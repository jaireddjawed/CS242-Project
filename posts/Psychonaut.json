But of course, we\u2019re more than our minds. Our mind is a problem solving tool and sometimes that tool can get out of control and look for problems, so we get swept away by our regrets from the past and worries about the  future. We can completely forget about our physical being and we might not become aware of our body again until there\u2019s something wrong - pain, tension, tiredness. If you\u2019ve ever had an ice bath or had cold water poured over you then you know what it feels like to be suddenly and completely aware of your body. But that complete awareness is available to us anytime - we can pour our awareness into our body.\n\n\nThich Nhat Hanh called the practice of body awareness \"mindfulness of the body in the body\" - for example, you can be aware of your arm in your mind but the aim is to take your awareness out of your mind and into your arm, really noticing what you can feel there.\n\n\nIts incredibly simple but also the most fundamental practice, possibly the most important part of developing a meditation practice. The body connects us to the here and now, it connects us to the present moment. Through our breath, through our senses, through our movement it brings us into union with reality, where we can let go of our suffering. The only place we can be happy is here; the only time we can be happy is now.\n\n\nThe reason I like mindfulness of the body is that it really helps to focus your awareness and while your awareness is focused, your mind can settle down. You\u2019ll still have thoughts occasionally - and that's OK - but by gently bringing your consciousness back to your body your mind gets a chance to rest, gets a chance to let go of the past and future, let go of worries and become one with your body. \n\n\nWhen we\u2019re practicing  mindfulness of the body we\u2019re not trying to change anything or fix any discomfort. It's about accepting and observing what is happening in our body without judgment. By practicing mindfulness in our bodies, we can bring our mind into the present and stay there - and that's what makes it so effective against our worries. \n\n[Listen for more](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/stop-living-in-your-head-start-living-in-your-body\/id1493806566?i=1000603726599)","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678637826.0},{"title":"AI video generation looks psychedelic","author":"jmbaf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11pwjzd\/ai_video_generation_looks_psychedelic\/","text":"I was really excited to see this.

This has happened to me a lot while tripping, where I\u2019ll see a carpet with patterns, but my brain keeps showing me one \u201ccarpet with patterns\u201d and then a slightly different \u201ccarpet with patterns\u201d.

After \\~1.5 years of being nearly teetotal (nothing except for caffeine) I began consuming marijuana again - I am not dependent on it, but I do find that it helps me relax in lower doses. As of late, I'm considering cutting out marijuana along with caffeine. I have already begun limiting my consumption of both. No set date of when to stop...just letting it happen.

I had a handful of experiences during my early 20's but it's been 5 or so years since my last trip of any kind. I'm interested in approaching it from a different perspective this time; rather than my intent being \"getting fucked up\" I'd like to utilize mushrooms in a way that is spiritual and healing...if my trip may allow me to do so. I'd like to microdose a few times before moving up to a slightly larger dose.\n\nJust curious, are there any other folks out there who generally stay away from any mind-altering substances with the exception being an occasional psychadelic experience?

He only sealed the syllabus of spiritual knowledge meant for the Islam religion of that particular time present in specific area only. For suppose, when the teacher says that the syllabus is completed, it doesn't mean that the syllabus for the next year will not be taught. Next year, some new concepts which were discovered in science may be added to the syllabus. Syllabus may be revised. Today, suppose the syllabus committee says that the syllabus is covered, it doesn\u2019t mean that some new concepts in that subject will not be added to the syllabus next year. The syllabus is completed doesn\u2019t mean that there will be no further addition of new concepts. Syllabus is completed in that particular time in that particular religion to that particular extent. It doesn't mean that no more change in this syllabus will occur, no new concepts will be added and this syllabus will stay for thousands and lakhs of years! No, it\u2019s not like that. For that time, for that religion, and for that region, Mohammed told, \u201cthe syllabus is completed\u201d. It doesn\u2019t mean that the syllabus will not be repeated again with new explanations and will not be revised again by adding some new concepts. So, it shouldn't be taken in a rigid sense. The statement \u2018***Syllabus is sealed***\u2019 is correct as far as the statement is concerned to a particular religion, to a particular place and to a particular sect of people.\n\n**2. What deeds cause a person to undergo extreme suffering due to deadly diseases like cancer, heart disease, etc.?**\n\n\\[A question by Dr. Nikhil Kothurkar\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** The intensity of the punishment always depends on the intensity of the sin. If the sin is more intense, the punishment will also be more intense. The Garuda Puranam gives the details of which punishment is prescribed for which sin, according to the divine constitution.\n\n**3. Why are some patients cured even from deadly diseases whereas others are not?**\n\n\\[Why do some patients get easily cured even from deadly diseases, whereas others reach a state where all treatments fail and all that can go wrong does go wrong?\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** If the soul is reformed, God immediately withdraws the punishments or reduces the intensity of the punishments. Even for a sinner who is jailed in this world, the period of jailing is reduced by authorities based on the character and conduct of that imprisoned sinner. Reformation means realising the sin, repenting about the sin and not repeating the sin again. Non-repetition of the sin again in the future is a very very important step, based on which all the pending punishments for that type of sin get cancelled in advance (***J\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni\u1e25 sarvakarm\u0101\u1e47i\u2026***\\- Gita). In the word \u2018***J\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni***\u2019 (realisation), one interpretation of the word agni (fire) means deep repentance and non-repetition of the sin. Another interpretation is devotion to God which is the main goal of human life. Therefore, the cure of the patient is based on the extent of reformation of the soul and ultimate decision of God about the future of the soul.\n\n**4. What changes in attitude does God expect from the person, suffering from a deadly disease and his or her family members?**\n\n**Swami replied:** As far as ordinary souls are concerned, punishments are purely related to their sins and these punishments are aimed for the reformation of the soul only. Of course, punishments cannot change the soul permanently. But, the punishment brings some temporary reformation in the soul. Therefore, the punishment ends as soon as the reformation occurs in the soul. Here, your devotion to God has nothing to do with the punishment. You may have a lot of respect towards the judge and towards the jailer but that is a separate issue. The punishment which is already announced for you by the judge will not change due to your respect. Neither the judge nor the jailer can do anything. Here, the judge is just a human being but God is an omnipotent and unimaginable entity beyond creation. Even if God shows partiality towards some souls who worship Him by cancelling their punishments, there is nobody to question God. But still, God follows the procedure of Justice without any partiality. He will never break the divine constitution and cancel punishments.\n\nIf a soul is reformed, the pending punishments are kept in cold storage and are not cancelled from the file of the soul. It is because the soul may be reformed today but the reformation may be disturbed after some time and the soul may do the same sin again. ***A soul is highly unpredictable.*** If the reformation is disturbed, the pending punishments are withdrawn from cold storage and delivered to the soul. Hence, the pending punishments are kept in cold storage and never get cancelled.\n\nIf God finds a hope of reformation in the soul, He may postpone the punishment so that the soul gets some time for repentance and reformation. If there is no reformation even after that, the punishment must be received by the sinner with added interest for that period of postponement. You try to butter God with prayers and worship to cancel your punishments but the omniscient God can never be influenced. You can butter up human beings, but not God. He only postpones the punishment to the next birth or to a later time in the same birth. The punishment will be delivered with added interest due to postponement. Without knowing this background mechanism, we think that God has cancelled our punishments due to our prayers and worship. Unless you undergo the punishment, the sin will not be exhausted (***Kalpako\u1e6di \u015batairapi\u2026***). The postponement of sin by God is misunderstood by us as cancellation of sin.\n\nWise devotees never pray God for removing their difficulties which are nothing but the punishments of their sins. If you pray with lot of devotion, God may postpone the punishments along with the added interest. But if you are reformed completely and don\u2019t repeat the sin in future, God will put your file in cold storage forever since you are never going to repeat it in future. If you repeat the sin, the file will come out of cold storage and becomes active. Therefore, do not worship God for the sake of cancellation of punishments. Pray to God due to attraction to God which should be the real basis for the prayer and do not aspire for any fruit in return like cancelling punishments, etc.\n\n**5. How can young people lead their lives to avoid suffering in the end?**\n\n\\[How can young persons lead their lives so that they do not have to undergo such extreme suffering at the end of their lives?\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** The only path to avoid suffering is to reform yourself and not repeat the sin again in future. Once you are reformed, God will keep your punishments-file in cold storage which is misunderstood by you as the cancellation of your sins. Your devotion to God is not linked to cancellation of punishments. It is a completely and fundamentally wrong concept. Only the priests who earn their livelihood say, \u201cYou do this worship and your sin will be cancelled\u201d. Yes! you do the worship and the punishment for the sin will be postponed but it will have added interest on it. Therefore, follow the three-step procedure for permanent reformation.\n\n1)\u00a0 **Realisation:-** You must realise that it is sin. Sometimes, you may be thinking that the sin is merit. You don\u2019t recognize it as a sin and do it. Realisation is called as Jnana Yoga.\n\n2)\u00a0 **Repentance:-** You must repent for your past sins. Repentance is called as Bhakti Yoga, which is theoretical devotion.\n\n3)\u00a0 **Non-repetition:-** You must not repeat the sin again in future. The final step is practice or Karma Yoga.\n\nThese three things will keep the file of your punishments in cold storage forever. As long as you don\u2019t repeat it, the file will not come out of the cold storage.\n\nThere are many types of sins. Suppose you have stolen someone\u2019s money, that is one type of sin. Another type of sin is killing another soul. So, if you stop stealing and never repeat it again, the pending punishments related to only that type of sins of stealing are kept in the cold storage and not all the sins! Every soul has several karma-files and each file contains punishments for one type of sin only. If you are not repeating the first type of sins, the file of punishments of that first type alone is kept in the cold storage. The files of other types of sins that you are doing are still active and the punishments will be coming. ***Hence, don\u2019t expect that the punishments of all types of sins will be kept in the cold storage if you stop one type of sins.***\n\nIf you don\u2019t repeat any sin of any type in future, all your suffering will end and devotion to God has nothing to do with it. Of course, devotion has one benefit that God postpones the punishments to the future which God alone can do. Only if you don\u2019t repeat all the sins, you are saved by God like this although the punishments are never cancelled. But there is an advantage here. When God postpones your punishment to future, you can utilize the time to reform permanently so that your file stays in cold storage permanently. Like this, you don\u2019t experience punishment today by worshipping God today and you don\u2019t experience punishment in future also by getting reformed permanently.\n\nThis permanent reformation comes only through learning spiritual knowledge. If a thief is subjected to a third degree of torture by police, he will stop stealing for some days, after he comes out of the police station. But after some time, due to the influence of co-thieves, he will repeat the sin again. So, the punishment brings only temporary reformation whereas spiritual knowledge brings permanent reformation. ***Permanent here means the course of time as long as you don\u2019t repeat that type of sin.*** Therefore, except the path of reformation of the soul, there is no other way to escape the punishment of sins. Devotion to God only postpones the punishment but does not cancel the punishment.\n\n**6. How could the same souls existing in different lokas simultaneously be doing the same activities?**\n\n\\[**Smt. Anita R asked:** Paramapujya Sri Sri Sri Datta Swamiji Paadapadmaalaku Na Shatakoti Pranamamumlu. Swamiji, Lord Brahma had taken away certain individuals and cows of Lord Krishna from Bhuloka to Brahma Loka. Lord Krishna again created the same individuals and cows on Bhuloka to avoid tension in their families. Actually, Lord Brahma is the creator of all souls. The soul is said to be an eternal object which cannot be created again. But, from this episode, it seems the soul has birth and death. Do enlighten me and forgive me if these questions were asked previously. How could the same souls exist in different lokas simultaneously doing the same activities?\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** Here, the Brahma who stole the cows from earth and kept in his world is not God Brahma from the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The Brahma referred here is Prajaapati who is the assistant of God Brahma and he does the routine actions (duty) of God Brahma. Prajaapati is not God Brahma. God Brahma does some creation and the same will be repeated by Prajaapati as changes occur. For example, that Prajaapati creates new children in every generation and the Prajaapati of God Shiva destroys them. Every soul born gets death. God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva are one only i.e., God Datta only. God Krishna is also an incarnation of God Datta and therefore, God Brahma is not affected by this story.\n\n\u00a0Another point here is that the soul is not eternal because the soul is created by God, who (God) existed even before creation. God being the creator has no beginning and no end which makes Him truly eternal. The creation, which was manifested by the will of God, exists as long as God wishes. Soul is not the Creator but just a part of creation, which has a beginning and end. Of course, it can become eternal (Chiranjeevi) as long as God wishes. The soul is called as \u2018paraa prakriti\u2019 where para means best and prakriti means creation. Soul is called the best part of the creation, which is only a relative reality. If God wishes, the soul can permanently disappear at any time. Since the soul is a part of the creation only, God created the same soul again.\n\nSoul is not the absolute reality but only a relatively reality which means, it is not inherently real. Just like the entire creation, soul also became real due to the reality gifted by God. For example, you had taken mud and created a round shaped pot. That round shaped pot is relative reality. Of course, it is also absolutely real because as long as the mud retains, the shape is permanently real. But, reality is inherent for mud and is not inherent for the round shape, which is called as pot. The pot is only relatively real whose reality is based on the absolute reality of mud. Here, mud is like God and pot (shape of pot) is like creation.\n\nSince the reality of God is gifted to souls along with the entire world, the entire world becomes absolutely real as long as God wishes. Therefore, God can create a duplicate soul because it is fundamentally unreal. After all, a soul is nothing but inert energy modified into awareness in the functioning nervous system. Just like how the matter is a modification of inert energy, soul is also a modification of the inert energy. When we take food, it gets digested and releases inert energy. This inert energy enters the nervous systems including brain and it is modified into a specific work form called awareness. Thus, awareness is a created item. Just like light energy, sound energy, electrical energy and magnetic energy, the soul is also an awareness energy. It is called as nervous energy. Hence, a duplicate of it can be created. The omnipotent God can not only duplicate a soul but also can duplicate Sun which is also a form of energy only. Energy is created by God as said in the Veda (***Tat tejo's\u1e5bjata\u2026***). Every part in creation is created by God and can be duplicated by God since the entire creation is relatively real for the absolutely real God.\n\n**7. Are there parallel Universes that are infinite too?**\n\n**Swami replied:** When you say several universes, it means that each universe must have its fixed boundary. So, each universe is not infinite but finite. Only the number of universes is infinite. But the word infinite is applicable only for the soul and not for God. The boundary of single universe and the boundary of multiple universes are not found by the human being even though they exist. For God, this entire creation containing several universes with its boundaries is absolutely known. If the boundary of these universes is not known to God, then God cannot be called as omniscient. Since God is omniscient, the boundary of the entire creation (a multiple group of universes) is known to God. The boundary is not known to the soul because soul is existing within the universe. Therefore, the creation is infinite for the soul but it is not infinite for God. So, there is no question of using the word infinite for the multiple universes with reference to God.\n\n**8. What are multiverses? Does life exist here too?**\n\n**Swami replied:** Life exists in all universes as per our Puranas and the Vedas. It is told in Vishnu Puraanam that unless God\u2019s grace is there, the human beings in this world cannot see the life present in other worlds. Unless life exists, God cannot get entertained. Generally, people go to see forests or hills for entertainment. There are some animals and birds which give entertainment. If there is no animal, no bird, no human being and there is only hill or forest, what type of entertainment comes? God doesn\u2019t relish such entertainment seeing only inert objects without life. Therefore, life is existing in the entire creation but you are not seeing that life by the wish\/maaya of God. You can see provided God blesses you to see those worlds.","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678676138.0},{"title":"Question for experienced psychonauts about the \"heroic dose\"","author":"mgegv","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11psa2x\/question_for_experienced_psychonauts_about_the\/","text":"I'd like special advice from experienced psychonauts, or at least people who respect the psychedelic experience.\n\nI took 5g in my first trip. It was terrifying, but ended up being blissful, full of epiphanies and life-changing revelations about the nature of our beings, it was my first time taking a psychedelic, I prepared for that for 3 months, reading as much as I could about it. I also meditate daily and have overall habits that keep my spirit strong, also I've been studying and reading a lot of psychology, neuroscience and consciousness related subjects by myself since adolescence. I've been obsessed with these fields.\n\nThe thing is, even though it was a difficult experience it turned out to be the best experience of my life till the point I believe I don't need another one and it totally changed my life and my perspective about it, it was exactly what I needed. I was reborn. I died in the experience, had a terrifying ego death, met my truest self, saw humanity as a whole, and understood what is this all about. I have a lot of childhood trauma and healing was my main intention, and the trip provided me with what I've been looking for in years, and more. \n\nThe thing is, that many of you don't think that taking that amount as a newbie is a responsible thing. But I believe the opposite, since I believe if I didn't have such a challenging experience where I screamed of absolute terror, I didn't end up being this free and taking my life this seriously and see this amount of value in everything. \n\nNow, I might be totally wrong and everything I've read in this sub points out that I certainly am. But there's also people like McKenna who professed exactly what I understood in the depth of the trip that dose brought me to. So, I want you guys to be clear with me (and help me get rid of any bias) about why would you think this worked this good for me on the first try. Why wouldn't work for other people, did my background I explained above helped me? Was it the respect I had prior the experience? My intention? What can set you up to getting the most for an experience like it happened to me? I'm aware of how many take +7g and get nothing from it\n\nMy best friend also took 5g the next day I did for her first time. She doesn't care about metaphysics and psychology, her trip though was more hedonistic and \"pretty\" she said she didn't feared the trip and understood things like animal life need to be protected at all costs, our western society is fucked up, etc, but in the end, she said it wasn't a life-changing thing, although she understood she needs to be more empathetic in general. We both took special care of our set and setting, set very clear intentions, we played the same playlist with slow and emotional instrumentals. We're still integrating it all. \nHer trip was so \"her\" and mine was very \"me\" and for both of us none of them seemed dangerous or risky, I genuinely can't understand how can that be so for regular people with obviously no psychiatric predispositions to certain illnesses, etc.\n\n\nI'm open to any opinions on why could a dose like that be so irresponsible ond risky and how can that can be paired up with this idea of 'challenging trips can be more \"life-changing\", I also base this on what I've read on many trip reports where people claim that after their first \"bad trip\" (considering they usually refer to +7g ones) they finally got massive changes in their personalities days after. \n\nThis is what I believe and I truly want to open my mind.

That was around the end of November. I've tripped a good amount of times, my first time being in 2020. At the end of 2021 and a bit of 2022 I tripped a lot more. Many alone and many with friends and one I went swimming in my pool with goggles and that was absolutely insane. I write this just because I want to write my stories out to other people to see if anyone else feels the same way about certain things so I know that maybe I'm not as crazy as I think I am. There are 4 trips that stand out most to me. They all end up connecting in their own ways as well. Ill say them in order of when they happened. I may not be able to remember a lot as well but I will try. Im listening to my trip playlist as i write this. Im also high.(Edit, I'm completing this draft sober, but a little tired)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, was with my brother that was in like summer 2022, im not too sure though. He took 2 tabs and i took a tab and a half. This was the one that really started setting me off on these egodeath trips and i had never really experienced it those feelings in a trip. I got to thinking the silly little \"man earth is huge\" \"MAN SPACE IS HUGE\" kinda thing but this one was like the start of these reoccurring \"bad\" trips. I put bad in quotes as they aren't really bad but just really intense at times. I end up appreciating everything in the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, i think this was summer 2022 like maybe July or August. I was at my friends house, there were 4 of us total and we all took tabs, i had 2 i think one was a gel and one was paper or both were paper i cant remember. One was 250 and i think the other was either also 250 or 400, im not too sure ab it being 400 but i cant remember well. My friend decided to vlog it and there is an unlisted video on youtube he posted lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe third trip was a mushroom trip. I decided it would be smart to take about 4 grams or 3.5 grams of shrooms and go to my towns MXT (basically a sort of IMAX screen except it is a lillll bit smaller) theater to go watch the rereleased extended cut of Spiderman No Way Home, that was right at the beginning of September. I had 2 other friends with me, one of them took a tab and the other just smoked and snuck his alcohol in with a flask. That one was the most controversial and ended not as we would've hoped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last one was in mid November. I just had my friend basically trip sit me but not rlly at my house off a gel tab, the dose was unknown. At this point i just wanted to understand my other trips and go back to that place i keep going to as i never remember well what i learn that feels so important. I kind of understand it now but at the same time not really. All of these trips end up connecting at the very end and i just want to know if other people have had similar experiences or can shine some \n\nknowledge onto me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a little background about me, I'm about to be 18 now, I've been smoking weed since i was in 7th grade and vaping since 9th...kinda not proud about it. I want to stop vaping but i am definitely continuing to smoke. I can be extroverted at times but usually im very quiet and in my head like A LOT. I have started looking into buddhism as it fits my beliefs on life now very spot on. My oldest brother is the person i relate to the most in my family. He has a point where he was doing a lot of drugs when he was 17-like 19. He suffered with a lot of depression and has tripped on acid he said like 50 something times. He is also a very reserved person but can get to talking after a bit of time to get comfortable. When he gets drunk though he has no filter and can sometimes get very uncomfortable as he is blatantly calling someone out while they are also very drunk. He will do that \"I know you know but you don't\" type of thing. He has a lot of very interesting thoughts about life and just the everything of everythingness though. Being his brother i sometimes imagine what it was like to be him alone doing drugs, I saw him a few times tweaking out. He told me about how he has had a reoccuring bad trip. After all these trips it makes me wonder where the hell we go during these experiences. (for spoilers, non are said in the second story but are in the first and third story)\n\nStory 1. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo get started. The trip with my brother was weird. I had taken a tab and a half and i think my brother took 2 tabs. He in the end thinks they were a type of N-Bomb but idk. There was a sliiiight taste but it wasn't anything i really considered at that time. We planned this for when my mom went out of town for this concert thing. We had lunch around 11 am or 12 pm and took it around 2. I told my friends we were doing it and they ended up asking if they could pull up way before me and my brother took it, it was only gonna be like 2 people. Let's call them Boa and Geese. I asked my brother and he reluctantly said sure. I said yes to them but they weren\u2019t gonna be there until like 7. Geese was gonna be there earlier. Me and my brother started the trip by watching the first toy story as we came up because i thought it would\u2019ve been a funny thing to watch. A good like hour passed before i felt anything from the tabs. Right as buzz and woody escape sid's house and sid's dog runs into traffic and the cars pile up, at that exact moment i was like \"what the hell is even going on right now?\". I can't remember exactly after that and up to when the movie ended. but when it did my brother asked if we could watch the first star wars and i agreed as i thought that would be a cool movie as well since i was already feeling it. We didn't get too far before we had to pause the movie. It was once luke it at Obi-Wans house that i started seeing Obi-Wan staring into my soul literally. It was like he knew i was there. I started then seeing the shape of the set, and i envisioned myself as Alec Guinness doing the acting infrong of the camera. At that point i just felt like i needed to stand and walk. My brother was definitely feeling the acid as well then too, he stood up fast and said \"yes yes that is good\" and he just stood infront of the couch as i kinda walked around the area that connects my kitchen and living room. He kept talking to me about cool deep things but i couldn\u2019t pay much attention as my head was very loud. I can\u2019t remember what i was thinking. I do remember my brother saying these things and then he woulds slowly fade out like \"and, uhh, and yeah\" and then it would be quiet for a little and then he\u2019d clap and go \"OH YEAH AND\" and it was a repeating cycle of me walking around in that circle, and my brother repeatedly doing that. At somepoint i felt as if i had just walked through days and multiple days have passed by. i noticed it and asked \"have days just passed by?\" to my brother. He stopped and lightly laughed and said \"no it's the same day\" and i just replied \"ok cool\". We sat back down and i think he continued the movie i cant remember though. Time passed and i was looking at my door at one point. Out of nowhere i see a shadow approaching the door. I get super freaked out but i don't say anything. It get's to the door and opens it and my heart is racing at this point. It was just Geese and i had totally forgotten she was coming. We were already like 3 or almost 4 hours in but she just comes and she smokes outside and me and my brother just sit outside with Geese as she smokes a pipe. I don't remember much of what we did but my other friend Boa called me when he was off work and he was like \"Ayo is it chill if Dave comes too\" i just said okay cuz i wasnt thinking and my brother asked who else was coming and i replied boa and dave but he never met dave and i know who dave is since he is friends with boa as they work together. My brother kinda freaks out and keeps asking if they are gonna rob us and i said no i knew them and they wouldn\u2019t do anything like that. He calms down a bit and soon enough they get here. When Geese arrived i didn't smoke but when Boa and Dave arrived i smoked with them. My brother went outside for a bit but went back to his room. He ended up telling me he didn't really like the way they acted as they do all have pretty big egos. I texted back and asked if he was doing okay. I was already feeling the weed mixing with the acid and i started seeing all my friends start looking like low shutter speed like time lapse effect with every motion they made, my brother came out side a minute or two later and stared at me, he moved in perfect like crystal clear image. He whispered \"Are you okay?\" but i heard it and i said yes. my friends noticed and just said \"Ohhhh yeah he is definitely tripping big time.\". Geese ended up leaving not long after and my brother asked if Boa and Dave wanted to watch Porco Rosso as it is one of his favorite movies. He was telling me he wanted to watch it with me as well. So Boa and Dave take their final hit before we walk inside. I walk through the backyard door and i dont remember anything. Completely blank. But at somepoint i come back and we are a good bit into the movie, i think it was near the end of the movie. If you have seen the movie before it's when Porco is above the clouds and sees all the dead pilots flying in the air and he is trying to get up to them but doesn't. I came back and i was just crying my eyes out slumped on the couch. Im still to this day unsure as to why i was crying. I was unsure in that moment too. The movie continued and when it was Porco vs the main villain when the movies audio got super quiet as the animation stilled moved started getting me into a trance. My breathing matched up perfectly with it and i felt as everytime i breathed out i could feel myself die, my vision gets dark, and since the audio gets quiet i feel my hearing leave as well, but then when the audio comes back i breath in and my vision gets bright and i feel myself come back alive per say. It's hard to put it together, but i ended up thinking the ending was about not trying to prove myself to be better to anyone and i mainly saw it with my brother and thats when i started trying to be a bit nicer to everyone in general. But the movie ends as i cycle through that dying sensation and coming back and Boa and Dave leave. Boa says to Dave \"sorry he was being weird like this. i guess it's just not his night\" and said goodbye to my brother and me and i said goodbye with a broken voice. My brother talks to me about very personal and deep feelings of guilt and just negative things i should change but in a good way. He put's on this movie Samsara and let's me watch it as im starting my come down. I still definitely feel it but all the crying and gut feeling made me exhausted. He left me alone so he could also be alone in his room. I was encapsulated by the imagery in the movie. I wasn't paying too much attention to it as many thoughts were also travelling my mind, i watched it again during another trip and understood the movie better but thats not a trip im gonna be talking about as it wasn't as intense as these others. but i watched the movie and slowly i went to sleep. I woke up and there was a mess of candy and other snacks everywhere. That was the first time i really felt that feeling of dying you get from psychedelics. I didn't understand it as much but i made me not as worried about death. I can't recall much from this experience compared to the others in this list. It was the first time having that intense feeling of there being something else that knows you're there and can see you. This one is the least intense of the 4. It taught me to be more okay with the way things are. And not not worry, it always is okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStory 2. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis one was at my friend house in the summer of 2022. This one is documented on youtube but it is only through an unlisted link. If anyone is curious to watch you can, my pov from when i started hard egodething wasn't recorded, but my friends reactions from it were. Before we tripped we were kinda all hanging out. This was boa's house as well from the last story. It was Me, Boa, our friend Thomas, and our other friend E. We had all been drinking and smoking a good bit. I had two or three 5% beers and I didn't keep track of how much they drank, I just know it was way more than me. We all then went inside after being outside for a while to get everything ready and then take the acid. We were gonna watch the movie Everything Everywhere All At Once on it because i had previously watched it and thought it would be a good idea, maybe it would've been better if it was just me or me and E. We take the acid, I took 2 tabs, E took 2 (i think), Boa took 1, and Thomas took 1. We start the movie and Boa and Thomas are both kinda bad at paying attention to things and were already kinda dogging on the movie because of the dildo scene they saw before watching the movie. We get a little into the movie before Boa wants to go outside to smoke in his car. I brought my starlight that had laser projections so you could see the lines if we hotboxed the car. We did that exactly, of course when we smoked thats when it started HITTING everybody. Me and E had already experienced pretty spiritual events on psychedelics but not as far as ego death id say. E ended up talking to Boa alone and I just went on a short walk with Thomas and at this point i thought me and E were gonna basically be spiritual guides to our other friends and we were both going into out different paths but it wasn't really like that. Me and Thomas just talked about regular things and how weird we felt and then walked back. I enjoy nightime a lot on acid but i also never have seen nature in the daylight while tripping besides once and i didnt really pay attention much, thats definitely something ill be doing soon, but back to what i was saying. Me and Thomas get back to Boa's house and Boa was laying in his drive way with E laying close by as they just stared at the stars. I think at this point Boa started getting into deeper thoughts that he didn't want to think about. So he says we should go inside so we can keep watching the movie. We start it back up and about 15-20 minutes everyone besides me gets kinda restless and needs to move, maybe because the movie was making them think too deep, but i was super tranced into the movie at this point. This is where i start losing all consciousness to the world. All of them leave the room to just roam around Boa's house. Meanwhile i again feel like the movie is speaking to me (this will come back again in the next story) but this time im unsure of what it's saying at that point. Soon enough Im not even paying attention to the movie but i am, it's hard to explain, im so far gone that the world is not real and im just speaking to myself as if only me and my thoughts exist. E walks in and sees me just staring at the screen, he joins me on the couch and we end up doing the same exact responses to stuff happening in the movie at the same time as if it was seriously telling us both the same things and our brains linked or something. Boa comes in and as he's recording he goes \"look its the loser club\" me nor E really acknowledge him though. He gets weirded out and leaves. After a while E says \"im gonna take a shower, are you going to be okay without me?\" i slightly nod my head and squeak out a \"yes\". The movie had ended by then and i was spiraling. Every thought i could think came to me. My visuals were pretty strong, i saw myself laying in Thomas's lap but he was morphing from fully fleshed to a rotting zombie corpse kinda thing, he was slumped over and the room in there was cold so i thought i was seeing the dead bodies of all my friends laying there with myself, the whole room including us turned into white paste and i attached  it to me being in a world full of semen, like thats the best way of picturing it, semen or a lot of white icing thats kinda melting off the walls. as i type this i kinda remembered why my brain was showing me this, it was trying to tell me that we have all been dead for years and this is how life actually is but we have made this sort of world in our heads so we can stop looking at all the gross horrible shit happening. i was so scared at this point but my body was unconscious but i could still like sort of barely move and i could still look around a lot and like realize theres a thing infront of me, but like, i just cant word it right. I don't believe the world is really us just dead but we trick ourselves into making it beautiful, but anyone reading this far, have you ever experienced a deep dark side to psychedelics like this where it feels realer than real life? because when i came to that view point i starting verbally saying \"nothing matters\" \"theres no fucking point\" \"it all makes sense\" \"its all bullshit\" just things like that, and i was looping saying those over and over. At one point E, Boa, and Thomas walk in the room. Boa has his flashlight in my face and goes, \"what the actual fuck is wrong with you?\". I snapped back at this point, i just saw him up close staring at me, i felt so much rage and anger because my own friend would dare say that to me at such a point in time where im super vulnerable, but i didn't have the strength to say anything. They all walk away again and i go back to spiraling. I kinda lost memory of this portion but i remember at one point i saw my moms eyes and smile cut into this picture of an ocean as if they eyes and the mouth were green screened on there and it made me think there are spirits everywhere at all times which to this day i still believe. I then see this picture of a sailboat just sailing infront of this plateau and i felt myself as the bottom of the boat or like a bird soaring in the sky, this point i felt like i was nothing. The whole room got DEAD quiet, the ac turned off and it was just my breathing, i see a tiny white dot on the ceiling and i slowly started getting closer to it. as i did the white dot turned into a white circle, almost a black hole but white, and it was sucking me in. i started seeing swirling colors on the walls of the circle, every color on the spectrum. I started realizing the randomness and everythingness of life after this. Boa had this cool swirly foot knitted foot stool i just got sucked into after getting sucked into the \"white\" hole. I felt myself soaring, this point i had no thoughts, no understanding of being a live, i was just, existing. I slowly start fading as it was around 8 or 9 am at this time and i fall asleep. I wake up to E and his gf standing infront of me as E cries. I get up and hug him, he said to me \"i thought you were never coming back\". He thought i got psychosis and forever was in the state i was in. I had almost no memory of that night when i woke up but pieces came back together over the months. That was my first actual egodeath and it was super super intense and i know i left a lot out but i also included a lot. Me and E talked about how we felt and then Boa and Thomas came in and Boa was still mad that i egodeathed and it really annoyed me how bad he was about it.\n\nThis was my first egodeath but it was not one of my favorites. However this next one is one of my most eye opening yet most horrifying and worst trips to date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStory 3. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis story involves me, E, and Thomas. My favorite superhero is Spider-Man, and Tobey Maguire is the one i grew up with so he's always been my favorite. I had watched No Way Home once before this, but they were re releasing it as the extended cut (september 2022) and so i thought it would be a bright idea to take mushrooms before. We got tickets to our MXT theater (basically IMAX but a tad bit smaller). I had taken 4 grams of mushrooms, E took one tab, and Thomas just smoked before and brought a flask of alcohol. I drove there and we were planning on Thomas to drive us back as my house was an easy 4 minute drive away that he'd be able to do if he was super wasted. I eat mine before we go in and E drops his tab. We head in and get our tickets, snacks, and then we walk to our seats. By the time the movie starts i already had a kinda bad feeling, the mushrooms were kicking in pretty quick. Since the movie starts with everyone knowing peter parker is spiderman and them peter grabbing mj and swinging through the subways i was pretty stressed out since the theater is loud and its a super big screen. The whole time im kinda having a nervous bad feeling but i power through a good amount. The point where everything starts going bad is during the condo fight scene with all of the bad guys. Right as peter senses goblin about to attack i started freaking out really badly but i was quiet during it. I just freaked out with thoughts in my head. I start feeling like tom hollands spiderman at this point and when his aunt may dies and the police start shooting at him i feel introuble, i think my mom has died and i think police are waiting outside the movie theaters for me. I thought a whole search helicopter was out for me. Goblin in this movie reallly freaked me out. The cgi really started popping out to me at this point, like i could see every effect they added as if i was working on the movie. When the other 2 spidermen come into the movie i feel as if they are trying to come and save me from some evil demise. When they all find tom holland in his special spot i felt as though they were all talking to me (told you it would come back). When they are all in the school science lab making the plans for the final battle i thought i was looking at me talking to different versions of me to find a way to save me. For some reason i had deja vu, i had the feeling as if i was dying again, but i felt like i had lived this before, i felt like i was in a movie theater before either dying or watching myself die, and from my trip and the time i remember it felt like the saddest moment of my life. And it wasn't like a memory from this life, it felt like it was a different life memory. idk if that sounds crazy but like i cant explain how real that deja vu feeling felt it was actually so insane. During the final battle i really just staring losing all meaning of reality again. I don't remember much of what i felt during it besides i was still in trouble and cops are waiting for me. I thought i was goblin and i had killed someone and i was really scared. The movie ends. The story does not end here though, far from it. The theater clears out as my friends watch the end credit scene. That ends and the lights come on, but im not moving. My friends are trying to get my out but im resisting really hard as if i was sucked into the seat. I then end up collapsing out of the seat to the floor. Im no longer in control of my body, im just in my head and my body is basically like a dead body but im still moving my eyes and sometimes saying things. Im conscience but at the same time im not. Soon enough an employee comes up and sees this happening, he asks and notices im acting reallly strange, so he has an officer come up who happens to be a narcotics officer. He starts talking to E (who is on a i think 200 ug tab) and E actually takes the rest of these events pretty well for being on acid during these times. He ends up figuring out im on mushrooms. He calls for extra support as in firefighters, more police, the paramedics, and of course all of our parents. Thomas was staring at me with pure anger he was mad i was acting this way again except this time this situation is happening. at this time i slowly started feeling the oneness of everything connect but i cant remember my thoughts as well for this one. Paramedics and firefighters come in to check on me. I remember feeling their gloves in my mouth and them putting the heart rate monitor on my finger. I get streched out of the theater, my friends parents pick them up, and my mom and her boyfriend go to the movies to see me. I dont think i was put in the ambulance at this point, i was in the back of my moms boyfriends truck as she was sitting beside me saying everything is okay. I stare out the window at the stars and think of the vastness of space. We enter the hospital they were checking me into and im slowly fading in and out. I remember being in a wheelchair, then a hospital bed with nurses and doctors surrounding me, and then i finally fully come back. ive come down to where i realize whats actually going on to me. I was having an MRI on my brain or head at this point and i was confused as to what just happened. I am hoping im still tripping and i ask where i am and the doctor goes \"you are at methodist hospital right now\" and in my head i do the biggest face palm and say \"fuck\" to myself. Everything that had happened in the past few hours comes back and instantly i worry about what happened to E and Thomas. Neither got introuble with their parents. I come back into the room i was in and my brother looks at me and raises his eyebrows and goes \"yeahhh man\". my mom comes in and tells her bf he can go now since she got her car as i was there for a few hours. He leaves and i say thank you to him for taking care of me and my mom and he tells me to be good. My mom was never angry at me for this she always said \"i think you just did it the wrong way and did too much\". I was dehydrated as well so that could've made the effects more severe. This one taught me a lot with being okay with how life is, but it also taught me to really respect psychedelics and not toy with them like i would with weed. It was one of my most thought provoking but my least favorite as well as it was the one that went the most horrible. Im just glad everyone was okay in the end. This final story is pretty intense but it ends way better and to this day i think is my favorite trip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStory 4. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast but not least, this trip was in november. I took a gel tab and the ug is unknown. This time i was just at home with E spending the night being my trip sitter. Not much of a lead up for this one, i took the tab and we were just watching some youtube in my room. Me and E have tripped together at my house a lot and he had his first egodeath in my bathroom shower, so we are both very close and we really like going deep into our trips. I ended up smoking about 25-30 minutes after i took my tab. We were hitting gravity bongs and i only hit one and that really started the effects for me. He hit a few and then i ended up putting a funny commentary track video about Spider-Man No Way Home. With the movie trip have happened so close to when this trip was i started going back into the trip from watching the video. E kinda noticed because i was acting weird and very like sensitive about what i said and so he went \"im getting tired i think im gonna go to bed\" as a way to not have to worry about me when i go into my deep trip place as thats what always freaks him out and i told him \"if i ever do that again don't worry about me, im okay in there\". So he went to bed and i started watching THE MEANING OF LIFE by Don Hertzfeldt and the beginning with everyone talking all those negative things started getting me into a really bad scary headspace, so i searched up \"how to calm down\" and stuff like that, and none of the videos helped but then i saw \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" by the beatles and clicked on it and it calmed me down a good bit. I feel like the meaning of that song is that life (strawberry fields) is a forever things that repeats and repeats. That's my take, im unsure if theres an actual meaning to the song. I end up saying its too much so i go to my bed, put my headphones on, and put on a blindfold. I wanted to try a blindfold while tripping for a while so i thought that was the perfect time. It sent me way deeper, i dont remember exactly what i thought but i remember it was. I have an app to record your feelings during a trip so thats what i did during this. When i had my blind fold on i had the feeling of dying again. i was super nauseous and felt as if i was about to die again. i was very comforted at the same time though. I ended up not being able to take it anymore so i connected to my speaker and started playing ambient music and i took the blind fold off. I went to my dog sleeping in my room and started petting her. I remembered all three spidermen and started feeling 3 guardian spirits over my head protecting me telling me everythings gonna be okay. This is the point where EVERYTHING from my past trips came back. I started feeling every human being born and die at the same time, i was breathing so well, i saw myself as the buddha sitting under a tree and it was pure and i mean PURE bliss. as if i was being enlightened. Im sure true enlightenment is way deeper than this but i feel like i had to have gotten somewhere truly deep. In my trip app i wrote this down, \"I saw myself in the movies again, as the spidermen, and goblin. i saw myself die as every single human ever but be reborn as every single human ever. i saw myself as buddha and started meditating without even thinking about it. The three spirits around me alone with my spirit and every spirit on earth and in the universe combine into one large consciousness that is life and the universe. the universe and space is just pieces of us who are slowly dying which is why space is a void of nothingness (dark matter) inbetween all the planets and stars which are us as well. But that nothingness is something, its all of us, every planet is all of us, every atom and molecule is us, god is the universe, god is us, we are god, we are our own selves experiencing each other at different points in out life times. when you hurt someone, you only hurt yourself. this may confirm every religion to be true or it may be something way deeper we just cant comprehend unless we all combine again at the same time to understand this whole consciousness that we make up and inhabit.\". I still believe we are all just a big consciousness that made the universe so we wouldn't be so lonely. The loneliest thing in existence is the universe. I believe we have lived the lives we had already and we repeat it until we reach the next level. People like the buddha have reached that next state. It doesn't have to exactly be enlightenment but we have to find ways to break the chain of this repeating life. Im not sure how to word it well, but i truly believe theres something deeper about all of this. The universe didn\u2019t appear out of nowhere for no reason. I've seen so many things recently that exactly connect my view points to maybe being true. If others have experienced similar things and have the same view points maybe im not crazy. The biggest thing to make me think this is the show Space Dandy, Mainly with the deeper episodes. The second season explains all of my thoughts perfectly. It's my all time favorite show. It can be so stupid and dumb in some episodes but then have the most heart wrenching most thought provoking episodes ever, and so many are exactly how egodeaths feel and maybe im looking too deep into things but i truly believe that show has a deeper meaning that people who have had that experience and understand it will understand those episodes more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, i think life is cool how everything just spawned out of nowhere. I think that there are reasons that ergot and mushrooms grow on this earth. They could be keys to unlock deeper meanings if used right. I am from now on only using them to go deeper into spiritual awakening. I find beauty in everything and i always know that life will be okay. Going with the flow has gotten me far spiritually, keeping that energy with life has been seeming to go super well with me. Ill find myself overthinking a lot still and having worries and doubts but i have a way better and way more positive outlook on life than i did before. I believe in the multiverse, reincarnation, the universe just being one big brain basically, and many of these very deep thoughts. Space Dandy and Everything Everywhere All At Once perfectly explain these ideas and they are my favorite pieces of visual art to exist. Life is beautiful, anything and everything is possible in this world of pure randomness, life is just a jumble of everything mixing with everything. Music is definitely other worldly as well. I believe music is something more than sounds we find pleasant. What do you guys think? Has anyone else experienced something insane like this? Can anyone say the think similarly to me? Do i have good ideas of what the world could be? I wanna hear your stories really bad and i want to hear feed back on what people think about my story. I took 2 nights to write all of this so i dont imagine anyone else's will be as detailed or as long as mine, but if it is go ahead! I would love any type of feedback. Thanks to any one who took the full time to read all of this and also respond. Much Love.

More info on all that here: [psilomethoxin.com](https:\/\/psilomethoxin.com\/)\n\nI've been microdosing with the dried mushrooms in the 75mg-200mg range ( dried fruting body of the mushrooms) for the last month or so on average 3x per week and having really positive experiences. Increased energy, mood lift, mental clarity, and increase in enjoyment and satisfaction on daily activities. I decided to try taking 1 gram and set up a time to journey with a trusted friend.\n\nSet and setting :\n\nWe took the mushrooms at 530pm as it was getting dark on an empty stomach. Quiet house, just us, we set soft mats and pillow and blankets on the floor in the living room and had a fire going in the fire place. low lighting, candles, and mellow instrumental \"mediation\" style music on a playlist. Both of us have extensive experience with psilocybin mushrooms and many other pscyhedelics including a handful of full release\/ego death experiences with vaporized 5MeO-DMT.\n\nAfter each eating 1 gram of the powdered mushrooms with a spoonfull of honey and some water, we did some stretching.\n\nOnset: noticed first effects within 15-20 min. Increase awareness of bodily sensations, increaed energy, and the slightest hint of nausea. Nausea was nothing compared to what I usually experience with even a gram of psilocybin and faded quickly after I lied down and focused on my breath.\n\nPeak: At about T+45min , as I lay down with my head on a pillow and blanket over me, it felt like a warm, electric sensation enveloped every part of my body and I was feeling my whole body inside and out. For a little while I was a little confused about whether or not it felt good or uncomfortable or a mix of both. As the peak unfolded, I encouraged myself to relax and let go into the experience, an soon all of the little discomforts, aches, pains, areas of tension that i was feeling in my body began to take on a feeling of pure sensation, as if my mind stopped ascribing meaning to the sensations, and it all just became sensation and it felt like being bathed in warm watery light. It felt very pleasant.\n\nMuch of the trip was body centered and my physical sensations seemed to dominate the experience. Not a lot of \"mind fuck\" or deep stiring of emotion. There was some review of recent moments in relationships and some insights into ways I was behaving that were not as loving as I could be,\n\nMeanwhile, during this 45min-90 period I expereinced some closed eye visuals. More than I anticipated and they felt similar in some ways to N-N-DMT and Psilocybin. Alien\/machine elf like beings that felt like tricksters, lots of techicolor light nodes, not nearly as vivid as a big dose of either DMT or Psilocybin, but they were there. There was also some fluid like vibrational patterns of energy showing up as visuals, fractals and stuff like that. The visuals had a bewildering quality to them and I was confused about whether or not I enjoyed them. Felt like a mirror of my dance the molecule increasing my awareness of the all the sensations in my body and my process of avoiding and trying to turn away from some of it, but then accepting and trusting and embracing.\n\nAt around T+90 minutes my friend and I started talking with each other an we were both very impressed by how easy and comfortable it was to communicate verbally while we we were peaking. Even on 1gram of psilocybin I find conversation to feel strange and uncomfortable and confusing. We both felt lucid and able to access words and clear thoughts easily.\n\nT+ 2 hrs, it felt as though the peak was over, and the confusing sensations and visuals gave way to a very peaceful, still, warm and connected feeling. Almost like MDMA but not as stimuated, talkative or over the top with euphoria. We sat and breathed, and felt the gentle but powerful bliss in our bodies, occasional talking about things. Did some toning and vocalizing and singing together.\n\nT+ 3hrs Still feeling warm pleasant glow and energy in the body, but nearly back to baseline and the thought occrurred to me \" Wow, I feel like I could probably drive home soon if I needed to\".\n\nT+3.5 hrs Hunger was not present until now, despite not eating for 7 hours. Desire for food grew strong and fast and we joyfully ate fruit and nut-butter and fruit.\n\nTook the medicine at 530 and even though I had come down fully and was essentially at baseline functioning by 930pm, I was very energized, and felt a string afterglow and was not able to fall asleep until 1am. I layed in bed enjoying the peaceful warm feelings listened to music.\n\nSlept till about 8am and woke up still feeling a pleasant, warm sense of connectedness in my body. Similar to a psilocybin or MDMA after glow. I'm still feeling that to some degree now as I write this at 1:45 pm the next day.\n\nOverall it was a beautiful experience. Quite pleasant, and I can see a lot of potential for healing this offers in the way that it seems to help connect people to the feeling of being in the body and supports an non-judgmental attitude toward sensations and feelings. It also seems to allow for fairly normal verbal communication at this dosage despite the intensity of sensation and energy. It did not rock my world with big insights or crack me open on an emotional level, but it felt like a lot of healing energy was flowing through and so far today I feel like I am able to function in life a pretty normal level. I would do this again and will probably try smaller and larger doses to see what thats like.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678571468.0},{"title":"Permanent \u201cAfter glow\u201d","author":"TigerLilyDragon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11p25y6\/permanent_after_glow\/","text":"Does anyone else permanently see in \u201chigh definition\u201d after microdosing?

This is a necessity for a drug like datura for which there are no set doses and health risks are involved.\n\nThe aforementioned statistic becomes 98.2% if 3 more trips are included where the user had presumably not done any dosing.\n\n**57.1% of the users were children\/teens**\n\nAlthough only few trips contain the users age, it can be inferred through various other means. For example bringing up that \u201cmum and dad were away so I decided to take some datura\u201d is a dead giveaway that the author is not an adult.  \n\nAge is relevant because a certain degree of maturity is required to safely use datura and so it\u2019s no surprise that the worst datura trips are predominantly from minors.\n\nThe age statistic becomes 61.6% if a few instances of young adults who still need their parents to wipe their asses are included.\n\n**84.8% of the users were trying datura for their first time**\n\nThis is relevant because it just goes to show that 84.8% of bad trips happened because the users hadn\u2019t followed standard harm reduction practices for datura. Had they started from a tiny dose, they wouldn\u2019t have had any false expectations about datura and they would have known whether or not they enjoy the trip it offers way before they take a dose that makes them seriously sick or delirious.\n\nThis statistic becomes 89.3% if we\u2019re less conservative and include a few trips that were presumably from first timers.\n\n**52.7% of the users ended up being hospitalized**\n\nThere is a lot to be said about this statistic. It is true that 52.7% of these users ended up being hospitalized but it is untrue that they needed to be hospitalized. A lot of these users were hospitalized simply because they were experiencing standard symptoms of datura intoxication. In many cases family members hospitalized the users for what was just a standard datura trip. So for example in the \u201cTrainwreck datura trip reports\u201d section of Erowid, 64% of users were hospitalized but upon closer inspection only 26% of them seemed to have actually needed to. It\u2019s also likely that this statistic would be lower if fake trip reports were not included but more on those later.\n\n**36.6% of users took doses of over 100 seeds**\n\n100 seeds is used as a basis for a high dose\/a dose that no one should be taking if they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Some people use flowers and leaves and most of those users aren\u2019t included in that statistic unless they\u2019re taking a dose that is obviously greater than 100 seeds, such as 12 d. innoxia flowers.\n\nThis statistic would be 51.8% if a handful of tea users were included or people who list their dose in a way that seems like it is more than 100 seeds but isn\u2019t clear such as a trip 1 from the \u201cHealth problems\u201d section of the datura trip reports where the user ingested half a seedpod and 2 leaves.  It doesn\u2019t help that a lot of people consider the volume of their tea to be a dose when that says nothing about its potency\/the dose that was used.  \n\nThis statistic would most definitely be higher if tea users listed their dose and fake reports were ignored.\n\n**9.8% of users combined datura with other drugs**\n\nIt goes without saying that datura shouldn\u2019t be combined with other drugs unless the user really knows what they\u2019re doing.\n\n**Sample used**\n\nBefore I discuss the most interesting in my opinion part of this little investigation, I should mention the trips that I used.\n\nI used 3 sections of datura trip reports from Erowid: \u201cTrainwreck trips\u201d, \u201cHealth problems\u201d and \u201cBad trips\u201d.  \n\nSince those 3 sections alone didn\u2019t provide me a sample size of 100, I also included the \u201cTrainwreck trips\u201d from the brugmansia vault. If you\u2019re not aware brugmansia is basically tree datura. I will refer to this section as \u201cBrugmansia Trainwreck trips\u201d.\n\nSome trips are included in more than one section but I have, as far as I know, only counted them once for my statistics.  \n\nWhen referring to a trip, I will refer to it by its section and its number, starting from top to bottom. If I were to refer to \u201cHide the knives\u201d from the Bad trips section, I would say \u201cBad trips 10\u201d. This is for convenience\u2019s sake but this also means that this naming won\u2019t remain true forever, since if a new trip is added to the list, then it\u2019s going to fuck up the numbering of the trips.\n\nThere are also certain trips in those sections that I have not included in my statistics for various reasons. Here\u2019s a list of them:\n\n\u201cHealth problems 10\u201d -not a negative experience and actually shows how to properly use datura\n\n\u201cHealth problems 14\u201d -doesn\u2019t contain any information besides \u201cdatura bad\u201d\n\n\u201cBad trips 13\u201d -a person has a panic attack and thinks they\u2019re tripping after ingesting 1 seed\n\n\u201cBrug Trainwreck 1\u201d -not a negative experience\n\n\u201cBrug Trainwreck 17\u201d -just shitty instructions on how to trip on brugmansia\n\n**Fake trip reports**\n\nNow the interesting part. After reading over 100 trip reports and having myself tripped on datura, I doubt the validity of at least a good 30-40% of these trips but I\u2019ll try to be as objective and conservative as I can and give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nA dead giveaway for fake trips is that there is no mention of the physical side effects. The poisoning datura causes isn\u2019t something you can forget or scoff off even if you\u2019re delirious. If someone\u2019s had multiple experiences with datura they may choose not to go over the physical effects again but as we know, 84-90% of these trips are from people trying datura for the first time. There\u2019s no way that they wouldn\u2019t mention the dry mouth or any form of dehydration yet many of these trips make no mention of it and the reason they do so is obvious. Being dehydrated and rolling on the floor looking for a bottle of water every 5 minutes for 8 hours cause you keep losing the bottle is boring, no one wants to read that and since many of the authors are lying and simply want to write a popular trip report, they never mention the side effects of datura.\n\nThe reality of datura is that the reason people don\u2019t want to use it isn\u2019t because of any hellish hallucinations. There are no hellish hallucinations and if there are they\u2019re not scary because due to the nature of datura, it\u2019s difficult for someone to be scared while on it, they simply don\u2019t care about anything. People don\u2019t want to use datura because it makes them very sick, delirium is far less concerning and certainly isn\u2019t unpleasant. Datura is a depressant, delirium is only dangerous if the users are able to do stupid things but they can\u2019t because they\u2019re extremely ill and usually passed out.  \n\nUnlike drugs like mushrooms there\u2019s a greater incentive in writing trip reports for datura. It\u2019s a drug that not everyone would want to experience and due to its obscurity and lack of users, there\u2019s no one to doubt the validity of the trips written.\n\nIt also becomes apparent after reading many trip reports that there\u2019s some sort of competition going on between them, trying to top each other, turning the scenarios crazier each time while straying further and further away from reality. The authors of these trips can look at other trips and say \u201cwell they believed that load of shit, so lemme write something even crazier\u201d and so the trip reports keep getting out of control.\n\n**Take for example the trip titled \u201cLate Night Parties and Everlasting Cigarettes\u201d**, it is supposedly written by a kid who took datura, ended up being put in an insane asylum then took datura multiple times again ending up in the hospital each time before finally \u201clearning how to use it\u201d. Not only is the scenario ridiculous but the author uses overly dramatic wording, remembers details that shouldn\u2019t be possible to remember and you guessed it, never mentions any form of dehydration\/dry mouth. That trip is fake without a doubt and it\u2019s a shame Erowid still includes it in its list of trainwreck trip reports. Nevertheless I\u2019ve still included this and many other fake trips in my statistics.\n\n**In the \u201cTrainwreck\u201d section** I find these 7 trips extremely suspicious: 8, 13, 18, 23, 31, 33, 34 and 43. (Note that I only listed those 7 because I read through that section of trips a long time ago, after reading an additional 58 trips, were I to go back to that section I would write off as fake many more of those trips.)\n\n**In the \u201cHealth problems\u201d section** trip 6 and 19 are blatantly fake. In trip 6 (**\u201cOn a Third Day I Regained My Ability to Read\u201d**) the user is fully aware of what datura is and how dangerous it would be to just randomly consume it. So what does the author do? After finding some datura seeds, he starts ingesting a few dozens of them \u201cunintentionally\u201d while on stroll. What follows after is the most copy pasted delirium: the user starts seeing insects and they become violent. That trip was clearly written by someone who\u2019s read a lot about datura but it\u2019s without a doubt not a real trip, it\u2019s instead what someone who hasn\u2019t tripped on datura imagines what the trip is like (though I\u2019ll give them credit for doing some research on the physical side effects).  \n\nTrip 19 (**\u201cA Glass to Hell\u201d**) uses extremely dramatic wording, makes no mention of any form of dehydration and has again the most copy pasted delirium: imaginary cigarettes and the author gets naked (and fun fact, the author from trip 6 also got naked).\n\n**In the \u201cBad trips\u201d section** I find trip 7 suspicious and trip 17 outright fabricated. Trip 17 (\u201c**This is Going to Feel REEAAL Uncomfortable\u201d**) specifically lists a dose of 20 seeds which is a small one and yet the op manages to end up in a hospital, that is unfortunately outright impossible. Other trips may have also had impossible doses but this one caught my attention because of the stupid and childish title. It goes without saying there\u2019s no mention of any form of dehydration in that trip.\n\n**In the \u201cBrugmansia Trainwreck\u201d section** I stopped bothering writing down the fake trips because I considered more than half of them fake. I have more experience with brugmansias so I feel more comfortable saying that a trip is fake. I wrote down which trips seemed fake up to trip 8 and I found that trips 1, 5 and 8 were the fakest of the bunch.\n\nTrip 1 (**\u201cDeath and Psychic Dinosaurs\u201d**) wasn\u2019t included in my statistics because I don\u2019t consider it to be classified as a negative experience with datura and because I consider it to be fake. The author claims that he\u2019s had multiple hellish experiences with datura, yet he purposely decides to induce another one and he succeeds. He achieves the desired experience and therefore his experience cannot be considered negative.\n\nSo let\u2019s discuss why that report is fake. Firstly the author writes himself as chad thundercock and writes scenes straight out of movie scripts. Secondly he says he\u2019s had multiple hellish experiences with datura yet he decides to induce another one with brugmansia. Thirdly, he\u2019s had experience with datura but not brugmansia, the dose he takes is 2 brugmansia flowers which isn\u2019t enough to induce delirium (and I can say that after trying 3 different brugmansia species from 50 different plants from 2 different countries). Theoretically there\u2019s a possibility that he could become delirious from that dose but he couldn\u2019t know that beforehand and the possibility would be very small, yet it conveniently happens cause otherwise the plot wouldn\u2019t move forward. (No mention of dry mouth as per usual.)\n\nTrip 5 (**\u201cForbidden Fruit\u201d**) this dumbass supposedly took brugmansia once and ended up in the hospital but later on while on ecstasy decided it would be a good idea to repeat his experience. It goes without saying it\u2019s fake.\n\nTrip 8 (**\u201cMoonflowers: A few Bad Experiences\u201d**) is about some dude who tries brugmansia and ends up in the hospital. His friend finds that hilarious and says he also wants to trip on datura \\*sigh\\* and he ends up becoming retarded. The author goes on to say that many of his friends tried and are still trying brugmansia and they all always end up in the hospital, in jail or dead. So to sum this up: the author got hospitalized due to brugmansia, his friend made fun of him for that, then he gave his friend some brugmansia and turned him into a vegetable and his friends are still doing brugmansia even though it fucks them up every time. I won\u2019t explain why this is a fake story.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere\u2019s a strong correlation between lack of harm reduction techniques for datura (such as dosing) and people having bad experiences with the plant. Had all these users started from a very small dose, 96% of these negative experiences could have been avoided. There would be no false expectations of a psychedelic trip nor would anyone be hospitalized.\n\nBesides highlighting the importance of harm reduction with datura, this investigation has showed that Erowid trip reports, at least on datura (and brugmansia), should be taken with massive blocks of salt because many of them are detached from reality.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678462065.0},{"title":"Psychedelics and Tea","author":"yourteafriend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ov6ep\/psychedelics_and_tea\/","text":" Hey Reddit Psychonaut Community!\n\nI'm a long-time tea drinker, and a relatively new \"psychonaut\"!

My question is its 1 week later. i have pure mdma and want to roll with a bunch of my friends tonight and have an at home roll party since we didnt roll at the music festival. do yall think i will still roll or do you think it will be severely diminished from the psychedelics giving me a tolerance?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678546241.0},{"title":"Why don\u2019t people trust each other but then generally assume that psychedelic entities are benevolent and not insidious?","author":"EAGLE-DEAF","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11nma26\/why_dont_people_trust_each_other_but_then\/","text":"People will barely interact with one another but there\u2019s an overwhelming consensus that the psychedelic experience is inherently positive and you should trust entities and let go.

It is the point at which you cease to exist entirely. It is a complete disconnect from reality and the loss ability to perceive the ANYTHING at all, forever. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI would also like to define a \"state\" as a \"state of being\". A state is something that you experience to varying degrees of awareness. For example, the sleep state is something you can experience to varying degrees of awareness. You can be completely asleep and dreamless, asleep and dreaming to the point that you only vaguely become aware of that fact that you were in that state after the fact, you can become asleep and aware that you are dreaming (lucid), and you can even be lucid in your dreams to varying degrees. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can also be in an altered state. That is being intoxicated. Some substances (such as alcohol or opium) seem to bring you closer to the sleep state - lessened awareness. While others, (such as psychedelic's) seem to bring you closer to a lucid dream state - a heightened awareness. We can see more, we can feel more, we can seemingly understand things that don't make sense (similar to dream logic). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd so, that is what I think becoming \"high\" is. It is becoming \"aware\" of the state you are in. And for me, somehow it means becoming \"aware\" that I am sleep. Has anyone else had this sense? That becoming high is truly what it means to become lucid in a dream. Like in the dream state we cross over into our subconscious. Like we go through this membrane that keeps all the chaos from the order. Like part of our brain is asleep ALL of the time until WE go to sleep and then IT awakens.\n\nAnd taking psychedelics is truly lucid dreaming, especially when you get to the extremes of DMT where you have a complete and absolute disconnect from reality. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know this was a tangent from my title, but I think it is all related. Death is the ultimate schr\u00f6dinger's cat. You won't know if you can truly die until you've opened that door, but more and more I don't think the death is a door that can be opened. I think it is an illusion. That it is only a door that can be observed. We can watch others die, and to us their death is infinite, but it is only infinite as far as we know.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678481717.0},{"title":"First time tripping questions","author":"Imdatguy416","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11o9py2\/first_time_tripping_questions\/","text":"I\u2019m 20 years old and suffer from severe anxiety and rumination.

To summarise it, I took a 5HT-2A antagonist before 75 mg of ketamine and I had close to zero psychedelic effect.\n\nFor the whole story, in the middle of the afternoon, I planned to take 8mg of 4-AcO-DMT. A nice little dose to have a beautiful \u201cguided\u201d meditation :). Just something to have some movement in my mind, without been \u2018carried away\u2019 by a too strong dose. To ease the body load, and I also took a good 6 grams of kratom. But the most important thing I forgot is that Mitragynine, one of the main active alkaloid of kratom, is also known to be 5HT-2A antagonist. And it\u2019s pretty serious stuff, because I didn\u2019t felt the 4-AcO-DMT at all.\n\nSo OK. No worry, not a problem. I have more tools in the bag. So, I decided to take ketamine in the afternoon. As we can read from many sources, the psychedelic effect of ketamine (a NMDA receptor antagonists) in not specially known to be mediated by the 5HT-2A. In fact, there are very few research made on this topic; but more to try to find what\u2019s at stake in the antidepressant effect, and many mechanisms have been postulated to explained it (1, 2). On the other side, some studies point the 5ht-2a receptor agonist properties as the main antidepressant function of psychedelics (3). This is obviously not a fully investigated inventory, and I\u2019m not a specialist. \n\nI can\u2019t say I have tolerance to ketamine. I taken a couple of time before around 60 mg and I decently feel a great effect. I always have nausea with these ranges of dosages. The 75mg after kratom was no exception, though. In fact, this was pretty much the only thing I felt : a very big nausea. I have to say I had some very minor psychedelic effects for brief period of time. As buzz always come in waves : maybe when the antagonist effect was at his low and when the psychedelics effect of ketamine was at his high at the same time.\n\nI found at least one study, who link ketamine with this receptor as \u201cdata demonstrated the direct inhibition of Kv1.5 channels by MK801\/ketamine and indicated that this inhibition may potentiate the functions of 5-HT2ARs.\u201d (4). Another one shows a ketamine\/5ht2a link with animals. \u201c In animals, behavioral effects of NMDA antagonists can be attenuated with the atypical 5-HT2A\/D1,2,4 antagonist olanzapine or the 5-HT2A antagonist MDL 100907. This finding suggest that 1) 5-HT2 receptor antagonism may ameliorate ketamine-induced psychosis and 2) that serotonin via 5-HT2A receptors may modulate the glutamate system.\u201d (5). \n\nThe most interesting study (6), if I understand it well, shown that an 5HT2A receptor antagonist might block an specific NMDA receptor antagonists effect : the increased extracellular GLU in the mPFC. If the latter is responsible for the psychedelic effect, the 5HT2A would not been directly involved. \u201cBehavioral deficits induced by NMDA receptor antagonists \\[which is : impaired attentional performance in rats\\] have been shown to be due to increased extracellular GLU in the mPFC (Moghaddamet al.1997; Moghaddamand Adams 1998). Thus, the modulatory role of 5-HT2A receptors on GLU availability may partly explain why the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100,907 prevents some of the behavioral effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists\u201d.\n\nAnyway, if the psychedelic effect of ketamine is only (or mainly) mediated by 5HT-2A, it\u2019s kind of a sad news, I think. Just like eating various food make your health better, taking various drugs in an intelligently manner and frequencies might make your brain health better. At least, of course, the subjective effects between ketamine and psychedelics tryptamine are clearly not the same.\n\n(1) What is the mechanism of Ketamine's rapid-onset antidepressant effect?

This is a common thing to happen after psychedelics, but I thought some might find it interesting if I would share it. Maybe good to mention that before psychedelics I've always been very sensitive.\n\nContext: this experimentation happened during the span of around a year and is now over three years ago and the sensitivity is still strongly present. During that time I took mushrooms, LSD and DMT. I didn't generally do extreme super high dosages, highest dosage was around 400ug on LSD but it was more that I took lower dosages very frequently. Also during my LSD experiences I have often smoked weed and sometimes taken high doses of edibles. I had been smoking weed daily for around 5 years to that point.\n\nFirst of all: after psychedelics and especially as a result of the LSD + weed combo I got a whole different experience on weed. It is hard to describe, but it felt much more psychedelic than before. Almost would have reminded me of LSD. I would see slight tracers and sometimes have a bit of a zoomed out or detached feeling. Eventually I started feeling some anxiety for the first times when high on weed so that was one of the factors of why I quit smoking weed shortly after. \n\nFor the rest I would say that every substance hit different. During my experimentation my sensitivity to psychedelics grew enormously and I could take mini hits like 10-20 ug and feel strong effects.   \nI became super sensitive to coffee, which made me not drink it for a long time. It also gave me a slight psychedelic feeling and made me super nauseous and a bit anxious. I noticed this even when having a cup of tea. \n\nDuring my experimentation my sensitivity to stimulus in my daily life grew enormously. Sense input on one hand, but also emotions. On one hand I don't feel like it's a bad thing, but in modern day life things can be too much though. Up to this day my sensitivity to things going around me, especially sound\/noise have never been so sensitive. Loud noises can give me a lot of stress and it is something I have to learn to deal with. A positive thing that I experienced is that I feel that the psychedelics did open something inside of me that made me emotionally more open and I am more open to let myself be touched by things that are beautiful like nature, music and other art for example. \n\nIn retrospect I haven't used the psychedelics as responsible as I should have, especially in frequency but I cannot deny they are super interesting things and that they can have benefits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake it easy, but take it!","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678410688.0},{"title":"Birthday Trip","author":"BerzerkHD19","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ne7l9\/birthday_trip\/","text":"My bday is next month and i\u2019m wanting to trip for it, i\u2019ll be in my hometown and want to invite a few people i care about to join me as they\u2019ve expressed interest in in before. it would be my second trip and i\u2019m looking for advice\/ideas about how i should approach this to make it safe and enjoyable for everyone involved including me.

Shit, now I have to go to classes in person and deal with homework and shit. I am committed to this town for the next several months now. I'll be dealing with patients and customers, fuck. It sounded so good in my head when I was high. Where am I going to find $7500? I am on a payment plan but still.\n\nI also decided to renew my $3000\/month lease while high on shrooms. I love living here and it's so convenient and nice but my current freelance \"job\" is a feast or famine. I've been technically unemployed since I've separated from the army. I am probably mentally ill. I am saving nothing while living here. I somehow got by with a combination of my savings (when I have them) and my income, but fuck. Now I am starting school.\n\nFuck.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678302081.0},{"title":"Which is the better teacher?

For some back ground, I've been using them as I transitioned from Spravato(esKetamine) treatments for depression since my insurance no longer covered them. I've been interested in psychedelics for a long time and would love to experience a trip as described by so many people, but it never happens. That said, I still do very well now and have been off traditional anti-depressants for over 2 years.\n\nThe first time I just tried 2 grams I buzzed up in a coffee grinder and mixed with camomile tea. Other than colors becoming vivid, I didn't get anything else.\n\n2nd time I added the juice of 1\/4 lemon to 2g with camomile tea and it was much more intense. No tripping, but the experience mentally was very similar to the Spravato.\n\n3rd time I did 2g + 2g an hour later with lemon and tea both times. Very similar to number 2 but lasted much longer. I also became very wobbly for the first time, almost like being drunk. When I looked at myself in the mirror, this is the first time I went Damn! I look stoned! I laughed quite a bit about it. Things started moving as well, still images on the TV screensaver, even the toilet lid looked like it was waving back and forth while I was peeing. \n\n4th and most recent time was about 3.5g with juice from half a lime and tea. I don't know for sure as my scale doesn't do tenths. It was somewhere between 3 and 4 for sure though. The rush in my head after 30 minutes for the next hour was pretty uncomfortable. It was kind of like when the world starts spinning when you drink too much. Once I was fully up though, I was fine. Things were moving like crazy. This is the first time I had a real honest to goodness visual. The floor, specifically the carpet not the hard wood, looked like it had a pulsating mist on it with bioluminescent looking light coming from it. It was pretty cool actually. No trip though.\n\nI may just be too used to my mind being in an altered state from the esketamine, but trips just don't happen to me. I no longer go into a session with any questions or expectations. I just go in and see what happens. When I close my eyes, I do see a pretty vivid light show and lots of imagery, sometimes violent. I'm never disturbed by this. I'm a huge fan of horror and monster movies and watch that kind of stuff almost exclusively. Also, I see this kind of stuff any time I close my eyes, I'm just paying attention to it more on the mushrooms. I do find that I'm very sensitive for quite a while though, even when I'm on the way down, to anything with violence or meanness on TV. I watched The Crow and Prom Night about 4 hours after dosing, and on both occasions, certain scenes made me very very uncomfortable. \n\nI'm not sure where this is going to go. I've been waiting at least 2 weeks to a month between sessions. I may try a 6g session next. I really don't like that initial discomfort though. Once I'm up, I'm fine and find it quite pleasant. Not needing the anti-depressants is great, but I can't help but feel like there's more out there for me. I do have some Blue Meanies on the way, maybe 4 to 6 weeks out. Maybe they will be different?","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678389601.0},{"title":"What\u2019s the science behind why datura produces such horrifying hallucinations?","author":"Skin-Tasty","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11mvo6n\/whats_the_science_behind_why_datura_produces_such\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678377171.0},{"title":"First time 3.3g golden teacher trip report.","author":"TheThotality","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11mplm5\/first_time_33g_golden_teacher_trip_report\/","text":"First time 3.3g golden teacher\n\n\nTook 3.3g on golden teacher. This is not my first though, i took pancyan in 2018 from a cow dung maybe 1-2g. Saw some pics breathing enhanced colors and empathy thats it.  This is my first high dosage.\nThis is not a complete report.  I've excluded personal matters about my life through the journey. I only include here what ive seen and felt amd did.\n\n20m: felt a heavt sensation in my head. Started to get focus.\n\n30m: colors in my room are now vivid. I sat down in my bed and saw some stains on the walls I've never noticed before. The floor and the stains started to breath.\n\n40m: i can feel the high now and decided to lay down and close my eyes. First time listening to dark side of the moon. Immediately saw two beautiful women, one white and black.  They're kissing. Lots of patterns and colors. The gold color is so beautiful. The patterns change depending on the music. I saw illuminati eye with goldeng triangle. After that decided to switch off the lights and see if there's a difference.\n\nThe first hour is a struggle. I keep thinking if this real or not. I thought that is this images from the mushrooms or can i imagine them before even without the shrooms? Then i noticed that the music is from the visuals im seeing not the from the headset, so im starting to be convince that im starting to trip.\n\nIm anxious too because i know there's people in the house that will disturb me because its not time to sleep yet. I don't want to be disturb coz i want to enjoy this without breaking my concentration.\n\nI'm a little frustrated because i want answers to my private problems but i can't seem to get a response. Its a struggle, i keep thinking about the people in the house whose gonna disturb me, and how do i explain to them about the experience because its so hard to describe, i want to tell them how beautiful it is and feels so good. Part still want to find answers but cant find them.\n\nSo i decided to just let go of this thougths and just enjoy the ride.\n\nNever listened to many Pink Floyd and i thought it was ok, but everyone suggest it, i thought they're like a Beatles or some shit. nevee been a fan to old music. ButMan! This hit different. Dark side of the moon is a roller coaster! Every songs changes the visuals and even my emotions.  Especially the great gig in the sky. I felt I've died and its my funeral and told myself it's ok. \nI can't feel my body, when i move my arms they're slow motion and it feels so good. Every movement i do seems so long and bliss. Sometimes i don't want to move and just feel the sensation. The funny part is i thought im dead xozr i noticed im not breathing. Sometimes i don't want to because it pulls me down to reality and break my focus. My eyes and mouth open and closes depending on the music. Heck! I don't know if my eyes are closed coz i can see things open or not \n\n1 hour: After the album end, I lay down on the floor\nIn complete silince. I can't concentrate again i keep asking answers to my problems. The images are now groustique, some hp love craft shit. I'm never afraid though coz i know this isn't real and just enjoy it.\nMy jaw started to contract and clenching slightly.\nGot back to bed put mt blanket coz i feel cold. Hit dark side of the moon again coz i wanna make sure if there's a diff.\nThis is where my face started to warp! My face is melting and It feels so good its like I'm having a face massage. I check if its reality or not apparently not. It's just my jaw having its on mind! I can control it if i want to but im so amazed that If I don't control i it will dance, clench, grind, my lips are dancing on their own! So I've just leave them alone and do their thing. My coz knock on the door and gave me something. I'm annoyed for the disruption and i tried ro control my face while to talking. Went in the kitchen and saw myself in the mirror zoning in and out. I said you ugly motherfucker! Haha. Ate something and got back on bed and continue the trip. It though i cant get back and the effects is wearing off.\n\n2-3hours: \nThis time i have completely loss track of time. My face is warping and my jaw and mouth are dancing with the music. I changed the music ro genshin impact. When the music stops they stop. Sometimes i would make face like venom or the exorcist movie open jaw.  I even knee rhe lyrics beforte they came even i never heard them before. I contained mt laughter or the people in the hout will get sussy. \nI saw creatures I can't describe like some polygons and shit. What standout is Mirian the bluish greenish mermaid like. She held my hands and i smile. I felt to happy that she made me feel I'm loved. My smile is like reaching my ears. I've traveled through diff places. \nMy jaw is so overused and felt the pain. I can control them but I can't stop letting them dance. Hahaha.\n I've cried here when i watched some video of my love ones. Its like the life flash before you die. Decided to leave coz i may end up commenting some b.s. haha.\nAnyway.\n4hrs: went in the balcony for fresh air. The houses outside and environment looks new they're on HD. \nI felt reborn. Realized and planning some stuff for the problems i have. It's private. Haha. I know the show is about to end i just lay down in the balcony and enjoy whats remaining time i have with the shrooms.

Suddenly it was getting pulled down into a tunnel by loads of witchy looking hands. Then I got shown a brain, which got flooded by rainbow colours, and then encased by a dog-like creature.

Here is my observation of  effects I get from LSD at specific dosages and when they occur. Tabs  used for making solution are Sunshineshop origin and accuracy of them  seems to be on point as 20ug of them give slight visual effects. I  started with 10ug and was upping dose by 10ug every 2-3 weeks and wrote  down specific effects I got that time that I didn't notice trip before.  For reference 100ug LSD=20mg psilocybin (around 2.5g of average cubensis  shrooms but they can vary a lot in potency)\n\n10ug- Minimal feeling, slight stimulation and mental clarity, but so weak it could be just placebo.\n\n20ug-  Visual acuity enchantment, surfaces get sharper and more 3D, almost as  if textures of all surfaces get more pronounced, slight breathing when  looking at wood or similar surfaces. All visual effects happen only when  staring at the same spot for few seconds, otherwise not noticeable.  Mentally more energy and wakefulness, of physical effects apetite  supression and excessive urinating occurs.\n\n30ug-  Pareidolia (seeing faces everywhere), analysis enhancement,  introspection, focus enhancement, immersion enhancement, better hearing  or sense of it. Seeing more details such as fingerprints on surfaces of  glasses, stains on the wall, footprints on the ground and animal hair on  the floor. Music stars sounding sharper, slight tracers or after images  when starting at single spot and moving hand in front of it,mild muscle  stiffness and shaking (magnesium reduces them for me), simple geometric  patterns appearing when staring at a single spot.\n\n40ug-  Tracers\/after images get more obvious but still require staring and are  slight and transparent. Colour enchantment begins, full rainbow of  colors would appear when staring at piece of recycled paper for few  seconds. Symmetrical texture repetition when staring at ceiling or  concrete.Some ancient looking letters\/hieroglyphs seen on surfaces as  well as labyrinth looking geometry. First appearance of circle\/snowflake  looking shapes(oriental mandalas) on concrete and carpets. Changes in  felt bodily form,feeling warm spots over the body, bypass of some  filters, mind no longer ignoring clothes so I feel weight of my shirt or  pants on me when sitting or lying down. Feeling pretty light when  walking around. Letters on phone keyboard get moved sideways forming  aztec looking grid. Time distortion not obvious unless looking for it  but when looking at stopwatch it gets obvious. 5 seconds pass in my  count of 7-8 seconds. (it doesn't seem constant ,seems like time is  stretching or breathing,for a second it will move normally but then slow  down for 50% at next second)\n\n50ug-Tracers\/after  images obvious even when not staring, seeing them all the time on  moving objects such as animals, cars or people walking and moving  around. Colour contrast become really obvious now. Some colors seems to  swap. Gray becomes blueish, brown doesn't exist,it gets purple tint  instead. Obvious frame rate enhancement. First dose at which letters  will occasionally transform to ancient\/alien looking symbols when not  paying attention to them.\n\n60ug-Most effects get more pronounced. Tactile enchantment getting obvious. Whole world starts getting what I call aztec look.\n\n70-80ug  -  All visual effects more pronounced and are present at all times.  Tracers sustain for longer and are less transparent. Step up of mental  effects. First dose at which I get carried away and lost in thoughts at  times,as if getting carried away by river current of thoughts. Audio  visual synesthesia gets a lot more obvious. Multiple thought streams,  simultaneous emotions, moments of obvious time distortion.\n\n100ug-  Standard psychedelic dose for most effects for me. Nausea at come-up  that is preventable with 1g dried ginger for me. Tracers getting opaque,  often having rainbow after effect. Noticeable ego dissolution, personal  bias suppression, weird feeling like being from different time(being  from aztec\/native american era) or feeling like an animal. Weird feeling  of clothes being unnatural. Much better early life memories access.  Music has more layers. (feels like you can listen to all instruments  separately but at once? ) Feeling almost weightless (even when walking  with full backpack) and not feeling tired at all when walking or biking.  World gets full of specific ancient patterns,mostly looking like  mayan\/aztec in origin but they do change with styles of music.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678381548.0},{"title":"Best music for ketamine therapy sessions?","author":"quit_your_stepping","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11msaar\/best_music_for_ketamine_therapy_sessions\/","text":"I started a 6-round course of IV ketamine treatments for treatment-resistant depression and suicidality yesterday, and I don't think I'm happy with my playlist.

ONE hour in I look to my right at my friend and I see a tear dropping down his cheek, he was crying while staring at a tree. At this point we were both peaking. When we stared at the tree it would break apart dissolve and turn into a vortex, like a black hole sucking in the environment. I could barley recognize my surroundings. \n\nTrees would dissolve into the ground and grow back in front of my eyes, except they would be covered in what looked like diamonds and weird psychedelic spiritual glowing rocks. As my friend walked outlines of his entire body would trail behind him, each a different glowing color. The outlines would not disappear, they would stay and begin walking on their own, like I was staring at spirits. Eyeballs would float across his skin as if his skin was like some psychedelic river.\n\nTHE CRAZIEST THING. We were standing next to each other and I held my hand up to our faces. My hand transformed and an eye grew in the center and stared at both of us. It was communicating with us telepathically and I knew that it was BABY BUDDAH. At least that\u2019s the message it conveyed. Me and my friend stared at each other, without ever saying a word to each other at the exact same time we both said, \u201cbaby Buddha\u201d.  I was LITERALLY in shock and I felt goosebumps cover my body. THE ENTIRE TRIP WE WERE BOTH SEEING THE EXACT SAME THINGS AND WE COULD FEEL EACH OTHER INSIDE EACH OTHERS MINDS.

I decided to take my first trip one night by myself, and had planned about a week in advance. When I got home that evening at around 6pm, I recieved some bad news. There was an email in my inbox that said that I wasn't accepted into the school I had been banking on. I was a little upset, but I convinced myself that I could still trip because I had realistic backup plans that would suit me fine. (Also chose 4g because i weigh around 200lbs and i always seem to need more of anything to get me high). \n\n\nSo, I downed all 4g at about 6:30 and decided to watch TV while I waited for the high to kick in. The first thing I noticed was that the next episode of Rick and Morty was hitting hard (The Morty Pres Episode). Each twist ending or music drop transitioning into cinematic shots blew my mind individually. When the episode ended and I was staring at the black screen, I noticed very faint rainbow patterns underneath the screen. At this point, my high was just looking around and being fascinated by things. Everything looked different, my wall looked so much like a mono tone plastic, whenever I opened Snapchat I saw fragments of messages splintered all over the screen. At around 7:15 I ran into the bathroom because I had heard that looking at yourself in the mirror is an interesting experience. I got passed it no problem and decided to turn off all electronics and just give in. \n\nI turned my light off, layed in my bed, but left my keyboard on as it has a light pattern that looked cool in the room. The first 2 hours or so I just staed at magical powers in the carpet, the ceiling fan was moving faster than the speed of light. A sign on the wall that had my name was spinning, and all of the letters were dancing like gymnasts. I looked outside my window and saw the houses looking back as gods. I remember this part of the high I kept repeating \"What is it\" and \"Whats the gimmick.\" i was very analytical of the experience, and I kept trying to find a vision or feeling that represented the mushroom itself. It sounds weird but I was so focused on \"trying to find the shroom\" that the first two hours flew buy. After that everything went down hill, I started thinking about my future and where I was going to end up. I never saw any visuals that scared me, but it felt like my mind was tearing itself apart trying to find excuses and reasons why I wasn't accepted into the college. It took another 2 hours or so before I was able to finally relax. I was so mentally tired after the second 2 hours that I just laid on my side and stared at the wall until the high ended. \n\nFor the next few days I said I would never take shrooms again, as I didn't like how slow and depressed I felt after. I did some more research however and I'll be tripping again in the next week or so with 2g instead of 4.\n\nLet me know if anyone has questions or advice.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678376865.0},{"title":"What are the snakes?","author":"Outrageous_Cap_6186","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11m1prr\/what_are_the_snakes\/","text":"What do they represent?

One is the thirst for earning money and the other is the religious fanatic. Due to money, people are quarreling, whereas due to religion, countries are quarreling. Unless these two root causes are eradicated we cannot achieve world peace. The tree will not die by cutting leaves and branches. It dies only by cutting its roots. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no use in earning the extra money. Due to excess money, quarrels, mental worries and several other problems arise. Finally, it ends in loss only and not in any profit. You have to leave all this extra money here only and quit this world alone. Your issues may lose that money given by you. Such sinful extra money brings problems not only to you but also to your children. Neither yourself nor your children will be happy and peaceful. This entire world is the property of God and take whatever is required from it. This is said in Gita, (\u201cYavanartha\u2026.\u201d). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn these days, buffet system is followed during feasts. In this system, large vessels contain various food items and people take food from these vessels according to their requirement. Similarly, God created this entire world and you can take the wealth from it according to your requirement. People are not following the same system when they are taking wealth from this world. The peculiarity is that most rich people follow this buffet system in the feasts but do not follow the same when it comes to earning the money. \u2018Esavasya Upanishad\u2019 says that one should return back this extra money to the Lord. Otherwise, the Lord will give the troubles. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn buffet system, if one takes extra food in his plate by over ambition and ignorance for a moment, he returns back immediately before starting eating. Veda says that you must return back the extra money for the God\u2019s work if taken by ignorance. In the buffet system if you eat the extra food, you will suffer from diseases. Similarly, if you enjoy the extra money, God will punish you in several ways. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this world, people belonging to any religion think that their religion only is the true religion. They think that the God of their religion can alone give the salvation and the worship of that God should be according to their religion only. They also condemn other religions and invite people to convert people into their religion. They do lot of work to establish their religion only in the entire world which shows their ambition. It is just like Alexander\u2019s ambition to make the entire world his kingdom. Alexander wanted to extend his kingdom. But, even he returned back after fighting with Porus (Purushotama) on seeing the loss of life in the battle. But, the ambition of religious fanatics is not subsided on seeing any amount of loss of life. Religion is considered to be backed with spiritual knowledge and the religious people are expected to be free from ambition. We can excuse ambition of any ignorant person like Alexander. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe heart of a religious fanatic will not change by any amount of kindness or love expressed in the appeals. Such appeals can change only the heart and the change in the heart is always temporary. Change in the intelligence brought by knowledge based on logic is always real and permanent. Intelligence (Buddhi) is considered to be the driver of this body, which is like a chariot running by the senses, which are like the horses. If the driver is convinced, the entire chariot along with the horses is in the correct path. The terrorist will not change by love or kindness shown to him. He becomes the terrorist due to the wrong knowledge that enters his brain. He was convinced by that knowledge. That knowledge can be changed only by the right knowledge. A diamond can only be cut by another diamond. Similarly, one type of knowledge can only be replaced by another type of knowledge. Then only, he will be convinced and changed forever. \n\n\t\n\nSo far, the trials made to change the terrorist were beating around the bush and therefore, they did not have much effect. Today, SRI GURU DATTA is giving the right knowledge to remove the religious conservatism. \n\n\t\n\n[https:\/\/www.universal-spirituality.org\/](https:\/\/www.universal-spirituality.org\/)","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678349809.0},{"title":"MAOI,Changa and Mushrooms \/LSD","author":"sologhost1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11mm0lc\/maoichanga_and_mushrooms_lsd\/","text":"I smoke alot of changa.

The amount of the powder seemed to be less than what I had in previous times and it did feel like it took longer to kick in.  But if I've learned anything to be true in this, it's that time doesn't work the same, so it could have just been my altered perception.\n\nUpon drinking the tek, I immediately felt at home..peaceful, balanced, like I was going to where I needed to be.\n\nHad the typical shivering come up, I cover myself in blankets for the duration and await the time where the cold spells pass.  Things felt subtler, more subdued.  My last experience was outstanding, and I would be lying if I said I wasn't hoping for a repeat, but this was good.  Felt like floating down the universal river of contentment.  My head wasn't getting blown off and I personally would have preferred it to be a bit more intense, but you get what you get.   If I had to guess, I'd say the shrooms I picked were a bit weaker than typical, it happens.  \n\nPicked a different music again, Shamanic drumming with om chants.  Actually led to a bit of an amusing situation.  I was holding my phone and I accidental dialed one of the people I had met at a aya retreat back in August.  Great guy, but with OM chanting music, he thought I was in trouble, because I wasn't aware that I called him and he heard OMMMMMMMMM and thought I was in distress.  \n\nIt was a great time but internally there was a great battle about something.  It felt like choose or decide and it felt..very important and not something to ignore, but I have not the faintest idea of what it was about.  I'm chronically ill, I get up, take my medications and attend any appointments, but I deal with the parameters that my life exists in now, try to do alright with all of it as best I can.  But it's not easy, nor do I always meet that goal.\n\nIt was beyond bizzare just laying there staring at the lights while this fierce internal conflict was going on.  My parents who I live with since becoming ill pop in and check on me from time to time, see how things are going.  \n\nThings are great, no worries, while inside I feel like I'm going through class 5 rapids for anyone that's ever done whitewater rafting.  I didn't tell them about that until last night honestly.\n\nI'm still confused by it.  Maybe more of an genuine effort to be nicer?

I think we all do.\n\nFor example, one voice says \"I'm hungry\" the other says \"hmmm there's pizza in the fridge, let's eat, or lets make something.\"\n\nAnother example might take place after saying something embarrassing with a friend. One voice says \"Gosh, I said something so stupid.\" The other voice says \"You are overthinking, they have probably already forgotten.\"\n\nThese two voices are in fact two separate parts of the self. However, because they have relied on themselves for the entirety of your existence, it becomes difficult to understand them as actually existing separately. \n\nThe first voice is the ego. The ego is your emotions, your body, your feelings, what you perceive, your sense of time. The second voice is the executive. The executive actually comprehends this information and then makes a decision of how you should respond to said stimuli.\n\nSo you've taken a bucketload of shrooms or whatever and you end up experiencing ego death, ego dissolution, whatever you want to call it. \n\nThe executive goes WTF!?!?! What do I do now? At least during my ego death, I disassociated from my feelings, emotions, my body, my past, my future. I was pure thoughts. I was pure reason. Pure thoughts and reasons without an ego telling them what action to take or even a body for the executive to move around. Unprepared, this causes panic. Even if it is like my case where it is not full ego death, significantly less stimuli than the executive is used to can make the executive panic. \n\nAfter my ego death, I began to question the self. Who am I? Am I calculating machine? Am I just chemicals firing off in the brain? I always felt like there was more to the self than this. That is because there is more to the self than that. Congratulations, for the first time in your life, your subconscious executive piloted your body rather than your conscious ego. \n\nEspecially during the period of increased neuroplasticity following psychedelic usage, acknowledging this can lead to a lot of healing. Seeing your ego from the third person while scary also allows you to see which pathways the ego has established that are helpful, and which that are only causing your ego pain. I think that when recovering from an ego death, even though the ego has once again taken the driver's seat, the executive is more obvious and visible than it otherwise would be at least temporarily. This gives you increased freedom to make positive changes in your life.\n\nSo there we have it folks. Don't worry! You are still there. In fact, you are more than still there, there is more to you than you thought. You glimpsed your subconscious for the first time and that was scary because normally, it only exists in the context of your ego. Now that you know it exists, it is time to think.

Are thought processes or feeling tones subtly altered by the mere presence of caffeine in the system, even once tolerance has occurred? Does it affect clarity of thinking or the degree of divergent thinking?","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678311946.0},{"title":"Justice","author":"unityofreligions","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11mfpct\/justice\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wwtrk8qtgmma1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=088b000411f4dc96f17104bbec6eea9ce4bac520","upvote_ratio":0.25,"created_utc":1678327844.0},{"title":"Are People Who Like to Trip Balls Healthier Than the Rest of Us? - New Study links Psychedelic Use to Good Health Habits","author":"CurtD34","url":"https:\/\/cannabis.net\/blog\/medical\/are-people-who-like-to-trip-balls-healthier-than-the-rest-of-us-new-study-links-psychedelic-use","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678275779.0},{"title":"Magical combo no one ever told me about: GHB and shrooms","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11m3sfh\/magical_combo_no_one_ever_told_me_about_ghb_and\/","text":"It's awesome.

Swami! Will there be satsanga today?**\n\n\\[A question by Smt. T Sudha Rani (on phone)\\]\n\n**Swami replied:-** Satsanga means discussion about God  with a devotee, who is very sincere about God. Therefore, the  requirement for Satsanga is two devotees and their tremendous interest  on God. This is sufficient and no third devotee is required. Even if  more than two devotees exist, the number of devotees must be minimum  (maximum three to six) so that unnecessary diversions are avoided. For  example, if many devotees exist in Satsanga, all may not be of the same  level of maturity. A devotee of less maturity will stand-up and say \u201cI  have to bring vegetables. \n\nPlease excuse me.\u201d and will go away. After  this, immediately every devotee will think that whether he\/she has  forgotten any personal duty and will not concentrate on the divine  discussion. In order to avoid such polluting persons, the number shall  be minimized as far as possible. Even two are sufficient provided both  have intensive interest on God. Shankara told that two or three or  maximum five or six are sufficient for satsanga (***dvitr\u0101\u1e25 pa\u00f1ca\u1e63\u0101 v\u0101***).  Jesus told that only two or three are sufficient. Quality of the  participants is very important and not the quantity. For a political  speech, the Politician requires as many people as possible because he  requires the majority of votes.\n\n**2. A devotee says Shiva gives boons that later trouble Vishnu. How to answer him?**\n\n\\[**Shri PVNM Sarma asked:** One devotee of God Vishnu  says that God Shiva gives boons to demons and due to this, God Vishnu  faces many problems. How to answer this devotee?\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** I have become very furious about this  question because today is the holy festival of God Shiva. I am a strong  devotee of God Vishnu and I find no difference between God Shiva and  God Vishnu since the Veda says ***\u015aiva\u015bca N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25***  (Shiva is Vishnu). Since you have scolded God Shiva, to preach you  properly, I must scold God Vishnu. But, My criticism about God Vishnu is  not from My heart but is coming from My tongue only because you have  forced Me to change you by answering this question. Unless I criticize  God Vishnu, you will not change. \n\nThe criticism on God Vishnu is that His  son God Brahma is giving boons to more number of demons than God Shiva.  God Vishnu being Father of God Brahma is unable to control His own son  in this aspect. When He could not control His own son, how can He  control the whole world as administrator? Moreover, God Vishnu as Mohini  is the wife of God Shiva. The proof for their marital life is God  Manikantha, who is born to Goddess Mohini. You are praising the wife and  scolding the husband. As per our Hindu tradition, wife is the servant  of her husband (***Kara\u1e47e\u1e63u D\u0101s\u012b***).\n\nAgain and again, I am saying that the above criticism is only to give  a strong dose of medicine to your strong disease of criticizing God  Shiva. In fact, God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva are one God Datta  only.\n\n These three abilities or capacities (power of creating, power of  ruling and power of destruction) of God Datta are God Brahma, God Vishnu  and God Shiva only. If you criticize any one of these three divine  forms, the other two forms are automatically criticized because any  criticism strikes God Datta only, who is God Brahma, who is God Vishnu  and who is God Shiva.\n\n**3. Kalabhairava is very frightening; how can such a frightening form give bliss?**\n\n\\[**Mrs. M Swathi asked:** In the recent miracle told by  Karthik mentioning the experience of Hrushikesh, it is told that Karthik  got bliss while thinking that Swami is Kalabhairava. Then he told that  he phoned to Hrushikesh to share his experience with him. But, before  sharing this experience, Hrushikesh himself told the experience of his  own miracle i.e. Swami appeared as very frightening Kalabhairava with  powerful light for a long time seeing whom he derived a lot of bliss. In  this miracle I have a doubt, which is that Kalabhairava is very much  frightening and how did such a frightening form give bliss?\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** Kalabhairava is a tremendously  frightening form and no other form of God is more frightening than His  form. Seeing that form, one shall get fear and grief. But, that form is  giving bliss to Karthik and Hrushikesh. I don\u2019t say that both these  devotees are more frightening than Kalabhairava (just a joke)! The  reason for the frightening Kalabhairava to give bliss to devotees is  that the inner intention of Kalabhairava is very good, which is to  reform the climax sinners after giving very intensive punishments in  special hells, which are very much different from the ordinary hell  headed by Yamadharma Raja. \n\nKalabhairava is the head of these special  intensive hells and Kalabhairava gives Yaatanaa (very intensive agony)  whereas Yamadharma Raja gives Vedanaa (agony). The intensive punishments  indicate the anxiety of God Kaalabhairava to reform the soul from sins  as early as possible. Hence, bliss is experienced on getting the vision  of Kalabhairava. If revenge is the intention of punishments, the vision  would have given the experience of high fear and grief. The creation of  hell and the special hells by God is for the reformation of souls only  and not for any revenge. Hence, hell and special hells indicate the love  of God on the souls and not anger and revenge.\n\n**4. Why does God choose only punishment for reformation?**\n\n\\[A question by Mr. K Abhiram\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** The best method for permanent  reformation is spiritual knowledge given by the divine preacher or  Sadguru. Even the punishment gives only temporary reformation. When a  thief is given third degree of treatment by police, the thief comes out  with a change in \u00a0mind but his mind is not reformed. Such a thief after  sometime again moves to do theft by the influence of co-thieves. This  means that punishment gives only temporary relief and not permanent  reformation.\n\n A soul may hear the spiritual knowledge from the divine  preacher, but, such a soul may not digest it due to its mental setup  (samskara or vaasana) even though the preacher preaches the same  knowledge to all with equal attention. But, some only absorb it and get  benefitted. Some due to their past acquired mental setup cannot absorb  even a trace of that knowledge and the total preaching is a waste in  such a case. Even though you put good seeds accompanied by good rain  everywhere equally, the fertile soil will be benefitted and the rocky  soil is a waste without any fruit. \n\nThese two cases are the extremes. A  middle case, which is slightly sandy soil becomes fruitful if some  fertilizer is used along with the rain and good seeds. Similarly,  special attention of the preacher will be useful in the case of such  middle level. In spite of all this story, punishment is also necessary  to bring at least a temporary change of mind. This can act as the first  aid treatment. Therefore, both the procedures of punishment as well as  preaching are necessary in view of different types of souls in this  world.\n\n**5. How did Shankara go into depression before the Goddess Adiparashakti?**\n\n\\[**Smt. K Devi asked (on phone):** You have advised that  when depression comes, we shall enter into monism of Shankara to feel  that we are God so that we can come out of the depression. But the same  Shankara went into depression before the Goddess Adiparashakti or  Anagha. Please explain this.\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** I agree that I told the devotees to  use monism to come out of depression and after coming out, the monism  shall not continue further. You can use a powerful medicine to cure a  powerful disease, but after its cure you should leave the use of the  medicine. Shankara behaved like an ordinary devotee to prove that monism  shall not continue after its purpose is over so that an ordinary human  being can realize this concept. This concept of monism is like the  Brahmastra (very powerful divine weapon) used in a war to destroy  enemies. But, you cannot use this weapon to fight against God Brahma  Himself. Similarly, you can use monism to defeat depression because  after all, depression is simply a thought only.\n\n You cannot use any  weapon against God Himself. Goddess Adiparashakti wants to teach this  concept to Shankara (please remember that Shankara is incarnation of God  Shiva and He is only playing the role of an ordinary human devotee).  The Divine mother withdrew the power from Shankara and hence, Shankara  fell on the earth without power even to walk. She appeared as a girl and  asked Shankara about the reason for His fall. He replied that He fell  because power is not present in Him to walk. \n\nThen, She told Him that He  should accept the existence of power or shakti because power and  possessor of power are one and the same especially in the case of  unimaginable items. This means that the Unimaginable God and  unimaginable power are having indistinguishable boundaries resulting in  one unimaginable item only. Hence, the Unimaginable power called Maayaa  and the possessor of unimaginable power called Unimaginable God are one  and the same. Hence, the unimaginable power of Maayaa is absolutely  real. This means that you can use monism when the real context for it  appears (like depression). Based on this, you should not go to a temple  and stand before God telling that you are God. In such unsuitable  context, you will be taught a proper lesson by God.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678249773.0},{"title":"2g trip planned sometime this Friday, 03\/10\/2023","author":"RecklessDriver_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11lgz8b\/2g_trip_planned_sometime_this_friday_03102023\/","text":"So I'm planning for a 2g shroom trip, the method of administration is Shroom Chocolate, and imma be honest it kind of tastes like shit but I think it's because it's supposed to be lemon swiss chocolate, bad combo taste wise but it hits like a bus and I can have a fun time getting high and playing around you know.

You say that God is embodiment of love. How to justify both these contradicting statements? At least, we have to agree that He is furious to bad souls.\\]\n\n**Swami replied:** If we analyse His anger on bad souls, it is deep love with anxiety for reformation so that the bad soul can escape the punishments of sins forever in the future through reformation. God is very anxious apart from His love towards bad souls. \n\nA father and mother become very anxious about their spoiled child and such anxiety is only deep love and not anger. When the soul is highly selfish in even sinful earning in spite of having earned for ten generations in the future, it is a matter of high anxiety for God since it leads the soul towards irreparable continuous sinful attitude. He throws such a soul into births of birds and animals because these souls are not bothered about even their food for tomorrow.\n\n The thrown soul is expected to get rid of its excess selfishness in these births. In the births of trees, even the sacrifice of extra wealth is trained. The trees donate the extra wealth like fruits to other living beings. Some exceptional souls which are not reformed through these said efforts are thrown into liquid fire for reformation as last resort. \n\nThe pain of the souls is overlooked by God just like the parents overlook the pain of their sick child in getting the medicine injected. The entire aim in every action of God is only the reformation of the soul by which the soul can escape the punishments of sins forever in the future. This anxiety for reformation of a spoiled child is not mere love, but is deep love. When parents of one birth have so much love, what about God?

The Cosmic Cheshire cat, chasing it's unknowable tail, across the endless vistas. (Quote loosely borrowed from Hellsing Ultimate)  \n\n\n**So, the Video Game Analogy?**   \nFor this to make sense, there is a very impotant concept to my belief here. The \"Monadic Oversoul\" Essentially, Everything is of one source. The tree of life, God is the Trunk, we are the tiny leaves. That is basis. A single source eminating outwards in infinite fractals.   \n\n\nWherever we find ourselves on that **Golden Spiral** (Reference to how Tool sings about it in Lateralus) the concept of the video game is this---\n\nYou, as you know yourself, is in effect, the avatar of a cosmic, divine video game. (The Holographic Universe Theory, The Matrix, you get the idea)   This means a few important things, and must come with a critical clarification. \n\n  \n**1.** This means you are here of your own free will. We **all** signed up to be on this carnival ride, for the ups and downs. \n\n**2.** That means you are vastly larger than your body and mind. Both of these are tools through which your Soul can act, but \"you\" are considerably more.  Your view is simply limited by \"standard\" rules of the game.\n\n**3.** This \"video game\" is literally an extension of the same Source conciousness and energy that manifests itself as **your soul and your body**. It's all composed of the same Source material.   \n(Which means the Golden Rule Is literal. Do unto others because you are literally doing unto yourself...*but also* doing it to God manifest. Coming reference to the bible \" for thereby some have entertained angels unawares \")\n\n**4.** This does not mean what we are doing is insignificant. Our \"view\" is only as big as the Game, or \"illusion\" (Hindu-Maya, the Illusion, and the concept Lila, the \"divine play\") allows it to be.  But make no mistake, our being on this planet IS your Soul's intention. \n\n**5.** Digestable Example : Fallout 4. A video game I enjoyed many hours of playtime. I went so far as to make a whole fan fiction in my head about it. Think of it like this ; Soul is to Human what our conscious selves are to the video game avatars. \n\nWe know all about the video game. What is going to happen, the whole story. Nuclear war, bunker is a lie, wife gets murdered, son gets stolen, game begins. We know generally, what choices we want to make in each play through. Maybe we will be a hero, or a villain. Might be the wife in one story, the husband in the next.  Each life, each incarnation of our REAL lives could be likened to replaying the same game multiple times for different effects. Sometimes you might change your might halfway through and do something radically different. Might do the hardest challenges there are like, no armor or weapons the whole game. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople intentionally do obtuse things in the game, and the game itself is written to be tragic. Absolutely traumatic what happens to so many video game characters. And much like life, some playthroughs will be intentionally (on a soul level) wildly different than others. Some may do things that other souls would \\*\\*Never\\*\\* do.  ((Said one green leaf to the leaf beside it turning orange in fall))  \n\n\nSo, our stories are bigger than we are often able to understand because our avatars are often \"cut off\" from the conscious awareness of the Soul or Player. The psychadelic that crystalized it for me was Salvia. It felt like I was plopped out of the video game onto the table in front of the player. Like the DnD character who rolled a natural 20 on perception and reallized they were surrounded by giant omnipotent gods. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it is not foreboding or threatening like any of that. But it was **wildly disorienting.** One of the most confusing experiences of my life, but when it made sense, it brought me to this analogy.\n\n**6.** *(Oh you thought I forgot about the numbers?)* The final concept. Your \"character\" does not dissolve or disappear. There is a level of consciousness that keeps us connected in the source. (I've heard it called the \"Supra-consciousness.) Responsible for taking your lived experiences and integrating into the source without you ever losing your \"you-ness.\"   \n**Importantly**\\- like a video game character you save because you may come back to it some day, **all** \"characters' are saved. Even when your Soul wakes up and sees the countless incarnations it has, YOU are not diminished, but expanded. Because You are not just this life, but countless lives.   \n\n\nAnyway, that is about where I am at now. Trying to process the whole bits and wanted to get it out there.   \n\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for sticking with me through all that! lol","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678166800.0},{"title":"Psychonautic YouTube channel recommendations (request).","author":"TransRational","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11kvzx4\/psychonautic_youtube_channel_recommendations\/","text":"What are your favorite YouTube channels to sit back, get high (whatever that means to you), and watch?\n\nFor example; I like to smoke weed, slow the playback time to .75, turn on captions and watch channels like exurb1a, Vsauce and Kurzgesagt.\n\n(yes I know about the controversy on that last one, no reason to hash that out here please).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t have to be restricted to weed though.

I'm 25 and know this guy since we were infants. He's two years older. He used to bully me in kindergarten but then we got closer as we were just a tad smarter than the kids around the block who felt \"stupid and uninteresting\" to us. So that drove us through the years really close, in our \"smart\" world. \n\nSince highschool I started getting a bit of distance noticing some behaviors I didn't like but that made him push even closer, get much more insistent with me and pushing himself in every other friend circle I had so he doesn't miss out. I tried and made new groups but still he was always there. And if we'd go out without him he'd get mad. \n\nFast forward to us being 25 and 27, having made some work trips to other countries together and with other guys, the same very pushy, implied in everything and taking it personally if he doesn't persists. Just last week I was about to hang out with the old group after a year and him somehow hearing that, came to my house after not talking for weeks or seeing each other for months, invited himself in, talked about himself and how he'll come as well to this hangout with the group. \n\nHe is super manipulative with a lot of people and I'm sure that he does it with me too whenever he feels it necessary to achieve his goal. He's a hater of anything spirituality related or anything implying that there's something out there bigger than him, even though he did a ton of psychedelics. I feel like that just massively solidified his ego. He is a huge energy vampire, \"loves to hear himself talk\"(said by him), never actually listens to understand, but only to respond. If you're talking to him, he'll be switched off thinking about what HE is going to say next, than say a half assed thing in response to anything you tell him and switch to himself. \n\nBut the thing is, he's still ALWAYS got my back so far. If I'm in any shit, he's the person I'm calling and he'll pull all the strings he can to help me. He's also up for anything, anytime. I could text him right now to go out for a 5 mile run in the rain and he would come even if he'd have to make an excuse quarter way in and quit. We are polar opposites as goals, dreams, desires, values, personality but have a huge safety net in each other. \n\nNow, other than the shoehorning himself into the group last week I haven't talked to him more than a few text exchanges for the past month and want to keep it the same. He'll move to another country and I'll write him an honest, open hearted letter about my thoughts, my love for him and how I want him to be better, along with some lessons I've learned along the way of life that he can surely apply and would be a world of good to him. \n\nAm I too soft on him giving this many chances, putting constant effort and hope in him seeing some light through all the darkness? I feel like that letter will be the last thing I'll do for him like this, then he's on his own. I do it because I consider him way more than a friend. I consider him a brother and I feel like a bro should speak sense into the other when he's acting stupid and is on a bad path. He is suicidal for years and he said himself \"joking\" when I told him not to half-ass this experience, but do it properly, that he'll probably die of overdose over there. So I also feel responsible in that regard, if he'll die. I'll feel like I didn't do enough. Knowing him he may have some twisted thoughts in the final moments and write some shit down saying I started all this and it's all my fault for him doing it.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678178315.0},{"title":"Why do people think of dmt as more powerful than lsd?","author":"Angrycoconutmilk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11lcpqs\/why_do_people_think_of_dmt_as_more_powerful_than\/","text":"Per weight it gets blown out of the water when it comes to potency, length, ect.

After lots of tears and a huge emotional release I\u2019m realizing how much I was holding in. I\u2019m doing my best to reflect and integrate my experience into my daily life. Going forward, will every trip be totally different? Or will I continue to revisit the same emotions\/recurring themes? \n\nMy boyfriend and I went away for the weekend and rented the most incredible house in the mountains. It was super private and we basically spent the entire time sitting in chairs on the creek. It was beautiful and green and it felt like the shire, lol. We decided to bring some mushrooms with us because what better place to enjoy them??\n\nI did a ton of research beforehand - on how much to do, what to expect in terms of hallucinations. Mostly I was afraid of the bodily sensations because my anxiety is really somatic, and physical discomfort is a big trigger for me. I was nervous but I honestly felt pretty well-prepared. I took some zofran (ondansetron) beforehand to help with any nausea. \n\nWe made a tea and drank it around 5:30pm. We went out to our spot on the creek and smoked a bowl about 15 minutes later to calm down. I kept waiting for negative physical symptoms to creep in but thankfully they didn\u2019t. \n\nI began feeling the effects around 6:15. My eyes were heavy and I was zoning out much more than usual. I was definitely staring at things and they looked a bit brighter, but other than that I didn\u2019t experience any visuals. Physically, I just felt higher than usual in my head. \n\nI was sitting there just taking it all in\u2026the stars, the moonlight, the creek, the moss, the breeze, my dog, my love\u2026I truly felt like it was the best day of my life. I was overwhelmed with emotion. It was good and bad. I was flooded with gratitude. But I was also suddenly acutely aware that I have so much to lose. That if it was the best day of my life, it could only get worse from there.\n\nI decided I didn\u2019t want to be negative, so I turned on some music. It was pretty chill music, but a lot of the songs were nostalgic for me. They reminded me of my childhood and my parents. I felt such a warmness in my heart reflecting on the life they gave me. But like before, I realized I love them so much and they won\u2019t always be here. They will die one day. And I sobbed thinking of losing them. I thought about how the songs I was listening to would always remind me of them, and that their memory would mean they\u2019re always around. For a moment, I felt like time didn\u2019t exist and in some strange way, my parents in heaven (from the future) were communicating with me in the past and showing me it would be okay. \n\nI started to cry. But I tried to fight it because it was so unexpected. My boyfriend encouraged me to cry. I was still letting my ego get in the way. I was too concerned about ruining his trip or embarrassing myself\u2026he of course assured me it was okay and held me while I cried. I kept saying \u201cI promise I\u2019m having a good time\u201d while I cried\u2026tears of joy and fear and sadness and love. Just absolute overwhelming emotion. \n\nAfter awhile we decided to go inside and get comfortable. I had gotten super overstimulated outside and I couldn\u2019t handle all of the external beauty with the emotions I was feeling. After we went inside, I cried some more. Just sobbed into the bed until I couldn\u2019t anymore. Things started to return to normal over the next hour or so. More weed helped with the comedown. \n\nAfter lots of tears and a huge emotional release I was suuuuper off the next day. I had a full headache and felt generally off\/clouded. Doing much better on day 2. \n\nBut now I\u2019m realizing how much I was holding in. I\u2019m going to do my best to reflect and integrate my experience into my daily life.  admit I was expecting mostly visual effects and some euphoria. Instead I got no visuals and a huge emotional release. Overall, I\u2019d say it was a good experience. Definitely going to take me time to process. \n\nNow\u2026going forward, will every trip be totally different? Or will I continue to revisit these same emotions\/recurring themes? Also, was my dose not high enough to experience visual effects, or was it more than likely due to my SSRI?

The twist, is the day before we went camping I got the flu, but the sunk cost fallacy had me go ahead and stick with the plan, and after a sleepless first night in near freezing temperatures and running a fever, I took some Dayquil and Afrin we ate the mushrooms at around 9:30am on Sunday. \n\nStarting out, I was a bit dizzy and nauseous, so I sat on a stump for a while watching to trees move while my girlfriend sat in the tent. After about 45 minutes, I felt confident I wouldn't throw up, so I joined her in the tent and laid down to enjoy the trip. My girlfriend, however, was stuck either saying \"wait, what?\" Or \"I'm confused\" over and over again, as if she were stuck in a loop. It was around then that all of reality completely fell apart around me. \n\nAll structure broke down, and I was just a mote of consciousness, floating in a vast ocean of chaos. My girlfriend was there, driven insane by the chaos around us, as I tried to comfort her. After a half hour of her non-stop talking about being confused, I became her. I was in her trip with her, I was her, her words were my words, her experiences my experiences. I opened eyes I didn't know I had closed, and was back in the tent. It was 11am, and I knew we should drink some water or eat something, but at the time I couldn't make my body move. I blink, and am thrust back into the chaos. \n\nThis time, things are more clear, as I realize nothing is real. My girlfriend was not a separate consciousness, not really. I was a lone mind, driven so insane by the loneliness and chaos that I split my mind in two to give myself some company, which gave me my girlfriend. But she got driven insane herself by the chaos and loneliness; my only company in this the chaos was broken, and needed my help. She was lost without the structure of reality, and was not able to do anything about her state, so I got to work rebuilding reality from scratch. \n\nIf felt like an eternity, working out how to structure everything back to the \"normal\" we invented to pretend we were sane before the mushrooms undid it, but I was eventually able to open my eyes again. It was a bit past 1pm now, and I realised my girlfriend had mixed in \"I need food, I need to eat\" to her vocabulary. We had gotten a few cans of soup for this, so I manage to make myself stand up and leave the tent so I could finish putting the universe back together outside. \n\nMy girlfriend didn't want me to leave the tent, but there was nothing but chaos in there so I knew if she would just come outside she could start to feel normal again. Or rather, we could start to delude ourselves and pretend everything existed and we weren't insane and alone. But of course, she was not able to. So I resumed my role, my purpose, as a \"doer\" and got to work again. I found the soup, poured hers into our pot and put in on the embers of our campfire to try and warm it so it would taste better, and sat on a bench with my can of Gardein Be'f and Vegetable soup. It looked gross and I felt nauseous, but I hadn't eaten in about 18 hours at this point so I knew I had to. Best damn cold soup I've ever eaten, gave me the energy I needed to finish recreating reality and structure everything. \n\nI started to feel sick and feverish after eating, though, so I created (noticed) my car that would have comfy seats and A\/C and just knew we would feel better and more normal if we went and sat in the car for a while. It was almost 2pm at this point, my girlfriend still hadn't stopped talking about being confused, but I eventually managed to coax her into the car because she didn't want to be alone and I said I was going either way. I wouldn't have really left her, she was me and I made her, then I unmade reality and drove her insane, so I had a duty to look after her. But the car was the opposite of chaos, and we NEEDED to go there. By 2, we were in the car. \n\nThe rest of it was finishing coming down, coping with what we just went through, talking about how it went, etc. She said she never wanted to do shrooms again, I admitted I probably would. We agreed it was stupid to come out camping when I have the flu, and decided to leave two days early. Her trip had her deal with a lot from her childhood and how she treated her (much younger) sisters when she was a teenager. Her parents are both neglectful and they're going through a messy separation, and her sisters live with her mother (who she has been N\/C with) about 8 hours away.

Everything emerges out of you and eventually returns back to you.\n\nYour body is a pretty big loop. Inside this loop is many smaller loops: your fingers, your toes, your eyes, your cells, your neurons - and your thoughts.\n\nBecause everything and your body is a loop that starts and stops at the same point, everything is the same thing: YOU.\n\nAt the point of your birth, and the point of the birth of the universe, you blow yourself up out of nothing, like a balloon. You make the loop bigger.\n\nAt first, it only took one \"step\" to get from YOU back to YOU. As the balloon\/the loop got bigger, it took more steps to get back to YOU. Now, you have to go to work, get food, have sex, read reddit and do all the things you do, just to get back to YOU. In other words: birth and death are the same point, seperated by the illusion of life.\n\nOur consciousness always inhabits an individual loop in order to \"complete\" it, i.e. to realize it is a loop so consciousness can free itself from the loop and continue on to another.\n\nWhen a cell dies, its loop is completed and the consciousness of this cell can continue on. OR: Consciousness refuses to stop the loop and wants to make the loop even bigger - a loop comprised of many cells\/your body. So consciousness will now have to complete all the loops in your body to be able continue on.\n\nThis is the \"Grand Cosmic Joke\" some people realize on N2O: The point you want to arrive at by living, is YOU. And the loops you have to complete until you arrive at YOU are your own making. You never had to create so many big loops to arrive at YOU, because you always are and will be YOU. But you created the loops anyways. Why? Because why not? Its funny.\n\nN2O cuts these loops temporarily, sometimes permanently. The tingling you feel in your body is the feeling of the loops inside your cells being cut. The reason you laugh on N2O, is because your thought loops are being cut. You realize that all you have been thinking about is meaningless, because all thought departs and arrives at the same point: YOU. When we dont realise that we think in loops, we take our thoughts seriously, as if they have some meaning. When we dont realise that we live in loops, we take our lives seriously, as if our lives have any purpose, as if we live in order to arrive somewhere. We laugh on N2O because we realise that our live has no purpose and no meaning, because we will always arrive at the point that we started from: YOU.","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678114092.0},{"title":"psychedelic safety 101: tips for a safe and enjoyable trip","author":"sensepsyche","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/NQwdbtSLodo","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678125380.0},{"title":"Loud and spacey inner voice on weed.","author":"TheAlienCostume","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11k27c3\/loud_and_spacey_inner_voice_on_weed\/","text":"When I trip on LSD several times a month and then in the next days (sometimes weeks) smoke strong sativa strains my inner voice gets loud and spacey.\nIt sometimes connects to the background noise when I\u2019m on my balcony, kinda like trying to interpret it and almost feels like a second inner voice, different from my normal thoughts, however I still know that it\u2019s mine.\n\nI have ocd with intrusive thoughts and paranoia about getting psychotic, so sometimes it freaks me out but then I realize it\u2019s just me and start controlling it.\nI can even \u201eplay\u201d different songs with it and make it say whatever I want and it feels like it\u2019s in my mind but at the same time around me.\nI even made it say \u201eThats just me and my thoughts, I\u2019m not psychotic\u201d to kinda calm myself down. \nI also need to focus on the external stimuli to hear it.\n\nOf course I also get some LSD like visuals and a pretty psychedelic headspace in general but a lot more anxious.\n\nAfter some time weed gets pretty dull and normal again, I guess I should note that I\u2019m a daily smoker.\n\nDid you guys ever experience anything similar?

And I remember them quite vividly now, so I've started considering my dreams to be mini trips. (Possibly, my brain was rewired into that way of thinking? Idk. Let me know if anyone else has that experience)\n\nAnyways I had a dream not long ago that reminds me very much of what some here describe as a vision of the afterlife and hell.\n\nStatement begins (can't wait for series 2. If you know you know)\n\nI met a gatekeeper of sorts who was very protective of his things and territory, which seemed to be a half build shed and a small junkyard. He was an old man who would use a whip to attack me if i got too close. He told me to leave and never come back if i ever wanted to keep what i already have. I persisted. And to get passed, I needed to run across this small bridge over a ravine in the ground as fast as possible. On the other side, I met an old man who had stolen the gatekeepers whip. He reminded me of Yoda in his manorisms, but he was hard to look at. But he had the most joyful aura about him, I just felt good around him.\n\nThe old man tried to give me the the bullwhip, but I didn't want it, because I already had so much. I was pushing two boxes filled with random items I owned.\n\nWe started to push our items up a hill until we reached the end of a line of people, I got in line, I don't know where the old man had gone. Eventually, this lady and her two kids were kinda annoying, the kids running around, and the mom doing nothing about it. The kids wanted some lemonade I had, and instead of asking me, the mom just told them to make sure they find a cup first, then they can have as much as they like. I told them that was rude and they should ask me first, so the lady sighed and asked me if they could have the lemonade. I said no and poured the lemonade out because I was upset that they didn't ask in the first place. (Definitely some self narrative here...)\n\nAs we got closer to the top of the hill, we saw an old abandoned school. As we slowly made our way inside we filled up the first room where a voice in our heads told us that once an hour we would need to get rid of at least one item we owned, if we did not then we would die. \n\nI had already gotten rid of stuff because I was getting tired of pushing it up the hill. So I was scared and only had 5 or 6 items left. Including a Bible (i haven't owned a bible in almost five years) and a book of American history among a couple of other things. \n\nInside the school was torment, it was flooded with dirty water and mold and it smelled awful. It was dark, and people were all huddled in corners with their belongings, trying to decide what to get rid of next.\n\nI found my corner in a flooded school room and waited, slowly giving away my items.\n\nAt one point, I gave an item away, but the officiater said that it was someone else's belonging, and I still had to give up something else. During the whole dream, it felt like I was being targeted and treated unfairly. \n\nBy the end, all I had left was my Bible, I was tearing out each individual book, treating them each as an item, trying to spread out my time. Eventually, I had only the book of Rvelations left. Other people still had plenty of items, but many of us were down to our last. I saw people who had nothing left melt away in pools of blood, tears, and fear. I watched and gave my last item away. Once the next hour came around, I had nothing left to give and where other people begged and pleaded to be saved or given items from other people for them to share. I decided I only had one thing left to give... myself. So I gave myself away, and instead of melting away and dying a horrible death, I was saved. I left the school and entered a sunny place where only a few survived. The old man i couldn't look at was there, but he wasn't a man, he was a feeling, I couldn't see him but I knew I was with him and it was bliss. I sat down and cried with tears of joy, and then I woke up.\n\nSorry for the long-winded story. I know not everyone enjoys hearing about dreams, but I felt it fit here as these types of dreams have become incredibly common now after I started tripping.\n\nMy personal takeaway is the realization that everything we have on earth is borrowed, not owned, and that includes our lives. The more willing we are to release these things, faults, and flaws included, the more open we are to a happier eternity.\n\nTell me your thoughts if you have any!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678124639.0},{"title":"Conducting a study on psychotic symptoms and psychedelic drugs.

I'd never felt so wanted and once or more a day was common. \n\nA few months pass, we both are interested in tripping and so we get some LSD. \n\n2 tabs, strong for me, many things happened during a storm, we were together but many times had to move through or interact with other people. \n\nAt some point we stopped connecting and it felt like she was no longer there, then the strangest thing happened, I was staring into her eyes and from my perspective i experienced the oneness and silence that we both are.\n\nShe kind of flipped then afterwards, starting joking the kind of joke to bring the ego back and make life about the ego again. Instead of connecting on that level, she insulted me in a joking way, I can't really remember what because I forgave it internally as I was tripping and felt only love for her. \n\nBut I can't help remembering at that deep moment that deep down she was holding back, keeping her heart closed or rather deep down she hasn't fully committed to me. \n\n\n..\n\nAfter that I felt quite bad in the trip, she went off to sit with friends and I felt abandoned. I showed weakness in how much I needed her with me and we talked a lot together that evening, but I felt like I had shared vulnerability and things within myself and she was just having fun, saying there was no meaning to the trip or to life in general, which irked me.\n\n\nHere's my problem. We stopped having sex, while nothing changed for me, every time I'd initiate she would not be in the mood. She says she has no sex drive, while before we could have sex all the time and shed always be really into it. Now she can't even get wet, as far as I know doesn't masturbate. And nothing is turning her on.\n\nShe says she doesn't know why. That I'm attractive to her, she just isn't in the mood and that this has never happened before.\n\nI can't help but think the trip or even smaller one after is to blame. I've always become very sober after a big trip, often not thinking about sex until over a week later but for her it's been 2 cycles already and nothing..\n\n\n\nIt's killing me to have my advances rejected, she used to touch me just for fun and now it's like her hands are off me. I used to be able to touch her but now she views anything other than platonic skin contact as a sexual advance that makes her feel pressured and uncomfortable.\n\n\nShe also says she feels guilty for not giving me sex, and I always reassure her we don't have to, that I don't need it and I can wait, and would rather because it's only good if we're both in the mood.\n\n\nAt this point our relationship works, but I'm deeply worried that we'll never go back to sex again and even if we do it'll be rare, and honestly that's not a relationship I want to stay in... which kills me because what we had before was perfect.\n\n\n\n\nAny advice is appreciated, sorry for the length I had to get it out there.\n\nTL;DR: My partners sex drive completely vanished, I suspect it was a strong trip, she says she doesn't know why, I still can't figure out why or how to fix it.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678044893.0},{"title":"Looking for Bluefluke\u2019s Atom Bomb Tarot","author":"Shadojaq","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11jq8zp\/looking_for_blueflukes_atom_bomb_tarot\/","text":"\nHello all and I hope everyone is well.

The rave was called Illusions so it was a very auditory\/visual experience. I took 3 very weak tabs of acid (~70ug) 3 hours before the party so by the time I got to the party I was peaking. After about 5-6 hours into the trip I dropped 2 nasa pink rockets (~10-15mg each). Everything was so colorful, i felt the music on my skin and I was borderline feral horny.  It was the first time for me getting anything color-wise when taking a psychedelic it\u2019s usually just wavy and melty for me. The closed eye visuals were INSANE.  I\u2019m amazed how good this stuff is and I think I like it even more than MDMA\/XTC. I am completely in love with this substance. It\u2019s just so sad we don\u2019t have it available where I\u2019m from because I feel that if we did have it much less people would end up abusing MD\/XTC and their brains wouldn\u2019t be fried. Just placed an order and I can\u2019t wait for my 2cb HCL to arrive since it\u2019s much cheaper (~1\u20ac per 20mg dose) so I can introduce this amazing magical substance to all my rave buddies. Gonna try it solo without any acid this friday.

Guys can skip over this if you want. \n\nThis month has been rough, I had a migraine off and on which made me extremely lightheaded the entire week.* \n\nI trip to help the migraines and it has significantly. I went from having 3 to 4 a week to having around 3 a month. This particular month has been super busy and didn't get to trip on time at my specific date.\u00a0 I had a little time to trip in the early afternoon. I'm not going to say the amount because either someone going to say that's what they eat for breakfast or that's too much or too little. It's turning into a pissing contest on this sub but whatever. I had Albino PE and Yeti. \n\nI took the shrooms and started drifting off, all of a sudden my body started hurting bad and my anxiety shot throughout the roof. Something was wrong. I took some CBD to bring the anxiety down, it helped a lot. I use my glasses as a grounding tool. Every few minutes I look around the room and felt okay. I took some more CBD and checked in with myself every few minutes to figure out if I needed anything.  For the most part everything was copacetic.\n\nI started walking from room to room in a dream like state, drinking water every few minutes. This was a different trip, challenging but fun. I realized subconsciously I was fighting so badly for control, which I never do during trips. I watch a few videos on challenging trips which also helped a lot. I shifted my mind and laid down to finish the trip. I just melted without thinking about anything. \n\nI learned I have got to listen to my body. I'm exhausted and it's because I have not gotten a day off in 3 weeks. I need a routine because without one I'm just floating through without getting anything done personally. I am one person and the amount of stress on me in my personal life is too much. Everything is a facade; just look at stuff we like until we die. I do need to try harder and stop watching life and participate in it. \n\n*I got my period in the middle of this trip. I'm 100% sure that that's the reason the trip started to go wonky on me. I did not listen to my body when it was showing me the signs because I was too busy with everything else. Your hormones play a role in this in a big way. I'd skip the trip if you are on your period.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678037814.0},{"title":"Ego Fractured At One Gram","author":"TragicallyThrowaway","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11jiu3b\/ego_fractured_at_one_gram\/","text":"I am autistic and ADHD and like many of my neurotype, I like to research the hell out of things I am interested. Recently, that special interest has been psychedelics and I have been researching and speaking with people about all things psychedelic for the past 3 months. Two weeks ago, I finally found a reliable plug and scored myself 1 g of Golden Teachers which I stored in the fridge.\n\nOops! Bad idea. I took them out and they molded. Luckily, one of my friends had a gram of Transkei which she had put within a chocolate. Not wanting to delay my trip further, I ran over to her place, bought her shroom chocolate and took it.\n\nMy setting was my college dorm room. On my monitor played Moving Art, a documentary showcasing the beauty of the natural world. I had two trip sitters, one who was stoned on weed and one who was sober. Colorful lights which I had installed danced in the room. I felt safe and comfortable with a lemon ginger tea.\n\nMy intent was quite complex for my first trip. I wanted to let go of my childhood trauma, to feel at one with the universe, to connect with friends, find inspiration and have fun. By inspiration, I suppose I mean I wanted to find meaning? I find meaning in my current relationships, but as I look for a future career path, I have yet to find something which I feel like I'd like to dedicate my life to and I was hoping I'd have some sort of revelation. I am not taking any medication or similar I think would have impacted my trip.\n\nAround 4pm, I took my gram of mushroom chocolate in my friend's room and took the 10 minute walk back to my place with my trip sitters. At this point, I had not eaten anything for the previous 5 hours, so I decided to eat a banana hearing an anecdotal report that enzymes within the banana aided in digestion of the mushroom and followed it with my lemon ginger tea hoping to soothe the stomach and perhaps help myself come up faster.\n\nAround 40 minutes in, my first effects began to kick in. The colors around me all began to feel especially vivid and beautiful. I became very interested in the nature documentary and felt giggly. I decided to look in a mirror and noticed my pupils were incredibly large and had fun comparing them to my trip sitters. Eventually, I started to feel nauseous and pain in my stomach, so I sat back on the bed and relaxed.\n\nA few minutes later, I decided that the visual stimuli was a bit much, so I decided to close my eyes and was greeted with beautiful patterns. Normally, closing my eyes, I am greeted by visual snow. This snow was still there, but I found it formed itself into geometrical patterns and shapes. At times, it even felt 3 dimensional. The patterns would move according to the music of the documentary and even according to my thoughts. If I thought of a tree, the snow would form into a tree like shape for example. In no way would these shapes be mistaken for actual reality however, it was all very abstract. It almost felt as if there was an indie video game cutscene going on in my head.\n\nSoon after, the episode of the documentary ended. My tripsitters were talking about Formula One which I wasn't particularly interested in, so I asked for my noise cancelling headphones and eye mask and put on a psychedelic therapy playlist. At this point, the psychedelic headspace really began to kick in.\n\nI felt myself engaging in a conversation with my subconscious? It was almost as if thoughts just spewed from my brain without effort which made it feel like the thoughts weren't mine but at the same time, I was well aware that they were my thoughts. They were rapid and often aligned with the music. For example, as the music crescendoed, I felt as if my thought was about to reach an epic conclusion only to lose track of the thought as the music again calmed. Perhaps this was because the questions I asked, for example, how do I find meaning? didn't really have answers.\n\nMany thoughts were more fruitful however. I addressed my childhood trauma and while I didn't really learn anything new per say, I did find it was easier to forgive myself and mean it while under the influence. I was also experiencing a wicked body high and felt a sense of peace and connection with the universe.\n\nAround halfway through the playlist, I decided to take off my headphones and update my friends on the situation but I found it difficult to communicate with them so I eventually put my equipment back on and decided to switch the music to a rock playlist containing Jimi Hendrix and similar prior to tripping. This music felt incredibly banal to me surprisingly since I love it when sober so I switched back to the psychedelic therapy playlist. At this point, I began to really disassociate.\n\nMy body did not feel real. It I opened my eyes, lifted my blindfold and looked at my hands, they did not feel like mine. I realised that the past was meaningless as was the future. I was simply thoughts drifting alone in the universe without any meaning. While I was incredibly at peace with this whilst my eyes were closed and the playlist was on, I felt much more nervous upon opening my eyes. \"Why the hell did I do this?\"\n\nAs interesting and even peaceful as that was, I value my individuality, I value my sense of self, I value my human life! Sure, those in power have made many decisions that I do not believe are in the best interest of humanity, but I am so thankful for society, for life and the forms of human expression that exist. I am happy to be alive!\n\nI still felt disassociated and my visuals were peaking. Particularly in my peripheries, the room was swirling and I was unable to tell where my friend's faces ended and the air began. While some have said that they felt very connected with the external world on shrooms, I did not feel this at all at this point. My friends felt like NPCs, I was convinced I was in a strange dream and I had to find a revelation. I had my friends escort me to the communal bathroom as I told them about my strange experience. Another acquaintance on my floor passed me on this walk. Still feeling that this was not really real, I nonchalantly told him I was on shrooms. I have yet to talk with him after this experience, but knowing him, I think we are chill. At this point, I was very articulate and while the things I was saying were perhaps not topics regular people talk about while walking outside, I doubt he or anyone else would've been able to tell that I was high had I not told him. We were maybe approaching 2 hours after taking the shrooms at this point and by 2 and a half hours, my visuals had essentially gone away, but the headspace remained.\n\nI then decided I wanted to walk outside a bit. The campus where I am located is very green and I thought I would be interested in the nature, but I was not. My sense of self was not back, I felt like my thoughts were purely objective. I analyzed everything and had no emotional attachments to anything. Eventually, I started panicking and worrying that I had fucked up my brain and would never return to normal.\n\nI suspect it was a mix of dumping information on my poor trip sitters and time passing, but I eventually felt my sense of self returning as we went to A&W to get a meal and then returned back to my room for herbal tea, this time, Greek Mountain Tea. At this point, my emotions had pretty much returned and I felt am immense sense of gratitude not only to my trip sitters for helping me through a difficult experience, but to all my friends and family. Some friends called me to check in while I was tripping, and I told them all how much I loved them and am grateful for them.\n\nMy friends then started showing me French and Indian music videos, countries whose art I am not super familiar with. I found myself fascinated with and grateful for the variety of human expression across cultures. I was also fascinated by the bizarre memes my trip sitters showed me. One was a picture of Tom from Tom and Jerry making a strange face captioned \"when you go to knee surgery\". I was so happy that people were finding humor in the most absurd of topics and at the diversity of human expression. I had this beautiful affirmation for all things Earthly.\n\nPerhaps because I felt somewhat detached from myself, I felt very comfortable talking about my trauma. Everything from my childhood to my recent thoughts that perhaps I am more of a woman than a man. It felt good to get this out and I reaffirmed my prior sober revelation that I redirect a lot of my negative emotions at myself rather than having healthy outlets and I hope that this revelation will stick more after my psychedelic experience. My trip sitters also appreciated this and my sharing made them feel comfortable to share some of their darker thoughts. Strangely, I also felt more reaffirmed in my identity as a man. While I certainly value traits that society deems feminine more-so than masculine traits, that does not make me less of man. This may have been the most novel idea I formulated.\n\nI also decided throughout this whole experience that I wanted to take better care of my body, eat healthier food, exercise more and give up weed, currently the only other substance I have been taking. Life is precious.\n\nEventually, I felt I had come down. My visuals had finished long ago, I felt like a person rather than an analytical computer and I went to bed after devouring an entire pizza. So much for health food, but I needed something open late at night with minimal human interaction involved and our dorms do not possess kitchens. I was hungry after my fast.\n\nWaking up, I felt a sense of anxiety. Was their more visual snow than I remember, or am I just anxious? I think I was just hyperaware of the fact that I was fucking around with my brain and there could've been negative consequences, for at breakfast when I was speaking with my friends, the snow faded and was not noticeable nor was it noticeable writing this report until I got to the section pertaining this visual snow.\n\nMy anxiety faded and was replaced with an affirmation for life and desire to reflect further. I feel more thankful for the things that I have from friends to nature to a sense of self and I am hoping that in the long run I will take care of myself and be more forgiving.\n\nIn a way, I would say my psychedelic experience was pointless. I didn't come to any new revelation per say. But it was almost how pointless it was that made it meaningful. Like Captain Ahab, I spent 3 months chasing a White Whale and while I came to a few revelations, I still haven't found a sens de la vie.\n\nThis desire for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world is something that I will have to struggle with, but as I move through my angsty young adult years, I feel one step closer to accepting that and practicing gratitude and mindfulness. I am unsure what my next step will be, but after teetering so close to ego loss, I do not think I will be trying shrooms again without the guidance of a shaman if at all.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678062178.0},{"title":"your thoughts on a relationship with a person that's not spiritual or explored any psychonautic paths yet?","author":"hyperextendedloop","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11jujv6\/your_thoughts_on_a_relationship_with_a_person\/","text":"Greetings fellow travelers. I'm a guy in my mid twenties, on the path for about 6 years now. From a nihilist atheist to a faithful spirit in a body and mind that's no longer controlling me fully by their programming. I am taking conscious decisions daily now and living a challenging but wonderful life. \n\nTL;DR: highschool crush asked me out (both 25 now), conflicted about going or not because of my stored up teen emotions and lust for her, worrying this might cloud my vision. She is now a corporate person, without artsy pursuits but still a warm, loving heart. \n\n\nI've been out of a relationship for close to half a year now and she was who deepened me into spirituality, even though I feel like, in a practical sense I've overtaken her practice. She knows all the theory, but doesn't really apply it through conscious decisions anymore. That's done anyway. We still love each other, are friends and keep sharing our deep perspectives as we both don't quite have spiritual friends and live in secluded areas as well. \n\nHere comes my highschool crush: we were very close friends since 7th grade until after highschool when she got into her first serious relationship and we just drifted away and never talked again, as our lives took different routes. 5-6 years later she texts me and mentions going out, seeing a movie together. We chat for a few hours, mostly vocals and it was lovely hearing her voice and how she progressed and grew as a person since. \n\nI'm really into conserving and channeling my social and sexual energy into my creative works now. From our talks, I can tell she's the same loving soul, in a much more mature woman, but with close to 0 interest and leanings into spirituality. She has a great job corporate job, but no artsy leanings which I don't mind. \n\nJust wondering if anyone's had a relationship with a partner that's not on this path and how it went?\nI feel like I still have a baggage of emotion towards her and if we go out, that might cloud my judgement from my actual feelings. My dormant teenage lust for her, being my crush for so many years will also surely come into play when given the prospect of actually being intimate with her. And I'm just afraid of these circumstances, which seem difficult to manage with an open, spiritual, pure heart. That's why I'm not very eager to just go out and see what's what after the date. \n\nAnd I do not need a partner to be whole, I know. I do no need it, but from the place where I'm at right now, it's something I *want*, instead of *need*. It's something I can offer to someone else as well, being in a peaceful place myself. And it doesn't feel like I'm looking, rather I'm being sought. \n\nI deeply appreciate anyone reading this and any thought or perspective on the situation!!\u2728","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678096681.0},{"title":"I need help understanding what happened","author":"L1CKx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11jjnex\/i_need_help_understanding_what_happened\/","text":"So after a triptoday, I don't think or know if I can meditate again or for a while.

During this period, its subtle body gets food from cosmic energy. Individual souls have different shades in their energetic bodies based on their qualities and deeds done. \n\nThe first world, *Bh\u016b Loka,* is subdivided into four sub-worlds called *Martya* *Loka*, *Preta Loka*, *Naraka Loka* and *Pit\u1e5b Loka*. This earth on which human beings exist is called *Martya* *Loka* or *Karma* *Loka*, which is the first sub-world of the first world, called *Bh\u016b* *Loka*. This first sub-world is the place for doing deeds and hence, it is called a *karma* *loka*. Above this first sub-world, the other three upper sub-worlds of the *Bh\u016b Loka* and the other worlds existing above the *Bh\u016b Loka,* are invisible to human beings due to the unimaginable power of God. **But by the grace of God, some souls can see them.** \n\nWhen the inquiry is over in the *Preta* *Loka*, the individual soul with its subtle body, travels along one of four channels starting from the *Preta* *Loka* which is the junction. The channel along which a soul is sent depends on the inquiry of its deeds and the corresponding fruits that are to be enjoyed by the soul. The *Naraka* *Loka* and the *Pit\u1e5b* *Loka*, which are the two uppermost sub-worlds of *Bh\u016b Loka* lying above the *Preta Loka*, are called *bhoga lokas.* All worlds lying above the *Bh\u016b* *Loka* are also called as *bhoga* *lokas*, which are the places meant for the enjoyment of the fruits of one\u2019s deeds. The four possible channels through which souls are sent after the inquiry in the *Preta* *Loka* are:\n\n1) The third sub-world immediately above the *Preta* *Loka* is called *Naraka* *Loka,* which is hell. All sinners go to this world. Their souls are present in bodies which resemble black smoke. This body of smoke is called as *dh\u016bma* *\u015bar\u012bra*. Note that the \u2018food\u2019 for all energetic bodies is cosmic energy itself. But for the souls in the *dh\u016bma* *\u015bar\u012bras* this \u2018food\u2019 from the cosmic energy, is almost not supplied. The souls constantly suffer from terrible weakness. Very very little cosmic energy and that too very rarely, is supplied to them now and then; just to maintain the very mild energetic bodies. *Naraka* *Loka* (hell) is headed by Yama Dharmar\u0101ja. In the region just above this regular hell, special hells headed by K\u0101labhairava also exist.\n\n2) The uppermost sub-world of *Bh\u016b* *loka* is called *Pit\u1e5b* *loka* to which all neutral souls go. This sub-world is located on the moon. The body of the soul here is made of mild moonlight and is called as a *pit\u1e5b* *\u015bar\u012bra*. Food for these bodies is supplied in the form of the light energy of the moon.\n\n3) The next immediate world above the *Bh\u016b* *loka* is called *Dyu* *loka*. It is also called as *Jyotirloka* or *Bhuvarloka.* Souls who have done social service for fame on this earth, reach this world. In this world, the soul gets a body, which is like a little bright light and is called a *jyoti\u1e25* *\u015bar\u012bra*. Food is supplied to these bodies from the cosmic energy. This world lies is between *Bh\u016b Loka* and the sun.\n\n4) Above this second world, exists the *Suvarloka* or *Svarga Loka* starting from the globe of the sun up to the pole star (Dhruva). It is also commonly called heaven. Souls reaching this world are those who have done good work of social service, which is not for fame. The here gets a body called a *bhoga \u015bar\u012bra*. Food for this body to is supplied from cosmic energy.\n\n**Once a soul attains an energetic body, material food is not at all required by its body.** It is said that the material food given to deserving priests, reaches the departed souls. But this is only an *arthav\u0101da,* which is a lie told for a good purpose. It ensures that even a greedy person performs the death rituals and donates food to deserving receivers. It is very important to ensure that the receiver of our donation during any ritual is deserving of our donation. Donation to the deserving brings merit, while donation to the undeserving incurs sin. \n\nDo not think that the donation of food, clothes and money done to undeserving receivers is a mere waste. Actually, it yields punishment since such donation is sin. The Veda says that a receiver is deserving only if the person possesses the following two things (*\u015arotriyasya ch\u0101k\u0101mahatasya*): \n\ni) Spiritual knowledge of the Veda (or of the holy scripture of one\u2019s particular religion) and\n\nii) The lack of aspiration for receiving anything in return from the donor or performer of the ritual.\n\nThe priest is the principal receiver of the donation of money (*dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101*) offered by the donor. Hence, the priest must explain the spiritual knowledge to the donor and other people assembled so as to improve their devotion. If this is not done, the whole ritual is a sheer waste! If the priest does this divine duty in the service of God without any aspiration in return, God will take care of everything for the priest. \n\n**Money cannot be the solution for everything whereas God\u2019s grace solves all problems.** The merit earned in donating to deserving priests protects the departed soul as well as the performer of the ritual. I am not saying that the ritual should not be performed. **What I say is that the ritual must be performed properly with perfect knowledge of the background (*****J\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 kur\u012bta karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014*****Gita).** **By doing the rituals perfectly, good fruits are attained and the punishment for the sin of doing the rituals wrongly can be avoided.**\n\nFor souls who are on the path of *prav\u1e5btti*, which is the path of worldly justice, we discussed the four channels along which they are sent depending on their good and bad deeds on earth. These four channels are limited to the *Bh\u016bloka*, *Bhuvarloka* and *Suvarloka*. The individual souls after enjoying the good and bad fruits of their deeds in the upper worlds or the sub-worlds of *Bh\u016b* *Loka*, return to earth. **This cyclic rotation always continues in** ***prav\u1e5btti*****. In the path of** ***prav\u1e5btti*****, there is no spiritual knowledge or devotion to God. There is only doing good deeds to serve society and avoiding bad deeds which harm society.** Social service is the highest merit in this field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.universal-spirituality.org\/images\/banner480\\_b3\\_v2o.jpg](https:\/\/www.universal-spirituality.org\/images\/banner480_b3_v2o.jpg)","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678064728.0},{"title":"Woohoo!

Both inert energy and awareness are imaginable and they cannot be the unimaginable God. The work done in transporting information from the senses to the brain is awareness and this work is done by the consumption of inert energy derived from food. Hence, awareness is defined as a specific work-form of inert energy. It is the inert energy that gets transformed into awareness in the functioning nervous system. The specific nature of work into which the inert energy gets transformed, depends on the specific nature of the machine (system) which is the conversion device. Electrical energy is converted into a specific form of work, namely, grinding work in a specific machine called a grinding machine. The same electrical energy is converted into another specific form of work, namely cutting work in another specific machine, called a cutting machine.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara was an Incarnation of God. If you consider His awareness as the non-mediated God, then that awareness is certainly independent of inert energy and a nervous system. It can be called unimaginable awareness or the unimaginable God. Awareness is the common point between the imaginable soul and the unimaginable God. Awareness means knowing itself and knowing things other than it. Based on this one small similarity, if you say that the soul is God, you are neglecting the vast difference that exists between the two. The unimaginable mechanism behind the awareness of God and the omniscience of God, which is unattainable for the soul, makes the claim of oneness between the two invalid. If a beggar says that since he is also a human being like the king, he is also the king, is it meaningful in any way? One cannot neglect the vast difference between the two because of just one similarity.\n\nR\u0101m\u0101nuja took the mediated God (N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a) as the ultimate. Hence, there is similarity between the medium of God and an ordinary human being. Based on this common point, one might be tempted to treat the ordinary human being as being part of God. But even that is not acceptable. The mediated God means that God and the medium have merged with each other to become a single entity. When God merges with the medium (soul and body), the medium also becomes the unimaginable God (***Antarbahi\u015bca\u2026***\u2014Veda). Can pure water be treated to be a part of a solution of sugar in water? If it were so, the pure water would have had a part of the sweetness of the sugar solution. But it does not. So, the soul is not inherently God, either partially or fully. The partial or complete identity with God should neither be desired by a soul nor can be attained by any effort by any soul. Having such a wish or making any effort to fulfill that wish, automatically disqualifies the soul from attaining any state of oneness with God. That state can only be granted by God, whenever God wants to do some divine work through His devotee in this world and give its credit to His devotee.\n\n\\-By Shri Datta Swami\n\nwww.universal-spirituality.org\n\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1678018297.0},{"title":"Am I tripping ?

Does it not leave the devotee ever dissatisfied that it is impossible to know God?\u201d Shri Swami replied as follows.\\]*\n\n\\[Message on Naga Panchami day\\] The actual reason is that the intelligence of the devotee can imagine anything, which has the spatial dimensions (length, breadth and height). Anything, which does not have the spatial dimensions, becomes logically unimaginable. You can test this point by closing your eyes and constantly try to imagine anything, which is not having spatial dimensions. Even the minutest particle that you can imagine must have some least measurable or atleast spatial dimensions, which can be calculated atleast by calculations if not by instruments. Therefore, the problem to understand God lies with the devotee and not with God. ***You have to keep God beyond the space because God is the generating cause of the space.*** You cannot find pot in the lump of mud before the generation of the pot. If you say that the pot exists already in the mud, you cannot say that the pot is generated after the preparation of the pot since the pot already exists in the mud. Therefore, the effect should not be in the cause before its generation. Hence, ***space should not exist in God before its generation.*** It means the original God before the generation of space does not have the characteristics of space, which are the spatial dimensions. This logic inevitably keeps God beyond space and hence, unimaginable.\n\nYou may argue that nothing is impossible for the omnipotent God. All impossibilities called as miracles are possible for God. Therefore, ***the unimaginable God by His unimaginable power or capability can make the devotee to imagine even the unimaginable God***. The answer for this is that God never breaks the general logic to be followed by the souls in Pravritti. Of course, God performs these unimaginable events to establish the concept of unimaginable nature. But, this one point stands as an exception and the ***other miracles are sufficient to establish the existence of unimaginable nature***. For another reason also, you should not say that God is not omnipotent due to incapability of this exception since there is a valid reason for this in the interest of not only the devotee but also God. Such valid reason is: the human being is made of ego, jealousy and negligence over the attained or known things. ***As long as an item is unknown and is not attained, the negligence, ego and jealousy subside.*** The human being always regards the distant item and neglects the item, which is present before the eyes. We can find this human nature by several examples and I can give one or two of these. People worship the statue of the serpent today, the Naga Panchami, with unimaginable devotion since the actual serpent is not seen. When it appears, it is immediately killed! People neglect their parents when they are alive and do not give meals even with one side dish. But after their death, their yearly ceremony is performed with meals containing at least a dozen side dishes! In the case of serpents, the fear for selfish harm is the reason. In the case of parents also, the same fear for the selfish harm is the reason because if the yearly ceremony is not performed, there is a fear that some harm will happen to him. This is the inherent nature and even the angels are not exceptional to this as said in the Gita (*Paroksha Priya ivahi Devaah\u2026*).\n\n***Even in the case of contemporary human incarnation, devotees worship it with lot of devotion for sometime and negligence starts slowly.*** God tested whether the human being makes God an exception to this inherent nature. Such test is the observation of the human incarnation after living with the devotees for sometime. The human being perfectly proved that even God is not an exception to its inherent nature. Even the devotee like Rukmini could not overcome this. She was daily drinking the hot milk and the Lord was normal even after drinking the hot milk. One day Rukmini gave the same hot milk to Radha. When Radha took that milk, the skin of the Lord became red due to heat. The Lord told that this happened since He is in the heart of Radha. The conclusion showed that the Lord was not in the heart of Rukmini. Rukmini asked the Lord for the reason. The Lord told that Radha was staying far and hence, the value of the Lord was maintained by her. ***This proves that anybody staying far away will have value.*** Therefore, God wants to stay far from the devotees by always becoming unimaginable so that the value can be maintained. ***When the value is broken, the Lord will feel more for it.*** He does not want to see the break of His value and feel for it. Hence, ***God avoided this one miracle not only in the interest of the devotee but also in His interest***. The interest of the devotees is that the devotee should not lose the Lord due to such negligence.\n\n===============\n\n\\-By Shri Datta Swami\n\n(Visit our website: www.universal-spirituality.org","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678007985.0},{"title":"IGNORANCE-KNOWLEDGE-MEMORY","author":"unityofreligions","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11izs60\/ignoranceknowledgememory\/","text":"  \n\n**IGNORANCE-KNOWLEDGE-MEMORY**\n\n\\[A devotee asked: Why does God choose only the human form for incarnation? Shri Swami gave the following answer.\\]\n\nGod chooses the human form, which is convenient for communication with the humanity whenever He likes to interact with the humanity. God can enter a statue and speak due to His omnipotence. But, the receivers of the knowledge from the statue are excited with shock so that their minds get blocked. The doubts will not arise in such excited state due to fear in the expression. \n\nThe human beings should be in the ground state so that doubts are freely expressed. Suppose, you approach somebody as the human incarnation. You will get a doubt in no time and start believing that He is a human being only. Now, you will be free to express doubts to Him. The answers come out from the human incarnation. You will think that these answers are given because the preacher is a learned scholar. \n\nBut, you get satisfaction that the answer given is good and it is immaterial whether the preacher is God or learned scholar. You are concerned with the clarification of your doubts only. ***This is the stage of imposing ignorance on you.*** In course of time, the realization in your heart comes by the effect of the extraordinary knowledge of the human incarnation. ***This is the stage of knowledge imposed on you.*** \n\nDue to this, you will get the memory of your first approach in which you believed the preacher as the human incarnation. These three stages, which are ignorance, knowledge and memory, happen due to the will of God only as said in the Gita (*Mattah Smrutih Jnanam Apohanamcha\u2026*). The Lord said in the Gita that the ignorance, knowledge and memory are created by His will only.\n\nThe Veda also says that you will cross the death by ignorance and attain God by knowledge (*Avidyayaa Mrutyum Teertvaa Vidyayaa Amrutam Ashnute\u2026*). Here, death means the ignorance of knowledge due to the doubts. This means that the clarification of doubts takes place with the help of ignorance only. The word ignorance here means the ignorance of human incarnation as God since you are ignoring the human incarnation as God and believe Him as an ordinary human being, who became scholar by learning.\n\nSuch belief is based on the ignorance of the truth that the preacher before you is God. Therefore, this ignorance is helping you to clarify your doubts in free state. After this, when all the doubts are clarified, the knot of the inner ignorance breaks due to the complete realization brought by such unimaginable divine knowledge \u201c*Bhidyate hrudaya grandhih, chidyante sarva samshayaah*\u201d. \n\nThe meaning of the above verse is that knot of your ignorance is broken and all your doubts get cleared by the preaching from God. But, in course of time, again, ignorance comes followed by knowledge. ***After a long time, the realization becomes firm.*** After this, God will test you about the firmness of your realization before giving the final divine fruit of salvation.\n\nArjuna realized that Krishna was God in human form through several occasions. When Krishna started preaching the Gita, Arjuna expressed the doubt about the divinity of Krishna (*Aparam bhavato janma\u2026*) Krishna clarified all the doubts of Arjuna by delivering the divine knowledge, called as the Gita. Even the sage Vyasa recognized Krishna as God and addressed Krishna as God (Bhagvaan) in this context only. In other contexts like doing miracles, Krishna was addressed as Krishna only. Sages and even demons can do miracles. \n\nThe Veda says that the true identity mark of God in human form is only the extraordinary true knowledge. At the end of the Gita, Arjuna believed Krishna as God. The beginning of the Gita shows the ignorance of Arjuna regarding the divinity of the human incarnation and the end of the Gita shows the knowledge of Arjuna to realize the human incarnation as God. But, ***such realization vanished just after eighteen days, when the war was over***. \n\nKrishna asked Arjuna to get down from the chariot before all the soldiers. Arjuna became egoistic to get down from the chariot treating Krishna as ordinary driver. Arjuna was born as a hunter in the next birth. The hunter was born as Swami Vivekananda in the subsequent birth, who could not believe Shri Rama Krishna as the human incarnation. Only in the end, he could realize the truth and got salvation. \n\n***Even Arjuna could realize the truth about human incarnation in the third birth only.*** In such case, what about us, the ordinary human beings? The concept of human incarnation is very simple because you can see and talk with God directly. But, the concept is very difficult to retain the faith on the human incarnation.\n\nThis ***concept of human incarnation is called as Brahma vidya***, which means the knowledge of God. People often speak \u201cIs it as difficult as Brahma vidya?\u201d The whole difficulty is not in the concept of Brahma vidya but is in retaining the faith in Brahma vidya.","upvote_ratio":0.45,"created_utc":1678030236.0},{"title":"Friend and I did shrooms but he claims he didnt feel anything.

All of my previous adventures were accompanied with people. This was my first solo trip on any psychedelic. However, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve become a Goddess while tripping.\n\nDealing with some depression, I had a late start to the day and ate eggs, bacon and potatoes along with having a Mimosa. I wasn\u2019t aware I was going to take a trip until later.\n\nThis was a spontaneous solo dose, I had my husband with me and later my brother for any support but I was the only one to trip. Aside from a little sparkling wine from earlier in the day, I was unmedicated going into this event.\n\nMy husband was the greatest while assisting my come up. After I ate the mushrooms, we laid down together in bed and listened to a meditation about healing and forgiveness. I needed this trip to be a healing process so it was important for both of us to put that intent into the world. He caressed my body and I kept my eyes closed listening to the voice and focusing on my breathing. There was a moment where my husbands rhythm of breath matched by own and I swear our hearts were beating in a melody. As I started to feel the effects of the mushrooms, my clothes came off and my sexual climax was met with a magical euphoria. I felt like I was in utter bliss and at this point I knew the trip had just begun.\n\nThe decor in my room played a large part in my trip so I\u2019d like to take a moment and paint a picture. Our room is all neutral colors, a lot of shades of white with hints of tan and beige. I love boho decor so a couple macrame items hang around, brown wooden furniture plus we also cover our TV and mirror with lace and cotton linens (we see these things as portals and want to keep bad energies out and good energies in). We have a heated lamp that gave the whole room this sort of sunshine glow and a ray of heat. Along with lots of plants. The first visuals I had were of the plants dancing with the lights and shadows of the room while all vibrating together.\n\nI laid with my husband for an unsure amount of time, we held each other naked and he caressed me as I told him about my thoughts and feelings in that moment. I looked up at him and he reminded me an Egyptian cat, almost pharaoh looking. The meditation music was still playing and I thought it was just me hearing it but my husband confirmed that it was real. A lot of laughter was shared but I started to feel an overwhelming urge to cry as I talked of my recent depressive struggles. My husband could tell I was becoming emotional. I dismissed him to leave me alone and tend to human matters. I tried really hard to push my emotions aside like I\u2019m so used to in my day to day life but something within me told me to let go and so I did, I bawled. I cried for myself and felt a feminine presence comforting me. I remember trying to search for answers to my problems and my future but I didn\u2019t get any. However, I did receive a sense of peace. I felt this feeling of \u2018it\u2019s okay\u2019 and imagined different versions of my life in the future, I saw different reality tunnels of what could be and within them both I was able to find happiness and see the positive to either outcome.\n\nBackstory: My husband and I recently had to terminate a pregnancy. It was incredibly difficult and traumatic. Emotionally I\u2019ve been struggling really hard and since the operation, I\u2019ve been dealing with a variety of complications with my reproductive organs such as cysts on my ovaries and polyps in my uterus along with unknown fluid in my abdomen. This all has me incredibly fearful about my ability to have a child.\n\nAfter I shed my tears, I was able to melt into my bed and disappear into the whimsical void that called to me. Everything around me just faded away and it was as if I was floating in a warm abyss.\n\nI started to time travel. I found myself amongst friendly companions in the 70\u2019s, bright colors of yellows and oranges surrounding me. I went all the way back to Ancient Rome, white buildings with light florals and gold accents on everyone. I felt like a Greek Goddess, I felt worshipped. Even within the moments where I was physically alone to trip, there was never a time that I actually felt it. There was always this feminine energy surrounding me that was full of love and wonder.\n\nWhen I would get up to use the bathroom, the walls around me would be outlined with rainbow hues. Prisms danced around each other in different directions on the walls. Every object vibrated and danced. The intricate lace fabric on my mirror looked like iridescent snake skin as it shimmered. My ceiling looked like warm rainbow clouds and my bed felt like a cloud that I could sink into. The room would fall around me but it wasn\u2019t terrifying, it was peaceful like a cuddle.\n\nI called my husband back into the room with me and told him that I felt like a Goddess, he told me that he would feed me like the Goddess I am. He returned with some juicy cherries. Now, each cherry that I ate was an intense experience in itself. It felt like a rollercoaster ride and it\u2019s hard to explain why. I would break into laughter as I bit into the cherry, the juice filling my mouth with its sweetness. It was almost orgasmic and I turned to my husband and told him that I felt like I was cheating on him.\n\n**(NSFW ahead)** \u2014 *This led to me going down on him which was transcendental. I could feel our souls connecting, there was this rotating feeling of dominance and power to submission and vulnerability. These two polar opposite feelings were bouncing between us like ping pong. It felt like our bodies were swapping souls in a consistent rhythm. I was him and he was me and we were one. We spent a hot moment trying a variety of sexual positions but I was having a hard time reaching a climax from being so high, or so I thought. Everything felt amazing and I kept getting lost in the sex. I couldn\u2019t tell if I was not orgasming or if I was having multiple orgasms. It was overpowering at times, I felt like the room and my husband was all sinking into me like I was a singularity. Like I was just engulfing everything around me and even myself into this other worldly dimension of pleasure and peace. Eventually I excused my husband and decided to just please myself for a bit to see if I was experiencing orgasms and indeed I was, I could\u2019ve made love to myself for the rest of the night but I decided it was time to explore my high a little bit more.* **(NSFW ends)**\n\nMy husband and I had a safe word for this endeavor which was \u2018Kansas\u2019 and so whenever things got overwhelming, I just yelled the safe word and he would come running to my rescue. Putting on clothes was one of those overwhelming things, the holes in my shirt felt larger than they actually were and it felt like they were multiplying, I couldn\u2019t figure out where to put my head or my arms for the life of me. He helped me dress and at this time I finally left my bedroom after being in there for the last four hours and went to the living room.\n\nThe living room felt like I was going into a completely different world, we turned all the lights down and put on a night sky projector with some chill EDM music. I danced around my living room in the lights from the projector feeling like I was a dancer on stage, the energy and happiness I had and felt was something unreal and that I haven\u2019t had in months. My husband joined and twirled me around. There was even a moment where I felt an urge to do yoga. My mind was so disconnected and my body was free to match the music with each pose. I imagined I was releasing stress and negative emotions from each tense area around my body as I moved about.\n\nOnce my brother got home, we went for a drive and smoked a joint. I was ecstatic to see my brother, my love for him was overwhelming and I couldn\u2019t wait to explore another dimension: the outside world. My husband stayed completely sober. I felt like I was in a video game as we drifted around the turns in the dark. By this point of my trip, I was starting to come down unfortunately and was hoping the weed would push me back up there but it didn\u2019t really do much. Once we got home, my visuals were still strong but the euphoric feeling definitely died down a lot. We turned on Moving Art from Netflix. I still would have a couple random spurts of laughter after taking some hits of nitrous. Around midnight, my husband and I went to lay down in bed and I closed my eyes as I listened to the same meditation that I started my trip with and fell asleep as it all came to an end.\n\nI woke up feeling refreshed, a slight headache from being so stimulated. My energy level did feel drained but my depression felt like it was mostly dissipated. Overall, I felt like a new being. I had confidence in place of my insecurities and happiness in place of sadness. I can safely say, it was a great experience and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone else who may need a remedy to treat a depressive episode. I believe that being the only one to trip and having my husband as my trip sitter truly allowed for me to let go and enjoy myself without worry about anyone or anything else. Like I mentioned, first time I did a solo trip and I certainly can\u2019t wait to do it again but after watching me, my husband wants the opportunity to swap and have the experience for himself at a higher dose. My next solo dose will be a higher dose as well. I feel very open minded from this experience and I can\u2019t wait to explore more.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677983733.0},{"title":"Am I the only who loves the version of myself on acid\/ psychedelics?","author":"manbearpigpwn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11hubip\/am_i_the_only_who_loves_the_version_of_myself_on\/","text":"I\u2019m currently on my 8th acid trip and I\u2019ve come to realize I love the person i am while on acid.

For some context I am not super duper familiar with  psychodelics and I only did proper psychodelics only four or five times  in my life on extremely low doses (first one was a single pill of 2cb  not super strong and the rest is either mdma or 75-100ug of acid).  Whatever on Thursday I was at the verge of dropping out, I was feeling  like I lost all hope towards my studies, work and abilities to do  anything useful in life. A super close friend of mine popped into my  room around 10.30PM and told me he has pretty big tabs of acid if I  wanna give it a go and maybe just go on a bike ride around Glasgow. I  accepted the offer, we dropped a single tab each(According to our dealer  they were 250 each I cant really know but it was stronger than anything  I have ever tried so far). We went on a nice walk in the Kelvingrove  park and smoked some cigarettes ate some gummies. It was all fun till  1AM. IDIOTICLY WE DECIDED TO TAKE TWO MORE TABS FROM OUR DEALER CUZ THE  TRIP WAS AMAZING AND I WANTED TO SEE MORE. So in total we dropped 750ug  each... We rented some electric bikes and started touring the canal and  more which was one until I started realising how dangerous and fast I  was driving(I know it was irresponsible but I felt like it was the best  thing to do at that time). And after couple of minutes I was a wrecked  car on the sidewalk. It was an expensive car as well and I started to  freak out thinking I was massive and the street was really small and I  wrecked that car. Thats when I stopped biking and got into a state of  shock where I wasnt able to see anything other than a massive snakes and  rats surrounding me. Thanks to my friend who kept his calm and was way  more experienced than I am he calmed me down and I experienced my first  actual big ego death. It was an experience I had to go through to be  able to appreciate art and encourage myself to read, create and learn  more. If I am writing this right now its thanks to the things I learned  during that unpleasant experience... After that we biked more around the  park and I was seeing the best sceneries I have ever seen in my life,  it felt like the French country side, I was seeing happy animals and  everything. Then we decided to head back to my room. While we were back  in my room my student accommodation started making room inspections due  to a students weed smell claim from my room. I had 30 grams on me at  that time which was the most idiotic thing I have ever done, I got shit  scared and started panicing cuz I was about to get kicked out from the  university, loose my visa, loose everything I have worked for so far.  Since my friend wasnt living in my room or affiliated with anything he  said he will take care of the weed situation. When the inspectors came  in we pretended that we were in the middle of sex and I will let them  come in within an hour. My dude cleaned my room to the best state ever  under 10 mins and took the weed stash, massive home made bong and the  all other incriminating things. Putted in his bag and started running  away. I perfumed my room and started watching out from the window while  thinking how many stupid situations I got myself into just because of  weed and started to realise that I was actually smoking around 4-5  blunts nearly every night and I was actually becoming addicted to the  stuff. While I was thinking about that my friend whistled from outside  and said you owe me a dinner cunt while binning his bag, my bong and the  stuff. It was a scene to see...\n\nWhatever,  it was around 4 PM that I started to try sleeping cuz I was awake for a  while at that point and couple of mates who were unaware of the acid  situation called me and said I promised to meet them in the pub a while  ago and asked me where the hell I was. I explained the situation and  they came to my room to help me out so we could go to the pub. In the  pub I have realised after a long time that I wasn't actually alone or  stranded in a foreign country by myself... I have met with actually  amazing people and how much I actually relied on them to function  normally. They werent judging and I always kept my ego as my guard  towards them and tried to find holes within their acts. Which got me  into my second massive revelation that I always tried to kill the moment  I was living in with just finding the worst thing to focus on within  that moment. They helped me to go back to my room, communicate with  people normally and made me feel welcome... We had pizza after the whole  thing and watched \"In the night garden\" which helped me to sleep like I  have never slept before. As FOUR GROWN UP MAN who are in their early  20s we all slept together in the same bed hugging eachother. None of  them were on acid or high, they only had two or three pints... They  didnt acted judging or with bad intentions towards me. All of us were  just trying to have fun and life the best life possible.\n\nAfter  my trip, I stopped smoking cigarettes after 8 years of smoking at least  a pack a day which was going upto 2-3... I stopped relying on weed to  just sleep or have fun and I feel like I finally overcame my problem of  not being able to grow out from my shell of the 14 year old Turkish boy.\n\nTLDR: I took 750ug which changed my life for good. At least thats what I hope lol.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677978699.0},{"title":"Detailed Trip Report: Playing With the Divine Feminine (high dose mushrooms)","author":"Top-Requirement-2102","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11i1dpj\/detailed_trip_report_playing_with_the_divine\/","text":" I came back a week ago from my second experience taking mushrooms.  I took a strong dose along with eight other men in the presence of a Shaman and two facilitators.  I had a profound, life-changing experience interacting with the divine feminine.  I will relate most of the details and learning here for the benefit of the community.    \n\nA little about myself:  I\u2019m a healthy male in my fifties, married with children, employed as a software developer.  I have ADHD and have sought help from psychedelics as part of treatment for PTSD, anxiety, and depression.  I have an extensive religious background (LDS, still practicing) and I consume almost no drugs at all.  Last year was my first experience with so-called recreational drugs in the form of psychedelics.  (reported[ here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/sme1v5\/my_first_trip_on_mushrooms_100_times_beyond_what\/))\n\n**Preparation**\n\nSafety and success are important to me.  There are several known practices that led to the positive experience depicted here \u2013 practices that I have seen ignored by others with predictable results.  These are common to many practitioners who help with psychedelic medicine.   I add my own voice of experience in recommending the following:\n\n1. Mental Preparation \u2013   Just like any other medical substance, psilocybin is a powerful tool you want to use deliberately and expertly to make the most of it.   Personally, I made it a matter of careful thought, noticed it calling to me, and did an internal search to try and understand what I wanted  to receive.  The medicine tends to give something along the lines of what the person has been wanting and preparing for, but it will come in an unexpected form, so I also practiced the thought of saying \u201cyes\u201d, to whatever the medicine would give me.    (Even if you are not a spiritual person, it is important to understand that psychedelics work by suppressing the part of the brain called the[ default mode network](https:\/\/psychedelicstoday.com\/2020\/02\/04\/psychedelics-and-the-default-mode-network\/) (DMN). With the DMN suppressed, parts of the brain normally hushed by the DMN become active.   Mental preparation makes it easier to receive the symbolic messages arising from these parts.)\n2. Set and Setting \u2013 Where and how you take the medicine is scientifically shown to affect the result.   A person needs to be in a private, peaceful place where they will not be threatened or distracted, and where bodily needs can be met.   Behavior may change significantly \u2013 I made a lot of noise and did plenty of moving, even dancing, and I was also aware that others in my group were in the room observing.  Feeling comfortable with the people and the room allowed me more freedom of expression.\n3. A competent facilitator -  I knew I was going to be mentally and physically vulnerable for several hours.  It is very important to have a sober person sit with me the entire time and they should have some training to know what to do when things get difficult (and they can get VERY difficult!).  Of course, the facilitator should also know how to administer the medicine so that I get the appropriate dose to help me meet my intention.  There are plenty of people who advocate solo journeys, and they might have a point, and still I think it would be foolish to attempt one without some guided experience first.\n4. Journalling \u2013 I became a careful observer of my life.  Once I decided to take psychedelics with intent,  I noticed my mind adjusting in a subconscious preparation for the experience.  Things happened at work, old memories came up, strange dreams came to me, etc..  I wrote these things down and talked about them with trusted people.    I think of it like preparing to go to Disneyland, where the thoughts that come up are the extra things such as comfortable shoes, sunscreen, water bottles, tickets, etc. that I  will need to maximize the experience.\n5. Integration \u2013  This will come afterwords, but worth mentioning here.  Processing the experience, bringing new ideas into my daily thoughts, and changing my daily practice is what it meant by integration.  It is just as important as the experience itself.  I prepared for this by making sure I had a person (my therapist) who is trained in integration and is ready to help me integrate afterwards. \n\nOther things I did to prepare:\n\n* [Vipassana Meditation](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/balance\/what-is-vipassana-meditation) \u2013 Any kind of meditation is going to help you.  I liked Vipassana because it is administered as a 10-day isolated retreat, free of charge.   Many important ideas came to me here that helped during my psilocybin retreat. \n* [Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy](https:\/\/ifs-institute.com\/) \u2013 Again, any kind of therapy is going to help, however I think IFS is particularly valuable because it teaches how to talk to my internal parts.   It is evidence-based as well, so woo-sensitive people can feel confident with it.   Whatever therapist you have, it\u2019s a good idea to ask them if they are willing to help you integrate your psychedelic experience.  My therapist is [Zakia Ovington](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/therapists\/zakia-ovington-seattle-wa\/901512) and she is amazing!  \n* Taking time off \u2013 I took a few months of medical leave before and also some days off around the retreat to be able to focus on my mental health.  I think this had a strong indirect benefit for me.\n\nAll told, I spent a year building up to this specific trip and my preparation paid off more than I could have imagined. \n\n**The Setup**\n\nThe psilocybin medicine was administered as part of a men\u2019s retreat offered by[ Sacred Heart Medicine](https:\/\/www.sacredheartmedicine.us\/) of Vancouver, WA.   The retreat lasted from a Friday evening to a Sunday morning and took place in a large home where we stayed the entire time, eating and sleeping there as well.   There were 11 of us there in total \u2013Nadia (the Shaman\/administrator), two other helpers (a woman and a man), and eight male participants including myself.   The overall purpose of the retreat was to help heal the psychic wounds men receive growing up and to develop a better understanding of the sacred masculine and feminine. \n\nThe structure of the retreat was the following:  \n\n\n* Friday evening\n   * Introductory ceremony \u2013 some light training is given along with a small amount of mushrooms (a little less than one gram) as an introduction to the medicine.\n* Saturday\n   * Breakfast and casual conversation -  participants talk about the previous ceremony and prepare for the day.  Intentions are developed and\/or refined.\n   * Full Ceremony.  Everyone lies down or reclines in the same room on comfortable cushions and mats to receive and experience the medicine (a higher dose, adjusted to the needs of the person).   This lasts about four hours but can be longer (as in my case).  Facilitators, as needed, will burn incense, help people to the bathroom, give food, help with pillows and blankets, place their hands on the feet of participants, or talk to participants to help them feel comforted and safe.\n   * Celebratory dinner.   Eat together and talk about what just happened.  The medicine is still working during dinner, but the effects are more subdued.\n* Sunday\n   * Wind-up ceremony.   We get together to give our little summaries of what happened, and the facilitators give notes on what they say.\n\n**My Experience**\n\nWhat follows is a lengthy account of going through this process with these medicines.  The details of the ceremony itself are sacred, so out of respect I am leaving them out and I will focus on my own observations.  My aim is not to interpret the experience, but to describe it as accurately and honestly as I am able.  This is difficult because all senses undergo fluid distortion, especially the sense of time and order of things, however the memories during a psilocybin session are quite distinct, and a lot can be recalled, especially when there is a friend to help corroborate what happened and when I take notes as soon afterward as possible. \n\nFriday\u2019s session was an introductory session that was interesting and helpful, but by far the most powerful sensations and insights came from the Saturday session with its higher dose.   The entire weekend was Earth-moving for me, experiencing what felt like five years\u2019 worth in introspection in just a couple of days.  I hope you enjoy my accounting as I take you along for my personal adventure of healing and discovery.\n\n**Introductory session, Friday** \n\nThe introductory ceremony on Friday began in the large living room of the house.  All the furniture had been cleared out and replaced with yoga mats and floor chairs.  We brought in extra pillows and blankets to help make ourselves comfortable.  Nadia sat near the fireplace which was appropriately decorated with a tree of life motif.   She gave us some instructions on three meditations that we would do.   After the instructions, we drank a cup of mushroom tea.   The flavor was muted and earthy \u2013 quite easy to consume.  We then lay down or reclined to get comfortable while Nadia played some fast paced rhythmic drumming. \n\nThe details of this session were largely personal, and from a relatively shallow psychedelic space, so I\u2019ll leave most of those out.  Most of us did experience some visuals for about 30-40 minutes.  I saw the rainbow colors and geometric patterns often associated with psychedelic visions.  My ego was mostly intact, though I could sense it holding on, dangling, like that little guy on google maps when choosing a street view.   With the ego distracted, another strong aspect of my personality came up \u2013 an aspect I call \u201cRafiki\u201d, left over from my previous trip a year ago.   \n\nThe overall experience was quite subdued, which I think is the point.  Nevertheless, I had several insights worth writing down. We went to bed soon afterwards to get a good sleep for the next day.   I took a few  pages of notes before turning in.\n\n**Breakthrough Session, Saturday** \n\nI spent a pleasant morning eating and hanging out with the others.  While walking around the kitchen area, we all would curiously visit the tall, stainless steel pot sitting prominently on the stove.  Suspended in a strainer at the top of the full pot, steeping in the hot water, was a quantity of mushrooms & herbs.   As if in anticipation of the colors I would soon witness, the mixture exhibited beautiful purples, pinks, and greens.   I had a sense of great promise for what was to come. \n\nDuring this time, we were asked to refine an intention for the afternoon, to think about what we want to let go of.  I felt the idea come to me to let go of everything, to simply let myself die with regard to all prospects, relationships, and projects, to let go of my life even.  I\u2019ve known for a long time that I wanted a deeper experience, and I felt determined to go all the way, so I set aside everything I could think of setting aside.  I had read in the book[ How to Change your Mind](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Change-Your-Mind-Consciousness-Transcendence\/dp\/0735224153) that being willing to go through whatever the medicine presents is an important part of reaping all the benefits.  Dying seemed the most extreme, so I prepared by deciding I was ready to die. \n\nThe session began as we gathered back in the living room at 11:00am.   Nadia again explained what would happen and gave additional instructions on how to approach the ceremony.   She then administered Sananga,  a yellowish liquid used in traditional Amazonian medicine to sharpen night vision.    We are all given the choice to refuse it if we want, but everyone participates.  When it is my turn, I tilt my head back so that the liquid can be applied to my closed eyes, then I blink it in.  The sting is intense, like a needle in the eye- it took my breath away and I had to be reminded to breathe and allow the pain.  It lasted just a few minutes, and though it was intense, it was not intolerable.   As for the effects, I did notice sharper physical vision later, though hard to distinguish from the effects of psilocybin.\n\nNext we received a tobacco snuff called *Rape\u2019* (pronounce hah-peh)*.*   Again, people could turn this down, but nobody did.   It was administered one nostril at a time.   When Nadia reached me, she asked me to hold my breath,  then she placed an artistically carved pipe into a nostril and gave a tiny puff, shooting the snuff far back into my nose.   People have different sensitivities to this medicine, some almost no reaction, but to me it felt like cayenne pepper being blown into my nose, through my eye, and onto the back of my skull!  The feeling was intense!  I had to sit back a minute to let it wash over me before I could receive it in the next nostril.  The Rape\u2019 has the effect of bringing me into my body, focusing on the sensations.  It also gave me a strong emotional release.  I thought about my parents, both dead for a number of years, and I mourned them, letting the tears roll down into the bucket I was holding.  We all sit with that medicine for several minutes, refraining from blowing our noses and spitting occasionally into our buckets so as not to swallow the furious drainage that is tinged with snuff and tastes of earth and ash. \n\nAfter receiving the introductory medicine, we share our intentions with the rest of the group.   Around noon the mushroom medicine is administered.  We put masks over our eyes and layed down or reclined to get comfortable.  Nadia put on some very gentle background music that stayed on throughout the whole day and evening.   It takes longer for the effects to begin this time.  It\u2019s not until right after the third cup and eating some mushrooms that the familiarity of a strong psychedelic vision returns to me.\n\n**The Onset**\n\nThe first phase of the journey is what I call the onset.  It begins with a feeling of euphoria, and my first instinct is to laugh.   I feel as though I am a child walking into Disneyland for the first time, or having just received my first bike for Christmas, excited and ready to ride.\n\nThe visuals commence slowly at first with glimmers, shifts, and patterns here and there, building quickly into intense rainbow colors with wildly repeating geometries.  (The appearance is similar to the images[ here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZqvhJhi8CF4?t=3592). )  I am still aware of my ego and as I think about my intent of dying \u2013 the visuals become veneered with a black surface, as if decorated for a funeral.\n\nAfter a time (who can say how long?) these visuals into an  introduction to God.  I experienced this for a short time in my session a year ago, however this time it is much longer and God presents as a distinctly female presence, and has the form of a vast living thing like a cosmic whale with fractal edges swimming gracefully in a vivid blue sea.  The overriding feeling from this being is love.  Love mixed with powerful intelligence fully directed toward me.   After experiencing this for some time, I return to my intention and head down into darkness, but she pulls me back and I can feel her tell me,  \u201cYou are not here to die, you are here to live\u201d  The black all around me breaks apart and I am soon back in the vibrant color space.\n\nSomewhere about this time, I am aware of an entity I first experienced a year ago that I called Rafiki.   He is serpent-like, red-orange in color, with a vaguely cubic form.  He has many eyes and his presence is powerful and masculine.   He comes into my mind and I become him.  My manner of speaking changes completely \u2013 a deep accented voice that speaks slowly and with great confidence.   I speak as him out loud.  Everyone can hear me.  In a friendly way, Nadia shushes me.  Rafiki is incredulous at being shushed, however he is respectful of Nadia and  though he continues to speak, it is  in a hushed town. \n\nAt this point my ego, my human self, is virtually absent.   It is just Rafiki and another presence that Rafiki is talking to.  Gradually my awareness moves back into the room, but it is much more perceptive, more profound.   I realize the other voice is the sacred feminine being I had witnessed as God before.   There is a lot of banter going back and forth between her and Rafiki.   This is the beginning of what turns into literally hours of play between the two.   As love pours in from the feminine, Rafiki rapidly relaxes, pacifies, and becomes like a playful child, no longer powerful and intimidating, but curious and excitable.   The whole time, Rafiki stays grounded in my body, but the feminine appears everywhere \u2013 especially in other people, but also in objects, in the music playing, and in the mind. \n\n*A few items to mention at this juncture:*\n\n1. *I want to stress that the sense that these beings actually exist is undeniable.  The perception of them has far more reality to it than a dream, and even more weight than the ordinary waking experience.   Even afterwards as I write this, when the rational thought patterns of the mind have returned, there remains the realization that one can never go back to thinking the old ways- it was all too real to think otherwise.   I can\u2019t fully access these perceptions in writing this, but I have clear memories of the whole day and the spike of intensity I felt in recognizing what I would call God.*  \n2. *Curiously, I don\u2019t find the facts of what I saw in conflict with my religious belief even though they differ significantly from very specific dogmas about the form and appearance of God.   The sense of God in the vision is simply so encompassing that the god of my religion fits inside of it like a single person in a huge stadium.* \n\n**The interplay between masculine and feminine**\n\nThe way that the feminine played around and around with Rafiki was an important, ubiquitous, and delightful part of the whole experience.  So much so that I have decided to devote an entire section to it. The \u201cplay time\u201d totalled around 7 hours, with aspects of the play remaining with me a full week later.  Given that personalities I discovered in my experience last year still remain with me, I expect to retain this feminine aspect indefinitely\n\nFirst, I will describe the two personalities:\n\n* Feminine personality \u2013 composed of, and radiating pure, focused, unwavering love not all that different from how we experience sunshine.  She is constantly changing forms and is found everywhere in every form.   She never forces anything, but accomplishes work through subtlety born out of a vast wisdom and intelligence.  She easily moves back and forth between the most sincere compassion possible and the most clever jokes that defy the mind.   She does not really speak, but the world she creates through her form will give her words.  She is madly in love with the divine masculine. I never had the thought to give her a name, as I did with Rafiki.  It felt like a name wasn\u2019t needed or wouldn\u2019t stick.\n* Masculine personality \u2013 A serpent in form, I call him Rafiki.   He is impetuous, explorative, and contrary like a child.  He is constantly pushing rules and boundaries, occasionally pushing too far.  He likes to talk.  He resists the feminine but also loves her madly and respects her profoundly.   He will burst into laughter at the feminine\u2019s clever jokes.   He is constantly flummoxed by her astounding multi-level tricks and diversions that get him to do the most wonderful and productive things, resulting frequently in this gleeful surrender and confession:  \u201cOK!  You win!  You can love me.   I admit it, you are the MOST INTELLIGENT being in the universe, and that is what I love about you.\u201d He says that last part with mock sarcasm of a person that is overcome with the unfettered, shameless love received from another he admires that is far more vast and capable, but also fully focused and purposed on him with unreserved, authentic purity.   There is literally nothing else to do but stop fighting and let her love him and fill him with the most wholesome adoration there ever was or will be. \n\nIn the beginning of their play, the conversation was presented like two young lovers sneaking out in disguises, sharing a secret joke on the world.  \u201cHeehee, nobody knows it is Us!\u201d   I say lovers because that is the twitterpational quality of the intellectual\/emotional interaction, but it isn\u2019t sexual - just pure love.   The two lovers circle around and around each other, the serpent playfully trying to resist and escape, to outmaneuver the feminine, but she is like a thousand steps ahead of him and he meets her loving gaze at every turn.   \n\nThe play gradually expands and becomes less covert.   On the first expansion, the role of the feminine moves out of my mind and into the friend next to me (I will call him Felix to protect his identity \u2013 he is a friend of mine that decided to attend with me.) When I look at Felix, I see this feminine personality in his face.   I know it is Her.   Felix has joined in this play, and allows the feminine to speak through him.  \n\nLater, as the need to be quiet and non-disruptive winds down, we have more freedom to act out this playful cycle openly and joyfully, speaking loudly and laughing more.   People hear and observe us and just shake their heads with a smile.  I am constantly moving through all emotions and feeling loved the whole time.   It\u2019s indescribably amazing and I will always cherish the memory of it. \n\nA little example of this play:  at one point I am trying to make it to the kitchen and I have to get down on my knees because I\u2019m wobbly.   She says, \u201cDid I pull the rug out from under you?\u201d  I look down and see that I\u2019m on a rug.  That\u2019s a joke, so I laugh, but then I notice there are geometric patterns on the rug, and from my visions I see that the patterns are depictions of her face.   Thinking about all the forward planning that must have happened for her to make that particular joke in that moment, I say,  \u201cYou even put your face on the rug!   HOW do you DO that??\u201d  Then Rafiki bursts out laughing and confess how smart the Goddess is and how much he loves her. \n\nLater in the evening, the play expands much further into other people and objects.  It is clear and obvious to me that every person (including myself) and every single thing are all God, the same being, individually and collectively.   It is a oneness like I have never sensed or comprehended before.  The play continues, but the feminine is now speaking through the whole environment \u2013 other people in the room, the crowd of people eating dinner in the kitchen, the music, the sounds, the objects, the house itself.    It was a dizzying, profound lesson being impressed onto my mind in a thousand different ways.   \n\nIt was spectacular to have a conversation with God and have God\u2019s part of the conversation move continuously so that it emanated from wherever I placed my attention.  One second I\u2019m talking to a person, next second the snippets of conversation from another room are continuing the sentence, then the music and random noises are speaking to me, then everything comes together in a symphonic conversation with many parts, but all communicating a single message to me.  These words I am writing now are a truly pathetic effort to describe it all.  It is something that must be experienced to truly understand it.\n\n**Purging, release, and forgiveness**\n\nAnother important aspect of the evening was a set of important mental and emotional breakthroughs, deep moments of realization that allowed me to release pain and injuries, some that have been with me nearly my entire life.   These releases gutted me emotionally and I often wept full force, sobbing uncontrollably, followed by the peaceful relaxation of being freed from a burden. \n\nThe nature of psilocybin is to suppress the ego, the part of my personality that would normally hide and bind up the painful experiences of my life.   My ego is also concerned about politeness and proper conversation.   Under the influence of the medicine, there is no holding anything back.   I say it like it is, I don\u2019t soften my tone or my language, I just don\u2019t care about appearance or what other people think about me.   On top of that, I see that everyone is me, we are all god, so what\u2019s the point in holding back?   It is honoring the love I am receiving to be honest about what is in my mind.  (Other people are honest with me too - one person admitted he found me irritating at first, but then later felt nothing but love for me.)  \n\nOther people, especially Nadia with her powerful feminine energy, were crucial to helping me through these realizations.  Their training on how the process works allowed them to receive my unusual behavior and visions and turn those lovingly back onto me for processing.  Instead of interpreting for me, they were \u201ckeeping the container\u201d as they called it, bouncing the energy back in so I could handle it.   They would repeat back what I was saying, and ask questions such as \u201cAnd what do you think that means?\u201d   \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d  \u201cHow does this make you feel?\u201d  \u201cWhere are those feelings coming from?\u201d etc.   They would also reassure me with words like \u201cIt takes time.\u201d  \u201cYou are perfect.\u201d  \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d   \u201cYour experience was exactly what was needed.\u201d  \u201cRelax and let it happen.\u201d \u201cYou are working through this so well\u201d  \u201cYou have made some powerful breakthroughs.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s OK to feel that way.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d \n\nThe many specific breakthroughs I had were often deeply personal, so I will mostly speak in generalities here to give you a sense of what was happening for me:\n\n* I was able to see my father\u2019s experience of me from a first person perspective.  This allowed me to reach him and my feelings about him in a way that allowed me to forgive and release, because I was forgiving myself.\n* I could objectively view my personality from the outside and see it how God sees it, with perfect acceptance.   The feminine, speaking through Felix, would often tell me, \u201cyou are perfect!\u201d  or gently hold me back with \u201cIt\u2019s OK.  Slow down. Don\u2019t disturb the picture.\u201d   This is coaching at its most loving.   It is perfect and with it, it is impossible to feel ashamed of myself.   I can see how the aspects of me I don\u2019t like need to be there, and how they also need some loving containment.\n* I learned new ways to see my wife and my work, allowing me to reframe them as divine and part of this eternal play between masculine and feminine.  This is a totally new way of seeing every aspect of my life \u2013 just part of this bigger, wonderful dance.\n* I observed the universe as infinitely synchronous.  Part of the feminine play and cleverness is the leverage of endlessly wide and deep repeating patterns.  The patterns were detected by all of my thoughts and senses.  It is something easy to see in the vision state and harder to see in the mortal ground state, however I realize later as I write that I can look for it and find it if I am patient and persistent.  I can also derive happiness from these little reminders in that I can sense the delightful play that is always happening.\n* Seeing myself in the mirror was a revelation.   At one point I had to go to the bathroom, and when I saw myself in the mirror, I looked right into my eyes and I saw the same receptive feminine spirit that had been loving me all evening.  I also saw Rafiki looking back, and also my own mortal self.    I viewed myself with exquisite clarity and detail and it was obvious to me that I was beautiful, down to the last wart.  I scanned myself, a whole person, then looked into my eyes and expressed my love for me and who I am.  I have attempted to do this kind of thing earlier in my life, but it always felt forced and incomplete.  This time it was complete and freely given.  It was amazing.   This was all part of a larger process of bringing in my separated parts to create a whole person again.   \n\n**Coming down**\n\nAt a later point, Nadia could sense I was having a hard time coming down,  so she engaged with me to help me become grounded in my body again.  I was reluctant and said that there was more to release \u2013 I could feel it.    It was an important moment for Rafiki.  He wanted to get away from Nadia, from the help she was offering, but he also knew that she loved him and that she was wise, so he surrendered.   \u201cOK\u201d he said softly, \u201cI will do it.\u201d \n\nNadia sat with me until I was ready, talked for some time, enjoying the powerful feelings of love and acceptance in that space.  As she began helping me, I could feel myself floating down, almost like a balloon running out of helium.   Nadia helped me to arrive at important realizations, especially the unifying realization that it was OK for me to be one with myself and love myself. \n\nI thought about eating a little food, but I wasn\u2019t hungry, so I went off to bed.   Before laying down, I jotted down short notes of as much as I could remember.   (I can't recommend this step enough for those who want to integrate their own experiences with psychedelics.   There is such a flood of details and insight that it's impossible to remember more than a small portion of it.)\n\nI only slept a few hours.    I woke up and ate and talked with a few of the others and we enjoyed sharing notes.   Felix couldn\u2019t sleep either and we stayed up for several more hours talking about all that we saw and experienced, receiving new ideas and new breakthroughs, but in a more rational state.   This produced an additional sense of awe, love, and appreciation.   Both of us felt like this was the most significant day of our lives.\n\n**Next day**\n\nI finally slept about 3 or 4 hours, then woke up feeling fairly well rested and quite content.   I had received far more than I expected.  From my notes and memories, I had reams of new knowledge to process and integrate.  We cleaned up the place and put the furniture back, then met in the main room again, sitting on couches and chairs and on the floor.\n\nIn this wind-down meeting we talked about what we had received.  There was a range of reception, from simple and profound peace to knock-down transformations.  We all recognized the value of all the others in making the experience successful.  I personally could see how my perception had changed from them being \u201cother\u201d to all of us part of the same whole.   The mutual feeling of pure love in the room was palpable.    \n\nWe said good-bye with lots of hugging and expressions of love.  We had all been changed.  Felix and I rode several hours home together, talking more, learning more, and listening to music.  It was blissful.  \n\n**The Week After**\n\nI am writing this section nearly a week following the experience.   The gratitude, peaceful feelings, and insights have remained largely intact.  My memories have faded significantly, so it is good I took notes as quickly as I did.   The last time I took psilocybin a year ago, it changed me and the way I think.  This time around feels the same, but bigger and more complete.  I will also mention that I think the group dynamic was at least as important as the higher dose in making the difference here.   The facilitator and the participating friend working in tandem were a major part of the benefit.  \n\nI have been interacting with my wife, family, friends, and coworkers, and I can think of at least half a dozen instances where I have adjusted my thinking and\/or behavior in direct response to what I have learned or by stopping to have a conversation with my True Self.    I feel more inclined to work and more productive.  I still have my ADHD symptoms, but I\u2019m more tolerant of my ADHD ups and downs, more compassionate to myself for how I work.   I\u2019m less combative as well because I have recast my view of others from people withholding love to people worthy of love that I have the power to give.\n\nI can remember over a week ago how I felt driving to the ceremony:  somewhat fractured, with dysfunctional ego interventions causing little micro pains emotionally.  On the day after, I felt like my fractured personality had been melted and tentatively recast into a single piece.   I would describe my internal self as feeling like a smooth blend of the Goddess, Rafiki, and my formerly repressed child-self. \n\nBorrowing from my memories of the weekend, I\u2019ve also written several pages worth of reflections, new insights and poetry to family and friends.  I certainly have better bedrock philosophy that arises from a new conception of the feminine and the importance of receptivity and love in receiving intelligence.\n\nSounds great, but are things perfect and peachy?   Well, I still have challenges.  I still have to figure out things at work and deal with negative emotions.  I\u2019m still noticing tendencies to judge myself and others.    The main difference is that I have some new tools and some new ways to feel, so I am more inclined to think that life is good.  It\u2019s easier to proceed into messy situations and see them as perfect regardless of hiccups. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this is helpful to some seekers out there.    If you take the same path, your experience will be different than mine because you have different experiences and needs, but maybe this will light up some possibilities and help you prepare.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677942477.0},{"title":"Has Anyone has a large \ud83c\udf44 trip first thing in the morning?","author":"MoorSoul","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ig5c3\/has_anyone_has_a_large_trip_first_thing_in_the\/","text":"Me and my wife usually take a large trip\/ dose(11g) at night do you feel like you get the same level of insight as you would on a night trip?","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677970918.0},{"title":"Overcoming chronic anxiety","author":"UnusualAd5436","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ih3mj\/overcoming_chronic_anxiety\/","text":"Anxiety is such a normal state for me, that I don't even recognize it normally, unless I take drugs.\n\nWhen I take drugs like cannabis, mushrooms, lsd or mdma, I always come back with the hard lesson: \n\n\"I have to build off my anxiety.

Is this all my life is going to be?\u201d You had dreams and aspirations and not all of them are going to come true. We can look at our own lives and it might seem mundane or underwhelming, or look at other people's lives, even people quite close to us and see that they seem to have everything we want. Its a really easy trap to fall into in the age of social media, seeing people\u2019s lives literally through a filter that makes it seem better than it is.\n\nIts easy to cling tightly to our dreams - we get told all the time to follow your dreams, don\u2019t give up on your dreams. Its good to have aspirations but if our happiness is attached to them then we suffer when everything doesn\u2019t pan out as we would like. Its a cliche but it\u2019s really important to try to enjoy the journey of life rather than focusing on the destination. Whats the point of grinding towards something off in the future if we can\u2019t be happy in the present?\n\nAnd here's the thing: no one's life is perfect. It might not seem like it but everyone is suffering. Everyone has their struggles and challenges, no matter how picture-perfect their Instagram feed might be. The key to enjoying our lives is to cultivate gratitude for what we have, rather than focusing on what we don't have.\n\nWhen we practice being aware and present in our own life, our own mundane existence, we can start to notice the small things in life that we might otherwise overlook. Taking a moment to appreciate the warmth of the sun on your skin, or the taste of a delicious plate of irish stew. A bird landing on the fence. Sharing a joke with a work colleague. A child laughing because you're so incredibly funny.\n\nThese small moments of pleasure might seem everyday, ordinary, but that's where life is hiding. Its hiding in plain sight in the wonderful, miracle of our existence. When we feel gratitude for our little joys, we\u2019re walking the path of happiness.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that joy isn\u2019t like the good silverware, something that we only bring out when there\u2019s a special occasion. We can apply it to the little things in our small little boring lives - in doing so they become miraculous.\n\n[Listen for more](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/is-this-it-is-this-really-my-boring-life\/id1493806566?i=1000602749944)","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677973403.0},{"title":"Did anyone experience blackness\/void on 1V-LSD?","author":"Vukovic_1501","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ikodc\/did_anyone_experience_blacknessvoid_on_1vlsd\/","text":"Happened to me on 800ug on the peak (after 1 hour taking).\n\nIt all went black but i still had conciousness and after that i paniced because i didn\u2018t understand what was going on.\n\nWhat about you?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677982579.0},{"title":"Trip report: First time using MDMA 100mg dose","author":"Unboopable_Booper","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11in3z7\/trip_report_first_time_using_mdma_100mg_dose\/","text":"So my first impressions of MDMA is that it's not what I was expecting, the trip itself was relatively mild and I was able to accomplish my intent for the trip of examining some of my trauma without the usual associated emotional distress and notice some more of my harmful thought patterns so therapy wise it was a successful trip. \n\nI have to say though, assuming I just didn't underdose or something that I don't really see the appeal of it as the party drug I was under the impression it was, some feelings of contentedness but no real euphoria and low energy levels.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677989457.0},{"title":"Here's my first psychedelic playlist for ya","author":"Educational_Ad_355","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ih4je\/heres_my_first_psychedelic_playlist_for_ya\/","text":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/37wKAsozG094b1HLwV4uRY?si=jlxs6A8QSfyK_ClfwmFXrg","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677973302.0},{"title":"CLOSENESS AND FAMILARITY DEVELOPS NEGLIGENCE","author":"unityofreligions","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11iqisq\/closeness_and_familarity_develops_negligence\/","text":"  \n\n**CLOSENESS AND FAMILARITY DEVELOPS NEGLIGENCE**\n\n*\\[Shri Ramanaiah asked \u201cWhy does God always want to remain unimaginable? Does it not leave the devotee ever dissatisfied that it is impossible to know God?\u201d Shri Swami replied as follows.\\]*\n\n\\[Message on Naga Panchami day\\] The actual reason is that the intelligence of the devotee can imagine anything, which has the spatial dimensions (length, breadth and height). Anything, which does not have the spatial dimensions, becomes logically unimaginable. You can test this point by closing your eyes and constantly try to imagine anything, which is not having spatial dimensions. Even the minutest particle that you can imagine must have some least measurable or atleast spatial dimensions, which can be calculated atleast by calculations if not by instruments. Therefore, the problem to understand God lies with the devotee and not with God. ***You have to keep God beyond the space because God is the generating cause of the space.*** You cannot find pot in the lump of mud before the generation of the pot. If you say that the pot exists already in the mud, you cannot say that the pot is generated after the preparation of the pot since the pot already exists in the mud. Therefore, the effect should not be in the cause before its generation. Hence, ***space should not exist in God before its generation.*** It means the original God before the generation of space does not have the characteristics of space, which are the spatial dimensions. This logic inevitably keeps God beyond space and hence, unimaginable.\n\nYou may argue that nothing is impossible for the omnipotent God. All impossibilities called as miracles are possible for God. Therefore, ***the unimaginable God by His unimaginable power or capability can make the devotee to imagine even the unimaginable God***. The answer for this is that God never breaks the general logic to be followed by the souls in Pravritti. Of course, God performs these unimaginable events to establish the concept of unimaginable nature. But, this one point stands as an exception and the ***other miracles are sufficient to establish the existence of unimaginable nature***. For another reason also, you should not say that God is not omnipotent due to incapability of this exception since there is a valid reason for this in the interest of not only the devotee but also God. Such valid reason is: the human being is made of ego, jealousy and negligence over the attained or known things. ***As long as an item is unknown and is not attained, the negligence, ego and jealousy subside.*** The human being always regards the distant item and neglects the item, which is present before the eyes. We can find this human nature by several examples and I can give one or two of these. People worship the statue of the serpent today, the Naga Panchami, with unimaginable devotion since the actual serpent is not seen. When it appears, it is immediately killed! People neglect their parents when they are alive and do not give meals even with one side dish. But after their death, their yearly ceremony is performed with meals containing at least a dozen side dishes! In the case of serpents, the fear for selfish harm is the reason. In the case of parents also, the same fear for the selfish harm is the reason because if the yearly ceremony is not performed, there is a fear that some harm will happen to him. This is the inherent nature and even the angels are not exceptional to this as said in the Gita (*Paroksha Priya ivahi Devaah\u2026*).\n\n***Even in the case of contemporary human incarnation, devotees worship it with lot of devotion for sometime and negligence starts slowly.*** God tested whether the human being makes God an exception to this inherent nature. Such test is the observation of the human incarnation after living with the devotees for sometime. The human being perfectly proved that even God is not an exception to its inherent nature. Even the devotee like Rukmini could not overcome this. She was daily drinking the hot milk and the Lord was normal even after drinking the hot milk. One day Rukmini gave the same hot milk to Radha. When Radha took that milk, the skin of the Lord became red due to heat. The Lord told that this happened since He is in the heart of Radha. The conclusion showed that the Lord was not in the heart of Rukmini. Rukmini asked the Lord for the reason. The Lord told that Radha was staying far and hence, the value of the Lord was maintained by her. ***This proves that anybody staying far away will have value.*** Therefore, God wants to stay far from the devotees by always becoming unimaginable so that the value can be maintained. ***When the value is broken, the Lord will feel more for it.*** He does not want to see the break of His value and feel for it. Hence, ***God avoided this one miracle not only in the interest of the devotee but also in His interest***. The interest of the devotees is that the devotee should not lose the Lord due to such negligence.\n\n===============\n\n\\-By Shri Datta Swami\n\n(Visit our website: www.universal-spirituality.org","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678000265.0},{"title":"At what point in the trip do you usually have your most profound realizations \/ breakthroughs?","author":"-crab-wrangler-","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ips4m\/at_what_point_in_the_trip_do_you_usually_have\/","text":"Iv noticed for me it usually seems to be in the comedown period.

We advocate for peace, love, unity and respect.**   \n**2. We want to be in the Now and see the beauty of life and nature.**  \n**3. We want to live peacefully (\"life is a journey\").**  \n**4. We want to be minimalistic and are against consumerism.**  \n**5. We are critical of the established beliefs in our civilization, culture and system.**  \n\n\nFirst, do you agree on this one? If one or two of you don't agree, I invite you to criticize this assessment. But if most of you do agree, then it's fair enough.  \n\n\nSo where do we go with this? It seems like *we live in a contradiction*. All our beliefs are opposed to an ordinary paycheck-to-paycheck or capitalistic lifestyle, but we still live this way. We think and say one thing, but do the exact opposite.   \nOne can come up with some excuses that it is not possible to change anything. I'd say, this argument may be valid in a developing country with really horrible living conditions, but most of us here are from a highly developed country and we really ARE able to change our lifestyles more to meet our wishes. Moreover, even back in the days where people were poorer than today people could live way more peaceful lives than most people do today. Think about monks in India, as an example.   \n\n\nBut let us consider different lifestyles that might be more in accordance with our beliefs.   \n\n\nA few ideas:\n\n  \n*1. Rural life and farming*  \n*2. Homesteading*  \n*3. Traditional jobs like fishing and hunting*  \n*4. Working in non-profit organizations*  \n*5. For more religious\/spiritual folk of you, monkhood in an established monastery*  \n\n\nThe main driver for those ideas were the 5 points of our shared beliefs that I mentioned above. They must be slower-paced, more with nature, motivate to live in the now and be minimalistic - or they must give you a sense of usefulness and a way to share love to people by helping them, for instance (that is why I added non-profits to the list).  \n\n\nWhat are some other lifestyles that you consider to be perfectly suitable for a psychonaut or that you really love to change to?   \n\n\n**All love to all of you!**","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1677960284.0},{"title":"I\u2019ll take shrooms on a plane in an hour, any recommendations?","author":"VictorrxD","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ihs5v\/ill_take_shrooms_on_a_plane_in_an_hour_any\/","text":"Edit: Was pretty fun, clouds look awesome from above (I had a window seat).\n\nOfc I didn\u2019t do a heroic\/close to ego death dose.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677974929.0},{"title":"Tips\/tricks\/recommendations for meditating on shrooms?","author":"Whoopdidoopdee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ihg3f\/tipstricksrecommendations_for_meditating_on\/","text":"Just curious if anyone has something that\u2019s worked well for them before or something you\u2019ve always wanted to try.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677974091.0},{"title":"Would it be a bad idea to trip a little more often than usual for a short period of time?","author":"TheSecularPsychonaut","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11ih8lr\/would_it_be_a_bad_idea_to_trip_a_little_more\/","text":"Normally I trip acid once a month.

But I never took over 3.5 - 4gs at one time.\n\nWell now I'm feeling fiesty so I take 6 of my blotters, I want to trip hard.

I struggled with crippling social anxiety and depression for as long as I could remember and frankly I didn\u2019t realize thats not how everyone else felt until my senior year of high school when I started drinking, I also started smoking weed but with hindsight its no surprise that it would make me more anxious but I kept smoking to attempt to be social. I then sought mental health care and continued to binge drink along with my new Adderall addiction through three years of college and drop out. After college I stopped taking Adderall and replaced with Xanax and what ever I could get ahold of. I was essentially addicted to not being sober. After a couple years of this I quit pharmaceuticals when I realized weed didn\u2019t make me anxious any more and that I really enjoyed the high. A couple months after starting to smoke again, the addictive person in me, I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the high from just flower so I jumped to concentrates. I found a good plug where I got it for cheap who also always had Psychedelics. Up until then I had   tripped a dozen or so times, I bought a whole sheet of LSD and proceeded to trip as often as I could. I fell in love with everything about LSD, the visuals, the abstract thinking, the new found perspective. It felt like the universe was hugging my brain. I would go to the occasional rave and take an uncomfortable amount because of my more is better mentality, the only choice I was left with at the rave was to, without a better way to explain it, surrender my control of thinking and just flow. Most of my trips were alone and in my apartment and in my car *I WOULD NEVER DRIVE TRIPPING* my car is parked where it over looks a grass field with a tree line in the back. I would just sit there listing to music watching the field roll like the ocean waves for hours while smoking. I started using ketamine and was floored by the strangeness of the K-hole. By this time it was about a year after I started dabbing and I was smoking a gram of wax a day even on work days. I was at a point in my life where my drug use was severely hindering my life. The LSD lost its magic no matter how much wax I smoked I wasn\u2019t high enough ketamine is expensive and I knew I didn\u2019t want to go down that road of addiction, not to mention my memory was gone. As a last hoorah I get one more gram of K and smelled it up in an hour. For the next 45 mins I experienced heaven and hell and everything in-between.

Then all of the sudden everything would go away and I was locked in another scenario with different stuff and people, and I had again the same feeling of \"this is reality\" even though everything was so incoherent!

I woke up from that experience after shortly going to a trance mind state.  Now the second I set for 30 minutes and I wasn't aware for much longer (Edit: As in I figure I lost awareness at about the same time but due to the increased length I felt that I wasn't aware for much longer the second time) but I still 'woke' up as you go back to looking up at the tree.\n\nIt really is a sober trip if you do it right and with our experience of chemical induced tripping, I think we have an edge to push our minds into accepting these mind states sober.  Thus the difference in reviews, those who know, know, right?\n\nEdit: I think I have made mention of this but with more experience I have found that chemical hallucinations are actually easier to differentiate after a 15 minute meditation in a virtual hallucination (VR).  I don't know if the meditation focuses my mind to be able to function this way or if it is a product of knowing how to differentiate a virtual environment from a physical one while sober that I am pulling into the trip. (Edit3: Although I must admit that integrating chemical and virtual hallucinations in real time is something else, feeling like my hands exist in virtual space and that I am an entity in this very real digital place.  The remoteness of it all goes away and puts everything very much in front of me as if it was regular physical reality.  I must admit that the movies we see of people being addicted to technology starts right here.  The mixture provides a fair amount of control over the entire experience if you plan accordingly and that in itself means others could use it as mass manipulation and control due to how our systems are networked.  Not to mention how I use it provides such a clear mindedness that I feel sober during a trip even though my senses are obviously tripping.  So there really is something here.)   \n\nEdit2: My next intention is to try to interface with the chemical hallucinations in the same way I can use my hands in VR to interface with the Virtual one.  I believe it is more about accepting what I can do and by applying the tools I learn from VR, it gives me a framework to trial and error the actual tools we have until the shadows of the real tools can be seen and utilized.

I have remember 1-5 dreams a night it depends if I have an intention of remembering or not so when I do go to bed thinking that I want to remember a dream I would remember more than one and if I don\u2019t then it\u2019s usually just one.\n\nAbout my dreams I want to note that I am most of the time aware during the dream and feel more like a spectator while seeing the dream, though the trippy ones do feel as I am the one going through the dream.\n\nMy latest dream:\n\nAs I slowly woke up I drifted back into my sleep and then my dream started off with seeing what I would call a sky\/barrier that was a parliament blue \/ turquoise color almost like the northern lights except it did not have that sort of depth. As I was looking at that sky with awe a feeling emerged inside of me and I told myself \u201chere we go again\u201d which after I said this I started being elevated to the sky I was describing earlier. As I was going towards this sky it started turning (funneling) and it started warping which I continued to go through it ( I am used to going through a \u201cwormhole\/portal?\u201d Not sure how to describe it) and it really started to excite me. \n\nI have a vivid imagination and I actually enjoy these dreams a lot, continuing on the color of the sky I was mentioning now started to fade into darkness and then I stoped in complete darkness where a metal object which had a indescribable language written on it came through ( I think i was in space based on the physics) after it passed me some trippy shapes\/lines started to appear (I cannot recall the exact shape or dynamics of it) afterwards a being came from behind me to in front of me almost as if the metal object + those lines were meant to explain who this being was but as I explained earlier the language was not readable it was a mixture of shapes\/letters\/special characters kind of and this went on for about 10 beings, which was very entertaining for me. Afterwards I kept moving forward and I told myself \u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d Which later a face of a beast appeared it wasn\u2019t scary so in my mind I tried to make it scarier but before I could I started to close in on it face which had his mouth open.\n\n\nOnce I started going through it\u2019s mouth (btw the background of his mouth is also black like the space I was in. Also would like to note that all of what I see is very high definition not blurry not glitchy very smooth) once I am through it takes me through another portal like word whole thing and that\u2019s where the fun begins.\n\nQuickly everything turns into like a kaleidoscope. But it\u2019s much better than that, any youtube trippy youtube video compared to this is 1\/100 scale.\n\n\nLater on I keep going through  this and I wake up in a world which I am with my family and there is a civilization around me like a city. I didn\u2019t get to explore but based on the buildings and the people I would say it\u2019s a touristy city mild climate and semi metropolitan city. The rest of the dream is me going around the city moving into a different house neighboring my parents, playing basketball. Just some daily stuff.\n\n\nAfterwards I feel my kidney hurt (in my physical body) I try to hold on to the dream but the distraction brings me back here guys.\n\n\nSo a long post I know, thank you for reading.

It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing since this was a good jinn. Also ever since my last trip my imaan (faith) in Allah has drastically increased.

The only difference is that they live in different dimensions which psychedelics can take you to and are created from smokeless fire) etc etc, assured me that I no longer have to question my faith and I cried in tears of joy because for the longest time I wanted to endeavour in my faith.\nHow has your experience been with psychedelic drugs? Do you think they are haram? I would say they are makrooh (discouraged) since they do not intoxicate the brain, they do the opposite since it has been proven they spurt neural connections and help with mental health disorders.

I treat the trip like a holographic overlay to reality and can merge the hallucinations with reality much more comfortably.

Also, my tripping buddies had these weird smiles on their faces in this 'other reality' which told me that something was wrong. Otherwise, the 'alternate reality' was very convincing, which made it worse. I finally escaped the time loop after pushing myself out of it in a rather violent way (using all my strength and leaning very hard on the edge of the 'other reality', which made me feel like I was going through some kind of wormhole). I had to repeat this three times before I managed to escape completely, as I fell back into the time loop after escaping. I feel like there must be a better way to deal with this. Can you please point me in the right direction? The time loop is my main concern before I try psychedelics again.

I tried to explain everything the best I could, she doesn\u2019t understand and know a lot about what happens and wishes she knew more. \n\nA few days ago I posted a thread about trying acid + whippets, Wednesday night rolled around and me, my gf, and her friend ended up tripping. \n\nThis was only my second trip, while my J and R have tripped for a few years now and are veterans. I took one tab while they took 3, I don\u2019t know the exact UG for the tabs but I was told they where double dipped and they were of a bigger vendor they have got off multiple times so I am guessing in the 150-250 ug range. \n\n8:30 pm: We drop the acid, I get very nervous during this time and couldn\u2019t control my body heat whatsoever, felt extremely cold and extremely hot the entire time and was very uncomfortable \n\n9:30: Around an hour mark everything starts coming around, my only prior acid trip was half a tab and to me that did not put me into a true psychedelic head space compared to this trip so far. Intense euphoria and lots of laughter at this point.\n\nFor the next few hours we chatted and hung out on R\u2019s bed while the full effects started to kick in, nothing out of this world or crazy so far, just good conversations and lots of laughter, I had about 80 whippets saved for this night with the goal of getting through them all tonight.\n\nA few hours in after chatting we end up going to J\u2019s bedroom and starting the whippets, I was extremely nervous at first and told myself I wouldn\u2019t try one until Atleast hour 6 because the acid was really intense for me at the moment.\n\nJ and R take turns doing two and three whippets with R having kaleidoscope type visuals and intense vibrational connections to the music. J does multiple but isn\u2019t having the same effects whatsoever, with a semi frustration all she is getting is intense mental time loops in her head but she\u2019s able to jump in and out of it during the whippet. The first time we noticed the loop was when she did two whippets on the bass drop of a song and me and R where waiting for something to happen or for her to say something and all she did was keep moving the whippet dispenser towards and away from her mouth in a robotic fashion. Without a word she ran out of the room and we followed not knowing what was going on.\n\nShe ran to the bathroom and then told us that to her during the whippet she felt stuck in the wall and was looping inside her mind the entire time, and the only thing she felt she was able to do in the moment was move her hand but neither me or R noticed the looping and did anything about it. We shrugged this off and went back as nothing bad happened and we all thought that it was very interested and intense the thought of being able to bend reality and do something like this. J made a comment to us mentioning how she feels something very deep at 3 whippets and wants to explore it further, but doesn\u2019t know if she should. \n\nThe night goes on and R and J go through about 40-50 whippets with extremely good whippet trips for R and J still trying to figure out what\u2019s going on with hers. I end up finally doing one whippet and for me it felt as if I hadn\u2019t moved at all but I was behind, like physically I was stationary but everything felt as tunnel vision in front of me and music and time slowed down drastically Infront of me( no visual enhancement though ): )\n\nJ picks a song and sits down to do another whippet, she takes in one full whippet and then to my knowledge \u201cphises out\u201d, her eyes blanked and it looked like she passed out for ten seconds, which is weird because she didn\u2019t hold it in for long or do anything to suppress oxygen to herself\n\nThis is where everything gets fucked. From J\u2019s telling the next day. After the whippet the right side closed onto the left side of the room like a book being slammed shut. She then fell deeper and deeper into her mind as her bedroom seemed to play in a recursive loop as she fell farther and farther away from it. She said that it felt like she was in this trance for hours while she was only out for about 10 seconds at this point. We begin to try to talk to her and wake her up while looking into her eyes it looks like a void less soul. She mentions that she started to come back and everything looked like pixel art and me and R where coming closer and closer and opened a gate for her. She then blurred out loud \u201cyou got to be kidding me\u201d and then started bursting out crying while saying I\u2019m still stuck in the loop. R then tries to reason with her and we try to ask what happened during that time but J is in utter disbelief of reality and thinks she is still in a loop and a different dimension then originally. We get her up and moving around in attempt of breaking the loop by switching up the surroundings. We move to the back porch and take the dog out then R and J go to the bathroom where J tells R not to leave her alone as she doesn\u2019t feel safe and is having the worst trip of her life. We lay in R\u2019s bed and play with the dog and put on some Harry Potter and try to constantly talk air do something to J as she is still mentally looping and disassociaing every 5-10seconds. J mentions at different parts of the night feeling \n\nShe mentions how she thinks she schizophrenic and is hearing and seeing things, this was very intense and uneasy for me during this entire trip after this point since i am still new to psyches(4 trip ever) and J has always been the one that can handle any drug with ease, and the one I can count on if shit hits the fan for me. We finish the night with J playing with R\u2019s dog and watching Harry Potter and a few other movies. J is extremely depersonalized and not cuddly and romantic and she usually would be with me. We watch the movies  till about 7am so almost 11 hours into our trip, I take J back to her room and we get ready for bed, she ends up falling asleep very fast while I\u2019m stuck awake till 1:30 pm :(, which sucked so fucking bad, being awake for hours alone shitting bricks worried about what Al just happened. Waking up though luckily everything\n seems fine, J feels better but still feels slight derealization, told us she thought we where lying to her the entire night after that point and truly lost touch of reality. Even with the trip being bad, it is still crazy to me the intensity and reaction this combo can have, and I\u2019m not sure if they will ever be touched in the future again but I\u2019m glad that I was able to see the power of it once.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677863592.0},{"title":"Este es mi subreddit favorito, pero, qu\u00e9 tal si los hispanos compartimos nuestras experiencias y\/o preguntas en espa\u00f1ol y que cada quien haga sus preguntas en su propio idioma?","author":"mgegv","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11h5qmz\/este_es_mi_subreddit_favorito_pero_qu\u00e9_tal_si_los\/","text":"Habr\u00e1 alguien aqu\u00ed que me entienda o estoy solo en esto?\n\nO creemos tambi\u00e9n un subreddit nuestro porque que horror este anglocentrismo, de verdad","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677862675.0},{"title":"Edibles make me feel like I'm in a 2008 youtube video","author":"Flunkiebubs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11g9m5w\/edibles_make_me_feel_like_im_in_a_2008_youtube\/","text":"When I take higher dose THC edibles I often get this strange sensation where I feel like I'm in an old youtube video.

After i hacked up a lung, i sat down and things got really weird. Normally with ego death my thought pattern is \"this feels weird, but I know what this is, and ill return to normal in a few hours and ill be fine\" but this time, the weed worked its way in and said \"yeah, cool, but like, what if you dont?\" And that really messed me up, then the thought loops spiraled out of control. Fortunately i did my research and knew what i needed to do, i called my brother and we just talked about stuff, i knew if i just kept talking to him until the mushrooms wore off and the weed started to come down, id be alright. And sure enough, we talked for a couple hours and i felt like myself again.\n\nSome might call that a bad trip, but the fear only really existed for like 10 minutes and i had a really good talk with my brother, plus, i figured out the feelings that i was trying to process. I think this trip gave me exactly what i needed. But the mushrooms gave me a final message, that this was gonna be my final trip, i had been waiting for a sign to stop, and I finally got it.\nThis trip sure was a roller coaster, but i think i got exactly what i needed out of it. Part of me is glad things went a little south, it felt like tough love making sure i dont come back.\n\nGoodbye Mushrooms, its been real.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677789122.0},{"title":"Anyone get tingling \/ vibration on your face while on golden teacher?","author":"TheManyFacedGod13","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11gyo03\/anyone_get_tingling_vibration_on_your_face_while\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1677843934.0},{"title":"Ego Deaths most profound attribute","author":"IGaveHeelzAMeme","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11g5wbr\/ego_deaths_most_profound_attribute\/","text":"Long story short-ish;\n\nwhat true ego death teaches (and how you know you have experienced it) is empathy\u2026 \n\nwe are born selfish and isolated from every other conscious aspect of the universe(which is not inherently bad). \n\nwhat \u201cego death\u201d does:  it strips away those boarders and allows you to \u201csee behind the curtain\u201d, and see that we are all from the same source and that every consciousness has the same derivative.. this is why people have such profound realizations after experiencing it\u2026 once you see an accept it, you become enlightened to how primitive judgment, greed, envy, and all those other selfish attributes are. \n\nFor me, nothing in the world has made me happier in life, than knowing I am not alone in my most deepest fears, loves, drive or emotions. \n\n\nWE ARE ALL THE SAME IDIOT TRYING TO ENJOY THIS LIFE. \n\n\nI love every single one of y\u2019all and hope y\u2019all love yourselves as much as you deserve.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677771860.0},{"title":"what if our spirits are broadcasting a signal and our bodies pick it up at some point in development and that's how we're here today?","author":"Cookiewaffle95","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11gr5ca\/what_if_our_spirits_are_broadcasting_a_signal_and\/","text":"Idk I pay attention to how people refer to my body my soul my person me and this seems to be the underlying tone of most people's understanding of their soul correct me if I'm wrong.

Anything and everything is possible.\n\nThe trip was incredibly traumatizing for me. Despite not seeing anything \"scary\" like monsters or violence, I found the psychosis and the inability to perceive reality quite disturbing. The visuals were overstimulating. It took about ten months or so, but I'm finally over it. I would have panic attacks (usually when smoking alone) worrying that \"oh no, it's happening again\" or fears that I somehow fried my brain. As time has passed, I've accepted that it's just my general anxiety latching onto a traumatic experience.\n\nUnfounded panic attacks aside, there was some good to come out of the experience. It cured my lifelong clinical depression. Every day I wake up I'm so grateful for everything in my life. It made me realize how much I love my girlfriend and how I want to spend the rest of my life with her. It showed me to not sweat the small things. The universe is so massive -- our tiny daily worries are so unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Once I came to accept that I didn't lose my mind, and only just experienced some crazy stuff because I was tripping balls, I truly began to appreciate the lessons I've learned.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm never touching \ud83c\udf44 again, but I'm glad I did.

What I'm getting at is that if there is a general law to the universe, I think it might be the concept of impermanence - that everything, eventually, will change, and that every variation of every possible reality will happen - and will probably happen again, and again. Maybe, for instance, I've already lived this exact version of this life an infinite number of times - paradoxically making each life eternal...\n\nWhat this means, to me, is that I don't want to base my life decisions on some \"future\" state. In the book I'm reading - The Mind Illuminated - the author argues to use logic to overcome doubt, because we can logically deduce that, in the long run, meditation will be useful for us. I believe, however, that logic can also argue that, in the even longer run, meditation won't help us, as we will still die, and in the even longer run, everything will die along with the heat death of the Universe... So I don't think, personally, that we should do anything because we want to achieve some future state - because that future state (even Enlightenment) will be fleeting, at best, in the long scheme of things. I think that, maybe, just accepting everything as it is, and living for the experience of each moment, itself, could be the only useful solution to dwelling in a reality where nothing is truly ever constant. It seems to come down to acceptance.\n\n\nWhat do you think?

One of them is a great musician, the other just a great friend. Im also a musician. The night started with us tripping downtown. Once we started feeling them, my musician friend and myself felt like jamming, and he happened to have his stand up bass with him. I grabbed my banjo, and we set up in an alley way and had a great jam session. It was clear that this was going to be a musical night. \n\n\nSoon we decided to head to by buddies house. He has a garage with a little utility room connected where we'd often hang out. I set up his electric piano in the garage and we spent a few hours bouncing between playing music in the garage and listening to music in the little room. \n\n\nAt one point, they were both in the little room listening to some music and I was in the garage playing along to what they were listening to. I'm usually pretty decent at playing along and improvising to music, but when I was peaking that night I was playing incredibly. I was so locked into the vibe, it felt like I was playing along to a song that I wrote. I was able to anticipate where the music would go many seconds into the future. I was having an absolute blast jamming to whatever they were listening to. \n\n\nAt one point, I played a particularly cool improvised lead part and wanted to see if they heard it. I went into the other room to ask them, but it was a little too loud to talk in there so I decided to pause the music...\n\n\nI paused the YouTube video they had open, but the music didn't stop. Thats when I realized there was another tab open playing music at same time. So I paused that song too... still music.\n\n\nIt turns out they had 4 songs playing at the same time. I couldn't believe it. First of all, the odds of 4 songs even being in the same key or similar enough keys is pretty low. But for the tempos to either match or be complimentary is even crazier. I'm pretty sure at least one of the songs had a different tempo which gave the resulting mix a very flowy, psychedelic feel. \n\n\nWhen I realized that I was playing along to a song that didn't exist, my mind was blown. If I hadn't experienced this, I would have thought it would be impossible to get in the groove of the combination of 4 songs. How was I able to tell where the music was going? The melody was made of 4 melodies moving independently, but they created a single, albeit complex melody.\n\n\n\nI don't remember the songs or artist they were listening to. I should have made a note of what the songs were, but I was too blown away to think straight. I'll never forget that moment of realizing there were 4 tabs open.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677768007.0},{"title":"Number of Realities","author":"Merlin321","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11gbd66\/number_of_realities\/","text":"This morning,as I sat on the LAP of a god that manifested out of the BLISS, first he asked my name, which I told him was merlin. \n\nThen my question on the number of realities?

I am new to this subreddit, but not new to the psychedelic world or the search for expanding consciousness. I recently went on a journey with 5-MeO-DMT and wrote extensively about it as a way to integrate the experience. I really wanted to share this with others in the hopes that it will educate, guide, and assist or maybe answer some questions for someone who is totally unsure what the wonderful world of psychedelics can hold for those working through trauma. Important disclaimer: every experience is unique to the individual and I firmly believe that the proper preparation to facilitate the effects of 5 (talk therapy, EDMR, counselling etc.) is necessary for its success, including the proper emotional and therapeutic support post-journey to integrate the experience. Additionally, this type of release would not have been possible for me without the trusting, caring, safe, exceptionally beautiful, open and empathic space that my facilitators created. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The ceremony space was beautiful and the blue winter light was pouring in over me as I begin this journey. This first dose was filled with subtlety and reverence. I was given 3 doses increasing in strength, the first being a very light dose to feel the radiating effects of 5 and to start to peel back the layers of my ego. The light began to fractalate and my eyes were flickering wildly, like my body and mind were searching for something. This was the first introduction, a handshake. I slowly came back to the room, basking in the warmness.* \n\n*The second dose, upped in strength, was when things really started to come into focus. I felt an emotional release just bubbling at the surface, and a depth in my soul that I couldn\u2019t fully expand. I had persistent pain in my diaphragm, an area I often tighten subconsciously due to anxiety, stress, and emotional pain. I could feel my body gently blooming, waiting for something more and beginning to release. I began to sob deeply when the 2nd dose began to wear off. A deep visceral pain I could feel to my core with every exhale. At that moment I remember feeling as though I was forcing the pain out of myself, and forcing all the sadness I had carried for so long out of my soul. I basked in the afterglow until I had a voice in my mind urging me to move forward and be intentional with my words, not \u201cI think I am ready\u201d, say \u201cI am ready\u201d. I knew there was more for me in that other realm.*\n\n*Before I could exhale the full release dose I dropped back into what felt like a muted, fuzzy version of reality. The next portion of my journey is very hard to articulate because it was one of the most painful things I have had to go through, and I truly thought that I was in sober reality. I immediately popped up out of my lying position and believed that the dose had not worked and that I had ruined it. I began to experience this intense, deeply painful wave of emotions one after the other; that I had done something wrong, I wasn\u2019t doing it right, my spiritual guides were judging me, this was weird for them, this was awkward, that I should leave, that they were being fake, they were being disingenuous, I looked stupid, and that this whole thing was a big joke. I was apologizing for how I was behaving. It was every negative emotion I\u2019ve ever felt about myself washing over me and completely engulfing me. It is impossible to describe the enormity of my terrifyingly pure pain in this moment, but it was my ego holding on for dear life, It was trying to protect my modesty, my shame, my guilt, my perfectionism, my fear of being judged, my feelings of inadequacy, my desire to be put-together at all times.* \n\n*I thought that I was ready for the experience, that I would just be able to drop back into the ocean of my consciousness and accept the journey. I did not think that the confusion and pain would be the reason why this was so incredibly profound for me. At some point, I decided that the best way to get out of this awkward and painful situation was to just lie back down, pretend to be okay with it and try to ride it out until I could get away from there and all the embarrassment that came with it. I felt watched and judged. My eyes closed and it was like my brain did a hard reset, my head ticked to the side in rhythm and in that exact moment the medicine took hold and I exploded out of my body, out of time and space and into pure bliss and complete understanding. It was like a light bulb went off in the centre of the universe and I had been transported there through the visceral pain to understand my own soul. It all clicked, I realized that they were not judging me, that none of what I believed was true. That so much of what I had thought and felt about myself in that moment was due to generational and emotional trauma from my Mother that I had carried in my programming from childhood. That programming had manifested itself in my intense perfectionism, guilt, anxiety, depression, and need for people around me to believe I\u2019m worthy. I understood it all, I saw it from a bird\u2019s eye view and...I just let it go. I emerged through the light to the other side. I was floating in my pure consciousness form. I was sobbing like I have never done before, my emotions felt like a symphony washing over me perfectly orchestrated, like I was the sparkling sunlight dancing on the ocean. I felt pure love and connectedness with all beings around me and was basking in the infinite warm bright white light. It was catharsis in its truest form. The music that was played during this portion of my journey is incredibly special to me, and the feelings of love and care by my facilitators was intense. I felt as if they were holding me, cradling me and guiding me into the light. I could feel how we are all connected, how we are all within a unity and a framework beyond our earthly understanding. Any further attempt to articulate what the full release dose experience is like would be useless, because there simply are no words that can spoken to convey the depth of the universe that you have the ability to uncover and explore. To the core of who I am as a human being, this was the most beautiful and profound thing I have ever had the opportunity to experience.* \n\n*In review of the experience with my facilitators, they said at times the person does not come out of the confusion and fights the medicine to the end, and therefore doesn\u2019t get the full effects of what is available to them in this experience. I believe this is the case if you have not done \u201cthe work\u201d to explore yourself and be open to the experience, whatever that may look like for each person. Luckily I was able to transcend that, and I believe it was because part of me knew that I had so much to let go and I\u2019ve already been on an introspective journey with a therapeutic support for many years. Once I overcame those feelings I felt as though the final puzzle piece was slammed into place. It all made sense.* \n\n*All that said, the following months were very difficult for me. I had found a new baseline of calmness and unity within my soul and anything that was a threat to that, any sort of stress, was intense, scary and all consuming to the point of impending doom. An important thing to understand about a 5 experience is that it can be very destabilizing, and you have to continue to integrate and to work to overcome anything that continues to reveal itself. I struggled through those months and needed additional support. I continued to remember certain points in my journey and felt embarrassed for how I acted in that state, scared, stressed, unbalanced, and I really leaned into those feelings and asked myself - where does this come from? Why am I feeling this way? I\u2019ve learnt so much about myself in reflection. It was more progress in healing than I have done in years of therapy. I have really been able to tap into my programming, behaviour and my soul. By my coach\u2019s guidance, I should not be scared to open my soul up to this perceived attack on what I had learned in my journey because I had kept a piece of that unity in my heart. I brought something back and I should not be scared to lose it. It\u2019s permanently imprinted. I also had to realize that much of what was coming up is referred pain from other moments of my life, things that happened to me as a child, the way I was treated and forced to be hyper vigilant of the emotions of my parent. I learned that I am extremely sensitive to the energy around me. I should not be ashamed of that, I should not let my ego guide my existence socially or in my day to day life. Nothing up to this point in my life has taught me a greater lesson and I\u2019m very excited to go back and continue the teachings.*","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677722533.0},{"title":"Aya trip report (I guess?)","author":"humble-monkey","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11g08lh\/aya_trip_report_i_guess\/","text":"Greetings humans!\n\nI tried Ayahuasca for the first time mid February and feel so excited to share what I've experienced but don't have many people around me that would like to hear about it.

I wasn\u2019t invited, but I\u2019m welcome to join.\n\nFlying around me, teasing me but not acknowledging my existence. I try to embark, holding onto the moving shapes. Almost as if joining an object in centrifuge, feeling myself spinning while hitchhiking in a majestic, gigantic junction of energy and power. I let go and come back to earth. The helper looks at me and almost as if reading my mind, offers another cup of the medicine.\n\nMy stomach is churning, my body seems to be rejecting what I have just ingested.

I am dissolving! Where does my body start and where does it end? Am I melting into the floor? Am I, I? There is a clear and obvious separation of my physical being and the voice inside my head (consciousness?).\n\nAll my feelings, fears, desires are so clearly present with all their might, all at once. Detached from my body, I find myself (?) wondering where the voice inside my head comes from. When I open my eyes, I see the room in which I was, but it\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s like a different reality, different layers on top of each other. Am I watching a movie or is this my imagination? Am I really here?\n\nA strong feeling of gratefulness overwhelms me, as I bring my hands together in front of my chest. I let things come to me naturally and what I see is a tunnel of all I\u2019ve ever seen and experienced in this lifetime. I can disembark and reexperience any event or moment. I\u2019ve lost count of how many people I have visited, waved at, hugged, thanked.\n\nI end up in a void. The voice inside my head starts to dissipate slowly. The sounds around me in the physical world, start echoing as if getting more and more distant, melting away. A lump in the very centre of my body, the so called feeling of desperation, grief, guilt, helplessness. It hurts, but I let it consume me.\n\nSlowly, the silence takes over, complete darkness.\n\nThe body I inhabited for all these years has disappeared, dissipated, dematerialized while the voice (consciousness?) accepts the separation. \u201cI accept if it is time for me to go. Thank you. It was beautiful\u201d\n\nAnd then, I was no more.\n\nAs I accept that \u201cI\u201d have seized to exist, the music starts to appear again in the distance and it becomes louder, almost like resuscitating me.\n\n\u201cHow long is this going to last? I want out!\u201d\n\n\u201cAceita que d\u00f3i menos\u201d\n\n\u201cTime will pass.

You guys felt it too?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m alone but somehow we have lived this together. All of us with our own perspective, in our own timeline, next to each other, alone.\n\nI leave the room to wander around. Carolina, serelepe (happy, energetic) and talkative. \u201cHow can she socialize? I\u2019m still in another dimension\u201d\n\nI try to talk but my stomach is still rejecting the medicine. I don\u2019t want to bother the others, so I roam around and watch them from a distance.

My chest, face and arms got super hot, I got a very intense head rush (almost like a whippit, but like 50x) and in a second I watched my vision go from completely normal to a kaleidoscope, everything was broken up into hexagon type shapes. I held it in for about 30 seconds, exhaled, and laid back and closed my eyes. Immediately I saw an outline of a face, I couldn\u2019t make out any specific details, but it was a grey outline, almost as if drawn by a pencil, shortly after the face vanished, and it was all black as I felt myself lunging forward, then come to a halt (around this time the come up was STRONG, I was thinking it was too intense to handle, and I didn\u2019t want to do it anymore, eventually I said out loud \u201cit\u2019s just a drug, it\u2019ll be over soon\u201d and my mind cleared and everything felt super blissful) then start moving forward again slowly.

I wanted to commune with the divine. I was interested in the nature of God, heaven, and hell, and if I could talk directly to God. I also suffer from treatment-resistant depression plus OCD, and tried plenty of treatments, from ECT and TMS to Spravato, so I wanted to see if psilocybin may help. \n\nDuring the comeup, I started to laugh-cry. So, I'd be watching funny YouTube videos and laughing more than normal.\n\nWhen the effects kicked in more intensely, I experienced time dilation. My ego dissolved; I had trouble accessing my memories, so I felt like a whole new person, as if I just came out of the womb. And I felt like I've always been experiencing this: that there was no beginning, and there will not be an end. Also, I felt like I was at union with the universe. I questioned concepts such as self-identity, matter, consciousness, even existence.\n\nThen, at its most intense, I sat up, and just let go. (I even peed my pants \ud83d\ude05). And it felt like I opened my eyes for the very first time. I have paintings in my room, so I looked around, and I laughed from joy. I appreciated colors 1 million times more. I kept saying \"WOW!\" and \"DAMN!\" and \"WHAT AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE!\"\n\nEvery trip has its good and bad.\n\nThe bad? So, I experienced ego dissolution, but more specifically, it felt as if I just died, and that I resurrected, so that I was in the afterlife. Initially when the experience got intense, I started having different contradictory visual images of people I thought were God. At some points, I thought God was Donald Trump, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, and even Beyonce\u0301. At other points, however, I thought God was Osama bin Laden, or Adolf Hitler, or Bashar al-Assad. I didn't resist these thoughts; I let them come and go. But you can see how terrifying it was to think, \"damn, this sadist turned out to be God, and I didn't believe in him, so he's going to throw me in hell in a few secs.\"\n\nThe good? Remember that I felt like I died. I started having deep regrets about not having spent enough time with my family or pets. That I didn't live life to a good potential. Couple that with the feeling that this hallucinogenic experience I was in is never-ending, and what I got was a serious conviction that I should focus on what matters and seize on life. I got the answer to the question \"does hell exist?\" Hell isn't a fire burning me forever; it's the inability to turn back the clock and enjoy life. Because time is fleeting, and once the people I love go, I'll never get them back.\n\nThis was an amazing experience, both visual and spiritual. I transcended my flesh and entered new dimensions. I'm still struggling to integrate such a transformative experience, and it had its ups and downs, so there are positive and negative effects. But I still enjoyed it, and even the bad times are of utility. Not all my questions were answered, and some answers were contradictory if not wrong, but I appreciate the whole experience, and it was worth every penny.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1677692879.0},{"title":"Media (videos or podcasts) with people giving detailed trip reports?","author":"cedarandspruce","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11fubxf\/media_videos_or_podcasts_with_people_giving\/","text":"I watched How to Change Your Mind recently and now it\u2019s m hooked on listening to people\u2019s trip reports.

It is the story of all our lives. In the Truman show the person who plants the seed is the character Sylvia. She tries to tell him that he is a show and they fire her. After that he starts thnking about her all the time. Even though she is a love interest, I see her as his higher self, the soul. In latin derived languages, the soul is feminin (Ame, Alma\u2026) Even in german.\nIt is the higher self that always tries to direct us and protect us. But we are manipulated by the script writers and all the temporary actors who keep us trapped in the fake Matrix. When he reahes the end of the fake stage, he goes up the white stairs. That can be him elevating himself from the lower self that is the puppet of the matrix, to his higher self that is more connected to the divine.\n\n\nWhen the soul finally takes over, we can no longer stand this place. We just want to get to the other side. In this reality, we cannot wait for death in order to unite with the soul. We have to overcome many storms to do so. The matrix will throw many traps at us. It will try to break\/corrupt our hearts and mind so that we always remain slaves of the system. In movies, romance is always the carrot at the end of the stick. But we must become complete within. We must go up those stairs and elevate our consciousness. We must live the other side of reality while we are still in these bodies. We can seek inner freedom. This is when we realize that we are own saviors. This is what Truman had to do. He had to save himself. Truman was no longer a matrix \u201cshow\u201d main character, but his soul took charge and helped him cross the ocean. Took his fate in his own hands.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677713243.0},{"title":"Alcohol and psilocybin induced psychosis","author":"Obvious_Assistance","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Psychonaut\/comments\/11fia27\/alcohol_and_psilocybin_induced_psychosis\/","text":"Hi everyone, my husband had a terrible trip recently when he took mushrooms after a day of drinking (and continued to drink.) he put me through a nightmare, which I\u2019m still recovering from. \nWe have tripped many times together, and one other time had a bad trip due to him acting crazy, but alcohol was involved then too. \n\nHe is now sober from alcohol.

I understand if no one has an answer or any guidance.\n\nI am schizophrenic, and I used to smoke weed a lot. The thing is that it aggravates my symptoms (mainly hallucinations). It acts as a psychedelic to me and most schizophrenics, and seems to transport me into another dimension; it\u2019s as if one of my \u201cgood\u201d voices answers all questions I have about life, the universe, etc. (I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the voices are my subconscious manifesting into something I can understand, and these answers are actually in the back of my mind). Unfortunately, something will trigger me to have terrible hallucinations (usually my own thinking of it happening, without fail. Occasionally it\u2019s something external) but it wasn\u2019t always like that, until I decided my schizophrenia was a curse, and some life changing events.\n\nSo I was wondering, if you have more experience seeing into the human psyche, do you think that the \u201cdemon\u201d is actually a part of my subconscious, too? Do you think I\u2019d be able to \u201cbattle\u201d this \u201cdemon?\u201d How would I go about that? Or is it a fruitless endeavor and I\u2019m safer staying away from anything like this? I had to quit because of how nasty it gets, and how much it affected my life, but I would like to be able to smoke again and possibly explore this crazy, unique mind. Many schizophrenics I know are helped by weed.\n\nNote I do have a lot of trauma and grew up around twisted people, so it\u2019s possible it was seeded since childhood. I just don\u2019t know if that is the case, or if it\u2019s because of my schizophrenia (though those in eastern cultures experience very positive and helpful voices thought to be due to differences in religion.

But what was even more fun was the headspace, it felt remakably peaceful and the visuals were psychedelic, unlike typical psychs but it was very fluid and there was a noticable pattern.\n\nI actually saw how my reality was building up in front of me and then I was there thinking \"wait lol why the fuck am I watching netflix on my notebook even though I am laying under my blanket\", so I zapped out to make sure than I am not going nuts, then I tried getting there again but just fell asleep I guess.\n\nEither way, when I am actually sober, sp can be terrifying, like a bad acid trip, less intense \/ less vast but the confusion, terror, anxiety, feelings of impending doom are similar.

I took around 150ug about a month ago and also took about 3 grams of shrooms about 2 weeks ago. Due to the situation I'm in, the courts may specifically request for these tests to be done with hair. I filed a petition against my son's mother a couple of months ago because she was subjecting him to an unsafe environment. Now the courts and CPS are involved and I have temporary full custody. We went to court yesterday and CPS requested to hair and urine test her and the judge granted it. Her lawyer argued that I should have to do the same and the judge denied it based on the fact that they didn't have sufficient evidence that I may be a drug user. Her lawyer is either extremely bad at his job or did not prepare for this case at all because he didn't even mention the fact that I am a convicted felon (I was arrested for drug trafficking marijuana and psychedelics in 2020 and am still on probation). I have to go to court again in about a month and I feel like there is a chance her lawyer will bring this up again along with the fact that I am a convicted felon.
