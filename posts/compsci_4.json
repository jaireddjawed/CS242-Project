I don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôve got enough CS classes under my belt. I have only one sophomore level class left and then my entire junior and senior level CS classes to go. It‚Äôs my last summer and I know traditionally internships are taken at this time. Additionally, i live in a horrid small town with maybe 2 internship opportunities for CS students. To further add the the stress, my family is planning a cruise and a trip to japan. I would hate to miss out but i feel like if i don‚Äôt snag an internship, i‚Äôll be at a big fat disadvantage upon graduating. Any advice on what steps to take next?",

I haven't seen too many people discuss Hugging Face's platform so I decided to write about my experience with it and how others like me (An undergraduate compsci major) may get started with some of their free pre-trained models.  \n\nThis is my first time writing a public article like this so please let me know what feed back you have!  Just don't light me up too hard! üòÇ\n\n[https://medium.com/@egray4cs/practical-introduction-to-ai-and-machine-learning-with-hugging-face-db8c11a86efa](https://medium.com/@egray4cs/practical-introduction-to-ai-and-machine-learning-with-hugging-face-db8c11a86efa)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions I'd be glad to share a bit about what I have learned from using a few of their models.  I am definitely not a genius on the subject matter but do enjoy tinkering with tech like this and would love to introduce it to others if possible!",

        "text": "I have to do similar exercises for an assignment, but a little more complicated than the example in the title. My professor wrote down in the question to construct a \"regular grammar\" with a fixed length in EBNF. From what I've learned so far, regular grammars (unlike context-free grammars) have a strict form in their production rules, such as (in right-linear) A -&gt; x, A -&gt; xB, or A -&gt; B, where A and B are non-terminal with A as the start symbol.\n\nThe way I would personally write production rules for a regular grammar of exactly three digits is like this:\n\n&lt;S&gt; ::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9&lt;D2&gt;\n\n&lt;D2&gt; ::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9&lt;D3&gt;\n\n&lt;D3&gt; ::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9\n\nwhere the start symbol is S. So when generating sentences conforming to this language, it would be any of the first few digits followed by the non-terminal &lt;D1&gt;, which allows a second digit followed by non-terminal &lt;D3&gt;, and then finally it allows only for a third digit to end the sequence.  This seems right to me but also too simple. I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Could anyone with knowledge of this topic help me out?",

My question is, what is the general opinion on putting unfinished personal projects on LinkedIn for other people to view? Is it better to post it now and mention that I'm currently working on it, or would it just be better to finish it and post it. I have a few projects on my page, but this one is the biggest one any of us have tried, so it would be an asset to have posted.  I'm a CS major in my first year, and this is all new to me, so I would appreciate any advice on the topic.\n\n\\*in terms of unfinished, I mean the UI and front end is all complete, it's just our database was having some problems that we weren't able to fully resolve in that time frame, but it shouldn't be too hard to implement as a personal project",
