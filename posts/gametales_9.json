        "text": "Figured I'd share my tale here! Whilst hanging out in church, a young teenager, O, was amused to hear that a bunch of grown-ups were playing Dungeons and Dragons, and asked how it was played. Since I had my D20 handy (never leave home without it) I decided we had 10 minutes to kill on a story.\n\nSince she was a newbie and all, I was really liberal with my rules.\n\nMe: Okay, let's give you a taste of it. This is a D20 die, it's how we're gonna randomize things in this story, cool?\n\nO: It's so pretty... (translucent green die)\n\nMe: Yeap. Alright, first you need to pick a character, you can be absolutely anything you'd like to be.\n\nO: A purple Dragon!\n\nMe: Sure, you are a mighty purple Dragon with 3 spells - Invisibility, Fire Bolt, and Faerie Fire. You also have wings, so you can fly-\n\nO: Hold up, are you serious?! I can do this?!\n\nMe: Absolutely. Now, what kind of place would you make your home? A mountain? A volcano? A forest?\n\nO: A beach!\n\nMe: Excellent, you're a dragon who has made their home on a rock outcropping by the beach, with a beautiful view of the sunrise. As a new day dawns, an elder from the nearby village approaches, leaving an offering of different treat at the alter near your nest. You see...\n\nO: I'm a good Dragon!\n\nMe: Oh? Err. Yes, that's what you are. Erm. He speaks, \"Oh, mighty O! We need your help! Bandits have begun attacking our village, harassing our people! We need your help to drive the-\"\n\nO: What does Faerie Fire do?\n\nMe: Coats the area around you in sparkly lights, enabling you to see invisible objects and light the area up a little.\n\nO: I spread my wings, roar, and cast Faerie Fire to intimidate the old man!\n\nMe: Sure. Roll to intimidation.\n\n(Roll 2) \n\nMe: As your wings spread, the sunlight catches your scales as your rear your head and unleash a mighty roar. Lights dance in the vicinity, and the old man turns to gaze upon them with wonder. His eyes open wide with wonder and he looks to you with awe in his eyes...\n\nO: Damn it. Fine, I take off to the village!\n\nMe: You leap into the air and soar towards the seaside village. How do you want to proceed? You could search the nearby forests, or wait for the bandits, or...\n\nO: I land in the middle of the village!\n\nMe: As you draw close to the village square you see children playing in the morning sun. They turn and begin to point at you, then scatter screaming as you land in the middle of the village square. All around, the children have raced back to their parents, all eyes peering at you curiously.\n\nO: I cast Invisibility on myself!\n\nMe: You vanish. Now what?\n\nO: I'll wait, duh!\n\nMe: Sure. Behind you, to your left, you begin to hear a scuffle. A gruff voice scowls, \"Food, gold, everything you have, woman!\" A second voice calls out, along with the ring of a sword being drawn, \"Yeah, lady! Do it or your precious child bites it!\" A third voice nervously stammers, \"Guys, I'm really not sure this is such a good idea...\"\n\nO: I wanna turn and face them!\n\nMe: As your whip your head around, you see three thugs on the street near a building: One is holding a woman off the ground by her neck. Another has his sword drawn and is holding it to the throat of a child, who's crying and desperately trying to look brave...\n\nO: No... (hah! I knew that would get her invested!)\n\nMe: The third thug is nervously standing apart from the others, his hands fiddling with-\n\nO: I cast Fire Bolt! On the guy strangling the lady!\n\nMe: Roll to hit.\n\n(Roll 17)\n\nMe: You open your maw, and a bolt of fire launches at the thug, engulfing him in flames! He drops the woman, screaming in anguish! The thug with the blade drops his blade, a look of terror on his face as he sees a mighty Dragon materialize before him! The third thug just kinda... He's pissing his pants.\n\nO: (giggles) Yay!\n\nMe: The lady grabs the child, and runs away! The thug with the sword grabs his blade and rushes to attack you!\n\n(Rolls a 2)\n\nMe: His blade strikes, but harmlessly richochets off your dragonhide! The fearful thug readies his bow, nocks an arrow, and shoots!\n\n(Rolls a 2)\n\nMe: You trace the path of the arrow as it harmlessly pings off your hide.\n\nO: (grins maliciously) One of them is near me right?\n\nMe: He's right next to you, yeap.\n\nO: I use my jaws and snatch him up, giving him a good shake! Then I throw him into the air!\n\nMe: Are you... (wow, this girl) Throwing him at anyone?\n\nO: I throw him into the air! Then I'll use my tail to hit him towards the scaredy cat!\n\nMe: You whip your head around, and with a quick snap, you grab the thug by the scruff of his tunic! You shake your head, tossing him about like a ragdoll, before throwing him up into the air! He flies up screaming.... and falls down... Roll to hit!\n\n(Rolls 20, wow)\n\nMe: Your tail connects with his body, bending it unnaturally. The force of your strike is so great! It hurls him at the timid thug, pinning him beneath his unconscious body!\n\nO: Hah!\n\nMe: At this time, you notice the villagers beginning to come out of their homes, staring at the sorry state of the thugs. One is burnt to a crisp, the other is battered unconscious, and the last is a gibbering mess! Their eyes begin to burn with anger and they slowly begin to approach the thugs...\n\nO: I spread my wings and fly back home!\n\nMe: As you fly off you hear the desperate screams of the fearful thug, \"No, wait, stop! Please, I didn't wanna do this! Mercy!\" And over the course of the next few weeks the villagers begin to bring you daily gifts! They bring the finest of their lambs and meats...\n\nO: I'm vegetarian.\n\nMe: Okay, then... They give you the first fruits of all they have harvested, and you continue to preside as their protector for as long as you live! The end!\n\nO: (immediately runs off to do some other thing)\n\nWell. Small success I suppose?",

        "text": "Around 2 years ago I had the idea to put my party against a [False Hydra](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/09/false-hydra.html), and it turned out so much better than I expected. \n\nIf you don't care to read the link, a False Hydra is an evil beast with 2 curious properties that make it especially deadly. The creature constantly sings an eldritch song that allows it to live in your blind spot; you could look right past it and never know it was there. It only stops singing to eat, leaving it temporarily vulnerable. \n\nSecond, and more pernicious still, the False Hydra's song erases the memories of its victims from those who knew them in life. Husbands will come home to a closet full of clothes belonging to a wife they don't remember. \n\nThe party arrives in a town inhabited by one of these Fel beasts on a cold foggy night. I had everybody roll will saves, handing out cards with what everyone sees and experiences, based on their rolls. Lowest roll wanders off into the fog alone, hears a sudden silence and a rush of motion but by the time he turns around, there's only a mysterious bloodstain on the ground. \n\nAfter the party regroups I demonstrate the Hydra's powers on a Goblin NPC that had been following the party around. Goblin wanders off into the fog, there is a moment of profound silence as the Hydra stops singing, and when a player asks me what happened to the goblin I say something like 'what goblin? There was never a Goblin here that you know of.'\n\nThe party accomplishes their task in the area and gets the hell out of town. As they make camp the PCs notice some... irregularities with their equipment. There's a bag filled with a bunch of tiny clothing and a Spellbook in handwriting they don't recognize. The kicker was a charcoal drawing of the party that my wonderful wife did, drawn in-universe by a grateful artist saved by the brave heroes. In the drawing, the group includes a Gnome Wizard none of them recognize.\n\n\nIll always remember the looks on my players' faces as they slowly pieced together that there had always been this wizard in the party, but this monster had made them 'forget' he had ever existed in the first place.",

        "text": "   I was excited to play a higher level wizard  (lvl10) and the DM had a cool setup in a homebrew world, as well as some tweaked rules/classes/etc. Our small party of three were sort of important folks helping a fledgling kingdom operate. \n\n   In addition to my Magister, the other pc's were the princess of said kingdom and the Spymaster of said kingdom. When we started this game, we had to accomplish some missions and my wizard went investigating with an equally powerful npc. We found trouble, reported back to the royals what we found and then we're  charged with heading back into the wild to meet the bad guy and try and gather more info. The princess and I gathered up the Spymaster but before we left, they decided the princess wouldn't go off into danger. We instead travelled with the High Priest. He was a scary dude and made my wizard feel better since I was extremely squishy.\n\nThe bad guy was a powerful creature dishing out death and ultimatums! I had hoped to bring soldiers but wasn't able too. Now my guy had firepower but was terrified of getting damaged at all so three of us vs big bad wasn't looking too promising. \n\n   We came across the bad guy and took the approach of dealing with the ultimatums, hoping to avoid the death part. As we spoke, he got pissed and insta-killed the High Priest! I had tried some spell the first time I met this guy and he just waved it off, so I knew it was pointless to attack him. After some words were had we were warned to leave and bad guy took off. Spymaster wanted to try and follow so we attempted to track him. \n\n   After a bit of travelling, we came across a strange short wall with symbols on it. Spymaster heard whispers emanating from it listened closely, vanishing into the wall!\n\n   I had to try and free her, but all the knowledge rolls didn't help me figure out a way to free her. I had heard of magic trapping devices that had to be destroyed to free the captured people, so I did my best to annihilate the wall with fire and explosions!\n\n   It worked, the wall was destroyed! No one was released though.....\n\n   Turns out that the wall was a contained civilization hiding from that bad guy for the last however many years... I killed the Spymaster and destroyed a civilization....\n\n   Oh...and the Spymaster was related to the royals so they really didn't like that...\n\n   So the Magister was exiled (they almost killed me but I'm a likeable coward!)\n\n",

The fight to end all fights. The battle against the Archomentals was colossal, but the Tsethem had been given a fair amount of time to prepare. They were walking into this one completely blind.\n\nI expected an epic last stand, similar to something out of a modern day superhero movie. The Elder Eye was going to be a huge purple, literal eye, floating above the ground and shooting death rays down at them. I actually statted it all up in advance, giving it a deadly challenge rating of 30. It was going to be the four Tsethem vs. a final, insanely hard boss. But now I don't think I'll ever get to use that statblock.\n\nYou see, the virtual DM had one final twist to add to the tale of the four original Tsethem. There was to be no epic battle to cap their story. No titanic boss. When Della, Flamer, Lundal, and Turf all stepped through the portal, they were confronted by someone they never thought they'd see again. By someone *I* never thought they'd see again. \n\nTiseo. Tiseo was the Elder Eye. \n\nHis broken, painfully emaciated body was leashed on a chain in the middle of an endless shadowy moonscape. Sightless eyes stared at the heroes through a thin layer of grey skin. This was impossible. Tiseo was back in the ruins of Orthraze, locked away for his part in the dragon cult uprising. I assumed the vDM had made a mistake, and was about to ignore the random event it had thrown my way. \n\nBut then I stopped. I took some time out, and puzzled it over. Made a few rolls, referenced a few timelines. And eventually, it made sense. Tiseo was the Elder Eye. *And he was also in Orthraze*. \n\nThe ragged figure sitting before them spoke, his voice cracked with age and rot. And the story he told them was one that even Lundal found incredulous. \n\nIt had all started on another Tirkosu. Call it what you want; alternate dimension, splinter universe, separate timeline, etc. It was a version of reality with a history that completely coincided with the prime reality, up until the uprising of the Primadan extremists. In that world, the elemental evil cultists had never existed. Della had never summoned her team a second time to defeat the elemental prophets, the bombing of Rahg Krahv hadn't occurred, and Orthraze had never fallen. Turf's team was simply known as the people who retrieved the Forever Stone. \n\nTiseo had eventually tried to take the Stone From Della, and the events had played out in a similar fashion; a demon had tried to possess him, causing his deeds to be discovered and ending in his imprisonment. But Orthraze still stood in that world, so keeping him there was a liability. Instead, they banished him to a demiplane; the void. \n\nThat was the single biggest mistake the leaders of that world could have ever made. Because the void realm wasn't simply a place of barren rock and shadows; it held a connection to the plane of time. A connection that could be harnessed by those living within its boundaries. \n\nTiseo had become one with the void. He was now a master of time, and could use his mind's eye to view the whole of history as it unfolded. Using proxies and pawns, he sewed seeds in the Primadan church that grew to form the cultists of elemental evil. This created a paradox where two Tiseos existed in the same world; one patiently waiting for a chance to take the Forever Stone off Della, and one pulling the strings as the Elder Eye. \n\nThe Tsethem were dumbfounded. Tiseo had been behind literally every major threat they'd faced. The elemental cultists, the Archomentals, even the shadow dragon that had brought down Orthraze. But he wasn't done with his exposition yet. \n\nHe explained that as time was relative in the void realm, killing or removing him from it would undo all his actions. The clock would effectively be reset to his first interference, which was with the Archomentals; one thousand years in the past. \n\nIt was a loop. The Tsethem had to choose between allowing his continued existence in the void, from which he could spread his evil further, and killing him, effectively dooming the world to repeat its history over again. It was checkmate of the highest order. There was no way to win, as every choice led to a game over. The Tsethem were finally beaten; I was at a loss for a way they could break the endless circle. \n\nThen Tiseo began to taunt them. He revealed that, as he was the centre of the paradox, he remembered the previous timeline. And all the timelines that came after. Apparently, this wasn't the first reality on which they'd come to this spot, with this choice to make. They'd been doing this over and over again, through multiple existences. Every time he had eventually been killed, sometimes by the Tsethem and sometimes by other heroes, who had stood up to him long after Flamer and Co. were gone. \n\nTiseo had reached the goal he'd become obsessed with; he was unkillable. Della tried to plead with him, asking him what the point of it all. The Elder Eye gave a ragged, cackling laugh, and said there only one point; because it was fun. It was fun to watch the misery of the thousands who'd \"wronged\" him. It was fun to observe the people of Tirkosu scurry like ants from the devastation his worshipers caused. It was fun to see the suffering he gave the Tsethem; Della's loss of her elven side, Lundal's anguish about the genie's wish, and Turf's tragic encounter with her brother on Mt. Tirkosu. He was responsible for their sorrows. And he relished in it. \n\nTurf stepped forward with fury coursing though her veins, and impaled the Elder Eye through the chest. \n\nThe other three cried out for her to stop, but I wasn't worried. Tiseo's monolog had sparked an idea, and I now knew how he could be defeated. And so did she. \n\nThe weapon she was holding wasn't Revenge, her usual sword. It was the voidblade. The weapon that, when used to deliver a killing blow, would freeze the target in time, and throughout all instances of time. Many works of fiction use the \"fixed point in time\" theory. That's similar to the effect of the voidblade, but each moment of the target’s life become unchangeable. \n\nTiseo screamed as his actions were irrevocably anchored in history. The void realm couldn't handle the sudden change to its rules, and began to implode on itself. Soon there was nothing left but white. \n\n* * *\n\nFlamer opened his eyes, which was a nice surprise. You'd think that being caught in a collapsing demiplane would kill you, but apparently they'd survived. He and the rest of the team were standing in the middle of a vast field of silver grass. A bunch of marble archways stood in a circle like a classy Stonehenge. The heavens opened, and a powerful voice called down to them. \n\nIt was the Supreme One, the god Della worshiped. She was as awestruck as the other three. He told them that the planes were in need of princes, now that the Archomentals were gone. And unlike the last rulers, the Tsethem had proven themselves to be worthy. They were rather confused, as they thought the Archomentals (and Primordials in general) were supposed to embody the elements themselves. So the Supreme One told of Tirkosu's relatively short history. \n\nIn the beginning, the Primordials had walked the planes. They were spirits of the elements and guardians of the people; the ten races living on Tirkosu has also originally resided with them. Time passed, and all was peaceful. Then the Colossi of shadow, Nekrahtrox, created Tiamat in an attempt to conquer the other planes. There was a plane-spanning war in which much of the fire race was destroyed. To keep their people away from the combat zones, the Primordials created Tirkosu as a temporary refuge. \n\nThe war raged for two hundred years before concluding with Tiamat's banishment. While the majority of the populace decided to return to their home planes, those who had built a life on Tirkosu were allowed to stay. That was roughly eight hundred years ago, and the island was still standing strong. \n\nTo ensure that Nekrahtrox would never threaten the planes again, the other ten Colossi used a tremendous amount of their combined energies to completely seal off the plane of shadow. They knew the effort involved would send them into a coma until they recuperated, but it was a price they were willing to pay. They put their favorite Archomentals in charge of the planes in their absence, thinking they would be the best choice to rule. \n\nAs it turned out, they weren't. Being handed all that power sent some of the Archomentals down a dark path. It was clear now that the title of elemental prince couldn't just be given; it had to be earned. And the four original Tsethem had proven themselves worthy. \n\nThey accepted their new titles with grace. The Supreme One gave them a blessing, and opened the portals to their new kingdoms. But before they departed, the four friends asked to return onto Tirkosu to deal with one matter on their minds. The planes were vast, busy places. Ruling over one would take up all their time. But they weren't about to leave their home unprotected. \n\nThey stepped back onto the volcano, where the banquet was winding down. They explained the situation to the other Tsethem, leaving out the mind-bending specifics of the Elder Eye's origin. Naliko had a funny moment where she offhandedly remarked that she could sense they weren't telling the whole story, which was casually ignored by everyone. \n\nFarewells were said and tears were shed, before the new princes and princesses of the elements handed on the mantle of Tsethem. They offered the title to some of the heroes from Pernep; Callie became the Tsethem of earth, Kilmorn of air, Vanella of steam, and Elo of fire. They promised to protect their respective villages from all harm, and in return received the blessing of the elemental princes. \n\nThen it was time to leave for their kingdoms. They stepped through the portal, heads held high; at one with their elements.\n\n* * *\n\nAnd thus concludes the tale of the Tsethem, at least from the perspective of the islanders. Is this the actual end of their story? Nope. Do they return again in the campaign? Hells yes. The story of Tirkosu is far from over, and many secrets are yet to be revealed. \n\nIn a way, it wasn't really an ending; it was a beginning in disguise.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nLooking back, I realise how much of a role Time played in in the campaign, even after the Elder Eye's defeat. It doesn't feel like a fantasy time travel story, but it could definitely be classed as one.",

My group has finally passed level 1 (The sheer amount of time taken for this has meant that I'm moving from a monster XP to a plot XP system), with some interesting results along the way. This series is meant mostly as a perspective of a new GM, but I hope you might get some enjoyment from it.\n\n--------\n\nSo we return to the party in the Golden Braid inn, the cellar of which they had previously cleared of a rat infestation. The innkeeper had kindly offered to put up the party in two single bed rooms, and feed them for a while as long as they'd be on hand to clear out any more rats for him. After the disaster of the previous day, the Cleric was none too pleased with the others in the party and so stormed off to one of the rooms and locked himself in. The Warlock and the Rogue set up in the other room, the Warlock on the bed, and the urchin Rogue curling up in the corner with a blanket. The Druid tried to get the Cleric to let her in to his room, but with the help of the command spell, he sent her packing. Instead, the Druid made her way outside to sleep on a bed of leaves under a tree.  \nThat concluded the first session.\n\nAs the Warlock and Rogue's players arrived first for the second session, we had a little lighthearted fun. With the help of constitution and perception rolls, we determined that the Warlock woke up the Rogue from his slumber in their shared room through copious amounts of noxious farts (Yes, we are infantile sometimes, sue me). Meanwhile, outside the inn, the Druid was woken up by a scruffy boy kicking her awake. After an angry exchange the Druid called the boy a rude word pertaining to the area between a lady's legs. They boy, continuing on the line of inane questioning, asked her what it was. As a result the Druid ended up flashing the kid who, having experienced his sexual awakening, ran off home. (This was mostly joking around with the Druid's player, taking anything she says and making it IC if it's funny and harmless enough.)\n\nAfter their morning antics, the party sans Cleric were all hanging around in the inn having breakfast (skinned rat for the urchin, sneakily cooked on the open fireplace.) The Cleric made his way downstairs, and promptly ignored the party, instead looking to grab a drink and perhaps set out on his own. I decided on the fly to introduce a Team-Rocket-esque trio of bad guys, a local gang/party: Richard Hedd (human fighter), Beatrice Chtits (human rogue) and Ars faes (dwarf fighter). Richard spots the Cleric hanging around on his own, and notices his half-elven features. Spotting a chance to be a tool, Richard goes over and starts to make insulting small-talk. This was, of course, GM attempt to perhaps instigate a fist-fight of sorts to bring the party together against a racist idiot. Instead, the Cleric scares the trio off with a sacred flame...there goes that plan.\n\nThe Cleric moves to investigate the local quest/job list. Finding an escort mission, he decides to take the job and goes out the back to seek the wagon-driver by the name of Faen. The nervous driver states that he'd rather feel safer with a larger group to protect him and the Cleric leaves (Here I was thinking that I could give the Cleric a new party to work with for now, and then could join him back with the rest later.) The others at the table go to the stables and meet the wagoneer, who asks if they're also looking to escort him. They say that they are, and upon his mention of the Cleric to whom he promised the job, they set back into the tavern where the Druid persuades (see: annoyed) the Cleric into joining back up with them.  \nThe party is back together!\n\n-----\n\nOn the road, the party makes a little small talk with Faen, an older man with a rather reedy and nasal voice. They pretty much fall in love with him (one of my prouder character moments so far). As they come to a bridge over a ditch, a man dressed in obvious bandit clothing with a red bandanna climbs out of the ditch and halts the wagon. After a tense standoff, the Cleric makes his way around from the back of the wagon. Forgoing any sense of surprise, he brazenly walks out to the front of the wagon, dragging his quarterstaff behind him like the intentionally edgy anime protag. that he is. After a curt exchange, the Cleric goes to attack the bandit, starting the combat.  \n(*This is where one of the ruling questions comes in. As GM I concluded that as he was clearly standing right in front of the bandit, with a weapon out, then he did not get a surprise attack on him. The Cleric player disagreed, but went with my ruling after some talk. Was this a fair assessment?*) \n\nAn intense combat followed. Five bandits vs four party members and one scared wagon driver. The Rogue's stat unbalance really came into play, and he did get a large proportion of the kills, although he was also taken down in one crit hit by a crossbow bolt. A real glass cannon.\n\nIn the end the party triumphed. The final kill went to the Druid, and inspired by critical role I indulged in a How Do You Want To Do This? This resulted in the final bandit having her neck snapped fully around by a Thorn Whip, lovingly described by yours truly. The Cleric and the Rogue looted a pair of small crossbows from some bandits, and the Warlock took the leader'd bandanna as a trophy. The Cleric then decided that the best thing to do would be to pile up the bodies at the side of the road. (Some sort of warning to other bandits? I don't know what was going through his mind, or if it was just some strange act he thought up for the lulz.)\n\nHaving rid themselves of the threat, the party moved on to the next town over, Albridge. There they parted ways from Faen, who thanked them heartily and sent them off with their monetary reward. Most of the group went to the local tavern, hastily named the Ram's Arse. After some table banter, it transpired that it was actually a gay bar. Funnily enough, I was the last person to get the joke about the inn's name. Meanwhile the rogue went shopping and purchased himself a nice set of black clothes and some leather armour, using up pretty much all of his meagre coin in the process. After some discussion, the party realised that they could return to the original town and shack up at the Golden Braid again. The offer of the room still stood. This time, the party had formed enough of a cohesion that the Cleric deigned to share his room with the Druid. He still took the bed, and she was forced to gather leaves from outside and make herself yet another leaf bed, this time *indoors*.  \nAnd so the party awaited the next day.\n\n-------\n\nWhile things did not go quite as disastrously as last time, I decided that perhaps I should upload my sessions anyway. There are almost always some silly moments included thanks to my friends. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this next instalment, and you might look forward to the next stories, including the clearing out of a goblin band from a farm, and the liberating of a noble's manor from a mysterious evil force.\n\nThank you for your time!",

        "text": "So our party’s campaign went for about a year and a half, and we started out expecting to be the heroes of legend. Things went wrong so, so fast. Over the course of the campaign we (these are important)\n\n*Caused a civil war between the dark elves and Nagaji (snake men) that almost split the party, and destroyed a country.\n\n*Chose to leave some of the only surviving halflings in the world to stay in their holes right next to a bunch of murder hungry orcs. (The same ones we allied with btw)\n\n*Slaughtered an innocent group of mushroom men that were trying to help our injured friend because we couldn’t tell if they were going to help or kill him.\n\n*Killed all of the elves. All of them. They were outnumbered and about to lose to a chaotic corrupting force of beastmen, so we helped a crazy Druid do a spell to kill all of the beastmen and cleanse the corruption that covered most of the forest by sacrificing the elves. Half elves got very sick and many died or became part tree.\n\nMind you, we tried to be the good guys. We just had bad rolls, bad luck, and so, so many bad decisions. \n\nSo one of our last sessions involved is going north to help some gnomes and dwarves. After a very convoluted and almost messed up mission we helped gnomes coup two other violent possibly corrupted guilds and take over a city, and we went to the dwarves. We were stopped by a group of Npcs on the road. They asked “Are you Asalanin’s Chosen?” (We were, Asalanin is the king we served until in the civil war where part of our party killed him) We said we were, and they drew their weapons. We then looked at the party and we realized we were fucked. \n\nIn the party was a Nagaji Paladin, Dark elf rogue, Halfling bard, mushroom men summoner, and a half elf ranger. All of the races we “helped”. They told us we were under arrest, we drew our swords and got ready. It went real bad real quick. First turn our rogue got mind controlled by their bard, and our hunter put a cloud of fog in the middle of the battlefield in order to stop their ranger. This backfired as it gave their summoner cover to summon a lot of scary shit and take no damage from our ranger or hunter. And our party’s newest character, a bard, went to the other side pretending to betray us and do a double agent, but got killed immediately. The summoner summoned a giant spider that ripped the armor off of the tank, me, the party tank, half orc paladin. Our rogue took down our ranger, and slowly they advanced and subdued us. That, plus the following court trial, made us realize we really, really were not the heroes of legend we hoped we were. ",

        "text": "This happened about a year ago when I joined the Shadowrun group of a few friends. They had been playing their characters for quite a while and they convinced me to join as they were currently in the planning phase for a new run and needed some accomplices. I ended up leaving the group due to time constraints, but it was one of the most bonkers adventures I've played to date.\n  \nLet me introduce you to the gang:  \n  \n* The face, who was essentially Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad  \n* The decker, a dwarf who spent most of the time lying on the couch and communicating entirely through text messages.  \n* The rigger, another dwarf filled to the brim with high-end cyberware and currently saving up to buy a helicopter.  \nBoth dwarves had negative essence and were generally socially inept.  \n* The shapeshifting Shaman, a deeply relaxed orc whose spirit animal was a koala. He constantly smoked eucalyptus and shape-shifted into various marsupials (pouches, dude!)  \n* And finally my character, a paranoid Russian orc street-doc.  \n  \nThe job was simple enough: steal two massively valuable cyberdecks. They were produced in Australia, transported to Sydney airport on a heavily fortified convoy, flown to Vancouver on a private jet and then transported on another military-grade convoy to a bank where it would be integrated into some larger machine. After that point it would be impossible for us to get hold of it. I joined the group after they had already spent several sessions doing extensive reconnaissance and planning and after I joined them we again spent several sessions with extensive reconnaissance and planning. The results were grim: breaking into the bank wasn’t going to work and attacking the vehicle convoys also wasn’t a possibility as we were no combat-focused group. So we came to the conclusion that the only sensible thing to do was to hijack the plane from Sydney to Vancouver.  \n  \nNow that we had a plan, we could start preparing. In a spectacular matrix heist, our decker managed to get hold of the cargo manifest of the plane and we found out that besides our cyberdecks the jet would also transport several Australian para-critters bound for the Vancouver zoo. On board would be one courier, an Australian vet, two pilots and an unknown number of security guards.  \n  \nOur plan was the following:  \nWe kidnap the vet (who was essentially Crocodile Dundee) and our face assumes his identity. He boards the plane together with the shaman. The shaman gets aboard in the form of a dingo. During the flight, the face would slip a laxative into the drink of the courier, forcing her to run to the toilet. The toilet seat was treated with a narcotic so that when the courier sat down she would immediately fall unconscious. The face would then slip into the toilet behind a wall of illusion put up by the shaman so nobody else would see. The face would then hack the lock of the courier’s security briefcase, take out the cyberdecks and replace them with a counterweight. After that, the face would leave again. The shaman would then shapeshift into a Canada goose (because, as we found out, they can fly at the altitude of an airplane without major problems), slip into a custom-made harness that can hold the cyberdecks and escape through the cargo bay door shortly before landing and meet up with the decker and the rigger who had chartered a fishing boat and would be waiting for the goose. The face would excuse himself after landing, quickly change clothes and identity in a bathroom stall and conveniently disappear before anyone got suspicious.  \nAnd to our surprise, everything actually worked! Our countless hours of overthinking the plan actually worked. Nobody could quite believe it, I think\n  \nBut on our journey, there were too many amazing events to tell them all. I’ll try to give you a few short tidbits:  \n  \n* We were worried, that airport staff would be suspicious, that one dingo went missing during the flight. That’s when the legendary phrase was uttered “Our Best case scenario would be a portable dead dingo.”  \n* My doc was in charge of mixing the narcotic and laxative and I thought it would be a good idea to try them out on the face… so one morning I poisoned his coffee. Everything worked exactly as intended, but the rest of the session we had to spend convincing the face that he should stick around and not kill the doc.  \n* In Australia, we travelled in two rented camper vans. One luxurious version that cost more than a house for the face and the shaman, and one that was barely able to drive and constantly filled by a terrible stench. As we later found out, the rotting remains of a kangaroo where stuck behind the fridge.  \n* One day while working on their computer, the GM’s girlfriend asked him in a slightly concerned voice: “Honey, why is there a document called aircraft hijacking on our pc?”  \n* Before getting on the plane, the face had to spend one day masquerading as vet at the animal shelter where “Crocodile Dundee” worked. Hilarity ensued when he received a phone call, asking him to treat “Jenny.”  (“So… does she look… unhealthy?” “Hahahaha, good joke, Doc!” Turns out, Jenny was an invisible lizard)  \n* We thought we had done a pretty good job at not harming any one, until the GM reminded us that in a few days, the real Vet would wake up. In an unfamiliar room of a cheap motel in Sydney, tied to an armchair with an i.v. drip of an unknown substance in his arm and an oxygen mask on his face and the last thing he would remember were that lovely gay human/orc couple he and his family had had over for dinner. And after a few months maybe he would figure out, that he got horribly, horribly mind raped. And that a stranger had assumed his identity to for a heist. And to fuck his wife.  ",

        "text": "An ancient, abandoned temple, full of dangers, traps, and puzzles, in a valley populated by great monsters of a bygone age.\n\nA treasure map, leading to a previously-hidden entrance. \n\nA party, thrown together by fate and circumstance:\n\nA grippli net-fighter, far from home. Prone to getting bored and exploring without the rest of the party noticing.\n\nA vishkanya gunslinger, ex-slave with a vengeful temper and serious skills.\n\nA merfolk, who through judicious use of Oracular magic, feats, social skills, and illusions, has thus far given little indication in-character of being anything but a human cripple who can do magic.\n\nAnd me, a tiefling wizard with aspirations to infernal power.\n\nWe'd been exploring for most of the in-game day, and made it through a surprisingly small portion of the dungeon our DM had set before us. Which is not to say that we didn't get much done, more that the place was really frickin big and chock full of traps with a hearty sprinkling of zombies. \nOne of the things we'd run across was a fountain. It detected of healing magic and a Sanctuary effect around it, so we took note and didn't think more of it at the time.\n\nSome time later, a Derro showed up. After successfully not killing it (it caught the Vishkanya sneaking up on it and opened fire with a repeating crossbow; the hard part was keeping the gunslinger from killing it. Fortunately our party face is very…..convincing) and finding a common language that it was willing to speak (It was annoyed/scared and refused to speak Common, so we had to translate Sylvan through the grippli) we convinced it we were friendly enough (none of us had encountered Derro before) and that we would help it get back home. After that we more or less left it alone, intending to go back and lead it home after finding the passage it described coming through.\n\nAs we continued exploring, the grippli wandered off because we were taking too long in conversation with a talking statue that, in his words, “obviously didn't know anything.\" He ran across the Derro's gear near the fountain, and....a baby Derro. After calling the rest of the party, it was quickly decided that further testing was needed, and for some reason no one wanted to try it on the baby again. (Did I mention this was not exactly a good-aligned party?) \n\nTieflings being the longest-lived of the races present, and much longer than Derro, I was chosen as the guinea pig. As I took the plunge, or the drink as it were, the DM rolled a D100 in plain view and told me I was instantly 90 years younger.\n \nNow I got really worried. Tieflings live a long time, but how old exactly was I? I’d never figured out an exact number. If this effect was permanent there was a good chance I'd end up a child for the rest of the game, if not completely unplayable or just dead. \nA couple of rolls for age later, I turned out to be... 108. Exactly old enough for the water to put me in my prime again.\nIt turned out to be a fountain of youth designed for reptilian races, for whom it would extend their lifespans and allow them to continue growing in the manner of the greater dragons (and didn’t de-age the scalies for whom it was designed). Fancy, but also risky for any other race save the most long-lived. I, on the other hand, think the stuff is great. We already have a waterskin and two bottles of it in case something happens to the temple and we have to abandon the fountain.",

Rogue, you try to circle around and get on his side, Cleric, you get ready to back up Fighter, Fighter...wait, where the hell is Fighter?”\n\n&gt;Fighter strides up to the Stranger\n\n&gt;Stranger is cradling his arm under his tunic and limping as if injured. Some bloodstains are obvious against his tunic\n\n&gt;”Ho there! We were attacked by a madman! My entire team was slaughtered. Can you help me get to the next village? He might strike at any time!”\n\n&gt;Fighter is getting closer and closer; now within about 10 feet of the stranger\n\n&gt;Wait, is that an axe strapped on his back?\n\n&gt;Wizard begins to shout out a warning\n\n&gt;The Stranger leaps forwards, revealing a glowing knife in his “injured” hand that was hidden inside his tunic\n\n&gt;Leaps at Fighter...\n\n&gt;...which is when Fighter runs him through with the long knife (practically a small sword) he was holding behind him\n\n&gt;Party all have wut faces\n\n&gt;Short scuffle ensues, which ends with the Stranger being run through multiple times\n\n&gt;Apparently it's really hard to fight when you've been run through with a blade\n\nAs a sidenote, the warning about Ivan the Mad was, in real time, several hours of playing ago. Also, the Gm (hi) was pretty well known for leaving red herrings all over the place. The party had mostly either forgotten about Ivan the Mad or assumed he was another random potential quest that never came to fruition. \n\n&gt;Party was shocked\n\n&gt;Upon inspection, it was clear that this guy is Ivan the Mad\n\n&gt;Glowing green dagger, axe, and obviously wearing clothes from a bunch of guys killed with said weapons\n\n&gt;Everybody was congratulating Fighter on figuring it out before anybody else\n\n&gt;”So how did you figure out it was Ivan the Mad?”\n\n&gt;”Who?”\n\n&gt;Silence\n\n&gt;No more congratulations\n\n&gt;Party moves on quickly\n\n&gt;Guardmen's face goes even more ashen than normal and he speaks even less\n\n\nSo there it is folks, the story of how a random act of murderhoboing actually saved the party instead of the opposite.

Elders from each village were gathering their people together in preparation to evacuate the island. That very act was a testimony to how desperate the situation had become; as far as any of them knew, Tirkosu was the only landmass in the whole vast ocean. True, there were tales about the far off Dragonlands, but those were little more than fisherman's legends.\n\nThe ten protectors of the elements gathered together at Hepthurai. Flamer flew back from Karu Sampur after leading his Warforged kin to a safe location. Inalak brought Jaques and Tikka on the flying tower, the latter having agreed to fight despite the danger it posed to her unborn children. Lundal was fetched by Turf. She was still shell-shocked after having to kill her brother, but she snapped out of it when she saw her friend still moping about his fight club. \n\nHe was still hung up about the genie wish he'd refused. Although his depression was well excused at the start, it was a long time since that particular incident. He was wallowing in self pity, and Turf let him know it. They had a pretty big shouting match, but eventually Lund agreed to fight alongside his friends one last time. Turf's raging had lit a fire beneath him. She'd literally just lost a family member she thought was long gone, and did he see her giving into grief? No. Turf was going to continue the fight and save the world. And if the past held her back from that goal, then it could be damned. \n\nSo Lundal, protector of steam, once more suited up to stand tall with the Tsethem. They had two means of transport, namely the flying tower and the last remaining airship. Lund had been keeping the latter in a secret cave below Little Orthraze, while he worked to reproduce the Elemental Propulsion Engine. Now was the perfect time to put it into action again. The villagers wanted to use the vehicles to escape the island, but the Tsethem's plan also relied on them. It was a gamble: either use them to help the villagers escape and definitely doom the island, or use them in their plan and potentially save the whole world. And the odds were low in favor of the Tsethem's victory.\n\nDespite that, they managed to talk the elders into giving them a chance. Flamer had spied the Archomentals crossing the gulf between the mainland and the volcano. It wasn't long before they'd reach Tiamat's temple. The party from Barovia asked if they could help in the fight, and their aid was gladly accepted. They boarded the airship along with the Tsethem, except Lundal and Inalak; they took the flying tower and lingered away from the main team. Vind's plan hinged on them staying put until needed. The rest of them sailed out over the clouds, heading towards their foes. \n\nThis was the biggest battle I'd ever run. I actually went the traditional route, and used some minis on a battlemap. The scale of the fight, the amount of combatants, the insane difficulty... It deserved a 3d representation. I was pitting sixteen player characters against three end-game bosses. It was the battle that defined Tirkosu. It was elemental protectors against elemental evil. The final struggle against the Elder Eye's most powerful servants. All in all, the combat took a whole day to resolve. \n\nThey were extremely close to arriving to late. Vanella crashed the airship into the rocky plateau on which Tiamat's temple stood just as the the Archomentals were heading through the exterior gateway. Olhydra and Yan-C-Bin hung back to delay the heroes while Ogremoch lumbered toward the temple's centre. The towering spires of water and air rushed towards them, and the battle began. \n\nIt was marvelous, seeing them all work together again. The first rounds were blessed with some of the best rolls I've seen. The group from Pernep worked almost seamlessly with the Tsethem. Angelica sliced away at Olhydra with her sunsword while Kilmorn stunned the crushing wave into inaction. Jaques and Della powered into Yan-C-Bin, their weapons moving so fast that they managed to counter his swirling winds. Vindicus stood alongside Callie on the deck of the ruined airship, as both shot arrows and blasts of eldritch power into their enemies from afar. It looked like it was going to be a cakewalk. \n\nAnd then the luck turned. Yan-C-Bin blasted his surroundings with a thunderous tornado, instantly dropping Vanella and Tikka. Flamer was beaten out of his mechanical scorpion form. Olhydra grabbed Kilmorn and filled his lungs with water. The prince of air and princess of water had unleashed their full power on the heroes, and it was devastating to watch. They both stood back to back, laughing at their pathetic opponents. \n\nIt was the perfect set up. \n\nLundal smashed into the ground in front of Olhydra, the magic in his exosuit cushioning the fall. He grinned at her through goggled eyes before blasting away with his cannon arm, and freezing a good potion of her solid. His other arm powered into her, the force of the blow combined with the sudden tangibility causing her to topple back into Yan-C-Bin. \n\nLundal turned and walked away, the orange sunset glinting off his mech. \n\n\"Sweet dreams, princess.\"\n\nThe tower exploded behind him. Traveling downwards at an insane speed, the two Archomentals never stood a chance. Lund had aimed it perfectly above the two, then cut the EPE's power. Both Olhydra and Yan-C-Bin were crushed beneath its gargantuan weight as Inalak slowly descended to stand with the other Tsethem. Not even the Primordials would be able to stand such a terrific impact. \n\nVind's strategy had paid off, but the fight wasn't over. Ogremoch had reached the centre of the temple and was beginning the ritual to summon Tiamat. Flamer grabbed Turf and Della, flying at an arm-wrenching speed across the plateau. They arrived within seconds, but Turf was the first to recover. She told the others to stay back; this was her fight. \n\nOf all the evil Archomentals, Turf hated Ogremoch the most. In her eyes he was a stain on earthenkind. He was unworthy of the title \"elemental prince\". And she was going to take him down. She hefted her giant blade and charged. \n\nEarth met earth. The sheer power of both combatants was incredible to watch. Their blows shook the foundation of the temple. Each thunderous swing of Turf's weapon would tear chunks of rock off Ogremoch. Every slam of his fist crushed her into the ground. Any lesser being would have been pulverized. But a change had come over Turf; she was at one with her element, more so than ever before. She was true earth. This \"prince\" was simply a corrupted imitation. \n\nAnd he fell like so many others before him. The Ogremoch toppled backwards onto the temple's floor, vanquished by Megan Turf Bridgewater; true protector of earth. \n\n* * *\n\nThe wounded were healed up, and the dead resurrected. Tikka and Jaques had a horrific moment in which they found out that their babies had been killed from Yan-C-Bin's blast, but Flamer used one of his weapons (a golden sword named Render) to discreetly resurrect them all with a wish. The other Tsethem congratulated the team Vindicus had brought along. They'd made a gamble by joining what was essentially a suicide mission, but it had paid off; the island was safe once again. \n\nMessenger animals were sent out to the villages. Flamer used his magic to conjure up a banquet for the heroes. They ate beneath the multicolored stars of the night sky, telling tales and bonding. Turf found solace from her loss in the company of so many friends, as did Lundal. Flamer took Thane aside and had a chat about her mechanical nature. This was when Flamey really started showing his regal side. He'd always been a gentleman, but the words of wisdom and kindness he gave to the troubled girl really cemented him as a majestic but tender leader. They also stopped Thane from going completely nuts, now that the imminent threat to the world was over. \n\nDella was busy studying the voidblade used by Turf's brother. It was crafted from shadow in some kind of solid form, which would imply it was created in the plane of shadow. But the time-freezing properties it had were alien to that realm. Della assumed it was from a demiplane attached to the main shadow plane, one with its own rules and magical structure. It seemed like the perfect place for a certain evil being to hide. \n\nHis servants might have been vanquished, but the Elder Eye was still out there. Della had never been able to visit other planes without a portal tuner. But the voidblade was exactly what she needed to visit the Eye's personal demiplane. \n\nIt was time to being the fight to the one who had started it all. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nNext one's gonna be difficult to write. Might be a couple of days late, so apologies in advance.",

        "text": "*Carol lined up her shot through the arrow slit.  The adventurers would be punished in the name of her mighty Lord and Savior.*\n\nLife in the nunnery had been very formative for Carol.  Born within the holy grounds to a nun that had committed adultery, Carol was closely watched by the elders for any signs of trouble.  As she grew, however, they found that Carol was very obedient and well-behaved.  After Carol reached the age of 5, the elders let their supervision lapse, confident in the girl’s spirit.  She was ordered to be raised as a nun- surely a child born in the nunnery would become a saintly figure.\n\n*“Lord Asmodeus, in your unholy and perfect name, I damn these heretics to a sad death far from home.  Let this dungeon be their unmarked grave!”*\n\nCarol was raised by all the nuns, but a select few took a special interest in her.  They taught her about the truth behind Talingarde, about all the secret things that Mitra forbade.  They taught her of Asmodeus, the one true Lord.  Carol listened, and heard, and understood.  As she grew, so too did her love for her great lord Asmodeus.  Carol’s devotion led her to find her ultimate purpose in life- a plaything in the hands of her god, to do with as he pleased.\n\n*The first shot, a pheromone arrow, planted itself firmly in the man’s shoulder, marking him with Carol’s tracking scent.  There would be no escape for this heathen scum.*\n\nWith a clear heart and sound mind, Carol burned the mark of her god on her breast, just above her heart.  This secret mission guided her path through her formative years, as she waited patiently for her lord to take her and use her.  In the meantime, Carol honed her skills in archery and infiltration, learning the weaknesses of the Mitrans she walked amongst and to fool their alignment detection spells.\n\n*The man cursed and shouted a warning to his comrades.  “Arrow slits!  Form up!”  The sound of boots running down the hall echoed in the dark dungeon.*\n\nNot all evil things could last, however.  A man from the nearby town grew fond of Carol, and began waiting for her when she would make the trip to purchase supplies for the nunnery.  She refused his advances, saying that she was saving herself for her lord.  Despite his increasing pressure, Carol remained steadfast.\n\n*Carol readied her next shots, but was unable to fire them before the adventurers formed up in a tight group.  One of them shouted the words to a spell, with Carol just barely able to make out the incantation for* Dimension Door.\n\nOne day Carol didn’t see the man waiting for her.  Glad that he had come to his senses, she moved on, but was jumped from behind.  He tried to force her off the road, but Carol’s training kicked in, and she quickly incapacitated the man.  Enraged at the perceived hypocrisy of the Mitrans, she smuggled his body back to the nunnery and in the middle of the night used his blood to desecrate the shrine there.\n\n*Hearing the whoosh of air and magic behind her, Carol spun around in shock.  “What?”  The group of adventurers now stood assembled before her, weapons drawn and ready.  Carol’s breath left her, as the icy grip of fear took hold in her heart.*\n\nThough Carol hid his body, the Mitrans brought in a famed witch-hunter to investigate this great heresy, and he finally brought Carol’s crimes to light.  She was branded by the Mitrans and sent to Branderscar Prison, where she would be executed for her heresy against Mitra.  As she was dragged away, Carol couldn’t help but laugh at the stunned expressions of the nuns who had raised her.\n\n*The man Carol had shot earlier was the quickest to react, tumbling around behind her and flanking with the barbarian.  She hadn’t even the time to fire a shot before the man’s cold steel pierced her from behind.  A slight gasp was all Carol could muster.*\n\nThe events that surrounded her escape from Branderscar were fate, in her eyes.  Lord Asmodeus was not yet finished with her, she would not die yet.  And lo, the Ninth Knot was formed.  Together, they laid low the Mitrans and brought an army of monsters to pillage their countryside.  Carol knew this was her destiny.\n\n*Carol tried to call forth a spell to escape, but before she could complete it, the opposing sorcerer shot forth a ray of burning fire.  Carol’s eyes went wide as her heart was pierced through and consumed.*\n\nThe Ninth Knot took over an ancient, evil lair in the wilderness, calling forth a long-subdued evil to aid their Lord Asmodeus.  Things progressed smoothly, as they corrupted the land and its people.  Carol took charge of making their lair into a proper home, crafting traps and fortifying the defenses.  But once again, all evil things must come to an end…\n\n*No sound escaped Carol’s lips as she sank to her knees.  The man who she had shot kicked her down with one foot, and she landed roughly on her back.  The hole in her chest left the Star of Asmodeus on her breast exposed for all to see.*\n\nNightly raids began by a powerful, unseen force.  The Knot did their best to uncover the source and track them down, eventually learning the identity of their assailants.  When one of the Knot was captured by the enemy, the Knot wasted no time in attempting a rescue.  The rescue mission went horribly, and the Knot were forced to retreat.  The final challenge came when adventurers approached the dungeon, intent on clearing it of its inhabitants.\n\n*The man knelt down next to Carol, quickly and roughly searching her body for any valuables and taking them for his own.  “This one’s done,” said the man, “let’s find the rest and get this over with.”  The group departed, leaving Carol alone in the dark.*\n\n*“Lord Asmodeus…”*  Carol thought as she lay broken and dying on the cold dungeon floor.  All the events in her life that had led her to this point replayed in her mind, over and over.  *“Lord Asmodeus… was I not good enough…?”*  Carol’s thoughts turned to her dream in life- to be a plaything for her Lord.  She thought back to all the toys she had discarded as she grew up in the nunnery, and how carelessly they’d been cast aside for newer, better ones.\n\nA few tears began to leak out from Carol’s unfocused eyes.  *“Lord Asmodeus… I’m sorry… I’ll… do better...”*\n\n…\n\n*“Please… take me…”*\n\n=====\n\nDuring our journey through Way of the Wicked, our attendance started to decline, leading to a lack of key party members.  We decided to press on without them, and because of that we suffered a total party kill while defending the Horn of Abaddon.  After having invested so much time into the character and campaign, I had to find a better way for things to end, so I wrote a dramatized version of the events that lead to Carol's death.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.",

        "text": "Trigger warning: *Mobile formatting*\n\nSo in my last post, I mentioned how the group’s wizard had died, and threw in the line “never underestimate a vampire”. \n\nThis is the scene. The PCs has been defending a certain town since the story began - they had entered crypts, cleared out a monster infested forest, and killed a nest of dragon wyrmlings, all for these villagers. Now they had stormed the keep of a local tyrant lord and what do they find in his tiny dungeon? A vampire.\n\nNow the party was fairly low level, it would be full-on vampires if not for the risk of an easy TPK. So I used the vampire spawn stats, and STILL NEARLY GOT A TPK (mostly due to Chaotic stupid Ranger and Paladin) \n\nSo firstly, having interrogated the vampire spawn, the wizard insisted on just using one fire cantrip to kill it, and didn’t let anyone else attack the thing. \n\nAssuming max damage rolls and failed saves every time, it would take 54 seconds of in-game time to kill him. They had 2 minutes to get back to the village. I had no plans to allow the death of my lovingly crafted plot hooks- I mean villagers! \n\nSo I decided the vampires were crawling all the way to the village for the element of surprise! (Okay I kinda just needed the PCs to get hooked on other quests from the villagers) \n\nAnyway, once the wizard finishes roasting the vampire, the party faces a new dilemma - they need horses to get there in time, but there’s only 2 live horses and you guys - “I cast animate dead” \n\n“Wut?”\n\n“You said 2 live horses, so that means there are dead ones right?” \n\n......”there is a half eaten one that was vampire food”\n\n“Could it carry the halfling?” \n\nAnd then the Wizard flew whilst the others rode on horses. \n\nThe wizard arrives earlier than the others, who took a path through difficult terrain. And decides to try and solo the encounter which was the end of a chapter in the campaign. \n\nSo, he should die for his stupidity right? Wrong, because he flies up above them so they can’t hit him. \n\nThe rest of the party shows up after a few rounds of the wizard making puns and throwing spells. The encounter seems to be ending quite quickly. \n\nAngry DM decides to try some bullshit. \n\nThe vampires line up and they each prepare a reaction to pass the vampire to the next one in line. Result: 3 vampires launched at the wizard. They each get a multi attack on the way past, so end result - the wizard takes a lot of damage\n\nSo much so infact, he fails the concentration and falls, taking enough fall damage to be forced to make death saves. \n\nThe rest of the party dispatches almost all of the vampires - all but one, in-fact. \n\nThe last vampire grapples the Ranger. The Rogue, being a halfling, decides he’s going to slide between the Ranger’s legs then stab the vampire..... nat 1. No more Ranger babies, possibly no more Ranger since he’s now on death saves.....\n\nThe Rouge panics and stabs the vampire, and then the paladin jumps down a 30ft cliff to fall on/stab the vampire... the vampire is dead, but now there are 3 party members on death saves.\n\nLuckily, the paladin makes his saves and the Rogue gives him a healing potion and the paladin heals the Ranger. \n\nBut the wizard didn’t make it. \n\nI expected him to be upset, but all he said was: “Sweet, I wanted to make a new character anyway! Can I play a Dragonborn monk?” \n\n",

        "text": "We managed to assemble the entire party again, but was informed that our Gladiator may be switching to the night shift at work. No idea when this might happen or if he’ll be working on game night. Frankly, I’m insulted that he’d even consider putting his job ahead of a game. The nerve. /s\n\n**The Party:**\n\nDamien, the LG Paladin - Has a cool new sword and is ready to start smiting evil. Very good at playing the “Paladin of Vengeance” path he took at level 3. With him being the most experienced player in the group, I’m wondering if he’s got a nice story of “Vengeance leads to Hate leads to Suffering leads to the Dark Side” planned. \n\nLuvLock, the NN Warlock - Remembered that he has the ability to communicate telepathically. This allows him to make all of his snide comments and jokes in character without the NPCs hearing him. If this continues, it may lead to spontaneous bursts of laughter from the party at the least appropriate moments.\n\nMidir, the NG Gladiator - Continues to struggle with names, often with humorous results. Seems to have particular trouble remembering Ismark and Ireena and has taken to calling them [Marik and Ishizu Ishtar](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z4Z_fTBca68/hqdefault.jpg).\n\nSir Elvenbeard the Vast, the CN Pirate - Neglected to level up his character to level 3, despite having several weeks to do so. His punishment is that he’s still level 2. I’m curious about whether he remembers to level up for next week.\n\nSir Richard Burns, the LN Cleric - Still the quietest and most thoughtful of the party. As the Paladin slowly becomes more driven by vengeance, he is a voice of reason. He’s still against the minions of darkness, but argues for caution and planning.\n\nThis week started with the party leaving Barovia for the hopefully Strahd-free town of Vallaki. On the way, they took a shortcut that brought them past a camp of Vistani who urged the party to join them for a meal. The party was going to leave, but then one of the Vistani told them that Madam Eva had foretold their coming and would speak to them. Spooked and ready for a fight, the party met Madam Eva. She told their fortunes, giving vague hints about several treasures and an ally who could help them defeat Strahd. To Madam Eva’s surprise, the tarot cards revealed that one of the treasures was in the camp. At this reveal, she rushed out of the tent and went rampaging through the Vistani wagons looking for the treasure. I don’t know if you’ve seen *Howl’s Moving Castle*, but if you have you might remember the scene where [grandma Sophie](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9e/c9/a3/9ec9a309962bca3e7a5158576948d1ae.jpg) went on her cleaning frenzy. It was a bit like that. This unstoppable old woman barged into the wagons and tore through them looking for whatever the treasure might be. The party and the Vistani just sat there, slack-jawed. They didn’t know what to think. With a cry of triumph, Madam Eva emerged from one of the wagons with a sword held above her head. The hilt of the sword was normal, made out of some dark metal, but where the blade should have been was a beam of sunlight. It was, of course, the [Sunsword](https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/147100/assets/662333/sunsword.PNG?1478797464). She [presented the sword to the party](http://wheelhouseworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TakeThis.jpeg).The Pirate and Paladin argued over who should get the sword until it was pointed out that a) the Paladin was a force for good and the sun is a symbol of good so it fits thematically and b) the Pirate is a drow and drow hate the sun. The ownership of the sunsword decided, the party bid Madam Eva farewell and continued on to Vallaki. \n\nOnce they arrived in Vallaki, they headed to the Blue Water Inn where Ismark had rented a room for Ireena to stay in. Outside the inn, they saw several ravens. The Warlock decided it would be fun to try and communicate with them telepathically. After all, there are ravens in *The Hobbit* who can talk. This led to a humorous interlude where the ravens flocked to the Warlock and demanded corn from him. He fed them and more ravens flew down wanting corn. More ravens arrived wanted corn. So he fed them. Eventually he was surrounded by ravens all jumping up and down demanding corn. The rest of the party laughed and entered the inn. Unbeknownst to them though, the raven actually replied and instructed the Warlock to remain silent and wait for the raven to contact him that night. The innkeeper, ~~Steve~~ Urwin, welcomed the party and his wife got Ireena set up in her room. The party felt a sense of accomplishment at bringing Ireena to safety. Like this was an important *experience* or something. Their quest completed, they hit level 4 (except for the Pirate, who wasn’t level 3 yet). While they were waiting for Ireena to get settled, they asked Urwin about any rumors or things to see around town. He direct them to several places and told them a bit of news, like how there was a circus in town. Before they left, Ismark asked to join the party. He wanted to help them fight Strahd. The Paladin and Cleric agreed because they could use help fighting against the darkness. The Warlock and Pirate agreed because they wanted to use him as a meatshield. The Gladiator agreed because he thought Ireena was hot and didn’t realize that it was Ismark asking to join, not Ireena. That settled, they went to the circus.\n\nThe circus really more of a carnival. Well, I say carnival. It was a rough semi circle comprised of a tent, a couple carts, and a game set up in the space between some warehouses. The tent was advertised as Rictavio’s House of Wonder!!! with three exclamation marks. The party paid one gold each to gain entrance and “Bear Witness to the Strangest Sights in All Barovia!” They saw The World’s Largest Prairie Dog which was actually a medium sized capybara, Ruth the Bearded Woman who looked more like a man in drag, A Real Mermaid which was most likely a dead monkey with its legs chopped off and replaced by a fish tail, and Sven the Boy Who Breathes Fire who wasn’t actually there. Their minds filled with wonder, they went to the next area to play the high striker game. Everyone tried and got results like “wee babby” and “feeble old person” until the Gladiator stepped up, rolled a nat 20 on his strength, and rang the bell. There was no prize associated with ringing the bell besides the knowledge that he had the strength of a god.\n\nThe last thing at the carnival was a wagon that bore the sign “Rictavio’s Carnival of Wonders.” As they approached, the party heard scratching and growling coming from the wagon and it shook slightly. Two humans, a man and a woman, stepped around from the side of the cart and told the party to leave. The Pirate approached them and asked if the wagon was a store. No, the man replied, it wasn’t.     \nThen what was it? he asked. A carnival wagon.     \nWhat’s inside? We don’t know.     \nThen why are you guarding it? We were paid to do so.     \nCan I look inside? No.     \nWhat if I paid you? Then we’d take you money and not let you look in. Now you need to leave.     \nThe Pirate must have been a Hollywood movie exec in a past life, because he wasn’t taking no for an answer. He strode forward and reached out for the door to the wagon. This action, somewhat predictably, resulted in the guards attacking him. The Gladiator rushed in and pull the Pirate away before he was injured and the party left before the guards were called. The session ended with the party looking for a store to sell some things and restock on supplies. \n\nAnother good session and happily everyone could be there. Ismark will be taken over by one of the players and they’ll get instructions on how to play him. They’ve got some more goodies to discover in Vallaki and the Warlock has the mystery of the talking raven. And on top of all of this, Madam Eva’s fortune told of two more treasures and a mysterious ally who could help them. All won’t be revealed ~~next week~~ tomorrow since Destiny 2 DLC is apparently more important that roleplaying, so perhaps they’ll learn more the week after. If they manage to survive, that is. \n",

Kilmorn and Pekeski were training in the field out back.  Angelica was taking an afternoon stroll, and Elo was helping Thane fix a broken clock. Everything was peaceful, idyllic, calm. \n\nThe Mirlings came swiftly and silently, flitting through the piney trees like the shadows from which they'd come. The small farms towards the edge of the planestable zone were the first to be hit, and soon the screams of the villagers brought the heroes' attention. Angelica grabbed her sunsword and Thane donned her gauntlets. The Mirlings closed in further, setting fire to thatched roofs as they went. \n\nJust as confrontation was imminent, a figure clad in familiar black armor appeared from the opposite side of the village. The Vindicus had returned. Dark cloak billowing like smoke, he drew his blade and sped towards the invaders with blinding speed. The others took that as the signal and charged along with him. \n\nThe battle was long and grueling. There were six characters of about seventh level and one of roughly ten, against around two hundred Mirlings. I actually ended up coding a combat manager to do the heavy lifting for me. Mirling aren't all that dangerous on their own, but together they posed a very real threat. They were similar to zombies in that regard, with the mindlessness replaced by fanatic fervor.\n\nThe team took down half of the horde until they were forced to retreat due to their injuries. Most of the carnage was thanks to Vind, who's demonic gifts allowed him to regain some health every time he killed someone. But even a demon-fueled rage machine eventually runs out of steam, and he had to escape with the others into the extradimensional space Vanella conjured up. \n\nThey waited until the Mirlings had moved on, then reentered the regular world and snuck off into the forest. They were all pretty badly banged up, especially the less combat-oriented members. It was at this point that Mythic indicated for a random event to occur.\n\nI've talked about pivot points before, where a single moment changes the whole course of the game, the narrative, and the characters' lives. Tiseo's reveal was one, as was Pekeski's creation by the deck of many things. This random event would turn out to be another. \n\nI was listening to music, as I usually do while in session. The song I playing at the time was Shatter Me by Lindsey Stirling. Violin dubstep sounds so wrong on paper, but it's so right in practice. This song... This one song irreparably changed the tale of Tirkosu forever. \n\nI rolled the random event: PC Negative. \n\nI rolled to see which character it would affect: Vanella. \n\nI rolled to see what the event meaning was; \"deception of reality\". \n\nThe powerful beat drops and mournful violin thundered in my headphones as it all clicked into place. Shatter Me is a song about a wind up mechanical doll trying to feel emotions. I couldn't ignore such an insane coincidence. The virtual DM was pointing every finger it had in one direction. \n\n* * *\n\nVanella Thane stumbled to a halt at the outskirts of Pernep's planestable zone. She was holding one hand under her arm; a Mirling had managed to slice through her gauntlet, cutting deeply into her little finger and nearly removing it completely. But the sight of blood wasn't the thing making her heart clench up in terror. It wasn't the pain making her normally blank eyes wild and panicked. It was what lay below the flesh, that was currently sticking out in plain view thanks to the injury. \n\nCogs. Gears. Pistons and pipes. Coils of wire and energy crystals. Tiny magitek devices sticking out of her mutilated finger.\n\nShe was a machine. \n\n* * *\n\nI was experiencing similar shock as she was. I'd created Thane to be a relatively normal person. She was the tiny deadpan counterpart to Elo's hulking robotic. But the vDM seemed intent on messing with her backstory, as first he'd taken away her parents and then he'd decided she was some kind of hyperrealistic synthetic human. I was stunned, and brimming with questions: how? Why? Who? Thane's memories were messed up as it were, so I doubted I'd get the answers anytime soon. \n\nAnd Thane herself... She was distraught. Imagine for a moment that you were going about your daily business, doing work or enjoying your hobbies (or in Thane's case, fighting a hide of monsters). And then suddenly, you get hurt pretty badly. But instead of seeing muscle and bone beneath the blood, you discover cogs and pipes. Imagine how gut-wrenchingly terrifying that would be. Everything you thought you knew about yourself would be a lie. You couldn't even trust if your own thoughts were real. It's the ultimate blend of physical and psychological horror. And the impact it had on Thane was truly an experience to roleplay, especially given how calm and unemotional I'd played her up until then. \n\nElo found her a few moments later. Vind's demon had showed up, and they were trying to bargain with him for a quick teleport to the Tsethem tower. Thane showed Elo her wound and shakily asked him if he knew. He told her yes, and said how sorry he was; he couldn't have let her know about it, due to the orders of her parents and his mental inhibitors. He wished that hadn't been the case. But now she knew, he promised to help her find out more, promised that he could show her where it all started. He was her friend, forever. And he was sorry.\n\nThane gave him a hug. And for the first and last time in her life, she shed a tear.\n\n* * *\n\nThe flashbacks had been visiting Thane's dreams all year. \n\nA sharp exploding bang awoke her. Sounds of laughter, singing, and far off music. Something was covering her. A sack? She rolled out of it and took in her surroundings.\n\nShe was in Orthraze, before its fall. There was no mistaking those tall spires and domed roofs, visible even from the murky alleyway she was currently lying in. The night sky was lit up with color as another bang cut through the air. Fireworks. The people were celebrating. \n\nTurning on the spot, she spied a hulking silver man standing at the alley's exit with his glowing green eye upturned to the stars. The name Elo floated through her mind. Short for Eloquent, which was ironic. Why was it ironic? It felt like she should know, but didn't. She clumsily walked over to him and watched the fireworks explode for a minute.\n\nThane: Why're they doin' that? Explodin' stuff, I mean.\n\nElo: They do so for enjoyment.\n\nThane: But why though...\n\nElo: (*Pauses*) Elo does not know. It is likely to celebrate the end of the war. Elo does not understand the concept of celebration.\n\nThane: Oh... So there's a war, huh? (*rubs the back of her head*) Listen, uh... This is gonna sound kinda weird, but... Who 'zactly am I?\n\nElo: Mistress is Vanella, of Thane. Elo has been ordered to protect you by Mistress' parents. \n\nThane: (*Pauses*) Alrighty. So, where're my pierants? \n\nElo: They are gone. \n\nThane: Oh. Were they... Killed in the war? \n\nElo: Affirmative. \n\nThane: Who by? Who're they even fightin' 'gainst? \n\nElo: (*Pauses*) Elo does not know.\n\nThane: M'kay.\n\n* * *\n\nThane had been experiencing lots of dreams, enough to patch together a vague idea of what was going on. Since her earliest memory of waking up in Orthraze, she and Elo had scrounged a living on the streets as arcane mechanics. Eventually they earned enough to rent out a small shop, but before the deal closed there was the whole elemental cultists scare. The bombing of Rahg Krahv caused quite the stir in Orthraze, and many of its inhabitants decided to move to less populated villages in the hope that they'd be less of a target. Thane and Elo were among those who moved down to Pernep. Over time she'd forgotten that her parents were gone, due to remnants of her \"amnesia\". But since Strahd opened up her mind, remnants of the past were starting to push through.\n\nThane's revelation was amazing. It was a pivot point of the greatest magnitude. It opened up so many possibilities, and so many questions. But there was one matter in particular that overshadowed all the rest, a question that I needed to know as a player instead of a character. \n\nWhen using Mythic it's nice to keep some aspects of world building vague, so you can fill in the gaps as and when. I did this a lot with Tirkosu. Hells, I didn't even have a map of the island when I started playing. But all the vagueries were cleared up when they were needed. All except one.\n\nI asked the vDM a question, one I needed to know the answer of. Was it simply a meta vagueness? Or was there more to it? I asked, and the result was mind-numbingly shocking.\n\nThe Great War was a year-long, catastrophic event. Half the island's population had been wiped out. The Warforged had been created to win the battles that their flesh and blood creators could never hope to. Everyone on the island knew about the Great War. \n\n*And nobody knew who they'd been fighting against.*\n\nRecords. Countless documents of battles, massacres, and triumphs. Veterans who'd talk about airship raids and charges alongside Warforged. And not one of them, not a single one mentioned who the actual enemy was. \n\nAnd no one cared. It was as if it was a blind spot in everyone's memory, something they knew affected the world and things it was linked to, but that they couldn't quite focus on enough to realize what the thing actually was. Asking direct questions about who the enemy had been would be met with an angry brush off. No one wanted to think about the enemy. It was as though they had never existed.\n\nThis. Absolutely. Terrified me. There's been a lot of scary stuff in Tirkosu; the scene where Flamer found his friends' corpses after the shadow dragon had nailed them to the wall, the creepy fungus in the dark mirror, and of course, the realization that Thane was a machine. But nothing came close to this. To know that there was something so, fundamentally *wrong* with the world, and to have zero idea why that was... It was goosebump-inducing.\n\nAnd it was absolutely glorious for the possibilities it opened up.\n\n* * *\n\nThane didn't know that the world was broken. No one did. They were were all in the same fug of ignorance that extended across the whole island, and perhaps even further. But now wasn't the time to start questioning reality. An army of Mirlings had just summoned the three most dangerous beings known to history onto the lands, and an apocalypse was most likely imminent. Vindicus finally got his demon patron to warp them to the rest of the Tsethem, and had an awkward moment explaining to Naliko where he'd been all this time. Vanella was in shock, but stable enough to focus on the problem at hand: stopping the Archomentals.\n\nDella asked her god for some guidance, and he delivered with a vision of what Ogremoch and Co. were trying to achieve. They were headed from the temple of Tiamat and were intending to use their combined powers to summon her. I didn't understand why, at the time. But regardless of the reason, summoning the living weapon meant death for the inhabitants of Tirkosu. \n\nThe Archomentals were threatening the island. And the Tsethem weren't just going to stand by and watch. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nSome serious psychological craziness in this time. It'll all make sense eventually, but it took them (and me) a fair few months to figure it out, and uncover the pieces of the puzzle. ",

For Pekeski and Angelica it was a rather new experience. The temperate climate of Pernep was very different to the gloom of Barovia, and the two newcomers enjoyed it greatly. A year and six months had passed since the rise of the dragon cult, and everything on the island was running smoothly. Even the Mirling raids had quieted down, to the point where farmers didn't need to hire mercenaries for protection any more. \n\nIt was time for the virtual DM to kick things into gear again. The scene was Mt. Tirkosu, upon which resided the ice-bound Golath tribe. Most of them lived inside a large fortified village near the topmost peak, but there were a few settlements dotted around the mountain. It was in one such place that Naliko Lakumathala found herself. As Tsethem of Ice she had a duty to protect her people, and that also meant visiting the sick and needy. She was accompanied by Flamer, who was also competent at healing thanks to his time studying with the secretive druids. \n\nThey visited a few settlements and dealt with everyday problems such as ravenous wolves and demonic goats. The former were easy to deal with thanks to a new friend of Nali's: one of the wolves from the pack she'd grown up in, who she called Winterbrough. They finally arrived at the last cabin and checked up on the Golath woman living there. She was grateful that they'd come, but also seemed worried. She told them that only just yesterday, a Mirling had stumbled into her yurt with a dagger in his back. The creature seemed to be too injured to pose any real threat, so she tended to his wounds and gave him some food. \n\nFlamer healed up the Mirling enough to allow him to regain consciousness while Naliko inspected the dagger. The hilt was decorated with the same reptilian eye symbol that seemed to be cropping up everywhere. The Milton's story confirmed it; the Elder Eye was back, and looking for vengeance. \n\nHe explained in broken elvish that there was much disturbance in the dark mirror. A powerful Human claiming to be a prophet of the Elder Eye had rallied the head Mirlings under his cause. They were gathering an army with the intent of launching an attack on the surface world, one that would herald the coming of the Eye. \n\nFlamer didn't take him at face value. Interactions with Mirlings in the past hadn't gotten much better than blood curdling screams as they attacked. The islanders generally regarded them as slightly more dangerous goblins; mindless creatures who lived for violence. And yet here was this one, not only communicating properly but also trying to help us. It seemed like a trap. \n\nBut it wasn't. When he was brought to the Tsethem tower and interrogated by Korena, he passed every magical test she threw his way. Flamer was intrigued, and asked him about the attack on Orthraze. Apparently the Mirlings had been following orders from their god, the Elder Eye; he had commanded them throughout the years via a prophet, the latest of which was organising the latest attack. The captured Mirling didn't know why the Eye had told them to switch sides with Imix, back at the fall of Orthraze. His people didn't question the orders of their god, they just followed them blindly. \n\nFlamer was certain that their informant was telling the truth. He traveled to Sovu Vapohu and asked Turf to summon the Tsethem together once again. Unfortunately that wasn't so simple. Lundal was still mooching about his fight club, brooding about the genie's wish. The Torrems had spent a couple of weeks in the feywild, and Tikka had somehow gotten pregnant with quadruplets. And Vindicus was still hanging out with those defective druids, high off his head on dreamroot. \n\nThe remaining seven followed their guide and headed into the dark mirror through a tunnel in the side of Mt. Tirkosu. Small fissures, craters, and chasms all appear regularly on the surface, staying for a few days before being healed over by the planar flow. These cracks form the gateways through which Mirlings enter onto the island. Now the Tsethem were using one to descend. \n\nThe dark mirror is basically what the islanders call the underdark. A huge spaghetti nest of twisting tunnels, huge caverns, and dangerous shafts. It's existence is simple: When the Colossi created Tirkosu they needed to channel one of each element into plane. That included shadow. But they didn't want a region of murky, festering evil on the surface, so they buried it deep. The dark mirror eventually spawned Mirlings, who found it easy to survive down there. But for the Tsethem, it was another matter.\n\nDark, cold, and lonely. Even Turf felt claustrophobic. The informant, who they'd named Kiatori, said that even he wasn't sure how to find the main Mirling city. The fluxating, veiny nature of the highest tunnels meant that finding the surface was easy, as you simply moved up. But going down was a lot more difficult. Any wrong path taken could send you to a completely different place.\n\nThey spent roughly a week down in the depths. Everyone was getting frustrated, especially Jaques. Every day they spent trying to find this prophet was another opportunity for him to strike. Tensions were running high.\n\nIt was Della who saved them. Every night she'd been praying to the Supreme One for guidance, and at long last he had answered. And he gave a lot more than simple guidance; a portal opened up in their makeshift camp, looking out over the Mirling city. It was a huge ravine with caves set into the walls, descending downwards to a stalagmite-ridden palace. \n\nThey stepped through the portal. It was very quiet for a city, so I assumed it must have been \"night time\" for the Mirlings. Kiatori said the prophet was residing in the palace below. They scrambled along the sheer rocky side, using thick webs hanging on the walls to swing down. A few guards noticed them and took some potshots, but the Tsethem pressed on. They barged into the throne room before with little to no resistance, and were met by a Mirling priestess. \n\nThere was no sign of any Human prophet. \n\nThe priestess mocked them, speaking in common. She told Kiatori that he'd played right into their plan; they were wise to his betrayal, and had timed the attack to coincide with the Tsethem's inevitable visit. The Elder Eye's chosen phophet was leading his army to the surface world right at that moment, and all would tremble before them. The protectors were too late. \n\nOnly, they weren't. Flamer melted the priestess before Della transported them back to Hepthurai with *Word of Recall*. They were met by the elder Aaracokra, who told them that the Mirling army had emerged from the old Dwarven mines in the centre of the island. They'd proceeded to split into five groups, and head off to certain villages. Karu Sampur, Gokapu, and Pekheiai had all been targeted, as had Pernep. The Mirlings had tried to take Tapuk, but the harsh conditions and ferocity of the Golath defence had driven them off. But it was only a tactical retreat to regroup; and there were rumours that the prophet himself was a part of the reinforcements. \n\nThe team split up, much to Turf's chagrin. To her, the Mirling's tactics didn't make sense. Instead of giving chase to those fleeing the conquered villages, they seemed to be staying put. Almost like the villages were specific control points, but that also made no sense; Gokapu and Pernep wouldn't exactly be high priority on anyone's list of places to take over. \n\nBut the other Tsethem weren't so hung up on tactics, so they went ahead and split the party. Flamer went to defend the Warforged in Karu Sampur. Inalak flew Jaques to Paku on the flying tower, to check up on Tikka. Della and Korena set off for the ancient mines, intending to seal them off and prevent any more Mirlings coming through that way. And Turf accompanied Naliko across the mountain to Tapuk, where the Golath were preparing for the second attack. \n\nNight had fallen on the island. The fortified village of ice had set burning sconces on its walls, allowing some light to be shed on the imminent battle. The Mirlings and Golath charged toward each other, hoarse throats yelling and boots crunching in the snow. Turf and Nali ploughed into the onslaught, each using their signature combat style. Turf hacked away at the dark mirror-lings with her giant meat cleaver. Naliko was wielding Black Icicle, a glaive she'd picked up in the Mirling city. She spun it effortlessly and with deadly accuracy, while Winterbrough bounded along beside her and sank his teeth into the invaders. For a moment, it seemed like the two Tsethem could hold the line all on their own. \n\nThen the prophet of the Elder Eye stormed over the slope. He was wearing dark plate armor and wielding a cruel, angular sword in one hand; his other was completely missing. Turf charged toward him but he ignored her, dropping a knee and planting a mechanical device in the snow. As Turf was about to strike a beam of red light shot out from a crystal in the small machine, streaking out over the island like a giant laser. It headed southwest, turning sharply when it reached the spot over Gokapu. Again and again it crossed the island, turning when it passed over one of the captured villages. Eventually it turned back towards Tapuk and collided exactly with the same crystal. The image it had drawn over the island was clear: a titanic, fiery star. A summoning circle, shimmering over the island like a giant-sized light show. \n\nTurf aimed a blow at the device but the prophet was too quick. The two engaged in a duel in the snow, neither giving any ground. They were pretty evenly matched. She was a level eighteen powerhouse, and he had the stats of a death knight. The sword gave him an edge, however; it was a voidblade, crafted from the pure shadow and gifted to the prophet by the Elder Eye himself. If someone was killed with it, there was no resurrection that could bring you back: it froze you in time, dead now and dead forever. This battle wasn't a simple duel Turf could walk away from: it was an all or nothing roll of the dice.\n\nThe last thing she needed was to be thrown off guard. \n\nThe prophet stepped back and remove his helmet. Ever since the start of the adventure, I knew this moment had been coming. Claye Bridgewater stood before his sister, eyes burning purple with malice. He started to spit out insults and hate, cursing her name and blaming her for the death of their mother. Turf was a monster in his eyes. To him, she was responsible for the fall of Orthraze. \n\nTurf was basically in shock. It was the sight of Naliko getting thrown around by some Mirlings that kicked her into action. She powered into Claye with a primal roar, the crash of their blades audible all over the village. They wore each other down until they were both within a single hit from death. Claye decided to flee, but Turf wasn't having that. The threw her blade at his retreating back and impaled him through the side of his neck.\n\nThe snow was stained red all around them, lit by the still active summoning star. Turf crawled toward her brother and turned him over. He couldn't move as the blade had severed his spinal chord. His eyes had lost their purple fire; whatever it was that had possessed him had left its host. He didn't need to say anything, for Turf knew what his look way trying to tell her. He was sorry. Sorry for failing her, and for allowing the demon to control him. \n\nAnd Turf tearfully forgave him over and over again, long after he'd stopped hearing her.\n\n* * *\n\nDella and Korena were flying back to Hepthurai, terrified of what they'd seen. The centre of the summoning star was located right over the old Dwarven mines, from which Imix had been summoned by Flamer only a few years ago. The two clerics hadn't been able to find the dark mirror entrance before the immense power of the star had activated. The elemental nodes had been charged and drawn forth three Archomentals; Ogremoch, Olhydra, and Yan-C-Bin.\n\nPrimordials walked upon Tirkosu once again. But this time, creation was not their intent. They had come to destroy. \n\n* * *\n* * *\n\nI feel like I should apologise for any typos that might still be lingering about. (º¬º) I don't proof read while doing this, I just write Kerouac-style.

        "text": "I figured I'd start writing again, this time about the adventures of a group of 8...well, adventurers making their way through the land of Eorzea. This post is to get you familiar with the characters in the stories. Mods, I'd appreciate it if you kept this up if it isn't breaking any rules. Anyway, without further ado...\n\nKorgon Hellblood: Male Roegadyn Hellsguard Warrior. Effectively the leader of the 8-person band. (read: he's my main character.) The only one who can match Minerve drink-for-drink. Uses an axe and his remarkable size in combat. Snarky, but knows when to get serious and when to get silly.\n\nMinerve Keide: Female Roegadyn Sea Wolf Pugilist. Fights with her fists and feet, using her impressive physical stature to her full advantage. The only thing she enjoys more than fighting is drinking. Has a soft spot for small animals. Holds the \"record\" among the group for \"greatest number of chairs broken over head before losing consciousness\" at 17. Afraid of heights.\n\nShiramun Qerel: Male Au Ra Xaela Conjurer. Fights at long-range with his magic, as well as protecting and healing his allies. Very skilled chef. *Very* defensive about his choice of vocation.\n\nMomo Heartrose: Female Au Ra Raen Thaumaturge. Fights using fire and ice magic in tandem. Currently in training to become a Red Mage, styling herself after the heroine of her favorite storybooks as a child. Easily the biggest optimist of the group, almost to a fault.\n\nDagnar Snowmane. Male Hyur Highlander Gladiator. Uses a sword and shield in combat. Stern and serious, almost comically so, but has a surprising talent for knitting and weaving. Enjoys fights to the degree that he will intentionally handicap himself \"to keep things interesting\".\n\nDaerra Vaicannet: Female Elezen Wildwood Lancer. Uses a spear in combat. Boasts the longest overall range of any of the physical fighters in the group, thanks to her long arms and legs, and her choice of weapon. Can be cocky at times, especially in areas concerning skill-at-arms.\n\nFlorimond Ignemortel: Male Elezen Duskwight Archer. Uses a bow in combat. Currently training to become a Bard. Considers himself enough of one already, titles be damned. Tries to find a song, a story, or a poem in anything and everything. Has absolutely *zero* fashion sense, however good his eyesight is when aiming his bow.\n\nPalomoko Polomoko: Female Lalafell Dunesfolk Rogue. Fights with a pair of daggers, coupled with agility and distraction. Went to Limsa Lominsa to train to be an Arcanist, but found the call of the Rogue's Guild too enticing to resist. Handles the group's finances and allowances.\n\nThanks for reading this far, first story goes up tomorrow!",

Kilmorn Taevarth was holding the Deck of Many Things in his hand.\n\nI was psyched. This was the first time I'd been given access to the deck. I hadn't even read up on its stats before, as I try and keep my knowledge of magic items to a minimum so as not to spoil any surprises. I'd read a lot about it on forums however, and I knew that the safest bet is to draw multiple cards at once. Kilmorn would be clueless about this, obviously. But Angelica Mayvern wouldn't be.\n\nShe told Kilmorn to draw from the pack. He took three cards, one after the other. For any normal person, this would be dicing with death, or worse. But Kil was one half of the Danger Duo. He wasn't just a normal person. These were the cards he drew:\n\nKey: a rare magic item. A +3 katana appeared in his hand, randomly generated with some custom fluff.\n\nMoon: 1d3 wishes. Naturally, I rolled a 1.\n\nFinally, and probably most importantly: Knight. Gain lifetime servitude from a warrior of 4th level (the same level as the team happened to be). \n\nSo, new character time. This was getting ridiculous now, but I stuck with it. I was playing six characters at once. One was admittedly our of action, but we'll get back to her in a moment. At that moment a clone of Kilmorn popped into being, dressed in full plate armor and carrying a chunky sword. He was almost exactly the same as Kilmorn, with the only difference being that he wasn't quite as dense. \n\nKilly wasnt too bothered by having another version of himself walking around. In fact, the more the merrier. Angelica quietly suggested a name from her homeland: Pekeski. Callie said she liked it, and that settled it for Kilmorn. Pekeski it was. \n\nRictavio the vampire slayer was nowhere to be seen, but they felt confident enough to take on the enemy. Armed with their new boons and friends, they set off through the gloom toward castle Ravenloft. \n\n* * *\n\nVanella Thane was sipping tea with Strahd, listening to him drone on about his wedding plans. She was getting rather a buzz from the drink, as Tirkosu doesn't have any naturally occurring caffeine on it. Some creepy elf butler had taken Ireena away, so it was just her and the Baron. \n\nThen charm wore off, and she realized how much danger she was in. Sitting in a strange castle with a lunatic who had shrugged off the combined strength of her friends, and no Elo around to watch out for her. Things were looking bleak for Vanella Thane. \n\nThen Strahd placed his hand on her forehead and bored into her mind. He shouldn't have had the power to do that, according to his statblock, but the virtual DM was very clear: he was probing into her thoughts, breaking down her memories. Sifting through two different lives, one where her parents were alive, the other where they were not. Truth and lies were mingled together. The lie that Thane had believed up until now was laid bare: her parents were gone. \n\nThere was no Mr. And Mrs. Thane waiting on Tirkosu for their daughter to return. They had been killed all the way back in the Great War, most likely. It was hard to tell through the murky haze of the memories she had taken as truth. At the time I thought this was simply her way of coping with the grief; that she was in denial about losing her family. This would have been a pretty neat character arc, and I would have been happy with it. It later would turn out to be much more complex, but this was what I thought at the time. \n\nStrahd gave a speech, something to the effect that she was special. I had no clue what he was referencing at the time. Thane wasn't listening either, still in shock over the two conflicting memories in her brain. She didn't even properly register it when the Baron allowed her to exit the castle. In his eyes, he'd damaged her enough. I was surprised he didn't try and turn her into a thrall at the time. But knowing how her story continues, I can now see why. \n\nShe made her fumbling way down the path to try and meet back up with her friends. But sadly, the vDM was merciless. Traveling on your own in Barovia, at night, is just asking for trouble. Soon a lone wolf was chasing her, and it quickly caught up. A vicious attack left her making death saving throws, but thankfully the wolf didn't drag her off to eat her. Instead it ran off and left her to bleed out, alone and unconscious. She was only a quarter of a mile away from the safety of the village. \n\n* * *\n\nI played what I always play when a character dies: Time, by Hans Zimmer. It was pitch black outside, accurately mirroring my mood. Thane had just been getting interesting to play, and she had to go and die on me. Typical characters, you can never trust them to behave. \n\nShe'd died on the path back to the village of Barovia, so there was no way the rest of the team would come across her on their way to Strahd's castle. I gave her up for lost, and continued with the remaining members of the party.\n\nBefore them stood Castle Ravenloft. Grim, gothic, and foreboding. The weather worsened as they crossed the rickety drawbridge and crossed the courtyard. The dungeon crawl had begun.\n\nI'm not going to go into detail about what happened inside the castle, because of spoilers. Simply put, it was hell. There were traps around every corner, some real and some not. There were impossible to beat challenges. There was moldy cake. There was very little to be pleased about, and no sign of Ireena or Vanella (obviously). The only ray of hope happened when they were being constantly teleported into these watery cells, and Pekeski discovered a nice glowy sword in one. But apart from that, they found nothing but pain and misery.\n\nEventually they worked their way to a strange hourglass system that looked like it might have originated from Orthraze's glory days. Elo tried fiddling around with it because he knew the most about magitek. That turned out to be a pretty big mistake, as the device sent them warping through space to an attic in Vallaki.\n\nI was pretty annoyed that the crawl had practically been for nothing; there had been no sign of their friend, and they hadn't even encountered Strahd. If Elo could cry, his eye would have been gushing. The rest of the team comforted him and set off again, this time planning on retracing their steps back to Barovia. It was a last-ditch attempt at finding Thane. \n\nAnd it payed off. When they arrived at the village they were directed towards the church. Vanella's blood-soaked corpse was being prepared for a burial by the priest, who incidentally was harboring a vampire spawn that was ruthlessly dispatched by Angelica. Elo just stood and stared. No one knew what was going on behind that big green eye. But before he could break down completely and go on a murderous rampage, Kilmorn stepped forward. He called upon the wish granted to him by the deck of many things, to raise Vanella from the dead. \n\nThe wounds closed, thee blood vanished, and she slowly raised her head. \"Uh... Yo.\" \n\nThey took it in turns to hug her, then introduced Angelica and Pekeski. She was in equal measures relieved to see them, and angry at Elo for keeping her in the dark about the fate of her parents. Elo apologised and said there was nothing he could have done; He was under orders from her father not to mention anything to do with their life before the Great War. \n\nIt was at this point that I began to wonder if Thane's memory problems might not be due to denial. There was definitely something more sinister going on. But that matter would have to wait, because the team was focusing solely on destroying Strahd and escaping the demiplane. Angelica was certain that the only way to take him out would be to enlist the help of Rictavio. So they went looking for him.\n\nThey traveled all over Barovia in search of the fabled vampire slayer. They protected ravenfolk from angry tree people, fought more of them on a tor while trying to find Strahd's memoirs, and had a narrow encounter with a ghost. Eventually they wound up back in Vallaki, sitting in the same pub they'd met Angelica in. There was no sign of Rictavio. They were ready to give up and storm the castle without him.\n\nSo, naturally, we found him. Or rather Angelica did. We'd been all over the demiplane in search of him, and there he was; sitting across the tavern from her and wearing a disguise. When she confronted him in private, he told her that his hunting days were over. He was too old to be gallavanting about trying to kill the unkillable. She said how disappointed in him she was, and that they were going to take on Strahd with or without his help. Rictavio just shrugged. But before she left, he gave her one piece of advice: there was a legend that spoke of a blade that could kill a vampire, forged from pure sunlight. It was supposedly hidden up at the castle. Angelica thanked him, and went to tell the others.\n\nSo once more, they marched to Ravenloft. They'd been in Strahd's realm for a week now, and they were all looking rather paler than usual. Excluding Angelica, naturally, and Elo. Lightning crashed and rain pelted down as they headed into the castle. They'd learned a lot about Strahd's defense on their travels, so they went straight to a certain artifact and destroyed it, greatly weakening him in the process. On the way there they discovered the sunsword lying on a mantelpiece. The blade was indeed made of light, as Angelica discovered when she attuned to it. They were all fired up for battle as the headed to the top of the castle.\n\nThe virtual DM was tired of waiting. Strahd cornered them at the highest point of the castle, and began to make some kind of impressive speech. He never finished it. Swords, maces, arrows, and the sunsword smote him with a fury. But most effective was the flying fists of Kilmorn Taevarth. The dragonborn's pride had been sorely hurt by their first encounter with the Baron, and his vengeance could not be contained. Strahd fled, passing through a solid wall. Kilmorn followed. He smashed through a stained glass window, fell several feet onto the vampire lord, delivered an final blow that turned his adversary to a smoky mist, before catching himself on a gargoyle below.\n\nThat was the kind of crazy stunt that earned him an Callie their nickname.\n\nIt wasn't over. Not yet. Angelica had fought enough vamps to know that death in combat is only a setback for them. To truly kill one, you needed to strike at its core. \n\nDown they went, down to the crypts below the castle. There were so many tombs, and so many traps. Eventually they discovered one that belonged to Ireena. They found her inside, drained of her blood and fully under Strahd's control. She attacked them. There was nothing they could do to persuade her otherwise. Pekeski did the honors, slicing off her head with his glowing sword. They had failed Ismark and his sister. \n\nBut they would be damned before they let Strahd live after this. \n\nThey found his tomb, locked away behind bars. Kilmorn was teleported into the crypt and had to face off against three vampire spawn at once, while the rest went up against the surprisingly strong elf butler. Pekeski and kilmorn went down, followed by Angelica. Thane zapped the spawn to smithereens using her gauntlets. Elo and Callie worked together to defeat the butler. It was a harrowingly close battle. There was nothing epic about it like some close shaves I've seen; they were trying everything they could to stay one step ahead of death. \n\nAnd they prevailed. By the skin of their teeth, they prevailed.\n\nCallie healed up the wounded and Kilmorn let them into the crypt. The coffin sat before them; their final target. Elo and Pekeski lifted the heavy lid as Angelica activated the sunsword. The Baron of Barovia lay  in his tomb, eyes fixed in wrathful horror at the half-vampire standing over him. He was unable to move, unable to fight back. This was the end for Strahd.\n\n Angelica spoke, but there was no anger in her soft tone. \n\n\"Strahd Von Zarovitch. You brought misery to so many people. You murdered your brother, and his wife. You hurt my friends. I should feel no remorse about killing you.\"\n\nShe leaned closer, almost whispering now. \"But I do. I do feel, Strahd. I feel sorry for you. Sorry that you wasted life. You had so much to give this land, and you choose to squander it.\" She let out a little sigh. \"I suppose that in the end, that's the biggest difference between you and I. Because although we both have to slake our thirst of blood, to keep ourselves alive... *I feel.* You do not.\"\n\n\"That's what makes me the hero. And you, the vampire.\"\n\nDown plunged the sunsword. Strahd screamed as his unlife ebbed away. Within seconds there was nothing left but a blackened skeleton clad in tattered robes.\n\nThey just sat there for a while. It was over. The master of Barovia was defeated, and the way home was clear. Eventually they headed back out of the castle, taking with them some proof that they were the Strahd's slayers: his headstone, and his skull.\n\nThe walk back to the village was less dismal with the sun lighting up the leafless trees and muddy banks. The residents of Barovia were rejoicing in the streets as they entered, and soon a banquet was being thrown for the heroes of lands far away. They left the tombstone with the people but Angelica kept the skull: Strahd was the final, most important kill of her career as a vampire slayer. She wanted some kind of trophy. \n\nThe team headed back into the mists. They had an epic tale to tell the villagers of Pernep, and a lot of sunbathing to do. When they had entered the demiplane, they had been but four in number. Now they were six. \n\nNow, they were heroes. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nI dunno what to put in the ending blurb this time, so instead here's a big hand for all those still reading this rather extensive tale: ლ(ツ)",

Well, I picked up Curse of Strahd. New adventure, new characters, new setting. If you're new to this story, you can safely jump right into this part without reading the whole saga beforehand. I won't say you're not missing anything, but I will say that you won't be completely confused.\n\n* * *\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/767n9h/my_experiences_playing_solo_dd/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76en9o/my_continued_experiences_playing_solo_dd/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/79nl1f/playing_solo_what_happens_when_the_virtual_dm/), [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7aliy8/playing_solo_aftermath/), [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7dkb20/playing_solo_you_can_never_have_enough_characters/), [Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7eshhb/playing_solo_things_get_rather_epic/), [Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7f861z/playing_solo_the_age_of_tsethem/)\n\n[A brief transcription of how solo D&amp;D works](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76ym0f/playing_solo_a_transcription/)\n\n* * *\n\nSo. Curse of Strahd. This adventure is just fantastic. I absolutely love it. And I absolutely hate it.\n\nUnlike other modules, like PotA or Storm King's Thunder, Strahd needs a lot of prep. It has a tonne of lore, lore that seems to be spread out over multiple different chapters. You need to reference loads of relationships, locations, random encounters... The works. You really need to have the book there with you while running it. And I essentially played through the whole darn thing on a tablet.\n\nI was traveling for a week, with nothing much to do other than play D&amp;D. It was pretty great, actually. Or it would have been, with an actual computer instead of a dinosaur with an 8-bit display screen.\n\nOkay, that's somewhat hyperbolic, the tablet wasn't too bad. But navigating through the hastily-scanned pdf, reloading the whole thing every time I switched between that and the character sheets, and trying to figure out the 3d maps... Oh crumpets, those 3d maps. I still have the nightmares.\n\nBut the actual game? It was so worth it. \n\n* * *\n\nNew adventure, new cast. CoS required the participating parties to be in the lower level tier, and it was enough of a challenge to play though it RAW without modifying the encounters on the go. So I brought out some old friends from the previous campaign to brave the demiplane of dread. \n\nI had previously run the Danger Duo though all the adventurers' league adventures in the Elemental Evil storyline. Callie Longstrider, a chipper redhead human archer, and Kilmorn Taevarth, a rather dim but strong ice dragonborn. They got their name because there wasn't a single adventure in which none of them had to roll a death saving throw. They were so prone to near-fatal experiences that it was ridiculous. Jumping off a tower and into a ravine, running into a house fire, getting mauled by a wyvern... The challenges weren't even that dangerous on paper, but these two managed to to make everything worse before somehow pulling through. I remember thinking that playing them was akin to watching an Indiana Jones movie; wild and chaotic, but with almost unbelievable luck.\n\nTo bring the roster up to the recommended amount, I also brought back Elo and Vanella. I'd only briefly got to play them through the starter set, because Vanella died in the final dungeon, of all places. Elo was a big silver Warforged, with a single green eye and a habit of referring to himself in third person. \"Elo does not understand the concept of X\" was his catchphrase, where X was anything from emotions to social constructs. He sounded like C-3PO if he was a text-to-speech program. Vanella Thane was the opposite of him in many ways: a petite, unimposing human with messy brown hair and a very steampunk fashion sense. She had this perpetually neutral, almost bored expression on her face. That combined with her cool-as-a-cucumber reaction whenever shad hit the fan, almost made her seem like she had brain damage, or was simple a bit dense.\n\nBut she wasn't. In fact, she was pretty dang clever. She made a living as an arcane mechanic, fixing worn down magitek and inventing her own devices. Elo and Vanella worked really well together. She was the tiny deadpan snarker, and he was the quiet, brute strength she used to back up her smack talk. And to hide behind when things went pear shaped.\n\nBoth these pairs fit fairly easily into Tirkosu. Callie was from down south, in the medieval-style village of Pernep. Kilmorn had been a victim of a planefall incident on the plane of ice, stranding him on the island when he was a child. He'd studied with the Aaracokra at Hepthurai, and had moved to Pernep when his training was complete. Vanella Thane had folks living up north, and she was using the low tech level of Pernep to charge handsomely for her creations. Elo was a very early prototype Warforged, and was under orders from Thane's father to keep her safe while she was away from home. As CoS recommends a starting level of 3, I decided that they had helped fight back against the dragon cultists when they'd invaded Pernep.\n\nThe stage was set. Elo and Vanella were heading to Rahm Oru to pick up some technical supplies, and they'd hired Callie and Kilmorn as guides. Traveling in Tirkosu is always risky due to the nature of the planar structure: stray off the stable areas at the wrong time and you could wind up lost in one of the elemental planes, or worse. This was exactly what happened to the team. They set up camp in the piny woods surrounding Pernep, and awoke in a bleak, leafless forest. The demiplane had brought them into its prickly embrace.\n\nKilmorn was close to panicking, but Callie and Vanella managed to quieten him down. They tried retracing their steps and soon came across the road leading to the village of Barovia. Upon reaching the village they did what all good adventurers do, and headed to the tavern. Elo stayed outside in the rain so as not to freak out the locals.\n\nThey got to talking with a guy called Ismark and he told them that they could not leave the realm, not while the devil Strahd held sway. Thane wasn't buying it, figuring that it was some sort of scam, but Callie and Kilmorn thought he seemed trustworthy enough. He told them that Strahd was after his sister Ireena, and begged the team to help escort her to a safer village. They agreed because they had zero money and no other way of earning any more. \n\nThey set off right away, which was rather stupid. Night had crept up on them while they were drinking in the pub. The bats were circling over head ominously. It was only a matter of time.. \n\nBaron Strahd Von Zarovitch stood before them on the path. Hounds from the fiery depths of hell paced around his billowing cloak. He raised heavily shadowed eyes toward them and spoke a greeting. He welcomed them to his kingdom and invited them to dine with him up in his lofty castle. Cal and Kil seemed inclined to check it out, but Ismark vehemently warned them against doing so. Strahd tired of the debating and gave an ultimatum: hand over Ireena and stay unscathed, or suffer the consequences. So Vanella Thane gave Elo \"The Signal\", and he charged into battle along with Kilmorn and Ismark. \n\nIt was a massacre.\n\nKilmorn pummeled Strahd with everything he had, but barely put a dent in that brooding visage. Ismark was nearly torn to pieces by the wolves but was saved by Callie sticking them full of arrows. Elo was brought down to zero by Strahd's first couple of attacks. Vanella didn't even have a chance to unleash some arcane fury from her magitek gauntlets, as Strahd effortlessly charmed both Ireena and her. It was only a couple of rounds before the rest of the team joined Elo on the floor. \n\nSomehow, due to some incredibly lucky rolls, they all made their death saving throws. Callie awoke a couple of hours later, and used the few healing spells she had to cure the rest of the team. I honestly can't remember if Ismark survived. I can't remember him influencing the rest of the adventure, so I assume he was the only one that didn't make it through. As for his sister... Both Ireena and Vanella were nowhere to be seen. \n\nElo was distraught. That much was obvious, despite his monotone voice and strange speech patterns. \"Mistress must be rescued. Elo cannot abandon mistress.\" Cal and Kil tried to reassure him to no avail. Eventually he agreed not to go charging into Strahd's castle, and to wait until they found a way to fight such a powerful enemy. They continued on the path they had set out on, and arrived at the dismal town of Vallaki. \n\nA warm (if tasteless) meal and a good night's kip had them thinking straight again. Back on Tirkosu, if you came across something like an evil vampire that took your friends, the thing to do would be to call the Tsethem. There were no Tsethem in Barovia and everyone seemed to afraid to even talk about Strahd, but there had to be someone who could at least give them a few pointers. Callie asked around, and bam, new character time. \n\nAngelica Mayvern, a old character who'd died to a giant woodlouse in one of my Mines of Madness runs. She was a half-vampire; someone who'd been bitten badly enough to gain a few lesser traits of her proper kin, but without being all over powered. Or evil. In fact, Angelica was a monster hunter extraordinaire. She'd killed the vamp who'd bitten her before setting off on a tour of the planes to take out every single one like him. To her knowledge, Strahd was the last. \n\nIf you've played through CoS, you might know this is basically the same premise as Rictavio, the acclaimed vampire killer. When playing solo modules I try and read only as much of the book as I need, which is easy enough in a properly arranged adventure. CoS is not a properly arranged adventure. The team was about to leave Vallaki when I discovered Rictavio's section, and had a good laugh at fate, coincidence, sod's law, and the universe in general. \n\nI decided to roll with it. Angelica was looking to team up with Rictavio to take down Strahd. She'd heard rumors that he was camping out by an old wizard's tower, so that was where the party was heading. When they arrived they found a little rickety caravan waiting outside. Both that and the tower seemed to be on lockdown. Kilmorn managed to get inside the former and discovered a bunch of explosives wired to the door, which he dutifully packed into a bag and gave to Elo to carry. \n\nAnd there they were. A pack of cards. \n\nNow, I've always wanted to include the deck of many things in a game, but so far the virtual DM had been stingey. Whenever a character came across a pack of cards, I'd ask if it was the legendary deck, with only a tiny chance of a positive answer. This was too perfect though; the cards were exactly the sort of thing a fabled monster hunter would have in his possession. I decided that now was the time to ask, fifty-fifty percent chance of yes: was Kilmorn holding the Deck of Many Things? \n\nFlying at forty thousand feet above the British channel, I rolled the percentile dice that would decide the fate of Callie, Kilmorn, Elo, and Vanella.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nCliffhanger time! [:3] Also, shout out to /u/Mage_Malteras, who's been a mobSol since *2013*!! Mad props to him for managing to do so with 4e, of all editions.",

        "text": "'Sup guys, long time reader, first time poster. I want to share with you the great, weird saga of a GURPS game I've been playing for the past year and a half, I hope you like it!\n\n**DRAMATIS\nPERSONAE**\n\n**Trinidad\nde la Vega**: a Zorro-inspired, parkour-doing, horse riding, pink\nhaired womanizer latina vigilante. Played by me.\n\n**Maria\nde la Vega**: an ex-witch almost-nun albino latina. Also, she's\nZorro too. An NPC.\n\n**Ariel\nHorowitz**: an Irish Jew, shy boy who is part of a motorcycle gang, the Werewolves.\nHe's dating Danielle. Played by my friend... We shall name her Red\nPanda.\n\n**Danielle\nDean**: hot redhead head of a motorcycle gang named after the\nDothraki. Used to have a secret identity as the Khal of the Dothraki\ngang (everyone thought she was a man). Scary as hell, will fight you\nand win. Another NPC.\n\n**Alex\nHorowitz**: Ariel's twin. Womanizer, loves is brother, doesn't have\na good relationship with Trinidad. Oh look, another NPC.\n\n**Marv**:\nthe Jar Jar Bar's bartender. Huge, heavy muscled grey-haired man who\nis 7 feet and 54 inches tall. Our favourite NPC, because Trinidad\ndefinitely doesn't have mommy issues and daddy issues.\n\n**PLACES**\n\n**Angel\nGrove**:\nthe city, located in California. I didn’t realise it was a Power\nRanger reference. It has 154,249\nresidents (a third of which are directly or indirectly related to\nTrinidad, because the de la Vega are good with the ladies).\n\n**Jar Jar Bar**: a very\nnice and popular pub run by Marv. Named like this because of an IRL\ninjoke. The in-game reason is that there's a trophy of Jar Jar's head hung to the wall.\n\n**THE\nSTORY BEGINS**\n\nA\nyear ago the man who GMs all of my games, Carebear GM (named like\nthis because he's basically a human carebear), asked me to be part of\na new GURPS campaign. I had never played with GURPS before, so I was\ncurious – also I had already played with him with another one and a\nhalf Pathfinder campaigns (one that ended more or less badly because\nof a That Guy player, one that ended prematurely because I'm an\nidiot) that were a lot of fun, so I trusted him to run a pretty good\ngame. He enlisted as a second player my good friend Red Panda, who\nhad never played GURPS, just like me. We were going to play with\nDiscord and Maptool, because I live in our birthplace (a small\nItalian island), Carebear lives in the mainland and Red Panda in\nGermany.\n\nWe\ndecided to play a game inspired by classic American teen dramas and\nthose urban fantasy tv series like Buffy, but, at the start of the\ngame, there was no magic in the world, so I thought Carebear GM had\nabandoned that part of the worldbuilding. I imagined we were going to\nhave a crime fighting/investigation campaign, with a side of me\nseducing or trying to seduce all of the female NPCs.\n\nBoy,\nI was wrong, I was sooo fucking wrong.\n\nFast\nforwarding a bit, my character, Trinidad de la Vega (this is actually\njust her surname, she hates her name) was chilling in the PCs\nfavourite pub, the Jar Jar Bar, with a character she had already had\nsex with before, Veronica Wong (who was married, but Trinidad didn't\nknow it when they did the do) and Joy Mounds, a nurse (the GM knows\nEnglish well enough to make terrible puns) when she suddenly felt a\nstinging pain in the back of her neck. Touching the skin, Trinidad\nfelt blood and concerned, asked Joy to check what the fuck was going\non. Joy found that on her skin was now carved a symbol. When Carebear\nGM described the symbol, I stopped the game and told him \"Bro,\nif you do what I think you wanna do, I'm going to strangle you the\nmoment we see each other, you know that rape and that fucking eclipse\nare a touchy subject for me\".\n\nThe\nsymbol was Berserk's Brand of Sacrifice.\n\nMarv,\nthe bartender, our favourite NPC, brought out his paternal instincts\nand gave me food and drinks to make me feel better and consoled the\npoor Trinidad. He later did something similar with Ariel too, who had\nan even closer relationship with him. He was very likeable even\ntho he used to be a Mafia hitman.\n\nI\nsoon realized that Red Panda's character, Ariel, his twin brother\nAlex, Danielle and a bunch of other characters that were part of the\nDothraki gang and the Werewolves gang (and almost every NPC in town\nfrom their teen years to their early twenties) had been branded as a\nSacrifice. My character's cousin, Maria the apprentice nun, hadn't\nbeen marked, but decided to help us. She didn't like Trinidad, didn't\nhave a good relationship with the de la Vega clan (they had shunned\nher, because her mother hated her, she was an albino and born from\nrape), but she felt compelled to help her family. They might have\ntreated her like shit, but they didn't deserve to die like this...\nAnd this is also were my character started to develop a bit of a\ncrush on her, courtesy of me really, really liking Maria as a\ncharacter, and me developing a bit of a white knight syndrome. As I\nsaid, rape is a sore spot for me to talk about, put that together\nwith social isolation and an unloving family and I went full knight.\nI wanted to save her, I wanted the clan to take her back and\napologize for being jerks, and I wanted to apologize for a fight we\npreviously had in-game were I called her a \"maldita monja\".\n\nRed\nPanda is a better player than me – partially because, since she's\nolder than me, she has been playing for a longer time, partially\nbecause I lose focus very easily – so she basically did all the\ngrunt work of researching what the hell was going on, and found out\nwhat the Brand of Sacrifice meant (funny tidbit: Berserk exists in\nour game so yes, her character read the manga). She found  old\nnewspapers, legends and other things that talked about a great number\nof people all part of the same demographic dying at the same time for\nno discernible reason. She found out that the power plant had a floor\nlayout that looked like the Brand and we decided to raid for info the\npower plant director's mansion.\n\nSince\nthis is getting long I will be finishing this part of the story with\nthis and I will give you one more information. I mentioned in the\ndramatis personae that my character dyes her hair pink. It's a\nreference to another character of mine, the one I played in the\nPathfinder campaign that ended prematurely. She was a pink-haired\nbard. Why was she pink-haired?  \n\nBecause she was a tribute to\nUtena Tenjo.\n\nPS:\nI hope this fits in this subreddit, tell me if it doesn’t. I really\nwant to share this with someone!",

        "text": "So I bought FIASCO awhile back and I've been spoiling to play a game of it with my sisters, who visited this Thanksgiving. This is the story of the ridiculousness that evolved out of the setting \"Nut People\".\n\nSetting: The town of \"Merple\" Georgia (originally Quigley, but we changed it) is experiencing a boom in the pecan industry driving the price of pecans to a nickel each. Now big business is squeezing out the small producers and everyone is trying to get a slice of the pie.\n\nCharacters:\n\nRoyce McGuinness - a mid-twenties hick living in a truck parked in a hobo encampment 1 exit away from the Original Georgia Nut Warehouse (OG Nuthouse) where he works seasonally as an internet shipping packer and moonlight nut-thief.\n\nRelationship Royce/Traci - Career Nut-Thieves; Need - To Get Nuts\n\nTraci Tarberry - Oldest child of Papa Tarberry, the ailing patriarch of the once great Tarberry Farms. Expecting to live off the wealth of her father indefinitely, Traci has been leading a highfalutin lifestyle in Atlanta where she has racked up some considerable debt. She's recently returned to Merple after the purchase and dissolution of Tarberry Farms  (by the OG Nuthouse) desperate for a solution to her money woes.\n\nRelationship Traci/Tammi - Contentious Siblings; Object - Fake Pecan with RFID Tracker Inside\n\nTammi Tarberry - Traci's younger sister, daddy's favorite, and a pollyanna beloved by the entire town of Merple. She has recently acquired a job at the OG Nuthouse as an internet order shipping packer, partnered with Royce McGuinness.\n\nRelationship Tammi/Royce - Internet Shipping Packers @ OG Nuthouse; Location - The OG Nuthouse\n\nSo Traci returns home and cooks up a nut-laundering scheme with Royce wherein Royce skims nuts from the OG Nuthouse and mails them to Atlanta PO boxes in Traci's name. Traci hauls the nuts back to Royce who resells them to the OG Nuthouse through a hobo intermediary named Cracker Jack. However, Traci isn't satisfied with the rate of return and pressures Royce into stepping up the operation. \n\nWhile working at the OG Nuthouse, Royce is put in charge of training Tammi and proceeds to co-opt the unsuspecting Tarberry into mailing out massive quantities of nuts to the PO Boxes under her employee ID code. After conning Tammi into giving him a ride home to the hobo encampment, Royce recruits additional hobos into his operation, adding Fiddle Faddle, Crunch, and Munch to the team under the management of Cracker Jack, effectively turning it into a nut-laundering pyramid scheme.\n\nSoon Traci is returning to Merple in the dead of night in a Uhaul loaded with stolen nuts still in their packaging when she is pulled over just outside of city limits by Merple's finest, Officers Darren Sadley Jr. and Destiny Oglethorpe. The police catch on that Traci is up to no good and hatch a plan to investigate her activities in the hopes of getting promoted to detectives. To this end, they invite her sister Tammi to the Honesuckle on the pretext of pecan pie and proceed to intimidate her into planting an RFID pecan in the next shipment she sends out for Royce/Traci.\n\nMeanwhile, Royce and Traci are awaiting the return of Cracker Jack with the money from the laundered pecans, but he is late. Royce demands the whereabouts of Cracker Jack from Fiddle Faddle, Crunch, and Munch but receives conflicting narratives and incoherent puking respectively. Royce and Traci spend the rest of the night searching every dive bar and train yard for Cracker Jack and their nut-laundering money but come up empty. Growing paranoid, they agree to pull off one more massive nut-shipment with the remaining hobos and then leave town.\n\nThe next shift between Royce and Tammi sees the RFID tracker pecan secreted in another shipment of stolen nuts to the Atlanta PO boxes. Unfortunately for Tammi, Officers Darren Sadley Jr. and Destiny Oglethorpe approach her again after work and pressure her into wearing a wire and recording incriminating evidence on her sister.\n\nTammi approaches Traci as she is preparing to make the run to Atlanta in her Uhaul, but when she confronts her sister Traci is able to spin a web of lies that convinces Tammi to hop into the Uhaul and help her load the nuts. When they return to the hobo encampment, Royce is astounded to see Tammi in the passenger seat with Traci. The 3 characters begin arguing outside of the Uhaul, when Cracker Jack sneaks into the driver seat and takes off with their second cargo of nuts. The other hobos leap into the back of the Uhaul as well and pelt Royce in the face with pecans as he chases behind.\n\nEpilogue:\n\nThe RFID tracker pecan is found amidst the Hobo encampment, apparently having been thrown at Royce. Cracker Jack and crew escape, although the Uhaul is found abandoned sometime later.\n\nRoyce and Traci are convicted on the evidence gathered on the RFID pecan &amp; Tammi's wire, but the amount of money stolen is small enough that they only end up doing a stint in county jail, vowing to not get caught next time. \n\nTammi is exonerated of any complicity in the crimes of her sister and work partner by the doting townsfolk of Merple. Some time later, there is a knock on the door of the old Tarberry mansion; when Tammi answers she finds nothing but a tubesock full of pecans and a substantial amount of cash.\n\nOfficers Darren Sadley Jr. and Destiny Oglethorpe capitalize on their success and apply for jobs in Atlanta, attempting to leave Merple behind once and for all.",

Before heading off to this dungeon after hearing about it from a barkeep, Titan, (a Dragonborn Barbarian) had decided he wanted to slap a random patron in the bar (my cousins like shenanigans to say the least). \n\nI ask him to roll...\n\nNatural 20...\n\nHe runs up to a random drunkard, slaps him directly into a wall, and proceeds to run. The barkeep is in shock, as are the other patrons, but nothing comes of it. \n\nAfter coming back with some paintings and such, Titan wanted to give back to the barkeep. He laid out a painting, and started to leave, but had the urge to slap again. He ran up to the same poor, defenseless, now bandaged, man and went for it.\n\nNATURAL 20...

Another Dragonborn in the group, Vortex, whacked him in the face, and the third Dragonborn, Scar, got into a scuffle with the barkeep before running as well. \n\nThat bar now talks of a Dragonborn, his only noted name, “The Slapper”.",

        "text": "Hello gametales. I come to you with a story of such absurdity and awesomeness that I just have to share. Buckle up, because this is going to be a LONG one. This takes place in a high level (18) D&amp;D 3.5 game.\n\nIf you want to skip to the story, skip down to where the post says \"TODAY'S SESSION\" because this shit needs context.\n\nCONTEXT:\n\nour DM is insane. The world he's created involves demons popping up just for shits and giggles, mad prophecies, and a huge demonic overlord who wants to take over the material plane (of course!).\n\nThe world itself is currently in a state of eternal winter due to this \"everchosen\", the high priest of the previously mentioned demonlord. They're in the final stages of summoning him through into the world to mess it up permanently. To stop this, a small band of six...\"heroes\" has come together for various different reasons (divine intervention, duty, unwillingly forced to go) to deal with it. \n\nWe've killed the everchosen's mistress and We've boarded an airship on our final, probably suicidal, mission to defeat the everchosen.\n\nCHARACTERS: \n\nthe relevant characters are as follows.\n\nLizardfolk druid, with a T-Rex companion. Somehow hasnt gone insane and she is the only truly \"good\" character left in the group (everyone else is neutral or evil in some capacity).\n\n\nKobold wizard, insanely smart and venerable, also batshit insane. Resists pretty much everything to compensate for his 27hp. Did I mention he was also batshit crazy?\n\n\nHalf celestial caster, beautiful as sin, but has no face due to a curse laid upon her. Is also heavily pregnant with a demon's baby who has traits from a hair few other races (don't ask for full details, just accept) as she has an insatiable maternal instinct.\n\nOur other three characters (feral miniature barbarian, halfking outrider and her pony companion, and our draconic template warforged) sadly couldn't make the session, and so spend the entire time below deck pissing their pants due to failing fear checks.\n\n\nLAST SESSION\n\nAfter defeating the everchosen's mistress, the group took an airship to get to where the everchosen, our final challenge, laid waiting for us. En route, the boat gets attacked by a black dragon with a rider. Our wizard decides to use his newly crafted weirdstone cannon to attack it and succeeds.\n\nNow weirdstone is...weird. And dangerous. It's used in airtravel because it's highly combustible and produces a shedload of energy. However, it has some really bad magical properties; you know how in cartoons, radiation gives people some cool mutations but usually with awful side effects? Well the ship was burning and pumping that into the atmosphere.\n\nWe also just shot a dragon with that shit.\n\nIt goes down and we cheer, relaxing...until it roars again. Twice as loud. \n\nSuddenly we see this much bigger and angrier looking two headed black Dragon headed towards us. At this point half the party dive under deck from fear, leaving the three casters to deal with the incoming fury.\n\nAt least the rider was gone.\n\nCURRENT SESSION:\n\nWizard wastes no time and summons 4 huge air elementals before we hit initiative rounds. \n\nCaster goes first. Hastes everyone as a free action, and casts fly on the T-rex to go do some tanking.\n\nDruid goes next. Summons a greenbound Roc to help us fight. Turns into a dire bear in case shit goes south.\n\nT-Rex and Roc move. Both go in for attacks. T-rex tries to grapple a head and fails. Roc tears into the dragon and does some decent damage given it's a bird. \n\nDragon's turn. Uses charm reptile on the T-Rex who fails miserably. Attacks the Roc and does some nice damage too. \n\nWizards go. Commands the air elementals to surround and hold the dragon using whirlwind to keep it held in place. Also summons an even bigger air elemental.\n\nNow we have a huge whirlwind right behind the engines. DM warns us that this is sucking up all the expelled weirdstone from the engines. We shrug and go on.\n\nNext round.\n\nCaster jumps on the dire bear's back with the intent to ride her into combat. DM is a dick and makes her roll a con save. She fails. \"Congrats, your water has broken and you're giving birth. Oh and you're in excruciating pain.\"\n\nWe all collectively facepalm. Okay. This isn't good.\n\nDruid's go. Can't tank due to pregnant woman riding her and huge whirlwinda creating a huge barrier, so she joins in with all the air shit going on. Summons a greater whirlwind, much to the detriment of the party, because why not? Everyone has to save; dragon, druid and wizard are fine. T-rex goes prone inside the now humongous whirlwind. Caster also gets sucked inside because she fails her saving throw. The Roc fails and gets thrown onto the ship, lying prone. \n\nDragon passes it's spell resistance and attacks the T-rex and the caster inside the mega whirlwind. Does some decent damage in the process.\n\nWizard commands all the elemental to attack the dragon. Some hits, some misses, all in all, a decent round.\n\nAnd then the caster gets an idea.\n\n\"Can I use all my daily hastes on myself at the same time?\" DM pauses and says why not, and describes So suddenly, time stops. The DM describes that the caster is so hasted that she's currently moving at the speed of light, whilst the rest of us are \"paused\" for 3 rounds. \n\nDM is generous and rules that, despite there not being any heat she will survive and we ask what she can do. I point out that, since time has paused, things like mass don't exist, so she can move things (within reason) at will without worrying about weight. So she kindly moves my T-rex onto the ship for me. \n\nShe then asks if she can swing the ship, hammer throw wind up style, to eviscerate the dragon. So we spent a good amount of time working out how this would work without her killing everyone on the ship. We also had to look into quantum physics to see if she could still fly with time being stopped (since there's no such thing as infinite gravity, it was ruled she could.) We work out that, if she grabbed the back end of the ship, swung it round 360 degrees, for those standing on the ship it wouldn't make a difference as the floor moved away and back we wouldnt be effected. DM was also gracious enough to allow any necessary crew to survive, including our feared teammates below deck. \n\nSo the Caster grabs the railing on the rear of the ship and, with pretty much no effort, swings the ship around. We also worked out that the amount of force she swung with (force = mass x acceleration, using a 45000ton warship for mass, and speed of light for acceleration) hit the dragon with 13,490,660,610,000 tons of force. \n\nAt this point, she gives birth. So in the midst of swinging a ship into a dragon, which reduced it into a bloodied powder so fine we actually didn't see any remains after time caught up, the Caster had actually popped a baby out. \n\nTime resumed, all our characters are confused as shit, and the Caster is just cradling a dangerous combination of celestial hellspawn God only knows what else. \n\nWe all just kind of sat there for a moment taking in what the fuck just happened irl, with the DM taking in how we'd completely messed with the world he'd created in order to beat a dragon, before we went on.\n\nThe baby was a child of prophecy. The Kobold sorcerer fused itself with the wind elemental he'd summoned and has now essentially become an air elemental God. My druid had a psychotic break and the baby has tainted her soul, making her truly neutral (she can change alignment at will in order to suit her needs). Her T-Rex is now sentient but loyal, still gaining the benefits of being a companion whilst being smart enough to act as her own character. \n\nAnd the caster got some slightly bigger boobs.\n\nAll in all, it was a pretty crazy, super fucked up session. And we now have two potential BBEGs for our future campaign\n",

It was time to let the virtual DM run wild again.\n\nThe party found the captured villagers from Paku and Pehkeiai imprisoned beneath the temple, waiting to be sacrificed to Tiamat. Inalak, Jaques, and Tikka set off to escort them back to their homes, while the rest of the Tsethem traveled with the army back to Little Orthraze. A celebratory banquet was summarily prepared for them, because Gnomes will take any excuse to throw a party.\n\nIt was in the middle of the festivities that Tiseo asked Della if he could have a private word with her. Stepping inside one of the nearby shops, he revealed that one of the Tsethem (I never found out which one) had mentioned the Forever Stone in passing. Tiseo had been the one to originally suggest Della investigate the Stone's existence. But when she had obtained it and found out its function, she had elected to keep its discovery a secret. Tiseo wasn't happy that she had lied to him. What's more, he demanded she hand over the artifact at once.\n\nShe refused, naturally. As far as she knew, the forever stone was the only thing keeping Vindicus around. He'd earned the chance to redeem himself by helping take down the dragon cultists, and she wasn't going to take that away from him. So Tiseo struck her across the face. \n\nNow, Mythic has a sort of \"random event\" system, which activates at certain points. Most of the time they change the current adventure somewhat, adding complications or boons, new NPCs, or other such twists. But there have been a few of them over the years that have sent the whole narrative spiraling into the unknown, a single dice roll that sends shockwaves of consequence throughout the world. This was one of those moments, which I later dubbed \"pivot points\". \n\nTiseo began to change. His face swelled up and warped, his armor snapping off as his stature grew. Fire burst from his eyes, and he screamed in pain. Della was panicking a bit. She'd seen pictures of the creature Tiseo was morphing into, and she wasn't prepared to fight one. Because what stood before her was a pit fiend, an incredibly dangerous devil from the depths of the nine hells. The rest of the Tsethem would step in to help, but Dell might be crushed in the first few rounds. I mentally sighed and prepared for a battle across the village of Little Orthraze. \n\n* * *\n\nAnd he rolled a natural one. First attack, first turn of combat. The pit fiend rose to his full height, smacked his head against the roof of the Gnome-sized hut, and collapsed on the floor. Tiseo shrank back to his usual form with a hiss. His eyes were scorched and all his hair had been burnt off. He wasn't going anywhere soon, and good thing too, because Della was in shock. \n\nThe rest of the team eventually found them and locked Tiseo up. Korena interrogated him with *Zone of Truth* while Flamer comforted Dell. Tiseo didn't know what had happened to him, but he guessed it was some kind of possession. That seems weird enough, for the high priest to be targeted by a devil. So Korena started asking questions about his loyalties. \n\nAnd the penny dropped: Tiseo was the traitor. Not only that, he'd been responsible for the whole dragon cult. During the Great War he'd discovered the existence of a prophecy that predicted the coming of Tiamat. The carvings stated that only the most faithful to the Living Weapon would be granted respite from her wrath. Normally Tiseo would have dismissed this as fanatic lunacy, just like the myriad of other doom-mongers on the island. But this was different; It was written by one of the Supreme One's prophets, which made it gospel for Tiseo. \n\nHe became obsessed with finding a way to survive the coming draconic apocalypse. He researched lichdom, arcane cloning, and reincarnation. Anything to make himself immortal. He even manipulated Della into forming her team to find the Forever Stone. He'd covertly started and controlled the dragon cult from behind the scenes, working toward what he believed to be the inevitable coming of Tiamat. He thought he had it in the bag. But he hadn't counted on the sheer might of the Tsethem united under one cause. \n\nThe one thing he denied involvement in was the attack of the shadow dragon. He didn't know why she'd decided to lay Orthraze to ruin. Or why the Mirlings had come to her aid, only to turn on her when Imix showed up. This worried some of the more suspicious minded of the team, because it meant someone else had coordinated the attack. He said he'd investigated the dragon's motives, to see whether his cult could regain any control over her. But the only thing he'd found when venturing into her throne room was a symbol, carved by a dragon claw into the wall and hidden by perpetual shadow: a symbol of an eye. The same one that had led Flamer and co to investigate the elemental cultists. The one carved into the foreheads of the two adventurer's I'd hardly had a chance to play. The elder eye was still out there, and had been in cahoots with the dragon. \n\nThey locked Tiseo up in the ruins of Orthraze, leaving him cursing their names as he stared at their retreating forms with sightless eyes. No one dared venture into the ruins any more, due to the spirits and Mirlings infesting the place. Tiseo had enough magic to create simple food for himself, but escape was pretty much impossible. The traitor was found, the culprit locked away. Peace could return to the island or Tirkosu once again. \n\n* * *\n\nThus began the age of the Tsethem. They were heroes, celebrities even. Those who had only been been honorary members of the team were granted full protector status by their respective villages. The elves were more than happy to have Tikka as their guardian, as her father was already chief. Inalak's innate connection with storms and the waves made him an instant hit in Pehkeiai. Naliko was asked to come back into her tribe by the Golaths, which she accepted without any sense of begrudgement or \"I told you so\"; to her, it made sense that they'd cast her out into the cold for being weak, and she bore no malice against them for doing so. Jaques was named Tsethem of Gokapu, the dusty village housing the remnant of the human empire's elite. He didn't spend much time there, as he and Tikka were married seven months later. They spent much of their time in the flying tower, which had become the Tsethem HQ. Mobile bases are something I really like, so I was ecstatic that the cozy tower also served as a fortress from which they launched their missions. \n\nMeanwhile, the temple of Appinamopu had taken a huge blow in the eyes of the other villages, thanks to Tiseo's betrayal. He had been the high priest after all, so to find out that he was behind the attacks didn't shine the Tharth in a good light. Luckily for them, Korena (who had been named Tsethem of Light) was quick to send out as much help as she could spare, to aid in rebuilding the affected villages and returning life to normal. Since Tiseo was a heretic, Della was elected as the high priestess. \n\nVindicus... Ah, Vind. Ever attempting to be the tragic brooder, but so often ending up as a clown instead. He was named Tsethem of smoke by the Elkore, but instead of hanging around D'Okai he sulked off into the forest down south. Where he promptly met a band of ex-druids, found a substance called Dreamroot, and spent the next few months high off his head. I think he was trying to deal with his newly found immortality, and lack of purpose. He was supposed to be finding a way to get rid of his undead nature. But instead he ended up slumped against a tree, smoking weeds with a bunch of hippies. \n\nFlamer was sorely disappointed that the Warforged that had joined the dragon cult. There were only a couple of hundred remaining, the rest having been slain in the charge on Tiamat's temple. Veetoo was let off with an order to give a public apology. This might seem weird, given how she basically tried to help kill everyone, but you have to remember that the Warforged were like family. They were comrades who fought alongside each other in the Great War, mere years ago. And their numbers had thinned drastically, with no chance of repopulation. Flamer was worried for his people. He started searching for a way to build new Warforged, and tried to get Lundal to help; Lund had worked with magitek in the past, after all. But the Tsethem of steam was becoming more and more depressed, dwelling on the genie's wish that he'd refused; dwelling on what could have been...\n\nA few incidents occurred during the following year, of only minor significance. The Tsethem, sans Vindicus, responded to all of them in record time thanks to the mobility and speed afforded by the flying tower. Giant dryads rampaged incoherently around Paku, famine plagued Gokapu due to an increase in dust storms, and the Golath decided to ban the other \"inferior\" races from their village. These were all dealt with efficiently. Everything was running smoothly on the island of Tirkosu.\n\nAnd then I picked up Curse of Strahd. Goodbye fun times, hello darkness my old friend. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nBit of a shorter part today, because the next one is going to be a long one.",

        "text": "Natural Selection 2 is a good game. It's kind of a mix between a First Person Shooter and a Real Time Strategy. You've got two commanders, one on both teams, and they place buildings, research upgrades and (if they're any good) co-ordinate team movements. One team play standard Marine types, standard FPS gameplay, while the other team plays the Kharaa, a collection of Zerg like aliens.\n\nSo, I used to play a lot of NS2. Don't really anymore, none of my friends play it and the community is pretty small. But I played it a lot circa 2015. One of those matches I find really memorable. \n\nThe Match starts like any other. Pick a team, in my case the marines, and start off in one of 4 starting spots, in this case a room called \"Control\". [Here's a map of Kodiak, if anyone wants a reference](http://s21.postimg.org/4hv4yafjb/ns2_Kodiak_Minimap.png). Choose a commander, commander begins to build the starting buildings. The Marines split up into three groups. Two marines stayed in Control to build the armory, and two groups of three would capture the resource nodes in Hydroponics and Central Biodome. I was in the Biodome team. \n\nIt is in Central Biodome that we make first contact with the enemy. There are five morphs of Kharaa the aliens can use, but in the start Alien players will only be able to use the starting Skulks (Fragile Melee Units, but small and mobile), or evolving to the Gorge (Engineer Aliens, effectively). As such, the group of four that attacked us was composed exclusively of the small bitey skulks. Four Skulks versus Three Marines, in a relatively open space, this was in our favour. At least it should have been. One of the Marines split off from us to chase a retreating Skulk and got mauled by one that was hiding in the bushes, and all we heard from his mic was static.\n\nThat's not a gameplay thing by the way, he just had a shitty Mic setup. \n\nI managed to take out one of the Skulks, but we pulled back from the Resource Node onto a bridge that crossed a small stream. I made a stupid error, and fell backwards into the stream, separating me from my ally. Typically, in a 1v1 Skulk versus Marine conflict, the Skulk will win. Since both Marines in Central Biodome were separated, both of us were easy pickings. By the time more Marines showed up we had both been killed. \n\nThe team in Hydroponics had much better luck. They established a node in the room and moved on to try and capture Hangar Bay, wherein they were slaughtered by Skulks. \n\nThis is about a minute of elapsed game time, but it's kind of important. The Aliens were very aggressive very early on and managed to stymie our early growth and expansion. Effectively speaking they managed to slow down our initial development, and prevented us from getting a steady flow of resources in the beginning. We didn't really recover.\n\nNow, it took about five minutes for us to lose the game. We consistently failed to secure resource nodes, and we lacked the flow of resources to keep up with the Alien team, while the Alien team managed to capture most of the Nodes on the map, while they cornered us in our small parcel of map. \n\nThe game wasn't over yet, our Command Center was still active, and we still had a bit of a resource flow. So, we stuck it out. And so Began the Siege of Control\n\n----\n\nOur first priority in the Siege of Control was walls. We built two walls. The first wall was made of Corpses, and was unfortunately metaphorical. Corpses in NS2 lack collision physics and disappear after a while. But until the second, much better wall was made, we sent Soldiers out to be brutally slaughtered to buy us time.\n\nThe second wall was a workaround. NS2 doesn't have a building for the purposes of walling off rooms, not on the human side. But we made do. We built robotics factories around the two doorways into Control, that blocked the lower half of the doorway. These essentially served as fortifications that could block out the less mobile Aliens, and slow the more mobile ones down enough for us to kill them. We also built a similar fortification around the Power Node using armories. If the Aliens destroyed the powernode, our Infantry Portals would stop working and we wouldn't be able to respawn when we died.\n\nThese walls were surprisingly effective, but I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to their effectiveness or to the Aliens not figuring them out. While Skulks, Fades and Lerks could still access the base, Gorges and Onos would have to destroy the walls to get in. The good news for us was that the aliens that could bypass the walls were mostly anti-Infantry, while the building destroyers were slowed down by the walls. Them being slowed meant we could get up on the walls with our rifles and put enough lead in them to either kill them outright or weaken them enough that they retreated (most of the time).\n\nThe only major downside to the walls was that they sealed non-Jetpack marines out of the base. But nobody would have come back anyways. \n\n----\n\nA notable event during the Siege was the Whip attack. Whips are stationary alien defenses, that attack Marine infantry or buildings in range. They can also be uprooted. They're mostly used as static defenses, since uprooted Whips can't attack.\n\nThat didn't stop them from sending a fucking horde of the things to break at the Southern Wall. I remember heading down the hallway into Southern Biodome and seeing this wall of Tentacles crawling towards me. While the Whips didn't kill me, they overran me and left me stuck in the middle of their numbers, a sitting duck for hostile aliens.\n\nThe Whips were intended to effectively serve as an Alien wall, with their sheer numbers blocking the southern corridor. It was one of the few outside the box strategies the Alien Commander employed to break the siege.\n\nWe managed to clear the hall with grenades, but it was a pretty genuinely scary thing to get up on the Southern Wall (Which admittedly was only about a meter tall) and stare down into the hall to see it almost completely covered in Tentacles. \n\n----\n\nOur finest hour during the Siege was the capture of Docking and Asteroid Tracking. With the resources provided by these rooms we could boost our weaponry, and begin to combat the Snowball effect. So, about half the team went to Docking.\n\nThe Aliens were setting up to build a Hive here, but with the power of Lead and Gunpowder, we managed to prevent it's construction. We had a Drone begin construction on a Phase Gate, while our marines prepared for the counterattack. The Marines still defending Control noticed that the aliens were pulling back a bit, and soon after they came crashing into Asteroid tracking. \n\nTwo Onos led the charge. The Defenders at Asteroid Tracking did their best, they actually managed to drop one of the Onos, but the Aliens had greater numbers and more powerful troops, and it seemed like the whole Asteroid Tracking and Docking venture was a wasted effort.\n\nThis is the point when Command finished researching EXO suits. We sent our EXOs through the gate, and managed to beat back the remaining aliens, and secure Asteroid Tracking/Docking. \n\nIt was almost like something out of an action film, the last wounded survivors seem to stand no chance, and then the Cavalry comes in at the last second to save the day. Except the aliens gathered their strength, evolved a couple more onos, and then took back Asteroid Tracking and Docking. \n\n-----\n\nDuring the Siege, Hydroponics was the most hotly contested zone. Control remained pretty comfortably in the control of the Marines until the end, and excepting the push at Asteroid Tracking the aliens never really lost ground. But Hydroponics flipped between alien control and human control up until the end.\n\nI'd argue it helped us more than it helped the aliens. Our attempts to recapture Hydroponics, whether they were successful or not, helped divide the attention of our enemy. If they were able to focus their undivided attention on Control, they'd probably have been able to break our defenses, but our constant pushing on Hydroponics ensured they couldn't dedicate all their resources to their offensives.\n\n-----\n\nUltimately the Siege of Control lasted for One Hour and Twenty-Seven Minutes. Our goal was to stick it out for as long as we could, we were hoping for an Hour. \n\nEventually our defenses broke. The Alien Commander sent a small group of skulks and lerks to eliminate the Drones that maintained our walls, and with our limited resource flow (Hydroponics was under alien control at the time) it would take a while to replace them.\n\nThe Eastern Wall was destroyed, and a pair of Onos charged in. Our Exos made a noble effort to push them back, but they weren't a match for fully upgraded Onos with constant gorge healing, and our Exos were smashed. The southern wall fell soon after, to another pair of Onos. This was the first time the aliens were able to simultaneously break our walls, and it signaled that this was the end.\n\nOur base was laid out in such a way that the infantry portals were rather hard to access from the enemy side, so we were able to keep respawning for a bit, but the base had been overrun. We downed a few of the Onos, but they never ran out, and eventually a Skulk found our power node.\n\nWithout a constant stream of soldiers, the aliens were able to destroy the Command Center. And with that, the game was won for the aliens.",

This is the story of my ongoing campaign. We're roughly two months into the game in real life time, and three years in-world. What's happened so far? A bunch of dragon cultists are planning on summoning Tiamat. No spoilers for RoT, as I had to modify the adventure a lot.\n\n* * *\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/767n9h/my_experiences_playing_solo_dd/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76en9o/my_continued_experiences_playing_solo_dd/) \n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/79nl1f/playing_solo_what_happens_when_the_virtual_dm/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7aliy8/playing_solo_aftermath/)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7dkb20/playing_solo_you_can_never_have_enough_characters/)\n\n[A brief transcription of how solo D&amp;D works](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76ym0f/playing_solo_a_transcription/) \n* * *\n\nThe Council of Little Orthraze consisted of a representative from each village and the Tsethem, honorary and otherwise. Their topic of discussion was basically \"what do we do about the dragon cultists?\" The answer may seem obvious, and it was to the Tsethem: take them out. Give them the same treatment as the elemental cultists before them, who I'd named \"Primadans\" for their worship of the Primordials; ancient and powerful elementals composed of two types, Archomentals and Colossi. Imix, the being Flamer had summoned before the fall of Orthraze, was one of the former kind.\n\nBut the council elders, led by the high priest Tiseo, countered that it wasn't so simple. They had no idea of the opposition's numbers, they were clueless as to where their base of operations lay, and apparently they had dragons on their side. These were all issues that had to be addressed before an assault could be attempted, otherwise they would be going in blind. They needed intelligence. \n\nSo Tiseo split the party. Turf and Flamer were sent off into the ruined Orthraze to check out  the teleportation circle the cultists had used, in the hopes of figuring out where their HQ was located. No dice on that, it was simply a two-way spatial portal. The two ran into a bunch of Mirlings on the way there, and spent some time trying to figure out where they came from. Flamey thought they were manifestations of the evil that permeated the ruins, and Turf speculated they were souls trapped in their own little hell.\n\nLundal, Della, Korena and Inalak were all shipped out on the flying tower to check out an anonymous tip Tiseo had received, concerning the cult's whereabouts. They arrived at this weird, extradimensional fort held by a crazed wizard only a few had heard of. Unfortunately the cultists had gotten there ahead of the heroes, and killed the owner. Upon further exploration of the place however, Lundal found a fire genie locked up and contained in an antimagic field. The genie offered him a wish if he let him go. It took every shred of resolve Lund had to say no.\n\nYou see, Lundal wasn't stupid. He knew that wishes are always a dangerous thing to be messing with, and that accepting a wish from a genie was tantamount to suicide. Wish for a million gold pieces? Bam, you just got crushed by them. Wish for limitless good luck? Then \"good luck\" is the only thing you'll ever be able to say, ever again. Lund had listened to tales of foolish people who'd asked genies for wishes, only to be doomed forever by their own greed.\n\nBut Lundal didn't want gold, or fame, or luck. He was content with his worldly possessions. He wanted something that no amount of wealth could ever get him: Nora. The woman he'd named his little octopus familiar after. The only gnome he'd ever loved. The fiancé he had never said goodbye to. She was gone, and despite his bitter mourning he had found new purpose as one of the Tsethem. But the genie had offered him a chance to change the past, and it burned him to his core to walk away from that.\n\n* * *\n\nMeanwhile a smaller group of dragon cultists were being attacked by Vindicus, Naliko, Jaques, and Tikka. They actually had a small water dragon with them, and I was glad to see that they were almost TPKed by it. I was worried that I was playing dragons wrong after the pathetic cakewalk the last ice one had provided. Vindicus interrogated the survivors, which was one of the few moments Naliko allowed him to actually be grimdark and edgy, and he actually wrangled the location of the cultist's HQ out of them; a hidden temple dedicated to Tiamat, situated on the volcano and only a few miles from Karu Sampur. Finally, they could scout out the area and plan an attack. \n\nThere was only one problem; as the three teams returned to Little Orthraze they were met with bad news from Karu Sampur. Apparently a large number of the Warforged living there had rallied under a new leader called Veetoo. She was a prototype for an improved model that was never completed before the Great War ended, and was adept in using arcane magic (differentiated from innate magic by its reliance on energy crystals, runes, and clockwork mechanisms). She'd taken advantage of Flamer's absence to rile her fellow Warforged up against his peaceful coalitions with the other villages, stating that as the most advanced race on the island they should be afforded more respect, especially given their part in winning the Great War.\n\nThis was concerning in the long run for Flamey, as he didn't want a whole \"rise of the machines\" thing to happen. But the more pressing matter was whether Veetoo and her supporters were going to interfere with the attack on the dragon cult. Tiseo had been compiling an army from the surrounding villages and was preparing them for the coming fight. If the Warforged intended to interfere with the landing on the volcano, Tiseo needed to know.\n\nTurf, Dell, and Flamer headed to Karu Sampur to negotiate. Lundal wasn't feeling up for it, so Korena went along in his stead. They met with Veetoo in her cave, now dubbed her throne room. She told them she was considering which side to join, the united villages or the dragon cultists, and that her decision would be based off who was more likely to win the coming battle. She demanded to know details of their battle formations and tactics. They didn't have much choice, so they gave her the lowdown. She didn't seem impressed, but told them she would take time to consider and give her verdict the next day. \n\nOnly she never got the chance, because Flamer used Tree Stride to get the team out before dawn broke. Turf and Korena had been mentally attacked during the night and tortured for more information. They learned in their dreams that Veetoo had already joined sides with the cultists. She had been secretly training a select number of Warforged in the arcane arts, and had sent them to aid the cult in their ultimate goal: the summoning of Tiamat.\n\nFlamer and Co waited at little Orthraze for the rest of the Tsethem to return. They had all been sent off by Tiseo to various locations, for reasons which I can't remember. What I do remember about them was that they were all so trivial. I think the one Jaques and Tikka had was about searching for lore on Tiamat. They learned that:\n\n1. She had been created before the island even existed, by some creature named Nekrahtrox, to be a living weapon. \n2. She had five heads corresponding to an element, earth fire water air, and shadow.\n3. She had been banished to the nine hells by the Colossi. \n4. The ancient carvings of her drew her with stupidly long whiskers.\n\nThis was interesting and all, but wasn't useful. It wasn't information they could use to defeat her, if worse came to the worst. And the rest of the team had been sent on similarly trivial expeditions. Jaques in particular was fed up, because he felt they were being shunted around to keep them out of the limelight.\n\nOut of game, I knew they had a traitor in their midst. Someone on the council was working to give the cultists some extra time before the battle. And I had no clue who it was.\n\nCharlotta Veil was representing the Humans on the council, but while she had been acting a little more violent lately due to her reincarnation as a half-orc, I couldn't really see her being the traitor. Tiseo was the most influential of the elders, but he was also the high priest of the Hopefuls; you couldn't get that kind of position if you were secretly evil. Gert, the elder Gnome of Little Orthraze, was also a friend of Lundal, and I wasn't sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. The rest seemed just as unlikely to be working for the cultists.\n\nThere was no time to start a detective sidequest though, because time was of the essence. The different parties reunited on the shore of the sand belt, facing the volcano. The army they were heading was pretty huge by Tirkosu standards, and they had the advantage of air superiority thanks to the flying tower. They knew they would meet resistance from the Warforged, but they were ready for them. They crossed onto the volcano via a tidal causeway and started the march up the slopes. \n\nThe cultists struck. Their numbers were less than half the united villages, but they still had the upper hand: four adult dragons of various elemental affiliations soared overhead, breathing destruction down on the attackers. The battle begun in earnest, and soon the Tsethem were right in the thick of it.\n\nThey worked together perfectly. The virtual DM was throwing challenging combatant after challenging combatant at them, and they simply bounced back. Turf was tearing through the enemies with her meat cleaver of a sword, while Lundal used his exosuit for maximum efficiency. Della's dual-wielding of staff and *Spiritual Weapon* was actually matching Turf in damage output. Flamer soared through the air like a beefy Johnny Storm, wrestling dragons to the ground for Inalak to polymorph into frogs. Jaques and Tikka were highly affective together, the wild and ferocious slashes of his wristblades complimented by her more refined rapier maneuvers. Naliko helped Korena down another dragon foolish enough to try and pick them up, as Vindicus sliced through cultists with a bridaled, focused rage. Up above, the archers inside the floating tower stuck the final dragon full of arrows and sent it crashing onto the rocks below.\n\nThe Tsethem continued up the volcano while the stragglers were being rounded up below. Upon reaching one of the secondary cones they discovered a large structure composed of obsidian and volcano rock, looking like a cathedral build of melted black plastic. Inside were about ten Warforged in the process of casting the summoning ritual, and the head of the cult himself floating above them all. I was gearing up for the fight of a lifetime.\n\nAnd the Tsethem absolutely banana pureed them. The Warforged were turned into scrap within rounds. Flamer went nova and slam dunked the head cultist into the ground, killing him instantly. They never even learned his name.\n\nBut unlike the previous anticlimactic final battle, the one against the ice dragon, I was okay with it. Just the charge up the volcano had been enough to batter them about enough, so the victory didn't feel totally unearned. And yes, they'd breezed through what should have been a tough challenge (four dragons are four dragons, after all), but... These guys were Tsethem. They were the protectors of the elements. A year ago they would have crumpled under the pressure. But now they stood strong.\n\nThey took a moment to catch their breath outside Tiamat's temple. The sun was setting, casting that familiar orange glow over the island. Their home was safe from the tyranny of dragons.\n\nVind took off his helmet. I don't think anyone one except Della and Naliko knew who he really was before this. His armor literally covered everything except his eyes, and his voice was so hoarse it was unrecognizable. So most of the others were shocked when he revealed his true identity.\n\nGrayson Strell. Former Grand High Commander of the military. Died in battle to take down Imix, after the fall of Orthraze. He stood there before them, gaunter and greyer than before. In his last moments on that fateful battlefield, after he had seen Charlotta fall beside him, he had been visited by a demon and offered a chance to get his revenge on those who had destroyed the empire. He accepted and became a revenant, neither alive nor dead. \n\nThe next year was spent hunting down individual cultists and trying to uncover more of their plot. He learned that they had brought the shadow dragon to the island long ago in the hopes that she would help them. When she refused they left her locked away underground, and she lay there undisturbed until the Tsethem came along. The dragon cult had been responsible for the destruction of everything Strell stood for. And now, with their numbers thinned and their leaders crushed, his thirst for vengeance was slated.\n\nAnd as his purpose as a revenant had been fulfilled, it was time for him to go. \n\nDella wasn't giving up on him that easily. She gave him her pendant, which turned out to contain the Forever Stone. I wasn't sure it would work, as while the stone is supposed to keep people alive, Vind technically was already dead. But the vDM seemed to think it was good enough, so he didn't waste away and vanish into the nine hells. He thanked Della and swore to use his immortality for the greater good. \n\nAnd thus ended the Rise of Tiamat. Or to be more accurate, the Brief Mention of Tiamat. But although the officlal module was over, the virtual DM still had some threads to play with. Why were the cultists obsessed with bringing the Living Weapon into the world? Was there really a traitor on the council? Will Vindicus pluck up the courage to talk to Charlotta again? Find out next time on Eastenders. Although the answer to the last question was obvious: he didn't want her to see him as an undead. Hence the concealing armor.\n\nI'll put this chapter to bed with a quote from Turf's actual memoirs:\n\n&gt; As we stepped out into the night, with the lava pouring down the sides of the volcano and a chill wind cooling our adrenaline-filled bodies, we all finally understood: the elements were ours to protect. Not just because our villages needed leadership, or because we felt it was our duty. It was our destiny to safeguard our people against the forces of elemental evil. Since the dawn of our times, we had been waiting for this moment. \n\n&gt; We were the Tsethem. \n\n&gt; The Protectors of the world. ",

        "text": "I posted this originally in r/Skyrim And was recommended in the comments to put it here too. I’ll leave a link to the original post below\n\nToday I had perhaps the craziest experience ever in Skyrim. Warning: this story is ridiculous and very long. \n\nBefore I start the story, I should probably explain the mods I have installed, as they’re what caused the madness you’re about to read:\n I have a mod that makes between 1 and 3 dragons attack cities.\n I have a mod that generates massive bandit raids on cities and adds in “mercenary guards” to defend cities from them. The mercenary guards look exactly like regular ones, except they stay outside the city walls and wear steel armor. \nFinally I’ve a mod that adds alarm bells into all the main cities, that are sounded when the city is under attack. It makes civilians run away and hide and it puts all the guards on high alert.\n\nSo I’d just reached Markarth, and was off to get some of the bloodiest beef in the Reach, and at the gates of the city there was a massive bandit raid going on. A good 30 bandit archers, raiders and mages were fighting around 25 mercenary guards and 15ish regular guards. It was nuts. Me being me, I grabbed my bow and started helping the guards.\n\nAbout halfway through the battle, I accidentally shot a mercenary guard. As they’re not part of the regular guards, I got no bounty. However it did turn all the mercenary guards hostile towards me...\n \nSo when the bandits were finally dealt with, every single mercenary guard instantly turned hostile and ran at me screaming shit like “YOU’LL MAKE A FINE RUG, CAT” and “YOU DON’T STAND A CHANCE!” I stood no chance at all; there were at least 20 of the bastards, all heavily armored and armed with dwarven weapons. So naturally I legged it into the city. \n\nThis is where it gets really crazy. \n\nAs I enter Markarth, followed by 20+ angry mercenary guards, not one dragon, not two, but THREE dragons swoop from the sky and start attacking the city. The alarm bell is sounded, the civilians all go nuts, and every single guard in the city goes on high alert.\n\nIt was utter carnage. Half the mercenary guards got caught up in the dragon attack, the other half kept chasing me and all the while fire is raining from the sky and civilians are running around like headless chicken. All the regular city guards are going mad too, trying to kill 3 dragons at once. \n\nI managed to lead the mercenary guards that were still on my tail up to the highest point in the city, where I Fus Ro Dah’d them all off a ledge into the market below. That left me with 3 dragons and half of the mercenary guards on my ass.\n\nSomehow during the battle, one of the mercenary guards had hit a regular Markarth guard. So now the two guard factions were fighting each other, and the 2 remaining dragons (one had been killed at this point).\n\n Never in my life have I seen so much carnage. 15ish mercenary guards VS all of the Markarth guards VS 2 dragons ALL AT ONCE! I managed to take out one of the other dragons and a couple of mercenary guards, while the guards took care of the other dragon (and each other.)\n\nWhen the three dragons were finally dead, the two factions of guards turned all of their attention to the other faction, and slaughtered each other in the streets. As the dragons were all dead, the alarm bell stopped sounding and all the citizens came out from their hiding places, idly stood by and watched the guards have a full on civil war with each other.\n\nIn the end, only I and one other regular Markarth guard survived. He looked at me, said “heard about you and your honeyed words,” and walked off to continue his lonely  patrol. I came away from the experience with 3 dragon souls, and 5 inheritance letters. That’s right. FIVE.\n\nTo top it all off, none of the mercenary guards bodies will de-spawn, and for some reason one of the dragons skeletons hasn’t either. So now every time I come back to Markarth, there are bodies littered all over the market place, the skeleton of a dragon sitting outside Cidhna mine and civilians walking around saying “oh, what happened?” And “what a waste!”\n\nAbsolutely fucking nuts.\n\nOriginals post: https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/7e9za3/markarth_went_absolutely_nuts_craziest_experience/?st=JA8I65GD&amp;sh=0afee7f1",

This is the story of my ongoing campaign. We're roughly two months into the game in real life time, and three years in-world. What's happened so far? Well... The hub of \"modern\" civilisation was obliterated, so everyone is now living in little villages all over the island.\n\n* * *\n\n**The story so far: A shadow dragon obliterated a city, pretty much.**\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/767n9h/my_experiences_playing_solo_dd/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76en9o/my_continued_experiences_playing_solo_dd/) \n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/79nl1f/playing_solo_what_happens_when_the_virtual_dm/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7aliy8/playing_solo_aftermath/)\n\n[A brief transcription of how solo D&amp;D works](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76ym0f/playing_solo_a_transcription/) \n\n* * *\n\nIt was around this time that I picked up Horde of the Dragon Queen, and Rise of Tiamat shortly after. I was eager to run it, but Flamer and co. were much too powerful for the recommended level. I was still not too speedy at adjusting encounters to fit different party levels, so I decided to take a short break from the main heroes and roll up some new characters.\n\nJaques Torrem had lost both of his parents in the bombing of Rahg Krahv. He and his little sister had moved to Orthraze to get away from the cultist threat. I actually ran him and his sis through a mini adventure just before the picnic episode, in which Captain Veil recruited them to head into the city's catacombs and figure out where the corpse of a flumph had come from. Tragically, Jaques was the only one who made it out alive. Losing the last other member of his family like that would have probably pushed him over the edge, if he hadn't met Tikka.\n\nTikka had the perfect mindset of an Elf. Bubbly, vivacious, brimming with life and the love of it. She was the daughter of the Elven chieftain, and as she was destined to inherit the mantle of leadership her father had sent her to Orthraze to get a proper education. While she didn't completely cure Jacques' depression, she did manage to stop him from becoming suicidal.\n\nThen Orthraze fell. The two were among those who were captured by the Mirlings, and they survived the imprisonment by keeping each other's spirits up. With the final attack on Imix came freedom for the Mirlings' captives, Jaques and Tikka leading the escape from the shadow-haunted ruins. They spent the next year together, working through Jaques' depression and helping the survivors settle.\n\nThis is when the story picks up again, one year after the fall of Orthraze. Something weird was going on; people were being bumped off, seemingly at random. The only thing the deaths had in common was that the victims all worshiped Tiamat, the mythical five headed dragon. Word was spreading that some kind of judgment was coming for anyone who believed in her. So swift and discreet were the killings that they didn't even have a description or name of the culprit, so naturally the bards of the island got inventive, naming him \"the Vindicus\". Tikka decided they needed a skilled tracker to have the slightest chance of a lead, so that led to the introduction of the third new character.\n\nNaliko \"Icestalker\" Lakumathala was literally raised by wolves. Golath, the icefolk living on the slopes of Mt. Tirkosu, have a brutal survival of the fittest mentality. Any newborn child that isn't physically up to their standards would usually be given away to a foster home. A trip downmountain was too too much of a wasted effort for Naliko's parents however, and she was unceremoniously dumped in the wilderness to die.\n\nSo the clichéd \"wolf takes her into the pack instead of eating her\" backstory happens. Basically Mowgli, but in the freezing cold instead of the jungle. She worked as a hunter and tracker, and that's how she wound up with Jaques and Tikka.\n\nTheir first meeting was quite funny to play through. Unlike most of my adventure starting points, it actually made sense that they would meet in a pub, so I could check that off the list of tropes I'd used. While Jaques and Tikka were relatively normal, Naliko was certainly not. She had a kind of rambling way of talking, and would stare dreamily at anyone except who she was speaking to. The other two didn't really know how to deal with her, because although her age was only twelve she was talking about quite serious stuff like she was an adult (I.E. tracking, killing, wages, etc). One moment sticks out in particular, when they were sitting by the frosted window of the mountainside tavern:\n\nJaques: Does two gold pieces per day sound fair?\n\nNaliko: (*Pauses*) Yes, that would be nice. I like gold. It can get you drunk. I like drunk.\n\nJaques: (*Nervously laughs*) Ah hah, yeah... One moment. \n\n(*Jaques rises from the table, and walks over to where Tikka is ordering at the bar*)\n\nJaques: Tikka... Um... What are we getting ourselves into, here?\n\n(*Both turn and look at Naliko, who stares back and slowly waves at them from across the room*)\n\n* * *\n\nThe two Tyranny of Dragons modules were the hardest I've ever had to adapt to fit the setting of Tirkosu. Mostly because of the scale of the thing: a whole lot of it is just travel, and that's pretty hard to pull off when you're on an island that's only a hundred miles across. In fact, I threw most of it out the window and let the virtual DM run the show. For instance, the beginning scene had a totally different structure to the one in the book. I won't go into spoilers here, but those who have read or played the adventure will see the difference. \n\nThey started out on a stormy beach, overlooking the waterfolk village of Pehkeiai. The rafts and stilted huts that constituted the settlement were being buffeted about by the tall waves that broke through the protective reef. A storm was coming, both literally and metaphocically. \nAnd there he was. Staring out to sea with both feet planted firmly in the sand, his black plate armor shining in the fine misty rain. Naliko could sense that this was her quarry: the man who had been killing Tiamat's followers. The Vindicus. \n\nAnd then all hell broke loose. Hundreds of men and women charged onto the beach from the jungle, screeching and roaring as they brandished their many weapons. More burst from the choppy water and swarmed up onto the village, swiftly followed by scaly wyrm-like creatures. They began hacking their way into the huts and forcing the inhabitants out at swordpoint. As Jaques, Tikka, and Naliko ran to defend the villagers against the bandits, Vindicus looked to the heavens and drew his blade, masked face fixed on the giant blue dragon circling above.\n\nI ran the battle as a kind of skirmish, with multiple smaller fights working together to create the sense of a large scale battle. Vindicus waited until the dragon got in range, then eldritch blasted the loving daylights out of it until it retreated. The other three took down multiple raiders, but were otherwise kind of ineffectual. Eventually the attackers retreated, taking most of the village's wealth and about a quarter of the population as prisoners. Vindicus went off after them, without stopping for a break.\n\nThe rest of the party (because yeah, Vindicus was actually supposed to be character number four) took a moment to catch their breath before heading back into the jungle. It was easy for Naliko to track the huge raiding party back to their camp, but it was much more of a challenge to get inside without being immediate spotted and swarmed. Jaques and Tikka decided to head to Appinamopu Tharth to get reinforcements, while Nali scouted around the perimeter and ran into Vindicus. They introduced themselves, in a manner of speaking, and Vind explained in as few words as he could that he was killing cultists, specifically those who worshiped Tiamat. He didn't know why the bandits had attacked Pehkeiai, he just knew that they needed to die. Naliko took that with a nod and a shrug. It seemed like a good enough answer to her.\n\nThe other two arrived back with some holy warriors from the Tharth, including the high priest of the Supreme One's church. Tiseo was an Aasimar, or angelfolk as they're called on the island, and he was the one who originally gave Della the idea of forming a team to go artifact hunting in the ancient Dwarven mines. By the time they got to the camp however, the cultists had already set off north, heading for the the Elven village of Paku. Naliko had convinced the Vindicus to wait until the other two arrived, thankfully; I didn't want this party to fall apart before it even started.\n\nThey pursued the cultists northwards, clinging to the coast until the tracks branched off and headed for Paku. Upon reaching the jungle village they found it in complete chaos, their quarry having raided the place on their way through. Gold and humble treasures had been seized, and multiple captives had been taken. Jaques talked with the chief (Tikka's father), while Tikka herself tended to the wounded.\n\nAt this point I decided to add two more PCs to the party. Don't ask me why, I don't even remember. Maybe it's because I wanted to suffer. Although that doesn't really ring true, because I was getting a lot quicker at running battles. Regardless, two new PCs came to fruition:\n\nInalak Onakea was a thirty year old Elven sorcerer from Paku. His parents had just been killed defending their home, and he was out for revenge. Korena Ionu was one of the holy warriors Tiseo had brought from the Tharth, who practically worshiped Della and was excited about getting to go on an adventure like her hero.\n\nThey continued the pursuit around the foothills of Mt. Tirkosu, stopping off at the village of smoke. The Elkore inhabitants admired Vind's gothic-style armor, fussing over him as a welcome guest and making him very annoyed. I believe this is where one of my favorite quotes from Naliko came up, in reply to whether Vindicus would be needing any refreshments before retiring:\n\n&gt; \"Oh don't worry about him, he's dead.\"\n\nKeep in mind, Vind hadn't taken off his mask to anyone except Nali at this point, and even she didn't know exactly who he was. I did, because I had planned this from the moment Orthraze fell.\n\nSee, Vindicus was a Revenant. A being who had died, and come back to life for vengeance. The actual race is totally overpowered, as when you die you can automatically come back to life within a few days. It would never be allowed in a game with many people in it. But that's another great thing about playing solo: balance doesn't matter. If you allow a certain character to have more power than the others, you're not going to make the other players feel left out; because there are no other players. The same goes for party levels; I've had level 20 demigods fight alongside level 3 newbies, and it doesn't, *can't* feel unfair. Party balance can be bent a little in favor of narrative coherence or flavor, and it doesn't impact my enjoyment of the game.\n\nAs they finally caught up with the marauding thieves, they gave the slip once again by heading straight into the ruins of Orthraze. This place was basically death for anyone without serious experience, with all the Mirling zombies and tormented ghosts of fallen soldiers milling about. While Korena and Inalak split off from the group to reach Little Orthraze and call a meeting of the Tsethem, the rest continued on through into the shadow-blackened necropolis. Naliko tracked the cultists to an underground series of tunnels, but again they had given the party the slip via a teleport circle.\n\nI was getting quite sick of chasing these people now, so I was thankful when upon activation of the portal we ended up waltzing right into the center of a mountain cabin, filled with cultists. Not the same ones we were after, exactly, but after the fighting died down they could still fill us in on a few details. According to them we had appeared back down in the south, just a few miles from Pernep. They knew that the raiders were headed to a temple of some kind, but they know where it was located. Apparently a prophet had been stirring up trouble among the formerly peaceful worshipers of Tiamat, proclaiming that now was the time for her arrival upon the island. The party's prisoners also knew that several of their brothers were holding the settlement below hostage. So down they went, to defend the villagers.\n\nI don't know what they were expecting, but it certainly wasn't a floating tower. Back when I was playing through PotA with the original Tsethem, they'd been attacked by air cultists from a large turret that floated miles above the ground via a huge elemental propulsion engine. They'd delved into the Dwarven mines just after clearing the tower, and when they returned to the surface it had disappeared. They assumed it had drifted away in the wind. But it wasn't lost, as it's presence over Pernep was testimony to. There were only two problem however: the cultists had taken it over, and they'd invited a dragon.\n\nYou might be deceived by the recent attack on Orthraze into thinking that dragons are a common feature of Tirkosu. They're not, at all. In fact, the fall of Orthraze was the first time one of those creatures had been seen in dacades. Fishermen and waterfolk tell of the far-off dragonlands, a place solely inhabited by the ancient beings. But any solid evidence that such a place existed was nonexistent. Seeing a dragon just perching on top of the flying tower was a scary sight.\n\n...Which was promptly undermined by the easiest dragon fight I've ever experienced. This guy was an adult white dragon, and should have been a deadly challenge for our level. But we cut through him like a knife through cheese. I was only partially miffed by this outcome; this time around I didn't have a magic dagger on hand that could summon an archomental, in the event of the party's dragony death.\n\nWith the raiders having slipped away while the heroes protected Pernep, there was nothing they could do except return to Little Orthraze and consult with the Tsethem. Luckily they had the airship to command. They flew the thing across the island and arrived at the Gnomish town the following morning, greeted by Inalak and Korena, and the Tsethem. Flamer, Turf, Lundal and Della had each been summoned from their respective villages to hold council about the threat of the dragon cult. Flamer was looking as charred and noble as always, as he spoke to the elder Gnome about the village delegates. Turf was now wielding a giant meat cleaver of a blade. Lund was wearing a chunky mechsuit of his own design. And Della was quietly speaking with Korena about the Vindicus. She could sense an aura of evil around the man, but Dell reassured her that he had good intentions, implying that she knew his true identity. Korena was torn between her instincts and the word of her hero, but ultimately decided to let her suspicions lie.\n\nThe six who had pursued the raiders were given honorary Tsethem status, allowing them to participate in the discussion. And with that, the ten heroes gathered together with the elders and chiefs of each village, to hold  the first Council of Little Orthraze. \n\n* * *\n\nNext time: Lundal gets some backstory, the Warforged turn out to be not-so-nice, and I discover that even plenty of setup can't stop a lame villain from falling flat.",

        "text": "I guess that one session of the entire party being assembled was too much awesome for everyone to handle because this week we were back down to four of five players. Oh well, 80% is still a passing grade.\n\nThe Party:\n\nDamien, the LG Paladin - The horrors of the haunted house must have made an impression on him because he’s shifting a bit in his views on the undead. He’s never liked them and has been more than willing to smite them, but now he’s starting to hate them. It’s nice to see a LG character with a bit of darkness.\n\nLuvLock, the NN Warlock - A bit upset with the rest of the party for not taking him seriously. He’s a dark, mysterious character in thrall to a god whose very name drives mere mortals to the brink of sanity and he will be treated as such. Instead, the party treats him like a bit of a looney.\n\nMidir, the NG Gladiator - His alignment has officially shifted to NG. He’s helpful, self sacrificing, and kind. That’s pretty good if you ask me. He also cannot remember anyone’s name or what class they are, leading to humor when he asked “Loveless, the Paladin” about his clerical background.\n\nSir Elvenbeard the Vast, the CN Pirate - Out this week due to work. Turns out our Pirate wants to work in law enforcement IRL. I wonder if his superiors know that he fantasizes about stealing things.\n\nSir Richard Burns, the LN Cleric - Back to more a support role as the Paladin’s right hand man. He’s also very inquisitive, asking good questions to learn more about Barovia.\n\nAfter the horrors of the previous day, the party slept long and hard. They awoke in the morning healed, energetic, and full of a sense that their *experience* in the haunted house yesterday had left them stronger. So they went downstairs and ordered a hearty breakfast from the barman. They also filled in the Fighter and Paladin (who were unconscious last night) about meeting the mysterious stranger outside of the house. The party were puzzling over the identity of the stranger when the Cleric had a flash of insight (plus a bit of prompting from yours truly) and put together several facts.\n\n1. 1) There was a statue in the house that looked like the stranger.    \n2. 2)They had found a letter penned by one Strahd von Zarovich who called himself “dread lord and master”.    \n3. 3) The stranger outside had demonstrated power, what with him turning into a swarm of bats and all. \n\n\nPutting these three things together, the Cleric guessed that the stranger was this Strahd person. When the bartender came back with their food, the Gladiator cheerily asked him if he was familiar with a Mr. Strahd von Zarovich, and said that the party had made his acquaintance the night before. The bartender froze and the color drained from his face. He made a sign to ward off evil and then hurried back to the bar, muttering about he “don’t have no truck with evil and the like”.\n\nAt the mention of Strahd’s name, a man in the corner perked up. After the bartender left the party, he walked over to the party and introduced himself as Ismark. He was the son of the town’s mayor and needed the party’s help to get his sister to safety. He had been in the town of Vallaki securing a house for her that he hoped would keep her safe from Strahd and his minions of the night. Upon questioning, he was also able to answer several questions for the party.\n\n\n1. - Barovia is the name of the town they’re in and of the region.    \n2. - Strahd is a vampire. He’s been here for as long as anyone can remember.     \n3. - Ismark is unfamiliar with the city of Waterdeep and all other locations the party knows. Ismark knows that there’s *something* outside of Barovia because sometimes people come from there, but no Barovian has ever been able to leave.    \n4. - Those who attempt to leave through the mist that surrounds Barovia the region end up dead.    \n5. - Strahd has been obsessed with Ismark’s adopted sister, Ireena, for quite a while now. He had bitten her twice and the townspeople are afraid of her.\n\nIsmark and the party traveled to the mayor’s mansion to retrieve Ireena. Ismark wanted to take her to Vallaki asap. The sooner she’s away from Strahd, the better. As they approached the mansion, they saw that it had recently been under attack. The gates had been torn from their hinges, claw marks covered the walls and doors, and it looked like someone had tried to set fire to the stones of the mansion. Ismark unlocked the door the party rushed in, worried that Ireena might be in danger. Thankfully she was safe, but the stress of the attacks had been too much for the mayor. Three nights ago he suffered a heart attack and passed away. Ismark was devastated by this, but it only strengthened his resolve to protect Ireena. He would not let her die or be taken by Strahd. She was willing to leave, but insisted that they first bury their father. \n\nSo the party, Ireena, and Ismark took the deceased mayor to the church to bury him. They met the local priest and discovered that he was keeping his vampiric son locked up in the basement. They weren’t really cool with this, but the priest kept crying and insisting that the gods would save his son, so they were just like “Meh, whatever.” They got the dead dad burried and returned to the mansion to pack their bags and prepare for the trip to Vallaki.\n\nIt’s a bit of a bummer they weren’t doing this at night. They missed out on a couple of events I had planned for them, but I can always save those for later. If they manage to arrive in Vallaki, they should be there longer and I can have them do the events there. There was some good roleplaying and next week, depending on what they do, there may be a bit of action. \n",

        "text": "They had been here for most of their lives, at least the oldest ones. Some were more recent additions, some were very new as well. It was a normal thing in the Oubliette. The Dark Elves of the Fiery Sluice were not known to be merciful masters. In fact, being condemned into the pit for life, with barely enough to eat, was seen by some as a kind of mercy. Others had seen the silence and peace of death a better option. Sometimes there were fights, when people went a bit mad of hunger, and cannibalism was seen as a solid option. These individuals usually didn't survive for long ... and most of the times it would be their meat that would be eaten. This was becoming a thing that started happening more and more though, as food was no longer forthcoming. After a week or two, some of the outcasts of the Oubliette dared to climb up to see what was going on. They found the place abandoned. No guards, and dust without footprints. They had been abandoned completely. They were ... free!\n\nThey all climbed out of the pit and stood on their little island surrounded by magma. Where should they go from here? Most of them were stretching and walking around. Some tried running. It had been so long. Then one of them noticed something. It was a magma submarine, used to navigate the magma shutes of the underground realms. Their inventor was amongst them as well, having been locked up due to political intrigue. He saw his chance as they were there, and told the people he could lead them out. He knew how to control this craft and would save them all, if they all just swore fealty to him, Commodore Heliothrope. Begrudgingly, seeing no other option, the others did so, while some did not, preffering principle above practicality, and were left behind.\n\nThey found the Crystal Palace, a gleaming, towering gothic construction made out of colourful minerals, and found it abandoned! They installed themselved there and the Commodore claimed the best rooms for himself. Behind his back though, the people got disgruntled and were conniving against him. It was not long before one of them had worked herself in the good graces of the Commodore an learned how to pilot the craft, after which Commodore Heliothrope quickly found himself without use to the group and stabbed in multiple places before being let to bleed out in the cellars of the Crystal Palace.\n\nThe others formed an Alliance of Free Traders, who would work from the Crystal Palace. They converted the Oubliette to a big vault for the treasures they looted from the Palace, and which they would use to make a fortune as **Free Traders of the Underdark**.\n\n**Meanwhile**, not very far from where they were, a strange and robed creature took it's residence in an abandoned mine. Strange chanting could be heard from time to time, and the flickering light of candles pierced the darkness.\n\n**On the surface** a strange creature has made a nest, forming a mound which formed a new hill, and **somewhere else**, in another mine, yipping noises and strange, cheerful songs could be heard from strange, small, scaly creatures.\n\nYes there was life to be traded with. Opportunities would present themselves, but would the Free Traders of the Underdark succeed in their plans, or would the other creatures just as easily kill them to take their stuff?\n\nAll this and more, in the next episode of ... **The Free Traders of the Underdark!**",

        "text": "Well if it isn't my old friends, /r/gametales.  Looks like you're back for more.  And let me say, this was another fun session.\n\nThis session included Gene, Stan, Norm and Borin.  Sounds like we won't be seeing Ordin at least until 2018, and Wanda was busy with life, this session.\n\nNot much to preface.  So let's get to it.\n\n-----\n\nDear Diary,\n\nIt's hard to believe we've been gone from our home for over a year now.  So much has happened, and so much strangeness to behold.\n\nHaving finished our work for King Jefferey of the Rustle Forest, and been knighted for our service, we decided to return to our bunkhouse, and selected town site.  To check on Norm and Ordin, as well, to sort our supply situation out, as we figured out next move.  By now, we'd been on the road for months, and accomplished more than half the job we'd been hired by the \"king\" for.  Wanda decided she needed some time with Darryl, and would rather stay behind.  Norm was eager to stretch his legs and get back to finding more interesting ingredients for his cooking mishaps.\n\nHaving gone north before, we had our smaller village markers at the mouth of the river, opposite of our town, on the lake.  We also had the one further up that river, near what must have been iron deposits.  So for now, we only needed to place two more, to complete our work.  Gene had suggested something on the plains between our town marker, and home.  Stan wanted to travel north east of our town, exploring the hills in the distance.  The trip was not terribly eventful, except part way through, we noticed some of our rations missing from the carts.  And I found a large R carved into the empty bag.  So we could only assume this was the mark of Raccoon Hood, that King Jefferey told us about.  Thankfully we had prepared for long travel, and the possibility of scarce amounts of food, so with our hunting and fishing, we weren't going to feel such a small loss.\n\nWhen we got into the hills, we found a fairly suitable plateau that could have served as a village.  If we could find some water.  So what better way to find water, than picking up a stick and dowsing for it.  Which I did.  I found water, but not quite with the stick.  I slid down a slight embankment and fell into knee-deep water, after slipping in mud.  And so, we set up another marker.  And we saw the river went off in two directions.  West and further to the north east.  We went the northern way first, hoping to find something else that could serve as another village.  We did.  I don't remember anything overly remarkable about it other than a river crossing.  Probably some more trees, maybe something else.  But we turned around after placing that last marker.  And followed the river back, to see just where it ended up going.\n\nTurns out it lead back toward the third marker we'd placed on our journey.  The one near what we assumed was an iron source.  And strangely enough, we saw tents.  Blue tents on one side, and red on another.  And as we got closer, little people.  Or as Gene called them \"little things\".  He refused to speak with them.  Though Norm seemed capable of talking to the red ones.  Turns out the two sides worshipped different creatures.  The blue worshiping Bertram, a blue dragon.  It made some sense, they seemed to be some sort of midget lizard people, and they were from the blue mountains.  Then there was the others, who worshipped Gregory, a griffon.  Turns out their gods fought, and they fought in their name.  Or rather, peacefully played hockey on the \"peace bridge\" three days a week.\n\nThis was all we could get from them, really.  As Norm was translating, and he could only talk to the red painted midgets.  Then we heard wild screeching and saw two flying creatures above.  We decided to follow, and see what it would be.  It turned out to be the Griffon and the Dragon, and they were friends.  And supposedly tired of their followers.  Gene leapt at the chance to wipe both of the species out.  I managed to convince them that if we were to do this, I would get a ride on one of them.\n\nWhen we went back to the two peoples, we tried to negotiate them into a full week of battle, but they did not wish to fight, even with our tokens of proof, that we met their gods.  So we figured it was no longer our problem, and best solved by whatever settlers end up going that way, one day.\n\nWe packed our things, and returned southward, again, the trip being uneventful until we were another day's walk from the bunkhouse.  We saw a great flash of lightning.  But it was too far to make it before night fell, so we set up camp on the shore of the lake and fished.  The others caught fish.  I caught a raccoon.  We killed it, and ate well.  When we got back to the town site, there was some scorch marks and likely some small damage from the lightning, but nothing we would be unable to handle.\n\nNot long after we arrived, a caravan also showed up!  It was the first time we saw people other than ourselves!  It was rather strange.  But welcome.  They did not stay, though.  Instead, they left us a bunch of building supplies and equipment.  They didn't wish to stay, and headed north, likely to the next marker.  So with the supplies, and no real direction at this point, we decided to name our town.  Mannesota. We took our time, all of us.  Building up an tavern and inn building.  A sawmill.  Dock and warehouse.  Blacksmith.  Watchtower.  Sawmill and farm.  Even a butcher.  Gene took to some gardening through it, so that we could grow many more of those large vegetables we had found, and King Jefferey even visited several times over the course of months, bringing food, and giving us his blessing to chop down trees to continue our expansion.  We offered to plant more, to appease, before he could ask.\n\nThrough months and months of hard work, eventually the first settlers arrived to Mannesota.  And they aided us.  Eventually setting into life themselves, and expanding beyond our initial plans, sorting themselves into the various jobs that were now available.  And it was those villagers, one who worked in our watchtower that moved us toward our next... task I suppose it would be.  He saw two small people approaching on the recently started road toward the north.  I believe some of the settlers actually worked on the southern road that lead from town back to home, and decided to stay here, and continue their work between all the towns.\n\nBut I digress.  The two who arrived were emissaries from North-Northshire.  They told us a disturbing tale.  The people had been settled up there, and trading with the what we now learned were the kobolds and the goblins of the area.  They were trading goods they had with both peoples to get them to mine for them, and it was a rather amenable situation, from the sound of it.  They also taught them the proper tongue.  Which was good, as my interpretive dance did not help that much, on our last encounter.  In any event, turns out that Bertram and Gregory weren't happy about our people moving in and setting up, that way.  Apparently they terrorized and destroyed the town.\n\nAs we prepared ourselves to travel once again, the townsfolk even aided, packing up roughly two months of food for us, having used many of the vegetables, raccoon meats and various other foods of the area for us.  And at some point, the Sheriff of Rustle Forest.  Another fox, had snuck in and decided to join us, at the behest of the King.  We would not say no to he who knighted us and his requests, so we gladly had him join us, along with the two ambassadors.  We took the wagon trail north, toward Laketown.  It was much easier going than the year previous, when we were forging the paths ourselves.  The animals and wagons found easy going, and we reached Laketown in no time.  It was similar with our trek from Laketown up toward North-Northshire.  And we saw what they meant.  It was in ruins.\n\nWe took a few moments to check the area, and asked where the mines, and people were.  It turns out those who survived had made their way either to Laketown, or east, to Kneedeep.  The mines were not far, but at this moment, useless to us.  So we set about cleaning up the town, and preparing to set fires.  Gene expertly set up his traps, hoping to snag the giant beasts in them, and perhaps make our job easier.  Once we felt confident with preparations, fires were lit, and we hid in the treeline with the Sheriff.  It didn't take long before we heard the sounds.  The dragon dropped into one of the larger buildings away from us, and from the sound, was caught in two of Gene's traps.  But the griffon swooped in and nearly knocked Stan from Hidalgo.  It landed in the centre of the small village and the fight was on.  Norm and I played it careful, trying to flank the giant beasts, while Stan charged in.  Gene and the Sheriff seemed to stay back, Gene favouring his javelins.\n\nIt took some doing, and all of us walked away with some terrible wounds.  Except perhaps Norm.  But we managed to kill a dragon, and a griffon.  Needless to say, we butchered their bodies for easier storage, to take every piece with us.  It's probably that we'll have good use for all their parts, and who knows what kind of trade we could manage.\n\nWith the help of the goblins and kobolds, we spent some time licking our wounds, and preparing for our next move.  It was almost unanimous that we needed to find the dragon and the griffon's lairs.  I expect we'll be doing so any day now.\n\nYours, Majesty Borin Gly Hugh Mann III, Esquire.",

        "text": "I've recently started running my own homebrew campaign remotely over discord and tabletop simulator with a long time group of IRL players.  As a first time DM, I have a plot I'm roughly trying to follow, but I also want to give my players plenty of agency to take a bit of the pressure for world building off myself.  So for all instances in which the players take the lead, my motto has been to just roll with their antics and see what happens.  Obviously I'm going to put realistic limits on the world, but generally I want them to succeed in their personal goals.\n\nOver the past three sessions, one of our LE human paladins (named Hans Zimmer) has been taking his personal quest for power quite seriously.  This is the story of how Hans managed to conquer the small, peaceful hamlet of Pinkerton without shedding a drop of blood.\n\nOur story begins in the wake of a minor skirmish with some goblin marauders.  Hans, along with his companions, saved the town of Pinkerton from almost certain pillaging, and a celebratory day-long feast was held in their honor.  The mayor got a bit too drunk too early and passed out in a barn, so Hans decided to steal his house keys and turn the mayoral manor into a college party house.  Later that evening, a still-drunken mayor awoke from his stupor and began frantically searching for his keys.  He was making quite a scene and scarring the children, so the local blacksmith asked Hans to help him take the mayor someplace private where he could rest.\n\nHans and the blacksmith told the mayor that they would help him look for his keys, then lead him to an abandoned farm house on the edge of town and set him up with some hay to sleep on.  Satisfied that the mayor would cause no more trouble, they returned to the party in town.  However, a few hours later, Hans returned to the farm house alone with a barrel of wine.  The mayor was more than willing to continue overindulging at Hans' behest, and eventually passed out once more.  It was at this point that Hans **EDIT** ~~strangled~~ suffocated the mayor to death and staged an asphyxiation on vomit.\n\nThe next morning, Hans and company left town, pursuing the overarching quest (which is not important to this story).  Hans brought the mayor's keys with him, boasting to his companions that by right of property he could now claim to be mayor of Pinkerton.  At their next stop, which conveniently happened to be Hans' hometown, he would send a mayor of his choosing back to Pinkerton to administer in his stead.\n\nThe party arrived in Boomtown three days later, and Hans immediately returned to his family homestead, bringing with him two prisoners.  On the road to Boomtown, the party was ambushed by bandits, which were easily routed.  Hans captured two of the survivors and marched them back to his family's manor to receive justice.  Following a sick ritual dubbed \"Wheel of Death\", in which the prisoners were forced to spin for their own fate, it was determined that their demise was to be brought about by magical means.\n\nAnd so Hans set forth into the city in search of a dastardly wizard willing to perform dastardly deeds.  He struck out for the local whore house, June's Poon Saloon, where he was able to sweet-talk the madame into asking one of her customers.  What the madame turned up was a stocky, bald wizard sporting a unibrow the size of a cucumber.  He introduced himself as Pontus Euxinus, a man who loved killin' shit.\n\nHans bought Pontus a drink and convinced him to come back to his family manor where the prisoners were held.  Together, they lead the prisoners to the top of the 60-foot walls surrounding the city.  Here, Pontus levitated both prisoners hundreds of feet into the air, then sent them plunging back to earth headfirst.  Both prisoners were liquified on impact.\n\nAs the pair celebrated the execution over more drinks, Hans asked Pontus if he would be willing to administer the town of Pinkerton.  Pontus objected initially on the basis that Pinkerton lacked the abundance of cheap whores and crack cocaine he enjoyed so readily in Boomtown.  In response, Hans offered to send several cheap whores to Pinkerton as his escorts, and suggested that Pontus should use his connects in Boomtown to spread the crack game to the surrounding countryside.  All Hans asked in return was 10% of the profits.\n\nPontus readily agreed, and that is the story of how one of my players became a crack dealing kingpin of a small farming community via a bald, whoring wizard and my refusal to say no to anything.",

        "text": "When practically every single one of the 100 million plus members who play all unanimously agree that you're the best to have ever played the game, it's pretty telling how good you are. Faker is a Korean player who has been considered the best in the world for several years running, earning the nickname \"The Unkillable Demon King\". His massive champion pool, unmatched mechanics, and overall team presence have earned him the reputation he has. But even gods have beginnings, and this is the story of Faker's, and what many people consider to be the greatest play in League history.\n\nFor those who don't play LoL, to understand the video, you need to understand Zed. Every champion played has different abilities; 3 basic ones, across the QWE buttons, an ultimate, R, and a passive ability. Zed works thusly:\n   \nPassive: when striking with a basic attack, enemies under 50% health take bonus damage equal to a % of their maximum health  \nQ: throws a huge shuriken in a straight line that does damage  \nW: throws out a shadow of yourself. If you use a Q or E ability, the shadow mimics it. If you use W again, you will swap places with the shadow.  \nE: slash your blades around you, dealing damage in a small circle.        \nR: jump to an enemy, throwing a shadow behind them, and marking them for several seconds. When the mark expires, damage is dealt equal to your damage level *and* a portion of the damage you dealt while the mark was active. Activating R again will make you swap places with your ultimate shadow.\n\nEvery champion also has 2 Summoner Spells. The most used is Flash, which allows to to instantly jump a small distance away.\n\nNow in this game, it happened to be a blind pick, meaning you don't get to see who your opponent chooses, and as such, Faker and his opposing laner Ryu both picked Zed. Faker is on the red team, Ryu is blue team. At the time of the match, Faker was still relatively new to the pro scene. He'd made waves with a play several months ago, but despite that *and* being the number 1 ranked played on the korean server, he still hadn't achieved the acclaim he would. Then this play happens. As the game is approaching its end, [Faker is attacking the enemy's mid lane tower, when Ryu comes up to defend it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8vGaC4OZIs). Ryu throws out a shadow with W, and uses E, then swaps to the shadow and starts hitting Faker with basic attacks. He also uses his item active, which leeches movement speed from your enemy. Faker then takes a hit from the tower. At this point, he \"may be in trouble here\". \n\nNah.\n\nFaker uses his ultimate ability, vanishing for a split second before reappearing and instantly using his E to deal a small bit of damage, before Ryu counters with his own ultimate. The instant Ryu reappears, Faker swaps to his shadow, avoiding Ryu's attempt to hit him with a basic attack. He then uses his own item ability, which cleanses yourself of anything affecting you; Ryu's ultimate is no longer on Faker. Faker runs forward, using his Q ability so that both him and his shadow hit Ryu with the blades, then he hits him with a basic attack, before instantly using his Flash summoner spell to avoid Ryu's Q blades and any chance of a basic attack. When Faker's Death Mark pops, Ryu is nearly dead and he knows it, so in desperation he uses Flash to close the distance and finish Faker off. But Faker throws his W behind them, swaps to the shadow instantly, and uses E again to finish off Ryu, giving birth to his own legend.",

        "text": "Last time on Shark Island: the party got their asses shipwrecked, drunk, and took a job from the island's pirate lord.\n\nAs one might expect, the pirate lord keeps his manor pretty close to the harbor. It's along here that they happen upon a very familiar sight: a battered and bruised Captain Baxter in a cage on the docks, guarded by two pirates. Having been their steward for weeks, he recognises them immediately and hurries them over. The Ocean's Whisper, it turns out, was not sunk. The pirates captured it, and him, instead, as well as some of their more valuable passengers. Amongst the passengers were a Lord Scotham and Lady Jennifer Hardcastle, minor nobles heading back to their estate in Magnimar after a long voyage. The Lord is being held for ransom by Avimar; the Lady escaped in another lifeboat and her whereabouts is unknown.\n\nThe plan is made: work with the pirates long enough to learn the Lord's whereabouts and mount a rescue. Then, they can retake the Whisper and get the fuck out of pirate dodge. Captain Baxter assures them that he can manage here, but they should take along the other person in the cage - a dwarf by the name of Dupi.\n\n* Dupi, a Dwarven Fighter. Very easygoing and friendly, he's happy to go along with the party if it means his freedom. He has gotten into this cage through a series of mistakes. At some other port, he had inadvertently angered someone and been chased by an angry mob. In his escape, he jumped on the first ship he could find and stowed away. This ship was attacked by pirates; in the fracas, he somehow stowed away on the pirate ship instead, and was summarily found and captured. Thus, the cage.\n\nDupi is more concerned about getting his greataxe and 14 gold back. He knows the gold is his because he wrote 'Dupi' on each piece. His greataxe is also named Dupi. Dupi also calls himself 'Dupi the Second' because, he reasons, there must have been someone else called Dupi before him.\n\nSo, bolstered by Dupi, the party sets off along the western coast of the island towards where this merfolk pod might be. It's not long before they find a large, green form face-down on the sand, currently getting gnawed on by hyenas. It's unmistakable. It's another one of their fellow passengers!\n\n* Svald Deepsinger, aka 'Svald the Skald'. A Half-Orc Skald, his reason for travelling is the usual bardic one. He wishes to write a great epic of adventure and derring-do...about himself. Though he prefers a bow, he also fights with a truly terrible double-ended axe. Like that thing the Star Trek dudes use. You know the one I'm talking about.\n\nThe coyotes are summarily dispatched. Svald, thankful to not be being eaten, joins his fellow passengers once he's been caught up. Along the way are some strange, ancient ruins. Only a few chunks of walls really remain, as well as some half-crumbled basements within which long-gone pirates have secreted their treasure. They fill their pockets and continue on (Simza somehow nearly dying to a single giant spider on the way) and eventually find a river leading into a cavern.\n\nIt's a good thing that Simza was around before. Deeper along the river passage inside the cavern are two merfolk gripping crossbows and tridents. They cannot help but recognise the party, having just met them the night before. Thanks to their earlier mercy and some short explanations, they're allowed deeper into the cavern to speak to their leaders.\n\n(Marina thought it best to *remove* her pirate accessories before doing this. Good job, Marina. You're learning.)\n\nInside, the party is led to an underground lake, within which about 30 or 40 merfolk are hiding away. At the head, perched on a rock Ariel-style, are a brother and sister mer-pair: Liria and Namor, the leaders of this pod. These are, without a doubt, the merfolk that Avimar sent the party to slaughter.\n\nLiria and Namor offer an alternative. They are not the aquatic terrors of this island; the vicious sahagin are. It's those horrid fishbeasts that are keeping the merfolk trapped inside this lake, unable to leave for fear of being murderised like so much chum. Plenty has washed up in this lake; if the party were to instead go and destroy the sahagin, they would have full access to everything the merfolk have gathered.\n\nThe party reason that it's much better to get paid twice than once and agree. They settle down to rest in the merfolk's cove and recover before tackling the sahagin camp.\n\nNext up: killing the fuck out of some fish!\n\n",

        "text": "Oh hello, I didn't see you there.  Here we are again, you reading my awful formatting, but hopefully semi-enjoyable adventures of the Mann Family as they travel across Lunaria, in pursuit of... well, supposedly a job, but it certainly has fallen by the wayside, it seems.\n\nIn this adventure, Norm and Ordin were gone.  But Gene and Wanda make a return.  Sadly, for the next few sessions, Ordin will still be missing, as we've had to reschedule things some, and it leaves us having a few coming and going.\n\nIn any event, let's jump to it!\n\n---------\n\nDear Diary,\n\nWe keep so busy these days, it's rather strange.  Life was much simpler back at our home.  We certainly had a lot more food variety, and less raccoon.  Thankfully, Gene and Wanda seemed to come out of their mushroom-induced stupor.  I worry I cannot say the same about Ordin.  But he's seemed to be rather delicate, compared to the others.  I wonder also if Norm's obsessive soup making caused him to meet a fate similar to Ordin, as he seemed to have spent more time in strange, fevered dreams than being of use.\n\nWe took Gene and Wanda with us to show them what we had built in their sickness.  We showed them the bunkhouse, and told them the tale of how Stan and I came to have limbs of wood.  Gene was as skeptical as expected.  Even in the face of seeing the truth.  Wanda was slightly more willing to accept, but could make no heads or tails of what had happened to us.  Stan took to listening to all her stories more closely.  I do not believe Wanda communicates to Darryl, nor do I think she really can do magic as she tries to tell us, but certainly there is proof of something.  Flesh does not normally turn to wood, but I do not dislike the arm being so.  Not feeling pain seems a boon.\n\nWhen we returned, we started to show them around the area, and set up Norm and Ordin with some comforts in the bunkhouse.  It would be easier to not have to watch over them at every moment.  And they could fish, when they decided to stop sleeping.  The plums that we had found and ate, seemed to have vanished, when we had gone to look for them.  It did not make our case very well, though it appeared as if the trees had wandered off on their own, or been dragged.  It's hard to tell, especially if trees can walk.\n\nWhile looking for those trees, and we talked to Gene and Wanda about all this, we heard it.  Then saw it.  The little \"tree nymph\" that Wanda and Ordin had told us about early in our trip.  Apparently he was real, and not some imaginary creation, like Darryl.  He told us of the forest king, and said that king would not recognize Gene and my joint rule.  At least not over the forest.  We could be the kings of all things not forest.  The more we talked with him, it became obvious his king could help us, at least cure both Stan and myself.  This seemed good.  All we had to do was travel, a dangerous path and a five day walk through the woods.  We could not fit our carts, so we elected to leave those, and all the animals, save Hidalgo, with Ordin and Norm.  We gathered enough supplies for a 10 day journey each, and set off.\n\nThe trip was uneventful most of the way, until we were ambushed by a cadre of raccoons, and one large raccoon.  They were rabid, and Wanda grew ill from their bites, and she seemed to waver on the doorstep of death itself.  But we prevailed, we treated her as best as Stan could, seeing as she would not allow him to let her blood.  We continued on, Wanda laughing like a fool during the nights, oft waking us with her mad cackling.  Supposedly she claimed the dryad would tell her jokes, but she could never tell us the full joke, so I wonder if it was not simply the rabies.  On the fifth day, we reached the King of the Forest.\n\nAnd it was something that was the strangest thing yet.  A fox.  A talking fox.  And he did infact offer his help.  When asked.  He would give us a treatment for all our ailments.  Wooden limbs, and rabies alike.  The so-called quest, that he asked of us seemed simple.  Seek out four treasures, all within a day's walk from his throne.  Each one in a different direction.  And it sounded simple, perhaps even profitable for us, if there were truly treasures.\n\nSo the first path we took, lead us eventually to a bog.  Beings as none of us were dressed for bog travel, and Wanda was still ill, it fell to Stan and Hidalgo to ride out into the bog, to secure the treasure.  We could see from the shore that there was some sort of camp with things in it.  And it seemed to go easy.  Perhaps too easy, for Stan.  We waited, bickered, and spoke.  While he grabbed a bottle of what we later found out, wine.  On his return, Stan walked along side Hidalgo, which may have nearly been their undoing.  Both seemed to find poor footing and slipped into the bog.  It tried to swallow them up, and quick thinking Stan tried to hurl a grappling hook to a tree and pull himself out.  Unfortunately, he forgot the most important part of that.  Hold onto the rope.  At least he hooked the tree, somewhat.  From there, he and the horse struggled to free themselves, Stan eventually sinking deeper into the muck, and the horse making its way slowly free.  Gene and I ran into action.  I arrived first at the tree with his grappling hook, and took the free end of the rope, making a lasso to rope my struggling kin.  I managed to rope him handily, around the neck, in part.  It managed to also catch part of his arm.  With Gene's help, he and I pulled as Stan tried to wriggle free.  The goings were slow, but in the moment, something strange happened.  Hidalgo joined us on the dry land.  And near as we can tell, hurled the grappling hook at Stan, catching the lasso, and aiding us in pulling him free.\n\nIt was a sight to behold.  The muck covered Stan, rope burn on his neck, and his prize naught but a bottle of wine.  Still, we cleaned up and moved on.  Returning the bottle to the king, and making our next way onward.  We traveled on to a plateau, which Stan climbed first.  And when he reached the top, he saw naught but salt, and two bumps.  In a moment of distraction as he tried to gather salt, the bumps vanished, and he was attacked by raccoons.  They nearly knocked him off the edge several times, but he bested them, while the rest of us yelled up from below, wondering what he was doing.\n\nAgain, a return to the king, and off we went in another direction.  This third journey seemed simple.  We arrived at a cultivated garden, walled off, but with the sounds of work, or something on the other side.  We knocked, with no answer.  So Stan opened the door and entered first, ambushed by more raccoons.  Wanda hurled an alchemists fire at one, nearly catching Stan ablaze.  He was bit, badly.  And while Wanda seemed to be symptom free by now, Stan wasn't looking so great.  We dispatched the raccoons and went into the garden to find giant vegetables.  Potatoes, carrots, and so much more, seemingly all massive, and more than we thought we could carry.  So we loaded up as much as we could, hoping to keep most of it for ourselves.  Gene wanted to plant what he could later, and grow them as a future source of food for us.\n\nOur last move was to return these and head in the final direction.  Which lead us to an open field, with a lone deer.  This deer was majestic.  It was golden in fleece and golden in antlers.  We had never seen such a thing, and assumed the King of the Forest would want such a creature alive.  So Stan, suffering from whatever bites had got him, road out on Hidalgo, with another makeshift lasso.  This went rather poorly.  The deer was faster, and seemed to know what he was attempting.  Gene, Wanda and myself, having little that we could offer to aid, did naught but cheer him on.  Or rather, Gene and I had.  Wanda tries to tell it that she was preparing a spell, though by sight and smell, I think it was too much protein in her diet.  In the chase, Stan managed to rope a lone raccoon.  He dragged the poor thing for several hundred feet as fast as he could, smashing it against anything he could.  I think he found it soothing.  While he did that, it was Wanda's gas that seemed to kill the deer, when it snuck up on her.  Her gas was the end of that poor creature.  We tried to tend to it, but to no avail.  So we carried it back to the king.  Luckily, he wanted it dead anyhow.\n\nAnd now with all the \"treasures\" gathered, we finally realized what the Fox King wanted of us.  Naught but to cook his supper!  Oh certainly, he allowed us to dine with him, and others of his court.  Including the dryad that lead us there.  He explained a few things to us.  Things of Raccoon Hood, the leader of the raccoons we'd encountered, and the cause of the oaken seed plums, which turned us to wood ourselves.  After our meal, the King had his servants bring forth our reward.  Each of us was given a vile of some sap he claimed would cure everything that ailed us.  I was skeptical, considering what we'd been put through, but Stan quaffed his without a thought.  I do not blame him, it was a vile case of rabies, but it seemed to put an end to it.  And his arm and leg, seemed to return to flesh.  It was for the best, I believe.  But he slept most of the way back to the bunkhouse.  I keep my vile safely hidden away.  A wooden arm is not death, and perhaps it could be of more use, in some more grievous time.\n\nAnd Diary, I think that covers what I have not had the chance to tell you.  I'm sure there will be more to tell you, soon.\n\nYours, Majesty Borin Gly Hugh Mann the Third, Esquire.",

He has a sense of humour. \n\nAfter combat, magic items had rained down upon our party, but sadly my poor Bard had not received. Being on a tropical island, as everyone else was showing off their haul, he produced two halves of a coconut and declared, \"Behold the Coconuts of Mishakil\"\n\nThe Cleric, always an easy mark, derisively asked the Bard \"What do those do?\" \n\n\"I'm glad you asked my friend. They can do many different things, depending upon what you need. Perhaps one day I will show you of their great power.\"\n\nFast forward two months, and was we're warming up for our latest session, I nudge the Warlock's player and quietly ask \"What the hell are 'Coconuts of Mishakil?'\". He quickly reminds me, and we share a chuckle over the last session's antics. \n\nWe climb the mountain that is the setting for today's session, and my Bard faithfully clip clops his way up the stairs, remaining very cool despite the heat and exertion.\n\nAs we reach the top, the Cleric, out of breath and sweating, scowls at the Bard and demands an explanation. \n\n\"Oh it's like I said, Cleric, the Coconuts of Mishakil provide aid in an appropriate form. You seem a bit heated, would you like to borrow them?\"\n\nIn a classic 'Gimme that', the offered coconuts were swiped from the Bard's hands.  As we prepared to descend into the hot desert like environments at the top of this ancient volcano (turned out to be a Bronze dragon lair), the Cleric brings the Coconuts of Mishakil together in the first clip, shortly to be followed by the clop.\n\n#*BOOM*\n\nThe sound echoes around the volcano's crown, and the Cleric looks down at the Coconuts of Mishakil. Perplexed, but rolling with it, the Bard says \"That was the coconuts acknowledging you as their new master\"\n\nBehind the bard, the Warlock raises an amused eyebrow at the Sorcerer, having perceived the trailing edge of the somatic components for Thunderwave.\n\nNow the Cleric is the faithful holder of the mighty Coconuts of Mishakil.  \nWhat magic effects will they have on him next time? What spell will we use to impersonate them? More Presdigitation? More Thunderwaves?  \nWho knows, but itwill doubtless be hilarious.\n\n\n^^^^^It ^^^^^didn't ^^^^^happen ^^^^^exactly ^^^^^like ^^^^^that, ^^^^^but ^^^^^too ^^^^^much ^^^^^context ^^^^^ruins ^^^^^a ^^^^^good ^^^^^tale",

        "text": "After a couple of kinda-sorta attempts at GM'ing, I finally got around to organizing a group of friends for a Pathfinder game. Set on the pirate islands of the Shackles with much, much more experienced players than I, my only requirements were two: be gentle with me and don't break the game too badly.\n\nThey're good kids. They didn't. To avoid the tiresome old 'meeting in a tavern', the tale begins on a ship. The Ocean's Whisper, midway through a long voyage back to Magnimar, giving the party a chance to already know each other a little.\n\nOur crew consists of:\n\n* Lucas Fennecs, the Human Investigator. Chelish in origin but not a huge fan of the whole 'slaves and demons' thing his home nation is on, he is out travelling to do good in the world. Wears a top hat and a long leather coat all the time like a douchebag. Verbose.\n\n* Marina Mercea, the Human Magus. Varisian and very badly wants to be a pirate queen. Fully committed to the aesthetic: hat, eyepatch, the works. Was a cabin girl on a pirate vessel, which wrecked, and was rescued when the Whisper passed by. Has a possessed ghost hand.\n\n* Simza Manchu, the Human Sorceror. Varisian also. Prefers ice magic and specifically noted her high Charisma score as translating to being really, really, ridiculously good-looking. Is pretty much journeying just to get away from her uber-bitch of a grandma who taught her magic.\n\nThere are others, but they couldn't make it for the first session. The Ocean's Whisper is making good time, but our captain (Captain Baxter, a friendly old salt with many years of seafaring under his belt) advises us that we're going to have to cut close to the Shackles, a collection of islands where pirates make their home. We lost a lot of time down south so he'll try to make it up by not circling as far around as usual.\n\nYou know where this is going. As the fog descends at night, pirates descend upon the ship and blow it to fuck with cannon fire. Captain Baxter commits himself well in battle, skewering a few pirates, but knows when the battle is lost. His priority are his passengers. He bundles the party into a lifeboat and goes down with the ship.\n\nThe party floats for awhile, Lucas rowing towards the closest glimpse of land while Marina and Simza bicker. Not even this goes well: they're stumbled upon by two merfolk on the way, accompanied by a dolphin. The merfolk seem hesitant at first, not leaping to violence...at least, not until they see Marina. Then a scream of \"Pirate!!\" and a thrust of a trident pretty much gives the game away. Fortunately, Simza's judicious use of Sleep puts the merfolk down and allows them to escape without incident. \n\nThey land on the north shore of an island and make their way through the jungles. There are some weird rabid monkeys. Gross. Eventually, they stumble upon some farmland which suggests a town. The further south they go, the more populated the area gets, until they find themselves in town proper: the dirty, dangerous pirate port of Ollo. Shark Island, baby! It's a garbage fire.\n\nBut it's a garbage fire with one nice detail: an entire three-block area near the harbour that's pretty much all an open-air tavern party 24/7. Having been shipwrecked, attacked and stranded, what else is there to do but get blasted out of your fucking mind-brain?\n\nSo they do. Fortunately, Lucas' many talents lend themselves to hangover cures as well. Dragging the two magicals behind him, they make for the mayor's residence - or, more accurately, the pirate lord who rules over the town. Avimar Sorrinash and his first mate Hookwale (a grizzled little halfling pirate coated in scars) meet them and offer them a job: to go north and 'slay the enemies of the island'.\n\nThis is vague, and Marina doesn't hesitate to say so. They manage to stop just short of raising the pirate lord's ire and are informed that this means the merfolk who attack the pirates working out of this port. (The facts check out.)\n\nWith a quest in tow and a moderately okay night's sleep, there's not much to do but head to the northeast end of Shark Island where these merfolk allegedly gather. \n\nThus the first session ends. When on pirate island, do as the pirates do, right?",

They've come to terms with their fate in their own ways.  \n\nAlex the Lich Monk died while fulfilling one of the contracts, and unbeknownst to him the adventurer's guild eliminated his phylactery in order to collect on their contract.\nBob the Bolt Ace became a little unhinged by the seeming hopelessness of his situation, taking the opportunity to secretly become a follower of the Evil Goddess of Gluttony and Undeath\nCharles the ex-Cleric stocks up on wands to recover some small part of his combat utility while constantly trying to think of a way to both atone for and adhere to his Diabolic contract.\n\nThe party investigates the Adventurer's guild, finding strangely helpful Devils running the place but seemingly happy to answer any and every question they ask.  They have no privacy at any time, however; the guild maintains a room full of Imps scrying on their contractors at all times.  \n\nThe other Adventurers are much less helpful, all seemingly resigned to a life doing evil for whatever reason they signed up for - some to protect and care for their families, some because \"hey, it's a job\", etc.  They also uncover secretive \"wetworks\" missions that are available outside their contracts for more money.\n\nMeanwhile, the contracts have grown more and more questionable.  The party finally has enough when they're contracted for the first time to kill a humanoid (for much less money than they're used to - I suspect this had more to do with why they grew bored).  They sneak into the Guild after hours, eventually finding the Devil which they signed a contract with -- or so they thought.  \n\nThe Devil tells them that they can fight if they insist, but that it won't help them get out of their contract - after all, they signed the contract with the leader of the Guild, the Devil just provided the contract to make it binding.  He further suggested they go back to the scene of their first contract, if they wished to understand more.\n\nThey head back to the Giant Worm they killed, and this time investigate the scene and detect a powerful enchantment on the corpse of the worm; they begin to put the pieces together and realize the Adventurer's Guild has been setting up the dangerous situations they are then contracted to take care of.  \n\nThis extortion provides the final push they need, and they attack the owner of the Adventurer's guild at his house - the largest, fanciest palace in the city (naturally).  \n\nThanks to some traps and an unlucky summon, the fight doesn't go well for them.  \n\nFirst the monk, not realizing his lichdom has ended, dies.  Shortly after, the ex-Cleric starts bleeding out.  The Rogue spends most of the battle wiping out the summons with his Ring of Invisibility, finishing off the last of them just as the bolt ace dies, having brought the owner of the adventurer's Guild to within an inch of dying - unfortunately for them all, the rogue is too far from the owner to stop him from teleporting away on his next turn.\n\nBut before the Devil can escape, it's the Cleric's initiative. This round will be permanent death - but as he's dying he receives a surge of Divine power, the Goddess of Redemption accepting his atonement and sacrifice in exchange for one final attack on the Devil-powered human standing over his friends' mangled corpses.\n\nThe surviving Rogue wisely chose not to deal with the Adventurer's guild with the new party he found next session.",

        "text": "Playing in a homebrew campaign, and one of our players decided to retire his character owing to recent developments that happened in the game; decided to help send him off by doing a writeup of the events. Since it's a homebrew world, gonna list a few things:\n\n* Lyrica: Goddess of Fertility, Travelers, and Beauty.\n\n* Randeus: God of War and Fury. Most orcs not fond of him due to his conflict with the god that created orcs.\n\n* KuQuala: God of Contracts, Hell, and Servitude. Often makes deals with mortals.\n\n* Dragonscale: One of the larger cities in the world, where my GM starts just about all of his campaigns.\n\n* Special Legion 19 (SL-19): Secret military unit devoted to fighting the undead, draws manpower from normal units (whether through volunteers or because your CO hates your guts). Kind of akin to the Night's Watch in that it's a lifelong post, but because of the high mortality rate, there are nowhere as many restrictions as a normal unit.\n\n* Khan: Commanding Officer of the unit.\n\n* Gib-Gib: A goblin \"medic\", was posted to the unit after permanently disfiguring his commanding officer in an effort to \"heal\" her.\n\n* Ft. Deathwatch: Main outpost of the unit, positioned right outside of the largest concentration of the undead.\n\n-----\n\n##**Foreword:**\n\nWhile every batch of recruits has a couple of men who make an attempt to escape from their lifelong post at Special Legion 19, few make further attempts once they’ve been inducted as formal legionnaires. This is either due to an untimely death at the hands of the undead before they can try again, or the realization that resistance is futile; for the first ~600 years of the unit’s existence, there was not a single successful attempt at desertion. This streak was eventually broken.\n\nIn the 5th Month of 1445 EK, a single recruit by the name of Zemek Temordevori managed to make his escape. Unlike his many forerunners however, he wasn’t trying to escape the dangers of the undead- instead, being disillusioned by a series of unfortunate events, he ran out into the wastes, hoping for an Endless War.\n\n##**Background:**\n\nZemek had volunteered to join SL-19 after Captain Khan paid a visit to his unit, promising an endless war. The orc, having been left unsatisfied by his first taste of combat (which had been more of a slaughter of unarmed women and children), jumped at the opportunity. He was sent to the city of Dragonscale, where he met two of his fellow recruits- a mage by the name of David, and a fighter of some kind by the name of Dent. After a brief bit of assessment in the Arena at Dragonscale, they were sent to be formally trained at Fort Deathwatch.\n\nUpon their arrival, they met their two other squadmates- a Paladin of Lyrica by the name of Augustus, and a morbidly obese ninja by the name of Bler. Once they had completed their training, they were sent on mission after mission, leaving the orc quite content. Of course, his life on base was made difficult by his fellow orcs owing to his worship of Randeus- they even attempted to assault him in his sleep (though he did eventually gain their respect, but not companionship). \n\nOther orcs aside, his routine while part of the unit largely consisted of helping around base, whether through repairing equipment, physical labor, or through other means. He also took a particular interest in the mage after an incident involving a stolen kill, even (accidentally) being the only one to attend his wedding, and went as far as recommending him for a leadership position.\n\nHowever, over time, he started to grow a bit disillusioned with the majority of his squad, largely owing to the constant petty disputes that erupted during missions- this would eventually come to a head on a new halfling recruit’s (Isen’s) first mission. \n\nPrior to their deployment, his recommendation paid off, and David was appointed their squad leader- additionally, Zemek was assigned to look after Isen. While there weren’t any major issues for the first couple of days, a particular encounter would be the straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nThe party was attacked by two groups of undead paratroopers, so David ordered the party to split to avoid being surrounded. While Zemek was able to get a couple of good hits in on a skeletal champion that had dropped down, his kill was stolen by Isen. Having been mildly upset by this, he forgot his responsibility, and went after an undead scout that was on its own. As he began to attack the scout, Dent started wailing on it- while he didn’t wish to have another kill stolen, he remembered his objective of defending the halfling. However, just as he arrived to help, Isen was sliced in half; before he could even avenge the little man, Bler stole the kill.\n\nHaving been quite upset at this point, he was about to move in to strike Bler, but then he witnessed Augustus strike David; this caused him to enter a rampage, and he repeatedly bashed the Paladin. After a bit, he was told to stop, so he started bashing his other squadmates with the flat of his sword for quite some time. When ordered to stand down by David, he took his frustrations out on the halfling’s war pony, leaving nothing but a red paste; he only stopped due to getting pumped full of horse tranquilizers. Upon their return to base, he received his punishment in chains in full view of the rest of the unit; he was stripped of rank and made to go through basic training again, would be forced to bunk with the other orcs (and would have to clean the barracks), and would have to report to Khan on a daily basis.\n\n##**The Escape:**\n\nZemek considered this course of events unacceptable. Khan had promised him an endless war, and now he was attempting to deprive the orc of his ability to fight. Thinking it over for a bit, the fighter came to a conclusion- the endless war was out in the wastes, so he needed to make his way out to the wastes. Knowing that the other orcs would eventually gang up on him again, he began to make simple preparations.\n\nWhile everybody else was out training, Zemek began to set up punji sticks beneath the floorboards of the Orcish Barracks, eventually covering the near entirety of the area in them. Getting some help from Gib-Gib the Medicker, he had the goblin “fix” the floor of the barracks, along with setting up a hidden rope beneath Zemek’s bed. Additionally, owing to the help he provided around base, he was able to cash in favors to guarantee access to two vital pieces of equipment; a set of armor called “The Last Stand”, and the “Dead Man’s Draught”, two items usually reserved for those that are condemned to die fighting. Thanking the little fellows for their help, all he had to do was wait.\n\nHis fellow orcs made their move at night; having anticipated the assault, Zemek dropped into the small crawl space beneath his bed. Before any of them realized what was going on, Zemek pulled the rope. The boards gave way beneath the brutes- as they fell, Zemek first apologized to Randeus for what he was about to do, and thanked him for his guidance. He then rang up KuQuala, who offered the orc a deal; his soul for a guarantee of escape to his eternal battlefield. He promptly accepted. \n\nQuickly grabbing all of the necessary gear, his escape into the wastes was unhindered. As the orc made his way further and further, he found that his equipment had been empowered- the god had kept his end of the deal. His current whereabouts remain unknown, and given that Khan refused to make any public appearance in the days following the orc’s escape, it’s presumed that he has no way of recovering the recruit. Some men in remote outposts allege that they can hear him at night, laughing while slaughtering waves upon waves of the undead.",

        "text": "Not so long ago, I was playing in a Call of Cthulhu game. My first character was a detective (Detective Wolfe) with an assistant named Bruce. (No other party members are specifically important to this tale).\n\n\nDetective Wolfe had a good run, managing to survive for quite some time, uncovering plots, and keeping his sanity mostly intact. Eventually, however, the party encountered a very large Deep One and Wolfe got eaten. I started playing as Bruce after that.\n\n\nBruce, it turned out, had been an undercover agent investigating the detective's ties to the mafia (1920's). He had fallen in love with Detective Wolfe and did not take his death well. Whereas before he'd been super competant and cautious, he now rushed headlong into danger. As a melee weapon specialist this was not wise.\n\n\nStill, Bruce ended up living longr than Detective Wolfe, and was still very good at his job. Together with the party he uncovered a sect of Mormons trying to summon Shub-Niggurath (henceforth called cultists for simplicity), so that they could resurrect Joseph Smith. After that the party was side tracked for several months by a resurrected mummy that was supposed to only take one session to deal with.\n\n\nWhile investigating the mummy Bruce began to learn some magic from the books/scrolls the party had found. His sanity began to nosedive, and he became even more reckless.\n\n\nIn the final battle with the mummy (who we learned in life had been a high priestess of The Black Pharoe, one of the aspects of Nyarlathotep) Bruce decided to engage directly with a magic sword he'd found. He took massive stat damage from the mummy's abilities, and casting spells had given him temporary insanity. It was at this point I retired Bruce and stepped out of the campaign (I was in two D&amp;D games and running a third at the time, I was getting burnt out).\n\n\nA couple real world months later (almost 6 in game) I was hanging out with the GM of the Cthulhu game, and he was filling me in on what'd been happening. The party had gone on a rampage against the cultists, basically burning any building connected to them to the ground. They managed to track them to the Dream Lands, and found a way to cross over (I am unclear how exactly). The cultists were very near their goal, and the party was on a mad dash to stop them.\n\n\nThis is when the GM asked me if I would return for the final session. He didn't want me to help the party, he wanted them to be betrayed.\n\n\nI jumped at the chance. Me and the GM quickly filled in the gaps of what Bruce had been up to. We decided he'd checked himself into a mental asylum, where his mental state had declined further. He'd left the asylum, infiltrated the cult, and joined them in the Dream Lands. He was going to usurp their ritual and bring Detective Wolfe back to life. \n\n\nI came to the next session with a grin on my face, the rest of the players were happy to see me, asking me what'd I be playing, why did I wait until the last session to come back, and other questions I answered evasively. We sat down and started playing.  About half an hour in the party encountered a small group of cultists in front of a portal and immediately begin opening fire. Several cultists merely evacuated through the portal. One of the two that stayed behind raised a Tommy Gun and was about to fire, when the other cultist delivered a kick to his neck, dropping him. The party was surprised, then the cultist lowered his hood to reveal Bruce.\n\n\nThe party was overjoyed to have Bruce back with them, but he urged them on. They had to make it to the cultists before they finished the ritual.\n\n\nThey arrived in a forest. A few cultists had opened a new portal, but had not yet entered. The party tried to finish them off, but one jumped through. That's when the trees started to move. Three Dark Young attacked the party. In the insuing fight Bruce followed the cultist.\n\n\nThe party quickly finished their fight, and the two uninjured members jumped through the portal to help Bruce, not knowing what was waiting on the other side.\n\n\nThey arrived and see Bruce standing calmly over the dead cultists, cleaning blood off his sword. Bruce started slowly advancing on one of the party members. (As a side note, Bruce was down to something like 7 sanity at this point).\n\n\n\"You know, I really wish Detective Wolfe was here right now.\" Bruce commented, before shoving his sword through his ally's chest.\n\n\nThis was met with disbelief by the players. They thought I was joking, until I rolled the dice.\n\n\nHis former ally fell, and was immediately scooped up by a tentacle. The other party members instantly made the decision to unload her Tommy Gun into Bruce, he too was snatched by a tentacle.\n\n\nIt was then that the only remaining party member on that side of the portal realized where she was. She was in the realm of Shun-Nigarath. She ran to the portal just as two figures were spat out in front of it. Detective Wolfe, and the original character of the guy Bruce had just murdered (who she had been hired to find).\n\n\nShe helped them to their feet and jumped through the portal. After some awesome role-playing on the other side explaining what had just happened the session ended.\n\n\nThere's eventually going to be a part two to this campaign, but that's all for now.\n\n\n",

        "text": "*Due to a third of my class being absent because of logistics of their main class going wrong I ended up with on pupil only. (I teach protestant religion in a country where only roughly 2-3% of the population is protestant, so my classes are small) The teacher of Catholic religion also only had one pupil and came over to us asking if they could play a game. Having only a bunch of six sided dice with me and a sheet of possible character art (accidentally in my jacket pocket from when I took it with me to maybe play with the family at a feast) I suggested we do a story telling game.*\n\nI quickly explained how the game worked (none of the optional rules) and how to make a character, let them pick a portrait and cut and paste it on a small sheet of paper. All this in about 5-10 minutes. Then we still had about 20 minutes left before our class was over, so we got started. Neither the two kids had ever played a pen and paper rpg, but they did amazing.\n\n**Our Player Characters:**  [I forgot the name of this character], a Jokester (4), Archer (3), Jumper (2) and Runner (1) met up with Cheese Puff*, a Cook (4), Soccer Player (3), Thief (3) were contracted by the Boss Baby to retrieve the Golden Cheese Puff* from the castle of Ying, Yang and Fox (These names were come up with by the players).\n\n**The Game:**  I started the game with them outside of the castle, not yet noticed and asked how they were gonna do this. They decided to have one of them distract the guards while the other one snuck in. Then the other guy had to come in and to help him with this Cheese Puff decided to set some traps to have the guards run into as the Character I forgot the name off ran towards the castle. \n\nI decided that since they had worked together the other one would know that traps were set. And it worked. The guards ran into the traps. I asked what kind of traps it were. The guy answered that it were pit traps. I ran with it. No need to bog down play with the question of how he dug multiple pits, unseen, in about 5 minutes of in-game time, and covered them to hide them. Magic Realism FTW.\n\nGoing further in they saw Ying and Yang playing table tennis in the guard lounge. They were on break. One was dressed all in white with a black dot on his chest, the other was dressed all in white with a black dot on his chest. They disposed of them in a way I don’t really remember. I think sleeping arrows and a soccer ball to the face.\n\nThey were then confronted by fox who was disposed of with a Frying Pan to the back of the head. (A very creative use of the Cook Cliché/Skill, which I approved off. They are 10/11 year olds.) Then they encountered the Golden Cheese Puff on it’s shrine, discovered that it was trapped (Handy to have a Thief (3) with you) and defeated the Robot-Knights guarding it with only a sprained ankle between them. \n\nThey retrieved the Golden Cheese Puff, brought it to the Boss Baby and got a promotion (an extra dice for the next game, should we ever play a new one) just in time for the bell signaling it was recess.\n\n    *Not the actual translation. There is no real translation for the typically Dutch recipe that is cheese, rolled around in breadcrumbs and deep fried.",

It had been a center of trade, innovation, and security for so many years that its sudden absence was felt even in villages as far-flung as Pernep. Freighters were forced to switch back to the much slower method of sea transport, what with the majority of airships having been destroyed in the battle. The central bank was out of bounds, stuck in the center of the ruined city and crawling with zombies and other shadow creations. Both the Grand High Commander and Captain Veil were killed during the onslaught; Flamer reincarnated Charlotta as a half-orc, but Strell's body wasn't found. No home, no leader, and no gold. The human empire that had stood proud throughout the Great War had officially been destroyed.\n\nThe Tsethem went their separate ways. The Warforged (who had been granted citizen status after the Great War, although most of them stayed on as soldiers) chose Flamer to lead them. He took them to an isolated volcano just off the northeastern corner of Tirkosu, and discovered the wreckage of a huge cargo airship conveniently located in a planestable zone. Over the course of the next year he and his fellow Warforged carved a home into the rock, with the airship serving as an entrance of sorts. Continuing with the trend of naming things in Elvish, they called their new village Karu Sampur, which translates directly as \"crashed ship\". \n\nThey used the natural heat of their home to smelt metals into various parts and pieces, sending the finished items to the gnome village of Little Orthraze. The Warforged were one of the main reasons that society didn't collapse into a chaotic scramble for resources, as their tireless work served as an example for the other races. They didn't need food, water, or even gold to survive. Yet they set themselves to work for the good of the island.\n\nTurf took change of the Dwarves, which they were actually fine about. Dwarves on Tirkosu aren't exactly racist per se, but of all the people affected by the fall of Orthraze they felt it the most. And they blamed it on the humans, whether it was their fault or not. But Turf's father was a Dao, a creature of the earth; same as the Dwarves. So they welcomed her as their protector, and followed her to a planestable spot at the southeast foot of Mt. Tirkosu. There she literally carved a village out of the mountainside by hand over the course of a few months, an impressive feat even with the aid of her elemental warpick.\n\nThe Dwarves soon moved in, and swiftly started doing what they do best: mining for ores, which they sent to the Warforged village for smelting. Turf's mum died in the shadow dragon's attack, and as Orthraze was inaccessible she was buried in a special tomb her daughter carved for her. They'd never really gotten along well, what with Turf being quite tomboyish and her mum being, for want of a better word, a fuddyduddy. But she was still family, and her death hit Turf hard. Especially as her brother, Claye Bridgewater, also died in the assault. Or at least it was assumed that he died; The only piece of him they found was his hand. \n\nThe gnomes that had previously lived in Orthraze kind of already had a place to go, because the city's sister town was already predominately populated by their kin. Lundal went along with the refugees to Little Orthraze, and ~~worked diligently to ensure the prosperity of his people~~ set up a literal underground fight club. He really wasn't ready for the mantle of leadership, but he also wasn't a fool. Instead of continuing to hog the limelight as the leader of his kind, he had the wisdom to hand off the reigns to a friend, who also happened to be the oldest gnome in the town.\n\nThe humans were an interesting case. While many of them did the sensible thing and moved to Rahm Oru, there were those who didn't take the sudden loss of modern conveniences very well. These were mostly the richer families who's gold savings were lying in the ruins of Orthraze, or merchants who's trade relied on Orthraze being a central hub. All in all about twenty percent of the population. In their desperation to regain at least a little of their wealth, they followed the recent rumors that told of a massive oil reserve in the desert wasteland to the east. They went to all the trouble of moving their belongings around the island, spending what little coin they had on the boat fare. And it was all for pretty much nothing, as the black gold was a lot less plentiful than the rumors had made out. They had no choice but to drill what little there was, and do their best to survive in the harsh environment.\n\nDella didn't go with the humans, despite now being a full one. She was still trying to figure herself out after the drastic change. She returned to Hepthurai, having felt a connection to the Aaracokra during the team's brief stay there. The airfolk welcomed her into their home, and she spent the following year training with them, worshiping the Supreme One, and healing her soul. In time, and after several demonstrations of her harmony with the elements, the Aaracokra joined the humans in calling her Tsethem of air. Indeed, so did the rest of the island, for all four of the original team.\n\n* * *\n* * *\n\nJoin us next time, when we decide to go back to official modules instead of letting the virtual DM destroy everything! On a side note, this post marks the one year anniversary of the official \"conclusion\" to the tale of the Tsethem. In reality it was more like a new beginning, but... well, you'll see in time. Until then, folks.",

        "text": "**TL;DR** The planet of Corellia is now the birthplace of a new religion named Ivanism. The followers of Ivan the One-eyed, the God of Luck, are now going throughout the galaxy spreading his message.\n\nSo to give you a brief rundown of the relevant players:\n\n**Ak'riss:** Dashade Hired Gun (Enforcer/Maurader)\n\n**Meepo:** Gank Bounty Hunter (Assassin/Martial Artist)\n\nTo give you some context Ak'riss coerced some pirates into becoming his \"employees\" earlier in the campaign. He chose to pick one of Omega 5 to become the leader of the group and named him Bos Rule. Now Ak'riss was wanting to make Bos better at his long-range fighting ability so while on Corellia he searched for a sniping instructor to teach his second in command how to better handle the Model 77 Air Rifle he recently acquired.\n\nWhile searching through the streets of Coronet City, Ak'riss, Meepo, and Bos reach an odd looking storefront nestled between two buildings (Ak'riss' player rolled two successes but also three threat on a streetwise check). Above the barely attached door, it had a crudely painted sign that read, \"Ivan's Hunting Instruction.\" Pushing open the door to the sound of a tiny bell, a very excited looking human man with one eye socket completely open greeted them with a large smile. Quickly rattling off that his best rate is 200 credits with some twitches like he is maybe on something.\n\nAgainst Bos Rule's objections, Ak'riss agrees to the rate just to see what will happen. Ivan took Bos into a back room and after a little while, some steady shots occur with one final shot after about 30 minutes. Bos Rule emerges from the door with a look of confusion and irritation but no Ivan emerges. Ak'riss and Meepo go into the \"back room\" which is really just the alley behind the built-up storefront converted into a makeshift range. Lying in the center of the alleyway with a sniper rifle in front of him is Ivan with a blaster bolt through the front of his face. It seems like whatever was being used as a backstop for the range reflected the blaster shot back into Ivan. Ak'riss and Meepo started to leave but decided that he deserved a proper burial. Not able to find dirt within the cityscape they tossed his body in a dumpster within the alley and gave him a Viking burial.\n\nSomething moved within both Ak'riss and Meepo where they wanted to respect Ivan more. Over a couple of sessions, the two developed a kind of makeshift religion developing the Code of Ivan and converting his alley storefront into an actual storefront complete with a mural of Ivan holding a sniper rifle with a slight glow around him. Here is a preview of the Code of Ivan:\n\n* Ivan is all about self-sacrifice and not wasting anything.\n\n* Anyone with an open eye socket will be killed for blasphemy.\n\n* Murder is okay, Ivan killed Ivan.\n\n* Ivan shot himself for our sins.\n\n* Ivan believes actions speak louder than words.\n\n* Every 100 days a pilgrimage must be made to Ivan's gun store to pray.\n\n* An \"Ivan\" is 100 of something.\n\n* Heaven is a sniper tower in the middle of a spice field with prancing spice deer. (I have no idea, I am copying directly from their list.)\n\n* Ivan's skull is the holiest of relics.\n\n* It has been decreed that the symbol of Ivan shall be a circle with a triangle inside of it (The despair symbol, because why not).\n\nSo far they have eleven total followers:\n\n* Ak'riss\n\n* Meepo\n\n* Aedin (Another player, he said if Ak'riss' player rolled a triumph on his next check he would convert)\n\n* A police chief who was drunk in a cantina\n\n* A smuggler captain and his surviving crew members\n\nAt this rate, it is starting to feel like a Dark Heresy campaign with a couple of hardliners and their escorts. But hey, the players are having a good time so I am having a good time running the game for them.",

He missed every shot. \n\nProfessor Ashmore - A scholarly guy who never stopped reading his 4k paged book and had weird various healing knickknacks, like kicking someone in the wound but his foot is wrapped in bandages or pouring a jar of mysterious liquid on a butler that had been gored. At some point a bird flew out of his top hat. \n\nThese were all pre made characters I came up with on the spot. Props to my players for breathing so much life into them, especially on a one shot!  \n\nSo the plot is one of the premade one-sheet adventures- a little kid mourns his mother's death by clutching to a strange idol his distant father gave him. This idol summons a Crocotta, who hunts people who looks like the child's father- as the child blames his father for not being there when his mother died.\n\nThey kill the monster a few times, as it keeps coming back. They discover a child weeping and notice that he's holding a statue that looks similar to the beast they've been killing over and over. Godwin tries to steal it, but it doesn't work out and he gets himself arrested and a scandal after he assaults the child's father.\n\nStone, Godwin, and Ashmore all managed to talk up the  butler to try and convince him that the statue is stolen and they need to retrieve it but.... Carmichael decides to sneak into the child's room. He tries to wake him up so he can take the idol, as Carmichael's player puts it \"I'm not a smart man\" (d4 in smarts) \n\nThe kid wakes up and looks at him with sleepy eyes, \"Father?\"\n\nAnd Carmichael goes.... \"Yes. It's me, your real father\" and gets 3 raises on the persuasion check. And the kid believes him. \n\nThe kid is so happy to know he actually has a loving father, a loving father who fights monsters! And quickly goes along with him and even gives him the idol. Carmichael thinks about how he's going to get away with this and thinks the best solution of course, is TOO FAKE THE KID'S DEATH.\n\nHe smears blood all over the bed and creates claw marks all over the place. And then, another burst of wonderful insight attempts to summon the Crocotta. He passes the knowledge check and summons the crocotta, Carmichael thinking of his worst enemy- The waiter that brought him the wrong dish and then shanked his wife in an alleyway. The waiter who looked similar to the butler. \n\nSo the crocotta is summoned and gores the butler when the butler tries to wake the child to get the supposed stolen item. Carmichael jumps out the window and takes the kid to their lodge/hide out. \n\nThe rest of the gang managed to defeat it (By the gang, I mean Stone as Stone was the only one who rolled well for combat) and the butler is distraught to find out that his lord's child is dead as that means he's likely to lose his job. Stone roles such a high investigation on the \"murder\" scene that she immediately knows that it's staged and knows EXACTLY who did it and covers for him.\n\nSo the murders are technically solved, and they all go home to the lodge to see Carmichael drinking hot coco with his new son. A goofy conversation involving a lot of yelling, and dumping whiskey into his hot cocoa after the kid goes to sleep.\n\nIt all ends up in me dragging Carmichael's player away and saying \"He's your real kid\" and everyone losing their mind and laughing. It was such a good end to the session, and now Carmichael's player wants to play the kid as a player character in a long term campaign i'm thinking of.\n\nOverall, I'm so proud of how this session went and how fun everyone had and I desperately wanted to share it!\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7afd1y/black_crusade_dont_psychically_poke_the_ork/",
        "text": "Our tale needs a bit of backstory to make sense: The group currently consists of me, a human psyker, and a very narcissistic Chaos Space Marine Chosen, both worshipping Slaanesh. We have a ship (similar to the one from the Chains of Torment Starting-Adventure, but in working condition) and after some cruising through the Segmentum Obscurus we arrived on a planet of the Severus Dominate which has been fighting an ork invasion for multiple generations.\n\nFor people unfamilliar with it: the Severus Dominate is a faction from Only War, they rebelled against the Imperium, officially because they think that imperial officials are corrupt, inofficially because Duke Severus wanted more power. Either way, we had previously gained some information the dominate might be interested in, so having someone who can recommed us to their superiors would be good, also, establishing a chaos cult on that world would please Slaanesh. So, we decided to offer our help to the planetary governor with the intention of becoming war heroes and using that status to further our own ends.\n\nThe basic situation on the ground is as follows: Dominate and Ork forces are in a deadlock across three fronts. The orks are part of the Grimtoof \"Git-Slaver\"'s Waagh, and have 5 city-district-sized Factories in which enslaved  humans are producing weapons. The northern and southern fronts defend one factory each while the western front is held up by three factories. These factories have to be destroyed to allow the dominate forces to push through the ork frontlines. Preferably after saving the slaves inside them.\n\nWe chose the northern front as our first target because knocking the isolated factories out first will hopefully provide us with some additionall help on the larger western front. In addition to our two player characters we were accompanied by a squad of 6 Dominate guardsmen with various backgrounds, my sniper-gnoll minion (from a Slaanesh worshipping xeno-race we met earlier, I have some forged papers identifiying him as a sanctioned xeno) and a pyschic-familiar xeno hawk which can temporarily raise my psy rating and function as aerial reconaissance. Things go pretty well, we raid a smaller Ork-Grog factory, save the slaves there, capture an ork trukk and I only get set on fire once during all of that. On our way to the factory we even manage to liberate a heavily damaged Leman Russ from the orks and one of our NPCs is able to get its las-cannon back online. We attach the Leman Russ to the back of our Trukk and proceed to take out a few Ork flak towers so we can call a bombing run on the factory later on. \n\nThen we start to infiltrate the factory itself. Luckily, both, the driver's cabin and the truckbed are covered by armorplates, so nobody could see inside. Our CSM, who was driving, failed his intelligence check to understand the orkish logistics system, which turned out to be a good thing because you actually need a certain amount of stupiditiy to get an idea of what orks consider logical. Inside the factory, however, we got lost and then ended up in front of a machine the orks were dumping weapons into followed by crackling and sparks flying around. I figued out that the machine is a tellyporta and that the orks are apparently sending part of the weapons manufactured here to other planets. We were thinking about ways to use that tellyporta as a distraction to free the factory slaves when our CSM asked my character if he could psychically interfere with it. So, I psychically poke the tellyporta, which causes an explosion at another point in the room. The CSM asks: \"Can you control that?\" I fail my intelligence check and am 100% convinced that I have perfect control over where to poke the tellyporta to cause stuff to explode. The generators the tellyporta runs on are in our sight so, focusing on them I push against the warp around the tellyporta.\n\nThe warp pushes back. The veil between the Immaterium and the material world tears and it starts raining blood inside the whole factory. In fact, \"rain\" is and understatement, it's a storm. Gretchin are thrown through the air, a couple of orks fall into the tellyporta, and we gain corruption points because some slaves on the lower levels drown in the storm. Well, that didn't go as planned, and we probably have to deactivate the tellyporta to make it stop, so I decide to take a gamble and poke the tellyporta again. The result was equally explosionless but added eery voices from beyond whispering horrible thruths and secrets not meant for mortals ears to the NPCs in the back of the truck, the cruel fates of past psykers to my character, read pacifistic speeches about the futility of war to the orks, and told the CSM that his power armor is really tacky and makes him look fat. In short we all gained some additional corruption points.\n\nI note: Psychically poking the ork tellyporta seems like a bad idea.\n\nSince the governor probably wouldn't be too happy if we solve their ork problem by replacing it with a demon incursion, we decide to look for a different approach. Luckily, the factory-wide bloodstorm proved to be a quite efficient distraction. A door on a viewing platform closeby opens, a big mek and two weirdboys run out and the former proceeds to beat the later, which leads us to the assumption that those three are responsible for the tellyporta. Unfortunately, the NPCs and my minion in the back of the truck are currently lying on the floor, crying and in a state of catatonia because they aren't used to perils of the warp being unleashed. Pah, NPCs. Can't stand anything. So the CSM and me get out of the trukk, succeed on our strength saves to keep our footing in the storm (not a surprise for the CSM, but my psyker's strength is pretty low) and ascend the viewing platform.\n\nThe CSM sneaks up on the three orks and I fire off a couple of doombolts, which immediately causes another role on the perils table because the malfunctioning tellyporta made the warp quite unstable. Luckily, i just burn my soul a bit, gaining some more corruption poins and locking away my powers for an hour. The big mek has an orkish shock cannon but his shot misses. The two weirdboys suceed on their intelligence rolls and decide to engage with a staff and a shoota respectively.\n\nTo summarize the combat: The CSM liquifies the big mek with his energy sword (narrowly avoiding the shock cannon ammo exploding) and bisects a weirdboy, while my character manages to kill the other weirdboy using a las-carbine. The weirdboys missed all their attacks.\n\nWe proceed into the command center which is filled with gretchin who we kill pretty quickly. Unfortunately, all the controls in the command center are labeled in orkish, no gretchin are left and our NPC who at least speaks orkish is still back in the trukk, and not capable of forming a coherent sentence. As a consequence the CSM has to scoop up what's left of the big mek and drink it to gain some of his memories, enough to read the labels in the command center and speak some orkish. He also answers a call on the command center mainscreen of another ork asking where his weapons are. Personally, I hope the malfunctioning tellyporta dumped those weapon shipments that were still being processed on that asshole dark eldar cabal leader we met earlier. The ork that called us believed that the CSM was one of the slaves, causing the narcissistic/megalomaniac CSM to demand that the ork shows proper respect to him, which ultimately lead to the ork hanging up in rage. The CSM managed to shut down the tellyporta and cause a riot among the orks via the PA system so that we might free the slaves while they are busy. We then returned to our trukk, told our NPC squad about our success in taking out the commanding orks (which they were happy to hear... i think... they seemed to shake a bit less when I told them), evacuated the slaves who survived the bloody storm and called in a bombing run on the factory.\n\nBack in the capital we got a little parade attended by all 15 citizens who hadn't been conscripted to the frontlines or dominate ammo factories, received a couple of medals and infamy points. My character reached another corruption threshold causing him to grow a tail, which - because of his allegiance to Slaanesh - is a self-lubricating tentacle with +20 on Weapon Skill rolls and the ability to ejaculate. Luckily, I also succeeded on an acquisition roll to gain 4 cameoline cloaks - one for me, one for my minion, two others for our NPC sniper and demolition specialist (they were pretty happy about that, they might even sleep a night or two without having horrible nightmares about the malfunctioning tellyporta). Currently, we are celebrating our victory with the NPC squad at a servitor-stocked bar/brothel which is one of the most popular places for soldiers on leave from the frontline. (Which is why my character is currently cutting small slaanesh-runes into the servitors, to spread some of the joy of excess to those visiting guardsmen.)\n\nSo if you ever find yourself in the grimdark future of the 40th millenium, don't psychically poke any orkish tellyportas. Rolling a higher result on the perils of the warp table is probably unhealthy for the planet.\n\n",

        "text": "I just played the single stupidest session of an RPG I've ever had the misfortune to participate in. So, of course, the first thing I do is inflict it upon you poor souls. \n\nI've complained in /r/RPG about my current GM a couple times already. He does the bare minimum in terms of storytelling, and often leaves out vital information unless we explicitly ask for it. Nevertheless, he brags about how awesome a GM he is almost constantly. Despite his flaws, his is the only organized play game in town, and it fits my schedule, so I've been tolerating him.  \n\nTonight (November 1), we got together to play a special session: instead of our normally scheduled adventuring, we were going to play through his homebrew Halloween-themed adventure. I went all out--I prepped three separate characters, got ready to hand them out to people who showed up late, the works. See, holiday games are often a chance for the GM to cut loose and have a little fun, so I was eager to see what happened when our GM wasn't running a pre-written adventure. I was waiting for him to convince me that he really *was* the top-shelf gamer that he claimed to be. \n\nSo, we sit down, and the GM tells us he's had this adventure for four years now, and apparently has run it every Halloween. Cool, I guess?\n\nThe game begins. \n\n(All dialogue is paraphrased for effect.)\n\n&gt;GM: The spooOOooky Jones house has been cursed for 200 years because an evil witch did it. The Joneses want you to clean it out. You come up to the house, and Tom unlocks the front door--\n\n&gt;ME: Who's Tom?\n\n&gt;*GM gives dirty look.*\n\n&gt;GM: Just a sec. You meet with the Joneses in the parlor. Tom Jones is the dad, Mary Jones is the mom, and Billy Jones is the kid. Tom says, \"Please save my family.\" Then he ded. \n\n\"he ded\" was a recurring theme. I'm being purposely reductive here, as he did actually narrate the action, but it was legitimately about that dramatic: Tom, IIRC, slit his own throat, but there was no foreshadowing, no opportunity to interfere, and no chance of saving him after the fact. Just \"he ded.\"\n\nThe house has four or five rooms. Each room followed an identical formula: \n\n&gt;GM: You walk into the room. Something spooOOooky happens. There's a Jones here. They say \"Please save my family.\" Then they ded.\n\n&gt;PLAYERS: ...\n\n&gt;GM: I will now read a list of all the MacGuffins in the room. Which room would you like to proceed to next?\n\nThis went on for a half-hour.\n\nWe finally got to the Creepy Attic Room, where all the Bad Stuff was coming from. We got in and found three NPCs: one was on an altar, one who ran away, and one turned into a demon. We killed the demon almost instantly (Thank you, Paladins!). \n\n&gt;GM: Billy Jones is on the altar, unconcious.\n\n&gt;PLAYERS: Let's wake him up.\n\n&gt;GM: You can't.\n\n&gt;PLAYERS: Let's take him off the altar.\n\n&gt;GM: You can't.\n\n&gt;PLAYERS: Let's attempt to heal him.\n\n&gt;GM: You can't.\n\nThis went on for a *long* time, with us trying everything we could think of. Break the magic circle? Attempt to read the magic runes? Roll for knowledge to try and understand what's happening? \n\n&gt;GM: You can't.\n\nFinally:\n\n&gt;ME: Since that one NPC ran away, I want to go see if I can find her. \n\n&gt;GM: You're leaving the Creepy Attic room?\n\n&gt;ME: ...yeah?\n\nThe GM excitedly starts tapping the table, apparently to get his wife's attention (also playing, but sworn to silence). \n\n&gt;GM: The entire party returns to the parlor. \n\nYes, he forced *all* of us into the parlor, despite the fact that only I had said I was leaving, and that I hadn't said where I was going. \n\n&gt;GM, continuing: You are ankle deep in fluid. Mary Jones is sitting at the table with a candle, writing something. Perception checks?\n\n&gt;PLAYERS: * Roll *\n\n&gt;GM: She is writing \"Save my family.\" She drops the candle in the fluid. It is gasoline. You ded.\n\nHe immediately starts packing up his stuff. \n\nWe all just kinda sat there for a second. My BS meter was pegged.\n\n&gt;GM's WIFE: Wait, didn't that encounter happen in the basement last time? \n\n&gt;ME, internally: ...so, this isn't the *first* time he's TPK'ed everyone for no reason?\n\n&gt;ME, aloud: So, what was the solution to the dungeon? We tried everything we could think of...\n\n&gt;GM, smugly: My lips are sealed.\n\nAnd with that, the session was over. \n\nTime from beginning to Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies: 45 minutes. \n\nOn the drive home, I was reflecting to myself: GM seems like the kinda guy who would *love* the Tomb of Horrors. It's full of no-warning insta-kill traps that could decimate the entire party. \n\nOnly, the Tomb of Horrors has a *reason* behind it. It *is* solvable, if you are clever and follow the clues. And, as I recall, there are zero insta-TPKs. \n\nBut still: I think he's looking forward to the day when, once again, he can say those fateful words:\n\n&gt;GM: You ded.\n",

        "text": "Hello again, /r/gametales.  You might remember me from posts such as yesterday's semi-successful post: [Chronicles of Mann: Travel Diary of Borin Gly Hugh Mann the Third, Esquire](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/79x4gf/pathfinder_chronicles_of_mann_travel_diary_of/).  We had another session only days after the first, however, Wanda, Ordin and Gene's players could not make it.  So in the interest of ever moving forward, we made them do something stupid that put them out of commission.\n\nWithout further ado, let's run with it.\n\n----------------------\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nIt feels like it's been forever since I last wrote you.  But it was likely yesterday, or maybe the day before.  It all seems to blend together out here.\n\nTurning the page back, I know I told you about Ordin's descent into the same sorts of Tom Foolery as Wanda.  A shame, really, but I guess we should have seen something like that coming.  He really needs to rejoin the fold proper and come home, when we all get back.  I suppose they must have gone for mushrooms or something when he decided her brand of wild tales sounded fun to join in on.  Because afterwards, Gene, being the 'talented chef' decided that he should brew up some sort of mushroom broth or tea.  I believe this even happened after Wanda made that fool sign \"DO NOT EAT POISON\".  I'm not sure there's any relation.\n\nIn any event, it was some nasty smelling broth, to my refined pallette, and I refused to partake.  I believe Stan and Norm showed some class in following suit.  What happened next was rather off-putting.  I mean they were feverish, and gibbering, and unconscious.  It was all rather annoying.  Except the part where I got to be king, unopposed.  And that was to our benefit.  We accompilshed things!\n\nDiary, it was interesting.  The weather out here is so strange.  Not a cloud in the sky one day, the next snow, and days later, blizzards.  I had considered buying snow shoes, skis and even cold weather attire, but the others didn't seem to thing it made sense, and frankly, they made valid points.  Thankfully, Stan had the idea to cram all three of the ill ones into one cart, toss all their bedding atop them, and stuff their extremities down eachothers' trousers, to prevent frostbite.  An amusing affair, and hopefully, we suffer no wrath later.  Wanda doesn't take kindly to our jokes.  Even if it does save her life and limb.\n\nWe weathered the blizzards across the plains.  And at one point, dealt with wolves in deep snow.  They were trying to steal away Ordin, the poor thing.  But we dispatched them handily.  And ensured we tied the group back together.  Things went better after that.\n\nOh!  That's right, I also mentioned my arm, last time.  But that's all in good time, Diary.  I have more to cover before I reveal that strangeness.\n\nEventually, we found an idyllic spot.  It was gorgeous.  A meeting of the plains, a wooded area, perhaps one could even call it a forest, and a beautiful lake.  Norm took to fishing once we first set up.  I set about building a shelter, as Norm seemed to think a worse blizzard was on its way.  Oh sure, Diary, he turned out to be right, but I was not going to congratulate him for it.  It was awful weather!  Stan and his steed, Hidalgo, set about gathering wood for a fire, and scouring for any foragable foods.  And when all were done, we had plenty of firewood, a couple of large trout, and smaller dace, along with an arm-load of fairly average, but very fresh, plums.\n\nOur dinner that night consist of fresh fruit, delicious, fresh trout sashimi and not a bit of wandermeal to be tasted.  Glorious!  Absolutely delicious!  Fit for a king, and his underlings.  The ones who were unconscious were fed a simple broth, with egg, to keep them fed, and avoid solids.  And overall, the night went well.  And the next day, I set my task at hand to improve our temporary shelter, aiming to build a bunkhouse, so that we would still have all the materials of our tents and such, for when we were to set out.\n\nWhile I kept myself busy, Stan and Norm searched the area.  Trying to acquaint themselves with what was near.  They told me they found some weird cabin with an old axe nearby, and some flint and steel.  In the cabin, supposedly it was unnaturaly cold.  Colder than outside.  And when Stan lit a fire with the flint and steel he found, it exploded out of the fireplace, and out the chimney.  After that, Stan told me things were much warmer.  Odd, very odd.  Perhaps even odd on the level of Wanda and Ordin?\n\nOn their return, I heard the sounds of animals, and their shouts of combat.  So I dropped my tools and ran to join them.  And wouldn't you know it, it was the strangest animals we'd ever encountered.  Well, they looked like raccoons, which we clearly were masters of dispatching.  Along with wolves.  But these raccoons weren't normal.  We were chipping off ears, and splintering away what we assumed was flesh.  And as each one was destroyed, they become showers of splinters, and the sounds of splitting wood could be heard.  Very, very strange indeed.  Norm had been the cook the last few days, I hope he hadn't slipped anything into our foods, like Gene had with the others.\n\nAfter that, we returned to our bunkhouse, and set about trying to make sense of things.  Norm requested that once the bunk was complete, I should build a smoker, so that he could cure meats and other things.  He'd started becoming obsessed with making food, and broth, and all manners of things to feed us.  But he showed he has the skill.  It was nice to have the variety.\n\nWe spent almost a week, ensuring the weather looked good and would hold, before we planted the first of the flags, signaling this would be the new city settlement.  We packed out things, secured the bunkhouse and set out north-easterly, around the lake to return to the plains, seeking the river we were certain we could see from across the massive body of water.  It took some time, but when we reached it, it was rather peaceful.  We set up another  marker, for one of the smaller villages, and decided to follow the river up stream, in hopes it would offer the chance to find mineral resources.\n\nAfter several days and some hard walking, I found myself having fallen into a ravine.  And my left arm no longer worked, at all.  Between myself, Norm and Stan, we got me out, and Stan attempted to fix it.  I say attempted, Diary, but he's almost a butcher of a 'doctor'.  The bright side of this, was I, yes, all me, found proof of minerals, likely iron or some other such ore.  So we dropped another flag, and decided to turn around.  And only slightly because of the weird looking flying creature that seemed to be circling the mountain we were on.\n\nAs the travel went, on one particular night, Stan noticed the prunes that we'd made from those plums those weeks again, were turning to wood.  This seemed very, very strange.  What was more strange, was that my arm, now in full, working order, also appeared to be some sort of wood.  Stan noticed that one of his legs, and arm was similarly turning wooden.\n\nIf it hadn't happened to me, I'd think Stan was crazy.  We've since decided that we need to return to the bunkhouse outpost.  Perhaps we'll set ourselves up there for a bit and try to find an answer.  I'm not sure it's all bad, having an arm of wood.  It ought to hit a lot harder.  I hope.\n\nWell Diary, I should leave you for now, tucked safely in my watertight pack again.\n\nYours, Majesty Borin Gly Hugh Mann the Third, Esquire\n\n\n----------\n\nWow!  Right?  Sorry about the wall of words.  We actually got a LOT done in session 2.  And with session 3 coming this weekend, we'll see a return of Gene and Wanda, but Norm will be away.  Will Wanda beat us for our stupidity?  Will Darryl actually give her the power to fix us?  Can Gene make a better egg soup than Norm?\n\nTune in next time.",

        "text": "It took four tries, but the ~~Avengers~~ party has finally been assembled. And just in time, too. I really wanted everyone to be present as the intro concludes and the real story begins.\n\nThe Party:\n\nDamien, the LG Paladin - He’s back and ready for action. The party’s a lot more focused now that it has its leader again.\n\nLuvLock, the NN Warlock - His near-death experience last week seems to have driven home the lesson that he shouldn’t pick up shiny things without thinking first. He’s definitely more cautious now.\n\nMidir, the NN Gladiator - He’s becoming an enabler for the Pirate, egging him on to try stupid stunts and distracting the Paladin so the Pirate can steal things.\n\nSir Elvenbeard the Vast, the CN Pirate - Continues to try to steal everything that isn’t nailed down. If something is nailed down, he just takes the nails too. In the presence of the Paladin though, he limits himself to stealing everything the Paladin can’t see. The highlight of the evening was when he tried to steal a 6’ tall candelabra [(see example picture)](https://www.dhresource.com/0x0s/f2-albu-g5-M01-F2-05-rBVaJFhKOoCAQb-vAACD6CcXLsc751.jpg/5ft-tall-5-arm-white-gold-silver-floor-candelabra.jpg) while the Paladin’s back was turned.\n\nSir Richard Burns, the LN Cleric - Still riding high on the penta-kill he got last week. He usually stays in the back supporting the party, but he can dish out damage if needed.\n\nThe evening started with a text from the Pirate saying he would be about 45 minutes late. Normally I’d just have his character be passive until the player arrived, but tonight I had a plan. As party descended the staircase they found last episode, the faint chanting became audible. Ghostly voices repeated the same phrase over and over.\n\n&gt; He is the Ancient. He is the Land.\n\nThey emerged in a room with alcoves set into the wall at regular intervals. In the alcoves rested various ritualistic items, like shrunken skulls, daggers, bones, and such. Last week’s shadow attack was fresh on their minds, so they left the items and moved on to a portcullis set in the wall. They called for the Pirate to check it for traps, but realized he wasn’t there! They searched the room, calling out as loud as they dared, but were met only with the continued chant.\n\n&gt; He is the Ancient. He is the Land.\n\nThey attempted to open the portcullis without the Pirate, but couldn’t find a lever or switch to operate it. They investigated the portcullis itself, searched the rooms, and even rolled Arcana on the ritual items to see if there was some ritual involved in opening the portcullis. They found nothing. They were discussing travelling back upstairs to look for a way to open the portcullis when the Gladiator piped up.\n\n&gt; I know it’s pointless, but I guess I could try lifting it up…\n\nAnd what do you know, he *did* lift it up. The party passed through into a partially flooded room. At the center of the room, a dark, bloodstained altar sat atop a raised dias. And chained to the altar was none other than the Pirate. As the party’s light fell upon the Pirate, ghostly forms coalesced from the shadows around the room. As the shades appeared, the chant changed.\n\n&gt; One must die! One must die! One must die!\n\nThe Paladin rushed to the aid of the Pirate while the rest of the party faced the shades. They attacked several, but did no damage. The shades didn’t even react. As the Paladin made his way to the altar, the ghost of Gary Gygax smiled on me and the Pirate joined the game. The Pirate was very disoriented. Last he knew, they were going down some stairs and now he’s chained to an altar surrounded by chanting ghosts. With the Paladin’s help he freed himself and the party ran for the open portcullis. Just then, a horrific beast rose from a pile of bones at the far end of the room! It was a shambling mound! The party turned to face the shambling mound and due to the valiant efforts of the Cleric and Paladin (and no small amount of luck) they slew their foe. As the mound fell back into the water, the shadowy forms around the room vanished and their chanting ceased. The party had slain the monster in the basement! Unfortunately, the Paladin had been knocked unconscious and several others in the party were badly wounded. \n\nThe next order of business was to escape the house. Previously, the party had found a trap door that lead to the ground floor of the house. Rather than use this route to quickly escape, they carried the unconscious paladin up from the basement to the attic and then down to the third floor so they could have a long rest in the bed they saw there. Ok. That works. Them leaving at night actually works better for the story anyway. As they exited the room, they noticed that all of the doors had been replaced with scything blades, the once strong walls were cracked and rotting, and a foul smoke bellowed forth from the fireplaces. So they went upstairs to talk to the ghost children. Of course, to get there they had to go through two doorways filled with scything blades. Only the Pirate was able to dodge all of the blades and the rest of the party arrived in the ghosts’ room bloodied by the blades. The Fighter walked up the ghosts and told them joyfully\n\n&gt; We did it! We killed the monster in the basement!\n\n&gt; Well done. We’re glad you succeeded.\n\n&gt; You are at peace. We’ve avenged you. \n\n&gt; Sadly, no. Our spirits still may not rest\n\n&gt;But we killed the monster.\n\n&gt;The monster did not kill us.\n\n&gt;But your parents locked you in here because of the monster.\n\n&gt;And yet the monster was not what kept us here.\n\n&gt; But you asked us to kill the monster while we were outside.\n\n&gt; We had never seen you before you came to our attic.\n\n&gt; But you said-\n\nAt this point the Paladin broke in and suggested that despite what they had thought, the fact that the ghosts remained was proof that there was obviously something keeping their souls from departing. It’s not like the ghosts needed the party’s permission to pass on to the afterlife. Since the ghosts were still here, killing the shambling mound must not have worked. Instead of sitting around arguing with the ghosts, why not leave and return later to help the children. This logic worked, and the party made its way to the front door, passing through several more of the bladed doorways and nearly killing themselves in the process. Seriously, they took 147 damage due to their inability to make successful Acrobatics checks. When they were all finally outside, the Fighter and Paladin were both unconscious due to the blood loss and the Warlock was at one hp. \n\nAs they stood outside the house, the conscious party members heard clapping. They looked up and saw a man standing on the roof of the house opposite them, his tall body silhouetted by the moon. He called out to them, his voice a rich, accented baritone. \n\n&gt;Vell done, adventurers. Very vell done! You succeeded vhere others failed. \n\nHe let out a low, rolling laugh.\n\n&gt;Velcome to Barovia. Enjoy your stay.\n\nAnd with that, he exploded into a swarm of bats that flew off into the night. The conscious party members carried their unconscious friends to a tavern where they could rest and heal up for the next day’s adventures. We ended there for the evening and I gave the party a homework assignment of leveling their characters up to level 3.\n\nIn all, the Death House intro went well. The Pirate’s lateness let me create a unique scenario for them and the shambling mound and doorways o’ death sobered them up to the fact that they really could die. If I’d rolled higher or they’d rolled lower, we easily could have had 2-3 members dead. At the same time, the Cleric killing five shadows in one go proves that the party is also a force to be reckoned with. We’ll see if any of them figure out that the figure on the rooftop was the man depicted by the statue in the house. If they ask about the house, maybe the townspeople can tell them about the cult that used to live there and in doing so drop a hint or two about Strahd. Of course, it will be quite the task to shine light on the dark mysteries that shroud Barovia. Will the party be up to the task? Tune in next time to find out.\n",

        "text": "Hello /r/gametales!  Usually I just lurk, read and comment, but beings as /u/Lord_Trevarious dragged me into his new group at the dissolution of our old SW RPG group, we've begun some hijinx.\n\nYou may remember him from such tales as: Salad the Necromancer.\n\nNow then, onto the nitty gritty details.  This is my first experience with the GM, and second game with this group.\n\nThe premise was simple.  Low magic world, very little backstory given to players ahead of time, and ONLY LEVEL 1 HUMAN FIGHTERS.  Later, I found out that it was 1 caster, and 1 ranger as well.  There was one final stipulation: you must be a member of the Mann family.\n\nWith this in mind, here is our cast of merry misfits:\n\n-Borin Gly Hugh Mann the Third, Esquire - myself.  Town's carpenter.  A dirty fighter, and King for the odd-numbered days.  Both the title and power are self appointed.\n\n-Stan Deird Hugh Mann - /u/Lord_Trevarious.  Our mounted fighter.  His horse Hidalgo may be smarter than he is.  Arch-duke when Borin is king.  The town's Doctor's assistant.  Blood letting and leaches might be his only real medicinal skills.\n\n-Gene Eric Hugh Mann - the town's weaver. King for the even-numbered days. The party's chef who can even ruin grandma's home-made wandermeals.  Both the title and power are self appointed.\n\n-Norm Al Hugh Mann - the town butcher.  He carries two weapons.  More recently become obsessed with making the perfect broth.  Has also succeeded in making weapons-grade egg-drop fish soup.\n\n-Ordin Ary Hugh Mann - town vagrant.  Doesn't live at the Mann-sion.  Doesn't wash.  Has a pet owl.  Likes bows and traps.  (group's ranger)\n\n-Wanda Woo Mann - only caster of the group, a cleric. Adopted.  In love with \"Darryl\".  Or so we assume.  May be her \"god\" or so she claims.  She has a town job, but I was on the other side of the table and don't recall.\n\nWe also have a rather large menagerie of pets.  And the world is mostly just a small cluster of settlements on a rather untamed world.\n\nNow, to the story!\n\n--------------------\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nToday marks the greatest achievement of Mann since third-cousin Alwa-Ays (twice removed) showed the world how to play a flute, backwards.  It was quite the feat, but I digress.\n\nIt seemed a normal enough day.  Wanda brooding over her mysterious boyfriend, Darryl.  I had been making minor improvements to Colonel’s coop.  She seemed appreciative, as much as a hen can be.  Gene was doing his kingly duties, as it was his day.  And rather quickly I’d lost track of the others.  When you have as many relatives as come and go from the house of Mann, it’s easy to lose track, even on the best of days.\n\nAll that changed, Diary, when Wanda, I think it was, came running, calling for us to go to the village square.  Muttering something about the king sending a messenger.  Which was odd, as I didn’t send any messengers the day before, and I’m sure Gene wouldn’t send any to himself, either.  So after we arrived, and got that mess sorted, it turned out to be the “real king” as everyone seems to call him, anyhow.  And would you believe it, he came with a mission of great importance, or so he claimed.\n\nAfter some more discussion between everyone, and Wanda trying to make us calm down, finally, we learned that not only is this job a bit of exploration and adventure, they’d pay us.  They fronted us a bit of money, and obviously, for our efforts, we wanted to be sure we could name some of the new settlements that we were to found.  At first, this messenger was only willing to allow us one, so I stepped up.  I haggled for four, and he started to move toward two.  Then Norm felt the need to chime in, and really, he knows cutting meat, why does he always think he should negotiate deals?  Anyhow, he decided to weigh in and offered one!  Just a measly one!  Diary, I could tell you now, I was furious.  As the messenger leapt at that opportunity and shook on it.\n\nWell, the next step was obviously getting permission to go on this job from Grandma Woo.  Skies above if we dared to even visit the next village without her approval.  I may be king some days, but even I’m no fool.  This seemed to confuse the messenger, but he agreed to allow us to get our permission forms signed.\n\nAnd with that, we began preparations.  We were given a whole day, so I was ruling on the day we rode out of village.  The ride was relatively uneventful, though noisy with my newly acquired chickens, Colonel, my beloved hen, and the newest rooster, Chief Petty Officer.  Not to mention Gene and Stan’s dogs.  Thankfully the yak, the donkey and Hidalgo were much quieter.  Even Owlfonso was quiet, much like Ordin.\n\nThe travel started easy enough, while we were still within the borders of our lands.  Aside from raccoons that took an interest in Ordin’s things, it went rather easy.  Gene started to fashion hats from those pelts.  Norm and Stan took to training some of the animals as we were able.  Days passed.  The crown passed between Gene and I, our matched strength meaning none of the others could have bested us for the crown.  After a week, signs of roads and life as we knew it were gone.  Stan was an awful scout, Hidalgo did not look like he traveled far, or long, but I’m no horse doctor.\n\nOne of the nights, with our newly, redesigned camp layout.  Something we decided would defend us better than scattering however we liked, Wanda and Ordin decided to go find some… I don’t know what to say about it.  It was likely as real as her Darryl.  I mean really, some magical fairy creature offering a flute?  It was a stick!  And I thought Ordin was smarter than that.  But I suppose all that time living outside the Mann home has left him a bit nutty.\n\nGene did the only logical thing, and burned the stick they kept saying was a flute, from this magic creature.  And Wanda wrote up a new sign for us.  “DO NOT EAT POISON”.  As if we would forget.\n\nWell diary, my hand is tired.  And I think I need to get used to the wooden creak of my left arm.  When I have more time, I’ll tell you more details.\n\n -Yours,\n King Borin Gly Hugh Mann the Third, Esquire\n\n--------------------\n\nThere is already a part 2 planned, as we've had another session.  I know I missed facts, but I'll chalk it up to Borin forgetting or mis-remembering.\n\nConstructive criticisms welcome!\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "Sorry for the slow posting! Things have been getting quite hectic in the game at the moment, so a lot of my free time is spent on playing instead of writing. \n\n**The story so far: The team are now heroes, having rid the island of elemental cultists. Now that PotA is complete, the virtual DM is left to run wild with its story without the restraint of a module.**\n\n* * *\n\nThe Tsethem are called by name. \n\nFlamer and Co. returned to Orthraze, receiving a hero's welcome from the city. News of the bombing of Rahg Krahv had reached the military there, and Turf's status as a special forces unit meant that their story was heard in full by the officials. They were presented with a medal of honor at a formal ceremony, Captain Veil standing by with pride at how Flamer had proved himself in the eyes of the authorities. The Grand High Commander wasn't present for the ceremony. I'm not sure if he was still wary of a spellcasting warforged, or if he was simply busy. Lundal was also absent; he'd decided that he didn't need no medal from no damn military. \n\nThings were peaceful for about a year. I think there was a bit of an incident with a friend of Della's, who was staying in Orthraze at the Tharth (elvish word for temple or shrine). She decided to become an elemental cultist, or something. The details are a bit fuzzy. What I do remember clearly is that Turf managed to get hold of a wingsuit from the air cultists on one of the cleanup raids. \n\nAt one point during the summer the team decided to meet up again, for that noble quest so many before them had untaken; having a picnic. They met up just outside Rahm Oru (the largest mainland town now that Rahg Krahv was destroyed) and headed off to find a nice spot. \n\nOf course, the virtual DM wouldn't stand for such pleasant peacefulness, so Della discovered a strange basement-like structure while frolicking with Nora the octopus. There they discovered a creepy elf lady who seemed to be kind of confused about where she was. She also kept mentioning an Eye. When pressed as to who she was, she got irritated and vanished. The team explored the dungeon but didn't find anyone else. Just a bunch of shadowy mist and some scales. \n\n* * *\n\nThey should have seen it coming, really. It was only a day or two after the picnic, when they were safely back in Orthraze, that disaster struck. They were gathered on one of the tower-like airship docks to see Flamey and Dell off. The sun was casting a deep orange over the domed roofs and tall spires of the city. Mt. Tirkosu rose up not far to the southeast, icy peaks glistening in the dying light. It was the perfect sunset. \n\nA shadow fell across the land. Heading over the mountain was an enormous black dragon, vaporised shadow pouring from its flapping wings like smoke. It flew with deadly purpose, straight towards the city. \n\nI was thankful beyond belief that the team was hanging out within reach of an airship. They geared up and rolled out on a nifty little ship, soaring over the rooftops to face the dragon as it crossed the city walls. \n\nWhat followed was the longest battle I've ever experienced, despite the relatively small number of combatants. It was exhilarating. The dragon tore into their airship, trying to crash the thing, but the elemental propulsion engines held them aloft. Turf made good use of the wingsuit, leaping from the deck to deliver a few powerful blows before circling back to safety. By this time Flamer had unlocked his elemental wild shape, so he used that in combination with Investiture of Flame to become a superfast, flying, flaming version of himself. His super-saiyan mode, if you will. Lund piloted the craft while Della tried her best to heal them all up. Because man, those breath attacks were deadly. This wasn't a young dragon trapped inside a relatively small cavern, like the one they'd faced before. This was the real deal, and I intended to play her as such. \n\nThey fell. Della was the first to go, tossed off the airship and landing a few hundred feet below. Turf and Lundal were consumed by shadow breath. Flamer only survived because his sheer speed allowed him to easily escape the dragon. As he stumbled to a halt on the slopes of Mt Tirkosu, the immense creature that had defeated the city's heroes offered a victory roar to the heavens. The team, at long last, were defeated. \n\nThere was no way Flamey could take on the creature by himself. So he hatched a plan, one of the most risky ones I've seen in all my time playing D&amp;D. He would travel back to the fire node, disguise himself as a fire elemental, use Tinderstrike to summon Imix to the island, and persuade him to take down the only threat bigger than the eternal flame himself: the shadow dragon residing in Orthraze. \n\nAnd it worked. The wild shape was enough to fool Imix into believing he was a trusted servant of elemental evil, and his earnest plea to destroy the dragon was heard. While Imix led as many fire elementals as were on hand through the portal, Flamer slipped away and headed back to Orthraze. He arrived there a day before the fire army and used that time to observe the dragon. A dark, stagnated shadow had fallen over the once grand city. To drive the last of the inhabitants and defenders out, she appeared to have enlisted the help of the Mirlings; a bunch of subterranean races that act as dark reflections of their surface counterparts. The dragon was gathering a fair portion of her army together outside the walls, preparing for a march. Flamer guessed that they were going to head to Little Orthraze, the Gnomish seaside town just a few miles north. Time was running out. \n\nThe fire army struck that night. Imix's soldiers ate up the ground as they charged towards the city, leaving the ruins of Rahm Oru in flames along with several acres of jungle. The shadow dragon waited until they were in reach of the walls to engage, which was probably a fatal error on her part. Imix was a lot faster than her, and his attacks were brutal. They wrestled together across the rooftops, obliterating the few standing buildings beneath their ferocious onslaught. Fire smote shadow, and soon the dragon was fleeing for her life. But there was no escape from the all-consuming fire. \n\nFlamer had taken advantage of the commotion to slip into the city centre. A couple of locational scans (*Find Object*) detected the corpses of his friends. He found them in front of the dragon's temporary lair, impaled into the wall with spikes and leaking necrotic ooze from their eyes. It was horrific. He didn't waste time, taking them quickly to a hidden bunker beneath the military headquarters and boarding a prototype airship. He escaped the carnage of Imix and the dragon, heading out over Mt. Tirkosu. Beneath them, in a confusing move at the time, the Mirlings turned on their former leader and joined the ranks of the fire army. \n\n* * *\n\nFlamey wasn't a healer. No one on the island except Della was powerful enough to use resurrection magic. So he did the only thing he could, and cast *Reincarnate*. \n\nNow this was a lot more risky than it might at first seem, because I was using a custom list of reincarnation races. Although the main ten races of Empai Tirkosu were the most likely (followed by genasi), I had every single official and semi-official race on there. Della could have ended up as a half-orc, a svirfnerblin, or even a vampire. She was incredibly lucky. The dice decided she would become a full human, essentially losing her Elven side. She had never known her parents, having been discovered on the steps of Appinamopu Tharth as a baby. Her Elven heritage was all she had of her father, so losing it was a crushing blow. She resurrected Lund and Turf, then quietly retreated below decks to weep. \n\nThe rest of the team wasn't in high spirits either. Flamer explained to them what they'd missed, and Turf was furious. By getting Imix to destroy the dragon, he had only replaced one deadly foe with a much more dangerous one. There was no way they were going to defeat him without help. \n\nBut help was at hand. Landing at the wicker monastery of Hepthurai, they were greeted by the Aaracokran elder who informed them of a resistance group assembling at Paku, the Elven village. The elder also told them of a prophecy concerning such a time as this, when shadow and fire would collide again, as in the days long before the island had a name. He showed them a map, marking a point high on the mountain. When they arrived there via airship they found a marble statue of an angel, which became a real, living version of its depiction when Della prayed to it for help. The angel said she had been placed here to defend the island in its darkest hour by the Supreme One, the most commonly worshiped deity on Empai Tirkosu, and also the god Della worshipped. She agreed to fight alongside the team to take down Imix. With her aid, they had a fighting chance. \n\n* * *\n\nThey headed to Paku to meet up with the resistance. Grand High Commander Strell was there, having escaped the city thanks to the actions of Captain Veil. It was rather awkward for Flamer, as this was the first time they had met face to face since Strell had given the order to terminate him. The Commander greeted him like an old friend however, and soon they were discussing battle tactics together. \n\nThe gist of the plan was, the resistance would take on the combined Mirling and fire elemental army at the gates, while Turf would lead her team and the angel past enemy lines and take on Imix himself. It worked out smoothly enough: they snuck into the treasury Imix was using as an HQ using Turf's merge with stone ability, and soon came upon the head honcho. They struck with blinding speed, but it wasn't enough: the angel fell beneath the onslaught of fire. They were out on a limb, without otherworldly backup, facing an enemy they couldn't hope to defeat alone.\n\nSo Flamer did something crazy again, and snapped Tinderstrike.\n\nNow, each elements weapon is supposed to contain a shard of its creator. Snapping one unleashes that shard, but as a separate entity. It was as though a pale reflection of Imix unfurled from the dagger as Flamer ripped it in two. So now they were facing two Imixes, one undoubtedly weaker than the first but still a prominent threat. I thought they were certainly doomed.\n\nBut the virtual DM decided to be gracious that day. Imix, seeing this new version of himself appear before him, decided quite rightly that having a second insane megalomaniac running about the world was actually a threat to his safety. So he attacked, and the rest of the team stood back and watched while they beat each other up. It was child's play to dispatch the winner of the tussle, having already been softened up for them. Outside along the walls of Orthraze, the Mirlings fell beneath the sword and the fire elementals fled to the hills, fearing whoever had the power to destroy their almighty prince. \n\n* * *\n\nThey stood among the ruins of their civilisation. Shadow brought down order, and fire had destroyed what remained. The darkness that had followed the dragon wasn't dissipating, reanimating the corpses of the Mirlings every few hours to prowl the twisted wreckage again. All but a few airships had been destroyed in the assault. The humans, Dwarves, and Warforged who once called the city home now had nowhere to live. They couldn't simply build a new city right next to it, due to Tirkosu's unique planar structure; as the plane was constantly being \"fed\" by the ten elemental planes, any structure built in an unstable zone would eventually disappear, sometimes along with any occupants. They were without guidance, without the comfort of the city's technology, and without hope.\n\nSo they turned to their protectors, Turf, Flamer, Della, and Lundal, calling upon them by a name that would resonate throughout the course of the island's history. They turned to their Tsethem, the Elvish word for protector. And so the heroes led their new followers into greener pastures, as behind them in the last light of the dying human empire, Orthraze burned.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nSo that kinda gives you an idea of what sort of crazy stuff goes on when the virtual DM isn't confined to a module. Jon us next time when we start Horde of the Dragon Queen, and throw out half the book because it doesn't fit with the island's geography. ",

Dejectedly the player went back to room A to await resurrection.\n\nI've never before seen the players feeling so obviously \"we did a bad thing\" before, though they did say it would have been fine if they'd lucked out and summoned the ranger instead.\n\nTell me of your Halloween madness :D any good stories to share?",

        "text": "Hello r/gametales ! You might remember my story of how the party’s barbarian slept with a dragon and was fooled into accidentally kidnapping a young Dragonborn? Well, this story follows on from that one. \n\nThe Dragonborn tribe were easily placated after the Barbarian explains what happened, and after a quick biology lesson for him the little Dragonborn speaks up: he liked adventures! Could his father and him join the party for just one adventure? \n\nEnter stage left, the new PC. Our wizard had been slain (never underestimate a vampire, more on this another time) and he had made a Dragonborn monk. \n\nWith the 2 new Dragonborn joining the party, they set out into a dwarven mine to find loot. The entire party, apparently not learning from the perception check story, fails to notice a pitfalll trap and falls all the way to the underdark, where they are captured by Drow monks.\n\nWhen the party come to they are imprisoned in a monastery. The Dragonborn monk recognises it and reveals it isn’t the first time he’s been captured by these Drow, blah blah blah the long and short of it is they killed his parents on a raid, and took him as a slave, one of the Drow trained him and then he escaped. \n\nThis time however, he didn’t just escape. He blocked every window, every door, every possible escape route.... then chucked a bottle of alchemist’s fire through a tiny hole and left. \n\nThe PCs stood and watched the monastery burn, as they watched they saw the monastery was built on top of a strange metal surface...\n\nLong story short it’s an ilithid (mindflayer) ship, and they have been manipulated events in an effort to perform a certain ritual. PCs intervene. This took about 2 (4 if we include the ones about the dragon and young Dragonborn) sessions, and at the end the Fighter turns to the Barbarian and says:\n\n“Please never seduce a dragon again” ",

        "text": "About a month ago I was playing a Pathfinder game with my usual game night group, and our party was given a quest by a local king to rescue a princess from a Dragon-held Keep, which is fairly standard adventuring fare.\n\nBefore we get further, I should break down the party a little;\n\n* Elven Alchemist (me) who spent so long brewing potions he's perpetually  in a slight semi-high\n\n*Half-Elf Cleric who Charisma'd their way to being the Party Leader\n\n*Half-Orc Monk who  toes the line between Stoic Ascetic and Life of the Party\n\n*Half-Orc barbarian with 6 INT and next to no impulse control.\n\nAs our heroic adventurers make their way through a hidden tunnel into the keep, we suddenly emerge inside of the jail cell the Princess is being kept in. As she was not expecting a pair of hulking Half orcs, a gleaming Cleric, or an Elf that smelled like saltpeter and potion reagents, she immediately screams at the top of her lungs, alerting the Lizardfolk guard outside her cell to our presence.\n\nAs the Lizardfolk guard was quite unprepared for a heavily armed adventuring party appearing five feet from his face, he freaks out, charges at us with his sword... and misses.\n\nNormally the story would end here, the Barbarian would summarily behead the yowling Lizardfolk, and we'd take the princess back the way she came.\n\nNope.\n\nInstead, the guard overcharged so bad he ended up inside of the secret tunnel, and just guess what his sword managed to catch on.\n\nThe party hears the crack of wood, a mighty rumble is felt throughout the room, and the sound of splitting stone kills the air around us.\n\nAs the dirt and dust slowly clear, we see a single reptilian leg buried under the mountain of rubble that used to be our escape route. Additionally, during the ruckus, the princess managed to hit her head on a piece of stone and was out cold.\n\nSince the princess didn't have Mythic Power™ she would have been unable to use our teleporting MacGuffins we got a few adventures back to leave, so as a group we elected to prop her against the wall as we searched for an easier way out.\n\nWe progress through the dungeon with little enough resistance, slaughtering Lizardfolk and Extremely Minor Dragons until we come to a closed door. We try and stealthily open up and...\n\n[Dracolisk!](http://th08.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2013/152/7/c/dracolisk_by_katepfeilschiefter-d67hbtt.jpg)\n\nBecause Dragons are far too easy, they clearly need to be able to petrify you with a single stare.\n\nAt any rate, the party turns tail and books it for cover while the 'lisk lies in wait, almost like a lion waiting to pounce it it's prey.\n\nOut of character, we try and brainstorm a way to counteract the petrification. We come to several dead ends and start to get genuinely frustrated until the Barbarian's player speaks up.\n\n\"I dump out my Bag of Holding, dash forward, and jam it over the Dracoslisk's head.\"\n\nHe makes his save to avoid the Dracolisk's gaze, shoves the bag over its head and down to its front legs, rendering it almost completely helpless ([In the DM's words, \"You know what, fuck it. The Dracolisk is now Blind and flailing in a futile attempt to shake off the bag\"](https://i.imgur.com/t1VtXOU.jpg)).\n\nThe Monk and Barbarian get *Enlarge Person* potions from my Alchemist and *Bull's Strength* from the Cleric, allowing them to decimate an incredibly threatening monster in about two or three combat rounds. The bag was even perfectly fine after its ordeal!\n\nWe saunter through the rest of the keep feeling like real hotshots, when all of a sudden the building starts shaking and collapsing from the Lizardfolk's structural damage from earlier and...\n\nNah of course that didn't happen, I'm just messing with you.\n\nCould you just imagine it though.\n\nAt any rate, we successfully dispatch the (small-ish) Dragon with only minor third degree burns, retrieve the princess, and head back to the city the long way.\n\nAll in all, everything went better than expected.\n\n*Adapted from [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/788ctn/in_the_bag/) to r/dndgreentext*",
