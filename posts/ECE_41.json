I think I would be much more satisfied creating electronics and gadgets. (I know this doesn't make me special or qualified in any way, just mentioning it to lend some sort of credence to the idea that this would be a more fulfilling path for me.)\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nI am currently a ChemE in oil and gas and it's not very fulfilling. Pay is great, job isn't stressful, but its just a job. Even though I am primarily a design engineer for new/expansion facilities, I'm not really creating anything (I rarely see it after the dwgs are Issued for Construction). In the end, I'm not passionate about the field (oil).\n\nI do calculations and simulations all to spec a piece of equipment that has been manufactured time and time again for many decades. There's some problem solving and troubleshooting involved, but not at the frequency that really stimulates me mentally.\n\nNot to mention that I just feel like I've surrounded myself by a group of people that I don't have much in common with, being primarily and tech nerd myself.\n\n**CONCERNS**\n\nBut again, I'm concerned about putting the time in and then becoming a \"code monkey\" if I went software side, or not finding that creative engineering career I am looking for on the hardware side.",

My church's bell tower is centered off an electronic carillon system that uses cassette-tape like tapes to play different bell sounds, patterns, songs, etc. The big box itself is a Verdin brand, but so old that we can't find much info on it. \nThe box reads the magnetic tape when it runs, and the sound comes out of two speakers in the bell tower. Recently we noticed that the magnetic tape is starting to warp on several tapes. Without them, we'd have to have someone use a pull rope for an actual bell. The tapes also aren't made anymore, and no church in the area has a similar set of tapes that we can get from them.\nOne Sunday I followed the out cable of the bell box into the wall, where I found that it simple is two thick copper wires spliced to to other copper wires and, I assume, that simple leads up to the speakers with nothing in the middle. \nThinking I had a lead, I used a aux cable that I took an end off of and spliced that directly the copper wires leading to the speakers, after I undid the bell box wires. I tried to use an iPod to play a song through the spliced aux wire, but, even at full volume, no sound comes out of the speakers in the bell tower. \nI assume there's roughly between two and three hundred feet of copper wire between the exposed wire and the speaker. \n\nWhy am is no sound coming out of the speakers? Is the output of the iPod not strong enough? Any relevant help or suggestions are appreciated\n(PS I know Jack about electrical work.)",

I'm planning on putting a fuse, common mode choke, Y-capacitors, and a MOV on the primary side, and I'm wondering what my component placement should be like. \n\nSo my current idea is that the 120VAC will branch off from my terminals in 2 paths. \n\nOne path goes to the MOV -&gt; fuse -&gt; choke -&gt; Y-capacitors and earth ground -&gt; transformer. \n\nThe other path goes directly to the two TRIACs I'm using to switch the heating elements on with. Does this sound viable? Do you think I need anything between the TRIACs and the line voltage (besides a fuse)? The heating elements aren't an inductive load so I have a feeling I can just juice them with the line voltage through the TRIACs.\n\nAny information would be much appreciated. Up until this point I have only really worked with digital circuits and medium voltage DC. Any good reading material on power supply design would be a major help as well, thanks.",

Our monitoring signal is 72 seconds long, and to sample the oscillator correctly during modulation (fm_mod) means trying to create too large a time vector. I could use interp1() to match the less dense message vector to the 8x.x MHz oscillator waveform vector...except of course, not enough memory.\n\nMy question is, do we need to adhere to Nyquists Theorem when mixing our oscillator with our message signal during modulation, or can we apply that 2*pi*fc*t to a time vector that contains WAY fewer points than would be needed to properly represent a 8x.x MHz waveform?",

I like a lot of things about this potential job: everyone is friendly and easy to work with, company culture is very laid-back, the project I am working on is pretty cool, and I have a ton of ownership / influence in this project. \n\nThe bad thing about this job is that there is little oversight or mentorship. I am creating a microcontroller-based tool / platform that will be used internally, so I do get feedback from other engineers on requirements and behavior... but no one reads my code or reviews my progress. Part of the reason is that our development process is really minimal - we basically don't do code reviews or automated testing, for example. \n\nThe other half of the problem is that we don't have anyone with significant firmware experience. We have some 'high level' software people that have dabbled in microcontrollers or otherwise have experience with automation (programming PLCs, writing PC-based applications to control 'black box' embedded devices and sensors, etc). So I do get some advice on high-level design issues and general software craftsmanship - when I ask for it - but no one there knows C or microcontrollers nearly as well as I do. And I'm not bragging when I say that - I consider it a bad thing, because I still have a lot to learn about embedded development. \n\nI have improved my firmware skills a fair amount from reading stack overflow, various blogs, and just figuring things out for myself, but I'm not sure this is good enough for a new grad...\n\nWhat do you think?",

Within the year, I will be working on turning a graduate design project into a medical device that will need FDA clearance, and that means meeting IEC60601 electrical safety requirements. \n\nI have a copy of the standard, and while I believe I understand the language and basic intent of most of the relevant sections on electrical safety, I still find the idea of implementing a conforming design to be very unclear. To my amazement, I can't seem to find a single worked example to demonstrate execution of the standard.\n\nWhat I would like to do is post a hypothetical circuit (as simple as possible, not even one that does anything useful) that includes the bare minimum components, and accumulate suggestions, tips, advice, or any valuable insight from any community members might care to share. This is sounding a little crazy as I write it, but I really think it would be tremendously useful to anybody trying to design for electrical safety standards, myself included.\n\nHere's a bare bones circuit. http://imgur.com/0OtVDiu\n\nPower supply. A little analog section with connections going out to the patient. A little digital section with a USB connection to the outside world. Let's say that circuit \"works\", but no attempt has yet been made to make it 60601 compliant.\n\nIf you already knew what you were doing, what is step 1? Identify the 'applied part' as defined by the standard? Is there more than one applied part? What about step 2? Determine which device class you plan to design for (Class I or Class II)? Step 3? Identify working voltages?\n\nI hope this gets off the ground.",

        "text": "Hey ECE!\n\nI'm starting an electrical engineering program in the fall, but the ECE nerd inside me can't wait to be unleashed before then! I have a DIY project that I would like to try to accomplish before school starts. I'm looking for some guidance on how to go about it.\n\nPROBLEM:\n- My family's vehicles get broken into on a regular basis (approximately once a month). The culprits are pretty seasoned at it. We've purchased security cameras, but they wear masks and cover themselves reasonably well so that there isn't really any information we can give the police, and we never find out until the next morning. Basically, my family really sucks at remembering to lock the  vehicles, and we find the glove box left open and rummaged through the morning after. We all try to remember to lock it all the time, but it seems like we get complacent until the vehicle gets rummaged through again (then we remember to lock it again for awhile). We file police reports regularly and the police try to patrol the area frequently, but really the only way this problem is going to get solved is by catching the person in the act. It happens regularly enough that I can say the following happens every time:\n- The culprit comes in on a bike, checks vehicle car doors, and if opened, he will take his time rummaging through the vehicle. He will not damage the vehicle.\n- Usually it is petty things that are stolen like CDs or change. Many times we don't even know if he took anything at all. However last time, he stole our mail key so we had to get the mailbox locks changed.\n- He takes his time in the vehicle, usually spends at least 7 or 8 minutes inside.\n- The glove box is ALWAYS left open. It's pretty much how we know it's been rummaged through.\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION:\nObviously locking the door is the best solution. But that's not a fun DIY project. Also, it seems like whenever someone forgets to lock the door, that's the night the shitbag is out. Of course we don't notice the times he comes and the vehicles are locked. Anyway, a better solution would be a silent alarm that phones a preprogrammed number (my cell phone) when the glove box is opened. We never open the glove box. Basically I imagine that I would receive a phone call from the alarm's phone number when the glove box is opened (which would wake me up), I would see the caller ID, I would cancel the call, and I would call the police immediately. Since he takes his time in the vehicles and often tries every vehicle in my court, the police would have a good chance at catching him. Also we could basically treat this like a sting operation and remove all valuables from the vehicle, leave the vehicle unlocked every night, and then catch him in the act. Because the alarm is silent, we could even attempt it multiple times. This may or may not be feasible, but here's how I imagine this to work:\n- Purchase a \"pay as you go\" phone, and somehow connect it to the vehicle's battery so it doesn't run out of juice.\n- Purchase something like a magnetic door contact to act as the trigger.\n- Purchase something like a raspberry pi and also hook it into the car battery to act as the controller for the system (I don't know if this is even necessary).\n\nI've never purchased any of this equipment nor have I tinkered with anything like this before, but given the basic function I feel like it could be a good beginner project. Given how seemingly simple this is, I don't even know if programming is necessary, but so you can gauge my skill level:\n- I have learned some basic programming (I've written some decently sophisticated VBA excel macros, and have also taken a few codeacademy courses like python and MySQL). I'm also about halfway through the EdX CS50 course that glosses over some other basic programming. I would consider myself not even a script kiddie, but am willing to put in the time to learn the necessary programming if it is needed.\n\nQUESTIONS FOR r/ECE:\n- Does anybody know how much time and money this will take, given my newbie skill level?\n- Where can I purchase all the necessary equipment for this project? Are there materials/brands I should stay away from?\n- Is there anything that I am missing? Is there a better solution to the problem that is more effective and also inexpensive?\n- If programming is needed, what language should it be in? Python?\n- Are there any online learning resources I can find that will help me figure this out? For starters, how to hook stuff up to a car battery, and how to make a cheap phone make an automated phone call to a preprogrammed number?",

During the good job market of 2011-2014 when I was looking out for jobs I could not join a big company due to some personal issues. Now that I have again started searching for jobs I see a very poor job market ahead with poor jobs.\n\nThe career advise that I get from most people is that I should not worry about jobs and go after the company which offers good money even if the job is terrible. I really cannot get my mind to it and it is very depressing for all the work that I have put in improving myself (although I know that it does not matter to anybody except me). I am a really core engineering person with deep understanding of embedded systems and have good debugging skills. I have validated this when I compared myself with my peers or during job interviews. Due to this I really want to get a good job but all I find is some really stupid bug fixing or general support. In big companies the development work is very very less but their interviews are very intense. For eg: For a bluetooth position that I had interviewed for and clearing it, the interviewer told me that the core bluetooth code is rarely changed and if at all it is done it is for spec changes only. This scares the hell out of me as I know that I my skills will atrophy.\n\nIn my present company too good work is a hit or a miss. Due to this I spend quite a lot of time on my personal projects be it writing my own bluetooth stack for micro-controllers or developing a bare metal firmware and a development kit for ARM SoCs.\n\nI really need some advise on how to handle my career. Are my aspirations irrational and am I being too impractical?\n\n*Edit: More specific.",

A critical part to this is measuring the current for battery management.\n\nThe max current flow will be 100A (max battery discharge).\nThe min current flow will be about -5A (max battery charge current).\n\nI ran into a problem with the current sensing when it gets hot, namely the Seebeck effect.\nThe problem is that the current sensing element (sense resistor) will be a different material from the PCB copper, and the sense resistor temp will be different than the chip temp used for current sensing. Therefore, I will run into the Seebeck effect (thermocouple effect).\n\nThis is a problem because when the sensing element is hot and I have 0A current flowing, my sensing element will detect a small negative current and this creates a false reading on the current sense. The messes up the battery management.\n\nI cannot heatsink the two points together to negate the temperature difference.\nI cannot blank out the small current with code because I'm using a proprietary Texas Instruments battery management part (part number BQ34Z100-G1) that won't allow me access to that level of control.\n\nIs there a solution to my problem or is it something I just have to live with and figure out some inefficient workaround?",

        "text": "So im taking the nand2tetris course, and it's difficult but interesting. Im on the first project: http://nand2tetris.org/01.php\n\nWhere you are building basically all the gates out of other gates (starting with NOT which you build with just NAND gate).\n\nI understand HDL so far, but my confusion lies in the steps to actually figure this out.\n\nFor instance NOT was actually confusing for me since I didn't even know the steps to take. First step I tried was making the NOT truth table, and then basically mapping that out to NOT(a) = (a NAND a) but the only reason I knew that was based on the proof they showed us. I would never think of that myself.\n\nOnce I got NOT, AND was the same way (Doing (X and Y) = NOT(X NAND Y)), again...only knowing that cause they told us.\n\nIm on OR now, and tried to work backwards and I was just stumped. I finally saw something called the involution law (which was never listed in the laws) which is saying A = (A')' , so I thought ok here's how Ill do it:\n\n    (A+B) = (A' + B')' (Involution)\n    (A' + B')' = (A')' AND (B')' (De'Morgans)\n\nthen I saw where someone says THAT is equal to (A' AND B')' (Not sure what law that is, but it makes sense?)\n\nFrom there I can build the gate (as I had created NOT and AND previous to this).\n\nSo the steps make sense, but I have no idea really how to approach these. Obviously I want to avoid looking at schematics as that defeats the whole purpose.....but man I feel absolutely stupid. Should it be easier than this? I guess should I just take something and basically work backwards to a form that's reasonable?\n\nThen there come gates without obvious boolean expressions, like a MUX or DEMUX....no clue where to even start with those.\n\nThanks!",

I discovered that I love \"low-level\" coding when I took an assembly course in my junior year with a really badass instructor. \n\nIf I were able to go back in time and start over I'd probably major in EE or CE. However, it would not be pragmatic for me to switch majors at this point when you consider the steep additional costs and delay in graduation. \n\nI've been researching for quite a while the kind of knowledge that I require to be a professional embedded developer. So far I've taken an assembly class, an OS class, networking class, and a systems class (see Computer Systems a Programmer's Perspective) \n\nI also started reading a book on C and I'm currently working my through the UT Austin Embedded Systems classes on Coursera. \n\nFrom my pov, my main weakness is with electronics and circuit stuff. My only exposure to those areas was basic college physics. \n\nOne skill that I read again and again as being important with microcontrollers is debugging. Now, keep in mind that I'm learning on my own here. I have no access to a proper EE lab since my program is online. I consider myself an autodidact though and I'm willing to buy some of my own tools but only what's necessary and for as cheap as possible. \n\nShould I buy an oscilloscope or a logic analyzer? Looking at prices, I can't afford both right now. One microcontroller tutorial I looked through suggested this logic analyzer :\n\nhttps://www.adafruit.com/product/378?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8ayw2LXT1QIVUVp-Ch1gGgs6EAAYAiAAEgI0tPD_BwE\n\nOther reading I've done says that an oscilloscope reports back different information. Which would be more beneficial in learning debugging? If an oscilloscope is what I need, what is a cheap but effective learning model? \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",

In the past, I worked at my student union and was a student supervisor of other students. I don't really want to return to that job because 1) it's boring and menial and 2) the pay sucks. When trying to find student jobs, though, most of what I see are completely incompatible with my hours. They generally seek 15-20 hours worth of work per week between 8am-5pm Monday through Friday, and I have only 13 spare possible hours in that time. What types of jobs would you recommend to me, as a student, that are even loosely related to ECE and a student could work part-time? I recently applied for a student technician job but those hours wouldn't work.",

Which is making it difficult for me to figure out if I want to keep trying to get into the major or switch to another. \n\nFrom what I've read online, working in Embedded Systems (which is what I think I'm most interested in) often means spending a lot of time reading Data Sheets trying to figure out how to make two pieces of hardware communicate. To me, this sounds similar to how a lawyer or legal aid would go through endless case histories to prepare for court.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/6stxec/verilog_in_cadence_spectre_how/",
        "text": "Recently I found the need to do some testing to benchmarks in verilog (iscas to be exact). Apparently  the task requires using cadence spectre to run some analysis such as power consumption. I'm fairly unfamiliar with using spectre, and from what I saw online it seems that spectre only accept verilog-a or spice, but not plain verilog? Is it actually possible to read verilog into spectre, or do I need to convert verilog into something else, like spice? Advice and tips are greatly appreciated!\n\nForgive me if I asked a stupid question: I really don't have much experience in these fields :(\n\nEdit: I'm using verilog coming from here : http://www.pld.ttu.ee/~maksim/benchmarks/iscas85/verilog/ (such as c6288, c7552)",
