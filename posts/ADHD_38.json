How do I go about asking my parents to check for ADHD or something like that? I don't feel like doing it for some reason i'm just so scared people will think lesser of me If I fail it.

I can’t sleep for the LIFE of me, even if I can shut off my brain I’ve been getting restless legs like crazy to the point where it physically pains me, I’ve got constant chatter in my brain and the same five songs going at once, and to top it all off it hasn’t been alleviating ADHD symptoms — if anything, they’re worse! I can concentrate better than when I’m not on them, but I’m still wildly distractible and constantly dopamine-seeking and have to reel myself back in.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Did my doctor use a different brand or was there a mixup or something? I’m not taking it today because I can’t bear these side effects any longer, and I’m going to call the doctor and ask for some clarity, but in the meantime I’d love for anyone in the community to help me feel like I’m not going crazy right now!",

My therapist suspected I have depression and referred me to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist doesn't think I have depression, but he said I have a lot of signs of ADHD (the inattentive type). He asked me some things on my childhood and adolescence, and then he said that he doesn't want to give me tests or ask people from my environment, he prefers to \"try it out\" directly with ritalin. Meaning, I will take ritalin for 8 days, and at the end of the 8 days I will see him again and see if I respond to it. If the effects are positive, this will \"confirm\" the diagnosis. I am not sure this is the way it's normally done, and I am really hesitant to take this. \nI wasn't sure if this question complies with the rules of the group, if not, please delete this. It's just that I don't know where else to ask. Thank you in advance.",

        "text": "Clickbaity title. Sorry. Also posting from alt account.  \n\n\nI have been seeing my therapist for 2 years now. She's helped me become a better husband, a better father and she helped me get confident enough to go for a diagnosis and then helped me and pushed me to get the meds.   \n\n\nThe impact this woman has had on my life is immense. The last time I saw her she told me that she's leaving the practice and will work with Trauma victims and Refugees. I don't blame her or hate her. I think she's a wonderful person. I have catastrophized about this for so long so it wasn't a complete shock.   \n\n\nShe had tears in her eyes. I just couldn't make eye contact with her. She told me that therapy is supposed to come to an end. But this end is just for different reasons. I still have 3 months with her and I'm going to go every single week.  \n\n\nI know it sounds dumb but I think she was the only friend I had. I mean I know I was paying her and it's not like I was her friend because I made sure to not ask too many private details from her. I rationally understand that she was doing her job. But she was the only real person I could talk to. I had a routine going with her. I would be happy to be able to finally get everything out. She was keeping track of my emotions and my life. She was like my own personal historian.  \n\n\nWhen I was falling into patterns she already knew she would warn me. She would help me think through my struggles. She helped me feel better about myself, my upbringing and my life.  \n\n\nMy wife asked me that now that's she's not my therapist she can just become a friend and we can hangout. I know logically that's not appropriate since the relationship was never reciprocal and it would be like asking free therapy of her.  \n\n\nI want to ask her to give me her email but then again, I don't want to leech off her for free therapy.   \n\n\nI didn't cry infront of her. I know she feels bad about it too. But it's a decision she wants to take. I understand that she wants to have an impact. I want her to go into it knowing that I'm fine. But I'm not. I'm not. I'm crying as I write this. I think about it and I feel hollow.   \n\n\nIt's like for the first time in my life I had a confidant. Someone who was there for me. Maybe I just need friends. But I suck at friendships. I just wanted to hug her and cry. But that's inappropriate. I feel so sad.   \n\n\nSo it does feel like a break up. It does feel like this will never get better. I know that it's dumb. I know I'm being stupid. It's a relationship I valued so much that it hurts.  \n\n\nApologies for the sob story. I just want to know if any of you had experience with this and how you dealt with it.",

I'm on day 4 today and now at last it does something again. \n\nIs this normal/known effect? Anyone found anything that helped you increase the effect, or do I just have to accept I will be unproductive that week? \n\n**Other external factors:** \n\n* I do not sleep well during my period, and this generally causes the meds to be less effective regardless \n* I am generally more lethargic during period and have heavy cramps and bleeding, regardless of being medicated or not",

I only eat when I'm whether starving or suddenly binge eat whatever I find in my home, I'm scared to let people enter my apartment because it's such a mess even I don't like it, I only went twice to the supermarket since the beginning of the year, I rely on the sandwiches I buy for lunch with my friends and eat nothing else because I have nothing at home or at least nothing I feel like eating, my sleep schedule is non-existent, I don't freak out anymore when I loose something, I'm just disappointed in me and feel resigned and it happens daily (sometimes really important things like my jacket or the 200€ my I received for my birthday, guess I'll just be cold and poor, don't care it's my fault and as long as no one knows it, it's only my problem).\n\n I also am running late for my homework, had three sleepless nights last week, one of them being me stuck outside on the streets because I lost my keys. I wash my clothes on the shower because I can't go to the laundry when it's only 10 minutes aways, I do the dishes only when I need it and have accumulated a ton of empty bottles because I can't throw them with the normal trash yet I'm not even looking for a glass container. I booked 4 different train tickets before I found the one (didn't take a national strike into consideration, then forgot about an appointement, then booked for the wrong day, then booked for the wrong direction -hopefully I didn't lose any money-). \n\nAnd it's everyday like this, stupid mistakes, oversights, things not getting done, me not sleeping enough, or oversleeping, binging or not eating at all, poor body image and self-hatred. I also realized recently that most of the people see me as an alien. At my school, I get along super well with most of my comrades (wasn't the case in highschool) but I came back home for a training with my team (we don't know each other very well) and everyone was staring at me, waiting for me to do or say something weird when I just acted normal. I wrote to much. I'm not diagnosed with Adhd but my therapist is seriously considering it, and i just thought this might be the right place to reach the right people. Do you have any tips to get (back?) on track please?",

        "text": "I know a lot of us have this problem - with ourselves, and maybe with other ADHD people in our lives. \n\nI've done it myself. That feeling that if you just _try harder_, or that maybe this time you can _make_ yourself do the thing? \n\nAnd it doesn't work that time either. \n\nDopamine starvation is always a high priority issue in your brain. The only things that are _higher_ priority are things that are catastrophic. And even then you might not be able to _sustain_ that focus for long. \n\nYou'll never be able to 'just exercise' because you need to get fit (and/or lose weight). The motivation is just not there. No dopamine means your brain just can't register the motivation, and you'll go doomscroll, or play a video game, or zone out instead. \n\nThat's true of many things in your life in different ways. It's not a problem of _laziness_ or a need to _try harder_. It's your motivational circuits aren't working properly.\n\nMedication helps with that. It's not quite as trivial as 'add dopamine; do thing' but it's not _too_ far off.\n\nBut there's also other ways to get that dopamine, which makes an activity engaging and motivational without medication. It needs less mental energy to do that thing in the first place. \n\nTo go back to the previous example - exercise. Lets face it, it's pretty much always boring to run on a treadmill, or bash an erg, or do a bajillion reps of something. \n\nBut if you're doing something fun, that's also energetic, it will be a lot easier - or indeed possible in the first place - to self motivate. \n\nSo maybe you need to start learning to dance. Or a martial art. Or a sport of some kind. (Although if you're a general misanthrope like me, then some sports won't suit you - but I do like cycling and spin classes). Or maybe it's an 'energetic' video game, like beat saber or a dance game. Maybe it's taking your dog out for a run, instead of taking your dog out for a walk. \n\nBribe your brain into doing the right thing, don't try and bully it. \n\nNote: this also goes with motivating other people/children with ADHD. All you accomplish by coercing someone is to build resentment and distrust, and supporting them and finding a motivation will work a lot better. \n\nIt probably goes for 'everyone else' as well to an extent - this isn't purely an 'ADHD thing' - but 'fear of consequences/long term reward' is a lot easier to 'register' and find motivating in a non-ADHD brain, even in situations where it's suboptimal.",

Despite years of college, I have no degree, no drivers license, and I haven't had a job in three years.

No amount of breakdowns or fights has ever ended with me actually doing something about my situation, only me ending back up in the hospital or the ward. ADHD meds aren't an option for me, as I'm bottom-of-the-barrel poor and loving in the rural American south with little free or cheap options for psychiatric help. Trust me, I've tried 😭..\n\nI feel paralyzed. I know I'm not lazy and that I'd do anything to get out of here, but every day I wake up and watch my body ignore my hygiene, my plans, my obligations. I watch as my room becomes unlivable, as my body screams for food or exercise. It's like a prison within a prison. \n\nI'm avoiding the gruesome details, but I hope this paints the picture. I feel as though nobody could ever understsnd this, that it's all my fault- but I've just realized tonight (it is 3 am and I've just come down from my nightly panic attack), that this might have something to do with my ADHD. and that maybe someone out there was also in this cycle, this mental prison.\n\nI'm sorry for the wall of text, I know I couldn't get through this myself without skipping most of it and struggling to process it. I tried to be brief, but it's hard to in this case.

        "text": "Got diagnosed a couple of days ago. I finaly feel validated, as i understand where most of my exhaustion and braing fog is coming from(used to think it was all due to crohns). I thought i would get to use stimulants as ive read alot of positive things about them but i only got perscribed Strattera. Apparently i cant start taking stims as an adult.If i got diagnosed as a child and stared taking them in childhood, i could continue to use them into adulthood. But starting them in adulthood apparently leads to addiction if i remember correctly. Im from Slovenia(EU).  \n\n\nJust curious, how are things in US regarding stimulants? Is it permited to start using them in adult life?  \nAnd how would i know when strattera starts working?Apparently its not as strong as stimulants, and it doesnt even work for some.  \n\n\nThose that Strattera works for you, how much did it affect you life? Was it obvious when it started working?I started with 25mg 5 days ago and was told i should up my dosage by 25mg avery ten days if i feel noo improvement.Up to 75mg. So far i just feel some nausea and...maybe i feel different a bit i dont know for sure. Thing is, im also recovering from an operation on my intestines so at least part of the nause comes from that. Its tricky to figure things out while having having overlapping medical issues :/.",

I recently had my 28th birthday and hate to admit how little progress I've made since 25 etc. I have a problem. Adderall and Vyvanse allow me to mentally focus on difficult tasks (coding especially), but my medication has always caused horrible side effects.   \n\n\nI get skin sores when I take it for more than a week as my body seems to be stressed out by the effect it has on my body. I always look tired and vacant when taking it. However, I am very good at doing work in this state, and in my life I have struggled to get any where without relying on the medication and the side effects it gives me .   \n\n\nI also find that it affects my personality and sociability negatively, I lose interest in people and all forms of casual conversation when I'm on it. I have been on and off of vyvanse, adderall, concerta, ritalin, stratera, and out of those Vyvanse/Adderall are the only ones that work in a measurable way.   \n\n\nIt leaves me feeling like I have to find a career where I deal with people as my personality caters to it heavily when unmedicated. However, the issue is that when it's time to work my disability will always show up in jobs where socializing/people aren't an element.   \n\n\nHas anyone else had a medication dilemma like this, what else should I try? I have been on doses ranging from 10mg-60mg (where I am now).",

Pre-medication, I picture a couple of trains each representing an obsession of the week or hobby hurling along the tracks through my brain. There’s a gate in my brain the train has to enter through, and it’s very narrow so the train fills up the entire space. As a result, I’m not able to do much else. I’m a prisoner to this obsession.\n\nPost-medication has been quite interesting. To keep in the same theme as above with the trains, this time I just built a Japanese bullet train network in my mind. All of a sudden, I want to do everything at full capacity all at once. Complete obsession about home improvement projects, spring cleaning, building better life habits, doing XYZ at work, etc etc. It’s non-stop. My capacity certainly has broadened itself significantly, but it’s getting to a tipping point where I’m afraid I’m becoming paralyzed with just trying to do too much. Literally can’t stop obsessing over everything. \n\nOn the positive side, I’m SUPER on top of stuff at work and home. Way more than ever. I am much more focused and able to prioritize at work, but I’m still having to fight the bullet trains flying through my head. I guess this is just the way it is.",

        "text": "Grief. Recently diagnosed.\n\nI was diagnosed a little over a month ago. It's been a rollercoaster for me. I've been so relieved to know the underlying cause of several issues in my life. I've been going to therapy, recently started medication, and overall been making changes to improve my life. Today was not a great example of that. \n\nI had an appointment with a CPA to do taxes with my wife. I've never been a numbers guy, and being self-employed, it's always felt like an insurmountable, confusing task to do track income, expenses, and then file taxes. So we went to a CPA. I found myself immediately unable to focus, unable to do much of anything besides stare at the window. My wife was answering questions addressed to me before I registered them as something to engage with. I owe a lot of money (which I expected) and when we got home my wife immediately wanted to figure out where I was pulling the money from to pay them. I once again was unable to be attentive, and think through any response, or think about suggestions my wife put forward. I tried to tell her that I wasn't able to focus the way I wanted to, I kept getting confused, and wanted to do this at another time. She said if I could just focus for like 2 minutes it would be over with. And she's right, but I just couldn't. \n\nI've spent the rest of the night feeling a loss for the person that I thought I was. I've had to relearn so many things about myself since being diagnosed that I feel like I'm questioning everything about myself. I've seen all the missed signs that I have ADHD. I've been keenly aware of my inability to focus. I've tamped myself down when I feel I'm hyper focused or hyperactive. My self confidence has taken a dive, and it feels like it'll be a while before it comes back. I thought diagnosis would be the start of much happier and easier times, and while I do think that in the long run, I didn't expect this emotional difficulty right out of the gate.\n\nTL;DR-Diagnosis changed the way I see myself and my actions. I feel like I'm grieving the loss of my old perception.",

I'm entirely aware that my mood and task performance suck when I'm hungry, but I still haven't quite figured out what works for me.

I've tried being realistic with grocery shopping (limiting to the basics so I don't waste food and money, that way I'm not so far over my food budget, but still, to get fast food I have to go through the motions to get myself out the door). I'm not the best at cooking and even simple box meals or frozen foods feel like a scary task for me (dishes, delayed gratification, sensory issues/\"safe\" foods suddenly not being safe anymore, etc.) What are some things you all have tried?",

        "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about what my counselor said, she said I might have ADHD. And it feels like the more I research on these type of things, the mor I start noticing how accurate these descriptions and symptoms are for me. And I know I have to get diagnosed by a professional so I don't think i have ADHD, but I really believe it has to be SOMETHING because I’ve struggled with eveyrthing in school ever since I was like 4 years old. \n\n I’m tired of hearing that I have “potential”. Cuz then why can’t I reach it. Why is it that my teachers say I’m so bright but I can never fulfill their expectations. Why is it that no matter how hard I try in school I can’t get higher grades. Why can’t I ever focus on one assignment and then I get mad at myself when I know it was my fault for not paying attention. I don’t get it, I don’t think I ever will and I’m just begging to see a psychiatrist to be checked out cuz either I’m going insane or I really do have something.\n\nI was always told I was so loud, so annoying, I kept talking too much. I always used to get out of my seat and walk around the class cuz I just couldn't stand it. So I tried stopping, I don't get out of my seat but now all I do is draw on mypapers. Hell, onelook at my chemistry books and you wouldn't even think it was for school. I stopped talking loudly, and now everyone asks me to raise my voice cuz I'm so quiet. I was told to stop talking so much,so now I pace around in my bathroom and in my room just talking to myself . Not like \"oh hey i can't believe i ate that yesteday\" but I would literally strike a conversation with someone that didn't even exist. Actually I think im just crazy for that one lmao\n\nAs my teachers became more disappointed in me, so did my parents. It made me so frustrated, I would never cry about it but I just hated how I was. I wanted to do better, but it just didn't work. Especially when we started division. HOW THE HELL DID EVERYONE GET THIS?? we were learning multiplication like YESTERDAY nad now WE'REDOINGLONG VDIVISON??\n\nI was so lost. I never understood, and after that math felt impossible. I hated the subjectmore and more and now, in 11th grade, I can't stand it. I don't care about going to college, IN FACT I forgot that you're supposed to start getting your future together andplanned in 11TH GRADE... WHAT THE HECK?? Why don't I have more time. I'm not ready. but then again, I don't carea bou tmy grades (in fact i'mfailing all 8 of my classes right now with 50 and below) and I don't care what people think. I know i'm a dissapointment. I get it already. What do they want me to do. \"focus\" HOW?? \"pay attention\" BUT WHY?? EVERYTHING IS SO BORING. Then again I have literally 1 friend. I should have socialized more andtalkedto people more and actually kept in touch with people.Cuz nowit's my fault that I don't have any friends. \n\nThe more I type the more i realize these things are probably in mycontrol, i'm just not applying myself orlike not trying hard enough. I should stop saying \"hoowww whyy\" cuz everyone else can do it fine. they struggle too, what makes me that much different besides me complaining about it like a kid throwing a fit. Maybe I do have adhd, but my cousin has it too yet he still gets the math done. Am I just depressed? Am I actually really lazy and just thinking I have adhd cuz i want an excuse for my laziness?? Goodness, I might be a terrible person.\n\n  If it turns out o have NOTHING wrong with my brain then I just don’t even know anymore cuz eeff all of this. It’s just so frustrating. \n\nmy friends tell me to go to school and worry more and I know how bad it is but I just can’t do it and it makes me want to give up on everything, not because I can’t do it, but because everyone thinks I can and just need to try harder. How much harder do I have to try.",

My psychiatrist told me the results very vaguely (“Possible ADHD due to issues with executive dysfunction”), but wouldn’t actually give me a copy of the report. My new psychologist tried to get access to it, but wasn’t allowed.\n\nSo finally today, I got the report, and it says that I do, in fact, have ADHD. I don’t know why no one couldn’t have just told me that anytime in the last 6-7 months, but at least I finally know.\n\nI’m definitely not hyperactive, but I guess ADD is now just considered a part of ADHD? Regardless, it certainly explains a lot about the issues that I have, and I have one more condition to add to the list.\n\nAnyways, hi everyone!",

        "text": "I would like to know if anyone has lived something similar or is aware of such a thing :\n\nI have been taking Vyvanse since June. I started at 10mg and moved up to 20mg in october because I could barely see any difference and couldn't tell if I was trying to persuade myself that it did help or if did actually do something small. \n\nHowever, I am still experiencing the same thing with 20mg : sometimes I think that it does help, but only in the slightest, and the next minute I'm convinced it's not doing anything for me. \n\nI suffer from anxiety and I am often paranoid that things aren't real/are a lie/scheme. So I sometimes reach the point where I think that the doctors gave me a placebo. I know that it is irrational to think this, but I do really get to that point of questioning if it could even work at the start.\n\nI looked up the standard dose and found out that 30mg is pretty much the starting dose. However, I am under 18, so I wonder if that might be the reason of such a \"small\" dosage/why my doctor started at 10mg.\n\nPlease don't scream at me for the next informations :\n\nI know that you shouldn't stop medication abruptly or take more that what is prescribed, but I have done both and I saw no difference between not taking the meds (sometimes for a couple of days and sometimes for only one day) and taking 20mg.\n\nHowever, I did see a difference the first time or two that I took double the dose (40mg) (I wanted to know if it would change anything) but when I repeated the experience, I once again did not feel any different than without the medication. I wonder if I tricked myself into believing that it worked the first time(s) or if there was actually a difference and there still is but I can only perceive it through certain tasks. \n\nI also wonder if I'm not the issue, maybe there is a remarkable difference but I am simply unable to notice it because I am not focused on my ability (or non ability) to focus and other symptoms.\n\nI am aware of the shortage, but I believe that it started more recently than June. Maybe it still has to do something with my experience, like 10mg wasn't enough and then 20mg might help but the shortage hit around that time so it really isn't 20mg but a lower dose (?) I am lost in all of this. (Take note that I live in Canada and that I am unsure of whether the shortage is hitting here too)\n\nAs I stated before, I have severe anxiety. I also hate speaking to doctors, it is also hard to get an appointment. So I am to scared of explain this to her, it doesn't help that I can only get phone appointments of 15 minutes, which stresses me out even more and where I feel like what I have to say is unimportant and that a solution must be reached as quickly as possible, under the 15 minutes. \n\nI would like to know if you think that it is a dosage problem or if it is the type of medication that causes this issue. I would also like advice on what I could try and on what points I could bring up with my doctor, take note that it will at beast be in a month because of the appointment delays, and how to explain this to her. Knowing that I last told her that the medication worked slightly, hence why I got a higher dose and am now unsure of if the medication ever worked. \n\nI am sorry for the disorganization of this post, please take note that English isn't my first language and that I am deeply confused as to what to do.",

I got on access. \n\nGot jew job that I love, suddenly everything was looking up and then something weird happened. I kind of had a mental breakdown. Essentially, once I was in a safe place, a bunch of repressed memories returned and I essentially learned I have a dissociative disorder alongside ADHD. So while on the outside everything is great, on the inside, everything is a nightmare (because I was reliving one). \n\nAnyhow, the whole time this is going on, I have a month to enroll and whenever I try to, I can't find a link anywhere. I notice that my benefits tab says \"waived\" and mention it to my new stressed out boss who's just trying to push a crap load of training into me, and she doesn't really hear me and mentions something really vague like I can sign up whenever, and continues training me. So I get the impression I have some cushion, and out it aside because this job involves extremely busy work, extreme info dumps in the training, and I'm managing that with both ADHD and traumatic childhood memories returning. Oh and no reminders about signing up for enrollment btw, other than for retirement. \n\nThen last week I get a panicked feeling and remember I still haven't signed up for my benefits, so I check it out again and this time firmly ask my boss about it. She finally notices it's weird and contacts our hr person who then says I've missed the enrollment date and will now miss it for another year.\n\nCue in me having a full on crying rage (alone, quietly, in my office). I don't know what to do now. The state will not give a fuck. But I never had a chance anyway because for some reason I was waived from the get go? I don't know what to do and my brother is freaking me out, saying I probably won't qualify for ACA now (in the states). I feel so hopeless and all the reddit posts I see about this are just chastising the shit out of the people who mess up and it makes me hate myself even more.",

        "text": "I am seeking advice because I struggle with eating or eating thru out the day. This is one of the toughest things about ADHD for me and I tried so many things but I end up nauseous every time. Is there any snacks that keep you guys full in between meals? I usually eat one meal a day because its so hard to eat. Any advice about helping me with my eating will be appreciated!!! Also I understand our meds play a huge factor in eating!!",
