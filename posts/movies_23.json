        "text": "After watching the Highlender: Search for Vengeance Anime for the umpteenth time (yes, there's an anime movie, go watch it!) I've just had very curious thought that after so many action films since Blade and since the MCU stuff, we could do an honest to god superhuman level Highlander movie.\n\nI mean, it's not an original thought, but Highlander is in need of a reboot, what I love about the Anime is that it is distinct in story from the Original, instead of just going through time fighting his own or even befriending some Immortals, we see a villain who doesn't just want to win the Prize, but actually has his own dreams and I like the Kurgan is not a Barbarian (which I think was done on purpose), while the protagonist is very one note. But where both films are similar is how the main characters reflect each other.\n\nI have no idea why we haven't had a new movie yet (I'm sure YouTube can answer that) but we could have a good Duology or trilogy. Not sure who I'd cast, I uses to watch the TV show as a kid (not the cartoon much, but I saw a few episodes on TV years back.). And there's a lot that can be explored, the Anime showed magic or Mysticism genuinely exists, the original movie shows Immortals can feel the life force of others or nature.\n\nThere can't only be one! (good live action Highlander movie)",

        "text": " \n\nTime travel is tricky stuff. It twists your melon – man; especially when you're trying to deal with actual quantum physics and not just that cutesy Grandfather paradox/alternate timeline junk that they sell you in films and on TV. As Nobody (Arioni) in Federico J Arioni's film *Nobody Is Crazy/Nadie Esta Loco* is fond of quoting from Ecclesiastes: “What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun.” And this, believe it or not, actually helps make things a lot easier to understand.\n\nNobody's (and Ecclesiastes') point is that nothing can be changed. Through past, present and future, all that has been, is, or will ever be is already set, with no heroic time-traveller or fancy chronometric shenanigans being able to alter that. It's probably best to keep that in mind as you delve into the plot of *Nobody Is Crazy* and the life of its main character Rafael.\n\nRafael (Gutierrez) is a lonely 16 year old boy living in Neuquen, Argentina. He has OCD which keeps his systems rigid and his social circle non-existent. His mother is at her wit's end trying to get him to go to school and engage with other children his age, which has led her to threaten him with being sent to military school. Rafael's psychologist, the latest in a long line, can't seem to get through to him either, and as a last ditch attempt suggests a therapy group that meets three times a week where he can listen and not engage if he doesn't want to. Naturally, this is where things start to go awry.\n\nOutside of the group one day, Rafael meets an enigmatic stranger in a black eye-mask and gloves. This oddball calls himself Nobody and professes to be a time-traveller; a skill which he says ultimately he can't control. For the first time in a long time Rafael's curiosity is piqued and the two form a friendship of sorts, based mostly on Rafael's need to uncover this other so-called crazy person's lies.\n\nWhat follows is an exploration of the theory and plausibility of time travel through intense dialectics. Nobody acts as the perfect foil to Rafael with his upbeat attitude and alternative viewpoints on the world. His mask keeps him mysterious and strangely believable as a time-traveller whilst at the same time marking him out as a kook and a fantasist. This split dynamic keeps Rafael interested long enough to lose some of his inhibitions about being around people and places while he investigates who on Earth Nobody is. Then when a girl, Daria (Wheeler) is introduced into the mix, things get taken up a notch and Rafael finally gets serious about what kind of a person he wants to be in future.\n\nArioni's film is throughout a clever mix of coming of age story and time-travelling mind f\\*\\*\\*. The characters are extremely well drawn and just off-kilter enough to keep the audience guessing as to who they are behind their ego, or their psychoses, or their mask (literal or metaphorical). The direction and cinematography play their part nicely, shifting between close-ups and wide shots as the dialogue takes the characters into newer and more varied spaces.\n\nThe dialogue itself can run at breakneck speed, with the first twenty minutes in particular being difficult to follow as there's so much to read in the subtitles that it can be hard to find time to see what's happening on screen. After that though, things settle down and then all you have to deal with is the science and philosophy of quantum mechanics. Simples.\n\nThe actors are natural and engaging in their roles with Arioli in particular pulling off a fine job behind the mask as the enigmatic Nobody. Adding to the feel of all of this are the nice 80's references which Nobody brings along with him and the excellent placement of the music, both songs and score.\n\nThere are some really nice nods to other time travel movies all the way through the film and spacetime geeks will have a field day finding all the references littered around. There is also a fun *Ferris Bueller* scene in an art gallery but overall *Nobody Is Crazy* feels most akin to *Vanilla Sky* (2001) or more accurately its Spanish predecessor *Abre Los Ojos* (1997), with its mind bending dialogue and references and its solipsism (I had to look it up).\n\nOverall *Nobody Is Crazy/Nadie Esta Loco* is a fun ride with some truly unique characters who are ready to walk and talk and time travel all at the same time.\n\n \n\n##### William Hemingway\n\n[https://www.ukfilmreview.co.uk/reviews/nobody-is-crazy](https://www.ukfilmreview.co.uk/reviews/nobody-is-crazy)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wrk0rw9f5zma1.jpg?width=2067&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=09f0fa26d89d3c15434c7890600d7d1a21d20eea",

Seagal fans that have been  through his lazily shot dtv movies which have ranged from boring, downright garbage to almost unwatchable-Urban Justice comes as more than just a breath of fresh air. This film is a throwback to the days when a Seagal film would spit out wanton violence for the pure sake of it; needless blood and gore simply because it could and Seagal beating people up with no mercy at all. Yes this is the film every Seagal has been waiting for, if you disliked the relatively toned down theatrics of Exit Wounds and Half past Dead and were disappointed by the glimpses of past glory in Into the Sun and Belly of the beast, then Urban justice is that remedy . Eddie Griffin nailed it as the villain Btw . Loved every bit of his acting in it",

The whole movie could be about how to let go after losing a parent.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's lame but I think I would enjoy this. Plus it would be nice to see a comeback for Haley Joel Osment.

It’s possible it’s a tv show but we were both leaning more toward film. \n\nAny ideas?",

Yet nothing even comes close to the agony and emotional torture I felt while just LISTENING to what THC was about.\n\nSo which is your pick?",
