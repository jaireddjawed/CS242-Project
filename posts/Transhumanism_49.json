How is your version of transhumanist utopia? is it the same answer of the first question?\n\n3. In the political sense: how do you think we can, as human race, achieve this transhuman state: by some spontaneous way (in the liberalism sense) or by decisions made by world leaders?\n\nAnd finally:\n\n4. what do you think are the most positive ways in which we are actually improving our human characteristics? \n\nI'm really looking forward to read your answers.",

Do you think we could mimic that with some sort of electric signal, to reduce injury in a catastrophic event?",

For example, if they reach an intelligence that would enable them to be considered sentient, in my opinion, it would be *wrong* to delete them.\n\nEthics and morality is a huge topic, and I feel a subset of it regarding artificial intelligence would usher in a lot of new interesting ideas and theories.

I would like to recruit a team to work with me to build a neural scanner with an opensource OS, that would allow users to do everything that Neurowear has done, and more. There is a [team](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/openbci/openbci-an-open-source-brain-computer-interface-fo) that has done something similar, but for research purposes. I want to make a consumer product, that is fully customizable, and available to everyone.\n\nFrom displaying your emotion, to connecting to your computer, to sending texts, to playing games. One could even use it to do research, however the main focus would be for utility and entertainment. \n\nI am posting here because I have never started a project like this before, and I am unfamiliar with the hoops. I'm not even qualified to do any of the work, I have little experience with programming, and I'm a complete n00b when it comes to neuroscience. I simply want to get it done, and I am willing to learn while the ball is rolling. Can you help me Reddit? Can we do this, together?\n\nSuggestions on where to get started, as well as people who want to get on board, are welcome. ",

Keep regular backups and run the most recent one when someone dies? Is it okay to delete mind copies that have never been run? Is it okay to keep a mind copy without running it? Upload ourselves and then go on living - is that copy running at the same time really 'you' in a significant way? Or would we just restrict it to the terminally ill?",

If you've read the Chinese Room argument you'll know why. Even if I could upload my consciousness it would be a copy and I'm fairly certain of that, since if I weren't destroyed in the process I would definitely be in the same body having the same awareness. \n\nThere is a lot of progress with prosthetics and synthetic organs, but all that surgery is very very invasive.  If you lived forever, eventually anesthetics would fail, if not the surgery itself. You just can't be conscious when that stuff is going on.\n\nOn the other hand, nanobots could be injected in one of the little syringes that nurses use on babies to get their measles shots and such and be programmed to go painlessly anywhere in the body. They could edit our DNA, give us telomerase, kill cancer, repair organs, etc.  There is already a lot of progress in this area, but not nearly enough for what we need.\n\nSo, if you have money, give it to nanotechnology. I don't see any other reasonable way to live forever. Remember, staying alive is our #1 goal, there's no point in space travel and such things if we won't be here to see it...",

        "text": "Our primary focus in transhumanism _must_ be nanotechnology.  Here's why:\n\nWe don't know if consciousness uploading works, nor will we ever.  AI is definitely a good thing, but we don't know if it's conscious either.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room\n\nDo you really want to have to go through invasive surgeries and risk having the anesthetics fail when you're getting your prosthetics? I don't.  With all the current medical progress with prosthetics and synthetic biology, it already looks like we could live forever if we hold on a couple more decades, but not very comfortably, to say the least. With nanotechnology we'd only have to get little shots like babies do at the doctor's office to get some respirocytes in our blood stream, or to target cancer cells, have little bots repair our organs, clear blood clots, whatever.  Prosthetics hearts and brain prosthetics wouldn't even necessary for people who don't want them.\n\nNanotechnology could function to cure many illnesses within five years, and if we put more money and work into it, it could repair our bodies or, even better, modify our genes so our bodies heal themselves in a couple of decades.  There are mice that can heal up because they are missing some genes.  The nanobots could also do things like increase our telomere lengths to fight aging better.\n\nNanotechnology is the only reliable way that I can see to have a \"Ship of Theseus\" consciousness transfer. Our brains are growing neurons and losing them all the time, so having a few neuron nanobots in there at a time probably wouldn't hurt. In fact, one probably would not even have to go all the way. \n\nSo why is AI emphasized more than nanotechnology you? I don't see a single more important thing any of us could be doing right now than working on it, funding it, or advocating it. It's our safest bet.",

        "text": "Transhumanism could have happened centries ago if it weren't for religion. Most people today in the US are still religious, and argue morbid arguments that death is inevitable and we're all going through heaven anyways so we should be OK, and are just afraid of prosthetics and bioengineering and such things that help people live longer and better lives. People think everything is OK, so they just focus on useless consumerism, when everything is absolutely not OK. We just need more things to get religious people into transhumanism, since one can fit literally anything into religion. I imagine that will be easier than trying to fight religion, especially since not all people without religions are transhumanist. If you can think of any arguments, post them here, and please try to get people into transhumanism.",
