It seems like a great way to get even more tender beef, and [more carrot-y carrots](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/how-to-sous-vide-carrots-vegetables.html). But Kenji has advised that more onion-y onions are [too much](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/08/sous-vide-your-way-to-the-best-corn-food-lab.html), so they would have to be done per the original recipe, and I'm assuming sous vide mushrooms are just dumb. \n\n* Would the mushrooms and onions lose something by not having the carrots sauteed along with them? Could that be made up by adding the carrots' sous vide juices?\n* Would adding the sous vide juices from the beef work as well in flavoring the broth as having the actual beef in there during stewing? \n* Would the beef be as flavorful if added late in the \"stewing\" process, or would it not seem to have taken on the flavors of the stew? \n* Could I (should I) stew the \"disposable\" vegetables for much longer (for more flavor) if I weren't worried about over-stewing the meat?\n\nI can't really afford (in time or in ingredients) to do a bunch of test runs, so I'm wondering what people think, or better yet, if they've tried it.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Which to me is amazing because I'm using a pan that is an inch or two bigger than what Kenji recommends, so the dough is actually thinner, and I cook it longer than the 10 minutes the recipe suggests. I usually end up cooking for 20 at 550.\n\nPossibly it has to do with me using the 24 hour version of the dough? I don't know. My original thought was the dough stays soggy because of either too much sauce or too much oil, so I've reduced how much of each I've used. I'm coming up with nothing. Still an undercooked middle and incredibly crispy edges.\n\nIt's excellent the next day though, even better. I take the left overs and reheat them in a cast iron pan with a lid and the entire thing ends up cooking through that way. \n\nKind of crazy that it takes 3 days of work though to get some perfect pizza. Good things come to those who wait, I guess.",

We just don't really have it here (socialist crappy happy Denmark) - So, I figured, that I'd give Kenji's recipe a go, to try all-american mac 'n' cheese!\nThe issue I'm running into is that no stores I've been to in DK carry evaporated milk. I can easily find sweetened condensed milk, but I'm guessing that a caramel-flavour isn't what I'm looking for in mac 'n' cheese (See, I've never tried it, so I wouldn't even know).\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to make your own evaporated milk? Currently (as in right now) I have a liter of milk in a pot, trying to simmer it down by approximately 60% - but if anyone has a better idea for a replacement, or an easier method of \"making your own\", or even if someone knows of a supermarket in Denmark who sells evaporated milk, I'd really love to hear it!\nAny advice is much appreciated!\nCheers",

The recipe was followed exactly but I may have beaten the initial mixture for 2 minutes rather than 30 seconds - would incorporating too much air cause them to spread? My work colleagues enjoyed my \"florentines\", at least!\n\nAnd now the blondies... the flavour is amazing, but the mixture is still gooey in the middle. This was especially pronounced with the gluten free version, but I'm not counting that as I used my parents oven so can't guarantee the temperature. The second version with regular flour is still overly moist/slightly gooey even after cooling.\n\nHas anyone made the blondies yet? Any issues? Should I just cook it for longer (I JUST saw that it says to cook to 210F, damnit)?\n\nFor reference I'm in NZ so ingredients are slightly different here.",

        "text": "Greetings, fellow readers/cooks! As a coastal Texan, I am about to experience some crazy rain this weekend (8-10 inches) and will be stuck in my apartment for the majority of it. I was thinking this would be a great time to try some labor intensive/time consuming recipes from the Serious Eats website. I have all the equipment in the world (sous vide included) so there are no limits on what I can make. I'd like to do 1-2 entrees and a dessert. Thank you in advance for your recommendations!\n\nPaging /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt \n\nUPDATE: I went grocery shopping last night (even at 9:30 p.m., the store was PACKED) and I will be making gyoza, chicken stock, black bean soup (from The Food Lab book), [tiramisu](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/06/best-tiramisu-recipe.html) (with [homemade lady fingers](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/06/homemade-lady-fingers.html)) and [horchata](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/02/horchata-drink-recipe.html).\n\nI know, I know. It is a very eclectic grouping of recipes but damnit, it's my weekend and I'll cook whatever the hell I want to! Thank you for all of your suggestions and help. Not only did I get ideas for this weekend, but many more to come. You guys rock!",

        "text": "Remember a few months ago when Kenji made [a list of his favorite hot sauces](http://www.seriouseats.com/2017/02/kenjis-favorite-hot-sauces-chili-pepper.html)? I've tried most of them and the one that led the list, Todd's Inner Beauty, was one of my favorites. (Now seems to be marketed simply as \"[Inner Beauty hot sauce](https://www.google.com/search?q=inner+beauty+hot+sauce&amp;tbm=shop)\" -- no Todd. Could swear my bottle from a few months ago said Todd on it.) But it's $10+shipping for a tiny bottle.\n\nI started poking around to see if anyone had a copycat recipe... lo and behold (and, oddly, not linked in the hot-sauce-list article), [Serious Eats put up the actual recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/2007/02/chris-schlesinger-gets-saucy.html) ten years ago! (Lead quote, from the guy who invented the recipe: \"I don't know why people buy hot sauce.... It's ridiculous when it's so easy to make yourself.\")\n\nHaven't made it yet, planning to make it this weekend -- but figured it might be helpful information here, at least so you can you find it from the search bar. Now I just have to find a pound of Scotch Bonnet peppers in the Pacific Northwest. (Internet says: \"don't bother, just use habaneros\"....)",
