        "text": "I was recently gifted 3-4 visa gift cards over the holidays from friends. It’s been a while since I’ve used gift cards, but I don’t recall having the major issues Im having now.\n\nOut of these 3-4 cards, I’ve only managed to use *some* of one of them. In total I have ~$350 altogether. I cannot use these cards, no matter what, unless they are being used in person. \n\nOnline transactions get denied 9/10 times, but I know these are funded and work because the cards are CHARGED and then declined. So I must wait 1-3 days to be able to use the card again.\n\nAs it turns out, I’m not the only one experiencing this problem post 2020. You can see the issue with major retailers here: https://forums.bestbuy.com/t5/BestBuy-com/E-Gift-Card-Order-Declined-But-Still-Got-Charged/td-p/1373152\n\nWhy is this happening, and why isn’t someone being held accountable/notifying customers? It’s $USD i’m barred from spending despite having it taken for confirmation. I’m one of many who are pissed off.",
