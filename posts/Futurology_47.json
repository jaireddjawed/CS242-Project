        "text": "First of all, I’d like to start by saying prayers to the people that were affected by the horrifying events in South Korea during Halloween, it truly was a frightening situation. After the disaster unfolded, the situation was incredibly tense in the country. The government was actively trying to silence all voices speaking out with regard to the tragedy that transpired on Halloween. This led many to claim that the problem wasn’t as big as it was made out to be, with the mentality of “just go to work and live your life” spreading like a disease, as if nothing happened. This was supposed to be the GOOD Korea, the democratic one, right? \n\nHowever, as practice demonstrated, there is no true freedom of speech, and democracy is just a tool for an elite majority to maintain power. \n\nWhy did I start this discussion? I went deep into the Korea crisis and ran into a project that created a communication channel for people in Korea to speak out without fear of prosecution, where people’s anonymous messages can be broadcasted without their identities being exposed, allowing them to express their thoughts and opinions without having to constantly look over their own shoulders. I feel like this may be a way for them to PR themselves on the back of the tragedy, though it does seem like a noble act (if we’re being naive). What are your thoughts on this? Do you see this as something that can be useful? Or is it just one more tool that can be abused? The idea itself is very honorable, but as we know, practice can differ greatly from theory. \n\nHere is where you can enter the message:\n\n20221212.kr\n\nHere is where you can view the  stream of the computer they have set up for message transmission:\n\nyoutube.com/@petitriot",

        "text": "AI winters refer to periods of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research and development. These periods often follow a period of hype and overhyping of the capabilities of AI, leading to disappointment when the technology fails to live up to expectations. This can lead to a reduction in funding for AI research, as investors and businesses become less interested in investing in the field. \n\nThe term \"AI winter\" was first coined in the 1980s to describe a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research following the failure of expert systems to live up to the hype of the time. Since then, there have been several other AI winters, each marked by a similar pattern of hype, disappointment, and reduced funding.   \n\n\nThe video I linked is a satire of how AI winters happen and it's easy to follow.",

        "text": "I asked chat.openai.com “What is Futurology” and got a solid, simple answer\n\n“Futurology, also known as future studies or futures studies, is the science of predicting and analyzing possible future events and trends. It is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of sociology, economics, politics, technology, and other disciplines to try to understand how different factors may shape the future.\n\nFuturologists use a variety of tools and methods to make predictions about the future, including trend analysis, scenario planning, and modeling. They may also rely on expert opinions and input from a range of sources, including academics, policymakers, industry leaders, and other experts.\n\nFuturology is often used to inform decision-making in a variety of contexts, including business, government, and civil society. It can also be used to stimulate creative thinking and help individuals and organizations to plan for and adapt to a rapidly changing world. However, it is important to note that futurology is not an exact science and that predictions about the future are always subject to uncertainty and change”\n\nI think this can be an important subreddit for discussing how to affect the future. I would like to advocate a discussion to stimulate creative thinking, and I would like to dissuade breathless optimism about new technologies. I find that within myself that style of optimism crowds out honest assessment about the role of humans within our ecosystem. This is complicated and we are all in this world together so I think we should try to have patience and empathy with one another, and true long term thinking means to me that we don’t have to get upset over specific details but instead I hope we can work on our directional beliefs.",

        "text": "The future cannot be thought of in the far future without taking a look into the near future with local problems. As previously found in this subreddit, there have been discussions in which the possibility of a bright future is put under the question. Ever since I thought of previous futurist works in which the elements of contemporary dystopia are challenged.\n\nBased on these findings I came to a conclusion that a bright future is possible for all of the globe and its inhabitants. I believe that it is possible to solve all of the current problems of the modern world in order to secure a prosperous future.\n\nAs of a result of such thinking, I created a subreddit: Project Borealia. In that subreddit I intend to explore the first steps to take towards building a prosperous future. The thesis of Project Borealia believes that it is possible to create:\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Hunger**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Food Waste**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Homelessness**\n\n**A World In Which There Are No Empty Houses**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Social Stratification**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Oppression**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Hate**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Violence**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Crime**\n\n**A World In Which There Are No Riots**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No War**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Poverty**\n\n**A World In Which There Are No Borders**\n\n**A World In Which There Are No Drugs**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Suicide**\n\n**A World In Which There Is No Dystopia**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProject Borealia believes that the ideas listed above are not a product of fiction. It is a possibility.\n\nDo you believe that such a project has the potential to achieve change or are there any concerns?",
