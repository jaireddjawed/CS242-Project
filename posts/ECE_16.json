Or does this not really matter because it is a perfect symmetrical device and the arrow is just there to indicate which terminal to use as source? \n\n2) Could we use the same circuit as a demux one? Just have Z as the input and A/B as the outputs. In this case could we use bidirectional inout pins? \n\n",

Probably the most disturbing part of this is that I also feel like I haven't learned very much through my classes or extracurricular projects, something that I realized during my first technical interview when I was asked \"what challenges did you face in your projects?\" and all I could say was \"uhh... looking things up on stackexchange?\" \n\nThe point is that I am stuck in a rut, and I have no idea how to move forward. Power systems, dsp, machine learning, software engineering, and controls all seem very interesting to me, but I don't have nearly enough specialized experience in any of these areas for employment to be a certainty.

However, after I restart the board several times eventually it does broadcast and then functions normally. \n\nSo far my testing rig is::\n\n- Development laptop connected to a router using a python UDP socket to chuck data at the board\n\n- STM32F2 connected to the same router which starts a netif attached to a static IP, pointing at the same gateway and has the same network mask as the development laptop\n\n- Console for monitoring returned data as well as Wireshark displaying the packets that have passed back and forth between the computer and the router.\n\nOn the STM32F2:\nI create the upcb struct for managing the udp socket in the lwip.c file and bind it to a local port before calling the udp_connect function to connect it to the socket on my laptop which is throwing data at it. I also use the MX_LWIP_Process() function for sorting data into the right bins for the LWIP stack.\n\n\nI've tested the NETCONN API example that comes with the STM32F2 on the board and it works absolutely fine. I also repeated the above test on an STM32F7 with the exact same results. Starts up and then needs to be reset several times before it works. \n\nI looked through the ST Community pages and found a few references to this problem, but no solutions!\n \nI've posted the question on Stack Overflow as well, but I was wondering if someone might have an insight. \n\nYou can see the question with the code included here: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/383969/lwip-raw-udp-api-on-stm32f2-f7-generated-by-cubemx-not-sending-on-startup-requi  \n\nAny and all help would be greatly recommended.

        "text": "When designing an architecture, I often find that the first step in doing so is drawing a schematic of the circuit. These schematics usually tend to be fairly detailed, down to the level of multiplexers/FSMs/adders, etc. This usually doesn't take too long, and we're able to quickly come up with several possible architectures and assess possible advantages/disadvantages.\n\nOnce this is done, we begin implementing the chosen architecture in a HDL. This always proves to be extremely tedious and annoying. Many bugs pop up, often the code doesn't translate into the circuit you have in mind because of a stupid mistake, and Verilog just isn't as intuitive as a schematic.\n\nSo why do this? Why isn't it more standard to just draw the schematic into the IDE and have it translate it into a bitstream for you? I know graphical tools *exist* but I've never heard of them being used either in academia or industry. People have started using HLS to avoid the annoyingness of Verilog, but why not just *draw* the diagram instead?\n\nI think you would be able to achieve the same level of control as Verilog. You could insert FSMs using state diagrams and combinational logic using truth tables, but if you need even more precision, you could jump back down into Verilog to create portions of the circuit.\n\nSo why exactly isn't this more common?",

When i plugged it in my pc two partitions appeared: one 6.7GB and around 1.3 GB. The 1.3GB partition had ads about the company but the weird feature was that this partition could not be removed, formatted, or modified in any way.\nI took it apart to see if there was something special inside... well the controller was unconventional... it wasn't an Alcor,SM or any brand i recognize, it was simply a blob of black resin. \nAt this point it came to my mind to make my custom flash drive using an stm32 as a controller for the NAND flash and try to implement the same feature (Imagine adding a  protected partition for windows disk recovery etc..). I quickly realized that i needed some kind of a flash translation layer running on my stm32 that had wear levelling, bad block management and ECC but this is how far i was able to get.\nThis project will be a learning experience for me in handling NAND flash chip, interfacing them, and learning about how flash drives work in general.\nIf you have any resources that can help me progress in my project i would really appreciate it. Open source FTLs, ways of simulating a conventional usb flash controller on stm32, or any information regarding NAND flash interfacing.\nIt maybe more than i can chew, and may fail at the end but i am willing to put the time and effort.\nThank you.\n ",

Because communication from topside to devices dangled under water is difficult and expensive.  Umbilicals AKA tethers are horribly expensive, and so are their connectors.  I'm looking for a way to communicate with submerged equipment cheaply by using wire rope as a transmission line, preferably at 2.4GHz. \n\nThis doesn't replace umbilicals for every situation though, for example umbilicals typically also carry power in addition to comms, and I'm not considering this.\n\nI'm aware that OpenROV uses Cat5 cable as their tether.  This works for them because they do not put any mechanical load on their tether.\n\nDoes anyone know if something like this has been done before?  If not, does anyone have ideas on how to estimate the attenuation?  I realise the characteristic impedance will likely not be 50 ohms but I assume a transformer balun can be used.  Thanks guys!",

In Australia all students have to do this as part of their degree so hopefully that makes it a little bit easier than say the US where not everyone seems to have to do one. \n\nHowever my main question is this: how do I get it across that I suck at taking tests? If you look at my transcript I've got just above a credit average (and a maths fail - I believe due to the uni switch) which is alright but definitely not great. However when it comes to doing projects/assignment and not just memorising an entire semester's worth of content I have performed quite well and have a better understand of the work than some of my peers imo, this just doesn't really show on a transcript where roughly 70&amp;#37; of my final marks come from final exams.\n\nSo yeah that's me, I'm looking for any and all criticisms/advice you guys might have. Also whilst I'm here I may as well ask: does any computer/digital design happen in Australia besides FinTech?\n\n[Phone numbers and emails covered](https://i.redd.it/v0t4xnt10a711.png)",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI work at a smaller company doing a mix of firmware, hardware design, and a bit of embedded Linux programming.  I'm part of a relatively new team that was hired on about a year ago now for a large project, and this was after a flush of most of the previous team [orange flag here?  though one of my closer co workers who stayed through the whole thing says the last guys were kind of slackers].  This job has been going well for me, though it has been overwhelming sometimes to be responsible for and involved in so many parts of the project.  The plus side is I am getting some great experience in my first gig out of college.\n\nI periodically get reached out to by recruiters on LinkedIn looking to source talent for embedded engineer positions.  Sometimes, these look more exciting than the industry I am in now, but so far I have not followed up with any of them since I feel like I should put in some time where I am now.\n\nPros for potentially leaving for another job:\n\n* I know already that I won't be staying with my current company forever.  There are limited opportunities for advancement and the work will stagnate, though it is very busy right now.  I'm not even 100% confident we will be able to release what we are working on now, at least on schedule, because management expectations are very questionable - they don't seem to understand how ambitious some things they ask for are, and they get upset/worried when dates aren't met.  A team manager, who was also one of the strongest producers, was fired without warning \"for not delivering on product deadlines,\" but it was really due to a personal friction with his superior.\n\n* Although I have gotten a good % raise, I started well under industry standard pay and am still way under what a larger company would typically pay.  I'm not looking at everything in dollar signs, but the kind of pay increase I could have working somewhere else would pay off my student loans wayyy faster and get me on track to build my finances more quickly.\n\n* I could go work in an industry that is more exciting to me.  The fact that I currently get to wear several hats and learn a lot keeps things entertaining, but most of that will come to a halt once the current project is finished (or management gives up on the project, and/or the engineering team is cycled again :)\n\nCons of leaving:\n\n* I like the city I live in a lot.  It's beach side and pleasant, and it is unlikely I would find another job in my field where I live.  I would almost certainly have to move for another job, though it may be as close as a couple hours away.\n\n* Management doubts aside, I have a good casual work environment with people I love to work with.  While there is an almost manic sense of urgency that flows down management to my superior and myself, my boss is pretty good to work for.\n\nSo basically, I wonder how this sounds to you guys who can maybe speak to my situation.  It's not like I have anything lined up, and it's not like my current work situation is unpleasant or unproductive.  However, I'd hate for any of my doubts to wrongfully hold me back from pursuing any opportunities that could be a great professional and financial jump for me.  Thank you so much for any of your input.",

I am essentially following the \"typical use\" schematic from the data sheet with a couple modification to suit my case. That schematic is here: https://imgur.com/DUrEyec\nI am not an EE, I understand basics of DC circuits but this is my first venture into having a PCB made so I am learning along the way. It leaves me with a lot of questions.\n1) Most of the passives are fully defined. There are some capacitors that don't list a voltage and some resistors that don't list a power rating. In those cases what should I be specifying for those components? Looking at the schematic it looks like all of the passives that handle power are the ones with defined voltages and power ratings and the remaining are all control circuits and have minimal requirements. Am I far off? 2)There are 2 inductors in this circuit that have the set of double lines in the symbol. From my searching it appears there are many types of inductors. What type of inductor is this design most likely calling for? 3)Those 2 inductors only give the inductance as 10uH and 33uH, when shopping on a site like digikey there are thousands of results that range from 5mA to 5A as well as every other parameter you could imagine. How can I narrow down some of those parameters to make sure I'm specifying the right size/type of components?\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide! Addison",

        "text": "I'm making a gyro mouse using MPU6050, NRF24L01+ connected to STM32F103 board, all soldered to a strip-board. The STM32 reads the sensor and sends data via NRF24 to another NRF24 attached to a USB dongle (Arduino Leonardo). This dongle performs the Mouse commands. Currently I'm just using the yaw and pitch to control dx and dy commands.\n\nThe data sent (Yaw Pitch Roll) is stable only for a few minutes, even only a few seconds depends on how I move the board. After that the serial plotter showed the signals having random noise spikes among the correct data sent. During this time I could see that the mouse cursor is also slower, indicating lags in data stream. I observed that the further I move away from the USB dongle, the more likely this data stream become unstable. However this range would be unusually short, sometimes only 30-40cm is enough to cause this. Also the spikes almost always appeared after the first few packets loss. I suspect the NRF24 module might be at fault since I have the MPU6050's data printed out on STM32's USART and the plot had no spikes shown on the receiver side (see [figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FIF8F.png)).\n\nI used [Harinadha's](https://github.com/Harinadha/STM32_MPU6050lib.git) for MPU6050, as well as [LonelyWolf's](https://github.com/LonelyWolf/stm32/tree/master/nrf24l01) NRF24 library. To use the MPU6050's DMP feature, I adapted the well-known I2Cdevlib Arduino DMP library to work with STM32F10x. Both devices are configured to work with interrupts. I've tried adding decoupling cap (100uF electrolytic and 22nF ceramic) on the power pins of the RF module, changing RF channel, air data rate, transmit power and number/interval of retries to no avail. I've yet to try changing the module since it's hard soldered to the board.\n\nHere's the code I used for [TX](https://pastebin.com/P6AcHpNW) and [RX](https://pastebin.com/cSvRa56Z) devices.\n\n \n",

        "text": "Hi!\n\nI want to buy a [flow sensor](http://www.ultrasonicscn.com/Products/Ultrasonic-flow-meter/Economical-Wall-Mounted-Ultrasonic-Flow-Meter.html) for a personal project. It's my first time working with hardware (my background is in software) and all of this is very new to me. Specifically I need to read data from a 4-20mA output.\n\n[Parameters for the Flow Sensor](https://i.redd.it/hy7zg4ivgi611.png)\n\n1. Am I correct in saying that I need to connect an Analog to Digital converter (ADC) to be able to read the flow data (m\\^3/h)?\n\nI've done some research and found that I could do this [using an Arduino Uno](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-to-digital-conversion) or a [Raspberry pi with an ADC](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-analog-to-digital-converters/mcp3008).\n\nI can then access the data by connecting my computer to the Arduino or Rpi.  \n1a. If I want to access the data remotely, do I just need to connect the Arduino or Rpi with an ethernet cable or WiFi dongle?  \n2. Are there any other approaches than using an Arduino or Rpi?  \n3. Can I connect more than one sensor to the Arduino/Rpi, or is it 1:1?  \n4. Where does RS232/RS485 come in? Does the 4-20mA output need to be converted into RS485? or is RS485 a totally different output? How would one go about reading data from that? Same question with M-Bus and BACNet.\n\nThank you!",

During my geophysics tenure I became interested in signal processing. I went back to school with an eye on getting a PhD in DSP/remote sensing and trying to break into academia. My school, adviser and I never meshed, I was miserable and not making progress, so I took an MS consolation prize and left. Now I'm not really sure where to go from here.  \n\n\nAt this point I have a decade of programming in Matlab, on all sorts of applications (DSP, GIS, UI, algorithm development). I have my geophysics work; I picked up some antenna design, state space tracking and machine learning in grad school. I'm softly locked to the Pacific Northwest, so I've been looking at tech jobs like applications engineering or data science.  \n\n\nAre there other ECE related career paths that I may not have considered? Particularly ones where not having a BSEE isn't a big hurdle?",

I was wondering if there is a any way to identify which terminal is which using maybe a multimeter or another method? . I did tried googling but all the sensors I found have the usual color codes. I also tried all the posibilities and while some were of course wrong, some other gave me reasonable readings. I tried as well finding a datasheet but you know some sensors are knockoffs and the vendors (on ebay, amazon, etc.) Provide little to no official docs.\n\nAny light on the topic would be good. ",
