I've been struggling with wearing anything that's not workout leggings.\n They seem to smooth out my stomach and make me feel confident. Right now, I feel my size is about a 12-14. My issue is 12 is a little too small, and 14 is a little too big. For some god-awful reason, most women's jean companies only make sizes in even numbers, and I feel like a 13(if it existed) would be the perfect size for me. Only in a perfect world would women's jeans be more standardized in their sizing because one brands 12 is another brands 8 if you know what I mean. So ladies, what Jean brand makes you feel comfortable and confident? What would you recommend?",

        "text": "Long story short, I (38F) have started to realize that my parents, and especially my father, were emotionally neglectful to me.  It was like 50/50 growing up, and then got much worse when I went to college and then especially grad school.  I'm 38 now and I chose to officially go no-contact around June last year with my father (I still maintain limited contact with my mother, who does love me but is pushed around by my father).  I went no-contact because my father chose to ignore my wedding and left my mother to tell me, via text, at the deadline for each RSVP.  He didn't reach out the day of (mom did).  They did not attend and gave me only the reason \"travel is difficult right now\".  \n\nThere is a lot of reason I could give for being emotionally neglected by him.  Major ones include: putting me through major surgery in an extremely short timeframe with no emotional support, and it could have waited months later until summer; yelling at me to get out of the house when I visited after an internship and before going back to college; not attending piano recitals because he didn't like them; icing me out throughout my PhD because I wasn't done yet; not eating a meal my husband and I prepared for them on vacation (cooking used to be a bonding experience and is something I am proud of)...the list could go on and on. \n\nTo boot, he is an anti vaxxer and Trumper.  He is racist and sexist though he couches it in humor and charm.  I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh and I am only recently realizing how messed up that was.  \n\nThe backstory to this is that he did not attend my first wedding (my mom did).  Obviously I was divorced, which was very painful to go through, which my parents provided zero support on, and I am very grateful to have met my spouse.  I know now that my parents didn't approve of my ex husband, and they do approve of my husband (he is an amazing person!).   \n\nSo, I am done.  I have no interest in talking to him again, as a way of protecting myself.  My problem is, oddly enough, my husband.  He is in contact with my father.  I can't tell him who he can and cannot be friends with, but it definitely hurts me that my father chooses to talk to him and not to me.  My husband has a great and healthy family life, and he cannot understand what it was like for me.  I think my father talks to him because it's pleasant and there is no bad feeling.  To make it even more fun for me, my husband's parents do not speak much English and I don't speak much of their language (I am learning slowly, but it is hard when also working a full time job).  So I cannot interact with them at a deep level.\n\nI don't want my husband to suggest we visit my parents again (they live across the country).  I was uncomfortable taking a photo at Christmas to send them.  I don't want to know what he and my father talk about.  I don't want to know when they talk.  I want to heal, on my own, from a lifetime of not having a healthy relationship with my parents, especially my father.  I want to accept that my loving mother enables this, and move on from that, too.  \n\nSo, how do I handle this with my husband? What is and is not reasonable to ask? How do I communicate this?  We have excellent communication so I am not worried about having the conversation.  I just need help defining the points for myself, please.",

Crazy bad cramps while I bleed, horrible mood swings and raging anger that lingers for days, cystic breakouts on my chin, night sweats and absolutely no libido. Libido has been pretty much non existent for over a year now. I’m in a long term committed relationship so this has obviously caused some strain in that area. \nI have done research on the Depo shot and I will admit, I am pretty scared it try it. I’ve tried oral pills in the past and it didn’t work out for me, mood swings got worse. I also am not particularly fond of not having a bleed once a month as I feel (personally) it’s normal and healthy to have a monthly period. I don’t want to get an IUD as I feel that’s too invasive, and friends have shared horror stories regarding it as well. \nGuess what I’m asking for is just further advice and experiences regarding the Depo shot because I am so scared of the side effects.\nPlease and thank you!!\n\nTLDR; bad pms, been prescribed Depo shot but scared to try shot due to side effects.

I was confused and felt like we were too young for something so serious and both had some growing up to do. At the time I also had a lot of fear around relationships in general (something I've actively worked on since). He understandably, didn't take it very well and it led to a drift in our relationship. However, we got back in touch and have become closer again in the last 5 years. \n\nHe is a fantastic person. He is kind, considerate, intelligent and easy going. He is also a genuine friend and always looks out for those closest to him. We value the same things and I feel an incredible sense of peace when I'm with him and around him. Like I can absolutely be myself and can talk to him about anything. He is also hilarious and I feel really content even when just out for a walk with him. While I have always known that he is a wonderful person in the past few years or so I have started to develop stronger/romantic feelings for him and can't help but wonder what we would be like if we were to give it a shot now. \n\nI think I have made my interest clear in so much as I regularly invite him to do things 1:1 and in groups, call/message often, and have even seen him on dating apps (and swiped left, though we have never matched (which is a pretty clear sign he's not interested?)\n\nI knew in the past that he liked me, and could tell he did. The signs were obvious. Right now, I don't think he has those feelings for me anymore. But also since we've become closer again, we've never acknowledged how we used to feel about one another. I know this is my last chance to potentially say something to him and I feel like I may live in regret if I don't. But ALSO, he is such a lovely person and one of my closest friends, that I would hate if I lost our friendship because of my potential (one-sided!??) feelings.\n\nIf you were me, would you say something?

So when I hear people 40+ say, “I still feel inside like I did in my twenties,” I don’t get it. \n\nI wonder, do people actually feel this way, or are they misremembering how their twenties felt because some years have passed? Are they blurring together their twenties and thirties and mixing them into one category because it's been so long? (Like we might with the ages of 7 and 8.) Or are \"twenties\" a term to mean \"general youth\" and not the literal ages of 20-29?\n\nI read a study that said one's perceived sense of age tends to freeze in one's forties. This to me, makes sense. By 49, you've lived a chunk of Real Adulthood and have had time to bake into the adult version of yourself. But to still feel mentally in your twenties as an older adult is something I’m trying to understand. \n\nWomen 40+, do you feel like you’re still in your twenties inside? And if so, what does that feel like? I asked an older people subreddit this question, but the answers weren’t very self-analytical, and this sub tends to me more reflective.",

        "text": "I’m at a bit of a crossroad in life and would appreciate your advice on how to move forward. I’ll make this post as succinct as possible and will provide more information if needed in the comments. \n\n1. Work/career: 2 years in my current role. Pedantic manager who is very supportive but overall no long term prospects career wise. I’ve been applying for jobs but haven’t had any success. I’m starting to feel very irritated by my manager’s work style and think I’ve got about 6 months more left in me before exploding. I won’t explode but my patience is running thin so I’ve booked time off to just breathe. \n\n2. Relocation: Brexit! It’s made it so hard to move abroad and I’ve been trying so hard over the last few years. I recently got a call back after 1-2 years of applying and was rejected at final stage. I’ve been so sad since. All I want to do is pack my bags, move countries and start afresh. It’s been on my spirit for years to do this. \n\n3. Healing after a heartbreak: 1 year on after my ex cheated, lied, had a baby and married the girl (despite us meant to be doing the exact things) and his smear campaign on social media with so called friends I am starting to feel somewhat OK. Days like today I feel crappy because the betrayal was horrific. I don’t think I’ll be ready to date or anything for some time but I’m turning 30 soon. IDK, the betrayal really closed me off. I know I want a family of my own but I’m never going to compromise my peace or happiness again and feel very weary of men. I was so good to my ex and friends and it totally backfired. What they did and said should’ve made me go crazy but with prayer I decided to stay mute and leave it to God but the PAIN of not being able to defend yourself to outright lies, gossip and BS! He messed up but somehow it’s my fault. It’s like I want to take all the time in the world to heal but that may mean I’ll age myself out of “dating” or “child rearing” and there is a lot of pressure on me from family to marry / have kids. \n\nOther: I’m in therapy 1-2x a week. Being depressed I gained so much weight (60lbs+) as I stayed out of public for a year just crumbling. I’m on Ozempic steadily losing while walking as I hate the gym. It’s just not for me and I like running outdoors but there is no nature where I live. Moving out if an expensive option as everything is so expensive in London. It’s like £1500+ for a 1 bed as flat sharing is a no no for my mental health. I’m trying to save money after finally clearing my debt (yay) so I want to be smart about everything now as I’m getting older (insurance, pension, dental etc is all in order). It’s my savings I’m building back up now I’ve got some good boundaries in place with family leeches and not helping others beyond my means.\n\nI just don’t know the way forward! Everything seems blocked off and I feel very hopeless when I have so much to be grateful for. I want to level up, move forward in life but I just don’t know how! Any advice or ideas?\n\nI need a strategy!",

I specifically come to this site looking for examples of where things worked out and where things turned out okay and someone's dating efforts actually panned out (especially after lots of pain or feelings of hopelessness.) I sometimes look for years-old posts like this and then see what the user's been posting more recently to see if they did maybe eventually find a partner! (Sometimes they did and sometimes they're still dating years later which is scary to see.) \n\nWhat would you specifically tell someone to help them be optimistic and stick with it, given the effects of the pandemic, the effects of dating apps, how dating just changes in your 30s? 31F and have gone on 30 dates in the year since my last relationship ended.

        "text": "Would like advice on how to handle this situation.\n\nI have an ex best friend who I haven’t spoken to in a while since I ended the friendship 2020. We were friends for about 20 years, high school and beyond.\n\nI’ve sent her happy birthday texts which she’s acknowledged. I won’t be sending one to her this year (her birthday is at the end of the year). I don’t want nor do I have hopes for reconciliation (in the past or ever). \n\nHowever, I have a situation where there’s a photo she posted like 12 years ago to her FB profile. At the time, the photo was cool and funny but looking back on it, it hasn’t aged well at all. I’m the only one in the photo. \n\nI see it because I’m tagged in the photo (my tagged photos folder on fb) other than that I know she’s hidden her profile media. I know this because she did it while we were still friends. Lots of cringe pics from our partying days she didn’t want anyone to see. \n\nAnywho, I have to speak to her to get it deleted. I have no hopes in FB taking it down and she will know who reported it (me). I rather speak to her over the phone. I think that might doing to much and a text might suffice?\n\nI spoke to a mutual friend who knows about some of the reason why I ended the friendship but not the entire deal. I know my ex bestie didn’t tell this friend the entire reason why but gave a partial side of the story. This mutual friend can be really helpful with this type of thing  but became really cagey last time we spoke about it at lunch. As in, she either didn’t want to get involved or thought I was making a mountain out of a mole hill.\n\nShe told me that I should text her otherwise I might leave the door open to lead on the friend about a potential reconciliation. I expressed my concern that my ex-bestie might be vindictive and may not delete it if didn’t call to ask directly but this mutual friend definitely has her boundaries up which I respect. It’s a little old news for her.\n\nI just feel like an open ended text to the ex-bestie might leave room for her to ignore it. Really lost on what to do here.\n\nAny advice on how to approach my ex-bestie to get the photo deleted?",

In the past year, there are certain things I have noticed that just aren't adding up about her history, values, and character. The following things have given me pause:\n\n\\- Lying about previous jobs. For example, she used to work for a debt collection agency as a debt collector (I found out from a mutual friend who actually worked under her when she was his team leader) but she told me that she worked for a bank, \"helping people\" who couldn't pay back their loans. Mutual friend said this is a complete fabrication, that their team was calling up elderly people who were homeless and harrassing them for money THEY loaned to them in the first place. I don't know if she feels shame/embarrassment for working at a place like that - I mean, most of us have had shitty jobs in the past- but her need to lie about it is odd. She was also at this place for ten years.\n\n\\- For years, she lived off income protection after leaving the above role for undisclosed reasons. Mutual friends think this was premeditated and she was 'faking' the claims so to speak, particularly as the doctor signing the claims off was her uncle. She would often say she was sick but then be caught out in public going for brunches, shopping, etc.\n\n\\- Can be very self-righteous and pious (she is a Christian). She stopped talking to a friend who had two abortions because she thought she was being \"reckless.\" She is a big 'free speech' promoter and thinks Kanye should be allowed to say what he says, for example, but is quick to cut people off when she doesn't agree with their behaviour. Also, when we go out, she makes religious comments that can be annoying, for example, she will \"pray\" to God to find her a parking spot and then go on about how God \"looked down on her with favour\" when she finds a spot. Last time I challenged her on this (God prioritises your car spot over starving children?) and she got a bit annoyed.\n\n\\- Entitled attitude at times. For example, she stopped talking to her cousins as they didn't want to pick her up from the station after work a couple of times per week (because she didn't want to park her car at the station as her car was too expensive). She can be rude to customer service staff too.\n\n\\- Often cancels plan last minute, sometimes for no good reason. The last plans we had, she cancelled because \"she wasn't feeling upto it.\"\n\nThe confusing thing about all of the above is that she is very, very nice in person to me but hearing and seeing these things has given me pause.",

He was less open, hid his phone from me etc. but when he came to visit or visited things were great we were all over each other and happy. As time went his personality changed, he wasn’t as physical with me but was still very caring. This alarmed me and I was concerned he was cheating. He also became more nonchalant in personality. Qs is this why did he change? Was he trying to get me to break up? Or did the cheating change him? Also after I found out he cheated, he lied to me that he didn’t but he also did not fight for us to stay together….. this broke my heart. He called after the breakup and offered to buy me a new laptop since he was planning on doing so prior. I guess In this scenario idk if he ever loved me or if he regrets losing me idk. It just hurts because he is acting like he could care less. \n\nThanks for your input.",

        "text": "Two years ago my dad (70m) was diagnosed with stave iv cancer. A few months ago, I moved in to help him with keeping up the house/caring for his 4 pets/being there for him as needed since he was having trouble. And just so that people don't think I'm trying to take advantage of him: He didn't want rent, so instead I took over all the household bills. Internet, electricity, water, gas, groceries, pet care, etc.\n\nHe's doing mostly okay. He can still drive himself to chemo and will be up to putter about in the mornings, but the rest of the day is spent in bed. And there are more and more days where he isn't up to getting out of bed at all.\n\nThe thing is though that he doesn't think he's terminally ill. It's not that he's being stoic or optimistic. He really 100% thinks that he will get better. When he declares something, it becomes law and that's just the way things are regardless of any other circumstances. He also doesn't understand conversations with doctors or test results, so he wouldn't find out through that. He sort of blocks it out and then waits for the instructions part.\n\nAnd that's fine! If that's how he deals with things, then it's completely his business. I never, ever contradict him or allude to it being terminal. But from a medical perspective, it's definitely terminal and while they obviously can't say for sure, most likely within the year. The chemo is palliative rather than curative.\n\nThe problem though is that now I don't know how to handle or broach difficult subjects. Things like what he wants his end of life care to look like, what he wants done with his ashes, etc. I want to respect his wishes about not alluding to things being terminal, but eventually there's going to come a point where the talks can't wait any longer. \n\nWhat would be the best way to handle these topics? Is it better to talk about them or just leave it unsaid?",

After I paid the bill the three of us chatted about inflation a bit and my mum said '$130 is nothing really' and then my dad started to talk about how much he had to pay for my school fees over the years i.e. when i was in fee paying primary / secondary school from 4 - 18. It was boarding school, so i was only home at the weekends. Hes very self involved, has a lot of hangups and the older i get, i see hes just human so i try to overlook a lot of it but f\\*ck me, im only human and sometimes i feel like, what the hell is the point of me even trying. He drinks a LOT to cope with life. He had like 5 glasses of wine in less than an hour at dinner, and is slightly hammered all the time. I said im paying for dinner but you can get your wine, cause im not funding his alcoholism and he said 'i wouldnt have bothered coming then... and gave me a death stare. My mom then said hes joking and to 'relax' but he wasn't joking and even if he was, thats not funny. I'm 32 (nearly 33) , I feel like he treated me like shit my whole life. Now I'm older, why do i have to put up with this?\n\nGrowing up he sometimes would say to me how i didn't for him, nothing but take from him. Even when i was like 13 years old and couldn't work. He's a major asshole a lot of the time. I have taken care of myself my entire life and never ever asked for anthing. Aside from paying my school fees he and my mom gave me nothing. I was in a fee paying school with no money for anything outside of school and constantly got in thrown in my face by him. I didn't ask to me born. My mum just defends him the whole time and tells me to not make a deal out of anything as wants to keep the peace, her stress tolerance is low and her health is kind of shaky right now (which is another worry).\n\nI recently bought my own house, solo without any help from anyone lease of him from my family. My mum has never really been good with money to help me - which is fine - im naturally pretty good with it, so im fine. The past few years since moving up in work and making more money i have treated my parents to trips away (for them), family trips (for them and me), spa days for my mum to cheer her up, or voucher for hairdressers. Little things. I feel like I'm relatively generous. Tonight i said ill take us out to dinner. To get stuff thrown in my face yet again - it makes me feel so angry - like what am i bothering for??... im staying the night in their place tonight but i feel like leaving (i live a few hours away its kind of late to drive). \n\nI don't really know why I'm writing this post but i just feel so alone and angry. I'm single and its not straightforward for me to just cut him out because id feel strangely even more alone with no family, no partner and friends i dont get to see too much (due to being in my 30s and everyone (myself included) is busy with life.\n\nThank you for reading (if you lasted this far).",

We immediately hit it off again and began an official LDR in September.\n\nI've visited him several times since we began dating (and he's visited too--I just have more PTO than he does) and have fallen in love with where he lives. I moved to a new place and started a new job this fall and honestly don't like the location or the position.\n\nHe asked me in November what I was going to do when my contract ends this June. I told him that I'd like to move to where he is if we're still dating. He immediately said yes and had never waivered or shown hesitation about us moving in since.\n\nHOWEVER, I'm freaking out. I'm worried that he's just going along with this and doesn't really want me to move/to be with me. To be clear, there aren't any signs of that that I can see. My SO is pretty laid back, but he's always said he wants me to move out there and in with him. I've asked him if he really wants me to move in with him several times, and I think he's beginning to get (understandably) exasperated.\n\nHow do I get over this fear and anxiety?

We started dating 7 months ago, but she put off meeting me until last weekend. She routinely came up with excuses, or that she was too busy &amp; something came up. She has a 7 year old son, so I tried to be understanding of that, &amp; we kept it long-distance until she was free - though we were abundantly clear that it was a committed relationship. We texted all day, called every night.\n\nDuring this time of dating, before meeting, I discovered that she has been hospitalized in the past for self-harm &amp; placed in the psych ward. Her sister also committed suicide. So I was aware that she has some mental health struggles. She has a diagnosis for borderline personality disorder. Her previous relationship ended badly because she began screaming at the guy so much so that he began to also self-harm &amp; had to be hospitalized as well. \n\nNow, fast forward to this previous weekend when I finally met her. We spend the weekend together, everything goes pretty well, we're clicking decently, &amp; I ask her how she feels towards being in person &amp; if I look like my pictures, because I know meeting in person can be jarring. She comes across as very thrilled, happy, she's constantly touching me, cuddling me, laying her head on me, laughing &amp; smiling, holding my hand during a trip to the store. Everything is great for the most part aside from some general anxiety &amp; weird awkward moments. We have sex multiple times &amp; she was enthusiastic about it, even though that she didn't directly initiate it because of trauma from a previous relationship that she made clear to me - she always wants me to initiate it.\n\nThe final night we spend together, she receives a phone call while in bed laying next to me. It's a friend of hers, a guy, who demands to know where she's at, who's she's with. She says \"Now isn't a good time. I'm with someone. I'll talk to you later.\" - the guy doesn't stop &amp; begins getting progressively more upset, asking my name, how long she's known me, &amp; wanting her best friend's number so that he can text her. The call goes on for 10 minutes, &amp; eventually after her saying that she's on a date, they end the call with him saying that he wants to talk later in private. \n\nI ask her many details about why she feels the need to answer to him, &amp; why was he so flirtatious. She brushes it off as him being friendly &amp; that they've known each other for a while. We have a pretty heated argument, that lasts 2 hours. I stay calm, but she tries to brush it aside by saying that she knows how it looks, but it's not the case. We go to bed, &amp; I walk her to my front door the next morning. She tries to hug me, &amp; I tell her that I'll talk to her later. She turns back &amp; tells me that she loves me as she's walking down the steps.\n\nShe later texts me that day, going off on me, saying that I don't look like my pictures, that I edit them so heavily that she didn't even recognize me in person, &amp; that I'm not going to find anyone if I'm not genuine with them. So I explained to her that I've sent her videos on Snapchat, of my face, for months. Not to mention all of my pictures on Facebook &amp; Instagram. She clearly knew what I looked like, Snapchat filters or not. I've told her that I gained some weight during the pandemic &amp; wasn't as muscular as I used to be, even a slight receding hairline, but she knew that before coming &amp; told me that she doesn't care. Regardless, she says to me \"I know I caused a fair amount of damage with that phone call, but you need to understand what you did also wasn't okay. You didn't even hold me while I was crying, &amp; you were mad at me, rather than the situation. You've broken my trust &amp; I can't look past it.\" - so now, we've broken up &amp; removed each other. \n\nI've tried to call her, &amp; ask her to talk about it at least over the phone, but she refuses. I asked her if she felt this way, then why not say so in person because we could've had a better goodbye. She said \"I can't think clearly when I'm in front of you. I didn't even realize that I felt this way until I left. I love you so much, but sometimes that's not enough.\" She then admits to me that after thinking about it, that I'm right, &amp; that her friend probably does have feelings for her. She said all of her guy friends end up falling for her.\n\nI can't help but feel like she's deflecting the blame of that phone call onto me for something wild &amp; out of nowhere. If she was displeased, then why stay the entire weekend, have sex with me, &amp; pretend to be happy? Literally telling me how happy you are, &amp; how great everything is. She told me that she seethed with anger on the way home with how I got upset over the phone call. She said I had a right to be slightly mad about it, but not act like it was the end of the world.\n\n*tl;dr*\n\nmy girlfriend broke up with me for no reason &amp; I'm confused as fuck.",

It's been a decade, my life is better and I'm generally alright, but there are days and moments when the past catches up and i feel my old self spilling from the cracks.\n\n I'm honestly sick of it. It's been so long, i wish I can forget about it. There is no therapy here, but i did get pills for my depression (it's gone or in remission for 2 years). I wish i can stop flinching at any sudden movement or sound, or not strike out when someone jumps scare me. I wish i am not more than ready to cut people out if they try to control or interfere with my personal life, because it's more extreme than what's usually considered appropriate in my culture (and probably can be worked out with compromises and shit ton of communication, but idk, I'm tired of bs and i don't want to tolerate this anymore). I also wish i can stop avoiding men because someone repeatedly told me to use the guys for benefits, which turned me off dating completely because i DO NOT want to do that. I'm not that low! Which is why I'm a 31 virgin watching my best years flying pass. \n\nGod, there are many other ways that trauma interfere with my life, even now. I wish i can forget, i wish it never happened. And i sometimes wonder if it's actual, real trauma, because maybe i overreacted and it's really not a big deal? I was diagnosed, so at least that part is real, but my memory of that time is so fuzzy i can't really tell if it was so severe, or maybe i was being unreasonable? I guess it's hard to know because no one else was nearby during that time (i went abroad), so it's all he said she said between me and them haha. And they seem to not recognize anything was amiss with how they treated me, but well, i can see they're fucked up now that I'm away, so there is that. Idk, I'm usually alright, but some nights like tonight, i feel like screaming because look how that time fucked me up irreversibly. I dream of who i could have become, my potential, my joy, my old personality... all disrupted by it and the depression/anxiety following it. And the fun fact is, without the living situation, it could have been a life changing, uplifting experience living abroad. And yet. \n\nSorry for the vent, I'm quite emotional tonight. Anyone else in the same situation? I wish i can just shift delete my trauma haha, but then i did learn a lot of empathy and life experiences from it. I just wish the pain would be gone sometime like soon, that would be swell isn't it. I try to work through it myself cause therapy isn't a thing here, but i wonder if i really healed or just band-aiding it. It sucks.",

But I don't see what I should have achieved with that, or what the purpose of that should be?

        "text": "Hello everyone!  \nNot sure if I’m (29f) in the right place and it’s a bit of a long story but here goes..  \nMay 30th 2022, my father died. He and I had been living together in the house he owned ( my mom died in 2005 and my older brother moved out Feb. 2021). His bills (i.e. the mortgage, the electric bill, water bill, etc.) became my responsibility (on top of the bills I already had previous to his death).  To try and lessen the financial burden I was suddenly presented with, I asked my boyfriend (together 2 years at that time) to move in with me (June 2022). He’s been a huge help, up until recently. In September 2022, my best friend (16 years) broke up with her boyfriend (they were together 4 years I believe?) not long after she agreed to move to Maine with him (we all live in New Hampshire). She had literally no where else to go so naturally I invited her to move in with me and my boyfriend (they don’t like each other but, they’ve learned to get along for my sake). Here’s where things take a nose dive..  \nMy boyfriend (who had a good job) was recently fired (beginning of February) and so far hasn’t been able to find another job. My best friend works but she calls out ALOT and doesn’t really pay me rent or anything (she gives me $50 a week when she can which is MAYBE twice a month). So now I’m back to square one. When my father passed, he died without a will. I was appointed administrator of his estate. My brother and I have agreed to sell the house I’m currently living in with my two “roommates”.  My brother and I filed a “motion to sell real estate” with the local court but it still hasn’t been approved by a judge yet. Who knows how long this whole process could take (i.e. waiting for the motion to be approved, find a real estate agent, get the house on the market, get the house sold, etc.) so I’m literally stuck trying to cover ALL the household bills, plus my own bills, for the foreseeable future.  \nAnother HUGE problem I have is that when we actually do sell the house.. I have literally no where to go. With the money I currently make, it’s BARELY enough to cover everything and I have MAYBE $100 left to myself at the end of each month so I don’t see how I could save money for a down payment, deposit, etc. for an apartment.  \nWith the money left over (after paying off my fathers debts, what’s left on the mortgage, and giving my brother his half) I’m making an educated guess, that I would be left with $58,000 (on the low end, could be more given todays housing market). But what do I do in the mean time until I have that money in my hand? Like I said, I have no where to go. Also, what about my roommates? Im getting a little sick of being taken advantage of. In a perfect situation, we could all pool our money and find a decent 2 bed. 2 bath. apartment somewhere but that’s not the case. My feeling is “If they’re taking advantage of me now, it probably won’t be any different when we move somewhere else.” But at the same time, I would feel horrible about leaving them on the street. My boyfriend is a felon (from an arrest over 10 years ago) and he smokes marijuana daily so that’s 2 strikes against him when it comes to jobs and apartments. He was technically homeless when he moved in with me. My best friend has a job but, she definitely can’t afford her own apartment with todays prices AND like I said, she calls out AT LEAST once a week.  \nAny advice that anyone could give me would mean the world to me and I very much appreciate anyone who took the time to read this post!  \n  \n-Stuck between a rock and a hard place",

        "text": "I've spent the last 5 days crying as I realised I've destroyed my marriage.\nI can't describe it all well enough, but everything hit breaking point over so many critical things.\n1.  I was cruel and made snide comments about her eating, the way she would do things around the house, or not do things leading to significant medical decisions to have gastric sleeve, but I still harassed her after everything\n2.  I had a vasectomy, against her wishes to conceive a third child\n3.  I sexually assaulted her in our marriage, in my head I didn't think it was the case, I later found out it was\n4.  We had vastly different sexual incompatibilities, I wanted more, she wanted less\n5.  She was so untidy and uncaring about the state of our home, it frustrated me \n6.  I've been a wet blanket, dampening every fun and joyful thing for our whole relationship\n\nI'm my heart I thought I was a good husband, a good father.  \n\nI would regularly do the majority of house work.  Cleaning, cooking, lunches, breakfasts, dinners, washing.  \n\nWe would once or twice argue each year about the distance and disconnect in intimacy.  Or even the constant mess I was cleaning around the house.\n\nCritical point came when she started full time work again after being a stay at home mum for years.  The work took over, I helped the best I could looking after the kids on school holidays, make her breakfast lunch and dinner every day, cleaning everything and maintaining everything.  She was never around.  Weeks of constant late night work at home.\n\nShe felt like she was getting distant from me\n\nI was awoken one night, late as always, 1130 or so, and as I usually did, reminded her she was so late and to go to sleep, always having to be up by 630.  She continued as she usually did to stay on her phone talking to friends.  But this night she was so suspicious.  Trying to hide it.\n\nI arose and silently crept from the room to check get computer, to see who she was talking to.\nI invaded her privacy, but I was concerned.\nShe was talking to a older male work colleague about how I was monitoring her that night, I read the conversation history and it read like she was hiding a relationship from me and had been discussing leaving me.\n\nI panicked.  I was so shaken\n\nI went back and asked who he was, it was stunned silence.\n\nWe argued.  I blamed her as I always did.\nIt was simply venting about our relationship.\nThe conversation was eventually revealed as innocent enough\n\nBut I was cautious.\n\nA few days later I was so shaken by my analysis of that conversation and realised everything was my fault.\n\nI realised I'd been emotionally abusing my wife for near 10 years, and manipulated her even longer.\nI never realised it\nI never thought that was me\nBut it all made sense.\n\nI'm now so broken\n\nMy wife has just flicked a switch and disconnected emotionally.  Literally, no tears as I break down in remorse.\n\nI panicked today just to get some sense of awareness of her state of mind as she kept repeating to me that she didn't know if we could be saved ... I packed and left, sitting in a park crying.  \n\nI went back, she was now even more distant and ready to call it quits.\n\nI accept it.  But I want to save it.\n\nI'm so broken, I love this woman and I drove her away.\n\nShe is the kindest and sweetest person I know... And I ruined it all.\n\nShe tried to express how I hurt her every time we had an argument in the past, and I rejected it as her fault.\n\nI'm so remorseful, I've written every moment I know I've been selfish, instances of time and common mistakes I made in an effort to acknowledge every where I went wrong.  Everything I did wrong.\nI read her the list... And I got no emotion from her\n\nShe couldn't tell me that she wanted to save us.\n\nI've lost it all\n\nI want to know if there is anyone advice on how I can save it, what steps I can do... Anything???\n\nTLDR; I realised too late in my marriage that I was the cause for all our pain, and I want to know if there is anyone advice on how I can save it, what steps I can do... Anything???",

        "text": "\n\nHey everyone. So I’m in the process of starting a business and I have to do some market research. It’s pretty broad, ages 18-45, open gender, open ethnicity, open sexual orientation, all that. I don’t want to divulge too much, but it’s a concept based in the self-help industry. I’m trying to gauge what demographic utilizes certain types of personal development tools. At any rate, I keep a small social circle, I don’t have a social media presence really. Any tips on where I could get participants that wouldn’t be too spammy? The total survey would only take 15 minutes or so. About ten questions outside of the whole age, gender, ethnicity stuff.",

        "text": "Hello all. I’ve been struggling with making friends for so long now and hitting my 30th birthday just made me feel incredibly down about it. I know it will just get harder to make a friend the older i get. I even got a second job in hopes of meeting people and making friends but no one seems to be interested when i’ve repeatedly reached out. I do like my alone time and i’m trying to be content and happy without a social life but i am so lonely. I’ve honestly forgotten what it’s like to have or be a friend. I’m afraid i don’t know how to go about it or that i’m doing something wrong. reaching out to people is very scary and hard for me. any advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.",
