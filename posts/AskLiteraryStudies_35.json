The question I am doing is:\n\n**Explore in detail how the operation of the senses, such a sight, hearing and touch, is represented in works by at least two authors. You should discuss the representation of at least two senses within your answer.**\n\nNow, problem is that I can't use Wordsworth as I'm using him for a previous question about the harmony/tension of nature and imagination. Sucks, right? So I'm looking at Keats' Odes -- mainly Nightingale -- and William Hazlitt's essay ['The Indian Jugglers'](http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Essays/Hazlitt/TableTalk/Jugglers.htm) (as well as maybe throwing in a little bit about Charles Lamb's ['Convalescent'](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10343/10343-8.txt) (ctrl+f if you need it) and ['My First Play'](http://www.angelfire.com/nv/mf/elia1/play.htm), too).\n\nAs it stands I have that Keats uses the song of the nightingale to escape from the realities of life. That he abandons his sense of vision and goes into a sort of sleep, or trance, in a 'drowsy numbness' in order to further embrace the sound and what it represents -- immortality and escape? (I'm 100% not sure about any of this, mind you!)\n\nI'm thinking about trying to make a point about how the dulling of the senses was a common theme, too, as in Lamb's Convalescent and in Nightingale -- dulling them allows the narrator/author to surpass their restrictiveness and achieve greatness/the infinite?\n\nDo any of these even sound remotely like they would work? Or maybe even trying to argue that the senses are represented as inefficient and not nearly enough for greatness, somehow?\n\nPlease help. I am at absolute loss. ",

        "text": "I'm looking for critical sources similar to *How To Kill A Dragon* by Calvert Watkins..  a really heavy book predominantly to do with linguistics , though I admit that I had only skimmed through it,  had wanted something more general. It argues that there is a shared cultural history of mythology to do with \"hero's journey of man kills dragon for fame\" all over the world and this is at the centre of what is \"poetry\", but the problem is, at least to me anyway, that that isn't what ever happens.. in a significant sense, it is often \"man succumbs to dragon, then becomes a hero with supernatural faculties\" , and I'd say that there is a lot of depth to this argument. somewhere below I will post some recommendations of what is, to me , the chaoskampf.. but generally speaking I am wondering if anyone has taken the massive doorstopper of Watkins thesis and made it a bit more accessible , or if there is anything similar to it  with more theory  - even if it doesn't agree with my view of what the chaoskampf essentially is, I'd be interested to read it. \n\nThe best I have found so far is Coleridge And the Daemonic Imagination by Gregory Leadbetter , and he did an excellent lecture uploaded to [youtube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swvElUnS-s) . He says that Coleridge re-wrote the myth of the fall, like a chaoskampf, as a sort of gnostic myth of becoming . I'm amazed with his thesis because I believe emphatically you could apply it generally to a lot of other works. \n\n*Fascinated by his own imagination, Coleridge secretly wrote that its characteristic blend of power and desire made him a \"Daemon\": a being superstitiously feared as \"a something transnatural.\" Coleridge and the Daemonic Imagination examines this simultaneous experience of exaltation and transgression as a formative principle in Coleridge's poetry and the fabric of his philosophy. In a reading that spans the breadth of Coleridge's achievement, through politics, religion and his relationship with Wordsworth, this book builds to a new interpretation of the poems where Coleridge's daemonic imagination produces its myths: \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" \"Kubla Khan\" and \"Christabel.\" Gregory Leadbetter reveals a Coleridge at once more familiar and more strange, in a study that unfolds into an essay on poetry, spirituality, and the drama of human becoming.*\n\nSome authors I am already familiar with. These authors would argue that horror presents deeper issues beyond the common argument that horror is written to scare you, in fact that isn't at all what classic horror does . These authors consider horror to be something not just central to but entirely defining the field of what people around the world would consider \"religion\" or the supernatural, horror not only expresses the supernatural, but that religion itself is best expressed in the horror genre and is itself horrific. \n\n Eugene Thacker,\nHorror Of Philosophy in three volumes\n\n Matt Cardin,\nDark Awakenings\n\nDavid J Hufford,\nThe Terror That Comes In The Night\n\n Thomas Ligotti,\nConspiracy Against The Human Race\n\n Hans Peter Duerr,\nDreamtime: Concerning The Boundary Between Wilderness And Civilization\n\nRichard Gavin, \nThe Benighted Path: Primeval Gnosis And the Monstrous Soul (forthcoming)\n\nJeffrey J Kripal,\nMutants And Mystics \n\nRudolf Otto,\nIdea Of The Holy \n\nI've already found lots of great critical sources. I'm fascinated with the Watkins book but it's really just too beyond my knowledge level as I am not a linguist. \n\nSo, some examples of the chaoskampf , as I see it.. besides H. P. Lovecraft's Colour Out Of Space, Shadow Out Of Time, or Algernon Blackwood's The Wendigo, weird authors you're all familiar with already, think about these stories  films and games in the following way, \n\nStar Wars , Darth Vader - He's someone essentially initiated into a spectral cult, comes to an awareness of pneumatic consciousness and in Empire Strikes Back there is that scene where Luke Skywalker fights him and loses his hand, then falls into the abyss. \n\nJob 4, King James Version.. notice passage 9 \"By the blast of God they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed\", the particularity of the breath and other significant meaning of the passage is lost in newer translations.. if anybody reads Greek or Hebrew or whatever and could enlighten me if this is what the originals actually more accurately say , I'd be curious about that, or if this is some kind of King James gnostic slip. This is a pretty classic chaoskampf story and why I think Watkins analysis is non sensical, as far as I understand his central argument anyway, besides being simply hard to read he's just wrong as far as I know about what a chaoskampf even is, since it's not about killing the monster, as Star Wars shows. \n\nRock &amp; Rule - this is a Canadian movie made by Nelvana, [the final scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR-Z92eXVoo) parallels Buddha's enlightenment as an encounter with hungry ghosts in charnel grounds (see Haunting the Buddha by Robert DeCaroli , if you were curious about this reading), the story of the film after all takes place in Ohms-town.. although there is a battle with a dragon, she succumbs to it and is filled with its power, like Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker succumb to the dark side and are empowered. here's [some more clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zl-GVkEj_0) from this exceptionally bizarre film. \n\nNang Nak (Thai movie, 1999) - this is totally fascinating to me, the Thai audience will watch this film/folk story and root for the possessing ghost as a kind of national hero, the monks who exorcise her at the end of the story is an anti-climax . My belief is that this is really the story of Buddha's enlightenment  itself. I know this is not news to everyone but would probably shock many scholars of Buddhism, maybe not, and maybe shock many people interested in Buddhism that this is the view predominantly throughout asia but not here. It's very much a story that retells the myth of Buddha's enlightenment, but, not in an esoteric way. \n\nSuper Metroid - There are long plays you can watch online but the beginning of the game is really this descent into an underworld, a battle with a dragon, and she undergoes profound soul loss before fleeing. \n\nDemon's Souls - Like Super Metroid, at the beginning of the game you die. You fight a dragon, he dispatches you easily enough, but then you resurrect at half your life to a kind of newly awakened pneumatic consciousness. \n\nDead Space video games series. \n\nin Dune, I haven't read the book for many years though have seen the movie a few times..  Paul drinks the water of life, which kills him, he's in the middle of the desert, he has a realization that the worms breathe the spice.  \n\nRime of the Ancient Mariner - this is the ultimate proto-text of this to me.. after going to \"the line\" and crossing the threshold , on the borders between life and death, succumbs to the serpent and is filled with mana, then wanders like Cain , cursed and manic . There's a critical analysis by a Gregory Leadbetter called Coleridge And the Daemonic Imagination that I really loved. There's a class lecture [uploaded to youtube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swvElUnS-s) by the author. \n\nMy problem is that I am a student, I've fond some incredibly good sources for analyzing horror fiction, I feel like I have gotten able to grasp modern horror authors thinking about horror exceptionally well, but I lack any basic text that explains this point of view. I want something like How To Kill A Dragon, or Mutants And Mystics, like really general . ",

E.g., what sort of evidentiary standards ought I try to meet, what is an acceptable way to structure the argument, what is an example of a roughly comparable idea well-executed, with what sort of criticisms will literature scholars tear it apart. The argument is:\n\nAyn Rand's *The Fountainhead* is a masturbation fantasy. This becomes clear when one compares it to a well-known masturbation fantasy of opposite gendered author and protagonist: The Marquis de Sade's *Juliette*. Both are stories of the triumph, in a slightly better world, of an imagined man or woman for whom the current world is not ready. Both contain substantial (and similar) philosophical portions, but these are included because they are the sort of things the author dreams of her or his idealized mate saying or thinking. Neither presents a protagonist worthy of emulation in the real world.\n\nWhile I plan to write this mainly for the benefit (or detriment) of my fellow economists, it would help for my paper to have some semblance to the work of someone trained to make such arguments.

My line of thought is that the proportion of bad litterature among the best-sellers was as high as it is today, and many bestsellers will be totally forgotten in a few years, maybe decades, as it happened for the last centuries. Only the masterpieces will resist the passing of time.\n\nSo, in which proportion were the bestsellers' shelves in libraries full of bad, long-forgotten litterature ? And what kind of books were they ?\nI would be more specifically interested in answers concerning Europe, or French Litterature, but I'll take whatever you give me, eh.\n\nEdit : Je viens de voir qu'il s'agit d'un subreddit multilingue, je suis donc également intéressé par les réponses en français, la littérature française étant ce qui m'intéresse le plus. \n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/35auvd/studying_the_chaoskampf/",
        "text": "I'm looking for critical sources similar to *How To Kill A Dragon* by Calvert Watkins..  a really heavy book predominantly to do with linguistics , though I admit that I had only skimmed through it,  had wanted something more general. It argues that there is a shared cultural history of mythology to do with \"hero's journey of man kills dragon for fame\" all over the world and this is at the centre of what is \"poetry\", but the problem is, at least to me anyway, that that isn't what ever happens.. in a significant sense, it is often \"man succumbs to dragon, then becomes a hero with supernatural faculties\" , and I'd say that there is a lot of depth to this argument. somewhere below I will post some recommendations of what is, to me , the chaoskampf.. but generally speaking I am wondering if anyone has taken the massive doorstopper of Watkins thesis and made it a bit more accessible , or if there is anything similar to it  with more theory  - even if it doesn't agree with my view of what the chaoskampf essentially is, I'd be interested to read it. \n\nSome authors I am already familiar with. These authors would argue that horror presents deeper issues beyond the common argument that horror is written to scare you, in fact that isn't at all what classic horror does . These authors consider horror to be something not just central to but entirely defining the field of what people around the world would consider \"religion\" or the supernatural, horror not only expresses the supernatural, but that religion itself is best expressed in the horror genre and is itself horrific. \n\n Eugene Thacker,\nHorror Of Philosophy in three volumes\n\n Matt Cardin,\nDark Awakenings\n\nDavid J Hufford,\nThe Terror That Comes In The Night\n\n Thomas Ligotti,\nConspiracy Against The Human Race\n\n Hans Peter Duerr,\nDreamtime: Concerning The Boundary Between Wilderness And Civilization\n\nRichard Gavin, \nThe Benighted Path: Primeval Gnosis And the Monstrous Soul (forthcoming)\n\nJeffrey J Kripal,\nMutants And Mystics \n\nRudolf Otto,\nIdea Of The Holy \n\nI've already found lots of great critical sources. I'm fascinated with the Watkins book but it's really just too beyond my knowledge level as I am not a linguist. \n\nSo, some examples of the chaoskampf , as I see it.. besides H. P. Lovecraft's Colour Out Of Space, Shadow Out Of Time, or Algernon Blackwood's The Wendigo, weird authors you're all familiar with already, think about these stories  films and games in the following way, \n\nStar Wars , Darth Vader - He's someone essentially initiated into a spectral cult, comes to an awareness of pneumatic consciousness and in Empire Strikes Back there is that scene where Luke Skywalker fights him and loses his hand, then falls into the abyss. \n\nJob 4, King James Version.. notice passage 9 \"By the blast of God they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed\", the particularity of the breath and other significant meaning of the passage is lost in newer translations.. if anybody reads Greek or Hebrew or whatever and could enlighten me if this is what the originals actually more accurately say , I'd be curious about that, or if this is some kind of King James gnostic slip. This is a pretty classic chaoskampf story and why I think Watkins analysis is non sensical, as far as I understand his central argument anyway, besides being simply hard to read he's just wrong as far as I know about what a chaoskampf even is, since it's not about killing the monster, as Star Wars shows. \n\nRock &amp; Rule - this is a Canadian movie made by Nelvana, [the final scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR-Z92eXVoo) parallels Buddha's enlightenment as an encounter with hungry ghosts in charnel grounds (see Haunting the Buddha by Robert DeCaroli , if you were curious about this reading), the story of the film after all takes place in Ohms-town.. although there is a battle with a dragon, she succumbs to it and is filled with its power, like Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker succumb to the dark side and are empowered. here's [some more clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zl-GVkEj_0) from this exceptionally bizarre film. \n\nNang Nak (Thai movie, 1999) - this is totally fascinating to me, the Thai audience will watch this film/folk story and root for the possessing ghost as a kind of national hero, the monks who exorcise her at the end of the story is an anti-climax . My belief is that this is really the story of Buddha's enlightenment  itself. I know this is not news to everyone but would probably shock many scholars of Buddhism, maybe not, and maybe shock many people interested in Buddhism that this is the view predominantly throughout asia but not here. It's very much a story that retells the myth of Buddha's enlightenment, but, not in an esoteric way. \n\nSuper Metroid - There are long plays you can watch online but the beginning of the game is really this descent into an underworld, a battle with a dragon, and she undergoes profound soul loss before fleeing. \n\nDemon's Souls - Like Super Metroid, at the beginning of the game you die. You fight a dragon, he dispatches you easily enough, but then you resurrect at half your life to a kind of newly awakened pneumatic consciousness. \n\nDead Space video games series. \n\nin Dune, I haven't read the book for many years though have seen the movie a few times..  Paul drinks the water of life, which kills him, he's in the middle of the desert, he has a realization that the worms breathe the spice.  \n\nRime of the Ancient Mariner - this is the ultimate proto-text of this to me.. after going to \"the line\" and crossing the threshold , on the borders between life and death, succumbs to the serpent and is filled with mana, then wanders like Cain , cursed and manic . There's a critical analysis by a Gregory Leadbetter called Coleridge And the Daemonic Imagination that I really loved. There's a class lecture [uploaded to youtube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swvElUnS-s) by the author. \n\nMy problem is that I am a student, I've fond some incredibly good sources for analyzing horror fiction, I feel like I have gotten able to grasp modern horror authors thinking about horror exceptionally well, but I lack any basic text that explains this point of view. I want something like How To Kill A Dragon, or Mutants And Mystics, like really general . ",

Really famous contemporary examples being,\n\n[Demon's Souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsv8eThKJ7Y) series of games -- You are made to battle an undefeatable chaos monster, you resurrect at half life in a heaving and broken pneumatic condition, with the ability to gather mana from the environment. \n\nJob 4:9, King James Version -- \"By the blast of God they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed\"\n\nStar Wars, Darth Vader - Initiated into a spectrally intense gothic cult, becomes a human puppet to his spirit master, broken to pneumatic awareness.  It is notable that in Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker has a chapel perilous experience, the danger of becoming his Father (God, Elohim), and in his fight with Darth Vader loses his hand, which becomes robotic or possessed. \"Luke , I am your Father\"\n\n[Rock &amp; Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR-Z92eXVoo) - An angel about to be sacrificed to a demon from Hell, ends up.. sacrificing herself anyway.. by profusely empathizing with the demonic force and embodying it, camera pulls back to an explosion of light out of the darkness, enlightenment. From the creators of Care Bears, similar ideas to that cartoon as well .\n\n[Super Metroid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB317FOcU0Y) -- Bounty hunter gets called to a distress signal, experimental lab of scientists all devoured, I forget the whole story anyway the link is very good.. kind of like Rock &amp; Rule.. just watch the beginning intro story.. anyway..  a metroid clings to her thinking she is its mother. She fights some dragon thing, then manic sick and wounded flees a spinning tower, at half her health .\n\n Dune - drinking the water of life kills him\n\nLord of the Rings - Frodo bearing the ring or the cross as a gateway to the supernatural, his sacrifice temple of his body\n\nI found this,\n\n[How To Kill A Dragon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Kill-Dragon-Aspects-Indo-European/dp/0195144139/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431019566&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+to+kill+a+dragon),\n*Watkins examines in detail the structure of the dragon/serpent-slaying myths, which recur in various guises throughout the Indo-European poetic tradition. He finds the \"signature\" formula for the myth--the divine hero who slays the serpent or overcomes adversaries--occurs in the same linguistic form in a wide range of sources and over millennia, including Old and Middle Iranian holy books, Greek epic, Celtic and Germanic sagas, down to Armenian oral folk epic of the last century. Watkins argues that this formula is the vehicle for the central theme of a proto-text, and a central part of the symbolic culture of speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language: the relation of humans to their universe, the values and expectations of their society. Therefore, he further argues, poetry was a social necessity for Indo- European society, where the poet could confer on patrons what they and their culture valued above all else: \"imperishable [sic] fame.\"* \n\nbut it's not an accurate interpretation of the chaoskampf for one thing and for another it's a very heavy book of linguistics, I wanted something similar . \n\nThree other authors I have found,\n\nThomas Ligotti \n\nEugene Thacker\n\nMatt Cardin \n\nhas to do with a soul destroying view of religion , and a kind of supernatural nihil-ism , like H. P.  Lovecraft \n\nspeaking of which, Colour Out Of Space, Shadow Out Of Time, this guy does the chaoskampf motif over and over , also The White People by Arthur Machen, the Wendigo by Algernon Blackwood , the song Man-Erg by Van Der Graff Generator \"a killer lives inside me.. then his eyes will rise and stare through mine.. angels despots refugees all are these angels despots refugees… ah ah ah.. etc.\" masterpiece song. \n\nthe hero gets devoured and remade with supernatural powers \n\n if you're interested in analyzing the proto-myth at the centre of our lives at all times year in and year out we see films we read books we play games where these themes are in there, I could recommend many many other games and stories like the Dead Space video game series or Under The Dome by Stephen King (the pink stars are falling in lines..) then yeah please respond with recommended sources. I'm a student and I consider this particular proto-text central to what horror fiction is. I found books by Jeffrey J Kripal very useful, author of [Mutants And Mystics](http://www.amazon.com/Mutants-Mystics-Science-Superhero-Paranormal/dp/0226453839/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431019600&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mutants+and+mystics) , he draws his inspiration and knowledge from experiences in his personal life that are chaoskampf like. He studies genre, horror fantasy the paranormal and so on. Though his books are very specialized knowledge I wanted something more general. Other books I liked, [Dreamtime: Concerning The Boundary Between Wilderness And Civilization](http://www.amazon.com/Dreamtime-Concerning-Boundary-Wilderness-Civilization/dp/0631155481/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431019728&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dreamtime+hans+peter+duerr) by Hans Peter Duerr, [The Terror That Comes In The Night](http://www.amazon.com/Terror-That-Comes-Night-Experience-Centered/dp/081221305X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431019788&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=terror+that+comes+in+the+night)  by David J Hufford especially useful for Canadian wilderness horror gnosis studies, [Sleep Paralysis: Night-mares, Nocebos, And the Mind-Body Connection](http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Paralysis-Night-mares-Connection-Anthropology/dp/0813548861/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431019843&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sleep+paralysis+night-mares+nocebos) by Shelley R Adler\n\nthe absolute best elucidations on these themes in English I have found, being *A Strange Manuscript Found In A Copper Cylinder* by James De Mille, *A Voyage To Arcturus* by David Lindsay, *Rime of the Ancient Mariner* by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, a Thai film from 1999 called [Nang Nak](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217680/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1), the proto text is essentially a shamanic initiation to a nether-world of hungry ghosts, either more or less traditional to various cultures, surprisingly indigenous to english studies . Nang Nak is really the story of Buddha's enlightenment , the exorcism at the end of the film resonates with the Thai people as an anti-climax. Anyone interested in asian studies must see this film. Compares easily with Romanticism. This is my malfunction in life is that I see it this way. ",

It seems clear enough that deconstruction in the 70s and 80s was fascinated by form, and notions like the fold, the frame, invagination, rhetorical undecidability and so on were brought to bear on things like genre, the inside and outside of a text, or even something as foundational as the distinction between form and content. But in the last decades of the 20th century, both Derrida’s work and readings of de Man’s legacy took their well-known turn towards a more overtly political interest, and it’s not clear to me that there’s been a significant move away from that since. So I’m wondering if ‘form’ is still a question or a project for contemporary literary scholars working from a deconstructive perspective, or if it is, whose work is currently considered to be representative or interesting (*i.e.*, who should I be reading to catch up on this, if it’s out there?).

Otherwise, sigh, I must answer them myself. The questions follow: 1. What do you think was the leading conflict throughout the entirety of Hamlet? 2. Does Hamlet find a resolution to his internal conflicts? What do you think that resolution was? 3. What other characters are facing conflicts? What are they? How do they relate to Hamlet’s conflicts? 4. What other literary devices does Shakespeare use to exemplify conflict (i.e. weather)? 5. Do you think the conflicts portrayed in the play are realistic and/or easy to relate to?\nThesis: Through the schemes of corruption, Shakespeare develops the theme of conflict in Hamlet by illustrating the clashes of personality among the characters of this tragedy.",

For example, a reading of Robinson Crusoe that sees it as a \"translation\" of the Prodigal Son into Defoe's ideological context, or *The Isle of Pines* as a reworking of Genesis as it might occur with colonial era Englishmen as Adam and Eve. If anyone would know of a re*writing* of the Bible in the biblical tone that appeared between the King James Version and *Robinson Crusoe*, I think it would be a useful measurement of the changing attitudes toward the sacristy not only of theological interpretations of the Bible, but a de-idolization of the narrative DNA of that foundational text...",

The signs all seem to point towards Eekhoud.  I've found suitable criticism which confirm Wikipedia's assertion that there's homosexuality present in his works, but finding something that will confirm that La Nouvelle Carthage is a tale of \"brutal life of love and death in the Antwerp dockland metropolis and its dirty industry\" is proving substantially more difficult. I've checked the Oxford dictionary of biography(online), the New Oxford companion to authors writing in french(text), and all I got from the  Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Authors(online) was that La Nouvelle Carthage was \"a true novel of a city (Antwerp)\".\n\nShould I just throw caution to the wind and reference it from Gutenberg as if I've read it?  \n\n",

I'm currently trying to come up with a subject for my B-level thesis, and had originally thought to compare the function of technology in creating versus destroying the monster in /Frankenstein/ and /Dracula/. (I was planning to do this with a structural approach, using Lacan's theory of discourses and looking at the texts of Friedrich Kittler.) However, I had not yet read /Frankenstein/ and it seems that technology didn't play the role that I thought (it was rather alchemy and philosophy). \n\nSo I'm looking for a new literary work with which I can compare Dracula and how media technology is used. My scope is currently very wide, but I think I want to look at something which either involves:\n\n* More modern medial technology in some sense. It doesn't even have to be a monster in it, but a novel that somehow revolves around computer technology and how it's able to transmit information. \n\n* A gothic novel prefferably from 1850-1950 in which technology in some sense serves to create a monster.\n\nBut if anything pops into mind that seems like it might be relevant, please feel free to comment, I'm really looking for just about anything at this point.\n\nBest regards\n\nHansgreger",
