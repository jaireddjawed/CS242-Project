I work in underwater robotics. \n\nI have a bachelors and masters in Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering. I don’t have a PhD. I also don’t have any publications.\n\nThere’s an opportunity for a research fellowship for 1 year in Switzerland. My organisation is willing to fund it if I get a research supervisor there. \n\nI honestly don’t have any contacts. I tried getting  contacts from my colleagues but they didn’t seem very helpful. I met some professors from abroad (not Swiss though) at my organisation during an event early this year. I emailed them to ask if they know someone in Switzerland. It’s been a week. I emailed 4 people, so far no one has replied.\n\nI really want this fellowship. It will add a good research experience on my cv and also help in my PhD applications. \n\nNow I am thinking of emailing professors that work in a field that I am interested in conducting my research in. I emailed one professor just to test the waters. He also did not reply. \n\nI am feeling sad that just because there’s no one to put me in touch with them, I’m going to lose this opportunity. \n\nPlease tell me what to do. Shall I start emailing the professors? How do I make sure it catches their attention and how do I make myself seem like a good candidate? Shall I put my picture in my email account so that they can put a face to the text?\n\nI’m interested in anything related to robotics/underwater robotics like computer vision, machine learning etc.\n\nThanks.

But my supervisor and professors were dismissive of my interests considering me overconfident and \"someone who thinks they are great researchers or can be\" (someone too full of themselves). In any case, they were interested in test scores and rote learning and never on research. I did one semester of course in research in my undergrad and the supervisor only brushed through the basics. \n\nI am thinking of starting my own research and writing my own articles and maybe try for PhD. I know it might not be possible with such scarce hands on training but I really want to give research article writing for journal articles a shot. \nI know longer have access to the library at my university so I cannot get books on loan. Also, academic books are prohitively expensive given the exchange rate, import duties and the insane amount of red tape surrounding the outflow of foreign currency from the country. So, I am preferrably looking for a free book(s) on how to write research articles and to know the intellectual property rights regarding my work. \n\nI want to learn how to write articles for journals and I am looking for books that will teach me how. Can someone suggest some brief yet comprehensive books that I should read to teach myself how to write research articles? ",

I believe I have good chances to be accepted into a good PhD program in PolSci in the US if I study for GRE and apply.\n\nHowever, as much as I like to do research, academic career doesn't look appealing to me, let alone the rat race that appears to be PolSci's in particular. I would like to work for an international organization, and that's why I've picked this M.A. in first place. Turns out it appears that might be quite tricky to get into IOs with a M.A. in IR from a non-central country (of course, I might be wrong, and would love to be corrected). I have no way means to pay for a Masters abroad, and the PhD alternative seems doable.\n\nI'm afraid to be \"overqualified\" and away for a long period of time to go back to the job market and get turned down by everyone if everything goes wrong. Unfortunately I have no one who could advise me on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!",

I have to get it approved by an advisor and have to present it to a committee via Skype (details all TBD, obviously). Unfortunately, it's hard to get an advisor to approve a creative project if I don't have an advisor to begin with.\n\nI've tried contacting people via e-mail in the past: four professors, and even the department chair. Three of those four professors didn't bother e-mailing me back. The one professor who e-mailed me back basically told me that she only works with people who have gotten As or A-s in a Ph.D.-level course (which I do not have access to, given that I'm an online student, so *that's convenient*). The department chair recommended that I contact two professors. I haven't tried this yet.\n\nIt's been about a year since I did the above. And I'm not sure how I'm going to word an e-mail request to a professor. I feel that I'm an online student in a master's program, so that on its own gives two reasons for professors not to pay attention to me (1: I'm not on-site, and 2: I'm not a Ph.D. student). What I fear most is that this will prevent me from graduating.\n\nWhat do I do? How do I word such a request to a professor?",

The notion is genuinely bizarre to me. I get straight As, socialize, maintain relationships, exercise, cook, and get enough sleep while taking five classes (including graduate courses), volunteering, and working two jobs.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nAny advice or thoughts you have would be great. No need to sugarcoat. I like this sub a lot and have been lurking for quite awhile now. I apologize in advance for the length of this, I just don't know where else to turn to get objective advice. I can't get a read on if I've smeared my name forever in this program or if I still have a chance to turn things around.\n\nBackground: I am going into my 2nd year of my PhD. Classes start Monday. I spent nearly all of my 20s working on getting into a doctorate program (BS, MS, tons of research and practice experience, 5 rounds of GREs, two rounds of applying....etc). I four pointed my master's and worked my ass off and finally I got into a great program. Aaaaaand now I've proceeded to royally fuck up this past year.\n\nI have always absolutely sucked at doing things ahead of time. I'm a procrastinator at heart. I also avoid things that make me anxious (e.g. big assignments) like the plague because they freak me out. I got through my BS and MS without this messing me up very much. I missed a deadline here or there but it was never the norm.  I was diagnosed with ADHD after my bachelor's but never needed/sought any accommodations during my master's. Now in my PhD its become absolutely impossible for me to meet deadlines in my classes and I'm not sure what to do next. Most of the time my GA work hasn't suffered the same (e.g. I've kept up with the deadlines there), but its getting worse.\n\nOne class first semester is a good example because it was particularly terrible. I am not exaggerating when I say that I think I turned in almost every single assignment in that class late. I also showed up consistently late to the same class. Sometimes I missed class. It was just an absolute shit show. I met with my professor halfway through the semester and was like \"I am so sorry, I don't know what my problem is but I know it is not OK and I'm trying to work on it\". He told me he didn't care about my tardiness in his class because my work was good and usually only a few hours late, but that it would definitely bite me later in life if I didn't shape up. Obviously he is correct. Every time I missed a deadline I'd swear up and down to myself that I'd never do it again and I'd learned my lesson...yada yada...and then I'd miss another one soon after. I thought maybe my mental health was the problem (I have anxiety and depression in addition to ADHD). I got myself back into counseling and started seeing a psychiatrist again for medication management. My depression is better but my anxiety and attention issues are still problems and at times make quality of life quite difficult. I somehow passed all my classes with A's and B's and swore second semester would be better. ...I'm sure you can guess what happened next.\n\nLong story short - 2nd semester was also a shit-show. I again had major issues with tardiness. Sometimes I made up excuses. Sometimes I didn't. I kept waiting to get called out or get in trouble but no one said anything. I kept going to therapy and taking my medication and promising myself I'd figure it out. My therapist advised me to get accommodations because of my mental health, so I did. I met with the grad director about the accommodations (basically just to tell him I had them) and he was very understanding. He said he had not had any complaints about me or my work from faculty. I kept telling myself every time I missed a deadline that it was the last time. It never was. I lied (claimed technological problems, etc) my way through submitting all my finals late in all my classes at the end of second semester, which I still feel like shit about. Somehow no one called me out and I got A's in every class, which again - I don't understand because I don't understand how I am not being penalized for all this late work.\n\nSo onto the current issue...\n\nThis summer we had a huge project to complete that you have to pass to continue on to comps. It was basically a thesis and we had 4 months to do it. I've done a thesis. I know how time consuming it is. But I got married this summer (which has been planned for over two years so it's no excuse - I knew when it was happening for a loooong time) and let myself get distracted with wedding planning and moving and other research/work. I put writing the project off until the last minute, knowing full well it was a mistake but lying to myself that I'd have enough time. The deadline came and I had approximately half done. I had no choice but to just once again just turn in what I have and say \"I'm so sorry I know this is unacceptable but here's what I have. I will turn in the finished product ASAP. Totally know it probably won't count but I just want you to see that I'm capable.\" Now its more than 24 hours after the deadline and I still have a fuck ton of this project left. I'm an emotional wreck and I'm so ashamed and disappointed in myself and want to just say \"I'll fix it next time\". But frankly, I don't know if I will. And who knows if I will even have the chance - there is a chance I could get kicked out over this. Or have to repeat my entire first year. The project committee is meeting to figure out what to do with me.\n\nI'm fed up and exhausted and so is my husband (who has been riding this emotional roller coaster with me). As much as I love my program I just don't know if I should continue. If I am going to continue to mess up, I feel like leaving now is a better idea. I am currently ruining a good reputation I worked YEARS to build and replacing it with a shitty one that I don't want. Which is more irrational - to keep saying I'm going to magically break this pattern or cling to the possibility I could figure it out? What if this is just a sign that I don't want this PhD enough or care enough about my work?\n\nI keep seeing job announcements that sound cool through our school that only call for a BS or MS and thinking \"If I could be happy with that, what the hell am I doing a PhD for?\" I'm second guessing all my original reasons for coming here in the first place. I'm about to turn 30 and haven't started a family yet. Maybe I should just throw in the towel and focus on the other things in life that could make me happy besides my career. I don't really care about publishing - I'm in this PhD for the research training and the applied work it will open doors to in my field. Maybe that is also a sign I should leave though? But if I do leave I know it will feel like I've wasted a ton of the last 10 years of my life - which were all focused on getting into grad school. \n\nDo I leave? Do I stick it out? I don't know what to do. Even if I do stick it out and manage to get my shit together - how much damage have I done already? Is it fixable? I feel like as a professor I would just be totally fed up with me by now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr - 2nd year PhD student, huge issue with tardiness to class and late assignments all first year. Apparently my quality of work is fine because I somehow got by with no lasting consequences and ended 1st year with good grades. Keep telling myself I've learned my lesson, but in reality I clearly haven't because I keep turning stuff in late. Mental health may be a factor but I feel like I'm already addressing it all I can (counseling, medication, accommodations). Just left huge summer project until last minute because I didn't prioritize correctly. Turned it in unfinished. Working on finishing but no idea if it will matter or how much longer it will take me. Have to pass said project in order to move on to comps at end of 2nd year. Committee is meeting to figure out what to do with me. Super frustrated and feel like maybe I just don't want this enough. Very bothered by the bad reputation I know I am building. Not sure if I should cut my losses and move on, or keep going. Can you come back from something like this or am I forever going to be looked at as a shitty grad student? I started looking and have seen MS jobs that appeal to me.",

EECS covers a broad area, including electrical power engineering, electronic devices, electrical control systems, communication systems, computer engineering, intelligent systems and software engineering''. \n\n\nSo i have been confused as to why is IT mentioned in there as that whole major is something different than that? And apart from that i can't tell the difference between Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science and Computer Science.\n\n",

I had a partner who was becoming an academic, and I felt I should be one too to be good enough. We broke up, and I was too deep into my degree to know what else to do. \n\nI just realized that I misunderstood an important result a long time ago, and have been acting on this wrong understanding for over two years. I am very lucky that my work is still correct, and only small parts need to be changed. I feel like a piece of crap, though.\n\nSo I am not good at what I do. If it is a life and death situation, I will sit down and learn a topic well. I will eventually forget everything, because I don't care about my field. I am missing a lot of the basics, but know how to wing it, so I am still floating. \n\nI don't know why, but at one point people started thinking I am some sort of a genius. Experiencing the disappointment that people go through when they realize that I am not devastates me. I don't want to be seen as anything. Then there are the sadists that have fun exposing me, humiliating and dominating me for being such a failure, and so on. So not only do I feel guilty, I also have very high external expectations and pressures that I have to work with. I tend to avoid everybody, which feeds into this who catch-22 thing. I just do not understand what anybody is talking about, and I don't care. \n\nI know that if I have to learn something to teach it, I will learn it well. I also know that I can apply things to the real world really well. Whatever I am doing right now, and whatever people value in academia are things I don't know how to deal with. \n\nI am very confident that I am going to graduate. I have a solid research plan, and am going to study well for my viva. I know I am getting my PhD. I am still terrified that someday someone will start digging, and then everybody realizes that I am a stupid nobody. \n\nMy advisor doesn't give a fuck, and only wants to get things done. Their modus operandi is throwing shit until something sticks, and it seems that compliments is the shit for me. I don't trust anything they say. I have no idea how I am doing, and I don't think it is imposter syndrome.",

One other faculty at my institution (already tenured) and a research prof at another university (not TT) have had some input so far but I have done 99% of the outline writing, lit search etc. The grant will be smaller (prob \\~$50k) and mainly a monitoring/sampling project without experimental manipulations. The work will be enough for a MS student who I would take on. \n\nMy question is about deciding who to put on as Co-PI and how to navigate that. After fleshing the grant out more, I'm not sure either of these other faculty are super beneficial to have as Co-PIs. Prof 1 is in a tangentially related field and adding something for him would broaden the scope of the project beyond what I believe is fundable in the eyes of the agency. He is newly tenured and involved in a lot of other things right now so I don't know how much time/effort he could realistically add and I don't know enough about his area to take on his part if need be. Prof 2 is already fairly well established, has students already working on other projects, and could be good to have on board for his experience but likely won't do much, or any, of the field work. However, I would most likely expect him to be an external person on my student's committee due to his expertise in the field. However, I feel like having established names as Co-PIs would make me more likely to get the project funded. Prof 2 is in a neighboring state so I think having multiple state institutions might make the project look better as well.\n\nSo what level of work is expected when including someone as a Co-PI? If I decide to not include one or both of these people as Co-PIs, how do I diplomatically tell them? It feels like I can't have them do hour-long conference calls and email chains and then suddenly say \"nope, sorry, you're out\". ",

I'm wondering when others decide that they've spent enough time on a draft to know that they should send it off to a journal (or book editor, etc.). I constantly find myself working on several projects on the go. I'm entering my fourth year as doctoral student in a social science related field (criminology, law, etc.) and find myself working on several projects at once. \n\nWhen working on thesis work, I'm inclined to let my supervisors see some less polished ideas for the sake of keeping things moving in the right direction rather than having to do serious re-writes/edits later in the writing and review process. Having only minimal experience with submitting papers for peer review (1 sole author; 1 co-author; 2 co-authors under review), I'm wondering how polished are the papers you submit to journals? What I'm really getting at is the fact that it seems like most peer review processes in the social sciences and humanities come back as revise and resubmits. If it is almost inevitable that you will have to satisfy the reviewer comments in order to satisfy the editor, and knowing what kind of feedback you will get during peer review is impossible to predict (and also sometimes a crapshoot), should I submit my papers when I feel like I have made a solid argument with ample theorization, despite knowing that things could be tightened up more? \n\nI'm not suggesting submitting half-baked ideas for publication. But I'm struggling with the idea of investing time into thinking of every single detail or every single piece of literature I might have missed in my argument/paper. If peer review is often going to lead me in other directions, should I account for this in my workload management and just come to the realization that I need to invest less time in trying to tinker every argument, paragraph, transition, etc. and just be focused on sending off well thought out (yet still malleable) pieces of writing in the interest of balancing my workload more efficiently and ensuring I can get enough publications out to be a strong candidate on the job market?",

My PI is going to help me out but I'd like to craft something halfway decent before present it to him to look over.\n\nMy student has a lot of great qualities:\n\n* She is self-motivating, independent, and comes up with great solutions on her own and by researching and asking questions\n* She works hard and is technically proficient\n* She's very friendly and got along well with everyone in the lab\n\nHowever, I think she has some qualities that could use some work, both related to a general lack of respect and sense of entitlement, and I'm not sure how best to word this in her evaluation:\n\n* She rarely says please and thank you, snatches things out of my hands, and has a sense of entitlement that I can't quite put my finger on. When I was an undergrad and I wanted my supervisor to do me a favour, I knew it would put them out (especially if it involved doing extra steps off hours/over the weekend, and I knew my place in the \"hierarchy\" of the lab and tried to show my respect and ask super politely. I've gotten none of that from her; she routinely *tells* me to do things for her instead of asking, and rarely says thank you. It's small, but it's a sense of entitlement/arrogance that to me translates to a basic lack of respect and selfishness. It doesn't affect her work, but I think it's in her best interest to correct this behaviour if she wants to move forward in any career.\n* She is putting together a talk to present to the lab (her first ever) and I have been firm in guiding her through the steps. For example, I asked for her slide deck, she didn't give me one. I asked for it in its final form yesterday, and she just showed me the same slide deck again, not altered. In other words, she has done things on her own time as she saw fit, and doesn't seem at all concerned that she isn't following my instructions. This is related to my first point in that it's a basic lack of respect for peoples' time and energy and entitlement. \n\n(I realize I should have nipped these in the bud early, but I have a hard time being stern sometimes, and that's something I need to work on. Happy for any tips you guys have here too.)\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on the wording you might use to write out some constructive, polite, and useful criticism on these two points? Thanks!",
