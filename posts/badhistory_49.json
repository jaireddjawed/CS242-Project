This is important.\n\nSo, I believe everyone here is well aware of [The Oatmeal's](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1ovjhs/askreddit_discusses_bs_most_people_believe_the/) [crimes against history.](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/24b7ix/the_oatmeal_explains_that_in_history_you_pick_a/) So frankly, this isn’t really anything new.\n\nBut in this case, bad history strikes in [a recent comic](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s) ~~advertising~~ expressing his love for his Motor S and asking Elon Musk to donate $8 million to build a Tesla Museum.\n\nTo fulfill Part 1 of R5, [I’ve cropped a screenshot of the bad history in question](http://i.imgur.com/1g1Hpgc.png). In case you can’t read that (because egads, that color scheme is horrendous and makes the text hard to read), here’s a transcript:\n\n&gt; And make no mistake, when it comes to big auto, they’re long overdue for trying something different.\n\n&gt; Anesthesia 100 years ago. \n\n&gt; [image of a balding man holding a stick out to a patient lying down]\n\n&gt; “Here, bite down on this stick while I saw your butt open and remove that pesky tumor”.\n\n&gt; Anesthesia NOW\n\n&gt; [image of a balding man giving a shot into a patient’s arm]\n\n&gt; “Here, take a long nap while I saw your butt open and remove that pesky tumor”.\n\nNow, to fulfill part 2 of R5:\n\n100 years ago means that we’re looking at a time period of 1914. So basically, the argument is that general anesthesia was not a thing in 1914.\n\nThis is a load of bullcrap. Let’s start with what general anesthesia is. \n\nGeneral anesthesia has three main goals: \n\n&gt; [(1) lack of movement (paralysis), (2) unconsciousness, and (3) blunting of the stress response.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia#General_anesthesia)\n\nParalysis: you want to be unable to move (because duh). Unconsciousness, because why the hell would you want to be awake for major surgery? And blunting the stress response, because you don’t want your blood pressure to spike super high or your pulse to run really quickly while you’re on the operating table. That would be very, very, very bad.\n\nWe think that general anesthesia works by affecting [“the spinal cord (which is why you end up immobile), the brain stem reticular activating system (which explains the unconsciousness) and the cerebral cortex (which results in changes in electrical activity on an electroencephalogram).”](http://science.howstuffworks.com/anesthesia4.htm) [It’s not as simple as giving a simple shot into a patient’s arm—you need to monitor the patient and make sure that the level on anesthesia is constant and that the patient is still breathing.](http://science.howstuffworks.com/anesthesia5.htm) But that is more in the purview of /r/badscience and not /r/badhistory.\n\nWe’ve been trying to get at anesthesia [since antiquity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_general_anesthesia), starting with the Sumerians messing around with opium poppy at approximately 3400 BCE. It’s believed that Hua Tao came across a formula for general anesthesia sometime during the [Eastern Han Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty#Eastern_Han):\n\n&gt; Hua Tuo (Chinese:华佗, c. AD 145-220) was a Chinese surgeon of the 2nd century AD. According to the Records of Three Kingdoms (c. AD 270) and the Book of the Later Han (c. AD 430), Hua Tuo performed surgery under general anesthesia using a formula he had developed by mixing wine with a mixture of herbal extracts he called mafeisan (麻沸散). Hua Tuo reportedly used mafeisan to perform even major operations such as resection of gangrenous intestines. Before the surgery, he administered an oral anesthetic potion, probably dissolved in wine, in order to induce a state of unconsciousness and partial neuromuscular blockade.\n\nThis information was lost when Hua Tuo burned his manuscripts prior to his death.\n\nBut I really shouldn’t be summarizing the entire Wikipedia article, so let’s get to where it gets interesting: the 1800s.\n\n[A short timeline of the development of general anesthesia in the Western hemisphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_general_anesthesia#Western_hemisphere):\n\n* Morphine is first isolated from opium in 1804.\n* Hickman, considered to be one of the fathers of anesthesia, does some experiments using carbon dioxide in animals, determining the effects of using carbon dioxide by amputating the animal’s limbs. This is published in a treatise titled *Letter on suspended animation: with the view of ascertaining its probable utility in surgical operations on human subjects* in 1824.\n* In the late 1830s, lecturers would demonstrate the use of ethers to the public. William Edward Clarke ([medical student](http://www.answers.com/topic/anesthesia-discovery-of)), Crawford W. Long ([physician](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawford_Long)), Horace Wells ([dentist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Wells)), and William T. G. Morton ([dentist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_T._G._Morton)) witnessed these events and took part.\n* Clarke is the first person to give anesthesia to a Miss Hobbie for extracting her tooth. However, he did not take his studies further.\n* Long began to administer ether as general anesthesia beginning in **1842** (as in, **172 years ago**), to remove tumors. However, he would not publish his findings until 1846. In the meanwhile, Wells began to use ether during dental surgery in 1844, and in 1846 Morton would administer ether in public demonstrations. \n* [Robert Liston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Liston) would use ether as a general anesthesia December 1846.\n* Chloroform was first used as general anesthesia in 1847 by James Young Simpson. Chloroform was used instead of ether in the early 20th century, but was soon abandoned when it was clear that it had a tendency to cause [cardiac dysrhythmia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia) (irregular heartbeat, which could be fatal).\n* [Friedrich Trendelenburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Trendelenburg) would publish a paper in 1871 “describing the first successful elective human tracheotomy to be performed for the purpose of administration of general anesthesia”.\n\nRemember, all of this is prior to 1914, the date that was implied in the Oatmeal’s latest comic.\n\nTL;DR: in regards to anesthesia, we had something much better than biting on sticks 100 years ago.",

        "text": "[Thread](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Shitstatistssay/comments/25b6zz/blasphemy_against_abraham_jesus_christ_lincoln_in/)\n\n/r/Shitstatistssay links to an /r/Conservative comment by a LibertyPatriot7 saying \"I absolutely **despise** lincoln. That man was **literally** America's Hitler. He butchered an entire generation all for a Federal power grab. This man would have made satan proud.\"\n\nLet's put everything wrong with that statement to the side, like the fact that Lincoln was not in fact **literally**Adolf Hitler.  I would like to address the comments made in the linked thread to ShitStatistsSay.\n\nThe same user from /r/Conservative is the top commenter in this thread.\n\n&gt; I certainly never expected so many people to defend his genocide of US citizens\n\nLibertyPatriot7 seems to believe that the American Civil War was a genocide. While the definition of genocide varies amongst legal scholars, the United Nations defines genocide as \n\n&gt; any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\n(a) Killing members of the group;\n(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group\n\nNo national, ethnical, racial or religious group was attacked with the intent to destroy.  A group of seceding states and their militaries were attacked with the intent of ending their state of rebellion.  A large number of citizens died, but that does not make the actions that took place a genocide.\n\nOn to the next claim.  \n\n&gt; Except Lincoln never freed any slaves in the north with the emancipation, just those slaves he no longer had control over.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation did not free any slaves in the north.  It \"freed\" slaves held in rebelling states, under Lincoln's power as Commander in Chief.  According to the [1860 Census](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html), this provided the legal framework for almost 3 out of 4 million slaves to be freed by the Executive Branch.  In his autobiography [Up From Slavery: an autobiography](http://books.google.com/books?id=xN45ZsUMgKEC&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), Booker T. Washington describes how he obtained his freedom due to the Emancipation Proclamation. Here is a [map](http://imgur.com/HC4TIrW) showing areas that would have been effected by the order.\nThe comment also ignores many other laws that were enacted under the Lincoln administration, such as the Act of Prohibiting the Return of Slaves which manumitted any slave that escaped to regions where slavery was illegal.  \nOh, and let's not forget that Lincoln was crucial in getting the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution passed, which explicitly stated that slavery was illegal in the U.S.\n\n\n&gt; Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\nSection 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation\n\nLincoln even signed the amendment on February 1st, 1865.\n\nSo the claim that Lincoln \"never any slaves in the north\" but only \"those slaves he no longer had control over\" is definitely false.\n\nNext claim by frsp.\n&gt; And he still took the time to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act through the entire war.\n\nThis claim is a little trickier for me.  The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was not repealed until 1864.  But the Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves was passed in 1862.  So what would the effect have been?  The 1862 law applied to the military, which were under Lincoln's control as Commander in Chief, disallowing them from using or returning slaves.  Under it no slave could be returned to their masters if they were in free territory.  But in the Border States such as Kentucky where slavery was legal, the Fugitive Slave Acts would still apply, so long as a slave was caught in slave territory.  But to claim that Lincoln enforced the Fugitive Slave Act a)personally and b)for the entire duration of the war is misleading and untrue.\n\nThe same user later cites Judge Andrew Napolitano for revealing this fact regarding the Fugitive Slave Act\n&gt; Andrew Napolitano called him out on it to a panel of \"historians\" on Jon Stewart and they went full retard and started screaming NO HE DIDN'T THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE!!! when 30 seconds of Googling could've prevented that.\n\nI guess 30 seconds of Googling could have prevented these poor claims.\n\nFor putting up with my attempt to deal with this bad history, I would like to thank you by providing what is believed to be an image showing what a child produced by the evil genocidal tyrant Lincoln and the misunderstood Hitler, who did nothing wrong, might have looked like.

He thereupon dispatched a delegation to the most powerful Moslem ruler he knew of. This happened to be the Emir of Morocco  \n\n\nR5: there's absolutely no evidence that this ever happened (nor would the Moroccan emir have been \"the most powerful Muslim ruler of whom he knew\"), and it seems incredible prima facie. The story seems to have been drawn from Matthew Paris' *Chronica Majora,* noted for its unreliability as a historical source (and dating from decades after the supposed attempt at conversion).   \n\n[In recent times, this story also seems to have found popularity in a \"National Review\" article published in October 2001 entitled *The United States of Islam.*](http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Religion/unitedstatesofislam.html) Interestingly, parts of the originally linked Muslim blog post seem to plagiarize this bit of Islamophobic literature.    \n\nBonus xenophobic badlinguistics from the NR article: \n&gt;\nIslamic footnote.  I increasingly see the name of the Islamic holy book written as \"Q'uran,\" \"Q'ūrân,\" or some such gibberish. How on earth is any English-speaking person supposed to cope with spellings like this? Why is it that when some foreign culture comes into the news we are all expected to run off and take seminars in graphology and comparative phonetics?

Not, like, just \"slavery\". Stuff like Harper's Ferry, Ruben Carter, the Buffalo Soldiers. In some cases the relation wasn't evident—one topic was just Elvis Presley, and it was up to the student to find out about how rock'n'roll came from black music. As you can probably figure out, most of the topics had some pop culture connection we might have been familiar with.\n\nAs a result the class got a surprisingly decent crash course in black history and U.

Completely natural to a request for roads. Especially that the lands separating the two parts of Germany\" Polish Corridor \"is not Targa\" - Kovalev says.\n\"In order to secure the status of a great power, Poland is in no way wanted to be a junior partner in Germany. March 26, 1939, Poland finally rejected German claims\" - indicates the Russian historian.\n\nSo he's basically implying that Poland is wrong to protect its ownership of a Polish city that has been a part of Poland for 600+ years.\n\nAnd yes, Danzig is a part of the reason for Germany to invade Poland BUT it's a small part of a bigger story.\n\nThe reason why Germany wants to invade Poland has many factors, from trying to weaken France and Britain's alliance with poland to the Lebensraum to the invasion of Czechslovakia. To accuse the Polish of singlehandedly causing WWII is to basically sidestep all the 6 years of Hitler preparing for war.\n\n&gt;\"Romantic belief in the justice and defense on the part of Western democracy while woo woo to Nazi Germany and antyradzieckość (often with anti-Russian elements) meant that they became for a time the pawns on the global chessboard of political, which could not influence the course of events\" - explains Kovalev.\n\nAh, so Western Democracy led to Poland being invaded, because Democracy is anti-Russian? Quai?\n\nI love how Russia has mastered the art of Godwin, even to the point of accusing victims of Nazism for allowing Nazism in the first place.",

        "text": "This comparison seems to be made from time to time, for some reason. Just a quick example from Dan Carlin, but I am not trying to single him out. He isn't the first or the last to make this comparison:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgoGqbm1pT0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgoGqbm1pT0)\n\nAlexander and Hitler's motivations were quite different. Alexander had a couple of reasons for going east, one was 'Greek Revenge' against the Persians from their years of threatening Greece, even going so far as to burn Athens. Another was the need to top his father in terms of glory and prestige. \n\nHitler's motivation was different. While \"revenge\" did play a role, he had a grander plan at the start, of expansion east and *Lebensraum* for the German people. He had dreams for an empire but not in the same way. A much more sinister way. His plan involved the depopulation of natives, and their replacement with German colonists.\n\nAlexander entered many places as a conquering hero, in already Greek cities restoring something of a democracy (though leaving Macedonians to supervise). He took Egypt recognized as a liberator from the Persians. \n\nBut Alexander, as he conquered, was hardly a Teddy bear, true. He was ruthless if you resisted him vigorously, or much at all--the sieges of Tyre and Gaza are evidence of this, where he killed all the men of age to fight and enslaved the women and children. Or at Multan, where his army killed every person in the town because Alexander had been wounded badly. Then there is the case of Persepolis (which had opened its gates to him and submitted to his kingship), where Alexander apparently allowed his soldiers to \"take their revenge\" in the heart of the Persian Empire by burning and looting.\n\nStill, this isn't like Hitler. Alexander had not embarked on a vast campaign of racial purification and replacement. Quite the opposite--he had wanted to integrate the cultures. He undertook Persian kings traditions and recruited Persians into his army as equals. At first, he mercifully reinstated Darius III's local governors even of the satraps to run the provinces he conquered.  Eventually, he recognized his entire Macedonian/Greek Army's concubines as legitimate wives. He married his inner circle and officer class to Persian women in an effort to integrate the two cultures. He recruited thousands of local Persians to be trained into the army in its Macedonian ways to be the future of the empire. \n\nThis racial mixing would have been absolutely abhorrent to Hitler, and this style of continued government and cultural fusion Alexander favored would have been unthinkable. \n\nNow we get to the Greeks calling Alexander a \"tyrant\". Perhaps he was to them. But really, his rule was not much more tyrannical, among the whole to the city states, than that of many others. Was Athenian rule, Spartan rule, or the rule of the Persians much more lenient? I would say no.\n\nedited: Accidentally typed 'Mahout' instead of 'Multan'. ",

I did that before I wrote up this thread.\n\nRule 5: This is bullshit.\n\nOur friend /u/TimONeill actually did an article for Quora a while back, [which later ended up on Slate magazine](http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/05/21/medieval_europe_why_was_water_the_most_popular_drink.html). The article opens with this paragraph:\n\n&gt; Contrary to what is found all over the Internet on the subject, the most common drink was water, for the obvious reason: It's free. Medieval villages and towns were built around sources of fresh water. This could be fresh running water, a spring or, in many cases, wells. All of these could easily provide fresh, disease- and impurity-free water; the idea that water from these sources would be the causes of disease and so had to be made into ale or beer is fanciful.\n\nThe idea that medieval people would be too stupid to figure out how to boil water ~~to get rid of bacteria~~ [that smelled rancid and might make them sick](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/256kdh/a_thread_in_rtodayilearned_claims_that_during/che8r7k) is ridiculous. Medieval people weren't stupid enough to build their cities near polluted water. Plus, they had protocols to keep pollutants from their water:\n\n&gt; Where water was more likely to be contaminated, largely by tanning, slaughtering, or dying facilities, was in larger towns. But since medieval people were not idiots, they dealt with this in several ways. There were ordinances on where tanners and dyers could operate so that water for domestic use could be drawn from rivers and streams in the town to ensure the water was clean. And there were fines for contaminating areas of streams used for household consumption.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that they didn't drink a lot of beer. They did, but for different reasons:\n\n&gt; People did drink a lot of ale and beer, but not because their water was so bad. The brews in question were much weaker than their modern equivalents but had the effect of providing much-needed calories to laborers and farmers, as well as being thirst-quenching and re-hydrating in hot weather or when working hard and losing sweat. Given the long days medieval workers put in, ale and beer were a major and necessary part of a laborer's daily energy intake. This should be seen as something like the medieval equivalent of drinking Gatorade.\n\nEdit: I totally fucked up and forgot that medieval people would not know about bacteria. GOD DAMN IT. Fixed.",

And when they went and created this document, that inspiration was included in these documents. That's how come it's an inspired document.\n\nThe Constitution was a secular constitution inspired by various constitutions like The Mayflower Compact, The Medina Constitution, The Magna Carta, The Iroquois constitution and much more. Sure, most of the signitaries were Christian but secularism was a key in it (The First Amendment prohibits Congress from establishing a religion and protecting the right to free exercise of religion)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZByJ5z0LaLs\n\n&gt;All of our government problems can be solved by just following the Constitution of the United States. It's that great a document.\n\n&gt;And not only that, all of the problems of this world, other countries, and their domestic and their religious and their government problems and their battles between each other and all of that, can be really solved by following our Constitution.\n\n&gt;Our Constitution is based on ten things, and it's based on the Ten Commandments, most everything that was done in the Constitution follows that law, which would be our founding fathers' law, the Ten Commandments. And when we vary from that, then our Constitution becomes sort of worthless. And we as a nation have varied a long ways in our moral standards as far as upholding and sustaining not only the Ten Commandments but upholding and sustaining our Constitution.\n\nApparent Bundy was inspired by [W. Cleo Skousen](http://www.salon.com/2009/09/16/beck_skousen/), an unreconstructed racist and right-winger who believed the U.S. is \"a divine utopia that God established as the high-water mark of human civilization\".

        "text": "/r/TodayILearned is not the best forum for history, but as much as there may be misleading information for modern history, whenever  archaeology comes up it is frequently the absolute pits. Luckily, the topic de jour is not a circlejerk about how awesome treasure hunting is, but instead it is about a complex and difficult to interpret artefact that may have a great deal of significance (although not in the way people assume). The comment section is too scattered for me to choose a unified thread or come up with a fully R6 title, so instead I will just highlight some particularly egregious examples.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2512xy/til_an_ancient_wooden_tablet_found_in_greece/\n\nFirst off, what is the Dispilio Tablet? It is a remain from the wonderful Neolithic site of Dispilio in northern Greece, where sedimentation from the lake created an anoxic environment which, to an archaeologist, means the possibility to find remains of wood, cloth, and other perishable materials. This is very exciting because the majority of items a given settlement will use will tend to be perishable, and information about these is entirely lost without extraordinary preservation conditions. From this site, one of the remains is a wooden tablet which contained a set of [symbols](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aydwGBvQrpc/UAbOOAXDPxI/AAAAAAAAbME/_toeiJ94eOQ/s320/Dispilio_tablet_text.png) that seem to be a form or proto-writing. The difference between proto-writing and writing is that while the former encodes information, the latter encodes language. Think of something along the lines of heraldry, in which the arrangement of iconographic elements can communicate complex information, but you can't ask for a cup of coffee with it. There are several examples from around the world, perhaps the most significant being the [Vinca symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_European_script) from Hungary and Romania and the Jiahu symbols from China. Both of these are extraordinarily old (~6000-5000 BCE) and, crucially, there are multiple examples of each. So we can see that the Dispilio tablet fits into an understood framework in a way that is extremely interesting but requires some nuance. You may imagine the result.\n\n&gt;TIL An ancient wooden tablet found in Greece, contradicts the belief that alphabet originated from Sumerians at 3000-4000 BC. The tablet dating at 5260 BC about to change the origin of alphabet in Europe entirely.\n\nWell, no. The alphabet originated from Semitic speakers in the Levant, although it could be argued that only with the Greek addition of vowels that it became a true phonetic alphabet. Furthermore, this doesn't change our understanding of the development of the alphabet. This is a single find from about 5000 BCE. There is no evidence that it continued in use, and besides, between Dispilio and the alphabet there is the Linear B script. Also worth noting, the people at the time were almost certainly no speaking Greek.\n\nNow after the wonderful top comment:\n\n&gt;You TIL'd a lot of things that aren't in the article.\n\nThere are several responses, including a link to [this article](http://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2012/07/prehistorc-tablet-calls-into-question.html#.U2uZZfldUrV), which contains the following statement:\n\n&gt;The currently accepted historic theory taught around the world suggests that the ancient Greeks learned to write around 800 BC from the Phoenicians. However, a question emerges among scholars: how is it possible for the Greek language to have 800,000 word entries, ranking first among all known languages in the world, while the second next has only 250,000 word entries? How is it possible for the Homeric Poems to have been produced at about 800 BC, which is just when the ancient Greeks learned to write? It would be impossible for the ancient Greeks to write these poetic works without having had a history of writing of at least 10,000 years back, according to a US linguistic research.  \n\nWhich I admit is a pretty tasty word Greek salad. Farther down the thread we get a bit of clear headed speculation as to the significance of the tablets:\n\n&gt;...next it is in Europe, that could mean a mesopotamian brought it with him, maybe Doggerland was the real Atlantis and it's a remnant of Atlantean text....What is certain is the oldest form of writing was found in Europe, meaning someone who likely lived and reproduced in Europe developed and knew how to interpret writing before the Mesopotamians, Indus Valley, Nilotic-Egyptian, and and Chinese. Supposedly\n\nWell, I mean, first off the Jiahu symbols are older by about a millenium. But I really wanted to highlight the wonderful way that Doggerland-Atlantis got shoved into this. R5: Atlantis is not real, and if it were, it would not be a Mesolithic North Sea landscape drowned by the receding ice shelf. Now, to a new chain:\n\n&gt; both Greek people and tourists tend to neglect the paleolithic era and dont quite understand its importance...They had the world's most ancient boat...But then, people rode all the way to Iran, exchanged exotic stuff with exotic stuff and brougt them back home and vice versa.\n\nA bit of overenthusiasm. Firstly, the site is Neolithic, not Paleolithic. This seems quibbly, but the Neolithic is defined by the introduction of agriculture, meaning that it is very hard to find a more fundamental distinction in the human condition. The second claim introduces a very fundamental claim in archaeology: the difference between what was, and what we have found. The oldest positive evidence of human intentional maritime voyaging is the crossing between [Sundaland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundaland) and [Sahul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahul_Shelf) (basically, the crossing to Papua and Australia). We know this indirectly: Australia has been inhabited fro about 50,000 years and we are pretty sure people didn't get their by swimming. Dispilio may have the oldest *surviving* boat, I'm not sure, but it certainly isn't the oldest full stop. The last sentence is a further misunderstanding of exchange networks: for a piece of Mesopotamian material to get to Greece, there doesn't need to be a single person who travels from Thessoloniki to Basra and back, as it can move through multiple stages of exchange. There *may* have been a single intrepid voyager, but there is certainly no *proof*.\n\n&gt;I'm always amazed how much further back we push back the start of human civilization and how much we will never really know. I wonder if 5 thousand years from now, when a civilization finds a frame of a car in some tar pit if they'll be as baffled as we are about ancient people. Assyrians had amazing architecture but where did that knowledge come from? You can keep tracing further and further back but there is a wall we inevitably hit until we uncover something else.\n\nAnd to send us off, another very important fundamental distinction in archaeology: the difference between what you (general you, not *you* you, you goof), a dude on the internet who hasn't read on the topic, who isn't familiar with the field, who doesn't have a grasp on the scholarship, who has not studied archaeology, knows, and what the academic community *in toto* knows.",

That's gonna suck.\" \n\nThough we may be straying into some sort of mythological subreddit that doesn't exist yet like /r/badsociology, but this is some damn bad sociology. Just because parents will encounter challenges in raising a child does not preclude them from raising their child or reproducing. Almost every parent encounters difficulty and challenges, some are just more challenging than others. Poverty, single parents, homosexual parents, depressed parents, parents with a criminal past, and so on will all encounter difficulties due to either internal or external sources. A child with homosexual parents may have a childhood that will \"suck\" due to bullying and possible social outcast status. This is less true than it was in the past fortunately. That doesn't mean those parents shouldn't be allowed to have a child. There are existing laws to protect children, and if you can have a child in a challenging lifestyle and do not run afoul those laws the State feels you should be allowed to continue to raise the child. I won't be addressing the effectiveness of child protection laws here, that's a different topic. \n\n**BACK TO HISTORY**\n\nUser /u/Voduar drops the proverbial bomb 'If WW2 had been justified by the economic concerns that caused it rather than the Nazis, then we wouldn't be asking \"Should two retarded people reproduce?\"' \n\nThis is some damn bad history. \n\nThe justification for World War two was never about anti-eugenics or pro-eugenics. Though related conflicts had been going on in Asia and Africa for a long time due to Imperial Japanese and Italian conquests, the official ribbon cutting wasn't done until September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. \n\nAmericans were aware of Hitler's plans to exterminate Jewish people before the war. He talked about it all the time, and even wrote about it in a little book you might have heard of called *Mein Kampf*. What wasn't known until 1942 was that Hitler actually was mass exterminating Jewish people. The resettlement and laws restricting the lives of Jewish people was not unknown, but people didn't know how far he had gone until people started escaping the camps and spreading information. \n\nThere are a few key facts that dispute /u/Voduar's statements\n\n1) The American government actually explicitly refused to release the information they had about the gassing of Jewish people because they did not want the American public to think the war was about helping the Jews. \n\n2) The information related to the actual extermination going ahead did not come to light until 1942, **after** American had already declared war on the Axis powers. \n\n3) America sat back and watch the war in Europe without direct intervention for over two years. It was only when they were directly attacked by Japan that they joined the fray.\n\nLater in 1942 a joint declaration was made by the Allied powers, that Hitler was attempting to exterminate the Jewish race. Even then most people found the news difficult to believe and papers were reluctant to publish much information about it. \n\nThe short of it that anti-eugenics was never a justification for World War 2, and eugenics isn't what started World War 2. Economic concerns were, actually, one of the big reasons for the start of the war. The Japanese Empire's expansion was economically driven, the Italian Empire's expansion was economic, and so was Germany's. There were certainly nationalistic and racist motivators involved in each country's invasions as well. \n\nThis isn't to say that eugenics and genocide are horrible. They definitely are! But it is some hardcore presentism to think that eugenics was the justification for World War 2. ",

Then the Victorians would not be caught dead wearing their undergarments outside their regular clothes either. \n\nPart of the confusion came from the Renaissance (don't get me started on shit people wear to Renaissance Fairs) to Rococo era where some women wore [conical shaped bodice](http://www.tomecek.com/jay/WomenClothing.gif) that might include lacing (particularly among [peasant women](http://173.254.28.123/~trishstu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bruegelhaymaking1.jpg)), boning, and a general appearance of a corset (up until the 1800's, they were called *stays* instead of corsets). \n\nAnother confusion came from Swiss Waists that are popular in the 1860's and again in the 1880's. A Swiss waist is a boned, pointed underbust garment worn over skirts and blouses or dresses.  Unlike a corset, a Swiss waist is never fastens with a metal front busk and it doesn't have obvious channels for boning. Essentially it's a wide belt (sometimes with shoulder straps) with lacings and hidden bonings. [Here's Empress Elisabeth](http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/9881/kaiserinelisabethvonoes.jpg) wearing a Swiss Waist. Swiss Waist can be so wide that to modern eyes they might be mistaken for a corset, as [seen here in a Sargent painting](http://www.oilpaintingart.us/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/r/mrs-wilton-phipps.jpg), but since it doesn't have a metal busk or visible boning channel, it's not a corset. \n\nIn addition, steampunk fashion has certainly influenced bad fashion history as well. Nothing wrong with doing it for the aesthetic, but they have almost no historical basis, they are \"Victorian-influenced\" at best. \n",

As in any parliamentary system, the top party rarely ever gets the \"majority of the vote\" unlike in America where we have only two strong parties in presidential elections. Hitler's party was the top one, and the Enabling Act was supported by other parties that enabled him to create a dictatorship. Only the SPDS and Communists opposed that.\n\n[Here is the comment thread it's from.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/24ywgz/til_that_mussolini_was_expelled_from_school_when/chcacw5?context=4)\n\nIt's *very* relevant that the Nazi party abused and manipulated the parliamentary system to bully their way into power. No one here said that the Germans were totally innocent - the Nazis never would have been able to abuse the political system if they hadn't had some minor electoral success to begin with. Hitler was part of a coalition in power, and got to that position through some very dishonest tactics. Still, they had pull because they were willing to use force against their enemies and could mobilize large groups. For these reasons, the president appointed Hitler the chancellor, and from there the Nazis kept pushing to gain every bit of power they could, legitimately or otherwise. By the time Hitler became dictator, the Nazis had already been throwing their weight around and abusing the system. It's pretty disingenuous to act as if the Enabling Act was a legitimate part of the parliamentary democratic system.\n\n**edit:** Further down the chain he actually tries to argue that the Nazis were *not* guilty of massive intimidation, attacks on political enemies, and general dickishness to take power.

He butchered an entire generation all for a Federal power grab. This man would have made satan proud.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/24v28v/tell_me_one_thing_the_democrats_have_done_for/chb66t9)\n\n“Federal power grab”? *Literally* Hitler? Yikes.\n\nSo starts a comment thread in /r/Conservative. The user then goes on to justify why they considered Lincoln to be America’s Hitler:\n\nClaim 2: \n&gt; The Civil War never needed to happen. Even if it didn't occur and there was a rift that may have happened, I firmly believe that the USA would have reunified within several decades.\n\n&gt; And I will call lincoln Hitler. When you're responsible for more Americans dieing than even Hitler in WW2, you ARE a hitler! \n\n&gt; - US Deaths Civil War: 750,000 (i've seen numbers that put this into 1 million)\n&gt; - US Deaths WW2: 400,000\n\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war\n\n\n&gt; **TL;dr** lincoln is better at killing americans than hitler\n\n-\nClaim 3:\n&gt; I don't really care about others. I care about Americans dieing.\n\n&gt; So it is fair. We're talking about American deaths. It's fair to blame lincoln when lincoln refused peace. He demanded war. Those deaths are purely on his bloody bloody hands.\n\n&gt; lincoln deserves infamy the same as stalin, mao, and hitler.\n\n-\nClaim 4:\n&gt; Except Lincoln didn't care about the slaves at all. He only freed them so they would rebel against the South and come join the Union army. He never even freed the Northern slaves until years later.\n\n&gt; Funny how so few people know the truth that freeing the slaves was merely a tactical weapon, nothing more. When he realized he'd be viewed as a hypocrite if he didn't free the slaves in the North he freed them at his convenience. \n\n&gt; Nearly a million people did not have to die to free the slaves. All the Federal government had to do was buy every single slave, free them, and then not allow new slaves. This is how many other nations ended the practice of slavery without civil war.\n\nR5:\n\nFirst off, let me make this clear: Lincoln is not Hitler. Lincoln did not have a plan of systematically exterminating undesirables such as Jews, homosexuals, Poles, communists, the disabled, and the like. Lincoln did not try to conquer Poland. Etc, etc. It’s honestly quite dumb.\n\nThe user argues that Lincoln committed genocide because he was killing Americans. [The United Nations defines the act of genocide as](http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf)\n\n&gt; any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group\n\nNow, I don't intend to get into Genocide Olympics, and so I’m going to skirt away from the numbers and focus on the \"intent to destroy\" part. \n\nSo did Lincoln want to start the Civil War?\n\nDuring the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln had this to say in regards to the institution of slavery:\n\n&gt; I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\n\nIn [his first inaugural address](http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html), Lincoln refers back to this quote as he addresses the secession of the Southern states; by this point of time, Jefferson Davis has been inaugurated as the president of the Confederacy two weeks earlier. \n\n&gt; It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or States against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\n\n&gt; I therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws the Union is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability, I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part, and I shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself.\n\n&gt; **In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority.** The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the Government and to collect the duties and imposts; **but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.** Where hostility to the United States in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object. While the strict legal right may exist in the Government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices.\n\n&gt; […]\n\n&gt; **In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government, while I shall have the most solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend it.\"**\n\nEmphasis mine. \n\nFrom this inaugural speech, there is no way that you can argue that Lincoln wanted to start the Civil War. It’s very clear that Lincoln wanted to preserve the Union, and that he’d only go towards bloodshed and violence in order to uphold it.\n\nNow, the user tries to argue that war would have not been necessary. Here’s the problem:\n\n1. First off, the Southern states were in rebellion. They seceded after Lincoln was elected because they thought that Lincoln was going to take away their slaves. You could totally justify going to war for that. But he didn’t—his first inaugural address shows that. So what did push them into war?\n2. [Fort Sumter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter). Frankly, you would be fucking idiotic if you didn't declare war *after the Confederacy just launched rockets against Union soil*. If having people attacking your freaking military fort on your own soil isn't enough to declare war, what is?\n\nFinally, the claim on whether Lincoln cared about the slaves.\n\nIt is true that Lincoln did say that if he could preserve the Union without freeing a slave, he would. But [he was personally opposed to slavery](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ysnbq/why_was_the_south_so_antilincoln/c5yjc0q). \n\nAccording to /u/Irishfafnir, [the Emancipation Proclamation was ~~more of a propaganda move~~ **mostly a piece of propaganda**](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ynqn9/the_us_civil_war_where_to_begin/c5x96cl):\n\n&gt; The war started to preserve the Union, even Lincoln himself had said that if he could end the rebellion without freeing one slave he would. As the war progressed he decided to free the slaves under SOUTHERN occupation. The proclamation in and of itself freed no slaves in border states that had stayed in the Union. It was mostly a powerful piece of propaganda\n\nso I'll grant the user that. [But even then, there was previous government efforts in emancipation; for example, the US government banned slavery from government territories present and future, and overturned the Dred Scott decision that had prevented Congress from regulating slavery.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation#Background)\n\nTo say that Lincoln didn't care about the slaves? Yeah, no.\n\n[Lincoln would live to see the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment in both houses before his assassination.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) However, he would not live to see it implemented in the states.\n\nThere's probably more that I can pick with this user’s claims, but I'm worried about violating the Genocide Olympics moratorium and I don’t want to make bad history claims myself. If anyone more knowledgeable than me can go over this and correct me if I made mistakes, go for it.\n\nEdit: added more stuff to the Emancipation Proclamation part, added background.",

        "text": "So they just released the new list of defaults, and look and see, /r/history is now a default. So I guess it's time to look at their front page, where currently only roughly half of the submissions have greater than 10 score, and look at some of the \"not historic enough for /r/AskHistorians posts\" \n\nWell, Here we go!\n\nFirst up, someone asks, [\"How did we strategically win World War II?\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/24xmeg/how_did_we_strategically_win_world_war_ii/)\n\nNote that this selfpost actually has a negative score, but it's still on the frontpage for some reason. The OP asks about both tactics and strategy as if they are interchangable, and the top poster calls him out. However, the second highest comment, sitting at 3 upvotes, says :\n&gt;On the battlefield, the Germans were superior just look at Field Marshal Rommel. It was bad decisions made at the top that ultimately cost them the war. For example, had Hitler not ordered the Blitz on London and kept on bombing the airfields, Britain would not have won the Battle of Britain. They had superior technology and numbers in that instance. Up until then, Germany had Britain on the back foot as a result of their original strategy.\n\n&gt;I can't speak much for the war in the far east, but from what I've read the Japanese were far superior especially at the start of the war. Hence why it is largely ignored in the UK.\n\n&gt;It is difficult to answer your question because the allies were fighting on different fronts, against different people and so needed to adopt different tactics in fighting the enemy forces.\n\nR5: If the Japanese were far superior, they would have won. Saying that the Japanese seemed to be winning in the beginning of the war is not false, but the battle of midway occurs in early June of 1942, only seven months after Pearl Harbor, and from there, it's a slow and steady decline for the Japanese until they surrender around 3 years later. Also, Rommel was not  the god of warfare. It's ridiculous to argue that if the Nazi leadership had been better, people like Rommel would have won Europe. \n\nLet's look at all the things Rommel didn't win that were pretty important:\n\n* Second Battle of El Alamain\n* Tobruk\n* Alam El Hafa\n* The North African campaign in general\n* The Normandy Invasion\n\nNow of course, much of this is not directly the fault of Rommel's leadership, but to use Rommel as an example of the Nazi military's domination of the allies is silly. He did not dominate the allies. Continuing, he talks about the Nazis losing the battle of Britain because they didn't stop bombing airfields, and that they would have won the Battle of Britain otherwise. This is extremely debatable for a lot of reasons. For one, the initial attacks in London, [Operation Loge,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz#Loge_and_Seeschlange) did huge damage to the Port of London. Also, the Battle of Britain would have been extremely difficult to win no matter what. It is very difficult to wage a war on a country entirely through the air, especially when you are separated by a body of water, which gives you even less flight time to work with. Also, I like how the Eastern Front of Europe is completely ignored. \nIn short, the Axis were not the superior side in WWII.\nAlso, he later defends his stance on Rommel despite all of Rommel's defeats by saying:\n&gt;How about the Rommel who knew that Germany could never win the war with Hitler as Fuhrer?\n\nWise Mr. Rommel, Fighting a war he knew was lost. That's what makes someone the best military leader in the business!\n\nIn fact, I raged about this comment for so long, I didn't realize that the entire thread was a slew of Axis apologists who thought that the Allies somehow won the war through a deal with the devil!\n\nThings I don't really care to address, mostly because I refuted the ideas higher up there, but are still fun to read:\n&gt;America had more bodies and no local enemies to blow up our factories. American cranked out more tons of steel, ships, planes, guns, bullets, food.\nMeanwhile, the USSR was doing all the real fighting with a smaller, less modern economy and waves and waves of cannon fodder.\n\n\"US don't real fighting everyone! The Western front was a meaningless charade!\"\n\n&gt;The allies were no where near as good as German and Japanese forces but we did have the Russian numerical advantage.\n\nPeople truly forget to factor in the huge role Russian cannon fodder played in the Pacific theater. In fact, If you look at the battle of Midway, the battle of Guadalcanal, the battle of Iwo Jima, and basically everything ever fought in the Pacific during WWII, the Russians were nowhere to be seen. Stalin's invisible hand guided the worthless US Navy(which, by the way, was the largest in the world) to victory.\n\n\n Moving on, now we go into [an  actually large thread about the Hindenburg.](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/24v27u/the_hindenburg_burst_into_flames_killing_36/)\n\nSomeone gets angry about how the Hindenburg disaster turned people off from airship travel. \n\n&gt;It always annoys me that a viable form of transport has been haunted by a \"disaster\" that killed hardly anyone.\nMore people die every day in road accidents.\n\nFirst of all, comparing the death count of the Hindenburg, which happened 77 years ago, to the death count of car crashes today is presentism. There happen to be a much larger amount of both people and cars today then  there were in the time of the Hindenburg. Also, losing a third of the airship's passengers during what seemed to be a normal docking is not a very compelling argument of safety. I'm not entirely sure how viable a thing like the Hindenburg even was. Filling it with helium would have been extremely expensive, hydrogen was clearly a bad decision, and airplanes would quickly become much more useful for almost everything. There's a reason that even today, despite our ability to make perfectly safe helium airships, most people only think of the Goodyear Blimp when they talk about modern airships. It's because they are not as useful as airplanes for most things.\n\n[A clever analysis by the show archer of why airships aren't very viable as transportation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq-N3_plNq8)\n\nI'm basically done, but in short, it seems /r/history's ascendance to the status of default sub will make the volcano runneth over with bad history.

So, there's a guy out in Utah who does religious art, and he painted [this masterpiece](http://jonmcnaughton.com/content/ZoomDetailPages/OneNationUnderGod.html), entitled *One Nation Under God*. It depicts Jesus holding the U.S. Constitution, backed up by various figures from American history, with the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court buildings in the background. In the foreground are two groups, Good Guys (on the left) and Bad Guys (on the right). The good guys include a mother with a disabled child, a U.S. Marine, a business women, and a college student (more on him in a moment, he is the focus of my Rule 5 explanation below), while the bad guys include an ashamed Supreme Court justice, Mr. Hollywood, a liberal professor holding Darwin's *On the Origin of Species*, and my personal favorite, the crooked lawyer, counting out his massive stacks of $100 bills from bilking his clients. \n\n(I've been out of law school for two years now. Where are *my* massive stacks of Benjamins!?)\n\nThere's one Good Guy on the left, too, the pregnant lady. Not sure why she's with the rest of those evil yahoos! And, hey, we see the Army, Marines, and Air Force represented, but where's the Navy!? They know about the U.S. Navy in Utah, right?\n\nI mean, at first blush, it's a bit pompous, but pretty innocuous as far as these things go. He actually does put a pretty good selection of Americans on there. The guy gives glowing praise to the Founding Fathers, American military personnel, several U.S. Presidents, people who fought for civil rights, abolitionists, and even Christa McAuliffe (and I'll admit I thought it was very cool to have her in it). \n\nBut the thing that got me, and prompted me to make this post, was the college student. He's holding what the artist says in the caption is \"the most important book about why America is so great.\" It's *The Five Thousand Year Leap* by Cleon Skousen. \n\nWritten by a former FBI agent and hardcore anti-Communist, *The Five Thousand Year Leap* is a loving tribute to the devoutly Christian anarcho-capitalist libertarian Small-Government Republic our Founding Fathers created under the direct guidance of God (basing the Constitution mostly off of the Holy Bible), without which the world would be still be composed of ignorant peasants scrabbling in the dirt just to feed themselves. Because of America, Skousen argues, to quote [Wikipedia,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Thousand_Year_Leap) \"more progress [has] been achieved in the last 200 years than in the previous 5,000 years of every other civilization combined.\" He lays out [28 alleged principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Thousand_Year_Leap#Premise) upon which the Founding Fathers based our great Christian Republic. \n\nNow for the Rule 5:\n\nThat book is a bunch of horse hockey, straight from the [Third Circle](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/history_hell#wiki_the_third_circle) of History Hell. No, more progress has not been achieved in the past 200 years than in the past 5,000 of every other civilization combined, unless by \"progress\" you mean \"certain scientific and technological developments.\" And of course it wasn't the American Revolution that caused all that sweet, sweet progress. \n\nNo, the Founding Fathers were not some divinely-inspired united body of men with a singular vision for a great Christian nation (has he ever actually *read* James' Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention? Or the Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist arguments?). And, no, they weren't all small-government, anti-tax libertarians. Hamilton and Madison, for instance, both thought a strong central government was necessary. Jefferson thought the rich should be taxed much more highly than the common working folk. \n\nThe New Yorker had a nice little disassembly of Skousen and his writings a few years back, in [this article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/18/101018fa_fact_wilentz) by Sean Wilentz (the article is about the Cold War origins of the Tea Party; it's biased, of course, but a good read). From the article, a bit of background on the man:\n\n&gt;Skousen was considered so radical in the early nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover’s F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted that “during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing ‘professional communists’ who are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes.” Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I., from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he had served as Hoover’s administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.\n\nBecause if *J. Edgar Hoover* thought you were too radical an anti-communist, that's not a good sign. \n\nAnyway, that's my little contribution to the sub today. Oh, and I especially liked the (Asian or Hispanic?) immigrant in the bottom left who is shocked when he realizes that Jesus gave us the Constitution. Or something. Haha.  ",

Firstly it seems extremely unlikely that the Gospel of Barnabas is 1500 years old as the article claims for several reasons.  The first known manuscripts of the Gospel of Barnabas come from late 16th Century Italy and Spain, 1000 years later than claimed.  If this is not a forgery, it means that a continuous written tradition existed for the heretic Gospel of Barnabas throughout over 1000 years over several different languages and national borders, without being noticed by any other contemporary sources in this time.  Furthermore, if this is truly 1500 years old, then it should proven Islam is the one true religion because the Gospel of Barnabas predicts the coming of Muhammad right down to the name, who would have come 100-200 years later in the 7th century.\n\nBiblical Scholar Dr. Timothy Michael Law, who has a doctorate from Oxford, has already made a [skeptical post](http://www.timothymichaellaw.com/not-a-1500-year-old-bible-in-turkey/) on the manuscript.\n\n&gt;I just spoke with my colleague about this, and after both of us have had the chance to look at it we concur it is impossible this is a 1500 year old Bible. What could be really funny is that at the bottom it appears to read something like 1500 AD. It is admittedly tough to read, but it would quite a mistake to claim it is 1500 years old when it was produced in 1500. This date would also conform to what most scholarship believes anyway, that this gospel was produced around this time.\n\nConsidering the later 16th Century manuscripts in Spain and Italy, this would be the most likely case if this bible is not a forgery.\n\nHowever there is still other badhistory in this article.  It slings out the tired tripe about the Biblical canon being \"handpicked\" at the Council of Nicea in an attempt to give some historical credence to the Gospel of Barnabas.  As many others have said before, the Council of Nicea was not about the canon of the Bible, but about the divine nature of Christ and the creation of the Nicene creed.  A rough biblical canon was already established approximately a century beforehand by Origen (although he was later condemned in 553 AD).  \n\nTo the article's credit it does warn readers away from being \"I told you so\", but even that disclaimer still implies a belief that this is a ground-breaking discovery.

He's also a revisionist who claims capitalists \"revised\" German history just as it did to Hawai'i, and there's a new world order destroying Syria.  Or something.\n\nLet me ease you into his rants; they're non-reddit:\n\nPre-rant minibonus: \n\n&gt;Lol history will be written by the victors. Nationalism is rising. \n\nMoving on to the first segment segment, I present to you this:\n\n&gt;I never heard of a Napoleon of Alabama. Kamehameha was the Napoleon of the Pacific. Wasnt Alabama just a plot of land that was bought by the US or something? \n\n.....  \n\n&gt;im guessing the netherlands is a little bigger than Hawaii? So we probably had an empire that big in the pacific.  \n\nR5: Kamehameha (referring to the First here) was maybe Napoleon of the core Hawai'ian islands.  He did not conquer the Pacific, Polynesia was not the Hawai'ian empire, and and much of his fleet was foreign.\n\nBut the real meat starts here.  You can see he's a revisionist who doesn't know much about history (hawaii having a large empire, that victor guy, etc).  Let's jump into the crazy:\n\n&gt;our palace had electricity before the White House, and we also had the highest literacy rate in the world. It is reasonable to infer from this we were a far more advanced society and may have developed technologies sooner much like Germany developed Rocketry (V-bombs, etc) that were later utilized by America and Russia during the cold war.\n\nR5: There's no evidence Hawai'i invented the V bombs.  At all.  Period.  End of discussion.  They were designed in the late 30s in Nazi Germany.  There is also no way to prove the claim they had the highest literacy rate in the world (only proof I've seen are from HAWAII STRONK nationalist cites) especially considering it's a time frame of decades he's referring to.  They also didn't invent electricity or develop it faster - they just wired a single building before the white house was.\n\n&gt;Up next:\n\nhttp://www.jahwarriors.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Hawaiian-dreadnoughts.jpg\n\nR5: I'm not a big fan of military history, but I know a few things.  For one, Dreadnaught-type battleships were not developed until the 20th century; in fact, they type before them were called *pre-dreadnoughts* (at least now they are) and even then, *those* weren't made until 30 years after 1850, the time period he claims they were built.  Someone came out and asked if these ships were built why is there no record of them ever existing?\n\n&gt;My current line of thinking is that these dreadnoughts were developed ahead of their time and seized by the US navy later, and with retrofits and upgrades could have been reintroduced into service with World War I happening a couple decades after the Overthrow. Why did the plantation regime go through such lengths to eliminate the Hawaiian language and many of our records? There must have been a coverup due to the fact that Hawaii was the most advanced society in the world, with electricity and the highest literacy rate in the world, in our own language.\n\nR5: Yes, the island chain of Hawai'i had the resources, industry, and scientific collective knowledge to build Dreadnought battleships in the 1850s, only to be overthown by plantation owners without ever having used them or written records; the US then stole them and used them without record as well, because reasons.\n\nWhen someone wrote a post saying essentially the same thing I did (the ironclads were \"first\" steel ships, essentially), he responded with:\n\n&gt;Yeah yeah, those are all the first ships in bourgeoisie history books. Kind of hard to know what was achieved when cultural genocide was committed and Hawaiians were killed off with disease and banning the language, destroying royal records, banning Hawaiian newspapers, disarming the people, stealing the land etc.\n\nSomeone then asked how Hawai'i would have able to afford it.  He responded with this nonsense:\n\n&gt;Hawaii's GDP in 2012 was about 70 billion. If a dreadnought cost 200 million in today's dollars, and the fully populated Hawaiian Kingdom of 1 million Hawaiians brought in half that (35 billion in today's money), 5 dreadnoughts could have been built in a year representing just a few percent of Hawaii's annual GDP.\n\nBut, Velociraptor!  What's this about wikipedia editing?\n\nHe went full history revisionist in March when he went from a slightly loony person (see: \"the man\" is keeping him down, he smokes a lot of pot, doesn't have a stable job, talks about \"oofing the females\" in half his conversations, etc) to HAWAI'I STRONK REMOVE WHITE MAN FROM PREMISES.  Coincidentally, Wikipedia was edited that made Hawai'i go from having almost no military to having the strongest navy in the world at the time, sixty years ahead of the rest of the world.  It also went from Hawai'i claiming uninhabited islands and relying on foreign powers for strength, to them singlehandedly beating an American invasion and signing a peace treaty for no reason.\n\nDon't believe me?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iq10h6d.png\n\nThere was an edit war, and then it ended up boiling down to this\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9KutYav.png\n\nNo source, anonymous edit.  In fact, the only other place I can find any information about it is on his website!  Which I'm not going to link here, because it's mostly conspiracy theories mixed in with bad history.\n\nShortly after he went public on some forum with this it was removed for vandalism.\n\nYou want to know what the best part is?  For all of his anti-west rants, for his diatribes against \"the west\" and \"the white man\", and modern society, the symbolism for his Hawai'ian nationalist group is the guys from 300 with some Hawai'ian colors mixed in.\n\nAnyway, that's all for now.

        "text": "I've been listening, as I imagine many of you have, to the latest Dan Carlin series about the First World War. While I'm sure there's bits of bad history littering around his narrative, and I always take his podcasts with a grain of salt (as you should too), some bad history regarding the Ottoman Empire really grated my nerves in the most recent episode, [Blueprint for Armageddon III](http://www.dancarlin.com//disp.php/hharchive/Show-52---Blueprint-for-Armageddon-III/World%20War%20One-Great%20War-history). And as I'm supposed to be studying the late Ottoman period for an exam, I consider this revision. It counts, right?\n\nBeginning from about 2:40, Dan Carlin describes the reasoning behind why the Gallipoli Campaign was begun by the British/French forces. \n\nHe characterises the British and French thinking as thus: \n\n&gt; Why don’t we go after the weak, the sick, the old [foe]? Instead of going after the strong, and young, and dangerous [foe]? And there was a country in the war now that met all three of those key classifications as a guy like Churchill would have made them. A country that was old, and sick, and weak. It was more than a country – it was an empire. It was a dying empire. **I’ve been calling it Turkey throughout this whole show because that’s the proper name for it in the first world war but there’s another proper name too that conjures up a whole different set of images than the perhaps modern sounding name of Turkey, and that’s the Ottoman Empire.**\n\n&gt; **And that conjures up images of Sultans, Janissaries, and Harems, and being on the gates of Vienna almost overrunning into central Europe at one point, at the height of their history.** Of knocking down the walls of Constantinople, formerly known as Byzantium to the Greeks and Constantinople to the Romans, and then, after the Sultan got through the historic barricade and conquered the city, he renamed it Istanbul, as sort of monument (sic) of what the Ottomans had achieved. But that was when the Ottomans were young, and the Ottomans were old now. And they were losing territory over the decades like nobody’s business. They were seen as a carcass to be picked at – as I say, the Sick Man of Europe, they were called. (emphasis mine)\n\nBut Turkey is not the proper name for that state yet. While in Britain and America it was common to call the Ottoman Empire Turkey during that time period, there was no formal state going by that name and wouldn’t be for another 9 years, when the Republic of Turkey was declared. It would be rendered history with the final abolition of the Caliphate in 1924 and the exiling of the Ottoman ex-royal family.  \n\nHe says that the term 'Ottoman Empire' conjures up certain images, which he uses to characterise it. The problem is that using the name ‘Turkey’ does too, but the associations we make from it are completely incorrect for the period being discussed. 'Turkey' suggests we are talking of a state which is a national homeland of the Turkish people. This is the connotation in mind when the nationalist leaders, led by Mustafa Kemal, took control of the country and rechristened it, but it was not then called that by the people of the Ottoman Empire itself. The Ottoman past was completely forsaken by Ataturk’s Turkey and it was perceived as a new slate.\n\nThe Sick Man of Europe narrative, which runs throughout this portion of the episode, is an old concept that’s been going out of fashion in the historiography of the 19th/20th century period of the empire for years now. Scholarship tends to focus on the ways in which the Ottoman government and Sultans of the 19th century into the Young Turk era adapted to the changing circumstances and attempted to modernise. I have some problems with it, but I’ll let it slide since we are talking about the Ottomans militarily now and the Eurocentric view may be granted, considering he is discussing British perceptions and reasoning for the offensive against them.\n\nHe continues: \n\n&gt; And someone like Churchill looked at Turkey just sitting there, they come into the war in November, several months after the war officially starts. And they’re surrounded by water, and they’re maybe not even a second-rate power but they’ve got the territory of a second-rate power. And they’ve got lots of people stuck in Turkey but not wanting to be in Turkey – that’s how an Arab might look at it, or a Kurd might look at it, or an Armenian might look at it. \n\nMy final problem here is this nationalist perspective Carlin presents of the Ottoman Empire, which was not as prominent as he makes it out to be (though that’s because most of the major nationalist minorities had already declared independence from the empire in the Balkans). In fact, prior to the First World War there wasn’t any prominent Arab or Kurdish interest in leaving the empire. Arab and Kurdish revolts and siding with the British – famously by the Hashemites but also occurring in the predominantly-Kurdish Mosul province – may never have occurred without a First World War. \n\nThe Young Turks, despite their name, were not Turkish nationalists when the secret society was founded – at least one of their most influential members, Abdullah Cevdet, was an ethnic Kurd for example. After the 1908 revolution and the Committee of Union and Progress’s rise to power this was beginning to change, however Ottomanism (the proto-nationalist marker which the state had endorsed to combat ethnic nationalism) was still strong. It was really during the First World War that Arab nationalism began to gain currency, and then still only amongst the elite and intelligentsia – it wasn’t until the 1920s that it began to be expanded upon and adopted by the masses. With the Kurds, there was even less nationalist feeling amongst them – Turkish/Arab domination in the 1920s and onwards would catalyse Kurdish nationalism, years after the First World War.\n\nJwaideh, Wadie. _The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development._ Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 2006.\n\nEppel, Michael. \"The Elite, the Effendiyya, and the Growth of Nationalism and Pan-Arabism in Hashemite Iraq, 1921–1958.\" _International Journal of Middle East Studies_ 30, no. 02 (1998): 227-250.\n\nSeale, Patrick. _The Struggle for Arab independence: Riad el-Solh and the Makers of the Modern Middle East._ Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Cevdet",

When I asked about what he meant, [his response](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/24swuj/til_the_original_screenplay_for_spielbergs/chaj7l3?context=3) was nothing short of a hit piece on Lincoln.\n\nWhy is it bad history? Because, for lack of a better word, it's bullshit. Point by point:\n\n1. There is no particular reason to believe that Abe Lincoln is a, \"unabashed white supremacist,\" much less that he openly claimed to be one. During the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln did say something to the effect of blacks being inferior to whites, and in post-war political maneuverings, Lincoln did advocate for blacks to get the vote starting on a limited basis with black Union soldiers, but these positions are likely politically motivated to tell the voters what they want to hear, and are contradicted by private statements by Lincoln.\n\n2. Is there *any* evidence that Lincoln enjoyed racist jokes? \n\n3. I've never heard the claim that Lincoln traded opium to get Southern cotton. Even if it were true, it wouldn't be Lincoln doing it, but either private companies not under Lincoln's purview or people in the government who did not answer anywhere close to anyone as high up as Lincoln. This guy seems to be portraying Lincoln as the Manuel Noriega of the 1860s, and there's no reason to believe that's true.\n\n4. Here, this guy criticizes Lincoln for signing the Emancipation Proclamation while criticizing him for being a white supremacist just a few points up. Apparently, Lincoln was a racist, but went against, \"Northern policies,\" to sign the Emancipation Proclamation, meaning he had neither personal nor political cause to do so? Sounds legit.\n\n5. Here, we have a three for one! While randomly snatching up blacks for petty crimes, convicting them, and sentencing them to work on plantations, and generally **not** on chain gangs, did happen, and was a big problem in the Reconstruction-era South, Lincoln's intent was obviously *not* to create a new form of slavery. Lincoln was not even alive for the adoption of the Amendment, having been killed by John Wilkes Booth eight months earlier, let alone for the rise of hard labor to replace slavery. Sherman also did not lead a, \"sanctioned burning of the South.\" If a push through enemy territory to destroy materiel is wrong, then so is practically every military action ever undertaken.\n\nEdit: changed borked formatting.",

Even a quick search on AskHistorians throws up [many](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wrrl3/why_were_the_americans_able_to_win_the/), [many](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16hatw/what_exactly_were_the_main_reasons_why_the/), reasons why the war panned out the way it did, but the fact that they were 'citizen soldiers' with access to firearms remains noticeably absent. Without knowing too much it appears that the common reasons given for the colonies' successes were\n\n&gt;A combination between distance from the British \"main base\", scope of the conflict, French military assistance, Washington's ability to preserve the army, and intelligent manipulation of propaganda and controlling the scope of the British war effort.\n\nIn another [comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16hatw/what_exactly_were_the_main_reasons_why_the/c7w2ddy), the concept of armed 'citizen soldiers' winning the war because of their access to weapons is raised and the argument is put forward that the specific weapons they utilised were important\n\n&gt;The Marquis de Lafayette and other Europeans helped train the American Army into a professional fighting force, and there were frontiersmen who were experts with the Pennsylvania (or Kentucky) long rifle. These weapons were accurate to distances of more than 200 yards, when muskets weren't good for half of that.\n\nbut again, I'm under the distinct impression the war was lost by the British for more reasons than simply the access to weapons of the colonists.\n\nPersonally I think this is bad history but I really don't know enough to refute or rebuttal this statement any further. Does it count as bad history if they are attempting to answer an ELI5 question with the sort of answer a 5 year old would give? Is this a common argument put forward by Americans in favour or in explanation of the 2nd Amendment?\n\nedit - rule 5 stuff!\n\nedit - Troublemaker here can't even read the sub-rules - direct quotes included to keep the peace!\n",

Discussions on how MRAs are never getting laid, whether women actually want to have dangerous jobs, and the like needs to go elsewhere. This is a historical discussion and I want to keep it that way.**\n\nFinally. Now instead of tangible comment karma, I can get non-existent self-post karma! HUZZAH!\n\n[\\*takes a dance break*](http://i.imgur.com/cXqdAk2.gif)\n\nNow then! Back to our regular programming!\n\nSo someone on AMR decided to go to DeviantART and search all images tagged MRA, and we had a discussion on how glorious the images are. One of the images tagged as MRA on DeviantART is [this](http://www.deviantart.com/art/Unpopular-opinions-feminism-307636786) travesty. Essentially, what the image does is to create a strawperson representing patriarchy theory… and with that, came up with some bad gender history. Specifically: no woman has ever worked in a factory, or in a dangerous job, ever.\n\nNow, this is total bullshit. Let me give you some examples:\n\n* First off, there was the [Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire) on 25 March 1911. It’s one of the most deadly industrial disasters in United States history, clocking in at #4 with 146 deaths. The victims? Mostly immigrant women.\n* Then we have the [Lowell Mill Girls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Mill_Girls). Lowell had opened a textile mill and employed mostly women to work the machines, which made deafening noises during operation and which spewed out particles of thread and cloth into the air. Lowell’s mills was the site of two strikes and eventually the location of the first women workers’ union: [the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Mill_Girls#Lowell_Female_Labor_Reform_Association).\n* Child labor was rather common in textile mills. [A quick Google image search turns up photographs of child laborers, both boys and girls, operating machinery in the textile mill and other places.](https://www.google.com/search?q=child+labor+textile+mills&amp;rlz=1C1PRFA_enUS435US436&amp;es_sm=122&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RQRnU7uKLI3coAS7iICgCg&amp;ved=0CCcQsAQ&amp;biw=1213&amp;bih=617)\n* World War 1. [In the UK, 80,000 women went out to serve as non-combatants in the battlefield, and millions more worked at home to support the war effort.](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1zynqo/on_the_role_of_women_in_world_war_one_or_white/) Prior to that, working class women had been working in the factories for years.\n\n[Textile mills weren’t all that safe either.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/textiles/background_conditions.shtml):\n\n&gt; The air in the cotton mills had to be kept hot and humid (65 to 80 degrees) to prevent the thread breaking.\n\n&gt; In such conditions it is not surprising that workers suffered from many illnesses. \n\n&gt; The air in the mill was thick with cotton dust which could lead to byssinosis - a lung disease.\n\n&gt; Although protective masks were introduced after the war, few workers wore them as they were made uncomfortable in the stifling conditions.\n\n&gt; Eye inflammation, deafness, tuberculosis, cancer of the mouth and of the groin (mule-spinners cancer) could also be attributed to the working conditions in the mills.\n\n&gt; Long hours, difficult working conditions and moving machinery proved a dangerous combination. Accidents were common and could range from the loss of a finger to fatality.\n\n[More information on the working conditions inside a textile mill.](http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-newsouth/5493)\n\nYeah, pretty sure that women have been doing dangerous work in factories for quite a while. As such, I call bullshit on that image.\n\nAlso! Quick story! My mother works as a seamstress, and has been doing it ever since before I was even born. One of her middle fingers has a nail that has been split into two and is effectively dead from her accidentally sewing it on a sewing machine once upon a time. When I was a wee baby, I stuck my left index finger into one of the moving parts and got my fingernail torn off; you can actually see the difference between that nail and my other nails, because it grew back in such a way that I have to trim it more often than my other nails. My mother often wore cloth over her nose because of all of the dust. Sometimes she would take my brother and I to the factory to pick up new work—she was a freelancer at the time. When you walked into the factory, you can smell the large amounts of dust in the air, and the whirring of sewing machines could be heard even in the car. Many of the women working there would wear dust masks due to all of the dust. \n\nSo honestly, the misogynistic bad gender historians can suck it.\n\nEdit: I mistyped my anecdote about my mother's nail and confused it for my own, which made it sound a lot worse than it actually was. Wow. Much fail. So terrible. My mother would not be proud. :P",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/24qq2u/on_the_anniversary_of_the_kent_state_shootings/",
        "text": "So we've got [this classic picture of Kent State.] (http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/24mlsw/mary_ann_vecchio_kneels_over_the_body_of_jeffrey/)\n\nBut of course, we cannot simply mourn the dead and agree that what happened at Kent State was terrible, that would be too reasonable.\n\nI know there's a moratorium on genocide olympics, but how about \"who killed the most protesters\" olympics?\n&gt;Ok, I'm gunna come off callous here but I don't get why we look back at the Kent State murders (or whatever the proper term is here) with such horror and disgust and not many people are familiar with incidents like the Ludlow Massacre or the Battle of Blair Mountain. Dead protestors are always a sad sight, don't get me wrong 4 dead is worlds worse than none, but in Ludlow the national guard killed a lot of people with machine guns and led raids on the striking workers camps to burn down their tent town. I guess it's more fresh in the public mind sure but no one these days seems to remember the swathes of martyrs there were for labor rights that many of us enjoy today.\n\nWhile the violence around unionizing workers and various strikebreaking groups like the pinkertons was completely horrific and also interesting, it is pretty easy to see why it is not as famous as Kent State. For one, a large amount of the population today was alive when Kent State happened. Also, it became a huge media topic, and is viewed as an iconic part of the anti-war movement during the Vietnam War. Most people don't learn about the defining moments in labor union history other than a few things, like the triangle shirtwaist fire. Also, as is often repeated, death count does not necessarily determine what events were worse or more memorable. Clearly Kent State still strikes a nerve with the public, whereas things like Ludlow, which were dark times concerning both evil businesses and unions, things which are becoming unpopular in many places, do not gather the same attention. \n\nAlso, let's add in a bit of \"the protesters were just asking to get shot!\"\n\n&gt;The students were attacking the soldiers with bottles and bricks. They got what they had coming to them.\n\n&gt;They were relatively poorly trained soldiers that had no idea what to do about a riot. I don't blame them for firing on the protesters that were throwing stuff at them\n\nAnd then, the guy who brought you the comments above feels the need to also justify the boston massacre, because why not?\n\n&gt;It is a tragedy but, you can't expect someone not to retaliate if you throw a rock at them. The response was a bit excessive, but I believe it was a heat of the moment thing like the Boston massacre was.\n\nSo R5: \nDirectly from Kent State Sociology's description of the events on May 4th: [\"Several Guardsmen could be seen huddling together, and some Guardsmen knelt and pointed their guns, but no weapons were shot at this time. The Guard then began retracing their steps from the practice football field back up Blanket Hill. As they arrived at the top of the hill, twenty-eight of the more than seventy Guardsmen turned suddenly and fired their rifles and pistols.\"](http://dept.kent.edu/sociology/lewis/lewihen.htm)\n\nThe National guard did not shoot in a \"heat of the moment event.\" They were not forced to shoot because of being pelted. They retreated up the hill before firing. To try to claim that the protesters were asking to get shot  is completely stupid. I know an argument can be made for the guards being in fear of their lives perhaps, but it was not some hair trigger occurence that happened when one person had a brick hurled at them, like the commenter is trying to imply. \n\nAlso, we gotta accuse the US government of being like China!\n\n&gt;looks like China isn't the only Nation whose ruling class will (and has) killed non violent student protesters.\n\nSo This guy is clearly referring to the Tienanmen Square protests, which is a completely ridiculous comparison. For one, the \"ruling class\" did not carry out Kent State. However, Tiannenmen Square was responded to with the declaration of martial law. I will also use [this image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/85/Tank_Man_Long_Shot_by_Stuart_Franklin.jpg) to say that comparing the military action at Kent State to that in Tienanmen Square is very silly. While Kent State is a dark blemish on America's history, it is not reasonable to use it to say \"the US is just as bad as China!\"\n\nI guess we can't just mourn the dead.",

Lincoln was always opposed to slavery, even before he became President. This is generally tied to the notion that Lincoln was pragmatic and wouldn't have pushed for the 14th and 15th Amendments (even though he said that he was for giving some blacks the right to vote)\n\n_______________________________________\n\nThe thread also contains the good ol' Robert E Lee opposed slavery. Again I will quote /u/smileyman. \n\n&gt;The statement that he was against slaves is probably best known from a [letter](http://fair-use.org/robert-e-lee/letter-to-his-wife-on-slavery) he wrote to his life where he said this:\n\n&gt;&gt;In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral &amp; political evil in any Country.\n\n&gt;On the face of it, that seems like a reasonable thing to say. However, it needs to be understood in the context of the time (and from his other writings). It was a fairly common opinion, which really meant that slavery would end when the Lord chose to end slavery, and until then it was natural and right for slavery to exist. \n\n&gt;In that same letter he also says this:\n\n&gt;&gt;I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, &amp; while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially &amp; physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, &amp; I hope will prepare &amp; lead them to better things.\n\n&gt;He also made some other arguments in that letter which really indicate his position on slavery.\n\n&gt;1.) Ending it can only come about through persuasion, not force.\n\n&gt;2.) Persuasion can take a long time. It took Christianity 2000 years to reach even as far as it has and look how many errors are still committed by Christians!\n\n&gt;3.) If abolitionists want to help the slave out, then they shouldn't anger the master. \n\n&gt;4.) Abolitionists should be patient with Providence\n\n&gt;5.) Interfering with slavery is like interfering with neighbors--nobody likes it. \n\n&gt;6.) Calls abolitionism an \"Evil Course\"\n\n&gt;7.) And has this gem about freedom of speech.\n\n&gt;&gt;Is it not strange that the descendants of those pilgrim fathers who Crossed the Atlantic to preserve their own freedom of opinion, have always proved themselves intolerant of the Spiritual liberty of others?\n\n&gt;(Never mind about the physical freedom of the slave. It's the spiritual freedom of the master to own slaves that's clearly important.)\n\n\n\n&gt;As for his feelings being strongly enlisted in behalf of the black man, his actions aren't.\n\n&gt;1.) He owned slaves (through his wife).\n\n&gt;2.) He rented his slaves out to other plantations, even breaking up families to do so\n\n&gt;3.) The terms of his father-in-law's will stated that the slaves were to be freed and that it was to be accomplished within 5 years. Lee took all of that 5 years and then tried to get the time extended by a court and was denied. Only then did he free them (and he had to do it.\n\n&gt;4.) Lee did nothing to stop Confederate soldiers from kidnapping free blacks and sending them back South to be sold. This was a common practice whenever Confederate soldiers moved into Union territory, and he did and said nothing to indicate disapproval.\n\n&gt;5.) He said he couldn't fight against friend and family, but of course he did end up fighting against friends who were from Virginia and served with the Union Army.\n\n\n",

He spent five minutes recently being very confused about the geography, linguistics, and ethnicities of the former Soviet union. He couldn't place the Crimea, didn't know Ukrainian was similar to Russian (This revelation led him to conclude that Russians and Ukrainians are in fact the same people), didn't know anything at all about Polish and thought it was non-indo-european, and so on.\n\nHe also handed out, as homework, an editorial captioned \"The Boil of Varberg\", about the Lenin-themed spa located there. Some months before that, he handed out a text about the Apparition of the Holy Virgin at Guadaloupe, whose only trait disqualifying it from being a Catholic tract was how terribly written it was.\n\nI have learned a lot about various misconceptions one can have from him, at least.

Currently sitting at [+1158] on the front page of /r/all, [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/61OvF.jpg) is meant to show how God's miracles have diminished in the face of human accomplishment. It is filled with horrible, horrible, horrible history.\n\nApparently in 4000 BCE, humans were apparently really, really, impressed with controlling fire. Considering the *homo erectus* began controlling fire around [790,000 years ago](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3670017.stm), the idea that 784,000 years from then, humans, with animal domestication, the rising of agriculture, and the beginning of the Bronze Age, would be so impressed by the idea of fire is ludicrous.\n\nAccording to this map, between 1000 BCE and 30 CE, shaping metal was about as whimsical to humanity as a giant robot is to the present-day masses. This ignores the mass usage of metal by the Roman Republic, which was renowned for its pioneering in [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_metallurgy), which had already been invented thousands of years before in [3000 BCE.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_metallurgy)\n\nThe chart then claims that from 30 CE to 1600 CE, Hydraulics and Clocks were invented, ignoring the fact that early hydraulics were invented around [6000 BCE and early clocks in 2000 BCE.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics)\n\nIn short, all of this chart is terrifying in how badly it portrays technological advancement.\n\nMay shame of bad history be upon /u/uetani.",

        "author": "captainbergs",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/24jj05/badhistory_film_review_the_eagle/",
        "text": "&amp;nbsp;\n\n I do love watching awful action films based in antiquity and had been meaning to check out the “The Eagle” from 2011 for some time. In[ this](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/24fxrk/badhistory_review_request_the_eagle/) thread asking about the film I promised to do a /r/badhistory review of it so here we are. Most of my knowledge on this area (Roman Britain) comes from a smattering of modules over the course of my degree and associated reading so any experts feel free to jump in and correct me. If you want to watch \"The Eagle\" its on Netflix (US).\n\n I will do a “timeline” commentary but a few things really struck me (and actually annoyed me) about the film. It’s easy to have small gripes with the accuracy of certain aspects of the portrayal of the Romans and the legions. At times the film is certainly a bit “lazy” bordering on ridiculous (see the crazy testudo scene). The Romans are equipped in your stereotypical “Hollywood Roman Solider” manner so you have some parts that are roughly ok (the helmets) and then really bizarre additions like no solider in the contemporary legion having any form of metal armour. \n\n However it is the depiction of the “non-Roman” people is what really annoyed me. The further North the film went the more ridiculous the portrayal of the Iron Age peoples of Britain became until they were reduced to stereotypical “primitive savages”. \n The Wikipedia article on the film seen here has an article including some quotes from the director and his portrayal of “the seal people”:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; They were a more indigenous folk than the Celts, who were from farther south ... They were probably small and dark, like the Inouit [sic], living off seals and dressed in sealskins. We are going to create a culture about which no one knows much, but which we will make as convincing as possible. We are basing it on clues gained from places like Skara Brae and the Tomb of the Eagles in Orkney, so that we will have them worshipping pagan symbols, like the seal and the eagle. The reason they have seized the emblem of the Roman eagle from the legion is because to them it [was] a sacred symbol.[5]\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have multiple problems with this, firstly it seem to propagate the idea that “The Celts” as an ethnic group (lol) invaded Britain basically totally drove out the “natives” apart from the isolated extremities. I believe that groups from the European mainland did move into the British Isles and there was two way Celtic cultural exchange however the director’s view is ridiculous and simplistic. See this [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1tymcc/i_am_a_member_of_the_british_iceni_tribe_in_ad_61/ced7hvr) for criticism of these sort of ideas about \"celts\". From here the director has decided “Well lol obviously they would live off seals and they would be like the Inuits”. In the quote his basis for this is “Hey there are like these two Neolithic sites with like pictures of animals”. Obviously being a few thousand years out is ok when dealing with primitive timeless savages. \n\n“The seal people” don’t even seem to posses metal working ([Which](http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_101/101_001_110.pdf) had existed in Scotland for at least over a thousand years prior to when this film is set)  and use sharpened sticks and stone axes such as you would see “Indians” using in a western. I have no idea what sort of message this film is supposed to portray about the fabricated seal people. They are set up to criticise the Romans for their Imperialism and brutality but are then ridiculously brutal themselves (they kill a small child for no reason). At any rate the “seal people” portray the non-Roman Iron Age peoples of Britain as animal fur wearing, non-metal using primitives. Which is just ridiculous. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Meat of the Review: The Eagle has landed.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n0.40 – Ok we are in 120 AD with the ninth Roman legion (missing out the Hispania bit). Who (in this film anyway) marched into the unconquered territory of Britain and WERE NEVER SEEN AGAIN. MAYBE. The Ninth legion did “disappear” but there is no actual evidence that they went beyond Hadrian ’s Wall. See: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_IX_Hispana#Disappearance).\n\n1.21 - “all 5000 men VANISHED ALONG WITH THEIR TREASURED STANDARD”. The Eagle (Aquila) of a Legion was a pretty big deal  so the premise isn't that bad. With examples such as Augustus negotiating for the eagles lost at Carrhae and the retrieval of the eagles from Teutoburg showing their importance. This has already been discussed in the other [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/24fxrk/badhistory_review_request_the_eagle/).\n\n1.40 - Due to this disaster (not true) \"HARDRIAN BUILT A WALL that CUT OFF THE NORTH OF BRITAIN FOREVER\" (massive hyperbole) which marked “The end of the known world”. How is it the end of the world if the Roman know about it and have been there?\n\n2.00 – 20 years later... in roman occupied southern Britain.Britain is misty and watery, some things never change. I think this bit could be a bit of homage to the scene at the start of “Heart of Darkness”.\n\n2.36 – Romans in boats. Red capes= check, “Imperial Gallic Helmets=check. Pila = check\nWho is this bloody handsome roman who doesn’t look very Spanish and feels no need to wear his helmet? It’s our protagonist Channing Tatum, who is about as wooden as a scutum. \n\n2.40 - Cows in the river, damn Romans bringing their cattle to Britain and stealing the jobs of being eaten that the British pigs and sheep used to do.\n\n3.00 - We have Caligae, and the legionaries carrying loads of stuff. Checks out. Going to a small fort. I bet the swords are wrong. If you want to read about the intricacies of Roman swords I recommend “Rome and the Sword”. \n\nAll the Romans have American accents, this is perturbing and once again traditional British jobs  are being stolen by foreigners. \n\nNo one in this “legion” is wearing metal armour...\n\n3.40 – The infamous “roman salute” makes an appearance here. To my knowledge we have no actual ancient sources that detail a uniform use of a salute so basically you can just make this up. It also allows edgy people to do a Nazi salute and pretend they were doing it because of the Romans .\n\nChanning Tatum is Marcus Flavius Aquila. As Hollywood depictions of Roman names this is actually pretty good and makes sense. All you need to know is that the eagle is such a big deal this guy has it for his cognomen.\n\nIt turns out “Lutorius Drusillus Salinator” a salty character is the “the acting senior officer”. This is essentially Modern American military lingo shoehorned into the Roman military, which is a common occurrence in The Eagle. I would quibble this because I think it promotes the (false) idea that the Roman army was this super organised military machine that is the progenitor for modern Western militaries.\n\n4.40 - “what made you choose Britain?” *spoilers* it’s because he wants to get the eagle back. *spoilers*.\n\n5.10 – No one in this entire “legion” (of like fifty men instead of five thousand) has metal armour, I don’t know if this is worse or better than “let’s put everyone in Lorica segmentata regardless of the time period or historical reality”. \n\n6.00 - Britain described as “shithole” I guess this film had to make some parts accurate.\n\n6.30 - Mithras worship! This is a decent touch I suppose, worship of Mithras was common in the Roman military. \n\n7.00 - Ok Marcus’s dad (probably called Marcus knowing the Romans) gave him an eagle necklace before he decided to go off and lose the legions. I feel this will be an important plot point. \n\n“Hustle up” not sure if that’s authentic Roman dialogue.\n\nOk the Romans are making cool defenses. Roman military= good engineers is a pretty solid point.\n\n8.20 - “reports of a druid wandering the villages”. Didn’t do a very good job on Anglesey then did you?\n\nAt this point it’s all very “American forces in Afghanistan” The small military garrison are in the middle of hostile country while religious guys go around stirring up the natives. \n\n9.00 - Not even ten minutes in and we get to see Channing Tatum’s finely sculpted body. Instead of being overcome with homoerotic desire I was instead reminded of a brilliant quote from “The culture of the roman plebs” by Nicholas Horsfall, unfortunately I don’t have the book on me but it on pg 104 he provides a vivid description of the body of a hardened Roman solider. With bulging varicose veins, hairy nostrils etc. Marcus and  his Adonis like physique is not quite accurate although with all that marching, drilling and fort building a legionary would be in bloody good shape.\n\n12.00 – The Britons attack the fort, on the scale of “accurate portrayal of Iron Age people to generic barbarians” I would describe them as “halfarsed attempt to be vaguely accurate”. They all wear beige or grey (where is the colour director?) only some have small shields (having a decent sized shield is pretty much necessary kit in stabby stabby fighting) and basically none of them have metal armour. The legionaries just did a really shit job of stopping them getting up on the walls and are now dying. \n\n14.00 – “WELL DONE SIR”. Marcus and his alertness saved everyone.\n\n15.00 - They captured the patrol and made them “pass under the yoke” which is a nice touch. \nIt seems that everyone who isn't speaking English (Latin), from the white cliffs of Dover to John O'Groats speaks “Gaelic” even though it doesn't exist yet. I think we can give the film a pass here as reconstructing the dialect and languages spoken by the various peoples in Britain at this time would be pretty hard.\n\n17.00 - The druid just beheaded the roman captive. Badass.\n\n18.00  - Man this is a really small “legion” and more Mithras\n\n**TESTUDO!?**\n\n**BY JUPITER THEY FORMED A TESTUDO AND JUST CHARGED INTO THE BRITONS!!!!**\n\nI don’t know if that’s awesome or ridiculous. In any case that is not what the testudo was used for and charging a testudo the middle of a mass of enemies is crazy and would result in the Romans dying. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nContinued below....",

Many people say that the USA is one of the youngest countries in the world, I see this comment on many threads, in the media and talking to people (I decided not to link reddit comments to any because I see it so often and it usually just that one sentence). It is often used to refute criticisms of the USA (we are a young country, we make mistakes). \n\nThe fact is that the USA is one of the oldest sovereign states in the world which has existed without revolution or occupation by another country. Almost all of the countries in Africa gained independence in the latter half of the 20th century. Parts of Asia also underwent decolonization or violent civil wars and revolutions. Even in Europe, most countries only gained independence since 1918 or the late 19th century, and those that predate the USA as nations (such as France, Austria, Turkey and Russia) went through major revolutions. \n\nThe USA did have a major civil war, of course. However unlike many other civil wars it was mostly fought in only part part of the country and there was a continuity of the government before, during and after the war. \n\nI also think that the USA when it become independent had the benefit of having English-style institutions well established. The people of early-USA had the benefit of  being familiar with how the common law worked, an established press, universities, trade links, European-style agriculture transposed without problems and an educated, wealthy elite who had ties with their European counterparts. It got access to the heritage of many much older systems.  Post colonial African states or states damaged by traumatic violence (like China) did not often have these advantages, for example. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks\n\n\nAlso these reddit Capchas are hard!",

It's a shitstorm in there. I'm just going to comment on one thing, the idea that the PAVN/Viet Cong forces won the Vietnam Conflict because they were \"savage killers\" and that \"it's hard to beat savage killers humanely\". \n\nThe Viet Cong were so much more than simple \"savage killers\". Vo Nguyen Giap plainly states in his book, \"People's Army, People's War\" that the Viet Cong changed their entire strategy after Ia Drang to specifically fight the Americans. After this point, the Viet Cong realized that the Americans would not call artillery close to their own positions unless they were in severe danger of being overrun. This led to the hit-and-run tactics that not only were effective against an American force used to fighting 'contemporary war', it had a psychological effect as well. The importance here is that you cannot have one without the other. Our friend from the thread seems to believe that it was purely psychological, which is completely incorrect. Also, the guerrilla style of warfare was not the only style fought. Vietnam had several distinct battle which were decidedly not hit and run attacks, some of which were even outright sieges. \n\nNot to mention the motherfucking Ho Chi Minh trail and all the well supplied surprise rocket attacks on American bases. Or the Tet Offensive. No, the Viet Cong didn't force the Americans to leave because they waged a well fought, guerrilla style war against a superior force, they won because they were inhumane. Part of the psychological attack was being inhumane, yes, but I'm getting the vibe that this person believes that the Vietnam war was won off Punji spikes and the boogeyman. I'm not saying that psychological tactics didn't have a hand in the eventual American defeat, but to ignore the fact that they, you know, fought battles and won tactical victories. You can't have one without the other when you're talking about Vietnam. It seems like this dude watched Platoon once and decided that it spoke for the entire war, while failing to realize that the nature of the war changed at least year to year, if not month to month. \n\n",

The post in question is [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/24gr3v/cmv_i_believe_israels_treatment_of_palestinians/ch6zrt6), and it's on a thread that's bound to be full of other historically inaccurate goodies. In this particular case, I restricted myself to just a small bit. Regardless...\n\n...Every other line is factually inaccurate, pretty much.\n\n&gt;First, let's have a brief look at the history. 1948, Israel declares itself independent from Palestine.\n\nNo, it doesn't. It declares itself a state in the area according to the UN Partition plan. It cannot declare itself independent from Palestine, because there is no Palestine. The *area* is referred to as Palestine, but it's currently under the sovereign jurisdiction of Britain (until midnight, which is when both the independence declaration and British mandate for the area take effect and expire, respectively). The sovereignty of the area then falls under international jurisdiction, as Britain chose to transfer the question of how to administer the area to the UN. If at all. At most, it was internationally administered, at least it was empty of any sovereign claim. Israel made a sovereign claim, which the US then recognized de facto as the government in that void.\n\nBorders were not delineated clearly.\n\n&gt;There is a lot of history before this, but it isn't relevant for the purposes of establishing legal status of borders. The first think that happens is that Palestine and neighboring Arab countries invade newly-founded Israel with the purpose of eliminating it.\n\nHow can Palestine invade? Israel is *in* Palestine, as far as the world is concerned. Palestine is not a country. Furthermore, Palestinian-Arabs had already been fighting, because there was a *civil war* going on for nearly 6 months before the actual declaration of independence.\n\n&gt;Israel manages to not only defend themselves, but manages to defeat \"Palestine\" and become one country again as \"Israel.\"\n\nNo, it manages to defeat the Palestinian-Arabs and defeat the Arab armies. It doesn't defeat \"Palestine\", because Egypt, Syria, and co. are not \"Palestine\".\n\n&gt;Please note that at this point, the West Bank was a Jordanian territory, and Gaza was an Egyptian territory.\n\nYes, they were occupied by those forces.\n\n&gt;Palestine at this point has ceased to exist, with a government in exile (The PLO).\n\nThe PLO was established in 1964. How, at this point in 1949 (post-war) are they recognized as a government in exile if they *do not exist*?\n\n&gt;Then, there was a war in 1967, again involving Israel's arab neighbors. Israel won again, and again seized territory from its enemies.\n\nYes! This is right, at least.\n\n&gt;But, unlike the 1948 war, they did not annex those territories; they were simply occupied.\n\nWell, one could argue that East Jerusalem (which was captured) was *de facto* annexed. De jure, it's possible to say they de jure annexed East Jerusalem as well, but again this is a matter of debate. De facto is almost universally accepted as true, but de jure is still debated by some.\n\n&gt;This was also the case with the 1974 war, where territory was taken from Egypt (the Sinai). (Correction: Sinai was taken in the 1967 war, not 1974. In 1974, Egypt recaptured it, but then Israeli took it back).\n\nThe 1974 war? You mean the Yom Kippur war, that began in 1973? I would've taken this for a typo if he hadn't said it *three times*. Does anyone even know how far Egypt got into the Sinai during the 1973 war? [Not very far](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1973_sinai_war_maps.jpg). They didn't capture it by any means, or come close to. The Israeli counterattack settled them into a stalemate. They consolidated their lines pretty far from the actual total area of the Sinai.\n\nPeople like this are the bane of my existence.\n\nFor anybody curious about the way Israel was established in 1948, I did a huge-writeup on it in another Reddit thread. PM me if you want to see it. But jeez, when someone gets the year wrong 3 times in a row of a pretty important war in a nation's history, I start to lose my faith in humanity.",

Now, this isn't /r/badpolitics, so I'll ignore most of the guff, but what caught my eye were some... odd facts about the crusades and medieval europe.\n\n&gt;The Crusaders went into Arabia\n\n\nMinor nitpicking here, but really we're talking about Palestine, maybe Egypt for these crusades.\n\n&gt;After 80 years the muslim nations around them assembled an army and forced them to go back to Europe in peace, and they did, taking half the city's goods with them.\n\n\nThis is where the real fun begins. Firstly, the war between the kingdom of Jerusalem and the Ayyubid Empire could hardly be described as peaceful. Admittedly, the actual residents of Jerusalem allowed to leave wihout a fight; but only after paying a ransom, which in the end, they couldn't afford to pay. In any case, this ignores the entire 3rd crusade, which, despite not fully restoring the old kingdom, managed to retake some of its former territory. The kingdom itself actually survived another 70 years, even briefly retaking Jerusalem itself during the fifth crusade.\n\n&gt;At this point in Europe there was no knowledge even of glass. \n\n\nThis is clearly [false](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_glass#Anglo-Saxon_world), knowledge of glass production, was well known throughout Europe, having largely survived from classical civilisation. \n\n&gt;They had no concept of cushions, nor soft beds--European kings were still sleeping on hay.\n\n\nAgain, another [baseless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed#Medieval_Europe) claim, kings did indeed have beds and cushions before the crusades. Regrettably, I am not an expert on beds, but wikipedia informs me that he style of carolingian France was to have metal bed, upon which cushions were placed so it was as if one lay on a slope.\n\n&gt;At the time Europe was full of brutes, more like the Vikings than anything, who believed in war and violence above all.\n\n\nWhilst the Europe of the 11th century had more than its fair share of violence, recognition of this was widespread, with movements like the [Peace and Truth of God] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_God#Peace_of_God) seeking to reduce the violence of feudal society. Perhaps the biggest problem with his statement is that it implies that Europe post crusades behaved less violently than before.\n\nAlso unfair on the Vikings, who were great explorers and traders aswelll as raiders.\n\n&gt;But these Crusaders' sons who returned to Europe were extremely different. They brought back with them a trait learned from the Arabs that would change everything: the concept of the gentleman,the idea that a person could be both compassionate and strong. This was entirely foreign in Europe, which valued cruelty and violence above compassion and honor.\n\n\nWhilst the crusades did influence the ideal of Chivalry, it had already begun to develop during the Carolingian era. The development of idea post crusades was less in imitation of islamic society than opposition to it; I.e fighting for god rather than one's interest. It could be a reference to the concept of [Furusiyya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furusiyya), but that seems to have developed alongside chivalry.\n\n&gt;This idea swept Europe in the coming centuries, becoming the highest ideal of the Western knight, the sign of nobility, and it is something that is well known about Western people even to this day. It passed into Europe, and from Europe into the Americas. Even as the Muslim world lost that very trait for other reasons (the Saracens died out), the West absorbed it utterly. We would not be who we are today, not even remotely close, without this one trait.\n\n\nI have to admit, I have no idea what this means. The Saracens died out?  Saracen simply meant Muslim, rather like how Frank meant a western European, although I'd like to see the explanation of how he Islamic world lost it sense of gentlemanliness.\n\n&gt;This is why it's vitally important that we establish our own [regionASAP](http://www.reddit.com/r/seasteading) and build a resulting ancap culture.\n\n\nAnd of course, the moral of the story is... is escape statism on boats?\n\nSo, whats the actual reason for this badhistory? Well essentially its a very forced analogy for how people don't think outside of the cultural paradigm they're born into, and pre-crusades europe is an example of this. But really, its just standard dark ages bad history.",

        "text": "I replied in the thread that I'm referencing, but I'd like to make a more comprehensive response here.\n\nA good deal of badhistory and badreligion is going on here. A [meme](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAtheists/comments/24dq72/and_jesus_makes_his_saving_throw/) was posted stating that the Dead Sea Scrolls were hidden away because they were Satanic Dungeons and Dragons rules. I'm pretty sure that's a lame attempt at a joke, but to clarify, they were not rules for Dungeons and Dragons, and they were not hidden away because people thought they were Satanic.\n\nMoving on, [the author posted the meme as a retort to their sister who said that the Scrolls were holy scripture.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAtheists/comments/24dq72/and_jesus_makes_his_saving_throw/ch67ohy) Preposterous! No unenlightened sibling can truly know the content of the Dead Sea Scrolls! It takes a real enlightened mind to know the secrets of Qumran, and they sure as hell weren't no scripture! [Wait, no. They are scripture.](http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/featured-scrolls) They're the earliest representations of all of the books of the Tanakh (except Esther, which was written in another place and time) that we have.\n\nOkay, so we're zero for one on our claims here. Let's see what else they've come up with. [Here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAtheists/comments/24dq72/and_jesus_makes_his_saving_throw/ch6kwuy) we see a claim that John the Baptist was an Essene. If there wasn't a popular conception that the Essenes were the sect at Qumran that wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls, this might be another topic for another post. Since there is, we're covering it here. \n\nSo, was John the Baptist an Essene? At first, you might think so, as /u/burmbastic seems to have done. The Essenes were a sect of Judaism that Josephus describes as living across ancient Israel, living communally, being celibate (in most cases), practicing some sort of collectivism, strict diets, purity, and other ascetic practices. John the Baptist is said to have come from the wilderness, and practiced asceticism of some sort, but that does not necessarily imply that he was an Essene. ^[[1]](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05546a.htm)\n\nNow, there is a second question about the Essenes, and that is whether they were the specific sect that wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. The prevailing theory is that yes, Essenes of some sort wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. Eliezer Sukenik was a major proponent of that theory. Main arguments in favor of this theory cite the scroll of the Community Rule, and its similarities with Essene practices related by Josephus. There were mikvot (Jewish ritual baths) at the Qumran site, implying a traditional religious presence. Our old friend Pliny the Elder describes Essenes living in the same general area, on the west shore of the Dead Sea.\n\nHowever, as this is a Jewish topic, there's a good amount of disagreement on the theory. Some theories suggest that the scrolls were not written at Qumran at all, and reflect some other origin, such as Jerusalem, an idea held by Norman Golb. Yizhar Hirschfeld considered the area to be home to a Hasmonean fort, which would explain the presence of the texts as routine religious materials. \n\nPersonally, I'm a fan of two other theories. First, the Qumran community was an ascetic sect who produced the texts, but wasn't necessarily a community of Essenes. An extension of that theory is proposed by Lawrence Schiffman, who is Professor of Jewish Studies at Yeshiva University. Schiffman suggests that a Sadducee group was present at Qumran and produced the texts, citing purity laws identical to writings attributed to the Sadducees by other rabbinic sources. In addition, some calendrical scrolls at Qumran follow Sadducee principles for dating the holidays.\n\nTL;DR The Dead Sea Scrolls are not the Codex of Light and Darkness of the Eldritch Wizard Hebrews, and John the Baptist was just a bit of a loner.",

Some believe that development of the New Testament canon was partly spurred in response to, and in opposition to Marcion's heresy and own heretical cannon. Nobody (besides /u/Science_Killed_God ) is saying that the New Testament canon was developed with the cooperation of Marcion. \n\n**Claim Two: Marcion was not considered a heretic during his life:**\n\nWhen asked where OP got this information, he/she quotes the first paragraph of Wikipedia, conveniently emphasizing the sentences they deem to be relevant:\n\n&gt; Marcion of Sinope (Greek: Μαρκίων[1] Σινώπης), (c. 85 – c. 160) was the son of a bishop in early Christianity. **His theology rejected the deity described in the Jewish Scriptures and in distinction affirmed the Father of Christ to be the true God.** He was denounced by the Church Fathers and he chose to separate himself from the proto-orthodox church. **He is often considered to have held a pivotal role in the development of the New Testament canon.**\n\n[He also has an explanation for that problematic bit about Marcion being denounced by the Church Fathers](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAtheists/comments/24b5w0/meet_marcion_of_sinope/ch5e50h):\n\n&gt; Of course later, after the Roman Emperors dictated what was and wasn't Christian (in order to use it as an instrument of power), Marcion was denounced because they realized he made he rest of them look foolish. But that doesn't change the fact that he helped to decide what books make up the Bible.\n\nI immediately found this explanation suspicious. The Wikipedia article he quotes seems to imply that Marcion  chose to separate himself from the proto-orthodox church in response to the denouncement of the Church Fathers, and yet /u/Science_Killed_God would have us believe that Marcion wasn't denounced until quite some time after his death, when the emperors of Rome took an active role in supporting Christianity. (Also, the emperor never \"dictated\" what was and wasn't Christian, but that whole bit could be its own thread).\n\nOne mustn't look farther than further down *the same* Wikipedia page to see that OPs explanation is badhistory. Not only was Marcion excommunicated by the Church of Rome during his lifetime (they even returned the donations he had made to them), he was by some accounts even excommunicated by his own father, also a bishop (this account is a little more dubious). After some a bit of digging, I even discovered that some believe that [the eleventh mandate of the Shepherd of Hermas is a reference to Marcion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shepherd_of_Hermas#Contents).\n\nThe irony of this all is that, for a community that so prides itself on its skepticism, /r/AdviceAtheists seemed all to eager to swallow information that reinforced their worldview - even when that information could have been dispelled by reading the next few sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

Pro-atheists will characterize it as not even being present, just an idea, and not an actual driving force, motive or characteristic of activity. I think a much more accurate point of view is to say that atheism as political policy has, in the experience of humanity, produced some of its most abominable behavior, and is perhaps most clearly expressed by the Soviet Union. Religious political policy, in the big picture, has a much, much better track record, in my opinion. But have a look at this and tell me if it's \"bad history\" or maybe the way it's used in arguing is simply bad history.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Soviet_Union\n\n&gt;The state was committed to the destruction of religion,[2][3] and destroyed churches, mosques and temples, ridiculed, harassed and executed religious leaders, flooded the schools and media with atheistic teachings, and generally promoted atheism as the truth that society should accept.[4][5] The total number of Christian victims of Soviet state atheist policies, has been estimated to range between 12-20 millions.[6][7][8]",

But that's more /r/badphilosophy, let's get to the history. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; The reason I feel this way is, for example, the ancient Greeks - one if the smartest and most innovative civilIzations of all time. They created philosophy and advanced math science and music. **However, they still had religion.** Because of this they never searched for the true reasons of stuff, ie: earthquakes, lightning, etc. \n\n\n\nYes, I'm positive it *was religion alone* that kept bronze-age civilizations from determining the mysteries of plate tectonics and electricity. This is pure supposition, and assuming the Greeks just saw lightning, shrugged and assumed 'Well, that's Zeus. No point studying that further.' A fairly unfounded belief at best.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Combine that with the Roman Empire and there is potential for there to have never been any dark ages or medieval plagues.\n\n\n\nSome Dark Ages baloney here, plus the hilarious idea that religion somehow kept us from unlocking medical secrets. And while Romans could be very resistant to cutting dead bodies open, assuming that no religion (providing a Roman empire exists in such a context, which is unlikely because Rome -like all ancient civilizations- was extremely deeply tied to religion and removing that would remove the whole civilization or result in an empire that is completely unfathomable to us, a persistent problem with OPs argument: we have zero idea how an atheistic society would develop) is going to magically shoot medical technology forward to germ theory and allow us to defeat The Black Death.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; With those people working on advancing sciences **and not working on staying alive** and killing heretics, we could have gotten even more advanced. Humans could be so much more advanced in the 21st century if it wasn't for religions.\n\n\n\n\nHow would no religion result in less time spent 'staying alive'? \n\n\n\n\n&gt; Furthermore religion has in total done more harm than good. Yes, it has made people do small kind deeds, but it has also been used in the name of war,\n\n\n\nHumanity has used everything for war, and pretty much every single one boils down to power and resources. Statistically, only [around six percent of wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_war#Criteria_for_classification) were actually true 'religious' wars.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; the use of it to endorse slavery, the use of it to endorse the holocaust\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure Darwinian-based concepts were heavily at play in those as well. Eugenics and the like.\n\n\n\n\nThis is basically the epitome of bad history. Making massively broad assumptions that cover heavily varied subjects, totally un-backed arguments, pre-set notions and a massive axe to grind, and making up alternative possibilities of history playing out that have no backing or merit behind them whatsoever.

        "text": "In the course of a rebuttal to his error ridden Tesla comic (a comic that has been picked apart a bunch of times already for it's factual inaccuracies by better men than me), the Oatmeal explains his view of history:\n\n&lt;in response to the claim that both Tesla and Edison were flawed human beings&gt; \"Don't cop out as a writer and adopt the easily defensible \"we're all just humans and no one is remarkable\" attitude. Pick a side. Praise your heroes. Demonize-a-cat-killing-overrated-inventor-douchebag.\"\n\nFirst off the point of the piece he was responding to was not that \"no one was remarkable,\" it was actually \"these two guys are both remarkable, but also kinda flawed.\"\n\nMore importantly though, this is a terrible way to write about (or read) history. Studying history, and talking about history, should be about explaining and understanding what happened back then and why. It is absolutely not about taking sides. \n\nBut this isn't the worst part of the rebuttal:\n\n\"Lastly I'm a comedian and I speak in hyperbole. If you sharpshoot my work you will find I exaggerate for the sake of comedy.\"\n\nHoly shit is this a terrible excuse. If you present a bunch of information as true, and it then turns out some of it was false, you don't get a pass, because it was funny. You were still spreading misinformation, while disguising it as truth.\n\nThis is made much worse by the fact that earlier in the response, The Oatmeal claims to have known that one of his statements (the one about the usefulness of radar underwater) was basically false, but he kept it in because he wanted to make the joke. That means that at least once he intentionally misled readers with a false statement he was claiming as the truth. This is not ok. \n\nBut we aren't quite at the end of this awfulness, see The Oatmeal had a reason for writing the original comic.\n\n\"Comic was a meditation on being a geek and by example explores one of the greatest geeks of all time...\"\n\nThe Oatmeal was spreading misinformation and using hyperbole in order to advance and maintain his own socio-cultural identity. And nothing  bad ever comes from that practice. \n\nI realize this is kinda a weird badhistory post, because I didn't touch on the actual factual inaccuracies, but instead focused on how The Oatmeal talks about history. It just makes me mad when people decide to flippantly re-write and simplify history in order to make some trite point. History is complicated and it deserves to be treated with respect.\n\nLink to the rebuttal:\n\nhttp://theoatmeal.com/blog/tesla_response\n\nLink to the Forbes article:\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/05/18/nikola-tesla-wasnt-god-and-thomas-edison-wasnt-the-devil/\n\nLink to Tesla Comic:\n\nhttp://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla\n\nLink to an interesting askhistorians post that suggests the whole \"feud\" between Edison and Tesla was wildly exaggerated:\n\nhttp://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1np8qu/what_really_happened_between_edison_and_tesla/cckr0ji\n\nEdit: words",

If you're going to \"educate\" people, the least you can do is not come off as a pretentiouss ass.\n\nSo realy, how accurate is it? Do you have any experiences with it?",

If the mods are fine with having such a thing implemented, we can run a contest to pick a user-made banner for the sub.",
