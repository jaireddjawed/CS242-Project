        "text": "So in a game of Mage the Awakening, one of our cabal had made some silly choices and we ended up having the Seers of the Throne on our tale (the wizard bad guys of the setting). This was a real issue and so, unfortunately, we had to abandon our lovely safe house. I decided though, that I was going to leave the Seers a present in the form of a stray cat that I was going to turn into a raging death beast.\n\nSo, when you cast a spell, you roll a number of d10s and the number of success are how well you did. You can also cast a ritual to make bigger spells. You keep funnelling magic in until you have to sleep, eat or pass out. Thing is though, I was a life mage and we had a mind mage in the party to buff me as well, so I basically didn’t need to eat or sleep and I didn’t get tired.\n\nLet the ritual commence. \n\n36 hours and 40-50 successes and we got the hell out of there. The thing I left in there had magic resistance, regeneration, venom to spit, a scorpion tail, chameleon skin as tough as rhino hide etc. The list goes on and on. It was quite a terrifying monster.\n\n3 days later there was a “gas explosion” at the property, wiping it off the map. The evil super mages had decided that it was easier to just blow the place up than to go in and kill the stray cat that I had dubbed “Nemesis”. Apparently, its kill count was up to 11 before they gave up.\n\nIf you want to hear my thoughts on bad decisions (there are more stories there too)\nhttp://jrkaneauthor.com/2018/01/15/the-beauty-of-bad-decisions/",

        "text": "The party consisted of: A critfisher Samurai, an archer Bard, a dagger Rogue, a fire/illusion Sorcerer, my unarmed Paladin, and his brother the Picaroon/Gunslinger/Rogue. Most importantly however, we were using the critical success/failure card deck.\n\nEarly into the campaign, we found a sword which allowed someone to cast Shield Other, which led me to decide to build the Paladin as a blood bag: I'd boost my healing capacity and take damage from the party's melee combatants.  For the next 9 levels, I would take half the Samurai's damage, and I added a second player's damage when I received 2nd level spells. With my lay on hands focus, I could generally keep up with taking damage for two other party members. It was a risky game, but boosting players saves, AC, and effective HP while concentrating our healing requirements in one place seemed effective.\n\nThen, the Gunslinger hit a snag. \n\nWhile using a double hackbutt to Vital Strike, they rolled a one, and confirmed the miss. The critical fail card? Roll to hit yourself, the attack is a critical threat if it hits. He connects. He confirms.\n\nGuess who my Paladin had a Shield Other on? \n\nMy Paladin of the god of Healing has the the split-second to let his brother absoluteky kill himself by dropping the spell, or trying to save him by keeping it. The party was already several round into a fight, so both of us were already hurt. Hurt enough that the 144 damage his critical vital strike delivered kills *both* of us. Straight to true death, not even stabillization checks.\n\nNow, I'm waiting to see what happens when the party explains to our mother why both her son's heads exploded.",

        "text": "This is one fifth vent and four fifths story:\n\nTL,DR: I ran an encounter that was super fun and went according to plan but now I can't run it with that group ever again.\n\nContext isn't super important here, except that this game takes place on a post apocalyptic earth in the future, and is nearly devoid of non-aggressive life.\n\nMy expedition crew was following a long road to investigate a factory, and came across a small town. After much discussion of either going through the town or going through the tall grass, they decided the town was safer. Going through, it was eerily quiet, until they passed by a huge museum-from which they heard voices.\n\nThe soldier of the group suggested ignoring it, but he was outvoted. Getting closer, the conversation turned out to be about soup, of all things, and what the best sort was. Upon entering the lobby, the voices cut out and a new set started up on the balcony, this time about building a new home.\n\nThis set also stopped as soon as someone checked it out, only to be replaced by a conversation about buying things from the gift shop, deeper in the museum. All while the soldier continued to stress how dangerous this was, everyone walked in, trying to follow the voices that went around the corner right before they entered the third room. \n\nTaking his rifle, the soldier crept forward, first in line, with everyone else shortly behind. Because he was a bit ahead and everyone else rolled so well, he was the only one to fail a perception check for a light \"thump\" behind them.\n\nIt was a glorious moment for a gm as the players described slowly turning around, only to see a messed up and stitched up amalgamation of at least 7 people, standing 15 feet tall and moving very silently. What evolved was a standard combat encounter with a few very close calls (one had their psychic ability reflected back at them due to my critical, another was picked up and nearly torn in two), but they all ended up leaving mostly okay.\n\nThe point of this long story was that I was sooooo pleased with how the players decided to investigate this hook, and how much fun it was with them having no idea what was going on (of course with homebrew monsters it always is a mystery, but I thought this was one of my better ones). Of course I can't use this type of monster on them again or it'll shift from subtle horror to shoot em' up, which I slightly regret. Oh well, now I'll just need to find some new way to creep them out!\n\nSorry for the long wall of text, I just really wanted to get some of my feelings about this encounter out there! If you made it this far, do you have any homebrewed (or RAW) monsters or situations you were sad you could only use once?",

        "text": "In the group I'm playing with every other saturday, we did a worldbuild beforehand, and among a lot of other specifics, decided that all deities in our setting are neutral entities that embody various 'aspects'.  Anything that can be summed up in one word can generally be a diety, such as rage, envy, shadows, time, hope, honor, nature, etc. can all be a divine power source.  These neutral deities only care about their aspect being spread, for good, evil, or otherwise. Furthermore, we homebrewed that divine intervention was a thing, in the course of events that someone embodies a particular aspect/deity.\n\nFast-forward to 2 game sessions ago. We're tasked with escorting a caravan of huge wagon-machines to deliver something like 1000 tons of airship parts. We keep getting attacked by orcs. We fend them off each time they attack the caravan, but they're persistent, and seem to be coming with regular frequency.  \n\nWe send the scout out who finds a fortified orc encampment containing a few dozen orcs (we'd killed around half their numbers over multiple attacks by this point). He reports back, and we decide to deal with them before continuing, as we'd only made it halfway to the location to pick up the parts, and would have to make our way back through the same territory on the return trip.\n\nAs our party approached the orc encampment, we spotted a pair of slacking guardsmen loafing near the treeline next to the encampment's entrace. Our psionic convinced one of the orcs that his deity (power) was speaking to him, and told him that his tribe's leader was becoming weak, and to take the tribe for himself through force.\n\nHe *immediately* planted his axe into the face of his fellow guard, then marched up to the orc encampment.  None of us spoke orcish (luckily, the psionic's power bypasses language barriers), so we could only watch on in mixed fascination/horror as the orc grunt proceeded to convince the gate guards to support him as the new chieftan, and marched into the center of the encampment and challenged the current chief's position.\n\nWe began dropping buffs on \"our\" orc, and started using thaumaturgy to make the flames in the camp change color and burn brighter, made the ground shake, and other 'signs'.  As the belief of the tribe reached a crescendo, our psionic cast an illusion of the symbol of power over the head of our orc. Even their shaman was convinced at this point, and turned on the chieftan, which caused the fight to begin.\n\nSuddenly, our orc started to glow red, and began to give off a hazy aura, yet none of us were the cause. Our cleric lost control of the shield of faith spell he'd cast on the orc, and it's muscles began to swell.  The orc tribe began slaughtering one another, until finally, the old chieftan was slain by the new.  Upon seeing power change hands, the surviving orcs laid down their weapons and cheered their new chieftan. Once the battle ended, the red haze around the orc disappeared, but not the swollen muscular form. He'd been permanently altered by the divine intervention.\n\nMeanwhile, I used acid to burn a hole in the log-wall nearest the chieftan's tent, and we slipped inside and stole multiple chests full of loot.  The psionic waited in the tent for the chieftan to return, after shrouding his appearance in furs and skins he'd found in the tent.\n\nUsing the same ability, he pretended to be the deity of Power again, and commanded the orc to return to their homeland and rebuild their bloodied tribe, but first, to kill the shaman who was too foolish to see the weakness in his own chieftan. With a fist to chest in salute, the new chieftan 180'd out of the tent, marched up to the shaman, and beheaded him in one stroke, while we snuck out the 'backdoor' with the loot and made for the treeline.\n\nWe successfully delivered the parts, but not before some of my companions broke&amp;entered, broke more stuff, stole some stuff, and caused a hazard to the public. But that's a story for another time.",

        "text": "Several months ago I posted about the dilema that a Paladin of Iomedae had when he found out that one of the party worshiped a very much evil deity by the name of Zon-Kuthon.\n\nSome paladins I know of might have gone down the route of Smite Full attack and end the threat. He would in some ways been within his rights (Non PC on PC violence nonwithstnading of course). \n\nCole however was a little more naive and less cynical than this. He wanted to do good in the world, and follow in his Grandfather's footsteps (GrP had been a crusader himself). (Immediate Good versus Greater Good, Personal Code versus Law of the Land discussions and musings were very much had at this point, and I began keeping a journal about it all)\n\nSo in any case, Cole goes to war from the Mwangi Expanse with his rather unusual mount (Stegasaurus that he raised from an egg) called Thumper because of the noise that she made when she trod anywhere.\n\nDuring the opening scenes they are seperated, Cole with the Party, and Thumper lost apparently to the void. They fight their way up from the pits of the mongrelmen and so on, make some friends, get seriously bloodied and battered. Cole finds out that war very much isn't like the stories of his grandfather's stoop and grows up pretty damn quickly to becoming a little more jaded, a little more reserved, and yet still desperate to see the good in people and to make an impact. \n\nThe party eventually make it to the surface, and there is a battle in the Library where cultists who had come across Thumper slaughtered her, but not before she had laid what would be her final (and first) clutch of eggs. Cole was there, within 50 feet, but could not save her. He grew bitter somewhat then. Began to doubt what was right from wrong, and how to tell the difference.\n\nWe assaulted the last keep, Cole came across Radiance, got to wield the sword for the final climatic encounter. In a meatgrinder of a mission, the big bad began manipulating the macguffin and the first thing that came to mind as a Player and within character was to do something crazy. \n\nUnderstand this. Cole has been enlarged, and is a massive lump of irritated Paladin in fullplate armour swinging a greatsword sized Radiance around the room, but is also bloodied and almost dead at this point. \n\nI bullrushed the big bad, attempting to break her hold on the Macguffin. Our GM allows us to negotiate somewhat the effects of various effects, so a discussion came about where I offered to negate all damage of a regular bullrush, accept the damage that was coming his way from the AoO, for the singular purpose of breaking the contact between the artifact and the demon. \n\nIt worked, but Cole was killed in the process. His final acts to try and do whatever it took to save the world, fully understanding that sometimes life comes down to a singular moment, and that is what defines you. \n\nHis sacrifice likely prevented a TPK, and allowed the party the brief moment needed to swing the encounter to their favour. \n\nWe saved the city, and for now saved the final crusade.\n\nIt's a victory, but damn if it doesn't feel bitter sweet. I am making a Zen Archer Monk for the next character, but there is a part of me now that wants to continue that journal as though Cole had been there all along to work out where it would have all taken him. I suspect that given how he was going it would likely be towards a Fall, but then working through the redemption would have been amazing too. \n\nSo I guess what I am saying is, Paladins can be insanely fun, but need to be played right. \n\n\n*For I am the light against the dark, and the first and last defence of man. \nWith my strength I protect them. \nWith my resolve I lead them. \nMy life for theirs.*",

I was a little awkward at first with the character as I didn't plan enough to know where I wanted to go with him, but I recently wrote this up for a short backstory and I feel like he'll be a lot more fun. If you have any constructive criticism, feel free to drop a comment, and here we go!\n\nVor’rifor, the Twi’Lek Slaver\n\nAerd was sold into slavery by his parents at the age of 6. Due to this, he is incapable of the non-verbal communication that Bothans engage in with other members of their race. Vor’rifor was a cruel taskmaster, sending the young Bothan to complete grueling jobs, running days at a time with only the smallest portions of food and only enough water and rest so that Aerd could amble where he needed to go. \n\n\nThe only light in Aerd’s life was the hidden kindness of Vor’rifor’s wife, Ochodrune. Whether out of the kindness in her heart, or some form of pity, she would sneak Aerd treats, trinkets, and most importantly to Aerd- books. Not the heavy tomes that Vor’rifor forced him to slog through, but tales of Jedi and Sith. Tales of the Force. Tales of love, of light, of good triumphing over evil. Even with the soft reprieve granted by Ochodrune, however, the life of a slave became too much for Aerd to handle. He slit his master’s throat in the dark of night and took some of Vor’rifor’s credits, but only enough to purchase weapons and light armor to defend himself, and some for food, leaving the rest of the credits alone for Ochodrune to use. Thus began Aerd’s life as a free Bothan. But it was not to last...\n\n\nCrooked Contact: Zish Gudmosss the Trandoshan\n\n\nZish contacted Aerd many years ago with a business proposal. He sent the young Aerd to borrow a starship and 300,000 credits worth of goods from the Pirate Queen, to be sold at an increased price to underdeveloped planets in the Outer Rim. Aerd performed the task, but was led into a trap, where he was beaten to an inch of his life by Zish and his guard. The devious lizard stole the starship and goods and went into uncharted space. \n\n\nUnable to find Zish, the Pirate Queen turned to Aerd and put the task on him to replace what she had lost, leaving him heavily in debt. He spent 10 years in her servitude, but refused to be called a slave. Now, with his debt paid, he seeks to get even with Zish himself… by any means necessary.",

        "text": "Many years ago, back in Vanilla World of Warcraft (prior to 2007, when *The Burning Crusade* expansion was released), I was playing as a mighty warrior. I had started the character with visions of smiting my enemies (Smite, however, being a Priest spell) with the legendary Ashbringer, once someone figured out how to get the damned thing - it had been discovered by mining the game files, but at the time, there was no information about how or where to actually acquire it.¹\n\nNo, my hopes of crushing my foes as an Arms Warrior were instead crushed themselves when my guild mates - mostly people I considered friends in the real world - called out to me in a crisis: they desired to run dungeons, but while they had plenty of healers and damage dealing characters, they had none that could - or, at least, would - step in to the role of tank.  \nAnd I was a warrior; at the time, largely considered to be the *ONLY* tank class.  \nSo I stepped up: I threw on a sword and shield, and paid my gold to change to Protection. And I never looked back.\n\n---\n\nOn this particular occasion, a group of real life friends had gathered online to assault the dungeon known as Stratholme; once, it had been a town infested with plague, where a terrible decision had been made: raze the town, and kill the diseased townspeople before they could turn; a decision which would eventually exact the ultimate cost - Prince Arthas' very soul. As a result, this thrice-cursed place was infested with hostile undead, but the powerful enemies within also had a habit of dropping pieces of the class armor sets, making it a desirable place for a group of hardy adventurers to battle through. My warrior was leading the party as the tank; my best friend and co-worker Dave² was bringing his rogue; another friend and co-worker Pete² was bringing his mage; and Mary,² the woman who would one day in the distant future become my wife, was bringing her priest to heal us all. Her priest, having only just reached the minimum required level for the dungeon, was quite poorly equipped; as such, we expected the dungeon to present a considerable challenge. However, we had agreed to take it slowly and carefully, and all were agreed that success should still be within our capability as a group - provided, that is, that we could find another damage dealer, as we were but four, and the recommended group size for this particular challenge was five.\n\nAfter some time requesting assistance through the usual in-game advertising channels, I was messaged by Pete, asking why I was not responding to Jake?² I quickly scrolled backwards through my message window, but saw no such messages. As I was about to let Pete know I had not received any messages, Pete messaged me again: \"Jake wants to bring his warlock, TerriBad.\"² I realized the problem immediately: I'd adventured with the warlock TerriBad before, and the experience had been so unpleasant that I had used the in-game tool to permanently ignore the character. It was only now that I realized that I knew the player behind TerriBad in the real world, too.  \nI advised Pete of the issue: Jake was bad. Not just bad, capital-t Terrible; so bad that he often ruined the experience for everyone around him. However, Jake was Pete's roommate, so he asked on his behalf.\n\nIn the end, I relented.  \nI would come to regret this decision.\n\nOnce we had all assembled at the dark and foreboding entrance to Stratholme, we passed through the portal as a team. Once inside, the gates closed behind us - there was no way out but through.³ Walking through the first archway, we were confronted by several groups of zombies, and skeletal mages and archers; as the tank and party leader, I laid out the plan: the party would hang back, while I drew the first group around the corner to us, so as to battle them where there would be no danger of alerting additional monsters to their aid.  \nI fired a single shot from my rifle into their midst, then ducked back behind the corner, waiting for the monsters to run to me.  \nAnd I waited.  \nAnd waited.\n\nAfter a few seconds of NOT being attacked by monsters, I realized something had gone terribly wrong. I popped out of the cover I had sought, to discover that Jake had summoned a Voidwalker demon - one which acts a tank; as such, it employs spells to draw monsters to itself in order to keep them from it's master. A most valuable tool during solo play, but in group play, where a player is already filling that task? At best, it's an annoyance, and at worst... Well, read on.  \nThe Voidwalker had used it's powers to draw the entire first group of undead to itself, all of which were furiously attacking it. While the demon was a hardy beast, it was ill prepared to weather such an onslaught, and promptly expired. The undead, having eliminated their primary target, now proceeded to run amok throughout the group, even as I tried my best to regather the rampant mob. Unfortunately, one of their first targets had been Mary's healer; and although I was able to distract the zombies from directly chewing her face off, the mages and archers were still peppering her with spells and arrows which quickly finished her off.  \nWe did the best we could, but with our healer down, it was only a matter of time - especially as the very reason that I had tried so hard to draw away the group of monsters was that I knew a patrolling zombie would soon walk on to the scene of the battle; it's path meaning that the point at which it spotted us would undoubtedly draw the unwanted attention of not only itself, but also an entire second group of undead, of much the same size and composition as the first group. Once the patrolling zombie inevitably brought in the second group of foes, we quickly fell.\n\nWipe, TPK, failure - call it what you will; for we had fallen at the very first hurdle.\n\nWe resurrected and reassembled ourselves as best we could. At least we had taken some of the monsters down with us; it should be a simple thing to take down the remaining monsters before moving deeper into the dungeon.  \nMyself, Pete, and Dave were ready and waiting for Jake and Mary. If Mary arrived first, we would wait while she restored her mana. If Jake arrived first, I would immediately attack - the few monsters left did not pose a significant threat, but killing them without the other party members would mean that they did not get to share in any experience gained or loot dropped. Why would I do that to Mary? Because I fully expected that Jake would blindly attack without waiting for Mary, and without proactively controlling the situation, we would all die. Again.  \nJake arrived first.  \nThis time I was able to draw the monsters around the corner, and we quickly finished them off. Mary arrived mid-fight, and promptly spent the meager mana her revival had left her with to close the wounds inflicted on the rest of the party. After a few moments, we were - at last - victorious.  \nThe freshly re-de-animated corpses sparkled with the promise of loot - a few silvers, at most, but something to at least affray the repair cost we'd already incurred. One body, however, was too close to the next group of undead to be safely rifled. \"Don't move forward until Mary has full mana,\" I messaged the others. \"In particular, do NOT go near that last body - it's too close to the next group.\"\n\nMary sat down to imbibe a mana restorative; her mana pool would soon be back to full capacity. While we could take on a handful of the monsters unaided, to attack a full group would be beyond foolish.  \nI looked back to the corpses...\n\n...in time to see Jake run forward to loot the one body I'd specifically told everyone to stay away from. As predicted, the next group of monsters saw him and promptly attacked. As predicted, without a healer - because a healer with no mana is no healer at all - we once again promptly found ourselves at the graveyard.  \nIt was at this time that I saw a new message appear in the party chat: \"WHERE WERE MY HEALS, MARY?\" Jake demanded, seemingly oblivious to the fact that he was the one who had pushed ahead, despite the explicit instructions not to do so, at the very moment when she was completely unable to cast any spells.  \nPete sent me a private message: \"I'm so sorry, man. I never realized - I thought people were exaggerating!\" That was nothing, however, compared to Mary's reaction. She was sitting at the computer next to me when I was abruptly subjected to the fullest and filthiest extent of her impressive vocabulary, as she let loose a sudden barrage of cursing that turned the air blue, peeled wallpaper from the walls, and made a passing sailor blush. Once the violent eruption of cursing had subsided from a raging torrent of obscenities to a mere stream of profanities, she hit Alt+F4 and stormed out of the room.\n\nI very quickly typed out an explanation and apology in a private message to Dave, then messaged the group an excuse: \"Mary's computer just died; I'm logging off to troubleshoot.\" I quit the game, and followed Mary to the lounge where we watched television until she had sufficiently calmed down.\n\n---\n\nJake went back on the ignore list.\n\n---\n---\n\n¹ The simple answer was that it was not some hidden quest or item, waiting to be discovered, but rather that the developers simply had not added it to the game - nor would they until the *Legion* expansion was released in 2016, when it was added as the class weapon for Retribution Paladins. So my warrior, carefully developed and maintained over the better part of a decade, STILL could not obtain the single weapon I created her to quest for.\n\n² Names changed to protect the guilty.\n\n³ Except for warping out via magical hearthstones. Or using a mage's magic portal. Or being summoned by other players. Or opting to resurrect at a graveyard, although this significantly weakened your character for the next ten minutes.",

        "text": "Hello again everyone, I am back with another tale of interesting actions taken by my players while vacationing in Barovia. If you want to read about our previous adventures I will post links to them at the bottom of the post.\n\nThis past week my party decided to take over the town of Krezk, and asked me if they could fast forward a year while they built up the town's economy and defenses. I allowed it but warned them that this would not go unchallenged. So they were visited a few times by Strahd over the year where they were building up the town. Strahd was amused by their attempt to govern his land and said he would allow them to build, but that he would challenge their rule to see if they truly are worthy of wielding this sort of power.\n\n\nAs the players sat down for the session they began showing me drawings of fortifications, traps, and various anti-siege weapons they had designed in preparation for this week. As impressed as I was at their preparation I still had a horde of enemies to throw at them. Soon ta fog began to roll in and they began to find their scouts being left dead at the city gates one by one each with a large number carved in their chest, a new one appearing each day as Strahd's way of letting them know that their time is up.\n\nAfter a few days of last minute preparations the city was surrounded by a mass of zombies, blights, Vistani horsemen, and vampire spawn; about 200 total enemies. Which means the rest of the session was taken up by combat as the players commanded their troops, activated their traps, and threw themselves into battle against their foes. In the end they left one Vistani alive for questioning before moving forward to face Strahd directly.\n\nAs a DM I was very happy at the measures taken by my players to build up their army and fortifications to face this unique threat. Even though there is no hint of this battle being possible in the campaign module I decided to allow it and make things easier for them the more they thought out their actions, because this group has been so erratic in the past. The amount of planning that they put into this session made the battle itself pretty easy in the end, but they all seemed to have a lot of fun attempting to weaken their enemy and proving they aren't just murder hobos.\n\nTLDR: My party took over a town, turned it into a fort, and fought a massive siege against a horde of undead leaving 1 survivor.\n\nPrevious adventures:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7hreph/the_unluck_of_the_draw/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7vyezt/clubbing_in_barovia/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7x6alp/departments_and_dictators_the_curse_of_strahd/",

        "text": "Hello Folks,\n\nRecently I undertook a project to go through and re-edit our podcast versions of our actual plays, and I have just finished the second story-arc in our Vampire: the Masquerade “Twin Cities by Night” chronicle called “Homecoming”.\n\nThis was the second story arc I had ran for this group, and in retrospect there was a ton of pressure that I felt while doing it. In our first arc, three of our four players were new to the game so I was able to do a “who done it” type story to introduce the players to the setting, but with this one I knew that I couldn’t get away with that again. \n\nMy plan before starting this second arc was to slowly introduce more Kindred NPCs, their motivations, and yet allow the players to explore their characters and motivations at the same time. I also knew a “follow the bouncing ball” plot wouldn’t cut it so I tried my best to make somewhat of a complex storyline. Was I able to pull it off? I would say in some ways yes, and in others probably not. I was able thought to learn a ton of lessons as a story teller and to see the players grow exponentially more as role players themselves.\n\nThis story arc consists of 21 chapters, and comes in a little over 12 hours in length. I hope you enjoy, and if you do a rating in your favorite podcast app would mean the world.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/twin-cities-by-night/sets/vampire-the-masquerade-twin-1\n\nCome by and visit our Discord\nhttps://discord.gg/T9zeN9p\n\nCheck us out on iTunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/twin-cities-by-night/id1246523585?mt=2\n\nCheck us out on Stitcher!\nhttps://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=174133&amp;refid=stpr\n\nFind us on Twitter!\nhttps://twitter.com/Twin_Cities_VtM\n\nFind us on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TwinCitiesByNight/\n\nFor more White Wolf RPGs game play and media please check out \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/862703457198327\n\n",

        "text": "At last, I have something to tell here! But first a little about the game. I do not own this game, but went to a board game cafe to play in a group of strangers, and what I gathered is; Dread is a Indie tabletop horror game which doesn't have a concrete setting. We played scifi-horror, but you could write a game into Amazonian rainforest or 1400's China if you wanted. \n\nWe came up with our characters in the cafe with the help of our GM’s helpful questions, but did not know anything beyond profession or a trait, like Mechanic or ”happy go lucky”. Thus I tell only what i remember or heard of the characters during or after the game.\n\nWe also didn’t use any dice to make decisions, but a Jenga tower. Any time a character took a action, they took a jenga block, and placed it on top. If tower didn’t fall, you succeeded, or atleast got through alive. If tower fell, character of last player who touched the tower, was doomed. You could opt to NOT take a block, you could succeed and it would not kill your character…..for now. But it would place a great calamity and misfortune over your whole group. Tower falling down at any time spelled doom to character of the last person that touched te tower, not the current player, so you could screw somone over by trying to make it fall, or sacrifice yourself by pushing it over if it started tipping. \n\nSo, on to the cast\n\nJade: Ex-military woman with 5 year old daughter. At the start of the game, she had a tazer with juice to give 6 shots. She had in the past murdered her husband, and had had connections with the mafia\n\nPeter:  A scientist, who had an empty vaccination syringe. He had a great analytic mind, fascination on prehistoric creatures and yearning to know if there is sentient life beyond the stars\n\nJack: Happy go lucky extrovert, who wished to see if he had what it takes to be a leader. He had a handgun with 3 bullets, apparently way more than average soldier is handed in this apocalyptic earth they left, according to GM.\n\nLuke: Mechanic with Mechanics tools with him. He had his wife and young daughter with him on this interstellar travel for new home. He was recovering alcoholic and had one bad leg from climbing accident. \n\nDimi: My character. An introverted former Quarry foreman, who smuggled a dog in to the ship. Dog that had been ordered to be put down, due to possibly carrying a disease. Dimi had fascination over prehistoric predators, but was forced to become foreman for a quarry, because it was much more useful career than paleontology. Because of this fascination, he accidentally caused collapse, which left his brother, family breadwinner, completely incapable to provide and earned Dimi scorn of his family and a fobia for tunnels. With only his nephew having good view on his uncle, Dimi was allowed to take him with him to the new world. Dog and the boy were everything he had. \n\nYear was 2251, and B2M-Emory Vessel is on it’s 20 year voyage towards new habitable planet to colonise. Our Characters wake up in a puddle of cryo-fluids in their tanks, shivering, lights flashing and error-alarm blaring. Our 5-man team had been woken for emergency, as vessel had crashlanded. Our team of 5 people and a canine traveled out to see what was the matter, and saw that another crew had been woken up in emergency and walked of recently, with their wet footprints visible (Waking up shivering and wet was sign of emergency thawing, otherwise you would wake dry and comfy). We headed to see if our family members on upper floor were ok, using a unstable elevator.\n\nElevators doors got jammed half open on the uppr floor, but after squeezing through we found our families safe….for now. Vessels AI kindly informed us that there was a breach on the outer hull and commandcenter was not functioning right, bleeding energy on a rapid rate, starting from 56%, and through breach to outside poured air. This planets atmosphere was habitable, yet toxic. Our party chose to not fix elevator yet, and climbed the shaft ladders to upper floor, a refreshment center with pools and fountains and all luxuries for the time before colonisation was success. Luke got emergency lights to work, giving us a slow, progressing glimpse of the other crew, torn to shreds, legs and organs strewn all-over and a single survivor, gnashed and terribly wounded. Jade managed to help her calm down and tell us of ”The legs and…and….and gore” At this point, our group started to hear pitter-patter of tiny little feet, and our optimist felt droplets of blood dripping on his head….from a 10-foot long centipede hanging on the ceiling. With that, we did the first stupid decision we could. Split the party. \n\nDimi, Luke and Jack decided to climb down the elevator shaft to fix the elevator, as no-one wanted to climb any higher anymore than was necessary, with giant roaches possibly crawling in the darkness. Peter, Dimis dog and Jade stayed with the injured woman, who, just as Lukes crew got the elevator working, came to her senses of situation started running, screaming into the darkness. Jade started running aswell, shouting her to stop. An this is when the little pitter-patter stopped, and noice similar to dozens of hissing cockroaches started echoing and sound of their feet drumming the ceiling, and rushing towards the noice. Mysterious woman was gored in the darkness. Peters player made the tower fall now, resulting in a centipede coming out of the shadows, coiling itself around Peter and disappearing in the shadows with him. Jade and the dog were not visible in the shine of light from our elevator opening, illuminating a sea of roaches. Together, Lukes crew decided to say ”F..k that noice…”, going up the level for commandcenter. All Dimi could say after that was; ”Where the f..ks my dog…”. Yet not willing to go search for it there, mourning it’s loss. \n\nWhen we stepped out of the elevator, Luke’s crew finally decided to scan for lifeforms  on the ship. \n\n\" **Recreational area: inconclusive. Command floor; 5** \"\n\nEmergency lights showed that command boards had been sabotaged. Wires cut, boards smashed and vessel landed cockpit first in to the ground. Not within even emergency landing protocols (Ship had directional gravity, which made it possible for us to walk on our floors still). With AI confirming that last activity on this floor happened within 0.2 hours, it was clear that saboteurs were on our floor. Luke told the AI to light this floor completely, which gave glimpse to us of a man dressed in black hiding behind something, Jack pointed his handgun, and with stern voice commanded hiding parties to come out. One came first, hands in the air, and other hiding behind his friend, gun pointed towards Jack, firing. Jack dodged, fired back, and as lights were turned off, we hid. Until a hatch opened on the floor, Jade, Peter and the doggy coming up.\n\n This gunman proceeded to point his gun in the back of Jades head, who with fast thinking disarmed this thug and broke his elbow. Lights were turned on, and the thug was tortured to give us the reason why he was here and had sabotaged the vessel. These people were from the mafia, and had plans to make this vessel an organ harvesting plant by turning the ship back home and seemingly meking it disappear into the abyss of space. With this confession, our ragtag team was ready to torture this man for all his worth, until Dimi pointed out that there was still unknown quantities of Roaches one floor below, and this gangster was screeching like a stuck pig, while we played helicopter with his shattered elbow. That info might have saved them, as right at that moment, a centipede started crawling inside our open elevator and towards us. \n\nWe shut the elevator doors, nearly cutting the roach in half, and knocked our mafia friend out. Now that we determined that main power source was irrepairable, we chose to turn on the auxiliary generator, even though it had one great risk. Going to Aux-power means cutting down mainpower, which had around 23% chance to start killing people in their cryosleep. After switching powersources, we chose that now was the best time to go back to our families in cryo, to wake them up and figure out, how to get out of this planet. Jade took Gangsters gun and 20 bullets that were not compatable with Jacks gun, giving Luke his tazer, and we started to make our way towards the hatch Jade and Peter used to get up. Peter chose to climb the last, and as we made our way through now fully lit recreational space, we gathered food and supplies, now that it was peaceful. As we had crossed midpoint of our next ladders, hatch to command floor opened, and Peter stood there, cackling as the roaches crawled over him, skittering for us. \n\nYou see, when the centipede captured Peter, he managed to deduce that \n\n* A) The roaches react to sounds and quick movement, meaning that he could escape if he stayed completely still and quiet, not making any rash moves.\n\n* B) The Roaches were sentient in some level, and had some telepathic hivemind communication. \n\nWith these facts, and his fascination of prehistoric creatures and sentience beyond the stars, Peter had turned coat. While climbing down to the cryo chamber, our party finally realised to ask if the power switch had done anything to cryopods. 65% of the pods were malfunctioning, race was on, to get down and maybe save our families. Dimi chose to trust his dog to Jack, as he was last one on that floor, aiming for Peter. Jack used single bullet to kill Peter, and Luke managed to taze one of the roaches. Turns out, electricity was highly effective against these roaches, and it continued convulsing as long as Luke kept te tazer going. Or until he pierced the Roaches head with a screwdriver. Miraculously all members of the families were saved, as the Jenga tower was already unstable and balancing on several middle blocks criss-crossing each other. Yet, Jack returned without the dog, Dimi having again lost his companion again, just after saving his nephew. \n\nThe party could no longer use the vessel to leave the planet, controls were sabotaged too heavily, the planets atmosphere was toxic so we were afraid of going out, plus both the vessel and the planet was propably crawling with these roaches. Luckily, when Jade had gone missing back after Lukes crew went to fix the elevator, she had found an unused and working escape pod. With this new goal in mind, we used the elevator, killing the bug stuck between its doors, went ap to the command floor, using aux-power to shock roaches nomming on the gored corpse of gangster through loose wires and killing them, walking 3 young children through that and the gore filled corridor of recreational hall without having anyone of them scream in fear, and reuniting again with the dog, which was apparently too simple minded to gain the interest of these roaches, we start to descend into small and cramp tunnel to get to the escape pod. Yeah….\n\nRemember that Dimi had claustrophobia, tunnels in particular? This really triggered it, and I had to go pull a piece from Jenga tower, balancing now on 2 separate places on 3-4 middle blocks. There was no way I could get a piece out of it without tipping the whole tower. And as I tried, I contemplated on Dimi, who has pretty much no-one except his nephew and his dog. He is in the end selfish being as long as he and his dear ones can live happily. So, for the first time in the game, block was not taken. I refused to take a block, and thus managed to get over Dimis fear and through the tunnel. Everyone reached the escape pod, all 6 adults, 3 kids and a dog. \n\n” **Escape pod launching in 60 seconds…..59…58….57….56…..Error: Occupant overload…… 45….** ” \n\nSomeone had to stay behind. Though the dog was proposed at first, it weighted less than any of the kids. Question was asked, Who has the least to lose. Jack had. He had no children or wife with him. No pets. Only his gun, so he got out. \n\n” **….12….11…Overload ended…..6….5….4…** ”\n\nWith breathes held, they launched te escape pod, and it soared in to the sky through the atmosphere….\n\n\n” **Launch successfull….Error….Error…..Error…..No feasible landing paths…..** ”\n\n\nDimi, Luke and Jade, Lukes wife, Lukes daughter, Jades Daughter, Dimis nephew and Dimis dog were left stranded orbiting the planet, with 18 bullets to spare in Jades pistol, and finite amount of oxygen.\n\n\nJack was left on the ground to look at his companions go through the skies, with his hand gun, and one last bullet to spare. \n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7zhkld/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_2/",
        "text": "This is the story of currently three students attending a highschool in Neo Toronto called Bravo Academy, a specially designed facility to help superpowered Novahuman teens control their powers as well as get a good education.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7wf6qa/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy/), students Alistair and Kayla got on the ferry that took them over to the school where they met with other super powered students and some of the staff. After getting a brief summary on what the school had to offer, they were told to head to the changing rooms, suit up in the school’s regulation PE/Heroics costumes and head to the jets for a practical test in the city’s Abandoned Warehouse District. Upon arrival, both players got in a fight with the platoon of Dudebots put there to test them before tangling with legit supervillain Iron Bandit, who they were successful in defeating.\n\nPlayers were awarded one Power Point for their efforts, and at the start of the second session, their Hero Points reset to 1 each.\n\n*Thus, we move onto our next adventure:*\n\nFollowing the fight, Halo takes Alistair and Kayla back to the school and to the medical wing. Hunter, a bow wielding hero and member of staff, swaps places with Halo as he arrives on campus and goes back out to keep an eye on the students, as they had yet to finish.\n\nArriving in the nurse’s office, Alistair is sat down while a medical droid tends to his wounds (Alistair did have some concerns when going into it, but Halo assured him it’d be OK, and Kayla said she’d be able to stop the whole thing should it go wrong.) \n\nHalo commends the two for their sterling efforts, and while he would have preferred they not have gotten into combat and find a safe place to hide, he also acknowledged that stopping them would have been impossible; despite the school explaining multiple times they weren’t purposefully making students into superheroes, the allure of it all can be far too great. When asked if that was meant to happen, Halo explains it wasn’t, and he had no idea how Iron Bandit got onto the training course, but more information would be brought up when they were done interrogating her.\n\nHalo then tells the pair that when they’ve rested and had wounds seen to, he can see them outside to be taken to the Admin offices to pick up their room keys. He also mentions that they’ll be sharing their accommodation with an American kid named Sean Graham, who arrived late and was unable to partake in the exams.\n\nLeaving to head outside, the adrenalin wears off as soon as the door closes, and Kayla flops down onto the bed next to Alistair’s and the too discuss amidst exhaustion what the fuck just happened. While Alistair had been in fights before, the scenario they got caught in was way out of their depths.\n\nAfter the nurse-bot finishes suturing and bandaging the wound, it provides both Kayla and Alistair a couple doses of pain medication, small water bottles and protein bars, telling them in a monotone Microsoft Sam-like voice to come back should they get hurt again.\n\nOnce rested sufficiently, the two leave the nurse’s office and meet with Halo again, who leads them to a smaller building, telling them to wait near the door while he talks to the receptionist, who gives him a pair of keycards. He gives these to the players, and upon inspection they have the number 709 on them, with Halo saying they are in room 9 on the 7th floor.\n\nThey are then taken to the dorms, an almost aerodynamically designed building rather than a standard block which goes up 10 floors, and apparently has 20 rooms per floor. Halo brings Alistair and Kayla to their room, which has double doors as the entrance and the number 709 embossed in gold on the top, which seems standard for all the rooms in the building.\n\nIt’s explained, then later found, that the room the players have is more or less like a hotel suite, with a singular communal area and five adjoining bedrooms, all of which have en suite bathrooms. The communal area has a single kitchen (fitted with fridge, freezer, microwave and oven) and a sitting area with two couches, a coffee table, a wall-mounted TV and a large window facing north-east, showing a scenic view of the coast of Neo Toronto and Lake Ontario.\n\nHalo explains that the cafeteria serves food all day up to 10pm, and the fridge is restocked every week with standard food, though restocking it early or using their own food would require the students to pay for it themselves, possibly requiring a job in the near future. Kayla asks what the consequences for skipping Gym are, and Halo explains that it’s the usual issue with skipping it: bad report card and running the risk of not getting a full high school diploma. He goes on to say that the High School part of bravo academy has your typical Gym class fare, though he does heavily advise to avoid Dodgeball with Golden Conqueror.\n\nHalo leaves, and Alistair and Kayla enter to make some food (Alistair has ranks in Expertise: Home Economics). Inside, they are greeted with a rather pleasant and roomy suite, complete with dozing teenager on one of the couches.\n\n**A NEW CHALLENGER HAS ARRIVED**\n\n*Sean Graham* – The third player in this mix, Sean is a 16 year old American teen from Florida. Ironically, the late-comer is a speedster. He’s got fairly short, brown hair, glasses and fairly sensible clothes.\n\nAlistair goes over to the sleeping Sean while Kayla uses her powers to scan the room with the best Wi-Fi. Unable to wake him with foot pokes, Alistair attempts to make him sneeze by using his powers to make a small dust devil of sorts, but to no avail. Left with no recourse, Alistair goes a bit louder with his powers and creates a loud noise by making a pressure wave between his hands. This is sufficient to wake Sean up.\n\nWhen quizzed, Sean explains he’s from Florida, and that he ran to Bravo Academy earlier that same morning. Sadly, his powers affect his metabolism, leading him to need to eat a fair bit. Thankfully, Alistair was about to make some food, and he goes over to the fridge to discover it’s filled with the most basic, student-like ingredients.\n\nSettling in and conversing, it’s about midevening when there’s a knock at the door. Putting on his anonymiser again, Sean answers the door finding Jose, who hurriedly asks Alistair and Kayla for details on their exam when let inside. Thankfully, no one else in the school seems aware that Alistair and Kayla were the two fabled students to deal with Iron Bandit, and Jose only knows for sure after Alistair tells him it was them, thus saving the two from the Popular complication for a short while.\n\nJose asks to hang out for a while as his two roommates (a punk chick and an uptight, well dressed dude Jose swears is from Transylvania) aren’t the most sociable of roommates to hang with. Alistair bristles at the opportunity to punch Dracula in the face.\n\nJose is asked to demonstrate his powers, and he obliges by summoning his tiger and soon the subject comes up with what the tiger’s name is. Sean, Alistair and Kayla then help brainstorm a new name for Jose as a hero, and Kayla suggests ‘Rio’s Rolling Thunder’.\n\nThe subject is brought up that Bravo is the only proper school in effect, but the International Novahuman Police, the organisation Agent Halo belongs to, is rumoured to have a school in the works. Otherwise, it’s mainly sidekicking and private tutelage.\n\nThe subject of people’s origins comes along. Kayla was the first in her family to gain super powers, but tech seems to run in the family regardless, with her brother having moved to Silicon Valley in the states as part of a larger tech firm.\n\nAlistair inherited his powers from his parents, his father being a former super before his passing some years prior. Alistair got his mother’s wind and pressure powers, and his father’s lightning powers, but he tended to use his mother’s abilities more out of the inherent dangers of electricity. Kayla understands that, having accidentally electrocuted her sister prior to arrival at the school.\n\nSean explains that he and his brother were supers, but in America, it was a different story.\n\nYou see, after the debut of Novahumans during the second World War, adjustments to the Geneva Convention were made. Ultimately speaking, the mere existence of the soviet’s main Novahuman, a demon possessed soldier known as the Red Reaper, raised the question of Novahumans in war being more deadly than the WMDs that were being developed in the Manhattan Project. After all, the Reaper cut a swath of destruction from St. Petersburg all the way through the Eastern Front before meeting his equal in the Third Reich Crusader at the Battle of the Bulge. In this instance, a Novahuman demonstrated more destructive potential without expenditure, being seemingly capable of doing it again at will.\n\nThe USA did not sign this treaty amendment, even after not having their own novahuman during the war, leading to military conscription over the years. While many super avoid the scenario, most who develop powers with a military background have... other plans.\n\nSean and his brother Nathan were military brats, and when Sean’s speed and Nathan’s Hydrokenisis presented themselves, the US Army came knocking. Nathan was taken away for formal training and use, given the code name ‘Depth Charge’, and Sean was enlisted in Bravo Academy by his mother before he ran from Florida to Canada over the course of an hour. (Sean’s speed gives him a current top speed of 2000 miles per hour.)\n\nKayla offers, when she gets better at her abilities to do some covert hacking and help Sean keep an eye on his brother. Then, Sean brings up his chosen codename: Redline. When asked about their code names, Kayla says her current handle is Datastream, but Alistair hadn’t chosen his code name yet. After some more conversation and laughs, everyone retires to bed, and while the beds are certainly comfy, the group feel that small twinge of homesickness, now truly beginning their time at the Academy.\n\nThe next morning the group wake up and prepare themselves a breakfast before heading to homeroom among the throng of other students heading to their morning classes. The group find their homeroom class, and Alistair uses his powers to fuel his own dramatic entrance.\n\nInside there’s about nine other students in the class room, all of whom have mixed reactions to Alistair’s entrance. One of them, a girl with short, purple hair and a long ragged trench coat grins at Alistair’s entrance. The group theorise this to be the punk girl Jose was talking about.\n\nBoth Jose and Pierre, and the girl with the ponytail from yesterday are also in this class. As the group enter, the previously mentioned Transylvanian guy approaches Alistair. He is indeed tall, slim and well dressed, carrying himself with an air of nobility. He introduces himself as Jonathan Estobal, and when directly asked by Alistair if he was a vampire, Jonathan laughed and said no. He complimented Alistair for being so heroic while so young, and while he was 15 himself, he always thought altruism was something one could only truly do when they were adults.\n\nEventually Agent Halo arrives, being the group’s homeroom teacher. He runs the group through the usual information for the school, involving emergency exits, general day structure and passing on other information. Shortly after this, Halo takes the students around the school, showing them different buildings and their reasons for being there, including but not limited to the Danger Room (revisited quite soon afterwards).\n\nWhile wandering around, Sean spies a woman, seemingly a member of the maintenance staff, who appears to not to be enjoying her job. Spying the nametag Ms. Rivers, Sean asks Kayla to try and read the school’s profile on Ms. Rivers, where, after some hacking it is found that she’s been the head of maintenance since the school’s inception, with some notes on disenfranchisement.\n\nAs she accesses the database, Kayla hears a young, almost child-like voice in her head asking why she was accessing confidential information. The two have a very brief talk where Kayla learns the voice is Spirit, the school’s AI that maintains the network.\n\nThe tour soon comes to a close, with Halo rounding off the information needed to be known at the admin building, before dismissing his new students for the day, with classes officially starting tomorrow. With the students still not wanting to ask questions so they could go about their free day, the group are soon dismissed and immediately return to the Danger Room with great enthusiasm and Jose in tow.\n\nThe Danger Room was a large dome-like structure that was part of the sport’s quarter of the school, adjacent to the actual gymnasium, the sports field and the pool. The room is quite large, and has observation areas so those not participating in the events would be able to watch with the usual mixture of excitement and dread that most would experience given the situation.\n\nThe room was the invention of Dr. Nathaniel Smythe, a rather aloof man who constantly wore a steampunk style outfit and often times found the adventure in everything.\n\nSmythe, surprised to receive guests so early, was more than willing to set up the room for the gang, so long as they got into their designated uniforms, and with Sean’s help, he and Alistair were suited up in no time. Sean did drag Jose along to grab his suit from his room, but the ride had truly disorientated him, and he just collapsed when put back down.\n\nHeading in, Dr. Smythe sets up some basic targets and Alistair and Sean go to town, with Alistair obliterating some with his wind attacks and Sean running up walls and zipping around to get the last few. As they have their fun, two more students enter the building, both of whom are from homeroom.\n\nThe first was a stocky kid with short red hair and a permanent scowl on his face. Behind him was a taller, lankier kid with grey hair and a smirk gracing his face. The shorter kid is Gar Malton, while the taller one was Freddy Mars. The two watch Alistair and Sean for a bit before the shorter one asked Smythe if they could fight in the Danger Room.\n\nSmythe was hesitant, asking if this new kid had any particular problems with our heroes, and the response was just a “no, just wanna have a look at something.”\n\nHeading inside, Smythe announces to Alistair and Sean that they have a couple of students who want to take them on, and after a brief amount of time sizing each other up, Smythe activates the safety measures so none of the damage they do to each other isn’t lethal. After a brief countdown, the match is officially underway.\n\nAs the fight begins, Sean’s +44 to initiative allows him to go first regardless of any bonuses or rolls the other might have and he immediately goes for Freddy. Sean aims to land a stomach punch, one that would force Freddy to regurgitate whatever he had just eaten, only for Freddy to slide out of the way. With Freddy going next, moves with similar speed at Sean, who also avoids the attack. Impressed, Sean asks what his handle is, and Freddy explains his stomach generates energy from various materials like a combustion engine, and had picked the name V10 because of it.\n\nKayla, being a non-participant, uses her turn to ask Spirit about both Gar and Freddy, and with some convincing, Spirit accepts and repeats the information about Freddy regarding how his powers work, and explains that Gar is able to project hyper-energised plasma from his skin. Kayla then helpfully informs Sean and Alistair about this.\n\nGar, now bristling with volatile blue energy, raises a hand and it flashes a bright light. Sean is fast enough to cover his eyes, but Alistair isn’t and his vision goes blurry as Gar closes the distance between the two of them. Thinking defensively, Alistair uses a defensive version of his attack to keep Gar busy and wait for his vision to return.\n\nThe battle between Sean and Freddy is mostly a blur as the two brawl throughout the danger room, and Kayla uses her powers to adjust the scenery and make everything look like Bladerunner. Alistair struggles to clear his eyes, but manages to push Gar back, landing a series of hits that did some serious damage. Running out of options, Gar uses Extra Effort to boost his own plasma blasts, and boost the damage more with Power Attack [(An artist's depiction)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng4FOZ244dM) to bring the total damage ranks to 18. (As a frame of reference, it would mean that if it hit, the thing would need to pass a DC 32 toughness save, something that is next to impossible to do at the group’s current power level). Thankfully, it brought his attack bonus down a few notches, and he misses Alistair, causing a colossal explosion behind his target and only causing him some level of fatigue. Alistair rushes in for a melee attack, tanking the damage he would have taken from the plasma covering Gar’s skin and launching the boy skywards, over the holographic buildings and out of sight.\n\nFreddy, now out of recovery actions and unable to move and attack in a single turn, resorts to the only other thing he can do which is to use the Godzilla threshold all speedster’s have, which is the Slam action. Slam means you move at your top speed into your opponent, the damage ranks of which are the ranks of your Speed. Of course, unless you built in that you are immune to such things yourself, the user also needs to make the same check.\n\nSo, in a last ditch effort to secure some kind of win, Freddy runs headlong at Sean at 2000 miles per hour. Unfortunately for Freddy, Sean can also move at that same speed, and steps out of the way. Only just managing to stop himself, Freddy becomes open to a future attack from Sean, who knocks him flat. Freddy, satisfied, surrenders.\n\nHelped to his feet, and while they wait for Gar to make his way back, Freddy is asked why he hangs with him, to which he responds that they just hang out a bit, but he knows Gar is a complete shit head.\n\nSpeaking of, Gar rounds a corner and spies the group. Alistair, now clear of blurry eyed-ness, suggest Gar also surrender, but the response is yet another Ultra Plasma Blast, which also misses. [You Say Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnjwd16vpPs) kicks in, and Alistair closes the distance and lands a violent Air Launcher straight down, forcing Gar to the floor. With our heroes victorious, Gar gets up and leaves in a  huff. Freddy shrugs and goes to leave with him, though on much more pleasant terms with the group. The session ends with the group chatting with Dr. Smythe, who briefly explains the ACME Effect commonly found in mad science: the property by which super geniuses are unable to distribute their tech commercially or teach people how to make it due to any possible explanation being perceived by those with average intelligence as literal gibberish.\n\nThe combat in this session went about as well as it usually does by the standards of MnM, at least for me. Truthfully, however, Gar and Freddy were outnumbered and were of the same power level, so it was to be expected.",

        "text": "**Setting is right between episodes 3&amp;4**\n\nSo I was a Mirialan Soresu Defender that had JUST found a lightsaber from a Jedi just before Order 66. It was obviously hidden away as I had to meditate with a statue of an ancient Jedi to open the compartment. Inside was a journal and a saber. I immediately hid the lightsaber in my clothes, but reported the journal to the rest of the party. We find some stuff about the history of the planet, nothing too much. As we return to our ship, its crawling with Stormtroopers. They detain us and march us back to the temple to meet a Falleen inquisitor. (None of us knew at first of course) She turned out to be the apprentice of the Jedi who stashed his junk there and she returned for the saber. She senses it on one of us and freaks out. Party member was a scholar and happened to have studied Falleen culture, and knew they had duels. So I foolishly challenge her and borrow a party member's sword, only for her to whip out that PHAT red saber. I then draw her master's saber for her to go full Kylo episode 7 on me. She kicks my butt unlike Kylo tho. As I'm on the ground 1 below my threshold with like 3 crits, she kills my buddy (pc who dropped before session 1 but he was important to my pc) and in a fit of rage I just grab my saber and slice her leg off from the knee down. We then cop that lightsaber and skedaddle the fucc off of that planet.\n\nOf course she did come back way later and was holding our pilot's pregnant sister hostage. I kick HER ass this time and am on top of her with my saber and her master's saber crossed over her neck. I'm itching to kill her, but the party is interrogating her. They do it for too long and Stormtroopers come so I just stand up, dragging both sabers across her neck.\n\nLong story short, I dropped from high paragon level to barely above morally gray for that second encounter.",

        "text": "My group usually plays one to two year campaigns with the same characters, so I tend to make mine fairly balanced. For a weekend one-off, I decided to have a little fun with it and roll something ridiculous. \n\nMeet Slug. He's a feral gnome barbarian with an intelligence score so low he can barely speak any human language. He was raised by wolves, then later adopted by a roaming bard whose soothing songs are the only thing that that can quell his frequent rage bursts. Well, somehow he ends up (due to his bard and keeper) along for the ride on a sketchy mission involving court drama and subterfuge.\n\nOn his first carriage ride, he gets nauseous and manages to puke on an elven diplomat, but that's just the beginning. The party are brought to meet the Queen of a small Northern nation. As the rest of the party is negotiating with the queen, Slug, unfamiliar with such plush rugs and such a massive indoor space, decides to relieve himself in the corner. Negotiations are off now. The queen tells the party to consider not beheading all of them to be sufficient payment if they retrieve the artifact in question. Perhaps she would have been less lenient if she wasn't also aware that she was basically sending them on a suicide mission...\n\nAs the party approaches the ruins, it becomes clear why everyone was acting so sketchy before. Something is Definitely Off. But oh well, they can't really afford the queen's wrath at this point, so in they all go. Is everyone pissed at Slug? Absolutely. They've just managed to make it a little ways in, when Slug notices something. He's sniffing the ground furiously and trying to get the group's attention. However, they're all pissed at him, and his inability to speak more than a couple syllables is making it hard.\n\nFinally, someone else picks up on it: the party is being slowly surrounded by a pack of Dire wolves that have been holing up in the ruins. The exit is blocked, and the wolves are circling in. We're all just a bunch of squishy, low level mercenaries for hire, and it's clear that we're in out of our league. Was the DM feeling sadistic or just highly overestimated our capabilities? It's hard to say.\n\nThe wolves close in. Slug, however, understands wolves a whole lot better than he understands people. Sure, he was raised by the regular type, but dire wolves can't be that much different to figure out. He walks up to the Alpha, all three feet of him, and begins to stare him down for dominance.\n\nThe DM approves the attempt to make the dire wolf alpha submit. Slug lets out a piercing howl, I roll the die.\n\nNatural 20, baby. \n\nSlug, the 3ft tall feral gnome who can't even speak common, takes over as leader of the wolf pack. Oh yeah, most of his skill points are in handle animal, so he manages to coax the pack to follow them into the ruins. Every dog loves a good bone, so he doesn't have a lot of trouble getting his brand new pack to dismantle the skeleton guards waiting within. \n\nThe suicide mission became a breeze, well, at least until they had to return to the queen and figure out how to convince the queen to still pay them even after the pee incident. Luckily, it wasn't too hard to get Slug to drink until he passed out, and leave him in the stable for the next royal reception...",

        "text": "(Hello, this is something I've cooked up to pass the time: A solo campaign with myself! Divination Wizards have this ability called Portent, where they roll 2 dice and can replace any rolls in the game as long as they declare it beforehand. Portent Dice Rolls: 9, 19.)\n\nDM: A few days pass, and you spend this time shopping and gathering supplies with Sildar, preparing for the journey ahead. Before you leave, Cor stops you at your room door, holding a bag containing a pearl worth 100GP, 10GP of lead-based ink, 10GP worth of incense, charcoal and herbs. Basically the materials for another set of your ritual spells, along with 10 gold pieces.\n\nPC: \"... But I already have all this! I can't accept this!\"\n\nDM: Cor looks you in the eye and says, \"Be prepared,\"\n\nPC: I gladly accept his gift and hold back tears. Cor has always looked out for me.\n\nDM: He nods, pats you on the back once, then leaves to attend to the inn. You join Sildar by the supply wagon, two horses already saddled up to the wagon and ready to go. If you have anything else you'd like to do in the city before leaving, now would be the time.\n\nPC: I cast \"Alarm\" as an unprepared ritual from my spellbook on the wagon, which lasts for 8 hours, so I'm gonna periodically stop the wagon to update the spell. I unfurl silver thread from a spool and wind it around the wagon, tying up a small silver bell at the back of the wagon. I whisper, \"Allarme,\" and release the magic, causing the thread to vanish and leaving the bell behind. I'll hold on to the bell and if any intruders attempt to board the bell will ring.\n\nDM: Sildar observes this in silence. Anything else?\n\nPC: I inform Sildar of what I’ve done, then say, “Alright, let’s move along! How long to Phandalin?”\n\nDM: As you guys hop on to the wagon and begin your journey, Sildar responds, “Approximately 2 days wagon ride. We’ll head out the southern entrance, then make our way east along the Triboar Trail. We’ll be making camp somewhere down the trail,” The ride is relatively uneventful at the moment, as the wagon thunders down the well-trodden road south. Do you have anything you would like to ask Sildar? Any communication?\n\nPC: Not from me. Sildar?\n\n(d100 roll, 68)\n\nDM: Sildar turns to you, “Savant, I must say that your command of magic is unlike anything I have seen in my years of travel. Are you entirely self-taught?”\n\nPC: “Yeah… Learned everything I know from the books I read, along with quite a bit of experimentation in my own time. I used my knowledge and skills to run a sort of… Advisory and investigation gig from the inn. Identifying objects, finding lost articles or children, stuff like that,”\n\nDM: “Sounds like a lot of fun. So it was mostly smooth with no scuffles?”\n\nPC: “You wanna know if I’ve ever been in a fight? Well, the truth is I’ve avoided combat of any kind. I prefer to duck out, talk my way out, or just don’t get into a difficult situation in the first place. If you need to get into a fight, I think you’ve already lost,”\n\nDM: “That’s… One way of looking at things, I suppose,” you notice Sildar shifts uncomfortably in his seat, now keeping a more vigilant eye out.\n\nPC: “… Tell you what, we get into a fight, you get to witness the might of a wizard. Meanwhile, I’m gonna pop into the wagon for a nap. Do you mind driving?”\n\nDM: “Not at all,” Okay, so you pop into the back of the wagon. You gonna take a long or short rest?\n\nPC: In the confines of the wagon, I cup my hands in front of me and whisper, “Isaiah”. With a whisper of power, a raven now stands perched on my hands. Isaiah is my familiar, now in raven form. I’ll give him a scratch and ask him to go have a look around since it’s been awhile since his last flight outside of the city. I then lie down in the wagon in a sleeping position, close my eyes, and then take a ride with Isaiah, experiencing all that he is.\n\nDM: Cool, roll for perception; add your raven’s stats.\n\n(4+3=7)\n\nDM: Being in unfamiliar territory, the naturally curious and quick mind of the raven drives him to explore the forest about him. At this time, the wagon begins to turn east down the Triboar Trail, behind you is the west road to the Crystal Crop Beaches.\n\nPC: I’ll keep enjoying the experience of flight through Isaiah, and eventually nod off for a short rest. When I wake up, I’ll take the reins and let Sildar have a ride in the back. We'll just keep rotating like this.\n\nDM: Okay, you guys continue till about dusk, then Sildar turns to you, “I’ll go search for an appropriate camp site. We’re making good time! At this rate we should arrive at Phandalin by dusk tomorrow,” The both of you manage to get the wagon off the trail and into a clearing within the forest.\n\nPC: Cool. First I’ll dismantle the Alarm spell around the wagon and cast it as an unprepared ritual from my spellbook around the campsite, and this time I’ll let the bell disappear together with the thread, so that if anything crosses I will awaken. Second, I gather kindling and firewood and cast Prestidigitation to start a small campfire, whispering “Evocare,” into the wood and causing it to light up.\n\nDM: Sildar preps a meal for you, using some meat, herbs, and vegetables he packed to cook up a nice broth. The two of you eat your dinner in silence. Who is taking first watch?\n\nPC: I look at Sildar, “Have you met Isaiah?” and Isaiah lands on my shoulder.\n\nDM: His eyes open a little wider at this, staring at the crow, “No, I don’t believe we’ve been introduced! Has he been with us all this time?”\n\nPC: “Indeed. It's a little complicated, but he's a magical bird under my command. He'll do what I say, when I say... Most of the time. He’ll be taking first watch, then I’ll take second, and you can take the last watch,”\n\nDM: His eyebrows furrow a little at this, “Are you certain? Will we be unprotected during the final hours before dawn then? Moreover, a... bird taking watch?”\n\nPC: “He's intelligent enough to wake me up when necessary, I've trained him for this sort of thing. Plus, you saw me set-up the Alarm spell around this area, so we should be safe enough. If it makes you feel any better, I’ll take the last 2 hours as well, old man,”\n\nDM: Sildar shakes his head, smiling a little at your jab, “The invincibility of youth. Very well then, young Savant, we’ll follow your lead here. You can sleep in for the last 2 hours,” Roll for Isaiah’s perception.\n\n(18+3=21)\n(d20 for event, 19.)\n\nDM: As Isaiah flutters from tree to tree, exploring the forest, he finds interesting twigs and rocks, which he collects by the campfire. Among them is a dirtied goblet with gems encrusted in them. You awaken as he caws directly into your ear, a smirk somehow evident on his face.\n\nPC: I snap my fingers and send him home to his pocket dimension. I check the goblet, can I ascertain its’ value?\n\nDM: Investigation roll.\n\n(9+5=14)\n\nDM: You find the goblet to be silver, with small gems encrusting the sides which you could pry out if you wanted. The goblet itself should sell for 5 gold pieces, but you could pocket the gems for materials if you’d like.\n\nPC: I’ll keep the goblet for now and take watch.\n\nDM: Perception roll.\n\n(19+1=20)\n(d20 for event, 17.)\n\nDM: As you keep vigilant watch you gaze is drawn to the sky, the constellations shining down upon your quiet camp. Roll for Arcana.\n\n(10+5=15)\n\nDM: Among the stars and constellations you can begin to make out the faint glimmers of a message written among them, with stars seemingly brighter than others, while unfamiliar lights twinkle where there were no stars before. Nothing else happens during your shift. Sildar takes watch.\n\n(15+2=17)\n(d20 for event, 6)\n\nDM: You awaken at in the pre-dawn hours, and find Sildar sitting by the campfire, alight once more and with a broth stewing. His eyes are troubled as he gazes into the fire.\n\nPC: I whisper, “Isaiah,” and allow him to fly around the forest to eat if he wants to. I approach Sildar and say, “Rough night?”\n\nDM: He grunts and makes no further comment.\n\nPC: Insight check? Just to gauge his mood.\n\nDM: Roll it.\n\n(3+1=4)\n\nDM: He’s a blank wall. You suspect he did a 4-hour shift.\n\nPC: Forget it then, eat breakfast, then move along?\n\nDM: Sure, I’m assuming you’re gonna dismantle Alarm and wrap it around the wagon?\n\nPC: Yeah, and I’ll get Isaiah to scout ahead if he feels like it. Same arrangement as yesterday where I’ll lie down and all that.\n\nDM: Perception check for the crow.\n\n(19+3=22)\n(stealth DC failed, 16)\n\nDM: Sildar and yourself hop on to the wagon, thundering down the eastern path once more as the sun begins to rise and warm the autumn air. Isaiah scouts ahead and finds two dead horses further down the trail, perhaps about 2 miles ahead. As Isaiah circles closer to the horses, he sees black arrow shafts sticking out from the corpses, as well as a crest that you find familiar – That of Gundren Rockseeker.\n\nAs Isaiah pulls back, knowing that danger is about, he also spots 4 goblins hiding in the forests to the north by the trail. Two of them are on watch, keeping an eye on the trail, while the other two are about 10 feet further north munching on their breakfast.\n\nPC: I withdraw my mind from Isaiah and inform Sildar of what I’ve found.\n\nDM: Sildar looks troubled at this, and says, “Then these goblins might have captured or perhaps even killed Gundren. This is most troubling. We should probably capture and interrogate them, if at all possible,”\n\nPC: “We’re… a little outnumbered here. 4 against 2 aren’t odds that I particularly like. Also, the horses are blocking the path, so we’ll need to find a way to clear the path for the wagon to pass,” Damn it, Sildar is a warrior so he’s likely going to wanna hack and slash this. Can I do a history check to see what I know about goblins and their cultures and beliefs?\n\nDM: Roll it.\n\n(10+3=13)\n\nDM: Goblins tend to be tribal, gathering in groups of about 20 or so and following the strongest in the tribe. Some tribes tend to be helmed by bugbears. They are simple-minded, quite superstitious, and are known to be mischievous more than malicious.\n\nPC: Do I know if there are any gods they worship in particular?\n\nDM: Not with that roll, you don’t.\n\nPC: Okay. “I have a plan: Why don’t we put on a skit? A ruse? You drive the cart to the horses, then make a show of examining them and proclaiming what cruel god could have done this. Then, I get Isaiah to come down and land on the horses. I use a spell to make him glow, and you’ll pretend to talk to the crow! Imagine he is…” Is there a god of hunts or something?\n\nDM: Kurtulmak, wyvern of the air, patron of nature. Well known in the group of ‘deities’ that may be found in the world. \n\nPC: “Imagine he is Kurtulmak and eventually run off as if scared of the crow. Then, when you’ve run off a certain distance, I’ll speak directly to the goblins through Isaiah by throwing my voice. Hopefully they’ll be intimidated enough to run off. What do you think?”\n\nDM: Persuasion check, roll it.\n\n(17+3=20)\n\nDM: Sildar looks troubled, “I don’t like this idea, but it seems to be as good a plan as any. Rushing into combat against 4 goblins is a fool-hardy plan to use instead. Let’s give it a shot then,”\n\n&lt;DM and PC then spend the next 2 hours researching what Prestidigitation can do, along with the finer points of Thaumaturgy and Druidcraft. The final conclusion is that it makes sense for Prestidigitation to enable your voice to be amplified, since it is a “minor magical trick”. While Thaumaturgy might allow you to literally function as a mouthpiece for the Almighty, Prestidigitation is a poor substitute by comparison. However, on its’ own, it gets the job done.&gt;\n\nDM: The wagons approach the horses, and when you are about 30 feet away you stop. What are you doing?\n\nPC: I hide in the wagon and peep out beneath the covering. I tell Isaiah to get ready and then get Sildar to proceed as planned.\n\n(Sildar performance check – 5+0=5)\n\nDM: Heh. Sildar steps off the wagon, and draws his blade, proceeding to the two horses. He takes giant, exaggerated steps, and with each word he gestures widely with his blade, shouting at the top of his lungs: “By the gods! What mishap hath occurred here?! O merciful Sovra, what manner of beast could have felled such magnificent horses!”\n\nPC: … Damn it. I get Isaiah to land on the horses directly in front of Sildar on the horses. I point at him and whisper, “Evocare,”, and Isaiah begins to glow with a pulsing aura.\n\nDM: “Merciful Sovra, what is this?! What manner of creature are you!” Sildar jumps back and points his sword at Isaiah, striking a horribly exaggerated pose. He pauses for much longer than needed before exclaiming, “So it was you, Kurtulmak?! Wyvern of power, god of nature?! Merciful Sovra!” He falls to his face before the crow cowering, “Spare this servant from your wrath! Grant me this life that I may proclaim your will before all the peoples!”\n\nHe jumps to his feet with a broad smile on his face, “O thank you, my lord! I shall do so immediately!” and he dashes off, running back down the road you came, past the wagon.\n\nPC: … Okay. I tell Isaiah to turn to the goblins and look directly at them, shifting the colours of his aura to a red glow. I grab my throat and focus on the magic, and throwing my voice to Isaiah I speak in a slightly amplified voice: “Goblins in wait, hear my voice. I, Kurtulmak, know of what you have done. Lay aside your arms, and clear this path that others may visit this forest to hear my wisdom. Know that if you disobey me, I shall be most displeased, and you will not be spared from my judgement and wrath!”\n\nI dispel the effects and command Isaiah to shake his head a little, as if clearing his head. Then he flies off to the south, hiding among the trees.\n\nDM: Big moment now, deception check. Roll it with disadvantage because of Sildar’s…. stellar performance.\n\nPC: I use “Portent” to force the roll to 19. Plus my modifier: 19+3=22\n\nDM: Having experienced this once before in a vision, you picked the exact correct things to say this time through Prestidigitation. The goblins meekly come out from hiding, and begin moving the horses away from the road, dragging them into the forest over the course of half an hour. They disappear with the horses.\n\nPC: Perception with Isaiah, can I see where they are?\n\nDM: Roll it.\n\n(15+3=18)\n\nDM: As Isaiah flies back towards the north, you see the goblins slowly and painfully dragging the horses a little further into the forests, animatedly debating amongst themselves over some matter. Since you do not speak goblin, their discussion is a mystery to you. They are deep enough into the forest now to allow you to pass.\n\nPC: I send Isaiah to find Sildar, and then ask him to speak the word: “Come,”\n\nDM: Crows can mimic words?\n\n(One creepy Google and YouTube search later: https://youtu.be/AfsnHVaScjg)\n\nDM: Cool. Sildar eventually comes back looking very disturbed. “Are they gone? How come he can talk?”\n\nPC: I smile at Sildar, “Merciful Sovra, your performance was outstanding! Road’s clear, I got the goblins to drag the horses a little deeper into the forests. Tell you what, why don’t we push on to Phandalin, get a little more hired help, and then track them down and figure out what they have?”\n\nDM: Sildar looks at the raven, then back to you. The confusion on his face slowly gives way to a smile, “Ah, what the hell. You seem to have lead this expedition just fine so far. Onwards to Phandalin!”",

        "text": "The major houses of Westeros had just had a violent upheaval resulting in a number of newly crowned lords.\nThey inherited the lands and resources of their predecessors, and a hunger to rule from on high.\nThe gods had appeared and stated that from this moment henceforth; at the end of every 10th year a relic of the gods would materialise in the temple of kings landing, \nand that the first lord to offer 10 relics simultaneously to the gods would ascend. The rest would be executed. Until that time all lords were immortal unless slain in battle. \nThe newly arisen Lord Loki of the house of Tricksters, succeeded the Arryns of the Vale as lord and master. This is his story.\n\n\nThe lords set about the tasks of developing their lands, harvesting the natural resources, and raising their militaries.\nFor the first 50 years nothing happened; the lord of Winterfell harvested wood, and slowly raised an army of axemen. The lord of the twins developed farms, and built siege weapons, and archers.\nThe lords of Dragonstone and the Iron Islands raised their navies and fished the waters of the coast.\nThe lord of the Riverlands farmed and he too raised an army of infantry, while the lord of Casterly rock mined gold and raised a force of light cavalry.\nThe king collected taxes, raised the biggest army of all from his seat in Kings landing.\nFinally Loki raised a devastatingly large, inconceivably powerful, and immeasurably intimidating army of... villagers. (What use have I for arms and armor? knights, and catapults, and legions of archers? \nsaid he, I am lord of the Vale, and the mountains are my walls, let those who seek to conquer the Vale test the fortifications of the bloody gate.)\n\n\nThe relics of the gods were handed out at the discretion of the king. The first 2 were his, \"By divine right!\", the 3rd went to the Freys of the twins for what all suspected were tributes of food, \n(for how could a lord so blessed in rich farmland have so few troops, while the kings armies grew faster than possible?)\nThe fourth went to the Baratheons of Dragonstone (a suspected bribe to keep the large navy of Dragonstone from attacking kingslanding by sea)\nThe fifth... went to the king.\n\n\nThe Banner of Revolt was raised with the Lannisters screaming for the kings head, joined by the lord of the Iron Islands and the Tullys of the Riverlands.\nThe King fought back with the Freys coming down on the rebels from behind, and the navy of Dragonstone fighting for supremacy of the sea with the Iron Islands.\nTheir forces were evenly matched but the king had time on his side, for the relics would keep coming and the gold they brought would buy him his victory.\nThere were 2 more lords however who had yet to take a side; the Starks of Winterfell, and the lord of the Vale, Loki, with his army of villagers.\nLord Stark of Winterfell had not declared for a side for quite an obvious reason, unmentioned until now. \nLord Frey of the Twins, suspicious of Lord Stark had built a great wall 5 fathoms deep and isolating the Stark armies in the North.\nLord Loki of the Vale was trapped in the Vale with nought but villagers and no military to speak of.\n\n\nAt this pivotal point in history, Stark, Lord of Winterfell sent a private communique to Lord Loki asking for help in getting past the wall.\nHaving slept through the message of the gods Lord Loki asked why he should trouble himself with squabbles over the throne. \n(Whilst the gold of the relics was tempting it was not more than what the army of villagers brought in every day.)\nLord Stark enlightened Lord Loki to the consequences of the 10 relics, and the potential danger he faced from the king.\nJust as this was happening a number of Lord Loki's trade cogs were sunk off the coast of kings landing by the Warships of Dragonstone who had assumed Loki had already declared against the king.\nThus their fate was decided. \n\n\nWhilst a true army in the sense of the word was not present in Lord Loki's domain, he had a great amount of resources and infrastructure.\nThe order was given, and as fast as the eye could blink fleets upon fleets upon fleets were launched from the docks of the Vale,\nFrom the Saltpans to Wickenden, to Gulltown, to Runestone the 12 docks of the Vale spewed forth Galleon armadas, and fast fireship fleets.\nThey sailed south 70 ships strong to swing the struggle of the seas in to the side of the seditionists. A small squad of transport ships travelled north and transported the armies of the north AROUND\nthe great wall. Moat Cailin was simply bypassed and the Twins was in danger. Lord Stark declared for the rebellion and Lord Loki followed likewise. With the Twins farmlands overrun with \nStark Infantry and Dragonstone facing naval battles of 2:1 the Kings defense rapidly crumbled.\n\n\nThe King and Lord Frey were killed, Lord Lannister was crowned King Lannister, the Twins belonged to Lord Stark, the great wall destroyed, the Vale expanded to Harrenhal and a lifelong friendship was struck.\nA new relic had appeared during the war and so the relics were distributed evenly, 1 to all 5 of the rebels and Baratheon of dragonstone kept his.\nThe peace reigned for a short while as the combatants licked their wounds and rebuilt, the trade cogs of the Vale now travelling between home and the docks of Lord Stark.\nIt wasn't long before Lord Baratheon, jealous of the fishing and trade fleets of the Vale, and contesting the gold mines of Claw Isle, made moves to interrupt the economy of Lord Loki with his warships, and punish\nhim for his actions in the rebellion. The time of a pacifist Vale was long since past however and the Fleet of Dragonstone suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Lord Loki's fast fireship fleet waiting off the coast.\nThe Galleon armada unleashed fire on the towers and fortifications of Dragonstone, while the Docks were burned to ash by the Fireships. Many a ship was lost to the fortifications of the island but at long last victory was in sight.\nThe Castle was falling, Lord Baratheon surrounded when suddenly the Iron Islands fleet arrived and victory was claimed! \nAlas, treachery was in the air that day... by decree of the new King Lannister Dragonstones territory and Relic were to belong to Lord Greyjoy of the Iron islands for his victory over Lord Baratheon.\nAn inwardly seething Lord Loki acceded to the kings proclamation and the Iron Islands fleet now had territory on both sides of the Mainland.\nSensing weakness in Lord Loki, Lord Tully of the Riverlands demanded that Harrenhal and it's lands be ceded to him for his greater contribution to the rebellion.\nHarrenhal, with it's extensive blue fortifications overlooking the docks of the Vale and the entrance to the bloody gate, would surely not be taken from the Lord of the Vale who supported the\nRebellion with his fleet of ships at such a crucial moment right? King Lannister agreed with this treacherous demand and declared that Harrenhal must be ceded or war would commence.\n\n\nA private message was sent again... Lord Stark whispered in the ear of Lord Loki, \"Don't do it, we'll fight them!\"\nLord Loki ceded the castle and surrounding land to Lord Tully whos Arbalests moved into the red castle right away.\nThe navy of the Vale retreated sulkingly to Quiet Isle under the watchful and threatening gaze of Harrenhal's castle and Arbalests.\nA recently raised company of Paladins stationed themselves at the Bloody gate, while the 6 stables they had trained at all lay on Harrenhals lands still under the command of Lord Loki.\n\n\nWith their plans set, the castle at Harrenhal opened fire on the docks and fleets of the Vale, King Lannister declared Lord Stark and Lord Loki enemies to the crown and along with Lord Tully of the Riverlands and Lord Greyjoy of the Iron Islands moved to attack the Vale.\nQuick to respond, the fleets received permission to fire back and Lord Loki declared \"The King in the North!\" as the armies of Lord Stark swarmed into the riverlands engaging the forces of Lord Tully. The Vale fleet fought valiantly fighting the ironborn ships blockading them into the river\nand struggling against the ship rending fire pouring out of Harrenhal castle. Having been prepared for more treachery a squadron of siege rams unloaded from transport ships a stones throw from Harrenhal castle where they had been secreted since Harrenhal's change of ownership.\nThe siege rams quickly rolled towards the blue walls of the fort fully intent on smashing down the castle and exposing the defenders inside.\nBearing down on the castle the walls standing between the castle and it's destruction imploded, crumbling into rubble at the command of Lord Loki who had ceded the Castle to Lord Tully as commanded, but not the walls defending it which the Lannister and Tully had overlooked.\nIn seconds the Castle was gone and the archer armies of lord Tully found themselves being cut to pieces by the thundering hordes of the Paladin company that had poured out of the aptly named Bloody gate.\n\n\nWith 1 man in 5 of his army surviving and his lands being overrun with Stark infantry, Lord Tully was on the ropes, pumping out Hussar regiments and Elite skirmisher squads from positions deep in Lannister territory.\nMeanwhile the Lannister army battled against the infantry of Lord Stark, and Lord Loki's cavalry. The battle of the sea having been won by Lord Loki in the sacrificial attack by Lord Greyjoy's fleet, Lord Loki returned the favour sailing his fleet into Kings Landing and wreaking havoc on the\nmilitary training grounds located there until finally succumbing to the fortifications. Meanwhile the land battle was heating up with the new Camel companies of Lord Greyjoys Cavalry fighting against the Paladin company and Hussar hordes pouring out of the Vale stables.\n\n\nThe South was slowly consolidating their efforts from chaotic to organised, while the north pushed deeper into their lands and holdings. Fuelled by the resources gathered by Lord Lokis villager army mentioned early in this story, Lord Loki was able to simultaneously keep up\nan unending flow of cavalry galloping into the lowlands and a solid tribute to his Ally Lord Stark kept the infantry of the North streaming south. For a while.\n\n\nFinally, the armies of infantry from Lord Stark start to buckle under the combined might of Lannister and Tully and all seems lost for the North, when suddenly a great uproar sweeps the Lords; Lord Starks forces, having pillaged the monasteries of Tully and Lannister has made off with 6 relics, the last\n2 of which are currently being taken North by a pair of monks and a small squad of infantry combined with the 3 he already has in his monasteries this will place him at 9 relics ready to be simultaneously offered, fulfilling the prophecy and ending them all.\nThe armies of the south begin to flood towards the monks and the small squad of infantry, ready to grind them into dust and retrieve the relic, when a signal flare goes off focussing the attention of all the lords on a single monastery owned by Lord Stark located at Greywater Watch. Standing beside it \nis a Vale monk, who, under the eyes of the world, deposits a single relic into the Monastery, thus preparing it for tribute and bringing the ready relic count to 8 for Lord Stark.\nPanic ensues, confusion abounds, whereas before the 2 stolen relics were a threat that increased the danger and made the war harder, now they were an impending doom racing towards the Lords of the South.\nThe armies of the south race after the small group with reckless abandon, ignoring enemy troops and fortifications, taking damage they would not have otherwise. Condemnations fall on Lord Loki from the Southern lords in a flood of anger and fear.\n\n\nLord Stark sends a message to Lord Loki; \"But why? this victory can only have one winner, you'll die if this happens\"\nLord Loki replies with but 2 words, one for each relic; \"I know\"\nThe Paladins of the Vale, and hordes of Hussar slam into the pursuing forces of the south cutting them, and being cut to pieces in a simultaneous slaughter of both sides, the ringing cries of \"The King in the North\" ringing across the din of the battlefield of Seagard.\nThe small squad of Stark Infantry, their wards the Monks, and the precious cargo of 2 relics, now safely arriving at the monastery of the Twins, make their tribute to the gods and the game ends. Lord Stark ascends and the other lords die.\n\n\n\nThis game was an Age of Empires 2 Multiplayer custom map where I and 7 other players fought with intrigue and armies to either annihilate the other 7 or bank 10 relics in our monasteries.\nThe Relics showed up every 10 years, so whoever had kings landing had a good chance of getting the win via relics victory unless unseated as happened in our match.\nI didn't know the rules and the player in Starks role gave me the rundown on how this map worked as well as backing me up in arguments. The others did exactly as the story goes trying to backstab us.\nHis infantry put up a good fight but eventually he was getting overrun and I held off 3 armies to let him win the game as a thank you for his friendliness.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention map was a recreation of A Game of Thrones' Westeros continent",

        "text": "**Foreward**:  \nFirst, I'm not a *great* Civilization player. I've been into the series since the very first, but I've never really ascended past King difficulty (though I'm playing on Prince in this story). So if you're a hardcore player you'll probably pick up on a few strategic inefficiencies on my part. Also this story goes in and out of a \"roleplaying\" tone, sorry if it's weird.  \n\n**I was Trajan, emperor of Rome.**  \nI was going for a scientific victory, so naturally throughout most of the game I was many turns ahead of the rest of the world.  I managed to establish a strong foothold on the northeastern part of my continent and maintained a dominant influence on the city states to my west. To their south lay my close friend, Hojo Tokimune of Japan.  \nThe borders of one of my cities touched his borders, but other than that we had no reason to be rivals. He criticized my lack of culture and faith early in the game, and I made it a point to keep our relations strong. I built a thriving Theatre district in my capital to keep him happy (and to make sure I wasn't in a political stone age) as well as a holy site, and before long he was praising the glory of my nation.  \nIt wasn't long before we were declared friends!  \n\nBut meanwhile, farther south on the other side of his borders, lurked my boastful rival Frederick Barbarossa of Germany. Constantly, ever since my first scout stumbled upon his, he had been threatening me with violence. I also noticed that his relationship with Japan was no better!   \nMy friend Hojo Tokimune denounced him publicly, and I would have as well (had Germany not already denounced me, preempting my need to do so).  \nFrom then on, every few turns or so Japan would offer me a deal. Ally with them and go to war with Germany. I was technologically superior to both so I would have been a powerful ally or enemy, but I was choosing to spend my resources elsewhere. My cities were thriving and improving turn by turn, and I had no interest in this conflict. As much of a loudmouth as Mr Barbarossa was, I could ignore him.  \nThe requests went on, every few turns. Please help us to attack Germany, my friend asked. We renewed our declaration of friendship whenever we needed to, but I never honored his request. Instead I gave him gifts of iron and horses to aid in his own ventures against the southern brutes, but these did not appear to help.  \n\nNot a sword was crossed, not a shot fired. For several eras, all nations had existed peacefully despite the tension.  \n\n**Until one fateful turn changed everything.**  \nThe turn after my latest denial of Japan's request for joint war against Germany, Frederick Barbarossa had the gall to settle a German city on my lands. On my corner of the continent there was one space available to settle on. Just one measly hex that I had left open, and they landed their settler and took it!  \n\nI immediately asked Frederick to cease settling near my cities and he rebuked my request. I then denounced him publicly (time enough had passed that I could do so). My military had grown significantly in strength by this time so I felt emboldened enough to make a demand; give me this city that you so rudely founded on my territory! Predictably, he refused.  \n\nThis forced my hand. Within only two bloody turns, the city was mine. He tried to wrest control back from me, but was soon begging for mercy and offering financial tribute. I signed a treaty and left him alone, hoping he'd learned a lesson.  \n\nOthers in the world were a bit shocked by this conflict. My reputation as a peaceful nation was sullied, but I could understand why. They didn't know the context of what brought me to that point.  \nBut you know who did? My best friend, the enemy of my enemy, Hojo Tokimune. His tone turned cold with me from that point and he soon refused to renew our declaration of friendship. I was stunned by this; I had struck a small but humbling blow against his greatest enemy, and his reaction was to treat me as a warmongering brute.  \nI left him alone for a few turns, hoping he'd cool off.  \n\n**Before long, I felt the sting of betrayal.**  \nAn itchy, brief and mostly harmless sting, but a sting nonetheless. A joint attack by Japan and Germany (and if we're being honest, more the former than the latter) struck at my southwesternmost city. A motley crew of Samurai, Anti-tank Gunners, and Catapults marched toward my city.  \n\nI was offended that he'd send this anachronistic mix of poorly trained cosplayers to die on my land. Did he honestly think they'd march over my well-placed encampment, surrounded by hills in a mountain pass, as my field cannons decimated them turn by turn? Did he think that a single katana would cross with the bayonets of my industrial-era infantry?  \nWhatever he thought, he was wrong. And he was apparently unaware of my *extremely* deep pockets.  \n\n**I funded an army of volunteers to strike back.**  \nA dozen or so units were ready to march by the end of the next turn. While Hojo begged for peace and offered tribute, I spent the next few turns bringing my forces into position. We surrounded the great city of Kyoto, marveled at the archictecture and brilliant wonders that were built there, and quickly tore down the walls.  \nWithout losing a single unit in the battle, the city was mine.  \n\nMeanwhile, Germany had half-heartedly sent a few caravels to try to plunder my trade routes. My submarines took care of them, and once again his pathetic attempt to make good on his word ended with him owing me tribute for 30 turns.  \n\nAs the dust settled around Kyoto, Hojo begged for peace. But no, old friend, there would be no peace. Your capital is next, I thought to myself. In the span of a few turns, it was mine as well.  \n\n**I was a changed man.**  \nI had tried my hand at peace, and found my skills were greater used elsewhere. Since then, I've allowed Japan to keep a single city of their own which is no threat to me. I make sure of this every turn when I have my forces pillage their every improvement.  \nGermany has been quiet ever since as I continue to build my spaceports and prepare for a Martian colonization. I'm focusing on accomplishing what I originally sought out to do, but I still eagerly await the next time Mr Barbarossa feels foolhardy enough to threaten the once-peaceful Roman empire to his north.",

        "text": "This story comes paired with **[a comic](http://www.handbookofheroes.com/archives/comic/key-item)**. It's a second-hand tale courtesy of my artist, Laurel. It made an impression on me though, so I wanted to share. Ahem:\n\nIf you’ve never heard of Dark Sun, you should do yourself a favor and give it a look. It’s a dark fantasy, planetary romance with Dying Earth overtones, and [the art](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/524387950343562796/) kicks more ass than a tarrasque with caster levels. For purposes of this conversation however, the important point is that the bleak wasteland of Athas is a desert setting.\n\nIt was a college gaming club, and Laurel had made an elf PC. The class doesn’t really matter, because elves get “desert craft” as a freaking racial ability. You see, Dark Sun elves are a nomadic lot, and they make their living either through herding, raiding, or trading out in the wastes.\n\n“Is there anything else anybody wants to do before you set out?” says the DM.\n\nNope. They were all set to trek through the desert and kill its inhabitants.\n\n“OK then. You sleep peacefully the first night, but wake to catastrophe! All of your water has evaporated due to the extreme heat of the desert!”\n\nI wasn’t there, but I like to imagine the players looking at this schmuck like [the “His Master’s Voice” dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Master%27s_Voice).\n\n“What… What do you mean ‘evaporated?'”\n\n“I mean that you are in danger of dehydration. Make a Fortitude save.”\n\nThe way Laurel tells it, this DM expected the party to bury their water. You know. So it wouldn’t evaporate through their water skins.\n\n“Wouldn’t my elf know to do that? I mean, ignoring the fact that we aren’t carrying water around in open containers, I’ve lived in the desert my whole life.”\n\n“Then you should have declared that you bury your water.”\n\nLesson learned. Don’t be like that Dark Sun DM. Assume that the PCs are at least somewhat competent. Because “Gotcha” DMs suck, and we all should strive not to.",

Our characters are part of an independent small business, a private investigation agency called Hooded Lantern Inquiry. \n\n&gt; A dragonborn warlock sits, nervously drumming his hands on his legs. A tiefling fighter polishes her blade in the dusk.  A gnomish rogue idly whittles with his dagger on the road to Greenest. The dragonborn notices the traffic picking up on the way otu of town. Soon all three can see a steady stream of fleeing townsfolk.\n\n&gt; The gnome, Rickart, stops a young man and asks what is happening.  He hears '...overrun...' before the young man flees.\n\n&gt; The dragonborn suddenly stands and shouts \"Over there!\" and starts stalking towards the town, and his companions chase after him, sensing trouble. 'Nez! Come back!' He strides forward, purpose in his step and a wild look in his eye.\n\nMy son rolled a dragonborn warlock whose patron is one of the Great Old Ones. Strictly speaking, he doesn't know what is happening to him - only that he can now access magics, and sometimes he is... compelled to act. His compulsions manifest like OCD.\n\n&gt; Kobolds begin haring out of the town, and Nez the dragonborn shouts for them to halt (but they pay him no heed).  Rickart the gnome pulls Nez down just as pellets fly over their heads. The battle has begun.\n\n&gt; Alice divers for cover in the shrubs, but Nez immediately stands and whispers under his breath.  One of the kobolds approaching him stiffens, and drops dead.  \n\nDIssonant Whispers is pretty good.\n\n&gt; Kobold snipers fire stone pellets with slings at Nez, and bloody him badly for his trouble. Nez seems unfazed.  Alice is both frightened for Nez, and furious at him as she attempts to tackle him but is stopped to immobility by his heavy frame.She begins scuffling with the nearest kobold, and Nez vaporises another with an eldritch blast.\n\n&gt; Rickart, still prone, rolls to the scrub and into deep cover, using his size to dissolve into the growth.  He stalks the snipers, passing his rapier through one like a kabob while his companion looks elsewhere, unaware of the doom hiding under his nose.\n\n&gt; Alice scuffles with the kobolds, and Nez tries to bring his quarterstaff to bear, but to no avail - these guys are armoured and hearty.  Alice receives a couple of stab wounds for her trouble, and both are looking ready to drop.  This does not stop them bickering.\n\nThe RP was strong. Alice was properly pissed off at the Warlock, and he was playing up the crazy.  It was excellent.  \n\n&gt; A silent blade dispatches the other sniper and the rogue moves under cover to position himself for an arrow shot, should it become necessary. It does not.\n\n&gt; Alice, tired of her blows clanging off various pieces of the final kobold's armour, decides she has had enough.  The kobold is still giggling smugly when her blade passes through his head.\n\n&gt; Investigating the bodies turns up a wealth of information, but they know how to look - the are Hooded Lantern Inquiry, after all.\n\nNatural 20 on investigation, and I reaped the benefits. I am deliriously happy with how the first mini-session went, and am GREATLY looking forward to the next.",

        "text": "So I was playing Lost Mines of Phandelver (I think that's how it's spelled? Whatever.) With my two brothers and one of my brother's friends. The party was Faylore (Me) the Blue Dragonborn Druid, Twist (my little brother) the Feral Tiefling Barbarian, Warryn (big brother's DMPC) the Halfling Cleric of the Grave, and Lajos (little brother's friend) the Human Fighter. So we were in the mines, had just gotten out of a pretty big encounter. I was already down most of my hit points, when we investigate a room and find this temple. \n\nMy dumb ass associates temple in a dungeon with a resting place, and I call out to see if anyone is there. Whoops, it's Nezznar's lair (essentially that campaign's big bad) and his spider crew gets a surprise round, which they use to tie us all up. The rest of the party uses their actions to free themselves, but I don't want to just waste a turn, so I use Thunderwave so I can burst out of the webs. I spoke to my brother about it, he was a bit reluctant but upon looking in the book we saw that the webs were given an HP score. Thunderwave damage beats spider web, I get an aoe that does some chip damage off on spiders.\n\nAfter doing that, things quickly start to go to hell. We aren't killing the spiders fast enough (I find out later that my brother was worried the combat would be too easy otherwise and beefed up the number of spiders considering we had 4 level 5 adventurers) and to put a nice cherry on top, Twist gets hit with a suggestion of \"Your friend hurt you, I think you should kill him.\" To clarify, Twist and Lajos were both caught in the Thunderwave when I used it.\n\nTwist hits me twice and sets me back to 7 HP, I go into genius druid mode, wild shape into Giant Spider, web him up to buy me time, and climb 15 feet up the wall. Here comes the part that gets me a bit triggered. Without any orders being given from big bad, the spider breaks Twist's web. Another spider gets a nat 20 on me, bringing my spider form down to 5 HP. Big bad hits me with a ray of frost that breaks right through my remaining Spider HP and deals enough damage to knock me unconscious as well. Twist then comes over, gets two attacks, hits, instant criticals, essentially 4 lost saving throws. Dead Faylore.\n\nThe combat wasn't over though. With his suggestion complete, Twist awoke to find that he had slaughtered his closest friend at the whim of some fucking wizard. Needless to say, he was not a happy Barbarian. He charged Nezznar, breaking into a Frenzied Rage, the bites of the spiders' attacks of opportunity not even fazing him. He was singleminded in his goal, and his goal was one thing alone: End. Nezznar. Three attacks with his sword, Talon, brought the Drow to his end, leaving not a trace of him.\n\nWith the proverbial serpent's head chopped off, the spiders lost resolve and tried to flee, only to be picked off one by one by the party and the zombified form of Faylore. The cleric did it after I died, and while I was in control, it was still not Faylore. I spoke in zombie moans for the rest of the session.\n\nThis isn't my first PC death, but it is one that felt totally out of my hands. The first was me killing off my own DMPC so that I wasn't punishing my players directly for failing a mass perception check (can add that story later if you'd like to see it.) I just felt like my DM stacked literally everything against me in that final round, and it wasn't as fun as it could have been. Do you guys have similar stories?",

        "text": "Hello, First post so I'm not sure if I'm posting this on the right subreddit or format in general.\n\nToday, I jumped into a Duo game of PUBG, and was matched with someone who was Asian. I was kinda upset because its hard to communicate and they usually take up a lot of NA Servers, But I have a huge respect for them after this experience. To start off, I've never won a single game of PUBG. I've gotten in 7th place before in Solo, But this time was different. We started off jumping at the school, then quickly ran off after school was getting crammed down with people and lots of shooting was occurring.\n\nSo me and my friend run to a nearby town and stack up on the houses. We did the usual looting and running, but then we found a buggy. We drove this buggy until we crashed and got stuck. I hopped out and so did he, we went on our Mary go way down to the play zone. While running through what looked like a cornfield, the plane flew overhead and dropped right on us. I saw this as a sign of luck, I gave him my Kar and he covered me while I got the drop. I got a SAW Machine gun and we ran to a nearby house. I saw a guy to our right across the field in another house, and decided to prone through the field. I got to the rock and all the sudden the walls starting closing it. I crouched and ran to the rock and I was shot at.\n\nI was hit a couple times, My adrenaline started pumping irl and before I knew it I made use of my new found habit of smoke grenades. I threw a smoke and hid behind a tree. I bandaged myself all I could then threw a stun up the hill. I ran to the side of the hill and climbed up. I meant the guy on top of the hill. Him not having a clue where I was until the last second. I sprayed him with my new machine gun and he went down. Me and my new found friend got stacked and then we stole the guys car and made our way to the play zone. In the back of my mind I thought we weren't gonna make it, due to the blue wall tearing us apart.\n\nWe got to a little shack and stayed put. We got ready for a huge fight. After the playzone closed in even more. We ran across another field, to 1 single tree and a couple of bushes. I was hit by a sniper behind a hay bale and was knocked down. My friend went full sniper mode and sniped the guy with 1 shot. He then revived me up, I was in awe at his sniping skills. We let the zone shrink in, eventually getting behind a wall. 8 People were left, and that's when it happened. On the left of us, a team approached and we fired at them. They got hit a couple times, but on the right of the wall a guy came up and sprayed both of us.\n\nIt wasn't a good ending, but 5th place for the first time ever was amazing to me.\n\nI hope one day I can win 1st, but for now I just want to let you guys know.\n\nIn PUBG, If you are playing duo and have an international partner. Do not judge them, and don't hold a grudge. They are just like us, the only difference is they have a different language. So, at the end of the day. I want to thank all of you international players for trying the best you can with english or whatever your partner's language is. It means a lot.\n\nGoodluck out there fellow gamers.",

        "text": "(Assorted spoilers for Lost Mine of Phandelver)\n\nSo, the group I play with is a bit silly. Probably my fault, really: it started out with me DMing them through LMoP, and then swapping in as the cartoonish Nabroím Süolhammer, a musclebound, beer- and battle-loving Dwarven Cleric of Hanseath. There were two problems with this:\n\n1, The character I was swapping in for, a wizard/knowledge-cleric multi, was very much the brains of the operation, and his disappearance combined with Nabroím's introduction left the party somewhat wanting for sound judgement.\n\n2, The player that was swapping out to DM enjoys running a simulationist, consequence-heavy game, which contrasts a bit with the comparatively doofy way I let things play out during the Phandelver content.\n\nThe biggest consequence of this is that the plot since I swapped in has largely been about resolving the fallout of the more reckless actions the party took during my tenure. Like murdering Halia when they found out she was trying to take over the town, bringing the Zhentarim down on our heads. Or using the Flameskull's smoldering remains to dubiously rekindle the Forge of Spells' matching green flames with an exceptionally high Arcana check. To make a long story short, the side effects of that last shenanigan eventually ripped a portal in the middle of the mine, and the party is now in Sigil after considerable misadventures.\n\nNow, going back to that judgement problem... Our Drow storm sorceress is a touch naive in-character, so a few sessions ago when she ran across an ominous, obviously powerful gem-studded magic skull in a Sigil shop at a reasonable price, she bought it without hesitation. Slightly overconfident, Nabroím offered to spend his evening short-resting with the item to determine its effects since the party lacks Identify. Well, lacked, but I'm getting to that...\n\nSee, Nabroím, while a little paranoid, was sure he could handle whatever the skull might throw at him if it was cursed. Detect Magic only marked it with Divination effects, he had Remove Curse prepared, and Kuhwreak the Kenku arcane trickster was on hand with the Jade Frog, a MacGuffin that destroys magic items (and may eventually free a dangerous elder god; but that is another story). Between the two, what could go wrong?\n\nWell, quite a bit as it happens. Once he'd managed to get a sense of the skull's magic, its curse activated, forming an unwitting hivemind between Nabroím and the eleven nearest unfamiliar minds- the stable boy, all of the Inn's NPC patrons, its proprietor, and his crew. Realizing his mistake, Nabroím tried to use his Remove Curse... but, failing a concentration check, moved some other body's hands in the needed gesture. The effect quickly progressed into psychic bleedover, Nabroím seizing from information overload at the curse's center and sending his nearby companions into a panic. After a bit of fumbling, the Kenku grabbed the skull... but the Frog didn't activate. Kuhwreak implored the frog to help, and it responded in bemusement: _You asked me not to inflict disorder on your flock, little bird_. Kuhwreak insisted, not dwelling on what this might mean; and the skull shattered into twelve oblong shards.\n\nNow, the DM knows that I have a long backlog of character concepts I'd love to play, and that I'm ready for Nabroím to kick the bucket with zero reservations; so I was not at all surprised when he explained that he was rolling a d12 to determine which of the connected minds would survive. We were all, however, surprised when he rolled a 1. In the taproom below, eleven unwitting victims fell dead. My character lives; but he did not escape unscathed.\n\nNabroím, my goofy frat-boyish half-joke character, now carries the living memory of eight dwarves, two humans, a half-elf, and a githzerai- not just their knowledge and skills (and wizard familiar?), but their philosophies, hopes, and dreams. Notably among those dwarves, the bar's proprietor was Important. In the cosmic sense. As in, \"9,000 years old, repeatedly turned down godhood, and took an active hand in the betterment of the multiverse\" important. Whoops.\n\nThe DM had intended him to be a quest giver and a much-needed benefactor to the party. Looks like that may be Nabroím's job now; or, more broadly, carrying on for and repaying all of the lives ended by his carelessness. Where things go from here will depend a lot on the briefing I get from my DM and how Nabroím's mind settles after a much needed long rest; but however things go from here, my role in this crazy campaign just got a lot more interesting...",

        "text": "(Hello, this is something I've cooked up to pass the time: A solo campaign with myself! The dice rolls are done via a phone app, and my character sheet and spells are stored in the same way, so that I can write all this on mobile. I decided to use the hook from the Lost Mines of Phandelver to test Savant, with many changes to the tale to suit my tastes. Hope you enjoy!)\n\nDM: Your tale begins in the early pre-dawn of the day of Quardos, 4th day of the week. Cor and yourself have just finished chopping up firewood out back, enjoying the cool autumn breeze. The Silvermare inn is located in the eastern ward of Savron, by the open fields within the city that generate some of the food for the city. The river Dolores flows from the Phandelver mountains to the east and through the city, dividing it into the northern and southern halves. \n\nAs you and your father busy yourselves preparing the inn for the arrival of the lunch time crowd, Cor turns to you as you serve breakfast to your guests. \"Working this week?\"\n\nPC: \"No... I mean, I plan to pay the notice board a visit later tomorrow. Maybe I'll find something then,\"\n\nDM: \"No need,\" Cor tells you, \"Gundren is coming by. Got a job,\" and with that he returns to his duties.\n\nPC: Can i think back and recall what i know of Gundren?\n\nDM: Sure, roll a History check.\n\n(9+3=12)\n\nDM: From what you can recall, Gundren is a dwarven male who has popped by the Silvermare Inn a number of times through the years. You sort of know of him, but didn't realize that he and Cor were friends of any kind.\n\nPC: Cool. I don't suppose I would continue chatting with Cor, right? After all he is a man of few words.\n\nDM: Yeap, as soon as he's turned away he busies himself in the kitchen. Left alone in the dining hall, a boisterous man in opulent clothing bursts through the front doors! \"I hear there is a man here who can identify magical items! Where is this supposed wizard, living in this... Sty?\"\n\nPC: I assess him before speaking with him. Insight or Perception?\n\nDM: Err... Perception.\n\n(15+1=16)\n\nDM: The man's eyes flick between the various patrons, unsteady and betraying the overt confidence he projects. He has a nervous twitch to his eye that conveys this man doesn't fully know why he's come here. The two bodyguards behind him rolled their eyes when he gave his speech, implying that perhaps this man isn't well respected and maybe a little full of himself.\n\nPC: Cool, easily swindled then. Is he nobility?\n\nDM: There is a gold amulet worn about his neck bearing the image of a dog. You recognize this as the crest of the house Ceres, one of the noble houses of Savron. They are famed for their initiatives taking care of animals within the city, and contribute to the army of the city by rearing war animals. This is fairly common knowledge.\n\nPC: Do I know anything else about this man perhaps? Something that gives me an edge?\n\nDM: Roll a history check.\n\n(NAT20+3=23)\n\nDM: Wow, okay. Erm. The house Ceres has Lord Casimir and Lady Daenys Ceres, along with their 5 children. The youngest, Eamon, stands before you this day. Eamon is infamous for severely overcompensating for his age, perpetually seeking glory to improve his standing within his house.\n\nPC: ... Okay. Erm.\n\nDM: \"Well? Is there truly a wizard in this sad hovel? I suppose it was too much to hope for,\"\n\nPC: \"Lord Ceres! It is an honour to meet you! I am Savant, the wizard that you have indeed heard of! Please, may i invite your party to be seated? You will be served immediately,\"\n\nDM: \"Ah, good, respect and service as we deserve! Do serve us your very best, surely nothing else would befit us,\"\n\nPC: ... Dicks. Okay, we serve them up breakfast, and some ale.\n\nDM: In the morning?!\n\nPC: Fine, coffee. We serve them each a mug of coffee, set a bowl of sugar on the table, and put a platter of food for each of them. Scrambled eggs, sausages, and some bread.\n\nDM: Okay, no performance check needed, it's absolutely delicious, but the men make a show of tolerating the food.\n\nPC: ... Dicks. \"So, my lord...\"\n\nDM: \"Speak when you're spoken to, boy!\"\n\nPC: Is he... older than me?\n\nDM: Nah he looks about your age. He's a dick. \"I have in my possession a circlet, recently repossessed by myself in a raid through the Muire Tomb, just north of the city. There were reports of undead rising in the tomb, so we set out to rid the land of their foul existance! Valiantly, i triumphed, and from the corpse of Lord Muire i obtained this circlet!\"\n\nPC: ... Lying?\n\nDM: Insight check.\n\n(17+1=18)\n\nDM: Yeah, absolutely, lying through his teeth, though it isn't clear if he's lying about the circlet or the circumstances of how he obtained it. Suffice to say this guy is absolutely bluffing and full of bravado.\n\nPC: \"Most impressive, my lord. We of the city thank you for this great service you have done for us at great personal risk. May I see this circlet?\"\n\nDM: He grabs a circlet from his pack and slaps it on the table, leaning closer to you, eagerness plain on his face. \"Tell me, wizard, do you know what this is?\"\n\nPC: I grab my spellbook, an owl feather, and a really nice pearl from my component pouch, both pure white. I cast \"Identify\" as a ritual from my spellbook! I prick my finger to draw blood, then press the blood on to the metal ring that circles the top of the table, setting up the ritual space. I'll run the pearl along the feather, whispering: \"Imparare,\"\n\nThe feather and pearl briefly flash with power, and then I place the tip of the feather on a small piece of parchment. I then run the pearl along the object, making sure to rub it all over the little nooks and bumps, and as it does so the feather begins scratching text on to the parchment in common visible only to myself. As soon as I am done running the pearl over the circlet I quickly toss it back into my component pouch and watch as the feather finishes scratching on the parchment, then I keep the feather as well. What do I see on the parchment?\n\nDM: It is a simple circlet, with no magical properties. Eamon leans in, his eyes aglow with wonder that he can barely keep in check, even his bodyguards have a look of awe in their eyes. \"So, what magic does this circlet wield?\"\n\nPC: Shit. History, do I know what the Muire crest looks like?\n\nDM: Roll History check.\n\n(15+3=18)\n\nDM: Sure, you know it. It looks like... A bolt of lightning.\n\nPC: I cast \"Prestidigitation\". I'll grab the circlet, tracing the lines, and as soon as my finger is over one of the gems (I'm assuming there are gems) I'll whisper: \"Evocare,\". I make the symbol of the Muire family appear faintly within the gem, shimmering with an azure light.\n\nDM: Eamon turns pale and leans back, his hands now slightly shaking. His eyes now nervously dart to every corner of the room, while the guards behind him look genuinely impressed.\n\nPC: I look Eamon in the eye, trying to hold his gaze. I say somberly, \"I have revealed the magic in this circlet. It bears a magical signature marking it as one of the royal accessories of the family, not defensive or protective but simply a mark to identify which house this circlet belongs to.\"\n\nDM: Deception check.\n\n(13+3=16)\n\nDM: Eamon licks his lips, sweat beginning to bead on his brow. He seems unnaturally thrown off by the information, and seems to be desperate to get out of the inn at the moment. He stands and holds out his hand to you, \"Very well, your service is appreciated!\"\n\nPC: I stand and hold the circlet close, holding his gaze, \"Payment for identification is 2 gold pieces, as stated on the sign outside.\"\n\nDM: ... You should probably have asked for payment before telling him stuff, eh? Roll... Persuasion.\n\n(NAT1+3=4)\n\nPC: Shit.\n\nDM: A sudden fire burns in Eamon’s eyes, the awe and wonder on his face swiftly replaced by rage. The two guards behind him stand, their hands flying to the pommels of their longswords. “Peasant wizard, I will not ask again. Give me the circlet,”\n\nPC: I cast “Prestidigitation”. I say, “Evocare,” and dismiss the Muire symbol from the gem and begin to heat up the circlet. I then place the circlet on the table, and still looking Eamon in the eye I growl, “You do not come into the house of a wizard and make a mockery of him. Son of Casimir, lord of Ceres, do not test my patience. My request is fair and just for services rendered,” The circlet should now heat up enough to begin to score the wood of the table.\n\nDM: Nice. Intimidation.\n\n(16+3=19)\n\nDM: At the smell of burned wood, Eamon quickly glances at the smoke rising around the circlet, and his face pales. He reaches wordlessly into his belt pouch and tosses 2 gold pieces on the table. One of the guards grabs a handkerchief and gingerly picks up the now heated circlet, tossing it into Eamon’s pack. Without another word, the three men turn and leave the inn. From behind you, you hear a boisterous laugh and clapping from the bar, and when you turn you find a ginger-haired dwarf sitting on the bar stool, laughing and clapping at you.\n\n“Good show, lad! Good show! Did ya see that, Sildar? My gods, the balls on that boy!” The dwarf laughs and jabs and elbow at the human man next to him, a small smile on his old face, framed by long white hair. The dwarf and man and both dressed in chainmail armour, the former wielding a maul while the man has a sword and shield strapped to his belt and back respectively. Behind the bar, Cor gazes at you expressionless.\n\nPC: Is he proud?\n\nDM: Insight check.\n\n(NAT1+1=2)\n\nDM: You have no idea, his poker face is amazing.\n\nPC: Damn it. Savant is a little stung by the lack of pride on Cor’s face, and he quickly scoops up the 2 gold pieces and tucks them into his belt pouch.\n\nDM: Fair enough. The dwarf approaches your table now, a smile plastered on his face, “Young Savant! Oh, how you never cease to amaze me! Sent a noble running out of the tavern with his tail between his legs, never thought I’d see the day!”\n\nPC: “And you must be uncle Gundren, hello sir,”\n\nDM: “Bah, just call me Gundren, boy. Never did like the word “Uncle”. In any case, allow me to introduce my new friend, Sildar Hallwinter!” The white-haired man steps up to you, his hand held out for a shake with that quiet smile still on his face.\n\n“It is a pleasure to meet you, Savant,” Sildar says, his voice smooth though old, “Gundren sung your praises ceaselessly on our trip here,”\n\nPC: I grab his hand in a shake. “The honour is mine, Mister Hallwinter. Now, what job do you have for me, Gundren?”\n\nDM: “Call him “Sildar”, boy! Formalities are for the posh! So, I’ve stumbled across something big in the town of Phandalin, and I’m making my way there now to meet up with my brothers for a little… Expedition. I need you and Sildar here to gather some supplies from the city, transport it to Phandalin, and then join us on this venture. The payment will be 50 gold pieces. What say you?”\n\nPC: “Phandalin? Where is this town, exactly?”\n\nDM: History check.\n\n(15+3=18)\n\nDM: Phandalin is a small mining town nestled close to the Phandelver mountain ranges to the south east of Savron. Rumour has it that the town used to be a bustling trade-stop because of a mystical artifact known as the “Spell Forge”, a relic that enabled the wizards of old to create magical items by the dozen.\n\nPC: That story... Would make Savant go nuts.\n\nDM: Yeap. “So boy, are you in?”\n\nPC: “Onwards to Phandalin!”",

Would you like to describe yourself, and maybe a bit about your history?\n\nPC: My name is Savant, a 17-year-old male, sharp features with a scrawny build. About 1.68m tall (5.5 feet), unkempt short brown hair that sticks up every which way. Finally he likes to dress in dark blue traveler's clothes and often wears a traveller's brown cloak, wielding a quarterstaff covered in runes he has etched into it over the years.\n\nOrphaned and left at the doorstep of the Silvermare inn within the city of Savron, the boy was raised by the innkeep Cor, a man of few words who had built the inn from the ground up. Cor loved the boy as his own, and over the years bought many books for the boy's ever growing appetite for knowledge. In particular, Savant was clearly in love with magic, and would inhale any fable or theory on the subject, eagerly copying spells and attempting to cast them.\n\nPut to work from the age of 4, Savant learned many tricks of the trade, striking up conversations with strangers and mastering the art of learning without being seen. Eventually, at the age of 12, he cast his very first spell, Mage Hand, and to his great delight he began to use the spell to swiftly deliver drinks to multiple tables as a trick.\n\nNow 17, Cor has begun slapping pieces of parchment from the city notice board on his desk, sending the boy out on jobs and errands throughout the city and hopefully beyond. It's high time the kid expanded his horizons, and tested his mettle against the trials of the world.\n\nDM: Orphan boy background? Not the most original.\n\nPC: Yeah, but it gives you mystery to work with, right? And Cor was a nice man so he ain't a broody character, but charismatic and intelligent!\n\nDM: Alrighty, you got it. Also you start this at level 2, so be sure to pick your spells and stuff properly. You have 3 cantrips, 8 level 1 spells, and 3 level 1 spell slots. And your school...?\n\nPC: Divination, I think Savant would have used rituals like Identify or spells like Minor Illusion to perform in the inn a little bit, to bring in more coin. The inn is his life, after all.\n\nDM: Okay, intelligent and charismatic. [Matt Colville's character creation tips](https://youtu.be/iFJwcLjx1uI) is really something. Okay, let's roll out!",

        "text": "It is St. Grimble's Eve and the tavern, the Grey Echidna, is packed with carousing denizens meaning that an unlikely trio of Elvenfolk are forced by proximity to make each other's acquaintance: a young Wizard travelling far from his political father's sphere of influence, a wise and mysterious Priest from a faraway land and a particularly hairy Helfling (progeny of an Elf and a halfling, mathematically a 5/8th-ling.)\n\nSuccumbing to a weaker constitution and smaller bladder, the Helfing is approached by a deposed Kobold prince on the way back from the privvy - the prince offers great rewards to whomever can help him reclaim the stolen Kobold Lantern from his usurping sister in a warren some days march away. The claims might seem farfetched or dubious to many but not this newly-formed trio! They commit to the task with great gusto and an equally impressive lack of suspicion, forethought or questioning.\n\nSetting off first thing in the morning (first thing after the Wizard drank a herbal hangover cure and the Helfling spent a few hours tending her bountiful hair, so midday) the group come across a merchant of the arcane, selling their wares safely outside the settlement limits. They came away with arms full of rare and powerful items - how did the merchant come across items of such power? Are they all what they appear to be? Hey, probably - let's just use them and find out! This almost certainly won't come back to bite them in the proverbial. Also they purchase a sassy, talking snake familiar with the merchant who is sure to be a valued member of the party until the very end.\n\nAfter days of travel, the party spy the notorious Dwarf mercenary Winky Padoran and his Orc-ish bodyguards. Could the infamous Winky be upon the same mission? Surely crossing this Dwarf's path will lead to an epic tale of complications, compromise, adventure and danger...oh, wait, the Priest talked him around to helping out instead. The Priest is very persuasive. They even give their dear friend Ssssidney the talking snake to Winky as a peaceful gift where he is rapidly and suddenly eaten by an Orc bodyguard.\n\nPushing onwards to the Kobold warren, the party come across a Dark Elf Hunter bleeding to death on the path...this mythical \"Horn Beast\" that he refers to...could it, in fact, be a rare and beautiful Unicorn? How will the party react to this surprise? Turns out, with violence. Lots of violence. \n\nArmed now with powdered Unicorn horn, all the better to make foes fall under their thrall, the party follow the maps and instructions of Winky Padoran and find an opening into the Kobold's Grog kitchen. Using some of the magical, glamoured items that they bought from the travelling merchant who certainly had no nefarious intentions, the party spike the Grog and infiltrate the lair. In Kobold form they are able to secure an audience with the Princess of the Kobolds and this meeting ends with her lying unconscious, her guards prevented from interfering by some divinely-summoned tree roots.\n\nWith the Lantern in hand, ensuring the obedience of the Kobolds, the party leave the warren. Winky makes a grab to snatch the lantern away but is easily stopped and summarily executed by the Kobold guards. The Kobold who sent the party on this quest is waiting for them outside and gratefully receives the sacred Lantern. Good to his word, he rewards the party with their own weight in ill-gotten gold and some cool arcane items. Less good to his word, it is starting to look a lot like he wasn't the rightful ruler of this warren at all and is actually discussing plans to increase raids on the surrounding areas with his new subjects...ah well, GOLD AND LOOT! Huzzah!\n",

        "text": "DM - /u/wertheoutsiders, tagging for any corrections and additions\n\nAnd no Curse of Strahd spoilers please, I'm currently a player in the campaign, even though we are so far off of the storyline, I doubt any spoilers will matter, but still, just in case.\n\nWe (me, a Lingering Soul, a Tabaxi Ranger, a Tiefling Cleric, an Aarakocra Fighter, a Gnome Bard, and a Human? Wizard?) are a group of sellswords and other misplaced miscreants who were mysteriously transported to the land of Barovia.\n\nLink to our previous installment https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7vyezt/clubbing_in_barovia/\n\nAt the start of this session we had just bartered our way into Krezk by promising the Burgermeister that we would raise his dead son back to life, though other than the chaotic good Gnome and possibly the Wizard (of questionable background), we had no intention of actually delivering on that promise. See, as a Lingering Soul, I can possess bodies, so our plan was for me to possess the son, squeeze every bit of help and loot out of the town that we could, then leave it high and dry. After an impressive performance by our Cleric, I possessed the son's corpse and, among other things, got the Burgermeister to hand over the entirety of the town guard (all 7 of them) under the promise that our Cleric had posted invisible Spirit Guardians all around the town to protect (he didn't).\n\nSo after that we head over to visit the Abbot of the town, to see what other help (loot) we could get. We were greeted by some chimera-like abominations that would be at home with Shou Tucker from Full Metal Alchemist. He claimed they were a troubled family who he was trying to cure, but had something go wrong. And although he restored the Burgermeister's son to life (actual life), we were still suspicious. Our suspicions were confirmed when we came across a belligerent 7 foot tall flesh golem.\n\nAfter defeating the abomination, we confronted the \"Abbot.\" Upon entering the Abbey, he unveiled his true form, some sort of corrupted Angel. After a tough battle, and a waaay too close brush with-er-super death(?) for me (a ghost). We defeated the Angel.\n\nAfterwards, we went back to the Burgermeister to explain that the town's spiritual protector was actually no such thing. We recommend the town guard accompany us to \"Order 66\" the remaining abominations.\n\n~~Taking advantage of~~ Gratefully accepting the Burgermeister's generosity, he was convinced to take a permanent sabbatical with his newly resurrected son, handing over control of the town guard to our Fighter, control of the local church to our Tiefling and control over the town itself to our Tabaxi Ranger, with me as his chief adviser.\n\nThen began over an hour of planning, renovating the largely decrepit city, preparing for the possibility of Strahd sieging the city, instituting a system for conscription, a tax per household, a religious tax, as well as a monetary incentive for households to have children to make the population grow, as well as plans to absorb Valaki and eventually the village of Barovia itself.\n\nAlso, unbeknownst to the rest of the ruling party except for the Aarakocra and the Tiefling (both of them serve a bird deity), I sent word to the Marikov family to operate as my secret police.\n\nThe next session is now going to be, most likely, heavily consisting of city administration.\n\nMore to follow.",

        "text": "TL:DR- The dm made homebrew rules that made my technomancer unless. I would compare her to a modern cellphone but a modern cellphone would slaughter this technomancer, hell a HOME PHONE is more capable then that character. So I'd like to see thoughts other gm's would have on how they would handle and players if it is something reasonable. \n\nMy friend brought me into a game with a new group and I only knew her. I was led to believe we were playing Shadowrun with some homebrew rules. I heard they didn't have a technomancer or a decker so I decided to take up the role.\n\nAfter getting there I learned the homebrew rules was that they were using D&amp;D 3.5 mechanics. Meaning a technomancer was going to be a druid but computers instead of animals and machines instead of nature. \n\nIt seemed more confusing then just playing a technomancer normally but I was up for the challenge. Well it got worst.\n\nSo I try to do some typical level 1 technomancer stuff and he stops me right off the bat and says \"You need a device to interface with computers\"......and I'm like \"That's a decker, a technomancers mind is connected\" and he shook his head and said \"not at level 1, at level 10 you'll get something to allow you to connect without a device.\" I didn't argue and just accepted it. However I didn't have any devices and couldn't afford any devices at our level so I was stuck using a device the other hacker in our group used.\n\nWhich, the device was like a cybernetic glove so in order to use any of my powers I had to borrow this guy and essentially 'backseat drive' my own abilities through him. Which meant we both had to roll and the DM was using the lowest of the two rolls. He also loved to give me disadvantage which meant both me and the other player had to roll 2 dice and take the lowest of the 4 dice. \n\nAfter about the 2nd game of this, the other player got annoyed by having to roll on my turns and decided to charge my character a fee. Which meant I either had to not do anything in the group besides combat which I wasn't built for and save up to buy my own device or spend what little money I had to be shit at using his and unable to buy my own equipment. \n\nNeedless to say I don't play with this group anymore. And before people ask, no other player had anything like this happening to them. Hell the ranger was somehow able to tame Chimera, and the Rouge was the more official hacker of the group since he didn't have disadvantage on all of his checks.  ",

        "text": "This is the first session in MnM 3e I've run in a very long time. I love the system, but I have had many other projects come in the foreground, notably a Zelda DnD game that has been going on for some time. I did, however, want to have an excuse to test some recording software in the hopes of podcasting another game. The audio I got isn't really suitable for publication due to connection issues (it was played over Discord) but I had a ton of fun with this one, so I thought I might write it up here.\n\t\nThis would be the first in, hopefully a series of sessions regarding Bravo Academy, a school for people with super powers. This session introduced two players into the scenario.\n\n**The Setting**\n\nThe current year is 2020, and the game takes place in Neo Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nSupers, or Novahumans, have been public knowledge since WW2, when the Slipstream Suffragette made her debut fighting alongside the British Army. Since then, many other novahumans have become known, and generations of heroes and villains have duked it out over the years. We currently sit in the 'New Age of Superheroes', likely to be renamed when it had been determined that it had come to an end. This takes place after the brutal and morally questionable Iron Age of the late 80s and 90s.\n\nIn 2009, the world's greatest supervillain Silas Creed enacted a smaller version of his ultimate plan in Toronto, and it required the most valiant heroes and sympathetic villains to stop. While he was stopped, it ultimately flattened the city itself, killing many and harming many more. With the help of the heroes, Toronto was rebuilt and now stands as Neo Toronto, the most technologically advanced city known to man.\n\nIn addition to this, in an effort not to let the next generation fall into the path of villainy, as well as give the new generation a chance to control their power, the Bravo Academy was established on a man-made island in Lake Ontario, just a little ways off the shore. The school, while not intending to be a 'Superhero Academy', provides superhero-like training, as this was deemed the best method on hand, and this aspect functions more as a supplement to the standard high school experience.\n\n**The Characters**\n\n*Alistair Jacobson* - Alistair comes from the midlands of the UK, transferred to Bravo Academy by his parents. Alistair is a stand-offish sort, and a very combat-focused individual, which caused him to be held back a year previously. He has the power to manipulate wind and air-pressure, allowing for the use of focused air blasts and leaping.\n\n*Makayla Talbot* - Kayla is a very intelligent individual, also being quiet and introverted. Due to her power of being constantly connected to the internet, as well as other technopathy powers, she was able to skip a year (her Google-fu is strong). However, because of this constant connection, she needs to listen to music constantly to avoid zoning out and getting lost in cyberspace.\n\n**The Game**\n\nPlay begins at the Neo Toronto docks. It's the first day of school and the new students are on their way to get to the boat that takes them over to the island. The school provided the students with a holographic device called an 'Anonymiser', one that disguises the appearance of a person with a generic one, at least until a suitable disguise is found for the student. It's not mandatory, but advised.\n\nYou see, the ferry was designed to be discrete and secretive, as picking up students individually with something like the Rook Jets would be far too conspicuous and alarming. However, the ferry over was soon discovered, and media attention became a thing, as well as marketing. At the start of this year, a warm August 29th morning, the area around the ferry was an amalgamation of stalls selling branded materials and equipment for hopeful students. One of these companies providing this was Invoked Inc., with CEO Graham MacMillan networking and selling while his stalls contained Superhero Wares with the Invoked Inc. brand. Around the entrance to the ferry, a throng of media personalities spent their time trying to get questions from students as if it were the red carpet.\n\nKayla spent most of her time finding a spot to avoid the large crowds from. She spent a lot of time examining the Anonymiser, as well as spying two individuals in sharp suits, looking very much like government spooks. Hacking into their comm traffic with her mind, she over heard radio chatter talking about Agent Ebon and Agent Halo, the latter of whom apparently worked at the school.\n\nAlistair, meanwhile, trudged through the crowds and picked up his school supplies from the stalls. While doing so, he encountered a large individual who resembled a Sasquatch currently trying to hide his fuzzy 10ft self behind a stall to avoid the throng of media personalities. Introducing himself, Alistair found that the person was a student, and was unable to talk, communicating with flashcards, one saying \"My name is Pierre D'eau\", apparently being from France. While wandering around, Alistair also spied another potential student buying up as much of the Invoked Inc. stuff as he could carry before staggering over to the ferry.\n\nAlistair made his way over to the ferry, ignoring persistent journalists wanting a scoop, with Pierre fast-walking soon after and Kayla using Pierre as opportunistic cover to slip in unnoticed. With the players onboard, it was soon that the ferry departed, Alistair flipping the media the double-deuces as the boat left.\n\nOut of sight from the media, the new students on board who were still using their anonymisers one-by-one turned them off and commenced either chatting with each other and socialising or keeping to themselves. Both Alistair and Kayla sat calmly by themselves and it continued like this until the door at the front of the passenger hall opened up and in wandered a staff member.\n\nThe woman, being very tall, muscular and imposing, had grey-ish blue skin and platinum silver hair. Using her access to google, Kayla recognised this as 'Golden Conquerer', a Silver-age supervillain and a veritable powerhouse who went missing sometime in the late 70s. Kayla surmises that she might have been among the villains that helped fight against Creed, and may have kept with being a good guy. Other students who recognised her sank in their seats while others looked on.\n\nGC introduced herself as such, and informed the students, much to their dismay, that she was their gym teacher, and for now was on the ferry to ensure everything went well, including the students introducing themselves. With this in mind, she explained that she was going to sort the students into groups, and they were to talk to each other and socialise until the ferry got to the school. Coincidentally enough, Alistair and Kayla were put in a group with Pierre, as well as Jose Almaz from Rio De Janeiro, the kid from earlier buying all the branded stuff.\n\nThe four of them introduce themselves and discuss what the school might have been like, with the subject of their powers quickly coming up. While Pierre's was self-explanatory, Jose demonstrated his ability to summon a tiger-like spirit that seemed to be made of lightning.\n\nThe ferry arrived at the school, a massive man-made island spanning about half a mile across, with very modern buildings. Students and faculty of all kinds zip and fly around it while the new students looked on, and the ferry pulled into a dock set in the side of the island. Disembarking, the group were lead through some hallways and out onto the island. Around them is your standard, positive establishing shot; pleasant weather, teens going from place to place, happily chatting and hanging out. \nProgressing on, the group at lead to the auditorium, in which they are introduced to the earlier mentioned Agent Halo. Halo is in a similar suit, though the jacket is open and the tie removed. Halo seems to have a Mohawk, likely a necessity considering his lower jaw and neck were mainly metallic.\n\nHalo reiterates what the students know in their pamphlets: while the school is run primarily by superheroes, and the training programs are superhero orientated, there was no inclination to becoming a hero. The school would run normal classes in a normal period, then there are tutoring sessions outside of traditional school hours to hone their powers. Superheroing isn’t recommended, but there’s little anyone can do to stop them.\n\nWhen asking for questions, the only one that comes up is from Alistair who asks what Halo’s powers were, which Halo explains that the cybernetics on his chest, neck and lower parts of his face allow him to create powerful and harmful noise in the forms of screams. No one else has any questions, being as kids are and wanting the assembly to simply be over.\n\nAfter questions are done, Halo explains that there will be a test, one that isn’t on their pamphlets. While all the students had been accepted into the school, they wanted a collective demonstration of what the students are able to do given certain situations. As such, they will be taking part in a mock hostage situation in the Abandonned Warehouses District of Toronto Docks (yes, it is actually called that). One other student, a long haired bespectacled girl, questions this and whether it’s a good idea. Halo responds by saying that this is the kind of superhero style training mentioned, though admits no specifics were given. The students didn’t need to worry about anything endangering them, as all the training was painstakingly designed to be non-lethal.\n\nThe group are lead to a changing room, one that contained many different changing cubicles and facilities. In each cubical was the school’s standard PE gear and generic student superhero costumes, which were these black and white jumpsuit and jacket affairs with full face masks, the facemasks themselves having inbuilt communicators. These were promptly ‘adapted’ but all who had their costumes in mind already, with Alistair adding his MMA gloves, scarf and goggles, and Kayla adding her headphones. Pierre finally gets clothes that fit him properly.\n \nThe students are then lead down more hallways to the hangars where they keep a small fleet of jets, large automated vehicles called Rooks that are very reminiscent of a Lockheed Blackbird. Halo is there, putting people into groups ready for the exercise, and sure enough, Alistair and Kayla are paired up.\n\nThe Rook jet takes our protagonists over to a section of the district. You see, since the city was flattened by a super villain attack, people became all the more aware of collateral damage. As such, a section of the city was designed to be a series of perpetually abandoned buildings, thus local heroes to take their battles somewhere outside of the city, but not so far as to provide too great a risk to others or run the risk of their quarry getting bored. That, and a series of unoccupied buildings make the local criminal element think it’s a good place to hide, and thus it becomes the first place authorities will go. Finally, the district makes good training spots for students as it becomes a safe simulation for them to train their powers in an effort to reduce collateral damage.\n \nThe Rook hovers above the designated drop-off and Alistair jumps out while kayla uses her electro powers to hitch a ride on the nearby powerline and safely get to the ground. As they settle in, halo comes in on their earpieces and reminds them of their task: they have to find the location of the hostage situation and do their best to neutralise it.\n \nKayla looks around, before slipping into cyberspace and finding a series of security cameras. Hacking into the network, she finds a collection of cameras that show a bunch of robots, all with pink chasis and metallic popped collars. The Dudebots, of which there were fourteen had occupied an office-type building, with the tags on the camera suggesting five of them were holding the hostage (represented by an obvious mannequin) on the top floor. Using the leaping aspect of his powers, Alistair hopped into the air and scouted around. He saw the other students going about their tests, even managing to spy Jose running with his tiger along a roof top, only to stop at the edge as if remembering he couldn’t jump it. In the midst of all this, Alistair spots Dudebots to the south and upon landing, lets Kayla know about the situation.\n \nThe two make their way, Kayla teleporting via the powerlines again and sneaking into an alleyway near the building in question. Alistair leaps his way there, only to have his travel interrupted by a bolt of energy narrowly missing him. Looking for the source, he spots a pair of turrets on nearby buildings and endeavours to, on his next jump, fire back, only for the distance to impede his air blast and the turret to withstand the blow.\n \nMeanwhile, Kayla spies a pair of dudebots guarding the entrance to the building, and using her technopathy takes control of one, forcing it to shoot the other. The Dudebots being minions, it fails its toughness save and collapses to the ground in a heap of metal. Alistair, now much closer to his target, uses a full force Air Cannon and destroys the turret, propelling it from the roof and onto Kayla’s unlucky Dudebot. Before celebrations can be made, Alistair gets nailed by the other turret while moving into cover, taking a bruise.\n \nWith the commotion outside, a large number of the Dudebots inside make their way out. As Kayla’s ability to control them is perception range, and is still watching them on the camera, she hijacks another bot and repeats her efforts, taking out another hapless robot before the others realise what’s up and gundown the turncoat. Alistair hops out of his cover and fires another air cannon shot straight down, destroying the turret and a good portion of the building in question, making his acrobatics check to land safely.\n \nKayla resumes hacking, though her next hack misses its mark and the new turncoat is taken out before being able to do anything. The dudebots on their way down the steps make a stop at the second floor and set up by the windows. Kayla keeps an eye on the remaining bots on the top floor, and Alistair launches himself through a window on the second floor, catching a dudebot bolt to the shoulder as he comes in, but taking out one all the same. The hit he took gives him a bruise but also dazes him, and he scrambles to hide and recover while chaos breaks loose. Using her electro static grip, Kayla clings to the side of the building and begins to climb towards the top floor.\n \nWhen the Dudebots find Alistair, he feigns surrender, distracting the robots long enough for him to use extra effort and turn his Air Cannon into a cone, annihilating the robots, and the wall behind them, flinging them onto the street. Now fatigued, Alistair makes his way up the floors to the top one, waiting for Kayla before using the multi attack feature of his Air Snipe attack to attack each of the remaining four dudebots, busting two of them. Kayla then controls one and attempts to attack another, only to miss (the Dudebots aren’t the most accurate in the world.) As Kayla sneaks in and the final Dudebot makes his final proclamation, it stops in the middle of it, and in a rather out of character fashion, wanders over to the window and looks out.\n \nCurious, Alistair moves over to the window to see what the Dudebot appears to be staring at. Outside, about 200 feet down the road is a figure dressed in black. It appears the person, slender in form is wearing a long black coat with a tri-corner hat. After a brief moment she declares “Stand and deliver!”.\n \nA brief Google-fu session reveals to Kayla that this is legit supervillain ‘Iron Bandit’. Alistair attempts to hit her with an air snipe, only for the Iron Bandit to roll her shoulder out the way and in the same movement draw a pistol and fire, obliterating the head of the Dudebot next to him. The pistol itself doesn’t make a bang of any kind, instead being rather silent.\n \nSuitably alarmed, Kayla immediately gets on to Agent Halo and informs him of the supervillain in their midst. On the other end, Halo says they’ll be there ASAP, and that the two of them should focus on their survival. Alistair decides to ignore the last part, and leaps out to confront the villain who had decided to take cover by a nearby car; after all, he can’t let someone like this threaten the other students.\n \nAlistair launches another attack, sadly missing and Iron Bandit retaliates by drawing a second pistol and unloading at Alistair as she walks to different cover. Alistair takes a bullet to the shoulder, and it’s theorised the weapons Iron Bandit carries are railguns. With a damaged shoulder, Alistair’s follow up attempt with the Air Cannon goes wide and wipes out a nearby wall. Kayla looks over the situation while ordering her still dominated Dudebot to take the ‘hostage’ somewhere safe (she was going to pass this test with flying colours, supervillain or no). Looking out the window, Kayla’s player makes a point that it’s 2020, in the most technologically advanced city on the planet, spending a hero point to edit the scene to make the car Iron Bandit is hiding behind autonomous, before promptly hacking it. The villain is taken by surprise as her cover revs to life and immediately runs her over, causing her to suffer a bruise and become staggered.\n \nSeeing his opportunity, now with no cover hindering him, Alistair uses his Air Launcher melee attack to forcefully send Iron bandit skywards. As she falls, Kayla preps the car to act as a landing pad, but the falling villain is soon swept up in a golden blur of movement, their new gym teacher sailing overhead and catching the dazed Iron Bandit. Shortly after, a Rook jet arrives with Halo standing in the open doorway, arms crossed.\n \nThat’s where our session ended. Truthfully, I’ve never had a session of MnM go so well. Most times the nature of the game had lead encounters to swing heavily in favour of one combatant or the other, and I was quite pleased that such an encounter went so well. [Hopefully, sessions to follow will go similarly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7zhkld/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_2/)",

        "text": "(Note: I'm new to reddit. Is there an acceptable way to post one entry in two different subreddits? If posting the same content in multiple places is considered rude, I don't wanna be that guy).\n\nI'm fortunate enough to GM a game of FFG SW for a very invested and very active group. We meet every weekend for a 4-6 hour session, and most weeks some players may ask me to meet a second day as well to participate in 'sidequest' missions - smaller adventure opportunities for players to accomplish minor goals.\n\nTheir most recent adventure brought them to the surface of a planet where their presence was largely unwanted by the locals. After an extensive effort made by the players to rally the local militias however, the players were able to strike their first major blow against the Imperial occupation.\n\nEverything was looking pretty good between the players and the locals now. The militia was organized, the players had convinced them to accept the aid of the Rebel Alliance, and the players were going to receive compensation from those same rebels for their efforts. They had another lead they had intended to follow on this planet and for all intents and purposes their work was done here. The rebels would take care of the rest.\n\nNow this particular planet was the homeworld of one of the players, so they actually decided to stick around and do more to help out once Rebel forces arrived (despite not being rebels themselves). Leading up to one of those 'sidequest' days I mentioned, the players told me they wanted to raid the Imperial supply depot that they had spotted in the mountain range while flying nearby some days earlier. It was made clear by both the locals and the rebels that there weren't enough weapons or medical supplies to go around and the players wanted to lend their support.\n\nSo come sidequest day, the General in charge of liberating this world assigned the players to form a strike team and to sneak into a hidden mountain supply depot to capture a certain number of supplies to outfit the local militia. The assignment was to locate weapon containers as well as containers filled with medical supplies, and then to commandeer a vehicle from the Imperial hangar to pilot back to the rebel hideout while a drawn out battle in the nearby canyons drew the main forces away from the supply depot. They were assigned three groups of minions (4 minions per group, 12 minions total) - members of the local militia - each with a special set of skills. The players could assign these minions to complete tasks, arrange them into squads, and generally make use of them in any way they saw fit. The players were generally excited by this and even went through the trouble of naming their NPC minions. In the battles that followed, the players would even opt to take hits in place of their minions to get them through the mission safely.\n\nPartway through the mission however, upon reaching the warehouse of assorted cargo containers (weapons and medical supplies), things took a weird turn. The militia members that had been following their orders so far became curt and unresponsive. Issuing orders to the militia members was no longer an easy Leadership check - players were now required to roll against their discipline to get them to comply to any orders. The militia members addressed each other directly to give each other orders and no longer acknowledged the players. After disappearing among the cargo containers for a few minutes, the militia members gathered in the warehouse and began fiddling with one of the cargo transports, hotwiring the vehicle and getting ready to take off. And the players? Well...\n\nBefore I continue my story, I should take a moment to point out that I have incredible players who I'm very proud of. They're proactive and creative. They follow leads, take chances, and allow themselves to make suboptimal choices if they find those decisions more interesting for their characters. So believe me when I tell you that I never could've anticipated what they did next. Once they reached the warehouse and the militia members started acting all dicey, they did... nothing.\n\nThe players made a point of standing around while the militia members disappeared into the stacks of cargo containers. They were annoyed that the militia members were acting oddly toward them all of a sudden, but chalked this up to the locals' initial resistance to accepting help from off-worlders and decided not to press the issue. One player - a vehicle-savvy bounty hunter - waited indifferently inside one of the cargo transports for the militia members to start loading containers so they could be on their way (this wasn't the player being rude - rather it's in his character's nature). The other one was listening in on the comms and keeping an eye out for Imperials. Two more stood patiently by and watched the militia members kill time and make excuses about why they're not loading cargo containers, and eventually just watched them all load up into a transport. And eventually just... watched them drive off. The militia members had wandered off into the supply stacks for a few minutes, made excuses, twiddled their thumbs, hotwired a vehicle and just drove off... leaving the players there. And the players just watched them. Just watched them drive off. I was stunned by their inaction.\n\n\"They must've panicked and decided to bail\", offered the bounty hunter. \"What? No! Enough of this shit!\", yelled the archaeologist, frustrated. She heads over to the supply depot command center (they had successfully broken in using the command codes found in an Imperial officer's belongings), and got the stolen transport on the comms, demanding an explanation. And - after nailing that crucial Leadership check demanding an explanation - that's when the truth came out...\n\n\"Not everyone in the militia agrees with working with offworlders! We want you, the rebels, and the Empire off the planet! Our real mission was to plant seismic charges at crucial points in the warehouse, taking out the supply depot and the nearby forces battling in the mountain range! That place is gonna blow in 20 minutes!\"\n\nAnd the look on my players' faces when they realized they'd been betrayed by their minions... NPCs who they even took the time to name and to protect... I'll never forget that moment. I saw their hearts break in front of me, and my heart broke too. They trusted their little NPC minion buddies completely. They were devastated. I felt like I had betrayed them, and it took them a moment to collect themselves and figure out what to do next.\n\nThey contacted the commander leading the attack force and updated him on the unexpected developments. The situation was clear. They had ten minutes to hotwire that second transport, the one the bounty hunter was sitting in, load up as much cargo as possible, and escape the mountains with enough time to clear the blast radius of the seismic charges. And then the players ran into a second issue. They had no idea what were in any of the cargo containers.\n\nHaving run out of time, the strongest of the lot, a Nautolan with cybernetic enhancements, took to loading up the transport himself. The archaeologist got lucky with her Computers skills and was able to program some load lifter droids to help out. The young sage also got lucky with her Mechanics check to get the transport moving. Everyone was nailing these critical challenges once a fire was lit under their asses and they realized they had to get moving. Having done everything they could, the bounty hunter piloted their asses out of there, maintaining cover in a narrow mountain pass, successfully hiding from a nearby patrol of TIE bombers that was circling the battleground. It was tight, but they narrowly escaped with their lives.\n\nThey salvaged what they could, and since they had no idea what they grabbed, we rolled for the contents of the containers they were able to bring back to the rebel hideout. It turns out they were actually very close to completing their mission, recovering all of the weapons they needed to arm the militia and about half of the medical supplies. Once they were in the clear, they reported to the rebel general and to the militia leader the presence of potential traitors inside the militia. And then we (the players and myself) had a fun little chat.\n\nMy players don't fail very often, so this was an interesting experience for them that we all wanted to talk about. I mostly wanted to talk to them too to make sure there were no hard feelings and because (after seeing their hearts break) I was worried that they were no longer having fun. The players really did trust the NPCs wholeheartedly. They did take for granted though that once they delivered the NPCs to the warehouse that the NPCs would do the rest of the work, which I found absolutely baffling because it was at no point implied that the NPCs would finish the job for them.\n\nAfterward we discussed all the clues about their behaviour, which we all laughed about in hindsight because the clues were numerous and I kept slowing their plans and acting more blatantly so I could give the players a chance to respond. We also discussed all the things the players could have done in that scenario - what they wished they'd done in hindsight and what I thought they might do. Things like loading up the cargo containers themselves alongside the militia members, which would've made it harder for the NPCs to sneak away, demanding their compliance, identifying cargo containers using the inventory or shipping logs at the command center, using a cargo scanner, etc...\n\nAfter everything was said and done they were just full of ideas and we all had a good laugh about how silly it was that they just stood around and watched the NPCs betray them slowly... and I was relieved to see that nobody was upset to the point where they stopped having fun.\n\nEven though betraying my players with those NPCs ranks among my worst memories as a GM (I didn't expect to feel as guilty as I did), the lessons they learned were priceless and they're all glad they were able to participate in that mission. It also lead directly into what might be one of the best adventures we ever had, when my players told me that they wanted to go looking for the traitors themselves so they could deal with them personally...\n\nBut that's a story for another time...!\n",

        "text": "I read and enjoyed a few of the solo RP sessions written by /u/bionicle_fanatic and was intrigued by his description of how the system works - and last night, our DM had to bail on us due to a surprise visit from a family member.  It was a prime opportunity to have a quick one-shot with one of the side NPCs that the party ran into trouble with previously: Tabor Tailbane, half-orc paladin of Pharasma, Lady of Graves.\n\nIn our previous session, Tabor hired some muscle to capture the party's Spiritualist and his phantom, assuming that he trapped an unwilling phantom and was preventing it from moving on to the afterlife.  My party was oblivious to motives though, and assumed that it was just a kidnapping.  This resulted in Tabor getting stabbed in the back repeatedly by the party rogue (who got a surprise round AND rolled a nat 20 on initiative) disguised as the unconscious Spiritualist, followed by Tabor bleeding out once combat was over despite our best efforts to stabilize him.\n\nWe cheaped out on bringing him back to life though, and only paid for a Reincarnate instead of a Raise Dead.  The dice were happy to oblige with our peevishness and decided that Tabor, Paladin of Pharasma deserved to be a Goblin.  He was understandably upset with this state of affairs, but couldn't just outright attack us because, well, *paladin* - and we did technically help him.  Plus he couldn't actually wield his greataxe any more.\n\nThis is where yesterday's session began, and where the GM Emulator Engine (at RPGSolo.com) came into play.  Only the notable rolls are mentioned below; there were many more that were just part of the flow.\n\nTabor was not happy with being a Goblin.  He really, really wanted to be a half-orc again, and so we rolled up a couple of Tabor's cousins - Argog Tailbane, a sorcerer, and Blarta Tailbane, a rogue.  Tabor decided to hit them up to see if they could help him out of his current predicament, and so went looking for them.  He didn't actually know where they lived, but he knew where his carousing cousin Rian Tailbane lived, and she was likely to know where pretty much *anyone* in the family lived.  Turned out, not only did she know where they lived, she knew where they were likely to be.  Blarta was trying to sleep off a hangover after too much drinking the night before, and although Argog was out practicing his spellcasting with his mentor, Megumin (lifted blatantly from KonoSuba), he and Rian were supposed to have lunch a little later on at a pub called the Roasted Boar.\n\nAfter hammering on Blarta's door (who laughed in Tabor's face upon seeing that he was a goblin), they met up with Argog at the Boar and asked if he might have any idea what they could do to fix Tabor's height problem.  Argog knew that it would take a *wish* or *miracle* to properly restore Tabor... but it turned out that Megumin had heard of a rumor.  (Unlikely chance: Yes, And...  Prompt: Ordinary / Orphanage)\n\nThe local orphanage, it was said, was built atop an old sunken wizard's tower, with a fountain that had magical properties.  Injured, sick, or weak infants could be bathed in its waters, and receive a new body - a new chance at life, free from their former afflictions.  Only those less than a year old could benefit from its properties... but of course, Tabor's new body had only been around for a day so far.  It was possible the waters would work on him.  There was a problem though - a part of the ruins collapsed, and immediately afterwards, horrible monsters poured into them, endangering anyone who entered.  The entrance was sealed, and the secret fountain more-or-less forgotten completely.  For years, the orphanage had been operating normally, and the new matron was likely completely oblivious to what lay beneath it.\n\nThe Tailbane trio, of course, thought that sounded promising, and so thanked Megumin and Rian and made their way to the Orphanage.  The matron, seeing two half-orcs and a goblin at her front door, bristling with weapons, squawked in fear and slammed the door in their faces.  Eventually she was convinced that they weren't there to kidnap children or rob her and negotiations began.  The Tailbanes agreed to donate 25% of any loot they found to the orphanage in exchange for being permitted into the basement... provided they re-sealed the bricked-over entrance to the dungeon when they were done.\n\nAt this point, I pulled up Donjon's Dungeon Generator.  I asked the DM if there was more than one floor to the dungeon - no.  Was the entrance to the dungeon a set of stairs leading into it?  Yes.  The three of us unilaterally decided the dungeon was aberration-themed, and we had a battle mat handy to draw it out on.  We'd just have to pretend our heroes didn't know the layout, and none of us would look at any of the dungeon's details until they became pertinent.  It wound up being a somewhat labyrinthine, 16-room affair.  In a stroke of luck, someone had scrawled a simple map on the wall of a corridor branching off of the first room we went into.  It didn't show the location of the fountain, unfortunately.\n\nOur first hurdle was something that would be a plague to us throughout the dungeon: a stuck door.  We were pitiful un-optimized 2nd-level characters, so strength checks to kick the door down were more likely to sprain an ankle than succeed... but we *did* have three greataxes (one small-sized for Tabor), so we were still able to chop through the wooden doors, but their hardness of 5 made it a tedious affair - and there was no way anything on the other side of the door wouldn't hear us coming, making Blarta's stealth checks pretty much useless.  A *lot* of the doors were stuck, likely due to the place being abandoned for years.\n\nOur second hurdle was a javelin trap on the following door that immediately took Argog down to zero HP.  We decided we should probably stock up on some healing potions before getting any further and scrambled back up the stairs.\n\nShortly after returning with renewed HP and a few more potions, we ran into an Adamantine Cobra, coiled in the center of a room and looking hostile.  We quickly discovered that Shocking Grasp worked amazingly against it, but Blarta suffered a nasty bite that caused him to lose a point of Constitution from the poison still in its reservoir which, although it had lost some potency, was still annoying.  Tabor used a Heal check on Blarta to beat the saving throw before it had a chance to knock Blarta's hit points down any further.  On the plus side, we were able to pry the adamantine plates off of it and sell them as scrap for a tidy 450 gold.  (Adamantine is good stuff.)\n\nWe ran into a lone Choker, which turned out to be fairly simple to deal with, since Blarta's decent CMB could turn the grapple in his favor, letting him pin the aberration and let someone else just chop off its head.  It still got in a good hit though, and we decided that we should rest and come back in the morning, with health and Argog's spells restored.\n\nThere was a hiccup the following morning, though.  The streets around the orphanage were completely blocked off for a funeral procession going through the city.  The city guard wasn't likely to let a bunch of armed greenskins run around through it, so we had to come up with a plan.  Fortunately, we had a tool at our disposal:  A potion of disguise.\n\nArgog chugged the potion, disguising himself as a guard.  Tabor hid in a crate, which Argog and Blarta carried to the orphanage (no one was likely to stop someone helping a guard carry a big box).  The plan worked flawlessly - until Argog saw Megumin walking along the tail end of the procession.  A quick conversation later revealed that Megumin was planning on lighting the funeral pyre.\n\nThis was a bad idea.\n\nMegumin had convinced the organizers of the funeral that she was a powerful magician.  This wasn't strictly false, but the problem was that Megumin was only actually capable of casting a single spell - the equivalent of a maximized, widened fireball.  If she lit the funeral pyre, instead of a somber fire, there would hardly be anything left but flying debris.\n\nWhile Argog and Tabor hid in the orphanage, Blarta stealthed it up and followed Megumin.  He rolled ridiculously well on his sneak, and managed to clock Megumin with a sap for nearly maximum damage while no-one was looking and drag her off into an alleyway, and then into the orphanage.\n\nThe party convinced the matron that Megumin had passed out and needed to rest - and that she should stay lying down even if she insisted she was fine.  We figured *someone* in the funeral procession would be able to light the pyre without too much trouble when Megumin turned up missing.  With that minor emergency dealt with, they headed back into the dungeon.\n\nThe crawl went fairly normally.  Another choker was dealt with even more quickly than the first.  A couple more traps were avoided with the judicious use of a quarterstaff to poke doors open.  A trio of stirges - housecat-sized, bat-winged, horrible mosquitos - were more trouble, draining entirely too many points of Constitution before getting splatted against the walls.  Fortunately, no one contracted any diseases from them.  The oddest encounter was a room with several rusty iron cages.  We asked the DM a question:  Was there anything in the cages?  \"Yes, and...\"  We decided one of the wandering monsters was trapped in it, and rolled on the list to see which it was: a diseased, maddened vargouille, froth dripping from its horrid mouth.  The only reason it had survived this long was because it was undead.  We put it out of its misery.\n\nAfter a few rooms, we began rolling to see if the next room had the fountain in it, starting at a 5% chance and going up by 5% for each room explored.  We soon ran into a problem:  There were two doors we couldn't get past, completely blocking off the rest of the dungeon.  One was a rusted iron door.  The other was a locked stone door.  We weren't about to ruin our axes trying to break either one, but we hadn't found a key.  We asked the DM:  Is the key inside the dungeon?  \"No, but...\"  Disheartened, we exited the dungeon and spoke to the orphanage matron.  As luck would have it, the DM decided SHE had the key - she had no clue what it went to, but it looked fancy enough that she had kept it.  Even better, the fountain was in the very next room.  We had found our objective!\n\nTabor stripped off his armor, and waded into the small pool formed by the fountaining water.\n\nWe didn't want Tabor's journey to end here, so we asked the DM with a Very Unlikely chance: Does the fountain still work?\n\n\"No, and...\"  It was corrupted.  It didn't Reincarnate the subject.  So what effect did it have?  A random effect, we decided.  So we started rolling for what spell effect it had.\n\nClass:  Wizard.\n\nWe asked the DM: Is it a 1-3 level spell?  \"Yes, and...\"  Holy cow, it had more than one effect.  (Mind you, the \"and..\" and \"but..\" suffixes were somewhat rare.  This was totally unexpected.)\n\nSo we rolled for the second spell.  Class: Druid.  Level 1-3?  No.  4-5?  Yes.  Flipped a coin, fifth level spell.  Rolled for the spell itself...\n\nEnlarge Animal.\n\nHe was enlarged permanently, into a Medium-sized goblin.  His strength was ridiculous thanks to the spell effect and he could use his old greataxe and plate mail again, but *he was still a goblin*.  We took a few minutes to recompose ourselves after laughing so hard we couldn't breathe.\n\nThe other spell effect turned out to be a permanent Ghost Sound - which of course, we decided was in the form of spooky ghost sounds.  At which point the DM surprised us again with a random event - a new NPC.  One who, according to the prompt, was imprisoned.  The ghost sounds weren't just ghost sounds - there was an actual ghost haunting Tabor now, who was trapped and wanted to be freed.  They were held back by an object of some kind - what that object was, the ghost didn't know.  It likely had something to do with the fountain, but the details were unclear.  Tabor felt duty-bound as a paladin of Pharasma to see the spirit laid to rest... and that's where we left off, with poor Tabor the oversized goblin unable to get a good night's sleep among the sounds of ghostly moaning, rattling chains, and creaking wood.\n\nWe decided we liked our new randomized DM.",

        "text": "     Earlier today I played in my first D&amp;D experience. I'd dabbled in character creation before, enamored by the statistics and what they entailed, but I'd never actually played before. \n\n\nSo today we began our adventure together as a group of adventurers, in our case pretty much fanciful mercenaries, hired to guard a caravan of unknown goods for someone who seems to be a merchant. We travel along the main road from the port city, meet some of our fellow adventurers for hire, PCs and NPCs. The day passes with little of import occurring. \n\n\nDuring the night, however, a fully armed and armored cavalry unit is identified by the arcane familiar of one of our party members. They're racing towards us, hard. The rest of the caravan is awakened and we prepare for whatever comes for us. During the preparations it comes out that the cargo we've been guarding are weapons that have been stolen from a nearby Lord who also happens to be a shady weapons dealer. \n\n\nAs we decide whether to fight, or flee and give up the one who hired us, but we run out of time discussing and the armored cavalry are nearly upon us. One of our party members readies his javelin, one fires a magic bolt and another looses an arrow. There's no going back now. I am a bladesinger wizard at level 3, but I rolled for HP during character creation and of course I rolled a 1 and 2, so I decide to maintain a safe distance, casting minor illusion next to one of the wagons in the shape of a box and hide myself within it so that I may safely observe the situation before taking rash action.\n\n\nI prepare to cast hold person on one of the charging cavalry hoping to have him fall and be trampled underneath the hooves of one of his allies, when suddenly 3 great bursts of flame crash down on my allies, wiping out nearly half of them, including one of my fellow PCs. I realize we are woefully outmatched and decide to not do anything that would cause harm to our assailants in hope that upon being discovered I could perhaps plea some forgiveness or good will. From then on I use my dancing lights to blind the assailants who were attacking my allies that weren't actively trying to murder the cavalry(again, I wanted every excuse when I later encountered them). With this my allies were able to survive about 3 times as long, but they all eventually succumbed to the overwhelming opponents.\n\n\nI hid in my box, barely not being discovered by a soldier examining the wagon. After some time had passed, I recast minor illusion in the form of ropes binding my arms and approached one of the soldiers. I attempted to convince him that when I discovered what was being transported I tried to leave and that they captured me, and it was all going smoothly despite my -2 charisma. As I was discussing with the guard, suddenly he asks \"If thats what happened, then why do you still have your weapons?\" I panicked and unable to come up with a satisfying answer in the moment, I replied that upon seeing the incoming cavalry they didn't have the time to take my weapons... \"I'm going to need you to make another deception check\". In dread I pray to the Lord of luck that I manage to pass... A natural 1. The man checks the bindings. \"Did you think that would fool me?\" He draws his sword. Not wanting to antagonize him further I don't cast shield. The pommel of his sword slams into the side of my head and I too fall unconscious. \n\nSo ended my first dungeons and dragons encounter.",

        "text": "I'm the DM. There are three player characters: a bard, a rogue, and a wizard.\n\nThis story starts with a TPK deep in a dungeon. Fortunately for our band of heroes, the Raven Queen has a use for them, and requires they be not dead. She resurrects the party and appears to them in the dungeon, saying that if they return to the nearby town and 'bring fate to a man who has cheated death' they will be allowed to keep being not dead. She gives the rogue a raven charm to aid in their assignment. The party decides that being not dead is preferable to the alternative and return to town.\n\nI'll give a bit of backstory now. when the players had first come to this town, they met a woman named Adella. She gave them a place to sleep their first night there, and they learned her husband was the town's mayor. He wasn't home that night, so they didn't meet him.\n\nBack to the present. So the party returns to the town and does some unrelated stuff like report back to the person who sent them to the dungeon, put out a house fire, and save some innocent goblins from getting lynched. As you do. While the lynch-crowd disperses, Adella walks by, along with a man the party hasn't seen before. As the rogue lays eyes on the man, the raven charm grows deathly cold. In this same instant, Adella turns to see the party, screams \"No!\", and hurries him away. Realizing this guy's who they're after, the party chases them into a building, where the couple disappears. Some searching and investigating later, the party finds a lot of information, but nothing that fully answers what's going on or where their quarry might be. \n\nHere's that information:\n\n* Adella and the man used magic to teleport away.\n* Adella is a priest to Avandra, the goddess of travel.\n* The man is Adella's husband Ojen, making him the town's mayor.\n* Ojen was once involved in a incident that made Adella fear for his health.\n* There's a nearby pond where Adella likes to spend time.\n\nUsing this, the party ventures to the pond, where they find Adella and Ojen. After some tense discussion, a couple more things are revealed:\n\n* The aforementioned incident was where Ojen had contracted a magical sickness and Adella healed him.\n* When Adella ran earlier that day, is was because she detected the same magic aura from the raven charm that the sickness had given off.\n\nEveryone is confused as it's not the Queen's M.O. to go around killing people, as she's supposed to be a neutral 'ferryman' type of death god. Nonetheless, Ojen accepts his fate. He closes his eyes and drops to his knees. Since Adella still looks like she wants to try and fight, the wizard puts a a sword to her throat (Probably extreme, but they didn't have anyone strong to hold her down.). The rogue notches an arrow and prepares to shoot Ojen in the heart. I should mention the players have a similar attitude as Ojen does right now. I decide to have Adella roll a wisdom save to not do something stupid.\n\nNatural 1.\n\nAdella leaps forward as the arrow is loosed, tearing her throat on the blade. I have her roll acrobatics against the rogue's attack roll, and she fails. The arrow strikes through Ojen's heart as Adella, her throat gushing blood, lands on the ground in front of him. The bard hurries and spends their last spell slot to heal her as Ojen falls over, dead.\n\nWhere his expression was, before, one of grim acceptance, it is now one of pure horror.\n\nAnd the session ends there.",

        "text": "This is an xpost from the /r/subnautica per a suggestion in the comment.  I've edited a bit out to make it more suitable for this subreddit, hope you all enjoy!\n\nTo set the stage, it had been about a month since I had crash landed on this ocean planet.  The communications I had received were either tragic accounts of other survivors, the bleak attempts of a failed rescue, or cryptic messages with dire undertones from an unknown and presumably alien source.  My long term survival strategy has turned from 'waiting for a rescue to find me' to 'facilitating my own rescue'.  My life pod's fabrication unit has served me well by cooking my caught fish and re-purposing debris and scrap metals from the wreckage.  With this fabrication unit, I was able to build a more permanent structure at the shallow bottom of the reef where my solar panels can still pick up the sunlight during the day.  The base of Mazlow's hierarchy was now met, I had a secure supply of air, water, food, sleep, and shelter.  Time to work on the next level of that hierarchy and secure my safety by getting off this planet.   \n\nI had just built my first Seamoth, a one-person submersible, and set out to explore with less trepidation than my previous voyages. With a metal framed and mobile source of oxygen, no Sand Shark nor Stalker would impede me. The vehicle’s speed allowed me venture further as well. I set my sights to the Aurora (the giant crashed space ship that dominates the horizon). I had been close to it before, harvesting resources from the debris of the wreckage and doomed life pods, but one must be conservative with rations, and so my exploration had been limited. These were the worries of a survivor with no bad ass Seamoth!\n\nI quickly mopped up the sea floor and slowly made my way to the stern of the crashed space ship, where the debris became more interesting. Night was setting, but the Seamoth has two powerful flood lights that clicked on to show me new pieces of debris that I can scan to recreate back at base. I parked my Seamoth at a distance to illuminate the debris field and disembarked. Around this time, I noticed eerie sounds. Nothing too alarming, just some unsettling moans coming from something in the deep pitch black that surrounded me in every direction. Ok, I was alarmed. But I steeled myself against the dread that was swelling as I know that I must push forward and find the technologies that will advance my efforts to be rescued. Without an eventual rescue, my safety here and now means nothing. I approached the debris and got to task. I willed my scanner to quicken it’s processing as the sounds did not lessen, but in fact became more ominous. After scanning a few pieces of something called a Cyclops, I decided to hedge my bets and scram. I made a mental note of this location and turned around to see my beautiful safe haven, the Seamoth, shining its brilliant heavenly flood lights over me like a cooing mother’s warm promises of protection.\n\nThen the sound manifested itself. https://imgur.com/a/1Zr3a\n\nIt ripped my Seamother’s throat out right in front of me. I witnessed horror incarnate as a silhouette of a beast shook the vehicle back and forth with a ferocity that I couldn’t fathom. After a few seconds it let go and darted back into the cover of darkness. Sparks were flying from the Seamoth and I could hear alarms from my position of roughly 30 meters away, but it looked as though the vehicle was structurally sound. I weighed my options, reviewing the scenario in my head. The beast attacked the Seamoth and not myself. Was it attracted to the lights? I turned off my light.\n\nI waited and watched for another few seconds to see if the beast had lost interest. There was no further movement or moans, I made up my mind and darted for the Seamoth. 25 meters, 15, 10, 5… The crunch of metal was loud and sudden. The alarms of the vehicle faded with the doppler effect as it was dragged away from me and I was plunged into the darkness as the lights were crushed. Panic gripped me. Was this thing toying with me? Had it baited me back to the ship just to take it away at the last second? Was this the source of that weird, half translated message I received? While paralysis slowly worked itself out of every muscle in my body, my thoughts turned to the immediate need of getting the fuck out of here right the fuck now. I swam towards the stern of the Aurora, hoping to hide in the remains of the highly radioactive thrusters. Cancer, or that beast? No debates, just decisive actions, I summoned my years of experience playing hide and seek to tuck myself away. As dawn approached, the waters lightened. To my dismay, they were murky and tented brown like brackish river water – perfect waters for large predators. I saw the beast now with more details and am still unsure to this day if it was any more or less terrifying as a silhouette. It swam in a patrol roughly 50 meters out from my position. It knows I’m here. Can it sense me somehow? No time for science, it’s survival time. My Seamoth was gone, but I had a real cool Seaglide that had never left my side since it’s creation. I powered up the propellers and plotted a course roughly in the direction of ‘the fuck out of here’. Pops always told me that hesitation would get me killed, so I gunned it.\n\nIt might be worth mentioning that Pops was a taxi driver in Space New York and could always resort to throwing fists with anything that fucked with his vehicle. Maybe I shouldn’t have listened to him, because beastie was on me in a flash and it was not afraid of my fists. I vectored to breach the surface and it was on my heels. We flew out of the water spectacularly in the order of myself, about a liter of my blood, and a monster of a million teeth that had just tasted the fleshy part of my calf. I landed on the engine with a thud and gripped onto a purchase to prevent myself from sliding back into the water. I heard a ‘plop’, the engine shook, and the sound of slick leather on metal told me the beast was falling back in. I had bandages and got to work stopping the blood flowing out of me, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was. While I worked, the Seamoth’s murderer breached several times as it paced and waited for me to enter its domain once more. I waited for a long time after I had last saw the creature before climbing the outside of the wreckage around to the more shallow and familiar waters that I had started my journey on. I made it to my habitat, created Seamoth II, and am preparing for the day I might need to square off with that thing once again.",

        "text": "There were many things in this world that Midnah did not understand. Many a year ago, she had even mused to herself that perhaps their war against the titans had been pointless. Would they be remembered as heroes, or the monsters who slew an entire race? History had a funny way of being sculpted by minds that never experienced it, twisted and modeled into something new.\n\nThe wind pushed aside her hair and a wave rippled through the raven-black locks. She looked up and leapt to the left as a glowing blade pierced the earth where she just stood.\n\n\"Adoniah... you know that you cannot stalk a huntress.\" She turned to face the Dragonborn, the light dancing off of his silvered scales. \"We don't have to continue further than this.\"\n\n\"You are right.\" Adoniah spoke carefully,\"You could turn your people to Bahamut's light. I have foreseen a great darkness spreading from Oleander and Lockhe'Balo. Only knowledge of His truth could alter this fate.\"\n\nMidnah looked down. He asked for too much. \"The freedom of my people to choose their beliefs is not up for negotiation. You likely speak true, but when that darkness comes, we shall be prepared to stop this. You can still stand with us.\" \n    \n\nAdoniah gave a cold hiss to the side. \"I shall not stand with you. We can prevent this darkness in only one way. If you will not allow me to do what I must, you risk needless deaths. I will push you aside.\"\n\nMidnah looked to the sky, reaching slowly back to her quiver. \"You may try.\" \n\nAdoniah spread his shining wings, provided to him by the Platinum Dragon for his loyalty, in the very same moment that Midnah drew her Wanderer's Bow. Adoniah lifted into the sky, twisting and turning swiftly to make himself a harder target for the huntress. She poised herself, took a breath in, and as she exhaled, let loose. \n\nThe arrow struck true once, but her next shot was deftly blocked by Adoniah's Shield of Piety. Adoniah swooped in, raising his Holy Avenger and slashing at Midnah's chest. \n\nA searing pain took hold of Midnah, but she held back her gasps of agony and drew two short swords from her hip. Midnah's attacks barely glanced off of Adoniah's scales, and she knew that a direct fight would lead only to her death. Adoniah knew it too. \n\nMidnah leapt back in an aerial somersault, and as Adoniah attempted to snag her with an attack, she twisted to lessen the impact. She ran into the nearby woods and quickly concealed herself amongst the thick trees. \n\n\"Midnah! Show yourself! Fight and die with honor!\" Adoniah took to the skies again, giving a fierce growl. \n\nMidnah cringed. She'd seen this in action. If he entranced her in a Compelled Duel spell, she couldn't possibly resist. She fired a single arrow and leapt from the tree, hiding in the undergrowth as Adoniah, with a fresh arrow lodged in his shoulder, charged into the trees and searched for her. \n\nMidnah managed to evade detection long enough to make a whispered incantation and move, in the blink of an eye, to another location out of Adoniah's reach. Midnah took up position. She fired two shots before jumping down again and rushing to concealment. \n\n\"Gah... you rotten woman! You cower in the shadows like a rat awaiting demise!\" Adoniah searched for her, enraged.\n\nMidnah looked down, her heart racing as every beat threatened to tear her apart at the seams. She loved Adoniah. She loved Viktor. They were her allies. Her brothers. Her...\n\n\"Complete, utter fools!\" She screamed aloud, firing a shot as she jumped from her perch.\nMidnah rolled on her shoulders and stood, firing a second shot. Both struck true, at a velocity that sundered Adoniah's shining wings and forced him to the ground. He snarled, pointing in her direction. \n\nTheir eyes met. Adoniah meant to speak, but faltered. It was only a moment, a hesitation of less than a second. He winced slightly as he realized his mistake and cast his spell. \n\n\"Face me!\"\n\nMidnah's focus tunneled in on the Dragonborn and she drew her short swords, charging in. Her rage overcame her as she struck, again and again. Who was Adoniah to steal her people's freedom? Who was he to tell them that they could not withstand the darkness without his handholding? \n\nMidnah thrust at his chest, slashed his arm, and reset. Adoniah shoved her back with the pommel of his blade and smacked her with his shield. Midnah was winded by the blows, but attacked with both swords in a crashing downward slash, which was met by the Shield of Piety. The blessed shield gave a soft glow as her weapons fell to the side. \n\nAdoniah took the opportunity and thrust with his shining Holy Avenger, following it up with a shield bash. He made another strike at her, drawing a long cut across her chest. \n\n“Yield!” Adoniah commanded loudly, giving a firm growl.\n\n“No!” Midnah reached up, attempting to slit his vulnerable throat with her short sword. \n\nAdoniah sunk his blade into the earth and gripped her forehead, causing a bright light to pulse through her frame. \n\n\nHer eyes cleared and she dropped her short swords, throwing her arms around him.\n\n“My friend… I am so… so sorry…” Her tears fell across his armored back as the sound of loud footfalls reached her ears. She turned and saw Viktor, the massive Orc, tearing through the meadow in her direction. \n\n“It is alright. We can still fix things… as we always have. I am sorry…”\n\nThey spoke to each other, in direct opposition, but with a single voice.\n\n“For what I must do.” \n\nMidnah drew the Wanderer's Bow and aimed for the head as Adoniah gripped the Holy Avenger and lunged forward. Thunder cracked from the heavens above, shattering the world as the lives of two Magi ended in perfect synchrony.\n\n“NO!” Viktor’s voice rang out as he bounded towards his companions, whose bodies lay limp on the earth. Adoniah's skull penetrated by an arrow delivered at full draw and point blank range. Midnah's chest pierced by a holy blade.\n\n“No… no, no this isn't right… I'm not seeing this, this is one of the nightmares… Adoniah… Midnah… wake up… wake up… dammit, why can't I wake up!!!” Viktor wailed into the skies. He gripped his Greataxe, and with a shaking hand touched a large, sharp piece of ivory placed just above the axehead. The foul canine of the great Titan King Chronulos.\n\n“Victory for Viktor! Haha! You should have known not to mess with an Orc!” \n\nThe past echoed in Viktor’s mind as he recalled the day that the Magi had fought as one to overwhelm the Titan King Chronulos. He reached down to Adoniah's sheath, which was encrusted with Chronulos’ molar. \n\n“Must you always be such a brute? The kill is shared amongst us all, and only through my protection did you survive.” Adoniah had chastised Viktor for his pride, but all the while he had been smiling widely.\n\nHe gripped the necklace around Midnah's supple neck and ripped it free. In the very center was Chronulos’ incisor. \n\n“What complete, utter fools… haha…” In her usual way, Midnah had been perched upon a nearby outcropping, swinging her legs back and forth. She had always been unreadable, but on that day her face showed the purest of mirth.\n\nThe past faded away, and Viktor set upon his grim task. To the northeast, he placed Adoniah's sheath. To the southeast, he lay down his Greataxe. To the west, Midnah's necklace.\n\n“Damn you, Gods above and Gods below alike! You allowed this to happen! You allowed the greatest warriors in Curtana to slay each other in cold blood! So I'll succeed where you failed! With my life, I shall allow no conflict between the peoples of Oleander, Lockhe’Balo, and Trinity! With my blood, I bring peace to these torn nations! I defy the destiny placed upon mortals, which drives us to end each other's lives!” He gave a shout, releasing all his rage, all his fear, all his hatred. More than anything else, he was releasing all his woe.\n\nViktor’s  power quickly began to fade as the earth heaved around him. In his last moments, as the earth consumed him, he lifted his friends in his two great arms. Viktor wept long and hard with his final breaths. Along the borders, from Viktor’s sacrifice and the power of King Chronulos’ teeth, massive mountains, crags, crevasses, and valleys formed. \n\nWithin the mountains a massive network of caves wound deep throughout, full of dead ends and massive pitfalls. At the very center and base of the largest mountain, which would come to be known as Mount Chronulos, the Magi peacefully rest, from now into eternity…",

        "author": "FriendsCallMeAsshole",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7v0ao8/vrchat_how_dealing_with_a_micspammer_escalated/",
        "text": "It looks like this is the first VRChat story posted on this subreddit (which I find kind of amazing, as the game is a treasure trove of rapidly emerging stories) - as such I'll give a bit of context that might be necessary for people not familiar with the game:\n\nVRChat is a game driven by user-provided content, i.e. custom avatars roleplaying random scenarios (or just hanging around) on custom maps, while interacting with each other using VR (both for vision and for controlling your limbs). You can however also play VRChat using keyboard and mouse, in which case you can't control your individual limbs however.\n\nOne of the most popular custom maps at the moment is a pub called 'the great pug', which is made up of several bar counters on several floors, a room with an 'open mic'-corner for performances, and a floor with an open fireplace and several beds.\n\nA friend and I were playing on a server with several random online players (both of us are playing the desktop version, though my friend had been thinking about ordering himself a used/refurbished oculus rift for a while now), when my friend told me he'd go afk for a bit (at that point I simply assumed he'd go take a piss, get something to drink, etc.) - which left me 'alone' in the game, and so I had to search for something new to do the server.\n\nI wandered around on the map until I got to the open mic corner, where two players were taking turns performing raps. One of the players, a guy who used a 3d model of shrek wearing gold chains around his neck as his avatar, was rather good (freestyle-rapping about the appearance of the avatars standing in front of the stage for example), while the other was a bit annoying (he only played sound files of raps by famous real rappers - so not actually rapping himself). \n\nIt is possible to block players in VRchat, but I don't think anyone blocked him, because shrek continued to only rap when it was his turn, and he also sometimes incorporated parts of the rap into his own routine. Still, it was a bit annoying that the mic-spammer wouldn't leave the stage.\n\nAfter shrek had finished another part of his and the mic-spammer was about to play another song, a guy who used one of the default avatars (guy in suit) suddenly ran up to the stage and started yelling 'oh my god, oh my god, oh my god' for a bit, and then told us that 'someone had stolen the price-money for the rap competition'.\n\nSince most of us were already looking for an excuse to get the mic-spammer to shut up, all the people in front of the stage immediately jumped in on the new scenario. We started to panic, asked who could've possibly done such a cruel thing. At this point one of the ugandan knuckles suggested that we should interrogate everyone in the pub, so that we could 'find da wae to da culprit' - which we promptly did.\n\nSo a group of ~9 people suddenly started running from floor to floor in the pub, asked people about their alibis for the last 15 minutes, most people who had an alibi started joining in on the fun, interrogating everyone they came across, people who had recently swapped avatars or didn't have an alibi were told that they were suspicious, and it only got more ridiculous from there.\n\nOn the floor with the open fire place we 'caught' a guy dropping pillows from the beds into the fire (someone who at that time probably didn't even know about the events unfolding), which immediately made him the prime suspect for 'trying to destroy evidence'. The interrogation of him could only be described as 'eight good cops, eight bad cops', with pikachu, yoda and homer simpson reassuring the suspect that he had nothing to fear, and a different pikachu, shrek the rapper and a ton of knuckles screaming at him, that they knew he did it.\n\nAt one point we also had to collectively block a player, because he kept on saying he had 'found the thief', while pointing to the only guy in the room who had a dark skinned avatar.\n\nWhile the whole series of events was already pretty amazing until this point, the absolutely cherry on top was when my friend came back from being afk.\n\nThe thing is, while he did go to the bathroom, what actually took him so long was that he had seen an auction on ebay for a used oculus rift that was about to end, which he bid on. So when he came back into the server, the first thing he (audibly for everyone) said was 'I did it! I just bought an oculus rift!'.\n\nEveryone in hearing range flipped the fuck out, screaming around that we had 'found the culprit', within a minute he was surrounded by most of the server, yelling at him that he'd go to prison for a long time, that there was no need to deny it, we had all heard his confession, etc.\n\nMy friend meanwhile had no fucking idea what was going on and was failing to get an answer to his question of 'what is happening?', because everyone assumed that he was also roleplaying, so the answers were all along the lines of 'you gonna go to jail now' or 'lying won't help you now, criminal scum.'\n\nAnd, as usual in VRchat, five minutes later everything was forgotten and things had gone back to 'normal'.",

        "text": "So I played in a short Mutants and Masterminds campaign with my friend and my brother around 2 years ago, and today I felt like  sharing a quick tale with you all.\n\nMy character was known as the Alchemist, and his two allies were a Punisher-like anti-hero and a reformed supervillain. They were attempting to save superheroes who were living in hiding after the \"Justice League\" allegory was dismantled by a mysterious force. Possibly the same group of people were now hunting down and killing living heroes. \n\nIn their search they found the location of a female hero with remarkable healing abilities, now living as an elementary school nurse. The Alchemist became separated from his allies as he tried to help the woman save children who were still in the school, as it was under attack from unknown assailants.\n\nOn their way out, the Alchemist and the woman were cornered by a villainous cyborg who the Alchemist had fought and defeated once before. The cyborg taunted the Alchemist, saying that he would kill him for what the Alchemist did to him in their last encounter. There was little time. If they didn't escape, they'd be surrounded by the strange assailants. Surely this combat was intended to be intense, high-stakes, and difficult considering the party was split. The cyborg had a grenade launcher attachment on his arm, and the Alchemist opted to fire at the launcher to ignite the grenade inside. \n\nI rolled high enough to land the hit, and the GM rolled low enough that the grenade exploded, immediately killing the cyborg and allowing the Alchemist and the woman a quick escape before they could face further danger.\n\nI doubt this was the reason that we didn't have many more sessions afterward, but it may have been part of it.",

        "text": "Hello there, wandering redditor! Welcome to another tale from the party of idiots I DM for. It's actually a pretty fun one for me to look back at, since the party's actions were so unexpected that I panicked and didn't handle the situation that well.\n\nThis situation came around the time of this story: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/79fjp3/how_accidentally_kidnapping_children_managed_to/\n\n\nThis time, the relevant characters are:\n\nAra Nailo, Elf wizard\n\nPiggy, the somehow still a chipmunk bard\n\nTorgga FrostBeard, Dwarven Barbarian\n\nAnd Thokk, half-orc fighter\n\nOnto the story. The party was actually split at the time of the first story, and unfortunately this will make it a little hard to understand. Put simply - wizard died, his player rolled a new character and did things with one half of the party whilst the others worked on resurrecting their dead buddy, but the fact this story will skip around a bit makes it a little more complex than that and if I hadn't cleared it up, it could be confusing. I should also mention that since we had 8 people now, the split halves of the party played in different sessions. \n\nSo, the first part of the story revolves around the quest to resurrect the Wizard... And it was the part I had planned. The basic jist of the resurrection plan was to take the Wizard's body to a source of magical power, and then direct a whole bunch of the power into the Wizard and resurrect him! But the slight drawback was that the magic mcguffin was in the remains of an underground dwarven citadel infested with earth elementals, and the weakened party arrives to resurrect the Wizard..... To be greeted by a wild magic surge when they try!\n\nThe end result is the Wizard is resurrected, but as an aarakokra, which ended up being fun. Anyway, they take a look around the citadel and find several cool magic items - some magic mirror thing, a ring, and one item I put in as a joke - the tentacle rod.\n\nThe Wizard takes it, and due to some feat is able to use it as a spellcasting focus? OK, so the Wizard carries this around everywhere. Not only does it get good use in a fight with some goblins, but, when this half of the party finds the mindflayer ship, it gets put to a more... Creative...use.\n\nSo, the gang have boarded the ship and killed most of the crew, except for one who was up on the flight deck, alone. The bard and wizard are trying and failing to maintain the illusion of being another mindflayer, but the important detail is that the mindflayer has not yet turned around and looked at them. In a last ditch attempt to convince him, the Wizard uses the tentacle rod to pretend they are the face tentacles of the other mindflayer kissing him from behind...., *VOMITS/*\n\nThis works, surprisingly, but then they went a step darker and pretended those other mindflayers they murdered just all committed suicide whilst he was asleep, by leaving a suicide note with the bodies. This note will not be successful, and they will be tracked down by this ultralithid who wants revenge....\n\nJust not yet.\n\n\nIn the meantime, as a result of that little trip, the Bard and barbarian are now training to work out how to use alien guns. Come to think of it, 3 out of 7 players have guns... And I think someone wants to become an artificer gunsmith.... Well. I'll be sure to tell you if anything interesting happens related to that! ",

        "text": "It's my first campaign as a DM, running Storm King's Thunder with a full table of seven not counting myself, and so far the party and players have been an absolute delight! I'm no poet, but this last session was so much fun I just had to try and document their adventure; apologies if it's a horrible mess.\n\n---\n\nDramatis Personae\n\n- Imazapyr: Human samurai. A bit obsessed with the idea of honor, although he seems to have a strange sense of it, having no problem in an underhanded sneak attack to ambush and kill Xolkin Alassandar when the Zhentarim agent arrived at Nightstone. He's out to find a clan of dwarves to ask for their allegiance in a provincial dispute that his tribe is involved in, and seems to have a kind of over-affection for dwarves as a result, repeatedly fawning over the greatness of the dwarven race and culture.\n\n- Fargrim Fellhammer: Dwarven brute. He was headed to Nightstone to deliver a message from his clan to Morak Ur'Gray, but things did not work out so simply. He has a shrewd mind for battle and a sharp wit.\n\n- Remlyn Sarethin: Drow rogue. Born to minor nobility in the Underdark, but was forced by circumstance to flee. He liquidated his family's assets and escaped with his sister to Waterdeep where they hope to establish a league of adventurers. The first steps of course would be to ingratiate himself with the local nobility, and equally important would be to find some individuals he could actually convince to join the guild he is planning to assemble. To this end he was initiated into the Black Network in order to foster contacts, soon learning of a small forest retreat popular among the local nobles. He rode out for Nightstone, and en route he met with the Seven Snakes, and tried to assist them in their doomed at taking Nightstone by force. Xolkin, Kella, and a handful of the other Snakes were killed outright, Remlyn was spared by the dwarf who he had met on the Trade Way from Waterdeep. The surviving Snakes fled and left him for dead, and when he came to, bound and disarmed, he realized that the town had been sacked and so cut a deal with the rest of the party, hoping to salvage his mission by insinuating himself among them so he might recruit them later. Despite this, he still sometimes seems standoffish to his fellow adventurers, but when repelling an orc raid on the settlement that night he proved he wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty, cementing his place among them.\n\n- Tomothy Smoth: Half-elf arcane archer. A wandering adventurer in search of something to occupy himself with. Slightly on the fickle side, but dependable when it matters, he and Zzildarr had been travelling together for some time before meeting the rest of the party.\n\n- Zzildarr: White-dragonborn sorcerer. A stranger from far away, he claims to have been sent out into the world to make a name for himself and his clan. He and Tomothy hit it off from the moment they met, and the two have been carousing and raising hell up and down the sword coast for months, seemingly causing as much trouble as they solve. He specializes in devastating ice magic, and in not understanding such social sensibilities as tact or grace.\n\n- Kyrene Gavras: Human; a sorcerer by birth and a scholar by trade. Her family was well-known for producing powerful mages that could control the weather itself, although the ability seemed to skip one or more generations unpredictably. She was the first of her line in years to manifest these gifts, but she shunned her unnatural talents, preferring to find renown on her own terms. She found fulfillment in study, and eventually focused her research on giants, what happened to their kingdoms of old, and what became of them to bring about their current state. She has recently heard rumors of actual giant activity in the Savage Frontier, where legends had it that ancient Ostoria use to lie. Spurred by this news, she decided to take to the field and attempt some hands-on study. After arriving in Nightstone, the harsh violent reality of the world outside and the constant and permeating presence of Death seems to have shaken her.\n\n- Morgan: A red-dragonborn warlock who was assigned as an escort of sorts to Kyrene by the college. Very business-like, short and to the point. She tends to stay out of conflict and conversation unless prompted by Kyrene, but will quickly jump into combat to protect her charge.\n\n---\n\nAfter dispatching the orc raid the night before, the party bunks down in the abbey near the gate, then at first light they head out to try and locate the missing villagers in the caves to the north- they find tracks that seem to have been caused by the townsfolk fleeing to the Dripping Caves. As they approach the southern mouth of the Caves, they see a few goblins tied up outside hanging by their wrists, bickering about whose fault it was that they failed their Boss in taking Nightstone's treasures, and who will be fed to Hark's pet worgs next. While the party debates how to proceed, an ogre stomps out and yells at the restrained goblins, telling them to shut up, then sits down and glares at them. After discussion about how well-prepared they are to take an ogre on in a frontal assault, the party hunts around for alternative entrances and eventually discover a side passage leading in from the east and decide it would be wise to take this less-obvious approach. As they enter the cave, Remlyn casts Light on Zzildar's crystal pendant which he uses as a magical focus, so that those of the party without the gift of darkvision can navigate the cave- so long as Zzildarr remains nearby at least. With the logistics accounted for, they enter the narrow tunnel.\n\nRemlyn and Fargrim lead the way, and the two of them are initially wary of a hollowed-out stalagmite which sits in the middle of a conspicuously empty antechamber, but eventually Fargrim heads slightly further in down the north passage to keep an eye out and Remlyn scouts ahead down the west corridor. The drow discovers a natural freshwater spring and a patch of strange mushrooms growing nearby, and after briefly contemplating how many he can carry, he grabs half a dozen and puts them away in a spare empty pouch. Unfortunately, the cave's resident Black Pudding detected this movement near the spring and slithers out of its hiding place in the perforated stalagmite to feed on its unwitting prey. Zzildarr notices the movement however, and a brief fight breaks out. Fargrim is quick to jump into the fray, and unfortunately learns that his weapons and armor do not well tolerate contact with the corrosive slime creature. Tomothy, on the other hand, quickly runs away up the north exit, completely disengages from the fight, and repeatedly entreats his allies to just run. An unfortunate spell choice from Kyrene hits the blob with a jolt of electricity, causing it undergo mitosis and split into two smaller versions of itself- one chases Remlyn back down the passage to the spring while the rest of the party is busy dispatching the first. Once cornered, the drow attempts to jump over and past the pudding, and misses it narrowly enough that his leather armor catches on it and is dissolved away. He makes it back around the corner and when the blob follows him, almost the entire party blasts it with whatever ranged attacks they had at their disposal. The party quickly regroups, and Kyrene has a premonition that she should leave- she's seen enough death and dying- much to her chagrin she has even personally dealt it herself in the past day more than once, and this place seems to have an oppressive and choking aura of death about it which she cannot abide. She bids the party good luck, assures Morgan that she can find her way back to town safely, then returns for Nightstone.\n\nThe party heads further into the cave, once more led by Remlyn, but as soon as they enter the main chamber the rogue is spotted by a goblin on a ledge along the cave wall to the north, who cries out. He quickly scales a wall to his left and dispatches one sentry, but the damage is done- the alarm is sounded, and a chorus of \"BREE-YARK!\" rings out from other goblins in the cave. Fargrim scales the ledge to attack the goblin who sounded the alert, but the slippery creature evades his strike and tries to escape, with Remlyn in pursuit. The rest of the party quickly rushes out of the claustrophobic passage just in time for an ogress to emerge from the cluster of stalagmites in the center of the cavern. Tomothy strikes down a goblin along the south wall, and then becomes engaged in an exchange of arrows with a goblin on the far southwest side of the cavern, unable to hit it, but taking a number of arrows in the side for his trouble. He spies a goblin in the northwest end of the cavern jump down from its ledge and disappear down a passageway. In the meantime, the rest of the party had engaged the ogress in combat and were dodging swings from her greatclub when the other ogre, who had been spotted previously sitting at the south entrance, hears the commotion, returns to see his mate being attacked, and rushes into combat with an angry roar. Meanwhile, Remlyn has backed his quarry against a sheer drop into a black pit, but as the saying goes a cornered best is the most dangerous, and he cannot land a clean hit, while the goblin repeatedly slashes at him, badly draining his stamina. Eventually he is joined by Fargrim and Imazapyr, and the three of them manage to finally dispatch the resilient drowsbane of a goblin before returning to the fight in the main cave, but not before the three take note of the villagers holed up in the secluded area of the cave and advise them to stay where they are until the coast is clear. Up on the southeast ledge, Tomothy continues to exchange volleys with his goblin opponent, who is rejoined by the sentry that had run off earlier, although the second goblin is hasty and overdraws his bow, snapping its string- he quickly retreats behind a ledge and attempts to sneak forward so as to use of his blade in close combat. The two ogres continue to fight ferociously, but as Fargrim and Imazapyr rejoin the fight the ogres are quickly outflanked by the adventurers and before long the two giant-kin both fall dead to the ground with a pair of resounding crashes. The party advances over the ogrish corpses, and Zzildarr and Morgan catch the sneaky goblin and quickly dispose of it just as Tomothy's arrow finally flies true and the last sentry dies with an arrow in its chest.\n\nAlthough winded, the adventurers have little time to rest, as they can hear that more goblins have been roused by the sound of battle. Not only that, but a number of them hear a human's moans of pain coming from the southwest passage. Imazapyr, Zzildarr, and Tomothy rush in to discover that this corner of the cave appears to be the goblins' warrens, filled with dozens of unarmed and unarmored goblins, who do nothing but cower as they rush past. During the excitement, Remlyn staggers back up to hide on the southeast outcropping and stops to catch his breath as Morgan and Fargrim move to the mouth of the warrens entrance; Fargrim tries to frighten the goblins, but they only hiss back angrily in response. Deep within the warrens, Imazapyr, Zzildarr, and Tomothy discover a gruesome sight- a human man, presumably one of the survivors of the attack on Nightstone, being eaten alive by a swarm of goblins, and from the looks of it they've been feeding for a few hours already- it seems only thanks to the cruelty of fate that he has not already died of his wounds. Imazapyr arrives first and begins hacking away at the goblins, Zzildarr follows shortly with Tomothy close behind. The sorcerer unleashes his dragonbreath, felling the entire mass of goblins and ending the poor man's suffering. The dragonborn lingers in the warren for a moment, while Imazapyr and Tomothy head out, visibly shaken, but they indicate that there's nothing to be done. Remlyn remains hidden among the stalagmites and pulls out a deck of cards to amuse himself while his companions move on.\n\nFargrim rushes on to the northern passages and accidentally runs headlong into Boss Hark and his bodyguards, just as his three worgs are finishing up in feeding on a goblin who had presumably displeased his leader in some way, perhaps he had been one of the goblins hanging outside earlier? The dwarf swears loudly at his luck to trip into the enemy unprepared. Upon hearing him Tomothy leads Imazapyr and Morgan through the darkness north to follow, but the two quickly lose their guide. Zzildarr leaves the warren, and tries to make a show of his power to the remaining few dozen goblins by whipping up a small flurry and gale around himself, but he misjudges the strength of his magic (and the weakness of these goblins), and the whole lot of them are violently bashed into the walls and killed. He looks around silently for a moment before rushing north to rejoin his comrades. Farther north in the cave, Imazapyr is separated from the party and accidentally heads for the farther north of the two tunnels, and in a patch of dim light from a natural chimney, he discovers Beedo- a goblin that the party had captured, interrogated, and subsequently freed back in Nightstone the day before. He warns the goblin to stand down and Beedo nods and retreats behind the curve of the cave wall, so he he moves on. Back in the lower passage, Morgan keeps track of Tomothy for slightly longer, but is left behind in an antechamber along the southern of the two paths. After a moment of surprise, Boss Hark sets upon the dwarf who showed up uninvited, but before his bodyguards and pet worgs can fall in behind him, Imazapyr emerges from a side passage and intercepts them by the light spilling from the nearby chimney, and he neatly decapitates one of the worgs. Just then Tomothy falls in behind Fargrim and launches a magical arrow which explodes into a hail of shards and dispatches both bodyguards and injures the nearby worgs. At the sound of combat escalating, Remlyn briefly looks up and readies his crossbow, but after nothing emerges, he returns to his solitaire; absentmindedly, he takes out one of the mushrooms he discovered earlier and sniffs it, surmises that it may have some medicinal properties and then eats it while waiting for his fellow adventurers to finish whatever it was they were doing. Hark and Fargrim exchange blows, but both of them are well-armored, so for each of them just as many blows are deflected as strike true, and they are both quickly exhausted by the melee. Zzildarr finally catches up, arriving from behind Imazapyr, and throws his arcane power into the fight. Perhaps more importantly, bringing back the light cast by his amulet allows Morgan to spot Hark and land a devastating blast of magic which fells the goblin boss for goot. The last remaining worg lunges at Fargrim and drags the dwarf to the ground, incapacitating him a mere moment before a hail of blows from the other adventurers fell it as well, and a deafening silence overtakes the cavern. At the same time, Remlyn feels violently ill and quietly collapses into convulsions- he had unfortunately misjudged his mycelial snack, and poisoned himself. The party has little time to celebrate their victory just yet, as Fargrim lay bleeding out on the cave floor, getting paler by the second. They fumbled to try and close his wounds, but nothing seemed to work, meanwhile across the cave the drow rogue continued to silently aspirate. Just as the last hint of color is leaving Fargrim's lips, Morgan staunches the bleeding, and the dwarf's ragged breathing evens out. Back near the cave entrance, Remlyn gasps awake, having unconsciously vomited up the offending snack and narrowly avoided drowning in his own sick.\n\nWith the excitement ended, the party takes stock of their situation- alive, but badly injured and worn out. They look around Hark's room and find the goblin boss' hoard inside an unlocked treasure chest, and discover a rickety door in the far north corner of his cave. They open it to discover a terrified woman who, after some coaxing and calming by the party, introduces herself as Daphne Featherstone, lady-in-waiting to Lady Velrosa Nandar. Miss Featherstone was apparently being kept in Hark's \"larder\", which is to say that she was next on the menu, so to speak. She is distraught with her situation and nearly incoherent, simply repeating that she must see to the Lady Nandar and ensure she is well. Nobody has the heart to break the news to her. Nobody except Zzildarr, that is, who bluntly relays the news with his characteristic lack of awareness. The poor woman breaks down into hysterics, and the party is forced to all but carry her back over to where the rest of the surviving villagers are, also collecting their erstwhile goblin \"friend\" Beedo and once again tying him up until they decide what to do with him. Too exhausted at this point to continue, they assign a watch rotation among themselves and some of the surviving guards and settle in for a well-earned rest...",

        "text": "Flamer's death didn't mark the end of the game, not by a long shot. It's been roughly seven months since I played that particular adventure, and twenty six years in-game. There have been so many amazing adventures since then; the planar collapse, the ancient Tsethem, the downfall prophecy... Not to mention the fantastic spinoff adventures about Tirkosu starting to bleed into our world, the modern world. So many good characters, too; Theo Longstrider, Chloe, Ikeer... \n\nBut that's the thing about Empai Tirkosu. It's constantly changing, evolving, and revealing new mysteries about itself. It's essentially endless. I've had so many false stops where I've gone \"okay this is it, time to wrap it up and start a new game\", only to find myself returning once again to that magical island. It doesn't have an end, and that makes it a real joy to play in. \n\nUnfortunately it doesn't make for a very good gametale. Flamer's death was the closest I got to an actual finalé, so in the interest of a good narrative I'm going to leave the tale there. Its been a hell of a ride; this is the first time I've written anything properly (not counting Turf's memoirs, and that doesn't count because they were in character), so all your encouragement and criticisms were greatly appreciated. \n\nI think my next project is going to be a campaign guide to the land of Tirkosu, and potentially a little adventure module to go with it. I've had a couple of people express a desire to actually play in the world, and in one truly bizarre incident, I met someone who actually had. \n\nIt happened while I was messing around on this roleplay site called Shamchat. If there's one area that solo play lacks in, it's dialogue. It's very hard to get a sense of how a character speaks when you're playing on your own, so I remedy this by taking to roleplay chat sites to \"train\" my characters' personalities. \n\nThis one time while I was playing Vanella, I was matched with someone called \"Honcho, the head honcho\". After an introduction he asked V'nell where she came from, and she mentioned Tirkosu. He asked, \"you mean Empai Tirkosu?\", and she said yes. After a bit of back and forth, I went OOC to ask how he knew the island's old name. \n\nHis reply: \"We visited it in our plane-hopping WH40k campaign.\"\n\nI was mind blown. Not just that someone would read about my world and like it enough to include it in their own game, but that I happened to meet a player from that game, who happened to be using the same obscure chat site as me, who happened to pressure V'nell into telling her the name of her home (which she usually describes as \"jus' a tiny lil' island inna middle o' nowhere\"). I was like, \"Dude, *I created that world a few months ago!*\" and he was all \"Holy #&amp;$@, no way\". \n\nSo a setting guide is on the cards next, but for now the tale is over. To wrap things up nicely, I'm gonna include some \"extras\". Think of them like the maps and such that you'd find at the back of a fantasy novel. \n\n[The island of Tirkosu.](https://i.imgur.com/2udM0ud.png) This was the third rendition of the map, and the most professional looking. Many thanks to my sis for the tips and tricks. \n\n[The original Tsethem](https://i.imgur.com/nmekmUD.png).

And to go with that, the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzU26jUnE7k) that inspired the adventure. \n\n[Vanella and Aelar Liadon in their *Magnificent Mansion*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7fflxv/art_mordenkainens_magnificent_mansion_is_just_the/)\n\n[A Valkeesh footsoldier.](https://i.imgur.com/Y7mC81W.png)\n\n[Every single character](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7p3cbq/art_celebrating_50_characters_in_pixel_art/) that reached past 3rd level, rendered in pixel art.

I hope you had even a fraction as much fun listening to these stories as I had playing them. \n\nUntil we meet again. \\**plane-hops away*\\*",

They weren't of the pleasant kind, either. Eventually they got so bad that they plane-hopped to Della's palace at Erhu Eeki to ask for her assistance in deciphering them. She was happy to help, and had plenty of time on her hands; the plane of air had flourished under her rule more than any of the original Tsethem. \n\nWhat she discovered through prayer and meditation was rather shocking; the Valkeesh were back. During the following years after Marianne Sterling had brought her fiance back from non-existence, several people had started going missing. Most assumed it was simply due to planefall, but Cody's dreams proved different. They had been abducted by the alien beings who had supposedly perished on the Great War. \n\nCodix had been experimented upon from a child, giving him psychic powers similar to those posessed by the Valkeesh. Viki had suffered a similar fate, albeit at a later age. But their minds were strong, and the literal brainwashing they received wasn't enough to make them slaves to their captors. Together they had broken out of the cells in the astral ship and escaped back to Tirkosu. This was where I had picked up their tale, and started playing them. \n\nThe Valkeesh had appeared to be going with a stealth invasion approach, at least initially. Della was worried about the whole matter. How many others had been set upon the island as sleeper assassins? If they had been abducting people since 5 AFO, why hadn't they already revealed themselves? She resolved to bring the Tsethem together again to investigate. \n\n* * *\n\nOut of game I was almost certain that Sterling was behind the delay in the Valkeesh's plans. Her astral HQ had contained the slimy teleporting stuff that had allowed Viki and Cody to escape the asteroid. There had to be a connection. And besides, it made sense: she was intent on taking down the Tsethem, some of the most powerful being on the planes. What better way to do it than with an army of squid aliens? \n\nThere was a storm coming. I just didn't know how bad it was until it struck. \n\n* * *\n\nIt was a song that cemented this as one of my favorite adventures. Do You Realize, by Ursine Vulpine. The music was appropriately epic, but the lyrics really made it for me. \n\n*\"Do you realize? That you have the most, beautiful face?\"*\n\nFlamer stood looking down at Della. I don't generally do \"ships\" of characters from any story, let alone my own creations. But if there was ever a couple who would have been perfect for each other, it would be Flamey and Dell. The kingly gentleman and the purest soul. It was just a shame that he was a metal man, and she was a cleric. \n\n*\"Do you realize? We're floating, in space?\"*\n\nThey were standing on an asteroid floating across the canvas of the astral plane, lit by a multitude of colours from the thousands of stars. Flamey looked regal as always, Della as sweet as a breath of air. He had been on the move for just over eighteen years now, traveling the planes and accumulating much knowledge; more than even I could fathom, at the time. \n\n*\"Do you realize? That happiness, makes you cry?\"*\n\nDella was indeed crying tears of joy. They had occasionally seen each other, once every five years or so. Every meeting was a time of happiness for both of them. But this time it was different. There was a hint of sadness in Flamer's eyes that was mirrored in Dell's tears. \n\n*\"Do you realize? Everyone you know... Someday... Will die?*\n\nThat was when Della broke down. He knew the truth of what she'd done, so many years ago after the bloodless war. She was forty six years old now, but she looked closer to twenty. \n\nShe was an undying. Someone who didn't physically age. Who could, theoretically, live until the end of the world. Just like Flamer. \n\nThe Supreme One had offered her the gift of eternal youth, so that the Hopefuls would have a strong head to look to at all times. She had accepted, although the strength of her faith was only partly the reason why; she was also doing it for her friend, Flamey. Immortality is a very lonely path and she didn't want him to go it alone. She was still coming to terms with what that meant for her: she was going to watch nearly everyone she knew grow old and die. But she was prepared to accept that fate, if it meant being there for her friend.\n\nThe rest of the music played out almost like a non-canon trailer for the coming adventure. Thunderous drums as Marianne appeared at the helm of a massive fleet of Valkeesh warships, epic strings as Flamer went supernova and Della called the wind to her aid, and a finish up with the words that spoke the terrible truth about her decision:\n\n*\"Do you realize? Everyone you know... Someday... Will die?\"* \n\n* * *\n\nMarianne's plan was simple. Over the years she had discovered how to create devastation orbs, like the one used by the Primadans to bomb Rahg Krahv. She would smuggle one into each village on Tirkosu and use them to hold the islanders hostage; the Tsethem would have no choice but to surrender. \n\nSterling was insane, but also genius. She created these small versions of airships, using two EPEs and a bicycle-like frame, and instructed the brainwashed slaves of the Valkeesh to sell them on Tirkosu. They quickly became the newest fad for the wealthy. \n\nEach one contained a devastation orb, primed to explode at the touch of a button. \n\nUnfortunately there was a variable Marianne hadn't taken into account: Vanella Liadon. V'nell couldn't wait to get her hands on a personal airship. Such compact EPEs hasn't been seen since the Great War, and she was intrigued as to how they'd been crafted. As soon as she'd forked over the gold to buy one of the PAs, she started disassembling and tinkering with it in her garage. \n\nAnd subsequently set off the orb. She survived, of course. It wasn't the first time she'd taken an explosion to the face. But Little Orthraze was all but destroyed. The orb hadn't drawn its power from one of the ten normal elements; it was fueled by Shadow. Thousands of gnomes were killed in the blast. Homes were disintegrated or swallowed by shadow energy. Mirlings almost immediately began swarming up out of the Dark Mirror. \n\nMarianne hadn't counted on this, but she was quick to use it to her advantage. The terrified inhabitants of Tirkosu watched as hundreds of betentacled warships descended from the skies. Their threatening presence loomed above the island as in the days of old. Soldiers descended onto the island using smaller craft, swarming like so many flies. The Valkeesh had returned, defying their vanquish by Michael Thane. And this time there was no magic device to erase them. \n\nTo put into perspective how warped Marianne's perception was: she was using the Valkeesh, the ruthless invaders that her beloved Michael had given his life to destroy, to get revenge on the Tsethem. That was how far gone she was. \n\nShe stood plugged into the helm of the mothership, her countless mechanical implants and enhancements allowing her to interface with the alien tech. She could control the whole hivemind from there, and she used that power now to amplify her voice out over every ship hanging in the sky. \n\n\"Citizens of Tirkosu! Little Orthraze lies in shadow. More destruction will follow if the Tsethem refuse to comply.\"\n\n\"You have three days, *protectors*. Three days to deliver yourselves onto my soldiers at Rahm Oru, where containment is waiting. I know both you and I do not wish for any more innocent blood to be spilt. So prove yourselves worthy of your title, and lay down your lives for the people.\"\n\n\"Pretty please.\"\n\n* * *\n\nIt was checkmate. Little Orthraze now resembled its larger namesake, and the other villages would soon follow if the Tsethem didn't comply. They had no choice but to convene on Rahm Oru. \n\nTurf, Lundal, Della and Flamer all plane-hopped back onto their island home once again, and were met by Elo and Vanella. Vindicus was traveling the planes at the time, so he missed all the action. Inalak and Korena were let through the Valkeesh sieges on their respective villages, and headed for the city. Callie, Kilmorn, and Pekeski did the same, but before leaving Pernep they instructed Codix and Vikina to find the last remaining Tsethem; Jaques Torrem. \n\nJaques had rarely been seen since the invasion of Tiamat, and the subsequent death of his wife. He'd moved from Paku and taken his five kids to live in the southern mountains, a day's walk from Pernep. He'd actually renovated the old dragon cult cabin that he and his team had cleared way back when. He was forty nine years old now, and had shaggy hair and beard reminiscent of a yak. \n\nHe wasn't too happy to have the mystics turning up on his doorstep. After Tikka's passing he'd sworn never to get mixed up in Tsethem nonsense again. It took them a while to get him to stop squaring up to them, let alone to actually talk. And even then, he wasn't having any of it. The world burn for all he cared; he wasn't going to risk his kids losing their father. \n\nUnfortunately he didn't have a choice. A bunch of Valkeesh soldiers descended on the cabin and nearly killed them all. Jaques and his family fled into the forest, and the mystics followed. Viki sent a mental message to the Tsethem; the aliens were after Jaques. \n\nIt was risky disobeying Marianne's orders, but the four original Tsethem couldn't stand by while their friend was hunted. The ported to the cabin just in time to catch up with the full force of around twenty elite Valkeesh. \n\nIt was a slaughter. None of them were prepared for the kind of psychic power the invaders possessed. Lundal was teleported into a demiplane right at the start of the battle. Della went down next, swamped by a mob of the brain-eating creatures. Turf spent the whole fight stunned due to her lack of willpower, and Flamer collapsed after being hit by ten psychic blasts at the same time. They were only saved at the last minute by Lundal, who returned from the demiplane and teleported them back to the besieged Rahm Oru. \n\nKorena quickly resurrected them, but they were still shocked by their defeat. This really demonstrated how dangerous an enemy the Valkeesh were. True, the ones they had faced were significantly more powerful than the standard soldiers, but there were still several thousand of them. \n\nDay one came and went. The Tsethem rested and planned their next move. \n\n* * *\n\nJaques and his family had been secured onboard one of the prison ships, which Della managed to divine thanks to some handy visions from the Supreme One. She and Inalak snuck onto it and freed them with minimal trouble. As they flew back down, Flamer, Lundal, and Vanella passed them by on their way to the mothership. It was time for the final push. \n\nThe fought their way onto the ship and headed for the bridge. The squid-shaped craft distorted gravity on the inside, meaning they could run up the length of the ship as though it was the ground. Marianne could see them coming, they were sure of it. She would detonate the devastation orbs and spread shadowy doom across the whole island. But that didn't worry them. \n\nBecause Della Yue had turned the sun holy. \n\nDivine Intervention is probably the most powerful ability in the game. It's basically *Wish*, but you can actually use it properly without the universe twisting your words. Unlike with a wish, your deity actually wants you to succeed. So when Della called upon the Supreme One in their hour of need, he answered her prayer. \n\nYou see, the stars and sun in Empai Tirkosu are actually portals on the astral plane, which is why the stars are multicoloured. The sun is a giant portal to the plane of fire. Della's prayer had switched it to the plane of light, bathing the whole island in holy radiance. The devastation orbs couldn't unleash shadow onto an area that was basically under the effect of a *Hallow* spell. They were useless. \n\nMarianne had been so sure of herself this time. But D&amp;D isn't chess. There's no such thing as checkmate. \n\n* * *\n\nThe final showdown took place on the bridge. The Valkeesh had charged on the villages below, and the other Tsethem were fighting back. But they would eventually fall unless Vanella intervened. Flamer had learnt many things on his travels, including secrets about their enemy; The Valkeesh were a hivemind. If the central nervous system went down, it could cause a chain reaction. They had to get V'nell to the main controls. \n\nWhich was where Marianne was standing when they found her. The double doors hissed open to reveal the alien command room, dominated by a giant mass of tentacles and wires at the far end. Marianne unplugged herself, a wild hatred in her eyes. \n\n\"*You!* You ruin.... Everything!\"\n\nShe spat the words at the three heroes. The spellpunk aesthetic had never been stronger than this; Lundal piloting his mech as though it was an extention of his own self, V'nell encased in a mechanical suit of armor that had impossibly unfolded from her gauntlets, and the seams between Flamer's golden plating glowing with an internal fire. It was the latter who stepped forward to speak in his low, gravelly voice. \n\n\"No. We protect, everything. Always have done, always will do. For we, are the Tsethem: protectors of the world.\"\n\nHis armor began to shift and transform. Flamer was going nova for the last time. \n\n\"And all enemies of peace, would be wise...\"\n\nYellow eyes fixed on his foe, fire pouring from his hands. Machine against creator. Hero against villain. \n\n\"...to fear our name.\" \n\n* * *\n\nThere had never been a battle like this, and I really don't know if I'll ever experience a better one. I had been disappointed in both of Sterling's previous combats, but now it all made sense; she was being saved for this moment. And boy, did she deliver. \n\nThe combat was fantastically dynamic because she was a threat both in and out of melee, and had plenty of spells to give her the advantage. There was no \"standing still and hitting each other until one falls over\". Sterling weaved in and out of the combatants, using the mechanical wings that had burst from her back as a means of offense and navigation. The trapped Flamer in a *Forcecage*, only for him to be teleported out by Vanella. Lundal was constantly switching positions in order to deal maximum sneak attack damage. If D&amp;D combat was like a dance, this was the most beautifully choreographed battle I'd ever seen. \n\nIt wasn't just the mechanical aspect, either; before they'd left Rahm Oru, Flamer had taken V'nell aside for a moment. His quest for knowledge had dug up many secrets, more than even I knew at the time. But one of them he felt he had to share with the Warforged girl. The origin of their race. This had been bugging me for a while, and I finally knew the truth thanks to Flamey. The events of the Great War had scrambled people's memories of that time, so much was obvious. But apparently it had messed with their perception of history, too. \n\nBack before the island's creation, there had been a race of snake people known as the Lamia. They were the \"Chosen\" race of Fire, just like the humans were of Dust, or the Golath of Ice. While it was true that their kind had taken heavy casualties in the Planar War, a small portion had survived and were evacuated to Tirkosu. After the Colossi had sealed off the plane of shadow, nearly every single Lamia decided to stay on the island instead of return to the plane of fire. It had become their home. In time, the other planes forgot about them. \n\nThen the Valkeesh appeared and started the Great War. They had been content to hover in the skies, \"harvesting\" the islanders at intervals and shooting down any resistance. Their psychic powers seemed unstoppable, until Michael Thane started the Warforged program. He and Marianne designed the perfect metal warrior, who's mechanical minds were a lot more resistant to the Valkeesh's psionics. But there was a problem: each Warforged needed a soul to \"pilot\" them. \n\nSo they staged a mass-murder under the guise of protection. They rounded up the entire village of Lamia and confined them to an underground laboratory in the mountains. Vanella had actually discovered it in the years following the invasion of Tiamat, but she hadn't put together the significance of the horrific death machines contained inside. The souls of every man, woman, and child had been sacrificed in order to create an army that could stand against the Valkeesh. \n\nAnd Marianne had been at the center of the genocide. So Lundal wasn't just fighting to save the island. Vanella wasn't just fighting her \"mother\". Flamer wasn't just fighting to get revenge for the slaughter of the Warforged. They were fighting to avenge a whole race. \n\n* * *\n\nWhile the battle below against the Valkeesh was feverish, it was nothing compared to the one on the mothership. The bridge was lit by Flamer's nova form, casting weird shadows over the metallic walls. For a moment the three of them seemed to be winning.\n\nAnd then Marianne cast *Feeblemind*. V'nell had seen her down an astral dragon with that spell, and now she was on the receiving end. She staggered back out of the fight, hardly able to remember how to walk, let alone cast spells. \n\nFlamer and Lund retorted with all the power they could muster, but their strengths were waning. Marianne's melee attacks dealt levels of exhaustion, which are so brutal that even a transforming, regenerating demigod like Flamey is susceptible to them. Each blow was crippling to the old veteran.\n\nWhen it finally ended he was only one wing slash away from death. He slammed his creator, his murderer, into the wall, chanelling every last ounce of power into her. Marianne screamed as her mechanical skeleton melted her from the inside. Her face contorted before bursting into flames, and her mechanical body sank to the ground in a charred mess. \n\nThe battle was won, but the war was lost. Vanella had been the only one with the prowess to shut down the Valkeesh's nervous system without plugging directly into the ship. Even Lundal didn't have enough expertise. They couldn't shut them down. \n\nThat was the moment I knew that it was his time. \n\nFlamer staggered over to the command station, Lundal pleading with him to wait until they found another way. But the prince of steam knew in his heart that this was the only way. If they couldn't shut the hivemind down, they could potentially blow it up. Flamer and Vanella were the only one who could plug into the controls, and V'nell was out of the picture.\n\nLund gathered the almost comatose Vanella into his arms, and stood ready to jump from a breach in the wall. He looked back at Flamer, who sitting like a king with the pipes sticking out the back of his skull. He gave his old friend a humble, mechanical smile. \n\n\"Live long, friend. Live well.\"\n\nLundal jumped and flew down toward the island. The mothership above him trembled beneath a shockwave. The whole armada seemed to disintegrate, metal turning to a fine white ash. The Valkeesh collapsed all over the island like puppets with their strings cut, saving the exhausted Tsethem from their clutches. \n\nLundal descended to Rahm Oru. There was no need for him to explain, as the look on his eyes said everything. Flamer was gone, sacrificing his own life to save their own. To say that Della was distraught is a shallow description of the grief she felt.\n\nIn a way, this was the endgame. The game had started with Flamer ten months ago, and in that time it had grown to be so much more. Flamey, Della, Lund and Turf... They weren't just character sheets to level up every now and again. They weren't just heroes of their respective elements. They were people who I'd watched grow and change over the in-game years. I'd become more attached to these fictional characters than I'd ever thought possible, and Flamey's death really brought that into perspective. If this was a movie, it would have ended here. \n\nBut it isn't a movie, and the game had to go on. Della reversed V'nell's lobotomy, but Lundal stopped her from trying to resurrect Flamer. He told her that this was how he'd want to go, fighting the good fight. He later proved to be right, because when Dell secretly tried to bring him back she found that his soul was unwilling. \n\nIt was Vanella who addressed the nagging thought st the back of everyone's minds. \n\n\"Mom. I know ya still out there. Ya came back once, an' ya can pro'lly do it again. If ya can hear me... Don't come after us. 'Cuz we beat'cha this time, an' we'll keep on beatin' ya. We're gonna do it as long as it takes to put'cha down for good. We're the protectors o' this world. We're the line in the sand.\"\n\nShe turned her eyes skyward, her normally blank face expressing a hint of determination. \n\n\"You know who we are.\"\n\nThe Tsethem bowed their heads as the ash floated down, spending a moment of silence to remember Flamer: The man who had been killed and reborn to fight a war he had finally ended. The original Tsethem, and the former prince of elemental fire. \n\nThe last Warforged.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n",

        "text": "A word from Me, the GM...\r\n\r\nBefore I continue the story of Young Jethro Rambola, Jethro's Little Friend and their forlorn tale of taxes, murder and intrigue (and their long suffered, unfortunately tolerated, social burden of a companion - Silky the Rat Boy), let me first please offer my sincere apologies for the 7 month gap between posting part 2 and part 3. It has been an interesting time. I can only apologise. \r\nSometimes, real-life gets in the way.\r\n\r\nBut enough of that, for if you are reading this then you are here to hear about Jethro and the tax men, not my unfortunate nonsense.\r\n\r\nP.S. I will link part 1 and 2 here in an edit but for now if you need those, either check below (the bot may link them) or check my submissions. What am I doing... you all know how to Reddit.\r\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6gobhg/get_me_to_the_church_part_1_how_to_make_friends)\n\n\n[Part 2a](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6ilent/get_me_to_the_church_part_2a_to_catch_a_thief)\n\n\n[Part 2b](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6ilhmd/get_me_to_the_church_part_2b_to_catch_a_thief)\n\n\n\r\nPart 3a...\r\n\r\nIn the last instalment, Jethro and Jethro’s Little Friend had accumulated the town’s tax money - mostly without any help or indeed any constructive effort of any kind from Silky - and had set off to deliver it when they were robbed by mercs-pretending-to-be-bandits who worked for the villainous money lender. Not happy to have been robbed, Jethro and JLF then, through sheer determination (and lucky dice rolls) chased, caught and butchered the merc-leader and stole back the town’s silver. Earning themselves some highly-profitable corpse looting privileges in the process. \r\n\r\nAs the session began Jethro and JLF were making their way back to Oakridge from the ~~murder~~ scene of righteous vengeance, both smiling broadly - despite the still fairly severe injuries poor JLF was suffering from, which had only been exacerbated by his recent stint of being crushed by his horse. \r\n\r\nAll of this left him still finding it somewhat awkward to breathe. \r\n\r\nStill, at least now he was walking at a fairly leisurely pace rather than tied to the saddle of a speeding horse. A horse he had promptly ran to the point of exhaustion and collapse. Ah... good times!\r\n\r\n\r\nSilky on the other hand had been left at the site of the initial robbery, passed out cold on a now horseless wagon, sat in the middle of a dusty road that weaves through the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Silky was not eaten by wolves or bears. I had considered it, but the risk rolls dictated that no, Silky gets to live. And so live he did.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have heard much to date about the exploits of Jethro and JLF, let us now hear about Silky's various endeavours instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so, skipping back to yesterday afternoon...\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon waking, Silky was displeased to find himself abandoned by his companions (yes Silky... it isn’t fun when the shoe is on the other foot is it?). \r\n\r\n\r\nHis abandonment, coupled with his throbbing headache, several missing teeth, a busted jaw, a smashed nose and the prospect of a long and lonely walk back to town, had left Silky (Player and PC) in a fairly rotten mood. \r\n\r\n\r\nSulkily, he gathered all of his belongings (which consisted entirely of the truly mammoth task of picking up his knife) and set off walking back to Oakridge. He left the wagon, the food, the water and the infamous ~~bag~~ great-shield of oats behind. He contemplated taking some food for the journey, but then realised that unless he mushed it all up to paste his fucked up jaw would unfortunately prohibit him from chewing anything. Opting not to suffer the fairly humiliating ordeal of trying to funnel pasted-food-mush into his broken and painful mouth, Silky decided that he would simply manage without eating until getting his jaw tended to.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his long walk back to town (it took him a little over a day and a half to walk back) Silky contemplated the recent robbery. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe did not believe it was a chance robbery. \r\n\r\n\r\nSure, bandits were an occasional threat on the roads deeper south, towards the city, but not up here. He reasoned that too few people travelled this road regularly to make it a profitable patch for banditry and so someone had to have organised this robbery. And that meant it must have been someone who knew about the money. Someone back in town. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem was... literally everyone had known about the money. \r\n\r\n\r\nSilky pondered who would have the means to organise this.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, as Silky's player discussed Silky's thoughts with me (The GM) as he walked back to town, I was almost convinced he was on the cusp of working out that the money-lender really couldn’t be trusted.\r\n\r\nBut no. That would perhaps be too obvious for Silky's devious mind. \r\n\r\nAnd so, Silky made a stupendous and quite unexpected leap of faith as his thoughts lead him in a different direction. \r\n\r\n\r\nSilky thought about it, and then in a dramatic mis-leap of reasoning, he announced his conclusion that the fucking logger-man (from whom they had rented the wagon) must have organised this. \r\n\r\nYes, the wounded and grieving logger had apparently pulled eight trained and well armed mercenary/bandits out of his ass from the confines of the church and sent them down the road to steal the tax money for himself – of course, it made perfect sense! He probably wanted his logging deeds back too. And so Silky's twisted and unfortunate reasoning went. \r\n\r\n\r\nI hid my amusement and let him talk himself into this as I rolled a few risk rolls for the walk back. Fortunately (or unfortunately) there were still no wolves or bears in the vicinity to take advantage of this easy meal and after a long walk, a night under the stars nestled against the trunk of an ancient Oak – and much grumbling about being abandoned and having not brought any food and water (again, not that he could really chew or swallow with his freshly renovated mouth) – Silky eventually made it back to town. It took him just under 40 hours to get back (including sleeping and general faffing around time).\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had, by this point, worked himself into a righteous and vengeful fury – targeted against the obviously deceitful criminal-mastermind logger-man and his treacherous and deadly, grievously wounded, back stabbing dwarf companion. \r\n\r\n\r\nSilky had had enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was time for him to enact the final chapter of his dastardly plan - a dire and terrible plan he had been working on for about a month now.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so brave reader, If you will humour me, I would like to step back in time with you for a moment. I would like to take you on a journey to a distant forgotten era... about 28 days ago. \r\n\r\nHarp music plays\r\n\r\nScreen blurs to fade.\r\n\r\nFlashback mode engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack at the start of the last session, if you recall, the group had found themselves looking for a lost dog. \r\n\r\nBy itself, this wasn’t a particularly challenging quest, but it lead them to a cabin that would become pivotal in the tragic tale of Jethro Rambola.\r\n\r\nSo... looking for a dog. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that the little trio had found themselves wandering the local countryside, skirting around the perimeter of the town in search of a wayward canine (Silky was helping them in the hope of, should they find the dog, convincing the other two to let him keep it... for dissecting and boxing purposes – just in case you mistakenly thought he had something pleasant in mind).\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had been searching for several hours and by this point they were perhaps a mile from the ‘edge’ of town - wandering through the forest when they came upon a clearing in the woods, with the long since overgrown remnants of a thin trail leading into it. Well, it had once been a clearing. Now it was more of an overgrown patch of brambles amidst the woodland. \r\n\r\nNestled deep within the undergrowth - in the middle of the once-was clearing - stood a dilapidated old cabin. \r\n\r\n\r\nAppearing to be a perfect place for a rogue canine adventurer to have wandered, they quickly decided that the cabin demanded further investigation. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n(GM ~~rubs hands with glee as he~~ prepares to launch the intro for the ‘Horror in The Woods' scenario he had been planning for future use. In truth, I had only intended for this scenario to be used should we ever come back to Oakridge for a second campaign and had only included the cabin now for the sake of completeness and continuity. Really, I just wanted them to know that the cabin was there. I had made a classic GM'ing error and forgotten the adage... 'If you build it, they will come'. Or, less poetically, if players see a building in the woods they will definitely break in and search it).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting through the undergrowth with his trusty axe, Jethro bravely lead the party through the thickets of thorns. (Yay... though I walk through the shadow of the valley of snags and tangles... I will know no fear... for the axe is my shepherd).\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the cabin, the trio did what any self-respecting band of adventuring companions would do in this situation and set about breaking in.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes of sweaty exertion as they noisily levered planking off of one side of the cabin, it turned out that the somewhat rotten door wasn't particularly securely shut anyway.\r\n(Always check doors).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inside of the cabin was layered with cobwebs, dust and grime. It was bare, rotten wood, peppered with hundreds of tiny holes – clear signs of a woodworm infestation. There was a small table, an old bed, a rotten old wooden chest and a small set of shelves. On the walls, beneath the age-accumulated layers of dirt and cobwebs sat the ancient scrawl of the previous occupant. A litany of strange markings (archaic and occult runes to you and I) scraped, branded or stained into the wood. \r\n\r\n\r\nA brief search revealed the place to be fairly empty of loot-able goods. There were stains and dried wax puddles on the table as well as an age worn and faded pentagram carved into its surface and there were some large dark stains on the floor that suggested sacrifices had maybe taken place here at some time, long ago.  \r\n\r\nThe shelves were empty and the wooden chest appeared have been smashed open and left to rot a long time ago – that too being empty. \r\n\r\n\r\nUndeterred, the trio continued searching and finally, covered by decades of accumulated filth, they discovered a trapdoor in the floor that lead to the crawlspace below the cabin. The three argued about who fancied crawling into the filthy (probably snake infested) darkness and eventually Silky volunteered to go down there. \r\n\r\nJethro and JLF weren't keen on the idea of Silky going alone as neither trusted him to reveal whatever he found down there so finally – after much debating – JLF was 'volunteered' to go. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor all his bravado, it seemed Jethro had a deep-seated issue with crawling into dark confined spaces. \r\n\r\nHe was clearly the sensible one. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point I asked the players to make intelligence rolls and JLF got a good pass. With that I told them how they all remembered a tale from their childhoods. A nursery rhyme of sorts about ‘The Witch Who Lived in The Woods’. The tale had the usual childish warnings of not wandering too far into the forest and they remembered that as part of this tale, there was a witch who lived in the woods just outside of town who had a habit of snatching up wayward children and animals. They had all dismissed the tale as they had grown as the usual scaremongering to keep young children well behaved.\r\n\r\n\r\nJLF however remembered hearing a slightly different version. A more realistic version. A version laid bare of the trappings of nursery rhymes and instead rich with savage detail. More like a witness statement! \r\n\r\nOne dark night, his father (before the war [or possibly a happier life elsewhere] claimed him), heavily into his cups, had told young JLF a more detailed version of events that sounded less like the superstitions of country bumpkins and had an unnerving ring of truth. \r\n\r\nThis tale, as told to JLF, had a disconcerting ending. \r\n\r\nHis father had told him of a time when the inhabitants of Oakridge believed themselves to be cursed. Bad crops, still-born cattle, unnaturally bold wolves and missing pets had been but a few of their many burdens. And blame had fallen, as it does, to a strange and unsociable woman who lived just a short way off into the woods. Rumours were abound that the woman in the woods did not age like others around her, instead keeping her youthful looks from season to season. Darker rumours told of strange screams heard in the forest – particularly around solstices, equinoxes, full moons and the like. And the darkest rumours of all told of babies disappearing from their cots and strange part-man-part-beast forms lurking in the shadows on the stormy, fog filled, long winter nights.\r\nHe remembered that towards the end of the tale, the villagers (after an uncharacteristically long and cold winter had killed most of their flocks and a terrible blighted pox had claimed several lives)  – thoroughly scared of this woman – formed a group. \r\nAn angry and scared mob. \r\nThe mob had ruled that clearly the Witch was to blame and had to be dealt with. And so one night they ventured into the woods along that narrow little trail that lead to her cabin and dragged her outside before burning her alive.\r\nThen, in the tale as JLF had been told, as they cast her to the fire and the flames began to caress her youthful flesh, the girl-witch had not screamed. She had not shrieked nor argued nor threatened. She had not made a sound. But, as the flames ravaged her and the smell of burnt flesh and boiling human fat filled the air, her broken and melting face had smiled at the gathered crowd and in unnaturally calm, part other-worldy, almost incorporeal and undeniably sinister voice, she had spoken words that nobody recognised nor understood. As the words danced amongst the flames she had turned her now hateful gaze upon the gathered mob and stared their leader in they eyes.\r\nShe spoke this time in the common tongue, her voice now smoky and rasping like grinding coal, “I will remember you all for your part in this”.\r\nHer stare had only broken when her eyes popped from the boiling juices within. At which point her body turned instantly to ash and collapsed into the fire, smothering the flames in a cloud of choking black dust. \r\n\r\nSpurred on by this grisly story, though JLF chalked most of the tale up to drunken dramatic embellishment on behalf of the storyteller, the trio were eager to check the crawlspace, to see if there was anything of note or value.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when JLF ventured into the crawl space, he was determined to perform a thorough investigation.\n\r\nWhich is how he found the metal case.\n\r\nIt had been buried in the dirt below the house. Nestled in the crawlspace, amongst the spiders and the earwigs. \r\nThere was a snake, but it was sensibly scared of the massive guy holding a lit torch (in a confined space under a wooden building – damn my rolls, the floor above him refused to catch fire. Must have been damp as well as rotten) and so left him well alone. Indeed, their was nothing protecting the case at all. Almost as if it wanted to be found.\r\n\r\n(Remember, all of this was just an intro to a scenario I had planned for potential future use, but as the players insisted on meddling, I figured it was go time. Unfortunately, I hadn't counted on how Silky would react to all of this).\r\n\r\nDespite all of this there was still no dog so, deciding this place is creepy as fuck they left and continued on searching for our canine wanderer. \n\n\r\nLater that night – upon returning to the farm, Jethro and his companions managed to open the case and within they found a collection of parchments and a thin, crudely stitched, leather bound book. The parchments and books were a mix of readable words, unknown words and strange images and glyphs. Many like the strange marks covering the cabin walls.\n\nGrimoires. \n\r\n\r\nSensibly, Jethro opted to lock them in his big wooden chest. \r\n\n\r\nJethro's big wooden chest is an item he had since the game began. Not sure if I mentioned that. It is where he keeps everything that he doesn't carry.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Part 3a...\n\r\n...3b to follow soon. (Much less than 7 months).",

        "text": "I think at least a bit of familiarity with Vampire the Masquerade is needed to get what is happening, but I hope it will be clear anyway.\n\n\nSo, the players are four, plus the DM.\n\n\nDM is \"DM\", I am \"Me\", the other players are a thuggish Lasombra antitribu we just discovered, with plenty of shock, what he was and we will call him \"Lasombra\", a timid Tremere we will call \"Mage\" for the sake of shortness and a pansy Toreador-whatever we will not call at all, since in this he did, like, two things.\n\n\nThe final boss npcs will be called, uh, Boss.\n\n\nAfter a couple of hours of really cool game, we are getting out of an abandoned Luna Park in the undergrounds of Anchorage, after talking with a Dracula animatronics that gave us instructions about the main plot, getting into verbal fights with a lot of generic Lasombras in the mirror gallery and get threatened by a very powerful one to leave after our own Lasombra tried to woo her. Good times.\n\n\nWhile we exit the place, we meet this npcs, a vampire we have been searching for the whole campaing, and around her the whole plot is developed. She starts to talk to us, and like it's nothing, starts to tell us that we have things to do, and describes us how we are going to kill a lot of important figures of our faction.\n\n\nWe, the players, are just now starting to decide if we will play along, when she says:\n\n\n\"Boss\": Stop interrupting me when I talk, because I...\n\n\nAnd then, the Mage literally does that, going on for half a minute explaining how she is right about that and that we will not interrupt her.\n\n\nShe smiles, and goes close to him.\n\n\nAnd there, everything went to shit.\n\n\nThe Lasombra player said to my character \"At me the eyes\".\n\n\nAnd I just literally do that. I clearly say \"I look at you in the eyes.\"\n\n\nNot even a chance to roll the contrasted check to see if I manage to look away. He Dominates me, and I am fucked because this is my first game of Vampire, and I've been depleting my Willpower all the time with no idea how important it was.\n\n\nI have it at 4. I also have Iron Will as a \"feat\", but it's still just a 7 difficulty roll. And I forget the rules and say that the difficulty is just +2 and not +3, because I am fuck.\n\n\nHe gets two successes from rolling no idea how many dices, and tells me to attack.\n\n\nMe, Lasombra and Mage roll the initiative, and Me and Lasombra actually fucking win before the Boss. Toreador just stays in a corner trying to not exist, something he will do for the rest of the session. Not a bad idea.\n\n\nI go first and try to hold down the Boss. I roll 8 dices, not a single one above 6. I miss.\n\n\nIt's Lasombra's turn, he flicks a stake from his pocket and tries to stake the enemy. She gets staked.\n\n\nWe players all look at each other, at least in thought, since it was an online game.\n\n\nThe stake melts, the Boss body melts in a puddle of blood.\n\n\nThe Boss is a Fifth Generation Tzimisce, literally the only vampire that could have pulled off that. Or the DM throwing at us a lot of bullshit about how a vampire of any other clan knows Vicissitute 8.\n\n\nWe all collettively flip our shits for the rest of the turn.\n\n\nNext turn begins. Freenzy check for my character, because he is thirtsy of blood and murderous against what the Lasombra did. I fail it, obviously, and spend Willpower to stay in control for a turn. \n\n\nThe puddle of blood forms a giant figure and takes shape: it's a three meters tall vampiric bat with claws as big as me. We all fail an Intimidation check. Out of game, too.\n\n\nI keep winning the initiative, because I am a Brujah (fast boi) and hold down *the fucking Lasombra to rip his throat on the next action*, since I have a power that lets me attack multiple times in a turn (for who isn't familiar with the system).\n\n\nIt's the Mage turn. Since we all failed the Intimidation check, we start to act like desperate fucks. He rolls 2 dices to hit, and two dices to damage; he runs to the three meters tall eldricth monstrosity and punches it.\n\n\nHe breaks his hand.\n\n\nIt's the Lasombra's turn. He gets a free strenght check against me to free himself (it's how it works, all regular. I even explained the mechanic myself to the group), and he frees himself. All he does is waste his turn anywa, basically, since he summons shadow tentacles to defend us. A level 1 power. I am sure it will be useful.\n\n\nThe last member of our group is doing nothing. He isn't even escaping, and I suppose that's why he will die anyway.\n\n\nThe Boss' turn. She clawes at the Mage. The DM rolls 18 dices to hit. He is hit.\n\n\nAlso, multiple successes to hit add to the next roll to damage, so now the Boss has 5 more dices to damage, to a total of 20. A dice rolling at least 6 is a success. 1's take away successes. 20 dices of damage the Mage can't soak, because you need a special power, or armor, to soak the specific damage the monstruosity was doing to us. \n\n\nIn Vampire, characters have 7 health points.\n\n\nThe Mage gets 3 damages. Out of 20 dices, just a few were above 6, and also a few 1's were rolled.\n\nThe DM admits he didn't even have the stats prepared for this npc.\n\nIt's my bonus action. I run away. I enter frenzy, need blood, and just ran, hoping to escape. Hoping that my companions will last enough that the Boss will not have the time to get me, also.\n\n\nNext turn. The remaining players try their best: the Mage uses a spell to suck the Boss' Blood. Tzimisce blood of that level is acid and inflicts special damage that can't be soaked without special powers. He had no idea.\n\n\nHe rolled 10 dices. For every success, he would have magically sucked 1 point of blood.\n\n\nHe gets 1 success.\n\n\n1 point sucked, every point inflicts 5 dices of damages.\n\n\nDices roll, 2 damages. He is now at -5 out of **7** health points. Still alive.\n\n\nThe session ends. It was just yesterday. Next week we will see.\n\n\nHelp.\n",

But despite one the elemental planes being the most likely destination, Codix and Vikina found themselves stranded in the feywild. \n\nI hadn't had many encounters with fey creatures over the half-year I'd been playing, by this point. Tirkosu was structured around the elemental planes, and it almost felt like there wasn't any room for demiplanes. But than again, Curse of Strahd had been set in one, so I shrugged it off; despite the elemental planes being the main ten (eleven if you include the planelocked shadow realm) several demiplanes must exist \"around\" them. \n\nThe feywild was one instance of such. I considered fey creatures to be akin to elementals, but with a focus on passion, frivolity, hate, and whimsy. In a way, they were \"emotion elementals\". Their plane reflected that in its sparodic bouts of day and night, tangled underground, and delicious food. \n\nThe two mystics wandered through the forest until they came across a band of Satyrs. They were invited to join in a hunt, which they performed admirably on, and partook in the merriment of the evening banquet. They had a wonderful, carefree time; they decided they never wanted to leave the Satyr's grove. \n\nThings got a little bit too merry between them, if you catch my drift. When they'd calmed down by the following morning they decided to find the nearest portal out of the plane. It was having an effect on them similar to the old \"Sirens of Sirenum Scopuli\" trope. They needed to escape, and fast. \n\nI honestly don't remember how they got back. I'm not sure wether a helpful dryad pointed them in the right direction, or whether they asked the Satyrs for help, or if it was sheer luck. What I do remember is Cody getting mauled by a Grick not long before they returned to Tirkosu. It was an encounter far above their level, so I'm surprised they actually managed to drive it off. But Cody was bleeding out, and Viki was all out of psi points. \n\nThankfully they stepped out not far from Appinamopu. The gardens and lower levels of the acropolis-style Tharth had been flooded thanks to the planar unbalance, but the Aasimar were still using the place as a temple. The clerics fixed Cody up and sent them on their way. \n\nThey traveled back to Rahm Oru and were welcomed with thankful tears from Vikina's father. Long absences weren't unusual for her, but after ten months he'd given her up as lost. She introduced Codix, and they got along fine. \n\nCody proposed a couple of months later. Viki accepted; how could she not? They were perfect for each other. I haven't once planned for a character's romantic interest, but this was the epitome of a match meant to be. I'd written off both of them as dead, but the bond they'd developed over their year-long stint in the astral plane proved that the vDM had done the right thing by bringing them back. \n\nThey were married in the autumn, meaning the latter quarter of the year. Tirkosu doesn't experience seasons, so the concept of summer, spring, and all the rest are completely alien to the islanders. They bought a small house in Pernep where the property was cheap. Cody got a sensible job as a logger, while Viki decided to become a chef and subsequently gave several people food poisoning. The Downtime Unearthed Arcana had been released a couple of months back, so I was enjoying using those options to ease the two back into a sense of normality. \n\n* * *\n\nIt was a normality that was never going to last. I'd gotten my hands on the Storm King's Thunder adventure module, and was itching to run it. But giants had never played a big part in the setting, so I decided to switch things up. As I skimmed through the introduction I realised how perfectly the intrigue and subterfuge could be applied to the seelie and unseelie courts. I decided to completely reskin the module to a fey-themed adventure. \n\nIt all started with an attack on Pernep. Codix and Viki woke up to find a band of dryads running around the village. These weren't like the ones the two had seen in the feywild; these were diseased, with a rotting madness in their eyes. They were fast as well; within minutes they'd reached the center of the village and were trying to get at the precious water source. Viki fell behind to take down a few stragglers while Cody headed for the main force. \n\nHe stepped into range and sent a burst of psionic energy through them. I was shocked at how much damage he'd dealt. There were about seven dryads, and every one of them was dropped by single thought. I began to see why the general consensus on the Mystic is that it's overpowered.\n\nThey didn't think much of the attack. Every couple of days or so a bunch of stray Mirlings would try and attack a passing caravan, or an angry elemental would take out his woes on a pride of griffons, so such occurrences weren't unusual. In fact it was a month later that the adventure picked up again, when they happened to be visiting Tapuk. \n\nThe Golath village was still icy in spite of the planar unbalance, due to its high altitude. The rocks beneath the snow had morphed however, creating jagged peaks and craters like nothing before the invasion of Tiamat. The dark wood cabins had been surrounded by a sturdy fence all around the village. It felt strangely Christmassy. \n\nAny sense of it being the season to be jolly was thrown out of the window by Viki who wanted to have a turn in the fight club, that had sprung up in lieu of the popularity garnered by Lundal's old one. She beat the absolute shad out of the first two opponents. The third proved to be a little tougher. \n\nHe was a green, oily-feathered Aaracokra who introduced himself as Tiuk after the fight. He congratulated Vikina on her skill and offered the two a job: several days ago he had discovered the entrance to a huge stronghold in the side of the mountain, hidden from the surface until the changing terrain uncovered it. The portcullis was too heavy to lift, but with Viki's psionic strength he believed she might be able to. \n\nThey agreed to have a look, and journeyed to a point on Mt. Tirkosu about halfway between Tapuk and Hepthurai. On the route they were attacked by ice gremlins, and Tiuk told them of the strange increase in fey activity. A giant marble archway was set into the cliff, marking the entrance to a similarly huge complex inside the mountain. The interior contained statues of all ten Colossi: this was a temple dedicated to the Primordials who created the island.\n\nThings got really interesting when they reached the main shrine. All the elements converged there, similar to how the Worldforge had looked. Written on the wall were instructions on how to use the shrine as an oracle. Through using it they discovered that the fey were running rampant due to the turmoil in the seelie court. Apparently their princess had gone missing, so they were taking advantage of her absence to cause a little chaos. \n\nThe shrine said it could *plane shift* them to the fairy palace for them to deal with the problem directly, but to do so it needed a crystal attuned to the feywild. When asked where they could find one it pointed them to the ice floes off the northern coast, where a band of Satyrs had supposedly made a base.\n\nThey awkwardly thanked the oracle (which didn't reply) and were about to leave for Little Orthraze, when a freaking green dragon swooped down. It seemed surprised to see visitors there, which bought them a couple of free rounds. There was no way they'd be able to take it down. They were level seven, at most. \n\nTiuk told them to run, and they did. The last they saw of the mysterious Aaracokra was him facing off against the scaly monster. \n\n* * *\n\nThey made their way downmountain to the icy seas, and commandeered a boat. They reached the iceberg the shrine had indicated: it was crawling with Satyrs. They had to use every skill in their admittedly extensive arsenal to sneak into their camp. The combat was brutally hard, and Cody was badly injured during the final stretch. He stayed back on point while Viki charged ahead into the final cabin. \n\nShe had an epic shadowy showdown with the chief Satyr and his entourage, lit by a roaring fire. Unfortunately it wasn't epic enough, because she was knocked about viciously. Cody ran in at the last moment and did one of his psychic explosions. That killed off most of the fey including the chief, but the remaining Satyr stabbed Cody in the gut before Viki could take him out. \n\nThe chief had raised the alarm: reinforcements were coming. Vikina grabbed the crystal and hefted Codix onto her shoulders, exiting the camp through a back door. As she staggered away from the hordes across the ice floes carrying her dying husband, she began to cry. Viki never cried. It was a sign of how intense the last couple of days had been. \n\nThey rested up before journeying back to the temple of the Colossi. The dragon was gone, thankfully, leaving them free to access the oracle. True to its word, it plane hopped them to the starlit palace of the seelie court. They introduced themselves to the princess's daughter, Ophelia, who was the temporary head of the court in her mother's absence. She thanked the mystics for coming to her aid and promised them any help they should desire. \n\nThere was a moment where a few of Ophelia's rivals tried to have them \"taken care of\", but they escaped unscathed and the offending parties were incarcerated. Then they were shown an important clue as the the whereabouts of missing princess; a golden ingot marked with a unique seal, found upon the spot which she had disappeared. \n\nViki knew exactly where it had originated from. \n\n* * *\n\nThey hopped back to Tirkosu and headed for Rahm Oru. Airships had seen a resurgence in the decades since the fall of Orthraze, in part thanks to the smaller EPE design perfected by Vanella. One such craft was being used as an upper-class gambling hall for those of high status. Codix and Vikina bluffed their way on board, looking out for any suspicious characters. They waited until the craft had taken off before staging the holdup. \n\nCody interrogated the guest while Viki made sure the crew wouldn't cause any problems. It was easy for a psychic to figure out the guilty party: a rich dustborn mercenary who admitted to having kidnapped the princess. According to his thoughts she being held on Tirkosu, on a boat docked off the shore of the volcano. \n\nThey had what they needed. It was time to leave. \n\nArmed guards burst into the main hall and circled Cody, while the guests fled the room. There must have been close to fifteen of them. This was a well respected business, it was a given that their security was well trained. Any other threat, and they would have taken it down in an instant. But not Codix. \n\nHe pointed two fingers to the room, then flicked them to the left. A wave of psionic energy ripped through the guards' minds. They fell to the polished floor. \n\nCody rejoined Viki (who was busy making the pilot have hallucinations) and they jumped over the side, using telekinesis to avoid going splat. They left behind a captain full of questions, and a room full of dead men. \n\n* * *\n\nThe raid on the boat was a lot tougher than I expected. There were pixies flying all over the place, warped dryads smashing things up, and even a couple of water weirds joining the fray. And in the middle of it all lay princess Titania, kept under both a glass case and a powerful enchantment. \n\nThey broke her out before the fight was over, and let her finish their opponents off. The power she displayed was quite spectacular. She teleported them back to the feywild, and officially thanked them for  their services to the court. \n\nShe also knew who had been behind the kidnapping: the green dragon they'd seen at the temple of the Colossi. Titania was headed to the dragonlands to get her revenge, and the mystics decided to tag along. They weren't going to let Tiuk's death go unpunished. \n\nAfter a short dungeon crawl they faced off against the ancient dragon herself. Cody got hit with a fear attack early on, and spent the entirety of the fight gaping in horror at what they were doing. But that was okay. He'd had his epic moment on the airship; it was time for Viki to shine. \n\nIt came down to the final round: both the dragon and Titania were extremely low on hit points. Vikina had been punching away and flinging fire, and Codix was still in shock. \n\nNow, I will admit that I got the rules slightly wrong at this point. I hadn't read through the grappling section properly, and I didn't realise that you can't grapple something more than one size larger than you. But honestly, that slight rules slip-up made for one of the most epic moments ever. \n\nThe dragon surged forward to deliver a final swipe to the princess. She raises her claws... But never reached her foe. Straining her powerful dragon wings, she looked back to see Viki grappling her by the tail. An insignificant Golath girl, holding back the giant beast with the power of her mind. \n\nTitania zapped the creature with her was, and the fight was over. \n\nAnd that was the end of Storm King's Thunder. Highly edited, and with lots of reskinning, but still SKT. It took less than a week for me to play through it all, thanks to the mobility my setup provides. \n\n* * *\n\nCody and Viki didn't teleport back to  Tirkosu right away. They spent the next twenty four hours digging gold and treasure out of the tree bark that made up the dragon lair. The stash was magnificent, enough to put them among the wealthiest nobles on the island. \n\nThey sold their little house in Pernep and bought some land on the outskirts of the village, upon which they built a grand mansion to live in. It had its own brewery (which Viki was happy about), an impressive library, and most importantly an airship dock. Previously merchants had been forced to dock at the coast and haul their wares inland, so Pernep hadn't been much of hotspot. But thanks to the Lightstep's investment the little village was now much more accessible. \n\nThe princess met with the rest of the remnant of Tirkosu's Tsethem and made a treaty. The fey were ordered back to their own plane, and while there were some stragglers, most of them obeyed. \n\nThe island was at peace once more. \n\n* * *\n\nSomewhere on the Astral Plane, the twisted semi-mechanical clone of Marianne Sterling was grinning. It was a gesture that spelt death for the Tsethem. \n\n* * *\n* * *\n\nSlightly different \"author's note\" this time. ThatOneDudeInThe0 asked me a question and I thought I'd post the answer here for all to see:\n\n\"How do you do modules? You said you did SKT but you didn't say exactly how that worked.\"\n\nMy reply:\n\nGlad my silly ramblings could be of some help. Modules are an interesting one. I'm always exploring new techniques and approaches to solo play, but the method of dealing with solo modules has (for the most part) been similar to thelonecrusader's, [as laid out in his blog post](http://thelonecrusader.com/how-to-play-through-a-published-adventure-on-your-own-without-a-dungeon-master). I read only the briefest overview of the adventure's background, approached each section as it came up to avoid spoilers, and brutally separated player knowledge from character knowledge when conflicts arose between the two.\n\nThat being said, just these last two days I ran my favorite adventurers league module, Mayhem In Earthspur Mines. I basically know the adventure off by heart now, having played through it so many times. So instead of playing it \"straight from the script\", so to speak, I ran it as though it were an ordinary Mythic adventure. MiEM became the guideline for the adventure instead of the rigid railway.\n\nFor example, a short part of the module takes place in a tavern on the way to the mines. There's no combat, you simply pass on by after observing some griffons. Instead of playing this out in due course like I usually do, I instead treated it as a mythic scene and rolled for altercations/interruptions. The scene was altered, and the party ended up embroiled in a bar fight with some salty Elkore. This was completely off script, but the adventure flowed into it smoothly. It felt natural.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is; there are two ways to go about solo modules. You can stick rigidly to the module and read it as you go, or you can read it all beforehand and use it as the \"framework\" of the adventure. Both have pros and cons. In example, for the former playstyle:\n\nPro: You stick to the main adventure. No sidetracks or sudden tangents.\nPro: Little to no prep.\nCon: Very hard to be surprised by narrative points. The adventure overview will likely spoil the best ones.\nCon: Meta knowledge, and the gut-wrenching pain it brings when you force your beloved, oblivious character to walk into the room you know is full of dragons.\nThe framework style has basically the opposite cons/pros. It can completely 180 from the original plot and it means a fair amount of prep (at least each scene/chapter should be read before playing it), but on the plus side it's your game, and thanks to the fickle nature of Mythic you can never be sure your Meta knowledge is correct. Which style you pick basically depends what you want out of the game.\n\nHappy rolling!",
