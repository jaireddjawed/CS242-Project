        "text": "So here's my dealio, in the past 3 months I have been obsessed with listening to Radiohead. When I was growing up still I would constantly listen to \"All I Need\" from their album In Rainbows, and of course everyone knows the song \"Creep\" from Pablo Honey. SOOOO of course when I started getting into their albums more and more, I noticed that everyone was saying how Ok Computer was their best album, and don't get me wrong I'm not hating at all Ok Computer has some BOPS, but is it their best album? Someone on TikTok said that OK Computer was the best album as it had the best vocals from Thom Yorke, and yet I feel like he displays a great range of vocals in most of the albums, sometimes even better than what's in Ok Computer. I personally have an attachment to their albums The Bends as it has my favorite song of all time, so I'm a bit biased. What do you guys think? Are any of their albums that you think are underrated or overappreciated? Thanks for any input, my friends think it's lame that I like Radiohead :)",

But here's the thing - I'm always looking to improve, and I know that honest feedback is the best way to do that.\n\nSo I'm reaching out to this wonderful community to ask for your help. I would love it if you could take a listen to my EP and give me your honest critique. Whether you loved it, hated it, or are somewhere in between, I want to hear your thoughts. I believe that every opinion is valuable, and I'm always looking for ways to grow and improve as an artist.\n\nI'm not just looking for critiques, though - I also want to make some new friends! Music has always been a way for me to connect with people, and I'm hoping that this EP can do the same. So if you listen to my music and want to chat about it, or just want to connect with a fellow music lover, please feel free to reach out.\n\nThank you all in advance for taking the time to listen to my music and share your thoughts.
