We have no family nearby so childcare is a struggle, and the 2 month old will still be being breastfed every couple of hours. 2 of the weddings are a 100+ miles away so would require an overnight stay as well. Even if we could find a whole-day Saturday babysitter, our 2 year old had a complete meltdown last time we tried to leave him in the house with a \"stranger\". \n\nIt's even more frustrating as all 3 of the couples love our 2yo and seem keen to have kids themselves fairly soon.\n\nIf we can't bring our children to your wedding, we can't come. You know we have kids, just don't bother inviting us if they're barred from attending.\n\nOk... Rant over.",

Later that day, when I finally come back, I go and check at the reception to receive my parcel (it showed as delivered, and it can only be so since the driver needs to code to validate it). It turns out they didn't have my parcel available yet. I check 2 hours later, and then the next day, but still nothing. I wait to receive a mail from the University system saying my parcel is ready for collection for the next couple of days but nothing. I start sending more emails to my Uni on saturday, and after some back and forts, I'm told that after the driver received the code, he came back with a huge bag filled with parcels (there are numerous students living here so it's as expected), all but mine.\n\nIt's been one week from waiting and only now I realise I could have gotten my parcel stolen. I chatted with Amazon support, but they cannot do anything about it since the One Time Password was used. What do I do?",
