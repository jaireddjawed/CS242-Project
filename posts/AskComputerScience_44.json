Thus the infix expression (w + x) * (y – z) becomes w x + y z – * in postfix.\n\nA postfix expression can be efficiently evaluated using a stack as follows.\n\nRead the expression from the left to the right.\n\nWhen an operand is encountered, push it on the stack.\n\nWhen an operator is encountered, pop the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation and then push the result.\n\nThere should be exactly one element on the stack at the end and this element is the value of the expression.\n\nFor example, if the expression 20 5 – 3 * is entered, the evaluation should proceed as follows.\n\nSymbol read\n\n20\n\n5\n\n–\n\n3\n\n*\n\nActions taken\n\nPush 20\n\nPush 5\n\nPop 5, Pop 20, Push 20 – 5\n\nPush 3\n\nPop 3, Pop 15, Push 15 * 3\n\nThe result of 45 should then be output.\n\nYour program should ask the user for the name of an input file. The input file will contain postfix expressions one per line. The program should open the file and evaluate the postfix expressions in the file. Your program should give the user the option of writing the results to an output file or to the screen.\n\nYour program should also check the entered postfix expression for validity. A postfix expression is invalid if there is more than one element on the stack at the end of the evaluation or if ever there are not enough operands on the stack when an operation is performed.\n\nE.g. If the input file contained:\n\n20 5 – 3 *\n\n100 50 60 + +\n\n3 4 5 +\n\n3 4 5 +\n\n3 4 + +\n\n3 4 ?\n\nThe output would be:\n\n45\n\n210\n\nToo few operators.\n\nToo few operators.\n\nToo many operators.\n\nIllegal operation\n\nLimit your postfix expression to the arithmetic operations of +, –, *, and / on integer values.",

Algorithm goes like this: first we double length of our numbers, than we do usual multiplication as we did in school with decimals, than we take (doubled length)*2=6 least significant bits.\n\n1. Double lengths:\n\n        101 -&gt; 111101\n        011 -&gt; 000011\n\n2. Do multiplication: `111101 * 000011 = 10110111` (decimal: -73). As we see, this result is wrong.\n\n3. Take 6 least significant bits (drop 2 most significant bits): `10110111 -&gt; 110111` (decimal: -9)\n\nAnd so result became magically right. How this can be explained? I understand that MSB is special and the same rules I've used in school cannot be 100% suitable for 2's complements, but while I fully understand school rules of multiplication, I can't wrap my head around last step of 2's complement multiplication (first two steps I understand).",

Is this hexadecimal? Why the backslash? How does the loaded font file then know to decode \"\\e004\" into a specific icon?\n\nAlso, aren't these icons part of the Unicode charset? If so, why the need for separate font files in the first place? Are the font files using the Unicode charset, and using strange encoding like \"\\e004\" to double translate them, for some reason?",

I find I don't care too much about all the details of programming, I know how to read code and how to fix other peoples mistakes.

From the pumping lemma, we can try to write this string as s=uvxyz and show that no matter how we arrange u, v, x, y, and z, the string is un-pumpable.  Is a legitimate way to attempt this proof to just exhaust all the possibilities of where the substring vxy can be, bearing in mind that the pumping lemma stipulates |vxy|&lt;p?  There are eleven possibilities (the entire substring is in the first sequence of a's, it's partly in the first sequence of a's and partly in the first sequence of b's, entirely in the first sequence of b's, etc.) and, pumping down, they all seem to yield strings like a^m b^n a^p b^p a^p b^p (where at least one of either m or n is not equal to p) or a^p b^p a^m b^p a^p b^p (with m=/=p).  Am I correct in thinking that strings like this can't be written in the form x x x?

In addition to giving precise definitions of these concepts, the course will include a probabilistic approach based on equipartitions. Many of the applications of information will be discussed, including Shannon's basic theorems on channel capacity and related coding theorems. In addition to channels and channel capacity, the course will discuss applications of information theory to mathematics, statistics, and computer science.\"\n\n**Scientific computing** \"Errors. Curve fitting and function approximation, least squares approximation, orthogonal polynomials, trigonometric polynomial approximation. Direct methods for linear equations. Iterative methods for nonlinear equations and systems of nonlinear equations. Interpolation by polynomials and piecewise polynomials. Numerical integration. Single-step and multi-step methods for initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations, variable step size. Current algorithms and software.\"\n\n**Number Theory** \"The subject of number theory is one of the oldest in mathematics. The course will cover some basic material and describe interesting applications. One of the recurrent themes is the realization that mathematics that was developed usually for its own sake, has found applications in many unexpected problems. Some of the topics covered in the class are Pythagorean triples, prime numbers, divisibility and the highest common divisor, linear diophantine equations, congruences, round-robin tournaments and perpetual calendars, multiple functions, perfect numbers, primitive roots, pseudo-random numbers, decimal fractions and continued fractions, quadratic reciprocity.\"\n\nThank you",

        "text": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI just finished Charles Petzold's \"Code\" and found it to be one of the most interesting books on computer technology I've ever come across. Are there equivalent books like this about Operating Systems or the Internet?\n\nSpecifically what I liked about Code: \n\n* The way Petzold covers the entire history of the computer, going back to it's spiritual predecessor, the telegraph key\n\n* The fact that he never oversimplifies concepts to make them more easily understandable. He takes the time to build up the readers' understanding, piece by piece\n\n* There is a perfect amount (IMO) of historical context, including short bios on some of the major pioneers that made breakthroughs along the way and companies that played significant roles in advancing computer technologies\n\n* The storytelling aspect of the book. This is key for me. One of my favorite things about Code was that every section flowed into the next, and the human side of computer technology was never ignored \n\n* a good amount of theory, followed up by how the theory comes into play in the real world, e.g. when he talks about the binary adding machine, and moves into the Altair and other microcomputers\n\nWhat books would guys recommend? I am computer literate, so I don't need books that talk down to me, and I definitely don't want anything that oversimplifies complex concepts. I'm interested in books that take their time, and go down to the bit and switch (heh, bit and switch) level, when necessary, but still make the journey interesting.\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations!",
