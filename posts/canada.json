I've worked since I was around 13 as a labourer with my parent. Then moved into the tech industry after completing my studies. I've seen the struggles that generally most people face when it comes to \"working\". I think it literally all comes down to us not using our natural living spaces, and really crappy infrastructure. \n\nLets say your a labourer. Living in Surrey is extremely expensive, even worse is trying to rent somewhere near downtown. So a lot of the people I knew moved out to Chilliwack. However that puts another issue in place, the infrastructure is decent but still pretty back. The traffic\/gas to drive into the city absolutely kills the moral of most people and puts them into a debt cycle. The skytrain has not been extended yet in the city, which it should be to get more office workers off the street lowering general traffic. How about trains? We have one that goes from Mission to the city, however why haven't we looked into extending it? \n\nThink about it this way. You want to live near the city obviously because it has all the amenities, fun stuff, but most importantly jobs. At the same time commute is horrible everywhere. Even Surrey to Burnaby can suck. \n\nIf we had a larger emphasis on building more infrastructure outwards, im talking all the way to hope; Where it would be feasible for people to literally live in Hope, then train down to a city, I personally believe we would alleviate a lot of the housing issues that happen here. People don't want to move outside the city because commute is horrible, but at the same time can barely afford anything. This is why we see people leaving and going to places like Calgary. \n\nYea yea, we can look at complex \"housing policies\" and \"foreign investments\" but fundamentally, what I think it is, it's just supply and demand. We literally are just using up all the space, prices are skyrocketing, and we try to fix it with \"regulatory\" policies or some other complex bs. \n\nCan anyone explain why we haven't focused much more on infrastructure instead?","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677882615.0},{"title":"Global mining giants are flocking to Manitoba.
