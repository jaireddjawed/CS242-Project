        "text": "This little story is dedicated to those interested in trash picking but afraid to do it for one reason or another. It will be a cheesy post. If you are allergic to this sort of thing, you have been warned :) \n\nSome time ago, I went through a deep depression/mid-life crisis with suicidal thoughts and other unpleasant things. This was a horrible total mental health meltdown type of situation.  I hadn't picked up trash before this time, but I was curious about it. The reasons for not picking up were various and mostly revolved around my fear of being judged by others. I thought that I would look like a strange, crazy person. Looking back at it, it is hard to believe one would feel this way about trash picking, but anxiety and trauma do things to you.\n\nAs I was in the darkest of places mentally, I had no energy left to give any fs about what anyone thought.  I also needed to walk outside for hours because I thought I would go crazy otherwise. So, I grabbed the grabber I had lying around and went trash-picking for the first time in my life. As I was doing it, I felt liberated and alive for the first time in a decade! I was doing what I wanted to do, I did not care about any judgment, and it felt SO SO SO good.\n\nThrough my initial trash-picking experience, I learned what the freedom to be myself feels like. It showed me how good it might feel when you do what you want, even if it is not aligned with \"what I'm supposed to be doing.\"  This experience helped me liberate other areas of my life and pivot my life towards activities that bring me fulfillment. \n\nIf you are curious about trash picking and feel like it would bring you joy but are afraid of judgment, I hear you, and you are not alone. Give this activity a chance, and it will likely bring profound changes to your life. \n\np.s. Since the initial trash-picking episode, this has become my hobby, and I'm actively recruiting friends and family to participate. :)  The only downside of this activity is that I can't pass by a trashed place anymore without noticing what an excellent trash-picking opportunity it is and making plans to clean it up.",

That is, we built a website (and a mobile app coming soon) that helps communities to organize and handle the logistics of litter cleanup.  \n\n\nWe've been working hard on getting the infrastructure set up for almost two years now, and would love to have more people sign up and use the site for their own litter picks. And when you add a pickup event to the site, other people near you who are signed up will get notified so they can join in and help out.  \n\n\nThe site is free to use, and we don't sell info to anyone. We're just trying to help engage and motivate people to clean up the planet. Nearly all of the development on the site has been done by volunteers and we're adding new features all the time.  \n\n\nLet me know what you think and feel free to sign up if you like it!",
