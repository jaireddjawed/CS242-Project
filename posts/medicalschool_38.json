But if anyone can explain how to best set myself up for a good rheumatology program in the future I would appreciate! \n\nSide not: I am a DO and hope there is no bias in rheum for us",

        "text": "Im in my second semester and I’m realizing that I can be on top of things for a short stretch of time, but I can’t do it consistently again and again. We have biweekly tests and you basically have to treat everyday like a test. If you don’t master as much of the lectures on a day given day within that day, the “study debt” will accumulate and it becomes very difficult to make up for lost ground. \n\n\nLast semester, I was consistently able to score as well as I wanted despite doing what I called “strategic cramming” - not mastering the lectures on the same day but instead ramping up my study time everyday up until test day, when I wake up extra early to cram in the last bits. For some reason, I found this easier than being consistent everyday. \n\n\nI just don’t know how my classmates have the stamina to “show up” everyday. Even though mastering lectures every day will result in less total work/stress, I can’t kick myself into shape and immediately get back to it after a test. \n\n\nIt’s possible that it’s a vicious cycle - cramming for test 1 makes me too tired the next day/week to do the lectures for test 2, so I start slacking in the early days before a test. But I’m also worried that I just lack the general stamina. What if I just can’t “show up” everyday? I was able to do it once or twice in the past, but I don’t think I have the time management or stamina to do it indefinitely for the rest of med school and residency.\n\n\nThis does make me wonder if I’m setting myself up for a bad 3rd year/rotations, and subsequently a really subpar residency application. I’m capable of short term work ethic, but not long term. Idk. \n\n\nHow do yall do it? Am I just missing the energy/quick learning ability that the rest of my class has?",

        "text": "So I decided around M2 that I'd like to do radiology - my undergrad degree focused on bioimaging, I (kinda) liked the computer science applications of it, and was looking forward to a field that lets me have a life outside of medicine. I like procedures (not enough to go into Surgery though) and was going to focus on applying to programs with ESIR because I wasn't sure I wanted to commit to IR just yet. Length of residency isn't a concern for me. All my research in med school was related to radiology/imaging.\n\nI'm on my 2nd week of OB-Gyn. So far I've been on Gyn service and Gyn Oncology....and I find myself really enjoying it. The anatomy and methods make sense, I find it satisfying to focus on women's health, and I know that I've always found discussing sexual health and sexuality pretty interesting. I used to hate thinking about the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis but now... It's not that bad??? I like the procedures and how generally the patients are healthier.\n\nI'm going to go on maternal fetal medicine and then labor/delivery in 2 weeks. I'm scared that I'm going to delivery a baby and be like \"This is it. This is what I'm meant to do\". So far the only thing I haven't liked is how long it took to close a myomectomy. There may also be a halo effect because all the attendings and residents have been really cool and nice at the private community hospital I'm rotating at.\n\nI have done zero research into ob/Gyn as a specialty, I never considered it. All my research and activities are radiology related. All my 4th year electives are radiology related (might be hard to switch).\nI'm planning on talking to one of the attendings on the service but I'm just at a loss. I have no idea what I should have been doing to be a competitive applicant, what I should be doing now, or if I just chug along and wait for the afterglow to wear off.\n\nAny advice greatly appreciated.",

I get like 5% of the pimp questions right and I feel like every time I get something wrong I'm just wasting my preceptors time. I don't know how to study for his questions because they're so spontaneous. Theyre fair questions but I am just too dumb to remember. For ex: after seeing a pt with a hernia repair, he asks what is Still disease, or how do they insert the Watchman, tell me about a biloma. Even the questions I do get right , im still wrong. Ive been told every single day just how stupid I am, that Im wasting 60k a year, or that I am going to be a halfass doctor because I want to have a family and get to watch my kids grow. I only have 3 weeks left but I'm starting to question if maybe this man is right? Ive gotten 4 or 5's on all my other rotation but Im praying I pass this one. I study for hours and feel like I know nothing. Lots of the time I just put my head down after some of his comments because I dont want anyone see me crying. I was so enthusiastic the first 2 weeks but now I think my spirit is just tired.\n\nIf theres any attending reading this, I want to say some of us \"dumbasses\" are really trying our best. No one is asking for you to spoon feed us, and I know medicine is practiced different from when you were in school, but please just have a bit of respect for the students. I know this might be a right of passage, but some of us are really struggling with things at home and some of your jabs break our hearts. We look up to you, I look up to my attending. He is such a good surgeon and I know he is yelling at me so I don't make those mistakes when I'm a doc. But man is it starting to get hard to get out of bed on the weekends. (yes I am back in therapy). If anyone is struggling with this, youre not alone.",

However, as I sit here typing this, I feel incredible mental and physical fatigue and feel like I can't do it. I don't know what to do. I have been burned out before in senior year of college but not just from three weeks of studying for a test. I did that before for college physics and I don't see why I can't do it again. I can't drink caffeine because I have really bad reactions to it. \n\nAny tips for getting over this hump? Is it a bad idea to take tonight off and really grind for the next two days?",

        "text": "I’m a third year who has been very depressed on my clinical rotations. I thought it was because third year was supposed to suck, but I am such an empty vessel at this point that I feel like I should reconsider this choice I made. I don’t want to this come across the wrong way, but I just feel like my personality and learning style seems better suited for PA school. It’s an important job that’s different from MD for sure, and I honestly feel like now that I’m interacting daily with MDs and PAs, I find myself envying the PAs/PA students a lot and getting along with them better. I thought I was dead set on wanting to get the last say and sticking with one speciality, but now that I’m in the trenches trying to decide and realizing I have many years of hell ahead of me… I think I made a mistake. I considered other medical fields before going into medical school, I just don’t think I fully understood the difference just from shadowing. I’ve been considering OT too because I love development and the idea of coming up with long-term, hands-on therapy plans (I realize it’s more than this, just summarizing). These are things I thought I could incorporate into being a pediatrician but I think that’s far fetched and unrealistic at this point. And I don’t think I could make it to dev med fellowship right now with my current mental state \n\nSo the question is: what do I do now? I have explored my other speciality options  (pmr, psych, fam med) and I have mental health services already. Nothing seems to be working. Are there transfer programs out there for situations like this? Or do I have to start all over? \nAnd if you’ve done the switch in either direction, do you think the fields are all too similar and that I’m better of just leaving medicine altogether…?",

Could it be that they just forgot to mention COMLEX 2 or are they just soft screening applicants that don’t have USMLE scores?\n\nHow fucked am I?",

It’s great for my mental health and I’m realizing it’s probably what I’m best suited for.  \n\nIf I’m persistent, I can shadow any specialty in the hospital, and I’ve got the free time right now to really take advantage of this and explore.
