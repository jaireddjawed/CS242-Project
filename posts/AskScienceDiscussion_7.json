        "text": "Hi, this isn't looking for medical advice; I'm doing some research for a postapocalyptic story I'm working on. Refeeding syndrome would be at least a concern in an upcoming scene, and it's something I know I need to handle carefully. \n\nIt seems like with famines, wars, and natural disasters, most cases of starvation/malnutrition and recovery (and the risk of refeeding syndrome) would take place outside of well-equipped medical facilities, but everything I've found so far is written in the context of hospitals, and relies on frequent blood tests and IV fluids. \n\nBecause I don't understand the technology involved in checking blood for electrolytes levels etc, I'm not sure how available that capability generally is outside a modern hospital. \n\nA couple articles have discussed a lack of study elsewhere, but I suspect there's a bias in what I'm finding since the well-equipped medical facilities that encounter this syndrome are perhaps better prepared to publish in medical journals. I'm also searching in English which probably cuts off a lot of results from other countries as well. \n\nI'm a complete medical layman, but I'm happy to read anything you can point me to that talks about preventing refeeding syndrome, or diagnosing and treating refeeding syndrome in the field. Similarly happy to hear from anyone with experience or any advice on where else to ask.\n\n(The story context is a soldier trying keep two survivors alive, and to bring them back to health without killing them, while they're stranded in a bunker far from aid. I can justify a bit in medical training/futuristic equipment but him following rough guidelines or experience to prevent it would fit the story better)\n\nThank you very much!",

        "text": "(Anyone who's good with bugs, plz share your knowledge!) ((Originally asked on r/AskScience, got sent her because it's fictional science.))\n\nSpeculative biology/speculative physics\n\nAs the title suggests, I'm wondering about the logistics of super-massive insects. For context, my work of fiction includes many creatures a lot more chonky than they'd be in real life. I originally had the idea of certain city-states employing cavalry in some scenes, but they're on insects rather than horses. Currently the two prime candidates are creatures similar to dragonflies OR moths. Now, I know an insect as big or bigger than a horse is not possible on Earth, due to atmospheric oxygen and insect respiratory systems. I also know once upon a time on earth, creepy crawlies were bigger. A LOT bigger.... Anyway here is where my questions begin.\n\n\n-Humor me for a second, and propose an insect CAN be that big in this world, for whatever reason. Would it be able to breathe? Could it have lungs, or are insects partly classified by the fact that they lack any? \n-Would a moth/d.fly, or any insect really, be suitable as a war beast? My bugs are of course tameable, but how would they fare as war mounts? I know insects are actually quite strong and durable, but it doesn't seem that way to us due to size relativity. I imagine an exoskeleton scaled up to size would be quite tough, along with mandibles, legs, pincers, etc. would all be a lot more potent when scaled for size and strength. How would their wings fare? Insect wings, to me, have always seemed incredibly fail and fragile, but again, this could another issue of size relatively. Most things aren't too tough when pitted against something 10,000 times their weight and height. But scaled for size, would bug wings fare against spears/arrows/blades? \n\n\n -This sort of segways into my next question; about mobility. Many say a big insect would need S-tier wings or muscles to remain mobile, due to exoskeleton weight. For example an ant exoskeleton the size of a human or larger would be quite heavy... so this brings me to the mobility point. How fast would a bug be able to go, if they were plumped up, and made it past the previously mentioned hurdles? Hopefully decently fast, as they're supposed to be used as cavalry and mounts in this scenario. I've seen the fossils of prehistoric dragonflies and the wingspans are really something to behold... how would these wings function, or fare in terms of speed/strength/durability? How maneuverable would these bugs be, in terms of flying low to the ground, *ahem*, bugging enemies, evading arrow fire, etc.? D.flies (and the moths I see in my area) are quite jittery and speedy, especially when chasing prey or flying for their lives. Would this translate at all to becoming chonky and plumped up? Or, as bigger things tend to be slower, would they be unwieldy and clumsy?\n\nI know my work is fairly \"high\" fantasy, and I could dismiss this all with \"it's grand fiction, don't think about too much\". And it's not like I'll be explaining any of this in the work itself, but it's still just stuff I think about. I mean fantasy is plagued with fire breathing creatures, dragons so big their toe is the size of a city block, telepathy and undead, etc... giant buggers is honestly pretty 'realistic' compared to common fantasy tropes. I know full well I could just make my giant insects and say take it or leave it, but the details are very interesting to me. Any input is appreciated :D",

        "text": "Stephen Hawking says that contact with aliens is a bad idea. I heard a quote from someone, I don't know if it was him but it said. \"If the cosmic phone rings, we shouldn't answer\". And we certainly shouldn't be the ones calling (In my opinion). One of the reasons I think this is because, aliens have nothing to gain from making an \"alliance\" . To make an analogy, we are like cows to them (no pun intended), and what do we do to cows?... My second reason is that even if we manage to make an alliance, we always find a way to screw things up. There is a battle going on in Russia and Ukraine right now (as far as I am aware) and endless amounts of political conflicts. And we had racism less than a century ago and still have some today. My point is that we cannot even live with ourselves. We are most certainly not ready to live with a whole other race. How do we know that there will not be any racism towards them? How do we know every single person or superpower on the planet will be onboard with the idea? How do we know some countries will not try to take advantage of the aliens to get ahead of everyone else? There are so many factors and problems with the idea. In my opinion we are simply not ready yet. \n\n*Side note: One possible reason I believe to explain for the Fermi paradox is what I explained above. This shift in motive and conflict.*",

Might it work?\n\nHeld in a stable, geosynchronous orbit, a long tube. I'm talking about the longest it can be without falling out of orbit. The tube is vertical and usually open at top and bottom. It ionizes particles at one end, and uses this to propel ships that speed through it.\n\nThe tube can seal itself as a vacuum, perhaps, in order to be more efficient. But I'm not sure if this stuff be practical.\n\nSecondly, there is a long \"space ramp\" like a hyper loop (so this can be a sealed vacuum as well, to reduce friction) that a ship will go downwards on to pick up speed, then curve up for launch. Imagine a ramp like with one tall end at the top of Mt. Everest, and the thing goes down this ramp, and then once the ship flies off of the other end of the ramp, it can run into this tube, where the ion drive propulses it at higher speeds through orbit.\n\nSo the thing has to hang in the air. But I'm under the impression that the tube having an equal amount of length above and below the stable orbit would help to balance the thing in orbit. Anyway, basically the idea is that: you drive through a propulsion tube, but also use gravity as an accelerant.\n\nIs this similar to any designs that have been thought up before? I would imagine these portal like objects could perhaps hang in geosynchronous orbit near several planets or moons, or whatever, and so you could use gravitational forces to slingshot your ship while adding acceleration at every point. What's more, is that this adds to space acceleration.\n\nI mean it's pretty clearly heavily influenced by existing science fiction. But I've read ships use ion drives to get through space; and I have read about magnetohydrodynamic drives in boats. \n\nI'm just wondering if this is a feasible project to consider for somewhat realistic space science fiction....

The first variant is termed dominant and the second recessive. (...)  If an individual has two versions of a gene, then the gene that is frequently observed in further generations is considered \"dominant\".\"\n\nSo an *AA* and *Aa* individual exhibit the same *A* phenotype, because the *A* allele is dominant over the *a* allele. Only *aa* individuals exhibit the different *a* phenotype. That works well when 100% percent of *AA* and *Aa* individuals show the *A* phenotype, but that's not always the case.\n\n\"**Penetrance** in genetics is the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant (or allele) of a gene (the genotype) that also express an associated trait (the phenotype).\"\n\nThat means that sometimes an individual with the *A* gene (either *AA* or *Aa*) can have the *a* phenotype*.* Maybe 99% of those individuals have the *A* phenotype as expected, maybe 90%, maybe 75%.\n\nMy question is: when does that allele simply stop being dominant? If an *Aa* individual can have both the *A* or *a* phenotype, does it make sense to call *A* dominant over *a*? It must be above 50%, but when?\n\nAlso, does anyone have any suggested materials for me to read on penetrance?\n\nThanks!",

The problem is that the energy transfer in the heat sink is only so much; since air has a much smaller thermal mass as well as specific heat, it will reach temperature very quickly before the liquid cools. When the still warm liquid cycles back, the temperature difference between it and the components are small thereby reducing the rate of heat exchange. This should be a significant factor despite the fact that liquids have a higher thermal mass and specific heat.",

        "text": "Let's say I have a fairly weird plasma consisting of dust grains which are mildly positively charged, and electrons. The plasma is exposed to UV light, so the dust maintains a positive charge. I would like to add kinetic energy to the dust grains. Is there an effective (and relatively energy efficient) way to do this?\n\nMy first thought would be to just use a strong oscillating E field. Although that would couple with the charged dust grains and be able to accelerate them, it would couple much much more strongly to the electrons and so I think this would end up depositing way more energy into the electrons rather than the massive dust grains. A more complicated idea I had was this:\n\nSet up oppositely charged parallel plates made of wire mesh (so particles can slip through the plates). Let's say the plates create an E field pointing down. Then set up a perpendicular B field in the area within the plates; say the B field points right. The electrons will have a much smaller gyro radius, so rather than be accelerated across the full gap between the charged plates they'll orbit cycloidally, experiencing E x B drift and gaining no net energy. The dust, on the other hand, will have a gigantic gyroradius, much larger than the scale of the charging plates, so they'll be accelerated across the full parallel plate gap and escape out the bottom face of the parallel plate mesh with more kinetic energy.\n\nMy questions are: 1. Would this work to selectively add kinetic energy to the dust grains? 2. Is there a name for this technique? 3. Is there a better way to do it?\n\nAnd just for the sake of getting some sense of scale: I'll assume my dust grains are 10 microns in radius, charged to +3 Volts, and have a density of 3500 kg/m\\^3. That would give them a charge to mass ratio of 2.4e-4 C/kg, compared to electrons which have a ratio of 1.8e11 C/kg.",

        "text": " Ok, just hear me out alright.\n\nI understand that this some sort of fever dream thought, but it's actually interesting to think about (not being a scientist and probably being ignorant about the majority of physics laws, naturally).\n\nSay - there is Titan. It has gravity of 0.138 g, aka about 14% of Earth's. That we can't change, but we theoretically still can walk on it, even though it is lighter than the Moon (83,5% of Moon's gravity). Walking won't be easy though - the hopping technique would be much easier and faster, if we stay in realm of *moving-on-your-feet*.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nIf we will just ignore the little studied effects of low, but not-zero gravity on human body, the real difference is just that on the Titan human will be roughly 14% lighter than on Earth. But what if we will wear some kind of specially designed suit, or rather boots, that will artificially increase the weight? Let's assume there is a technology than can change the power that exoskeleton-esque pair of boots pulls the wearer down with a remote - like, if the person's weight on Titan is 28 pounds, they can move a certain slider to add 172 pounds more, making their weight identical to the Earth's. The question is - **will it allow to walk around on Titan with the same speed and effort that on Earth?** It's clear that this will influence only the strength of vertical pull, and your arms, for instance, will probably still \"flow too far\" if moved fast enough; and the full-on suit that has this technology perhaps would be a smarter decision, because the additional weight would distribute itself all over the body and not only on the feet... But anyway, here it is.\n\nBasically - I'm just asking about artificial gravity suit the way I understand it.\n\nUpd. I just learned about the V2Suit. This is quite related to the topic, but it is still just one variant.",

        "text": "Right so let us say that Venus during the space race was habitable. With average temperatures of around 57 degrees celcius. An exaggerated seasonal transition with winters at the poles enjoying 52.4C, and the worst temperatures being about 61.7C. It has a global ocean system much like earth, albeit about 1.25 times as salty, and a plate tectonic system however its continents are laid out more similar to Earth during the early protozoeic however large much like the cambrian period. An atmospheric pressure around 1.6 times that of the earth's and a 31.2 hour day/night. It's atmospheric composition in scenario 1 being still alien but more like that of the Cretacious with more proportioned amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Let's say 32% more oxygen than the Earth, and 4x as much CO2 compared to the earth, almost double the amount of Argon and 8x the Ozone.   \n\n\nIn this scenario, Venus has no intelligent life, but definitely a native biosphere accustomed to the planet.   \n\n\nSo still hellish but definitely more habitable than present-day Venus. Now down to the hypothetical, during the Cold War, with Venus being this much more hospitable, how likely would Venus of been colonized under these parameters successfully, by whom, and could we of been a bi-planetary species had Venus of been like this? If so, what would you imagine life would be like for these hypothetical Venusian based Humans?",

        "text": "Historically, women were considered subordinate to men (most of history, at least). Many religions argue that \" It's the rule of nature\" and women were of lower caliber (there remain religions that consider women to be symbols of prosperity, wealth, and robustness, but the women continued to be subjected to gender hierarchy). I recently read an article that stated that women were capable of managing and initiating social cooperation more efficiently compared to men (scientists believe that Sapiens superseded other primitive human species because of their ability to cooperate in masses). Biologically speaking, although an average woman is physically smaller compared to a man, it has been proven that they have a high level of pain endurance and a longer lifespan. I have always been intrigued as to why women are thought to be subordinate to men. I would like to hear everyone's opinions! \nThanks!",

        "text": "This is something I've always wondered about these big space telescopes. For these bleeding-edge one-off devices, I imagine most of the cost has to be in the design process itself, plus rigorous testing to prove the concept. For each part and the whole assembly, a lot of institutional knowledge must be built up, teams developed and honed, etc. \n\nConsidering the demand for time on a telescope like Webb, the idea of just making a few more of them seems a tempting idea. Since we already know how to do it, and since we've built up all the skills and knowledge to produce a JSWT-style telescope, why stop at just one? Why not make multiple copies of the same telescope? I think hundreds would likely be excessive, but maybe half a dozen would be in order?\n\nAnyway, I suppose my real questions relate to practicality. Obviously we *can* build another JWST. The question is, should we? Towards that I have a few sub-questions:\n\n1) Cost. Is my assumption of the cost savings reasonable? Wikipedia says the thing, with all the cost overruns, cost about $10 billion. If building a new one would cost say, \"just\" a few hundred million, then cranking a few out seems reasonable. If a second would cost $7 billion, then designing a new telescope from scratch seems like a better option.\n\n2) Time. How quickly could we make a second JWST? Again, I'm talking about literal copies here, the same design for everything, just completing the manufacturing process a second time. The original took 23 years. Could we do it in just one or two?\n\n3) Would such a thing be worth it? Would it be better to make multiple copies of cheaper JWST's, or use those funds to pay for missions optimized for other targets?",

        "text": "I was curious if we have a theory/hypothesis on why music is, quite literally, transcendental of an experience for our minds.\n\nWhy the hell would we evolve to experience noise as anything beyond a communication technique and a survival mechanism.\n\nI do have a basic theory on maybe how it starts, but was wondering; why is this a thing?\n\nBut as far as my assumption - My guess is its linked to being in utero, the only sound we likely hear, starting at about 4 1/2 months, infants gain the ability to hear.   So that leaves an infant with its only sense being occupied by a steady rhythm and beat, the mother's heart.  Then as we grow, we are able to enjoy more complex rhythm and sounds.\n\nThats my guess on it, anyway.  Was curious to get other people who know more about it than I do, to explain.\n\nThanks for your time",

I know the atmosphere on Mars is basically a vacuum, so I am guessing there isn't enough of anything floating around to actually inhale and exhale at all.\n\nBasically I am following this line of questioning: How much pressure do you need to be able to breathe? How much oxygen do you need to add to raise the air pressure that much? We've increased the air pressure, but is there enough Oxygen to sustain a person? If not, then how much more Oxygen do we need and what is the resulting air pressure?\n\nI seem to have been thinking about this a lot recently but I don't know how to figure out the answer. I'm completely ignoring anything else needed for survival, like temperature and other stuff that might kill you unless the pressure were higher. Let's imagine a Mars colonist experiences an accident, maybe the they survive for 5 minutes instead of 2 minutes long enough to be rescued.",
