        "text": "McConnell: The cCaptain. Steward of the state of ship. Wants to cCrash everything besides cCorporate power. Reptilian perspecCtive on organicC lifeforms, thus SocCially Darwinism in all policCy. Willing to let everyone drown, giving rise to a polluted turtle cCivilization after cCataclysmic cClimate cChange ocCurs.  cControls a flotilla of trans-ocCeanic drug smuggling and the Transportation SecCretary to boot. Grand cCycClops of the cCthulic cCrypt.\n\n\n\nGrassley: the Gravedigger, the grass-man trafficks in knowing where the bodies were buried, all in the name of justice.  Natural performer around c-span cameras, a script, and white-crime criminals. Last of the ancién lineage of republicanism as embodied in the post-bellum midwestern Republican Party. Gatekeeper and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is basically the mod and deserves our distain.\n\n\n\nHatch: the Insider. Conduit, medium, the back door for the oligarchy. Closeted Christian theocrat amongst a demonic cabal. As president pro tempore, he officially serves as both senate crypt-keeper and gate-keeper. Has preserved and gleefully resurrected the name Robert Bork and continues to dishonor Anita Hill. Hatch himself took the escape hatch out of the next congress and let Mitt into the senate via trap door. Gives under-handed and unwelcome compliments on attractiveness.\n\n\n\nCruz: The Professor. Debate, dogma, demagoguery, dialectics and the Dark Arts. This vampire strikes for the heart by actually debating the socialist menace. Secretly stashes a second face under his turban- which is human skin and hair, and whose mouth hides tictac-sized mouth stones. Today’s testimony boiled down to a narcissist larping with another psychopath before the judiciary committee.  Progeny of the greatest propagandist of the deed. \n\n\n\nSasse: The Scout. Tries the do the right thing, which is the definition of the banality of evil, as conservative orthodoxy is brutal exploitation. Never Trump Conservative who would never face trump in a head-to-head competition besides tying knots and sassy name-calling. Because an evil failson said he should be president he can smell power. \n\nCrapo: The Shit-head. Chills on the senate hot couch in the coat closet where the ghouls literally plot out their schemes. Doesn’t care. Shot a bowel movement all over the gun control movement. \n\n\n\nCornyn: The Cowboy. Literally the WHIP of the majority. Wannabe Texan Law Man and rumored replacement to Sandra Day O’Connor, so he can relate to Kavanaugh’s failings. Like Kavanaugh is a Bush clan operative. Probably would defend slavery in another status quo. Like so many republicans he represents the carpet-baggers on the dole of big multinationals. Lieutenant to McDonald’s and Mcconnell.\n\n\n\nTillis: The Mole. Defender of Mueller. This North Carolinian is the southern end of the Underground Railroad shuttling evidence to Southern district court of New York. Like Richard Burr, he is the far right wing of the resistance, thus an authoritarian opposed to fascist competition. Had to look him up. This shit is borin’, yo.\n\n\n\nMike Lee: the Minuteman.  zealously takes a hatchet to spending bills. Wages guerrilla warfare in the congress on behalf of ultra-wealthy ultra-nationalists. \n\n\n\n\nFlake:  The Coward. Flakes on all his friends and shirks his obligations before the law. He was a fraud and didn’t really like being a senator; and is really a bystander to a criminal conspiracy and can only think of running away. Wants same horrible policies but doesn’t want to be the pawn saying aye. Thinks he’s more like an onion, he has layers. Still an ogre.\n\n\n\n\nGraham: The Thespian. Has been playing make-believe his whole life. Harlot bride to the American Empire. Cassandra of the military-intelligence communities. Grand-stands with the best of the them, reliably performs a theatrical flourish like casting a plague on Democrats. His soft voice quivers before his Protestant God, knowing himself to be an abomination. \n\n\nKennedy: the Preacher. Somehow not the worst Kennedy. Attempted the draw the nominee into legal jeopardy with God, as He has likely seen evidence of perjury. Delivered the closing sermon of the Kavanaugh testimony to collectively absolve the sins of the running class before the nation. \n\n\n",
