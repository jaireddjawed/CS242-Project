DiIulio who claimed that  (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/politics/killing-on-bus-recalls-superpredator-threat-of-90s.html?_r=0) there was a growing group of \"superpredators\" or young people who had lost their conscience and empathy and were willing to commit violent acts remorselessly, and these people would lead to a rise in violent crime.\n\nMy question is how well accepted was this in the social science world? No doubt it was popular in the media with discussions of crime and youth and in part captured public fears because it played on existing white racial anxiety. But how much did academic social scientists take these theories seriously? Was there something of consensus that this was driving crime? Or was the view widely denounced by serious scholars and just popular in the media?",

Or is it because police tend to patrol the poorer areas most often, and those areas are where black people are more likely to live, due to a socioeconomic status that has propagated throughout the generations?\n",

My research questions are as follows:  \n\n* SI: \"How do gender roles and expectations affect the workplace environment?\".  \n\n* SSP: \"How do women internalize their prescribed roles in the workplace?\", \"When women take the same action as men, how are their actions viewed differently than that of the man.\" and \"How do women, especially while in the workplace change their behavior based on how their actions and attitudes expect to be interpreted?\".  \n\n* Group Processes: \"How is the group dynamic formed when you have a mixed gender group?\", \"What roles are generally assumed by women when working a mixed gender group\", \"How successfully do groups work together while under different gender-based power structures\"  \n\nDo these research questions fit their perspectives appropriately?

In Greece, Golden Dawn can't seem to pass 10% in the polls. In Turkey, the far right seems to have collapsed due to the AKP's rise.\n\nAs you can see, I could pinpoint at specific reasons in each nation as to why the far right is not on the rise in these country. But I'm curious as to why this entire part of the world is not as conducive to these radical politics as in regions to the North.

That the lower the position, the less people come out to vote for it.\n\n3. That the local level positions are worth voting for.\n\nIf anyone can also confirm or disprove these assumptions, that would be helpful as well.\n\nAnyway, it seems to me, based on my own personal experience, that there is relatively high participation when voting for president than when voting for lower levels of government. However, it seems that voting for your state representative, governor, and all the way down to mayor, would at least be more effective for changing one's immediate community (e.g. the money the school district depends on who is elected on the state level, rather than who is elected on the federal level). Is there a psychological factor where people are reluctant to vote in their more immediate community because they feel more empowered when voting for the country as a whole, or is there some other factors that lead to less people voting for lower levels of government?",

        "text": "I'm basically copypasting this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/2f0fra/how_did_the_population_of_the_usa_grow_so_fast/\n\nbecause there is no answer to that question.\n\n______\n\nAfter having recently seen the new UN figures of population predictions up to the year 2100 (in which the population of most developed countries are expected to remain relatively stable, likely as a result of factors such as a declining birth rate and possibly difficulty in predicting future immigration rates etc.), I began to wonder how this compared to the demographic history of the USA, and at what stage it surpassed that of its creator nation. Needless to say, I was quite surprised by the figures.\n\nAs far back as the 1830's, the USA had surpassed the population of England (~12.8 million to ~12.1 million), with the US population reaching England's current population of ~53 million in the 1880's, reaching over 100 million by the 1920's, doubling to 200 million by the 1970's and increasing to 300 million in the 2010's, 40 years later.\n\nLooking at the figures, it seems almost surreal - jumps of 12 million people per decade, 15 million people etc., and, even recently, a population jump of over 20 million people between the 2000's and 2010's. Albeit, perhaps this is misleading - as a proportion of the current population, a growth of 20 million may simply be the norm for a country of the US' current population size.\n\nHowever, although the US' net migration rate is 40th in the world and below a number of other Western nations, 2.45 per thousand out of a population of over 300 million is huge, placing the US foreign-born population at over quadruple the size of the country with the second highest foreign-born population, Russia.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm interested to why this is the case that the USA has so rapidly risen (and continues to rise) above that of other countries. My first assumption would have been that of the \"American Dream\" image presented to others, but this only entered into mainstream use from 1931 onwards, and (in contemporary times) certainly hasn't been without criticism when looking at indices of inequality and social mobility of America compared to other nations.\n\nLooking at its northern neighbour (which has a reputation for being \"multicultural\"), I was interested to see that (although very recent in terms of legislation) the 1982 Constitution Act enshrining multiculturalism as a Canadian value, although leading to a doubling of what the immigration rate was in the years prior to its introduction, had simultaneously had (in contrast to what we had seen in the American example) no discernible effect on the population growth of the Canadian population. Whereas America had been so successful in attracting the \"tired, poor and huddled masses\", why has a country such as Canada not been equally as successful as of yet? The argument could be made that Canada's official acceptance of multiculturalism has only been recent, and thus it's absurd to expect miracles in such a short period of time; however, when I look at the American example, it persuades me that such expectations don't seem absurd at all. Nonetheless, even with the official acknowledgement of Canada as a multicultural nation, the UN population predictions don't suggest any phenomenal change - and, with Canadian immigration policy controlling and capping the number of people who can migrate per year (as well as who, specifically, can immigrate to the country, with professional categories) as with every other country, the belief that the Canadian population won't rapidly inflate like the US population did is entirely justified.\n",

I'm curious if this is reflected in the data or merely anecdotal. If there even is data that could be used to answer the question; I can see a host of issues in doing so. But I figured it ouldn't hurt to ask.",

        "text": "So you hear from time to time people saying: \n\"Racism is such a overused word that it's more or less started to become meaningless.\"\n\nSo whether it's true or not I don't care about. I'm interested when and how that happens. Is there a term for the process? \n\nMaybe I should illustrate by an example: \n\nYou often hear social justice people use the term \"white supremacy\" in present debates. To me \"white supremacy\" conjurs up mostly images of klan rallies and nazis and shouldn't be used in this manner. Not because i'm unable to understand the context in which they use it but because most people don't. \nFor most people \"white supremacy\" means just klan rallies and nazis. But when social justice people use the term in order to describe why the Academy awards have few black actors I think there is a sizeable chunk of people who think:\n\n-\"Jeeez you people are relentless and unpleasable.\" \n\nThis in turn make people go: \n\n-\"Well I guess everything is racist nowadays and you can't say nothing.\"\n\nBasically, the term \"white supremacy\" that was being used to describe really extreme forms of racism is now used to describe clearly milder forms of racism. It's basically very hyperbolic. Because of this I think, if it's being used as it's being used right now by social justice people, that it will loose alot of it's weight and that scares the crap out of me. \nIf the social stigma of being called a racist, and today, even a white supremacist then, well, you do the math.
