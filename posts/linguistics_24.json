The ideas seemed too simple even though the theory - of linguistic relativism and determinism - is far from simple. I googled the writer, and he has no background in linguistics whatsoever. As I am just only getting into this idea of linguistic relativism, I was wondering if you guys agree with me that the arguments seem juvenile.  I haven't found any reviews yet. I'm curious what you guys think!",

        "text": "I know they technically mean the same thing at present, and the former is used more often. But I just want to know how \"pangalan\" came to be and how it became more widespread when \"ngalan\" is already a perfect word to mean \"name\"?\n\nThe common translation for \"What is your name?” is \"Ano ang pangalan mo?. But it is also equally valid to translate it as “Ano ang ngalan mo” or \"Ano ang iyong ngalan?” (which I often hear in Filipino period dramas). So I wonder, what does the prefix “pa-“ indicate?\n\nA related word is the Filipino word for “noun”, which is “pangngalan”. Its literal meaning is clearer since the prefix “pang-“ means “for” or “used for”. Since “ngalan” means “name”, the literal translation of “pangngalan” is “for naming”, which is the function of nouns.\n\nI am thinking that \"pangalan\" is closer to \"how you are called\", which is roughly equivalent to Spanish “se llama\". Am I correct though?",

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

        "text": "In many languages, such as Polish, Russian, and Hungarian, when a voiceless obstruent comes in contact with a voiced obstruents, there is voicing assimilation so the two obstruents are pronounced with the same voicing.\n\nHowever, I noticed the other day that English seems to only follow this trend for the suffixes -s (ex. plural) and -ed (ex. past tense), but not much elsewhere. If the two obstruents cross a syllable and/or morpheme boundary (other than the suffixes mentioned above), there appears to never be voicing assimilation. The following words are pronounced without voicing assimilation:\n\n\\- su**bt**ract /sʌ**b.t**ɹækt/\n\n\\- u**pd**ate /ʌ**p.d**eɪt/\n\n\\- lan**ds**cape /læn**d.s**keɪp/\n\nI remember reading about how English voiced plosives are not actually voiced, but unaspirated voiceless, somewhere. I wonder if that's the reason why there is no voicing assimilation.\n\nA related phenomenon I noticed is that \\[v\\] tends to cross-linguistically keep its voicing and not devoice adjacent voiceless obstruents. I observed:\n\n\\- Romanian *a****cv****atic* /a**k.v**a.tik/ (aquatic)\n\n\\- German ***Qu****arz* /**kv**a:ʁts/ (quartz)\n\n\\- Swedish ***sv****enska* /**sv**ɛnska/ (Swedish language)\n\n\\- Russian **тв**арь /**tv**arʲ/ (creature)\n\nAnd somehow it's always \\[v\\] with this property, not any other obstruent, from what I observed so far.\n\nSo, to summarize, my 2 questions for this post are:\n\n(1) Why does English not have voicing assimilation for obstruents, in general?\n\n(2) Why is \\[v\\] especially resistant against voicing assimilation cross-lingustically?\n\nThank you for reading and answering.

When I Googled it I got a lot of questionable, religiously-motivated folk explanations and I found it hard to find what I needed. I have no preference necessarily for very in-depth historical etymology, just what these morphemes came from and what productive role they ended up playing at the time of the transition from 2 to 3 consonant roots.",

        "text": "I'm a member of /r/AskEurope, and every so often we have questions related to languages and language varieties. In all of them, there's at least one or two French and Italian redditors who talk about what most linguists who work in that specific field consider to be languages, or treat as such. \n\nI'll give just one example - not the 10 or so threads that I can recall reading in that subreddit in my time there. Just today there was a thread called  Is there a dialect of your language that is very difficult to understand for other speakers of the language?. The OP made it quite clear what they were after, different varieties of the same language:\n\n&gt;Back when I was 6, I was a fairly stupid kid stuck on a back window of a 1994 Toyota Corolla, thinking \"ah, so Spaniards only speak Spanish, French speak French, Hungarians Hungarian – it is only Croats who have so many different ways of speaking!!!! I love it!!!\".\n\n&gt;Fast forward 16 (sheeesh, time flies) years after that, I have only grasped how different languages are. And how vastly different dialects can be. For example, Croatia has this specific type of dialect called \"bednjanski govor\", which comes from a village of Bednja, and is very different and difficult to understand for a good part of the Croatian folk. Slovenia has Prekmurje Slovene, which was painfully difficult to understand when I came to Slovenia for the first time. My father, a fluent speaker of German language says that he cannot understand his Swiss colleagues.\n\n&gt;How's the situation like in Europe? Are there any regions that have a specifically heavy dialect difficult to understand for other speakers of the language?\n\nHere's a French redditor with this response:\n\n&gt;Nobody can understand people speaking Basque language. Breton is not understandable either. Good luck understanding Corsican. Alsatian is basically a German dialect. And if you extend to Fench overseas region, Mayotte's Shimaoré is absolutely not understandable. , And the different creoles from Réunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe are probably a 20% understandable.\n\nHere's another French redditor with this response:\n\n&gt;Definitely yes, in France we have many very different dialects too, someone speaking french will absolutely not understand someone speaking Alsacian, the dialect from the Alsace region of France (the dialect is actually much closer from German than french, but also not really understandable to most Germans). And as someone from Alsace, I can understand people from the south of Alsace but it’s a bit harder for me to understand people from the north of the region because the accent and some words are very different.\n\n&gt;And this is just one example in France because many regions have dialects of course.\n\nI don't think there's any serious linguist who would claim Basque, Breton, Corsican, Alsatian, Réunion Creole etc to be dialects of the French language. This suggests to me that the way French and Italian people use the word 'dialect' is very different from the definition of dialect I am familiar with.\n\nWhat do French and Italian people mean when they say 'dialect'?",

However, these kinds of texts focus on their phonological evolution and not on their morphological evolution.\n\nI was hoping someone in this sub might know more about the evolution of the copula or could point me to sources.
