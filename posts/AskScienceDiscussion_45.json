Sodium chloride has a very sharp and unpleasant sting when you have too much of it, where as ammonium chloride has more of a smooth taste. And looking around online it seems to be a common theme, that it's a bit like salt but not really.",

        "text": "So let's take the example of plants moving towards sun(caled photomorphism). There are multiple levels of sceintific analysis to this. Biologically/evolutinarly, the plants grow toward the sun because plants which grow toward the sun thrive and dominate plants that do not.\n\nFor the biochemistry of it, we can see that, specifically, the hormone \"auxin\"(source: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130528105946.htm) causes this phenomenon. Tying back to biology, we can assume this was likely a mutation which, when obtained, caused dominance of the plants that had it. Over time, almost every plant developed this hormone naturally and now have the ability to grow toward the sun. The ability for the trait to become heritable is caused by DNA. Through biology, you could not the exact chromosome which it is dependent on. This study did a \"molecular analysis\" of the gene which causes auxin, found on chromosome 4 of Arabidopsis(a small flowering plant native to Eurasia and Africa).\n\nThe summary of their findings(just click the link, its too long to copy) basically shows the exact number of amino acids(and supposedly the 'class' of amino acid) present on this DNA. So you can now say that, on this leve, plants grow toward the sun because of the amino acids present on chromosome 4(in this plant's case) which is passed through DNA. Evolution takes over, now all plants have it.\n\nBut what if we want to go deeper. This is where it starts to get murky for me. Supposedly a scientist could further identify these amino acids based on their exact elements, and then via that, to their exact number of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Correct me if I am wrong(from my knowledge) but we know the exact number of atoms, chargres, etc for each element. So we could say that this orginization of atoms has caused plants to grow close to the son. But, supposedly, as the most 'ground level' law physics shoudl be able to explain even more of the picture. \"Why\": did the laws of gravity, energy, etc. play on these atoms in such a way to allow plants to grow closer to the sun?\n\nYou can go another level with this as well(though I won't go all the way through it like the last example). What about the planetary physics? Are those forces that are at play in allowing plants to grow closer to the sun?\n\nIs physics controlled by biology, the other way around? Is this what we need a \"theory of everything\" to explain. It seems like the levels of analysis right now are like a big puzzle and we are just missing the glue to hold it together. Obviously, advancements in some parts of the puzzles do connect somehow(through years of testing, philosophy, etc.) this is evident through microprocessors and the other heights of our technological achievements. But we are obviously still missing something in our explanation. Where exactly is this break?",

At higher doses Mckenna hypothesized it would foster arousal and orgy. Anecdotally Mckenna attributes larger doses to the creation of art, music, language, and a more advanced culture in general.\n\nUnfortunately, only a small group of people seem to talk about this hypothesis, and very few skeptics participate.
