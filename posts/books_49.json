        "text": "I was naively searching for a book on attractiveness and understanding different female characters, but ended up with this disturbing book and I can't even sleep.  \n\n\nMy general mood since then became toxic, the feeling that I am now surrounded with manipulatives people who try to take advantage of me just makes me scared, and it's also not how I approach life, instead I always assume the good in other people.   \n\n\nMy 2 main issues after reading few pages is \"taking credit of others work\" which is horribly unethical and selfish, instead I believe it should be worded as putting effort to make your work shine or more representable.   \n\n\nMy 2nd issue is putting all the managers in one pot, that they are assholes with big egos that need to be fed in order to grow, while ignoring that there are good examples out there who actually wants you to grow and be a better version of you. Of course, no manager wants his inferior to have power over him, but you can grow anyways in your company by good means such as making friends and representing your skills at key moments and eventually you will be more in demand. Also another argument to this, that if your manager is a guy who doesn't want you to grow, you can simply leave the company there are tons of jobs nowadays.   \n\n\nWhile I acknowledge that some examples of these people exist in real life. My only problem that the book suggests people to do that in order to be in power.   \n\n\nTLDR; So these were my takeaways about the 48 laws of power book, now I need a book that would restore my faith in humanity and help me find the good values one more time",

        "text": "Recently I bought a book second-hand from a store off of Amazon UK, not Amazon it's self but a store selling on it.\n\nI was excited to read it, the condition of it admittedly wasn't great, there were stains on some pages and generally the book was dinged up fairly bad, but when I was reading it I found something poking out of the pages. I assumed it was a page that tore a bit, unsurprising for the condition it's in, but I found a bookmark there.\n\nWell you might be asking, \"why am you getting so upset over a bookmark?\" well this bookmark seems to be fairly personal. First of all it is literally just a piece of laminated paper, in which the paper is not even at all with the laminate, which is pretty cute. Obviously homemade. The paper it's self seems to brown at the top and whiten at the bottom, maybe it's burnt? It's like a gradient but it seems unnatural. On it there is writings of various names \"Nollie!\" \"Sienna!\" and various other names, as well as a drawing of a cat, certainly not professional but still very cute, perhaps drawn by a kid.\n\nThe cat has a line pointing to it saying Kitten, I don't know if that's the name of the cat or they're just generally pointing out it's a Kitten. Underneath is written \"Pawz!\" with a microphone below that with some musical notes.\n\nOn the back of the bookmark there are two stick figure characters, who I assume are girls due to their long hair, one of them seems to be drinking tea (Maybe that's what the brown stain/gradient is? Tea stains?)\n\nOverall it's very heartwarming, but it makes me sad that it's owner is without it. I was hoping to return it to the owner, I asked the book company if there was anyway I could get in contact with them, I haven't received a response yet, admittedly I did send it at about 1:30 in the morning so wasn't expecting a response quite yet, but if I do get a response I will get back to you.\n\nI also on purposely omitted some of the details, such as the book's name and the other names on the bookmark, because maybe this could help identify the owner.\n\nWould anyone have any idea how to get in contact with the owner? Any help would be appreciated greatly!!",

I also know a number of people just print their own customs for personal use.\n\nI was wondering how people's experiences went if they did get dust jacket replacements either by a publisher/large company or individual artists who offer special customs (I've seen a few artists buy don't know any by name)  I'm thinking more individuals and single per book cover orders over say a bunch of the same for a self pubbed book/business.\n\nWas there any issues with quality/shipping you wished would be fixed/any issues overall or was everything great/how you expected? Was there anything you wished from the printer that they didn't offer service wise?\n\nAlso, how much would you/do you pay if you do buy dust jackets- basic or \"fancy\" with foiling and velvet feel, etc?\n\n(In full disclosure in 2 parts, \n\nPart 1: I plan on in the future making reprints available for missing dust jackets as part of my small bookstore, though that won't be for a few years since I have to get supplies and actually get a storefront. \n\nPart 2: I personally dont like having general \"naked\" hardcovers unless theyre leather spines or special decorative editions, though despite this i have a number of them because i thrift my books. So im partly on the lookout for a good printer service/artist who has nice covers until i can get set up to print my own dustjackets at home)\n\nBasically, if you've ordered dustjackets how'd it go, and were you happy with how much you spent and what you got?",

We function as a collective processing the maintenance of our Onenesss. We aspire to be one mind, body, and spirit, flowing through the planet, and each other. Society has drastically changed, and for 90% of the remaining population, this change is for the better. No disputes, disagreements, or diversions in presence.\n\nFor the remaining 10% of the population, constantly under duress, hunted, persecuted, for believing Freedoms of Expression, are rights bestowed to us all by God. The One believes God speaks in one voice, to the One‚Äôs, and all who push against oneness, disrupt the message. Things are as bad as they can be for the ten percent, or Lost Ones, a phrase dubbed by the majority or ‚ÄúFound Ones‚Äù, have become Human Beings last hope for avoiding extinction.\n\nGeneticist underground working with the Lost One's have discovered a catastrophic genetic error. An error which was Artificially introduced into our genome to combat Acid, with perks of jumping the evolutionary tree to boot. The natural creation of human embryos by females is being sabotaged, and sabotaged by the highest of ranks in Onenesss. We currently process our One-lings, in laboratories designated as One-RD or Oneness Reproductive Division, which oversees the extraction of Embryos, from 1X and spermatozoa from 1Y The BioMass are placed in storage, where they can later be Matched, Grown, Trained, then Assigned. The lost one‚Äôs, need to uncover who, why, and how were being designed to fail, then how long do we have.\n\nWhat Happened to our progressive human race, on the brink of space and universal destiny? In Year 2099 the end of the ‚ÄúGender Wars‚Äù era, Humanity came to a conclusion about individual thinking, and sexual identity, it was a problem. Led by the Highest Ranking Vatican Official at the time, Archbishop Garcia, He along with other worldly Leaders, representing all Faiths, united and formed World One Order, which morphed into Oneness. Together they started a campaign to rid the world of all things that separated people, and groups. A new way of co-existing, a sole religion called ‚ÄúOne‚Äù, which preached that all are one, and those things which separate us are devices of the Devil. One, became very powerful in the arena of Business, Agriculture, Education, Worship, and Reproduction. At the Helm during the creation of One was the Great Billie Peirce, whom at the time was a Newly\n\nAppointed U.N. Representative, known for championing international laws in favor of Transneogenderism. It is said that, Billie Peirce was instrumental in ending the ‚ÄúGender Wars‚Äù (2095 -2098)\n\nA devastating War, that pitted two of the worlds most powerful factions, against each other over who should lead humanity to the stars. The problem was we never made it, past the moon. The James Webb-VI discovered, and Sythsat‚Äôs planet drone mapped the perfect course, too not just one but two habitable planets circling a yellow dwarf star 75 light years away. This should have marked the Dawn of Man, it only closed the door to the Universe. Who‚Äôs going to setup shop on these distant worlds, Man or Woman became the battle cry echoed by the Brother's In Arms Movement, and the Women's Leadership Continuum. Both Factions believing the other, would use this power to control the entire narrative. By the end of the ‚ÄúG Wars‚Äù the death toll reached 2.8 Billion Men, Women, and Children, an additional three Billion Lost to a violent disease that almost ended the remaining population. We also managed to destroyed 60% of Earths technological infrastructures, deemed unrecoverable. Civilization was deathly changed, whilst knocking at extinction's door.\n\nUpon the formation of One, the order salvaged what little infrastructure was left, and implemented a global stripping of individualized fashion, culture, gender identification, everything regarding distinction. One took advantage of everything including the world‚Äôs fear of Disease which wreaked havoc on the population, first appearing mid point of the gender wars. A underground movement challenging the war exploded on the scene, sex became a weapon of choice, showing defiance toward the two battling factions. This movement called themselves, The Naturals, and they ran the nights where soldiers dwelled in between the fighting. Acid was a horrible bug that packed a one two punch, which nearly knocked us out for the count. A newly discovered flesh eating vibac which was most commonly transmitted sexually, but was also rumored to be transmitted via shared dermal implants. A thing at the time to heighten sexual pleasure.\n\nThe Plot: Defining Adam\n\nFacing extinction, Humanities last hope lies in a young, unaware, unwitting participant, pushed into hero status. He who will learn to call, Adam is a Chosen One, designated P3399, or the three thousandth Pisces born since his assigned Clusters Oneness\n\nAstrology has become a huge catalyst in Alba‚Äôs audit control of us, so it uses astrology as a way to catalogue our journey to Oneness. P3399 Wholeheartedly believes in Oneism, and desires to see True Oneness fulfilled, away before expirational 55. A date that marks a full successful life cycle.\n\nP3399 is special, and will meet his 21st different than any before him. He is the missing link, and will awaken a new version of us in spectrums. As he awakens and becomes more self aware, feeling of passion, must be hidden, his newly found conscious, and truths, must be muted. Suppressing all for Oneness, is the internal chant, to silence the inner voice.\n\nP3399 is special to the Lost One‚Äôs, for two reasons, he holds a high level position in Oneness, and oversees the production of nutritional consumptions. A position like this, gives the underground access to all, who need to be reached when the time comes. Second, P3399 will Father, what those in the future shall call Heaven. A better world for us all.\n\nThe connection to it all lies in, character A3400, a beautiful double agent, three years older than P3399, positioned to establish a relationship.\n\nA3400, works as a Conduit for the Found One‚Äôs, handling the transfer of AlBa band data. Any data involving humanity.\n\nA3400, still learning how to manage her feelings, must teach A3399 to master his. The problem is, she‚Äôs now developing feeling for A3399 which makes keeping them safe, dangerous. Oneness becomes an intricate part of all life, all conversations, all Praying, all consuming, everything is One.\n\nGood Oneness.\n\nOne is Lead by that which is AlBa, or the One with A name, who is as ruthless, as she is compassionate, with a facial disposition of knowing everything. AlBa who is the direct descendant of the Great Architect Billie Peirce, is proud of Oneness, and one day Oneness will be Universal, with her at the Alter. AlBa, sees the Lost One's as a sociological danger and agents for evil.\n\nA3400 and P3399, have to gain access to the Central Hive, uncover all the deep dark research, then stop Alba‚Äôs sick, malformed plan to end us all.\n\nGood Oneness.\n\nScene setting: \n\nComplex One Delta\n\nTotal Occupancy: 500,000\n\n200 self contained level‚Äôs, or floors, per Complex\n\n1 Bd unit 1200 sq. ft.\n\nOutside Climate: Hot muggy, windy with sustained winds around 60 mph\n\nBeige is the color of choice for the Prime Order of Architects Mother nature is woven into our daily lives, but the chosen are not allowed to interact, due to contamination and will receive harsh penalties if caught smelling the roses.\n\nMost life on the Planet, consist underwater, underground, and in domed cities, with a majority of the population living in the Domes.\n\nSelf sustaining eco environment\n\n800 Meters Tall\n\nLife is currently isolated to 1 Million Square Acres in Northern Africa\n\n1.2 Million Square Acres Europe and Asia\n\n1.1 Million North and South America\n\nGlobal water levels have decreased 25%, mainly in the Pacific.\n\nAverage year round global temperature 101 Fahrenheit\n\nThe planet also sees, 3 months of hyper cold weather covering what used to be Summer.\n\nGood Oneness.\n\nBirds chirping.\n\nIt‚Äôs just another beautiful day of Oneness, as is always on ZION or ‚ÄúNew Earth Classification‚Äù. Our main character Adam wakes up at 5:00 AM on the dot. Never off by a second, so that he can receive his morning Nu-Co intake. A nutritional serving designated for citizens of his age, height, and weight. It‚Äôs Tuesday, so the attire for today is Beige. Determined by ONE as the color for calmness. Adam dresses, prays at the hour of Oneness, and then proceeds to the sidewalk transport platform right outside his door. Everyone rides the ‚ÄúTrap‚Äù This transport platform takes him and fellow employees to Nu-Co, where he holds the title of ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù of NuCo (Nutritional Consumption). However, today is different because Adam is turning 21, and for all members of our society this occasion is key to the stability of Oneness. As Adam walks into the mile high, triangular shaped Nu-Co building he feels different. He has a crushing desire to interact with people he‚Äôs never spoke to before. ‚ÄúHello. Good Oneness! Good Oneness to you!‚Äù\n\nAs Adam sits down at his desk, he feels a strange and sharp pain in his lower abdomen. Something he has never felt before. Adam then requests ‚Äúshade‚Äù, which then darkens his circular office windows. Chants of Oneness begin streaming throughout his office. Adam is startled when he feels two taps on his shoulder. He opens his eyes to one of the most attractive young women he has ever seen, or even noticed.\n\nThe young woman states she is new to his team. A newly transferred executive from RD-ONE, otherwise known as Reproductive Division of One. Her name is Avah, and she is straight forward, and nothing but business.\n\nTo the public Avah is the poster child for ONE, but to those who know the truth, Avah is so far from Oneness that she‚Äôd be public enemy number one. Or at least amongst the top ten. Avah stares down at Adam, as if she wanted to say something. She turns around and walks out of the door. Void of all emotion. Adam is shocked for 2 reasons as he stares at Avah‚Äôs data print. He has never fallen asleep at work, and it was very odd that Avah never greeted him in Oneness.\n\nAdam is deep in thought, as he glances at the calendar realizing he‚Äôs now 21 cycles on this day. March 11, 2145. Adam, who is referred to as P3399, is the 3,399 Pisces born from his cluster. He feels all eyes are on him because of his political position, and his Presidency at Nu-Co. He knows something is wrong, but who can he go to? With no siblings, Mother, Father Adam has no one he can actually confide in, and too be honest, it would be against the Law to do so. No personalized emotions, feelings, desires, wants, period or risk DProg, Bio Death.. A option to either wipe your implanted chip, or torch-burn the bio matter.\n\nAdam begins to pray. He is now scared which is a feeling he has never felt before. Alba, the head of ONE walks in to personally speak with Adam. She never does this for anyone. Alba is tall and thin, beautifully handsome, with every aspect of her designed to perfection. Alba IS Oneness, and the majority of the population who are true believers of ‚ÄúONE‚Äù acknowledge that. Alba has a hidden attraction to Adam, which she hides very convincingly.\n\nGood Oneness.\n\nAlba wants to talk to Adam about a program to artificially generate human embryos without a human host. She wants him to oversee the program. Alba is surprised with this new energy she feels from him, as she does with all life on planet ZION. All, except for 10 percent of the population. This 10%, or the ‚ÄúLost Ones, LO‚Äôs for short‚Äù‚Ä¶a phrase dubbed by Alba, are considered to be the most dangerous threat to the religion of ONE, and ZION as a whole.\n\nAlba is angered, to her soul if she had one, by her inability to track the LO's. She has made it her mission to find these terrorists, who refuse to submit to Oneness, and block our blessings. Alba, with a highly intense look, glances at Adam and says, ‚ÄúPlease approve your new designation.‚Äù Adam replies, ‚ÄúApproved‚Äù. She then turns and walks away.\n\nAdam begins the next day normally, as he does for the next 23 weeks. All while being haunted by the same dream. A Dream depicting a female he's never met, a crescent moon, a giant star, and a large man with squinty eyes, just sitting staring. Over, and over again the same dream, prompting P3399 to start taking a drug which helps suppress emotions, and desires, thwarting unwanted attention, and early detection.\n\nAdam spends a lot of time in some of the most beautifully remote locations on ZION learning the truth about human beings from Avah. She dutifully obliges the instructions to teach Adam. Neither Adam or Avah know anything about human interaction.\n\nThe two must learn to evolve beyond this No sex, one race, and one gender society in order for Avah to complete her mission for the LO's. Avah contemplates the severity of the mission, and becomes withdrawn. It becomes so overwhelming for Avah that she feels compelled to take action.\n\nWith the expansion of ONE, and the unwavering assault on the LO's, by Alba‚Äôs death and compliance squad. Adam must discover his own path away from ‚ÄúOneness and prove, Humanity is more than just bio matter for Alba‚Äôs mission to be the One. Avah must learn what it means to be free, and Love freely in a world where feeling are shielded. Together, they take the journey of a lifetime to bring down ONE, and awaken what‚Äôs left of ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù. At the end of every day, our reality is ONE. But could you allow your faith to steer you away from a God.\n\nHAIL MARY.\n\n‚ÄúGood Oneness‚Äù",

        "text": "The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas is a powerful and thought-provoking book that addresses the issue of racism and police brutality in America. However, its portrayal of racism and the themes it conveys can be criticized for oversimplifying and not fully representing the complexities of the issue.\n\nOne of the main limitations of the book is its narrow focus on the experiences of one black family. While the story provides an intimate look at the experiences of Starr and her community, it fails to fully represent the diversity of experiences and perspectives of black people. This narrow focus oversimplifies the issue of racism and does not fully convey the effects of racism on different black communities. In the book, Starr says, \"We all have different stories to tell. Mine is just one. The problem is it's the one that's being heard, and there's only so much one story can do.\" (p. 16) This quote highlights the limitations of Starr's story and the need for a wider representation of black experiences and perspectives.\n\nMoreover, the characters in the book can also be seen as one-dimensional and lacking depth. The characters are not fully developed, and their motivations and actions are often predictable and stereotypical. This can be seen as a missed opportunity to explore the complexities of racism and its impact on different characters and perspectives. In the book, Starr's father Maverick says, \"I don't want you to be the face of a movement because I want you to be more than a face. I want you to be a whole person.\" (p. 181) This quote highlights the limitations of Starr's character and the need for a more nuanced and in-depth exploration of the characters in the book.\n\nDespite its limitations, The Hate U Give is a book that raises important issues and sheds light on the issue of racism and police brutality in America. Its themes of racism and police brutality are powerful and thought-provoking, and the book is to be commended for its efforts to tackle such a challenging issue. In the book, Starr says, \"Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.\" (p. 200) This quote highlights the importance of continuing to fight against racism and police brutality, even in the face of adversity.\n\nHowever, to fully represent and accurately convey the complexities and nuances of racism, the book could benefit from a wider representation of black experiences and perspectives and a more in-depth exploration of the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, The Hate U Give is a powerful and thought-provoking book that addresses important themes of racism and police brutality in America. However, its portrayal of racism and the themes it conveys can be criticized for being overly simplistic and not very nuanced. The book could benefit from a wider representation of black experiences and perspectives and a more in-depth exploration of the complexities of racism.\n\nWhat do you think of my analysis?",

As others have pointed out, the narrative was difficult to slosh through. I don't think I'd recommend it, but I'm intrigued enough to probably follow up with the sequel.  \n\n\nProbably my favorite first contact story is The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell.",

Wade mentions how he wasn't the only one to find the clue about the Tomb of Horrors, but the book implies that other than Artemis, he was the first to scan Ludus (or any of the school worlds) to find it. The amount of effort it took to scan Ludus didn't seem overly difficult. If other Gunters knew they were looking for a Tomb of Horrors entrance (skull-like landscape), why didn't they scan all planets until they got a match?\n\nMy answer was that it would take too long to scan every planet, but it's hard to really quantify that. The books universe is made up of 27 sectors all 10 ly from each other, but I still haven't gotten a good idea of how many planets roughly are in each sector. The way the book describes the variety it sounds like a very very large number of planets, but again... I don't know how large.\n\nJust wondered if there were any other technical geeks out there like me who enjoy this kind of detail and wondered what their take was.",

        "text": "Before people assume I'm jumping on the Hoover hate wagon I wanna start off by saying I was complete neutral before I read her works. I heard good things and bad things, and I personally had no opinion, I didn't particularly care. \n\nI recently finished some \"denser\" reads: Jane Eyre (reread), Metamorphosis, and Frankenstein (reread). I usually like to mix in some quicker, smaller books (novellas, short story collections) between the large books so I don't get burnt out. One thing I heard is that Hoover's writing is light and quick to fly through, and written in a \"unique\" style. Now contemporary romance is usually not my thing, I'm more into horror, a decent amount of classics, a bit fantasy and a few cyberpunk novels. I usually joke that 95% of my collection 127 books is straight up horror (never calculated but I'm sure it's accurate. also this is not a brag I have a serious issue). I wanted to expand my horizons, but I've had little luck when it came to contemporary romance. I got mixed results unlike I hoped. Anyway this seemed like the best time to actually try again since like well I need an easy read. My friend recommended \"Ugly Love\" as this unconventional romance with a unique plot, poetic prose, and morally gray characters. Now I was intrigued cause I love morally gray characters and unconventional situations, it makes things more tense and interesting. I borrowed her copy since I spend WAY too much on books, and she was happy to.\n\n340+ pages of slog and poor writing followed. Now I'm not some literary snob who requires the highest degree of prose, but christ I hated this. It's so simplistic. Example of how it's like: \"I went to the beach with Rachel. Rachel read a book. I watched Rachel read a book. Rachel is happy. I am happy.\" Like where is the nuance? It's like writing from a primary school kid detailing what they did on their summer vacation. Also the damn REPETITION! I know repetition can be a powerful tool in writing, but using it so damn much just makes it useless and numb, also she uses it at pointless points as well. Example: \"I cry. I cry, and I cry and I cry and I cry and we cry and we cry and we cry and we cry\" or \"silence, silence, silence, silence, silence, silence, silence. DEAFENING SCREAMS!\" or shit like this \"My room is her room. Her room is mine\" and this egregious shit \"I and miss and you\". Like Colleen we get it, they're crying, they're silent, they share a room. I feel like she treats the reader like they have the attention span of a toddler who doesn't comprehend words and sentences yet. Also those are somewhat real examples from the book, I just didn't quote them word for word. Also during Miles' pov she does this thing were all the sentences are center aligned, trying to imitate poetry but like it doesn't work in the slightest. She tries so hard to be poetic but it feels so shallow. Example: \"Miles smiles. *That rhymes.*\" Yes that is actually in the book. Like wow what a revelation, Miles and smiles rhymes??? Better than the best poets. Shut the fuck up Emily Dickinson, step down Edgar Allen Poe, Sappho who? we got the best of the best here. Listen, I'm not good at poetry, but at least I don't act like I am. To summarize, her prose is too bland and simplistic, and just simply juvenile. Simplicity can work when used correctly, but this just mind numbing. Also I heard the argument that her intended audience is younger so she keeps it simple for their sake. Like what? First off I don't think young teens should be reading this shit, it glorifies abuse and sends out bad messages like \"you can fix him\". Second, young teens and even children's books do not to be so simply. Alice in Wonderland is an excellent story with good prose that can be enjoyed by any age and it's children's literature. \n\nAnyway enough about the writing, onto the story and characters. Cap is literary the best, all love to that old guy who has to deal with Tate and Miles' bullshit. Let's start on our main character; Tate. A fucking doormat is what she is. Literary this girl has no self respect, no character arc, and in the end is rewarded for being essentially Miles' fuck toy. I get it if in the end she realizes that Miles is not worth her time and moves on, but no, she just accepts him back without hesitation. Horribly bland and just so pitiful as a character. She has no friends besides Cap and two study buddies who are only mentioned once. Okay now Miles, a man who NEEDS THERAPY! He has trauma, yes it's horrible, but that does not justify him using women as fuck toys to deal with it. Like he promises Tate that she's just a fuck buddy then acts all romantic with her and plays with her feelings, telling her shit like if he could love someone it would be her. And like he expects her to not want more after leading her on? He's just a total asshole, so damn unlikable and has not real arc besides suddenly changing in the end cause he sees Rachel happy and realizes that he could just move on. That simple? No therapy for all the trauma he endured? Just a quick visit to his ex and all is good? I swear this one girl commented on GR (i think it was GR) that this book was for the \"i can fix him girlies\" and that is the best summary of this whole book. I hate that young girls are reading this drivel with a message like \"if you just let him continue to use you and treat you like a sex toy, he MIGHT love you back...maybe\", like no it's not the partners job to fix someone. Go to therapy and get some help, please. I brought this up with a few friends, if they actually liked Miles. I thought he was horrendous as you can tell, and I don't understand why other girls thought this book was \"hot\". One suggested that I probably don't like him cause I'm not into men, so I thought about it. I tried to picture Miles as a woman. And yeah nothing changed, if Miles was a Millie, I'd still hate her guts. Being a shitty character transcends gender.  \n\nAlso killing the baby felt so cheap too. Like I saw it coming a mile away and that's just so cheap to do to just get feelings out of people. I read more about her other books and it seems like she likes to use trauma as a character trait with nothing else. Now characters having traumatic backgrounds can be a good basis to explore how trauma affects people in different ways, but it seems like she just throws it in there for \"spice\".  \n\nJesus, well this turned into more of a rant than I thought. I know this is probably a tired opinion to you guys now, but I just needed to get it out cause it feels like most people around me in real life won't even hear me out at all. I don't mean to shit on other people's interests, but I feel like these books are just poor quality and push harmful messages to impressionable readers. \n\nIdk if I can fit all this into a tldr, sorry for this long ass rant lol.",

        "text": "This novel is famous for bringing to light the most popular vampire of all time, Count Dracula. In the narrative, the vampire from Transylvania intends to move to London and launch his claws against the new industrial civilization that was formed until then, in order, it is speculated, to return again to the center of power in the world.\n\nIn addition to the story, we can say that the book revolves around the struggle of good against evil, that is, the contrast between the virtues of the English characters and the perversity of the Count of Transylvania give breath to a battle that is not only physical, but also moral. . Therefore, the battle is not only to save the blood of life, but also the sacredness of the soul.\n\nSo, as warned by Dr. Van Helsing, despite Dracula's bodily immortality, his soul is doomed to death as it is corrupted by the vices and evils he committed.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth mentioning that another paradox of the narrative is materialized in the cultural shock that the English scientific society finds itself when threatened by an enemy that was believed to be the product of the superstition of less developed societies. That is, despite England's scientific progress, his techniques cannot deal with the living superstition coming from Transylvania! It is precisely here that the outdated \"customs\" of the common people prove necessary to face the vampire, such as the crucifix, the stake in the chest and the garlic flowers.\n\nFrancis Ford Cappola's film adaptation of the book ruined Mina's character. In the book, she's a rational girl and in the movie, she's just a stupid girl who falls in love with a psychopath.\n\nThere's a scene where Dracula offers a baby for the 3 vampires to feed. He's just a murderer and I don't see anything romantic or tragic about his story.",
