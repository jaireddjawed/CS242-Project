Muscle gain requires a lot of effort.**\n---------------\n\nI love to help educate others on the matter of muscle and fat gain/loss. And I am shocked how many people do not understand/are not educated on how the two work. So they make a maor mistake when doing 1 of the following: losing weight, gaining muscle. Anway, I will make it as simple as possible.\n\n**Fat Gain:**\n\n&gt; Fat = Storing energy. Imagine filling up a gas tank. But the gas tank is your body which can stretch. And the more you eat and the less of it that you use, the more of it will be converted to fat and visibly stored. You can store (create) as much fat in your body as you want. All you have to do is eat. You do not need to exercise. Just eat.\n\n**How to gain 1 KG of fat in 1 day.**\n&gt; 1 KG of fat = 7000 calories (fat/carbs/protein) eaten on top of what your body needs. So, if you eat, lets say 10x hamburgers (700 calories) in 1 day and not do much exercise/movements, you will literally gain a KG.\n\n------------------------\n\n**Muscle gain:**\n\n&gt; Muscle gain is a complex process. It is nearly impossible to gain 1KG of muscle in one day. Let alone a week or month. To gain muscle, you must do the following.\n\n1. First, exercise properly. \n2. Sleep enough.\n3. Eat enough food to gain muscle but not gain fat.\n4. Eat enough protein.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the difference between the two.\n\n**TL:DR Fat gain requires no effort, little time, and high consumption of food. Muscle gain requires a lot of effort.**",

It groups folders together and colours by file type so you can see exactly where all the large files are located. It also lets you navigate directly to them if you wanted to delete or relocate them. I found an entire game I had forgotten about 7 years ago that was still using 70gb of space. Genuinely it made file cleaning fun. Normally this is the sort of tool that is flogged as a paid 'make your computer faster' tool but it's a simple free piece of software that is surprisingly intuitive, fast, and effective at helping you make decisions to clean up your files.",

Many times, this robo-caller never calls back. I‚Äôve only received about 10-20 robo-calls in the last 5 years, and those were early on. Recently, got a few, applied the same tactic, and they went away. Little tip for anyone with pesky robot callers!",

So I looked today to see if I could find any savings compared to my national auto insurance company.  \n\nLo and behold, on the second try, I found another national insurer that is actually gonna charge me less than my current insurance rate. So instead of paying $95 more in six months, I‚Äôm gonna be paying $71 less. That‚Äôs a total swing of $166, or over $25 a month. And all I have to do is tell my current insurer not to renew in March, and pay my premium to my new company on time.   \n\nTwo bonus LPTs: 1) you can cancel mid-policy and receive a prorated refund for any premium paid. Premiums by definition must be earned, and unearned premiums must be returned. I‚Äôm not doing this because it‚Äôs easier in my particular situation not to.  \n\n2) If you can afford to do so in cash, all insurance premiums are cheaper when paid by the six month or year term. If you cannot afford to do so in cash, it is cheaper to pay monthly than rack up credit card interest.",
