What I'm wondering is if there is any harm in taking the low and slow cooked steak out of the oven, tenting/wrapping it in foil for a little over an hour while I cook some cornish game hens in the oven to satisfy the poultry eaters, and then do the sear on the stovetop right before serving? I don't think an hour is too long for bacteria to be an issue? Thoughts?\n\n(PS - no I won't/can't sous-vide)",

Does it actually muddy the sauce etc? Asking as some people like the extra texture variation or the idea of getting more vegetables in their dish.

Almost a reverse sear like the Prime Rib or Pork Shoulder recipes.\n\nI think I'd only be worried the outer layer might not properly crisp up before the outside of the meat starts overcooking.",

The soup tastes good, but the garlic is overpowering. Is there anything I can add that will tone it down?\n\nI've already made 6 liters, and I don't really feel like making more to dilute it. If I were to add anything, I'd added roasted beets.",

Here are the kinds of problems I encounter:\n\n- The ingredient list includes items that aren't mentioned in the instructions. Should I throw them out or did the recipe creator forget to include them?\n- The instructions are full of incomprehensible text. It seems like the SEO marketer have inserted a lot of unnecessary words for search promotion.\n- Some steps in the cooking process are missing. For example, when I was making lasagna, the recipe didn't specify that I should put a good amount of sauce on top. The top of the lasagna burned, and the inside was undercooked. I only learned this from another lasagna recipe.\n\nDo you face with such problems? It is looks like that all recipes in the internet needs to be updated so that 10-years child could cook it. \n\nHow do you resolve this issue? Do you buy paid recipes with awesome UX instruction?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/zl0dke)",
