She stumbled upon IIN and enrolled, but after I got involved she quickly cancelled her enrollment due to some poor reviews.

Also, it just makes sense to wait until later to eat your carbs/sugar for the day because when you 'crash' you're already in bed, whereas if you eat it earlier in the day you will be tired and ineffective. Lastly, the convention of eating dessert foods after dinner is pretty well established.

Protein-Fats-Carbs.\n\nI feel great on 30-30-40 macros, but my body does make use of the extra protein in a 35-25-40 macros split.  \n\nI'm 185lbs, so for me there's a difference of 240g - 195g = 45g of protein between the two macro splits and 76.8g - 70.5g = 6.3g of fat between the two macro splits.  Carbs remain the same in both at 269g.  \n\nMy goal is maintenance.  \n\nThe only drawback with the 35-25-40 split is that I feel worse when my protein and omega-6 fats come from different sources.  There's something about getting animal fats for omega-6 that come from the same source as your protein that feels really go somehow, maybe digests easier or is more synergistic in the body somehow.  \n\nThe only differences in the two macro splits are either 12oz of 93% lean ground turkey thigh in 30-30-40 split vs. 16oz of 99% lean ground turkey breast + 1tbsp of grapeseed oil.",

So if you look at the grammar then \"added\" might apply to all three items in the list; that would be weird, though, since  how many foods naturally have salt (making \"added salt\" a thing) or naturally have alcohol (making \"added alcohol\" a thing). That's why one would assume that \"added\" is meant only to apply to \"sugar\". Thanks and sorry to bother you.",

Recently though I’ve found myself getting hungrier earlier in the day and not being able to make it to lunch without needing more food, so I switched to potatoes instead of oatmeal. I will slice up 2 medium size potatoes and air fry them with frozen peppers and onions at 400 degrees for 15 or so minutes. But I’ve read online now that potatoes are very high on the glycemic index and spike your blood sugar really high. Should I be worried about that? Would oatmeal be the better choice despite not being as satiating?",
