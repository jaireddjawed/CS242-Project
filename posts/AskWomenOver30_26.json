I have been hurt so many times that I feel my walls are really up now. \n\nLately I’ve been finding myself feeling more and more trustful of the universe. I used to get so concerned if I felt someone didn’t like me, or didn’t understand me. I would try so hard to explain myself, apologise, fight or freeze - just really scared of being abandoned. \n\nBut lately I’ve reached a point where I’ve lost so much that I don’t care to try and keep people in my life. \n\nIf they want to be in my life they will treat me respectfully and not put me in situations that make me angry, hurt or confused. \n\nWhen someone does this to me now, my response is to go quiet, withdraw and focus on myself. Most recently I had a male friend ask me to lunch, made me wait for hours, changed his mind and then gaslit me when I got mad. \n\nI was at that time running on empty. I didn’t know it until I had a month holiday. And then I was able to see what my reaction was all about. \n\nWhen he asked me to\nCatch up again I decided that I wasn’t interested. I politely told him I wasn’t ready and apologised for my behaviour. \n\nI’m not saying I won’t ever hang out, but life is so much easier when you remove yourself from messy, chaotic relationships that never seem to improve. \n\nI feel like I’ll still be lonely but now I’ll be lonely with dignity and boundaries. \n\nHe seemed a bit miffed that I declined his invite. Made a point about how my reaction was helpful in his inner work and what he will and won’t tolerate. \n\nIt’s such a. Joke. He didn’t care about my feelings all the times he treated me poorly.\n\nI was going to reply with another message about his behaviour and justify myself but I didn’t. My gut knows he’s not good for me. And I stick with my gut instinct. It doesn’t make me do mental gymnastics. It’s a quiet certainty that what’s meant for me won’t come at the cost of my small but important protective bubble. \n\nDoes anyone relate?",

        "text": " \n\nMy nephew D and I have a distant relationship as I've been overseas for a long time. His parents split acrimoniously when he was one month old, and he lives primarily with my sister. From what I hear from him, his father is still emotionally abusive, controlling and shallow/tunnel-visioned (e.g. blamed his latest poor performance on him using his mobile phone, and demanded D to give him his Apple ID and password). When he was still with my sis, he'd demanded my sister to stop using male hairstylists (because it must mean she enjoys men touching her), and had isolated her from her friends. In the last 17 years, D has seen his father date numerous women i.e. numerous women coming and going from his father's place and his own life. D's father earns quite a fair bit.\n\nD lives with my sister and the helper. Helpers in Asian countries essentially earn a slave's wage, but that said, my sis is doing quite well financially too. On the occasional times I saw D as he grew up, I observed that at 12 years old, the helper was picking up his shoes after he returns home. After I pointed that out, it seemed to have stopped. At 16, I found out that he doesn't have access to his savings account as there was a time when he spent all of the $100 my sis gave him, and from then on, my sis just gives him money as and when he requests. He has the Grab app on his phone and uses it for transport i.e. he hardly takes public transport.\n\nAll this might be well if he's talented and is on his way to earning a lot of money. Or he'll come into a huge inheritance. The irony is: 1. he won't be able to make it into university. My sis is now looking at overseas options for him. 2. The money that his parents have are probably just enough for their own retirement, certainly not enough to set him up for life.\n\nIn short, what I see is:\n\n* He has been growing up exposed to materialistic values (e.g. luxury cars and excessive spending) when he will not have such means. He has no concept of saving, having never had the experience. His father got him a brand new iPhone when he was 6 years old (kind of understandable as his father didn't want to communicate via my sister) and he takes private transport everywhere.\n* He grew up with the concept of having a slave clean the toilet, pick up his shoes, cook dinner for the family. He has no idea of family rituals like cleaning together, cooking together, doing chores to help alleviate another person's burden.\n* He doesn't know the concept of communicating transparently. In his and my household, people are passive aggressive or aggressive. They don't know how to collaborate and communicate to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome.\n\nHe's not set up for success at all. I'm very concerned for his emotional, physical, financial and mental wellbeing in future. If he isn't supported, he'll most likely have a string of failed relationships on top of failed studies/jobs.\n\nHis birthday is coming up and I was thinking of writing him a letter with life tips (e.g. \"Do your own chores e.g. clean the toilet. When you have a partner, make sure you continue doing your fair share and if you really do love your partner, even think of doing their share.\") Is this one-time letter the best way I can use since I don't have much access to him? Or is there a better way.\n\nTL;DR: Nephew brought up with dodgy life values. I fear he may fail in life or become a toxic person. Should I write a letter full of life tips for his 17th birthday present?",

She no longer works here bc she’s going back to school but she comes to the station from time to time to hang out with the boys.

I suppose I felt ready to be in communication again but I don’t want to have a close contact anymore. Just the occasional funny reel on social media. \n\nToday he asked me if I’d like to catch up, but said he understands if I don’t. \n\nI don’t want to.

I feel he resents me and he’s always trying to get me to meet his gf. \n\nHow do I politely say that I don’t feel any good will come from catching up?

So I want to grow my understanding.\n\nWhat would an example of emotional abuse be?  What would an example of mental abuse be?\n\nAre these legit legal terms being used now? Or is this the jargon of youth alluding to verbal abuse that has negatively impacted their emotional and mental health?\n\nI deeply value this community and look forward to learning from you all.",

However, I'm starting to date again and while I guess I see myself getting married and know thats what I want, that just feels like such a far cry from where I'm at now that I don't really feel like that's my approach to dating. \n\nAdditional background is that I'm online dating and I'm online dating for the first time, so meeting literal strangers is hard to see the first few dates as vetting a potential lifelong partner. I mostly just accept a first date if they seem interesting/normal and hope that it isn't totally weird. In my mind if we go on a few dates because they are fun/I enjoy them as a person but I don't see myself marrying them that is fine by me. But when I see posts about dating intentionally, I worry that I'm too laissez-faire about the whole thing and that I should be more goal-oriented/only move forward with \"serious\" relationships. \n\nI know I want marriage because I wanted it in my last relationship - we were looking at rings/living together (all the while he was cheating on me) but now that I am app dating I just struggle to see the outcome as marriage/long-term. Am I alone in this? Does or did anyone approach online dating as an interesting way to meet people and end up with something serious? Or do I need to pivot my tactics? And yes, before anyone asks I am in therapy and my therapists thinks I'm keeping people at a distance so I don't get hurt again. Do with that what you will.",

        "text": "Hello all, I [F27] have been dating my boyfriend [M32] for less than a year. He has an 8 year old daughter from a previous relationship. \n\nI know a lot will judge us, but I met his daughter very early on. He had her on weekends, so there wasn't much we could do to able to see each other and protect her from early relationship dating. I was introduced as a friend, so we'd hope that would be okay. We were just trying to make things work with what we have. I absolutely adore his daughter, and I love and miss her. She's an amazing little girl.\n\nAbout 2-3 months into us dating, his baby mom and her family picked up and moved across the country for more affordable cost of living. He was heartbroken he wouldn't be able to see his daughter regularly. However, he put his foot down because he's already moved across the country for the family 2 years ago, and he was tired of having to follow them wherever they decided to live. We figured she would be old enough soon to be able to decide who she'd rather live with, and we knew she'd choose him because she loves her dad. We planned on maybe having her for summers. We were going to figure out a way. \n\n2-3 months after they moved, the baby mom tragically passed away. She had horrible debilitating epilepsy and she passed away in the bathroom because nobody was around to ensure she wasn't seizing and help her. The baby mom's mom and her husband were asleep in bed when it occurred. Their daughter was thankfully at school and did not have to see her mom that way. \n\nMy boyfriend has since moved in with me and my family. His previous landlord made him room with a disgusting older man that was working with all of them at the same job and needed a place to stay. This man brought bedbugs into the house. I couldn't stand to see my boyfriend living that way, so he moved in with me. My family is a whole different complicated story, but to keep it short, my dad passed away last year, and my mom is selling the house. We can't afford rent in this area. \n\nSince his baby mom has passed away, his daughter needs him, and we need somewhere we can afford to live. So we decided we will pick up and move to them. We should be moving in 2-3 months. I'm nervous, but the area has its benefits and I think it will be good for me. I should be able to find a job in my field easier, there's plenty of outdoor recreation, and I should be able to afford to buy my own house here. \n\nSorry for the rambling - our lives have been a shit show, but we've done very well together. He's a great dad, and he loves how good I am with his daughter. \n\nThe thing is, I've never dated anyone with kids before him. I was actually very hesitant to date him because of his kid. I almost canceled our first date. I'm very happy I didn't. I am very \"motherly\". I read a lot on reddit, and I know the basics of what to do and what not to do. But I could use some extra advice. \n\nWe both talk to his daughter on the phone. She gets along with me and asks to speak to me often. We keep \"girl secrets\" from her dad, it's so cute. But half the time we call, she starts crying about something. Yesterday it was a made up imaginary story about the sun and the moon dying. Before she's cried about her guinea pig that passed away years ago, a cat they had to rehome, just miscellaneous things. I know she's just coping. There's a deep sadness in her from losing her mom. \n\nYesterday, she asked if we were getting married or who he is marrying, and he said he is going to marry me. I can't remember the exact wording. She said she doesn't want a little sister. We've discussed kids before, my boyfriend is dying to have another baby with me. Obviously, that's not going to happen until we've bought a home, married, and I decide to take out my IUD. I'm hoping after some years to adjust she'll be okay with us having kids together. But I don't want her to think we're replacing her or anything of the sort. Then she asked me what she will be to me. I'm surprised she's thought this far ahead. I told her she's going to be my very good friend and we're going to have tea parties together. \n\nSometimes, I just don't know how to speak to her. She's at an age where I don't want to sound patronizing and condescending like she's a baby, but she's definitely still just a child. It's difficult to navigate. She's smart as hell. I don't know what's age appropriate, so I always go with the mindset that she's very young and I try to tailor my words. I just hope I'm not treating her too young for her age. \n\nThis little girl has been through so much. Her mother and father had a very rocky relationship. He always tried not to argue or yell in front of her, but the baby mom always yelled she \"didn't give a f***\" whether they yelled infront of her or not. My boyfriend and I do not yell when we have a disagreement. In fact, I get quieter the more serious I am. I said we are absolutely not arguing like that in front of her, and he's relieved about this. I know this little girl has probably heard things she definitely should never have heard. I'm sure it's made her grow up a little too fast as I can relate with my own childhood. \n\nHow do I navigate speaking with her, helping her through the tragedies she's had to endure, and treating her age appropriately? How do I build a solid foundation for us to have a great relationship? I'm obviously never going to make her call me mom. The grandma made it a point to tell my boyfriend that I'm not replacing her mom and my boyfriend was (basically) like well duh, nobody could replace her real mom, we will honor her memory, etc. So, not only am I trying to navigate building a relationship with his daughter, but I'm worried about being accepted. My boyfriend said the grandma will love me once she sees how I treat his daughter. \n\nAny advice at all is more than welcome. This is a very complicated situation. But I'm looking forward to it. Thanks in advance. \n\nTL;DR - my boyfriend and I are moving to see his daughter after her mom passed away. His daughter is fond of me, but I want to do this right. I have no experience with kids in my adult life and don't know how to navigate this.",

We did make out a few times, which certainly didn’t help the crush. I knew I was bi and was kind of quietly out (my boyfriend knew, my best friend from HS knew, I’d tell someone if asked directly, etc.) Her status seemed very unclear to me and it seemed like it might have just been a drunk party thing for her.\n\nWe became extremely close friends during and after college - my crush kind of faded because I told myself it was never going to happen and we’d travel together sharing beds, briefly lived together, and eventually became best friends. Eventually she did come out to me as bi. We both got married to men and were in each others weddings. I still thought she was hot but I had successfully distanced myself from the crush and nothing had happened since college and then one quick seemingly joking kiss when were traveling for a place known for it’s romance.\n\nFast-forward 10 years to our mid-30s and during Covid things got a little weird. Not physically but emotionally - we were bubbling together, I shared that I thought I was more of a lesbian than anything and that my husband was basically the exception at this point - I hadn’t had a crush on another man in a over a decade but had had multiple crushes on women. She shared that she was basically feeling the same way about her own marriage. We talked about how if either of us got divorced/widowed we couldn’t imagine dating another man. \n\nShe even started doing this weird thing where she started referring to our hangouts as “dates” and would bring up the time we made out in college a few times. She’d also bring up our makeout sessions a few times. I tried to probe that a little and she’d change the subject. We were drinking a lot during these hangouts and when I’d get to 3 or 4 drinks, I’d realize my old crush feelings were starting to come back. We’d have these long, incredibly emotional talks about things but it was never about “us” so I figured any signals from her were just in my head. It went from feeling those crush feelings when we hung out to feeling them sober.\n\nThen the world opened back up, people in our social circle started doing group hangs again, bubbles were over and that level of emotional intimacy disappeared. The problem on my end is that crush is still firmly back.\n\nIt’s been 2 years and I don’t know how to deal with it anymore. It won’t go away. We still hang out 2-3 times a month and text every day. We still take girl’s weekends sometimes. My husband knows about my initial crush and jokingly refers to her as my wife. He even asked jokingly if anything romantic happened after our most recent girl’s weekend and I said something like “sadly, no” which he laughed at.\n\nHas anyone here been in this kind of thing on either side of the equation? Do I keep it quiet and hope that it fades again? Do I finally tell her? Do I tell her everything? Do I retreat and put up some firm boundaries? If I finally tell her, I guess I also need to tell my husband that it’s gotten more intense again and that I plan to tell her. I’m just at a point that it feels unsustainable and unhealthy.",

        "text": "I've been in a state of indecision for the past year over whether I, a 30-year-old female, should stay with my 36-year-old male partner of 6 years or leave in search of someone more compatible. I keep changing my mind about what I want, and I'm not sure if I just believe there's someone better out there or if I've come to terms with the fact that he's not right for me. This is my first long-term relationship, so it's hard to know what it would be like with someone else.\n\nI recently read an article that made me question my decisions, as someone who always strives for me: [**https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/03/marry-him/306651/**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/03/marry-him/306651/)\n\nReasons to stay:\n\n* We have similar financial goals and values, which are important to me and would be hard to find elsewhere. \n* We spend a lot of time together and I usually enjoy his company and conversation. I miss him when we're apart for a day, and I'm not sure I'll find someone else to spend so much time with.\n* I'm attracted to him and love him deeply and believe he feels the same way. I will admit my attraction for him has gone done some as he has let himself go a little over the years.\n* Our sex life is decent and frequent. Although I sometimes think sex with other men might be more exciting, I'm generally satisfied.\n* He's laid back and not jealous, which I appreciate. For example, if I want to travel home for 3 weeks (rare occasion), but he'll take care of the dog and doesn't complain.\n* He's kind, cares for me, and is never mean or angry, even when I can get moody and take things out on him at times.\n* He motivates me and makes me feel capable of anything.\n\nReasons to leave:\n\n* Lack of shared interests in experiences and fun activities. My partner does not seem to be interested in these things and rarely wants to participate. I always end up having to plan everything, making me feel like I'm dragging him along.\n* Lack of planning and initiating vacations. I always have to plan trips and ask him to go, even though I've hinted and asked multiple times. He has never surprised me with a trip or a weekend getaway in the 6 years we've been together. He is VERY cheap and doesn't like flying which I think is sometimes the reason why rather than him not wanting to actually go on the vacation as he talks about \n* No gifts for special occasions like birthdays, Christmas, and Valentine's Day. He used to be good at this, but now he finds it stupid. It upsets me every year.\n* Lack of affection and physical touch. I am also not the best at this, but I crave PDA. We rarely say \"I love you\" anymore and only touch during sex or when we're in bed. I feel jealous of friends who have partners who show more affection.\n* Uncertainty about marriage and children. He doesn't seem to have a strong desire for either, and I worry that he may change his mind later. I've asked for a clear answer, but I don't think I can rely on it. I crave romance and feel like he's not fulfilling my needs.\n* Everything is always postponed for the future. There are always excuses for why things can't happen now, and when the future comes, there are new excuses. This concerns me because I keep thinking things will change, but they never do.\n* Lack of household chores. He does the bare minimum, and I feel ungrateful for the work I do for him. I feel unloved and hurt a lot of the time because of this and the other factors mentioned above. \n* Unresponsive to communication. I've expressed how important these things are to me, but he never makes any changes. For example, on my 30th birthday, I hinted at a weekend getaway and a small gift, but I received nothing. Same with Valentine's Day, even though I expressed how upset it makes me. I understand the above things are \"stupid\" to him but would it really be that much of an inconvenience for him to pick up a $4.99 card and write \"I love you\" in it? I love gift-giving but decided to stop bothering last year so I didn't get him anything for Xmas or bday, he didn't seem to care and I just find it all depressing. I understand I can't change his views here, but a little effort would be nice.\n\nMy relationship has been this way for a while and it's always been easy to stay with him because our relationship is good and I love his company and feel happier with him than without him. However, turning 30 last year made me reflect on what I truly want in life (experiences, travel) and what I need to do to achieve it (marriage, family). I'm ready for change and new experiences. We both work remotely and have saved a lot of money. We don't have any ties since we sold our house and are living with our parents, so we could move anywhere in the US. But he doesn't have the same interest and wants to go back to his hometown. He doesn't understand why I want to move, and I don't understand why he wouldn't want to try something new since he can always go back. I feel like we have different life perspectives and I'm missing out on a relationship with someone who shares my views. But then I feel like I'm asking too much and should be grateful for what I have and accept that no one is perfect and there will always be issues. I apologize for this lengthy post. Writing it has helped me see things clearer. I'm hoping for some advice.\n\nNote: I'm an ISTJ and my partner is an INTJ, in case that helps explain our differing perspectives.",

I did not mention in my original post, so as not to derail the topic, but we are coworkers. We are in totally different groups and work on different floors, and I plan to quit (he knows this). We’d keep running into one another, or he’d be passing my area and stop to talk. I tried to keep it short, but I was having a bad week, and can’t help but to have liked the attention. However, it was also stressing me, and I was feeling impatient and brought up the issue again.\n\nHe never actually said how he feels about me. He told me didn’t see our relationship progressing beyond what it is now. He said he has a jaded view of relationships and they’ve been a “destructive” part of his life, and he doesn’t want to hurt anyone or get involved with anyone until he figures out why they’ve been so bad.\n\nI’m not sure how I feel about this. I really wanted clarity on his feelings toward me. I never suggested dating or a relationship, as I’m not sure either what I want. I took it to mean he didn’t have feelings/attraction, but didn’t want to hurt my feelings by saying it.\n\nIn the few days since, we’ve spoken frequently, and I feel oddly enough as if this has made us closer, almost like a tension being released. However I saw him Friday evening as I was leaving, and it just feels we have this silly, awkward chemistry in person. I don’t know if I just have blinders on, but my gut is saying there are mutual feelings.\n\nI don’t know what to do. He’s on vacation now and told me not to quit while he’s gone. I’d like to use this time to figure out where to go from here. I am trying to be better at prioritizing my own needs. In the past I likely would have strung myself along hoping something changes. But, thinking of myself, none of the options make me happy. \n\n- Continue as things are and try to create a clear boundary of friendship on my end, which would be hard for me, and deep down I’d likely still hope for more. \n\n- Cut ties and possibly lose a good friend. It’s been very long since I’ve connected with someone like this, so it seems like a big loss. And it would make my bad work situation even worse.\n\n- Ignore the situation and find a new job ASAP. I’ve been picky about applying. I’ve been looking for niche roles that would be more enjoyable long term. I could get a role similar to mine more quickly, and see how our dynamic holds up when we can’t speak so easily/frequently. \n\n\nAny advice here? I really appreciate this community.",

Catastrophic 20s, two car accidents, cancer, months in a coma, years in bed, almost 10 years without any activities (work, vacation, socializing), loss of friends and money, social isolation.\n\n Feel like I slept through part of my life and woke up from a dream.

Growing up in a Christian family, I prayed to God for healing.

I managed to get two university degrees in software engineering and business administration.\n\n I feel that I am sinking into depression, after years of fighting for life I am becoming more and more sad and melancholic, I feel as if I am late for everything and that I am living someone else's life. \n\nThank you for your time if you have read and my main question is: what to do next? what to do where to go and what to do to arrange my life or at least try to arrange my life or make up for at least part of what was missed?",

While the situation has improved a tiny bit recently, for many years I felt like I had to take care of an additional child. My husband took pride in changing diapers and getting up for feedings in the night. \nAnd. That. Was. It. \nAnd he wanted to be praised for it. \n\nWe’ve had numerous discussions about all the tasks I’m taking care of. We started at “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” (no, darling you gotta think for yourself!!), went on to “do you need help with this?” (No, just do one of the other 1756 things that need to be taken care of!) and reached an elaborate list of responsibilities that we split between us to reach more parity. \n\nAfter realising that some of these things are pretty tedious and require regular attention and follow up, he simply refused doing them. For example: groceries. Checking the fridge and the pantry? Too complicated. So we ended up with an empty fridge and me having to run to the super market to get basic necessities last minute. \n\nI’m so fed up by now, I’m thinking of separating. This has killed all the love and passion I ever had for him. I don’t want this anymore. He is slowly realising that the marriage is coming to an end. He’s trying really hard to be the helpful partner I need, but again he needs me to tell him what needs to be done. Why oh why???? \n\nCan I hear from anyone if there’s any hope in this?! Has anyone been through this and had their SO do a 180 and become a responsible partner? How can I find love and passion again for someone who has been so irresponsible for such a long time??",

        "text": "My (24f) ex boyfriend (23m) from high school dated for 2 years and eventually broke up due to long distance during college. We still basically acted like we were together for a couple years after the breakup and remained close friends even after stopping the casual hooking up/“I love you” conversations. We had relationships through the time following but always remained close. \n\nAbout a year ago, we stopped talking as often and my relationship got more serious. We eventually stopped talking at all - not due to a fallout, just grew apart. \n\nI recently ran into my ex and I realized I miss his friendship so much. I also realized he has had a bit of a ~glow up~ and has really grown into himself.\n\nHow do I approach telling him I miss him?It feels difficult to reach out to him because he technically is an ex and we also live in different cities now so it’s not like we can casually grab drinks or hang out. Do I even tell him or should I let the friendship go?",

My life isn’t conventional, in my 20s I dropped out of college, left an abusive home, went to rehab, went back to college, reconnected with family and now I’m very fortunate to have moved to a new country. My therapist has been with me since I was 26 and she always reminds me how much far I’ve come. \n\nBut yeah it’s hard not to compare myself. Career-wise I’m still entry level especially since I moved to a new country. I’ve never been in a serious relationship because yeah.. I was busy. I dunno, I just feel very behind in life still and my ‘level’ right now (in career, job, etc.) I’m mostly around people in their early to mid 20s which makes me feel even worse about myself. \n\nEven browsing reddit, I see posts from people in their 20s achieving things in their lives. Besides this, as a woman I also have to deal with insecurity about being ‘older’ and men preferring women in their 20s. I know those aren’t the men I want to be with anyway but I can’t help my insecurity. Its not uncommon for men in relationships to have flings with younger women. \n\nThe question feels silly because getting older is inevitable but how do I feel better about the insecurity?",

It was shocking and upsetting to be completely torn apart and embarrassed in front of the entire classroom by a teacher/woman whom you thought was a “safe” person. I’ve subsequently been shamed by other women after that, and honestly, it’s all added up and created a bit of trauma for me. \n\nShould I reach out to her and let her know how her actions impacted me? On one hand, I don’t want to upset an old lady, but on the other hand, fuck her. There were a million ways she could’ve gone about that in a better way, like pulling me to the side and asking me to go change, for instance. \n\nPart of me just wants to stand up for myself because I didn’t know how to back then. But the other part of me thinks I should just let it go.  \n\nWhat would you do?",

It’s the worse timing because it’s now that I’m healing and moved on. \n\nBoth my ex and I have moved on (I hope) but the issue is being discussed on a social media platform with people who haven’t met me a day in their life and couldn’t even point me out in the street. The judgement from these strangers have been a lot. I’m also embarrassed because now people know how badly my ex treated me (lies, cheating, baby with his ex etc). I was always mindful of what I shared with these two friends but I’m also even more gutted to hear about the things my ex shared which further confirms he was playing me all along. It’s given me much anxiety because I’m SUPER private so this betrayal has shaken me up. \n\nI have confronted these friends and asked that they kindly stop but also let them know I’m aware it’s them spreading the rumours. One called to confirm the rumour and literally spread more info within 24 hours. But my question always remains, why now? What do they gain? How do I cope knowing these people are talking about me and adding lies to something that was a very traumatic situation. They don’t know I was being abused. They just know I was stupid in love and my ex totally used me. I feel like a fool and not the smart lady these people knew me as.",

And the worst part is that then I’m alone... It’s making it worse that I’m single and have no one there when I wake up\n\nI often feel proud of myself but then I’ve also spent a LONG time alone and also am not particularly successful. Just ok. And I’d really like a family but even more just to be in love. It’s kind of hard to be social and stay confident and friendly happy fun to be around other people when it hurts to realize how much more people - who I know - have? I feel like I’ve done so much and I’ve tried so hard and I still don’t have much or the things I try for. \n\nI KNOW comparison is the thief of joy. But it is sometimes automatic.. and everyone may have problems, but not necessarily equally. like when you don’t make much money and go out with friends who you can see they clearly are very comfortable and I’m like feeling guilty for how much $ this one thing is. When even the people who met and we talked about dating with, are getting boyfriends. Not only that, but cute ones. Like awesome for them. But that seems impossible for me. I get dates but I’m picky, but I think they were picky too. \n\nAlso aside from that, even though I’ve met a lot of nice people I can see how everyone is closer with everyone else and they’re nice to me but I’m sure I’m more of a side friend. They don’t talk to me one in one ever even when I try. And it’s hard for me to make friends in a group as I don’t talk as much but then I feel left out or I see how they’re all much closer and then I don’t want to join as much. It’s not that terrible overall I just wish I had some people in my life who I was actually really close with.\n\nAnyway I’m going to try to not look at my phone before bed and maybe listen to calm sleep music or whatever. And overall my sleep isn’t bad otherwise. So I mainly just wish I could find a damn man to really date and have someone to sleep next to again!!",

She wants to fight our increase in court/“ruin his life” etc etc. When I tell her legally he can raise the rent because of a loophole, she says I’m just giving up and this is how landlords get away with things and how maybe she should be apathetic about everything too? Which leads to a conversation about how I’m not giving up, its just the law/world we live in and I’m not trying deplete my emotional/mental health just out of spite for landlords or to be a hero. This is our conversation in regards to every single social issue, like a broken record. \n\nJust rehashing this is exhausting me. How do I deal with this situation? Of course I worry about the world, and I just can’t and don’t want to be carrying that weight all the time.",

        "text": "\nHusband (34m) feels the need to fact check everything I (33f) say in conversation.\n\nI told him about how my uncle was telling me he had to work on his water well that was 100 feet deep. His response was there’s now way.. that’s ridiculous he’s lying blah blah.. I was just like I don’t know that’s just what my uncle said. Why would he lie? \n\nHis response, people to make their stories sound cool. \n\nI ended up googling it, it turns out that wells can be up to 1000 feet deep! \n\nI just don’t understand why he thinks everyone is lying all the time and feels the need to call it out. I feel this attitude is causing him to have bad morale and relationships at work and it’s very annoying. \n\nHe does it anytime I tell him something my mom told me. Even when it comes down to childhood stories she tells me. \nI understand my mom is not the most truthful, but it’s downright distasteful. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I tell him? When I’ve brought it up he gets mad. And had to explain his rationale to me.",
