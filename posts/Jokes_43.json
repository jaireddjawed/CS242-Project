They were clad in the finest of armor wrapped in a blue cape and armed with a sword glowing in holy light in the land.\n\nThe Red Archer was experienced and pragmatic. They wore a simple leather vest with a red shroud wrapped around them, they were armed with a bow and two Chinese swords.\n\nThe Blue spearman was fast, athletic, skillful, and an adrenaline junkie. They only wore a blue bodysuit, they were armed with a red spear that oozes with bloodlust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, they had a hunting competition\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Blue Knight repeatedly fails to catch any critter big or small and destroys the forest in sheer frustration.\n\nThe Red Archer sneaks around to lay down traps and carefully snipes down larger animals\n\nThe Blue spearman with his skills and speed uses his spear to take down larger animals, He Died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the Red archer winning, the blue knight felt jealous and unsatisfied, so they demand a different competition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo they had a foot race\n\nThe Blue knight gave their all but unfortunately could not keep up as their armor and sword dragged them down\n\nThe Red archer was experienced in running so he was able to pace himself and managed to overtake the competition.\n\nThe Blue spearman initially outran both of them but tripped on a sword. He Died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Red archer won, so once again the blue knight felt jealous and unsatisfied, so they demanded a different competition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo they had a swimming competition\n\nThe Blue knight was confident until they realized they couldn't swim\n\nThe Red archer had experience in the water so he was an adequate swimmer\n\nThe Blue Spearman, however, was an excellent swimmer and outswam them both, he was then hit by a sword that came out of nowhere. He died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Red archer won, so once again the blue knight felt jealous and unsatisfied, so they demanded a different competition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo they raced on an f1 track \n\nThe Blue knight rode on a majestic lion\n\nThe red archer rode on a convertible \n\nand The Blu spearman rode on a dragster car \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the lion could keep up with the convertible it simply didn't have enough energy to match the machine's fuel tank and the archer's driving skills, the blue spearman's dragster however was simply too fast and couldn't steer. He survived the crash but was then mauled by a lion. He Died. \n\nThe Red archer won, so once again the blue knight felt jealous and unsatisfied, so they demanded a different competition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen they had an archery contest\n\nThe results were obvious and the blue spearman was killed in the resulting rampage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally Fed up with losing the Blue Knight Challenged the Red Archer in a duel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, the blue knight lost, because they never specified what type of duel and gave the Archer a ranged advantaged, Enraged they called him a coward and challenged the archer in a sword duel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen they started, the knight noticed the archer had obvious openings, so they became confident in their skills to win the duel, unfortunately for the blue knight the red archer deliberately had openings to feed the blue knight's ego and baited their overconfident attacks before counterattacking.\n\nOnce again the knight lost and was enraged and destroyed the area in sheer anger.\n\nThe blue spearman was caught in the crossfire. He Died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce again they demanded another duel, but the archer was tired (and almost out of tricks) so he tried to leave. Enraged The Blue knight was forced to reveal themselves, they were the king of Britain and used a royal decree to demand a rematch. Unamused the red archer threw his swords at the knight and their followers and ran away. \n\nThe Blue knight, infuriated by being outwitted again and again by the red archer, declared him a criminal and is to be arrested on sight. When they went home, they asked their advisor to explain how and why they lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe advisor told the knight that they were too proud, they weigh too much, and they simply weren't sharp enough. Depressed, they asked what happened to the blue spearman.\n\nThe Advisor looked them in the eye and said, He lived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning a priest was wondering why there were seven poorly hidden bodies in the church.",
