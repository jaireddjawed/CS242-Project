        "text": "Ive been a senior sys admin for over 10 years and always kept a keen eye on netsec industry. I read a lot on the job and have used all the tools in one way or another (at home, as a not-for-profit volunteer and at my corp job.) including: nmap, kali, metasploit, nessus, alienvault, various SIEM infra, pfsense, shodan/ google/dorking. My CCNA is 10 years old and ive never been a network engineer, but done the BAU stuff (know concepts/protocols well).\n\nNow work has just hired a guy fresh out of college who spent the last 2 years getting his CISSP. I'm keen to study on my own and have a try, and ive read the test material and full exam outline and, although comprehensive, i ticked most of the topis off as ones I knew quite a bit about. This new guy went on and on about how hard it was and that he failed many times, so i'm wondering what it would be like for a semi-veteran of the industry if he studied up in a month or 2? Anyone managed something similar?\n\n Am I under-estimating the detail expected in multiple choice questions? \n\nI have done many certs in my time, and there are some where it doesnt matter how much practical experience you have, if you dont know the 'Microsoft approved' answer, you will get it wrong and be duped into answers that sound 'right' but in theory arent best practices.  Wondering if CISSP is one of these types of exams where theory rules over practical foundation.",

Now the goal is to pass my MacBooks wireless interface to it and experiment with airmon-ng. \n\nBy default i can see two interfaces in Kali: \n&gt;     &gt; ifconfig:\n&gt;     &gt; eth0: ...\n&gt;     &gt; lo: ...\n\nWhen running iwconfig it prints the following info:\n&gt;     eth0: no wireless extention \n&gt;     lo: no wireless extention\n\nThis is probably expected since no driver is installed on the Kali side. I've tried to bridge the adapter from the Parallels config as well as from the Virtualbox config, both without succes as there seems to be now way to get those interfaces into Kali. Now i'm sure one of you guys must have had the same struggles with MacOs + Kali linux.

The thing is that they can see what I do in my room without my pc on, I've used a bug detector, a cheap one, and I don't know what to think, but they went crazy went I started to look, and I have curtains and doors closed, and their screams were pretty loud, like \"he's looking for cameras\", thing nobody should know, that was some weeeks ago, I've looked in several rooms but havenpt found a thing.\n\nThe main thing is my pc they seem to know what I look for even if I use Tor, also have been able to know what I write in Onenote, what I look at on Instagram, and what can I music I compose with my headphones on. Even my android tablet was subject to total monitoring (until I just snapped and destroyed it) but, as with my pc, it doesn't matter which antivirus I use, it doesn't found I thing, I've securely wiped my hard drives, flashed new Bios and reinstalled, nothing, still the same, used Tails, nothing, the only thing that seemed to work once was installing Mac on my laptop, I had no wifi just ethernet, so I was stuck to the router in living room, meanwhile they were talking loudly, as always, saying that I was probably looking at porn, which makes me say that Mac may be secure and two, they don't have cameras en the living room.\n\nTo summarize, my neighbors probably have cameras in my house, I've heard them say it, that they're watching me and that I'm cheeky because of it, also, a lot of people on my city know about, they do tell me that I'm being watched/surveilled, even my ex-friends knew, but never helped, (those bastards!). I can't find the cameras. Also the computer virus seems highly sophisticated, I fear  I will have to delete my files, I'm working on a comic right now and I don't wanna lose my progress, even if it's just the first chapter. That thing has survived wipings and Ubuntu, please if somebody know of any way to help me I'll be forever grateful. I'm going to the police for help, but I don't know how good they are with viruses (third world here), they do can help me with the cameras, I hope, I'll try to go next week after carnival, I don't wanna go tomorrow because I fear for my files and I have a lot of cracked software, I'll have to delete, 'cause you know piracy, and please don't lecture me I wanna do some money with my comic before paying for my things (I' unemployed).\n\nTl;dr My neighbors spy on me, they have hidden cameras or mics in my house, also they probably have a screen loogger on my pc, even with Tor they know what I do online, a good portion of my city knows about it and do yells me it's true.

We have 5 pcs connected through one router via wifi. There are 4 staff members using the pc's. Only 1 staff member has access to admin privileges. Two staff members use dropbox to share organisational files with no sensitive data on them, backed up monthly.\n\nWe also have 12 contractors (professional counsellors) that have access on the computers to check their google diary and to use the chrome browser for personal use while they wait for clients. That personal use is meant to be \"reasonable\" usage only.\n\nGoogle gmail is our email provider. Sensitive client files (intake related) are all sent to one e-mail address that can be accessed by the 2 trusted staff members with the aim  that these are deleted on a regular basis. The information is otherwise kept in paper form. Staff use one computer each and do not hop between them.\n\nWe have a Symantec Endpoint Protection installed as well as do a monthly run of malwarebytes on all computers. I haven't picked up any malware on our pc's since installation, so staff seem to be fairly respectful.\n\nI'm not aware of any interest by outside parties in our data. \n\nQuote from IT Security provider:\n\n\"Having a threat management security appliance at the internet connection is akin to the fence at the top of the cliff. Your best defense is to stop the threats from entering your network rather than dealing with them once they have which is what desktop AV protection provides. It’s still very valid to have the desktop protection but it’s now a strong industry recommendation to have protection at both layers – the gateway and the end point.  \nThere are several options here, you can by hardware outright and have it maintained over its useful life (typically 3-4 years) or subscribe to a gateway security service where we provide and vigorously maintain the security gateway giving you best all round network and security protection. Such a service for an 7-15 computer network will be $298 + GST per month on a 36 month contract\".\n\nSo what do you think? Thanks in advance for you help with this.",

        "text": "Dear Reddit,\n\nI am yet another former marijuana user who has questions about qualifying for a security clearance.\n\nFirst, let me mention that I am 100% aware that the fact that my state issued a medical marijuana card is considered irrelevant to the fact that in the DoD's eyes, marijuana is a Schedule I drug with no accepted medical use.\n\nAlso, I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to help me lie about my drug usage.  However, I do suspect that how I describe it may have some effect on how my application for a clearance is treated.\n\nThe level of the clearance is *Secret* and I do not anticipate needing any higher level clearance in the future.\n\nDuring my college years, I used marijuana experimentally with friends.  Around 10 years ago, I accepted a job at a DoD contractor who had me processed for a security clearance.  I truthfully answered the questions about my usage on the SF86, remarking that I used marijuana with friends experimentally a handful of times and that I understand that I must not use marijuana while working for the DoD.  I worked that job for about 5 years, and then I resigned and went to work for the private sector.\n\nDuring the past few years, I received a medical marijuana license from my state (which I understand has absolutely no standing with the DoD) and I tried valiantly, but rather unsuccessfully to treat a medical condition with marijuana.  Fortunately, I have since found better treatments and have stopped the marijuana.  I held the license for two years: a one year issuance and then a one year renewal before deciding that marijuana is not the right treatment for me.\n\nRecently, I received a very pleasant surprise: I was asked to return to my former employer: the same DoD contractor.  I will need to be processed for a similar security clearance again.\n\nI have a solid employment record, have no record of being arrested or charged with any crime, have excellent credit and no record of failing to pay debts or any reason for them to hesitate to issue a clearance other than the marijuana usage.\n\nI fear that my recent marijuana usage may be an absolute bar to me receiving a security clearance regardless of my otherwise being an upstanding citizen in the eyes of the federal government.  I did use on a daily basis for a while and there were more days that I used than I can count, plus I did renew the license for a second year before giving up on marijuana.\n\nIf I may still qualify for a security clearance, I am particularly interested in knowing if there is anything I should know about how I present this information will affect the outcome of the investigation.\n\nBut to be sure, I would much rather be sacked from my new job over being denied a clearance than receive serious criminal charges for lying on my SF86.",

Then if I run it again on folders 0-20, the first 10 print immediately while the last 10 take 20 seconds each. On folders 0-30, the first 20 print immediately while the last 10 take 20 seconds each. If I start with 0-30 and come back to do 0-10, the whole list prints immediately, and so on.\n\nLooks like `du` is storing some kind of variable that I can't see with `set`. Where is it storing these values, and can it be exploited to run arbitrary code? Obviously if you're running du then you already have a shell.

I would also define rules in the firewall (pfSense) that allow the Internet exposed server connect only to defined hosts inside the LAN.\n\nI heard it is a bad idea and I should use jump host in DMZ in such case, but I can’t understand the benefits of doing so.\n\nLet’s say someone compromised the jump host somehow, what prevent them from compromising the servers inside the LAN the same way? I must allow connection from the jump host to the LAN servers (otherwise I couldn’t connect remotely myself) and both servers run the same OpenSSH server, so the attacker could log in to one of the LAN servers in the same way they did with the jump host.\n\nIs it only because of the added complexity of compromising two servers instead of one or there is another concept I don’t understand?\n\nIn other words, why should I have jump host in DMZ to LAN servers when I can log in directly to one of the LAN servers and block any traffic I don't want.\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "I've been thinking about security lately. I want to improve my security and privacy but let's just say I got to the point where I was using GPG for email and quickly realized that sometimes it's more work than necessary. \n\nI realized today that it makes sense to consider a threat level expected towards something and to implement some level of security for it.\n\nFor example, let's talk about passwords. The first level of threat would be random strangers. A defense against this might simply be not to write down my passwords on a piece of paper and carry it with me in case I drop it and a random stranger finds it. Therefore, my password could be \"password123\" and that would be sufficient.\n\nThe next threat level might be an unprofessional criminal. If they find my password they might try a number of combinations in an uneducated manner trying to break into whatever of mine to see if they could steal/do something. Maybe for them it might make sense to make my password 'correcthorsebatterystaple' so that it is easy to remember, but long enough that they wouldn't be able to guess it even if they had a hint about it.\n\nThen I thought well maybe family/friends. They would know things about me... my birthday, where I keep stuff, what I do, etc. If they turned into a bad actor that might be a little more tricky. \n\nAnd so on...maybe next would be professional criminals...and then maybe a state actor...and then maybe the NSA....etc.\n\nThat got me thinking about security levels. Not everything is equal.\n\nMaybe I need a password to login to an account on some site I don't care about, that doesn't contain any personal information about me, and which I wouldn't mind at all if I lost it. Perhaps that would be a level 1 security concern and the desire to have an easy to remember password would far exceed the benefits from any complication to it. \"password\"\n\nBut then maybe the next level might be a site that has some personal information, say my address, that could put me at risk of doxxing if the wrong person got their hands on it and maybe a slightly more complicated password would suffice.\n\nMaybe after that might be something like access to financial stuff that would be a headache if I lost, but not terrible -- like a credit card number (since purchases are insured).\n\nAnd after that maybe my bank account where it's less likely / much harder to reclaim transactions.\n\nAnd after that maybe it's your bitcoin wallet where if someone broke into it you would never get it back, etc. \n\nAnd maybe somewhere down that line would be the revelation that you are superman. And then right under that is your weakness to kryptonite.\n\nEtc.\n\nI started to realize you could probably break the spectrum of threat into quantums, and do the same thing with security protocols and apply those to various things in your life.\n\nAs far as I can tell, if aliens or the NSA or something want to access anything of mine they are going to do it. I don't care how many layers of encryption I am using or how clever I think I am. \n\nBut probably my real concerns are not going to be some state actor or even mafia. And so maybe smarter people than I have thought through the above comments and came up with some kind of well organized methodology of deciding security protocols.\n\nNot only how to split them up, but how to determine what level of consideration to put them all in, best practices etc.\n\nI had an idea and I know someone has had it before and done something great about it. Could anyone here point me to it? Maybe some book I should read?",

About a year and a half ago I started working as a cyber intelligence analyst for this same financial institution. It’s NOT a very technical position—mostly what I’m doing is a lot of dark web counterintelligence and OSINT. I do investigations on suspicious IP addresses, phishing sites, etc but really nothing very technical, as we pass the more technical stuff to the Infosec guys to handle—I just write the reports.\n\nThe company is willing to pay for a cert and I would like to learn the more technical stuff. I’m thinking of starting with the security+, but it also might make sense to go with an incident response or forensics cert since these concepts line up more closely with my background in intelligence. \n\nThe goal is to be a cyber threat intelligence analyst in the more traditional sense. \n\nThanks for your input!

Anything with how data is sent or anything with networking I find super interesting as well.\n\nI've look around /r/netsec and such and it just seems like such a far reach for someone in my position. So a part of me is just sorta like \"Is it even doable?\" at my age (32).\n\nFor reference i've been doing QA for 7-8 years, the past 2 i've been leading a QA team at a company and getting into automation a lot. I have a C.S. degree but my coding skills got rusty after not using them much in my first few jobs, I at least get to do some backend work (Rails mainly) now, and spend time learning Embedded (Arduino/ARM/AVR) and Working on Personal Rails projects. So im getting better.\n\nHowever my network knowledge stinks and even further....there are so many fascets of Information Security that im really confused at what the best \"path\" is. Job security/career outlook is obviously a HUGE one, and I wonder if I can leverage my experience as a QA in any of them (Since my job is literally to find bugs....just a different type), but I also wonder if this is a drawback since I have a C.S. degree but never did Software Development professionally.\n\nIf it's still a doable thing what would be my best path given I have a Degree thats somewhat relevant and have SOME work experience thats maybe very slightly relevant? Also what fields provide the best number of job's/most stable jobs. Im sure \"Pentester\" sounds awesome....but I always hear how little of job openings exist for them.\n\nThanks!",

I specifically asked about expiration and reinvestigation at the one job and the FSO there said as long as my initial investigation hasn't expired, there is no problem with reactivating it and it won't require a new investigation.  But I keep reading online that if no company has picked up the clearance in &gt; 24 months, I need to be reinvestigated.  So what's true??",

Many will allow you to use a third-party authenticator app, which uses a time-based token.  \n\nI'm fairly sure that that time-based, one time authentication codes are significantly more secure than having a code sent via SMS. There are numerous cases of people having their mobile phone account hijacked with the help of overly helpful customer service reps. Then there's also the weak security of SS7 which is used on all mobile networks (although I haven't heard of this being leveraged yet).  \n\nSo why then, do websites boast the security of their two-factor authentication, allow you to choose to use an time-based authenticator app, but then *not* allow you to disable the SMS-based sending of codes?  \n\nFacebook, Amazon, and Evernote I know for sure. They got my phone number, I can't remove it, and now none of these services will allow me to use an authenticator app *without* having the SMS option as a back up. All I have to do when logging in is click the option saying I'm having trouble logging in, and they'll helpfully offer to text me a code.  \n\nIs this not the obvious problem I think it is?

I've noticed a continual number of alerts classified as \"STUN Binding Requests\" from my local computer's IP to 192.225.158.2. I'm also receiving \"STUN Binding Responses\" from that same IP (192.225.158.2) to my computer's local IP.\n\nIt is classified as an \"Attempted Use Privilege Gain\". The signature description for these is, exactly: \"ET INFO Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN Binding Request[or Response])\" and links to [this reference](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389).\n\nThis is happening even after I've blocked these kinds of packets with the IDS and done a clean install of my computer. \n\nIf, presumably, it requires my computer to somehow send these requests to get a response, I'm wondering if my computer might be compromised in a way that causes it to continue sending them. Could it be a rootkit that persists even with macOS re-install? It doesn't seem likely... Maybe it's an app on my Mac? I don't see any specific outbound connection attempts to that IP on \"Little Snitch\", which I've installed.\n\nAbuseIPDB.com shows that other people are getting the same issues (STUN Binding Requests|Responses) from the IP in question. It seems to belong to an \"ISP\" of ThreatMetrix Inc. : https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/192.225.158.2\n\nThreatMetrix Inc. is apparently in the business of creating \"anonymous profiles\" of consumers to protect against fraudulent activity, and a \"digital identity graph\" to allow businesses to improve end-user authentication ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreatMetrix))\n\n*Does anyone have any insight as to what might be happening, and the level of threat I'm facing (to my network, and with possible compromise of my computer)? Much appreciated.*\n\nEdit: I searched for \"ThreatMetrix\" on Reddit and found [this thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2bqv7m/coinbase_threatmetrix_browser_fingerprinting/) -- could it be that JavaScript from CoinBase (which is a website I access sometimes) is causing these requests and illiciting these responses from the ThreatMetrix IP?
