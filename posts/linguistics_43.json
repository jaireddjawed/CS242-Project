        "text": "So, [here](https://i.imgur.com/r0YeiDC.png)'s the change I'm proposing. Essentially, it's just moving the [a] to be a central and lowering [æ] to its previous position as the lowest front vowel.\n\nThere are three main reasons as to why I'm proposing this:\n\n1., This is already how it's used anyway, I've seen many linguistic papers where [a] is used as the central low vowel, and/or [æ] is the low front vowel so why not make that the standard?\n\n2., Gets rid of the unnecessary diacritic on [ä], which is currently used for the central low vowel, officially. As I already mentioned, this is also often omitted anyway, but I also think that using a diacritic for one of the most common vowels cross-linguistically is impractical\n\n3., This would make the chart symmetric, and therefore the whole system more elegant.\n\nDisclaimer: i'm not an officially trained linguist, i only do it as a hobby, but this has been grinding my gears since the first time i saw that IPA chart, but now that the 2018 version still has it this way i decided to at least complain about it somewhere, and see what actual linguists think",

Hungarian family names come before given names and referring to oneself and others exclusively in third-person is an archaic/polite register. These two features are common in the East/Southeast Asia area possibly due to a sprachbund effect emanating from China. However, the other Uralic languages (Finnish) don't seem to have ever had these features (although apparently Basque traditionally presents family names first but relating Basque to Uralic is bit of a stretch) and we know that the urheimat of Uralic is definitely out of reach of ancient China but could there possibly be a substratum (Hunnish/Xiongnu) with these features that ended up being preserved through the ages? If so, then wouldn't that be pretty good evidence of the Xiongnu/Hun connection?  It is known that large parts of the Xiongnu confederacy eventually submitted to Han China and most likely ended up adopting a lot cultural features. If these groups later carried the culture to Europe as part of the Huns, some of whom would later become Uralic-speaking Hungarians, it would certainly explain why Hungary is so different from its neighbours.",

        "text": "I don't know if this falls quite within the purview of this sub, but I've observed that historically, and in many different cultures across the world, personal names didn't seem to have nearly the permanence and authority they have in modern Western culture. In a lot of older, less\\-developed societies, names seem to have functioned much more like nicknames or titles, often changing with time.\n\nRomans, for example, would change their family names upon adoption by another man (a common practice) which has always been annoying when talking about Roman history and having to explain that Octavian and Augustus are the same person. Every Roman emperor since took on the names of previous emperors to indicate their succession. Over time, the last name \"Caesar\" became a title and the title \"Augustus\" became a name. Yet today we often know these emperors not by their actual names or titles but by their nicknames, as in the case of Caligula and Caracalla.\n\nThis lack of distinction between titles and names seems to have persisted up into modern times. Nobility seem to have historically been referred mainly by their peerage, not even their first or last names, which is always confusing, especially if they were granted a peerage during their lifetimes. The last names of common people are usually derived either from their occupation, their father's first name or their place of origin, all of which likely originated as nicknames for identification and crystallised at some point in modern times.\n\nIn many American Indian cultures personal names were often quite literally nicknames given to people as they grew up and changing over time and from person to person, or so I've read. This makes a lot of sense for a pre\\-literate society in which a name was just whatever you called someone, but is pretty anathema to our societal conventions today.\n\nI theorise that part of the reason for the crystallisation of names in the West may have come not only from the prevalence of literacy but also the practice of giving names upon baptism, which makes one's Christian name God\\-given and therefore unchangeable. Last names, however, are not part of one's Christian name and therefore have traditionally been changed upon marriage. Still, a few cases of name change persist in the modern world, as in the case of monarchs and popes adopting a regnal name upon coronation.\n\nIf any of you have any further information or examples on this subject I'd love to hear it.",

I am currently enrolled in a summer course called Understanding English Grammar. My issue is this: as a child and throughout my adolescent education, I was never actually taught nouns/verbs/adjectives/adverbs, etc. Or, I should say that I was taught prescriptive grammar in my writing but without being given names or explanations. So now, I am struggling because I can't identify the syntactic and morphological parts of  grammar and I can't articulate the reasons why a word is in that particular lexical category.\n\nMy textbook is okay but a little more complicated than I am comfortable with and because this course is only 4 weeks long I worry about getting lost and not being able to keep up.\n\nCould anyone recommend a book or some resources to help me?  I  have always been a decent writer and I feel like prescriptive grammar comes fairly naturally to me so I've never needed to be able to explain these things before. I just need some help with the rules, names, and reasons WHY something is an adverb instead of an adjective, or what makes something a preposition not an adverb?  I am in a TESOL program and I need to know these things for my future career. I can't teach English if I can't explain it!\n\nThanks so much in advance.",

'Yankel' is a diminutive of Ya'akov, which would earlier have been pronounced /jaʕaqov/. While there is no mystery regarding how the 'el' got attached to the end (-ele is the Yiddish diminutive), the infixation of a nasal has less obvious origins. My question is, then, in names like this (though no others came to mind), is the nasal infix a relic of a pharyngeal, as was the case in Dutch Hebrew? If not, how did the nasal get there?\n\nEdit:Apparently I was thinking of Dutch Sefardi.",

I am a Ph. D student and am trying to figure out the answer to this question. I would like to set up a website in which participants using different languages would interact each other in text and video format. So, for example, a person fluent in German would be assigned to a person whose mother tongue was Korean. Participants would be instructed that they may not use any English in written or spoken form to help in the interaction. I suspect that there would be a lot of gestures/picture drawing/pointing at objects at the start but who knows what would be the best way... What would be the most efficient and effective way to both learn and teach another language when you can't fall back on a crutch language? How would you confirm that your suspicions about the meaning of things is actually correct without using Google translate? How would you decipher if the other persons language has a similar sentence structure as yours(SVO or SOV???), etc... Once a set of rules has been set can we speed up the process of active language learning in general? Anyways, sorry for the long post.

You would always just use the verb conjugated for whatever the noun was (\"perpetao\" - I walk). So \"I like walking\" and \"I like to walk\"are both  is \"mou aresei na perpetao\".\n\nI was wondering if this was correlated - do other languages with one always have the other? Are there any examples of languages with either a gerund or an infinitive but not both?\n\n(Hope I explained this well, I'm not a professional linguist)",

What I'd like ideally is an overview that would relate more theoretical concepts and theories of language acquisition with modern pedagogical theory, and give some insight into common practices in institutions in the tertiary sector. I have some education in linguistics, but my knowledge of applied linguistics is woefully lacking. If anyone has any reading recommendations that would be fantastic... you never know it could help someone's education somewhere down the line. Any suggestion is welcome!",
