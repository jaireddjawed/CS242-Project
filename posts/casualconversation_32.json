I also introduced her to this hiking club that I recently joined a few months ago. \n\nHowever, recently, I realized she was a user and not a true friend. She would find ways to crash at my family and other friends’ houses for free. She liked to vent about her problems but didn’t enjoy listening to my problems. \n\nRecently, she randomly texted me (without anything triggering this, we haven’t even texted in over a month) that she wanted to go on our hiking club’s upcoming retreat by herself but she thanked me for introducing her to the club. I believe she’s trying to prevent me from going on the retreat (which I already signed up for) \n\nI accidentally replied to her and said that I understand and excited for us to go on the retreat and meet new people. I also invited her to a social event with the club before the retreat. She completely ignored my message. \nI am realizing her text is probably passive aggressive and not a friendly type of text. \n\nAm I overthinking this or is this seen as a mean text?",

        "text": "I live in the USA in a state that requires a yearly inspection of our automobiles. Several years ago I went to a service station that would promote that they would only charge half price for the inspection, but then I found that they would always find at least $400 in things that needed to be fixed to pass inspection.\n\nSo I found a different, independent service station that charged full price for the inspection (it's around $80), but sometimes nothing needs to be fixed so that's all I'm charged, so that's less expensive than the first place.\n\nLately though, every time I take a car in there to get inspected they have decided that I need new windshield wiper blades. This has happened six of the last seven times I've taken a car for inspection including one time last month (January) when I had personally put new blades on that car last June so I know they didn't really need to be replaced yet. \n\nSo my dilemma is this: do I continue to take my cars to this place for inspection and just accept the \"windshield wiper tax\" as a cost of doing business with this place (it's like another $40 on top of the inspection fee) because it's still less expensive than the first place, or do I try someplace else and find out how they rip off their customers, and possibly for more than $40 per inspection?",

        "text": "When I was little my daddio patio built a second story to our house and in it was a window that lead to the first floor roof. He was very stern and told me “don’t go on the roof.” I was merely four then, so it was a rational rule. I could barely walk, let alone on a roof I could potentially fall off of. But now I’m 15, and although my balance is still subpar, I know well enough to be extra careful should I go up there.\nThe rule has always followed me though. There were countless instances I wished I could climb on our roof and do whatever it is I wished to do. But his haunting words still lingered in my head. I was aware the roof was more than sturdy enough to hold me, but I didn’t want to get in trouble.\nI let the Dream die for a while. I abandoned the idea until it was brought back up again by my soon-to-be-stepsister who was to be moved into the room with the window. While scoping out the room she mentioned that it would be cool to sit on the roof. My daddio patio agreed and didn’t mention anything.\nThat made me ponder the idea once more. What if I went up there and just sat? \nSo today while my daddio patio took a short trip to the store, I snuck onto the roof. I turned on my favorite, most beautiful classical music which elevated the experience to new heights. I live in the country, so the night sky is lit up with all sorts of color and lights. It’s beautiful. \nI enjoy going outside at night and I love the sky, but I don’t usually dedicate so much time to the stars. I wish I had - it’s wonderful up there. \nIt was exhilarating, almost, to break the rules to simply sit with my thoughts. I love to think, but admittedly, I spend too much time scrolling to get any thinking done. It was so fresh, so new. I’m tempted to say it was crisp, but only because it’s cold here - below freezing, even. But it was nice just to be outside.\n\n(Much needed) TLDR; I broke my dad’s rule of not going up on the roof. I stargazed. It was nice",

Just to set the record straight, I am not a bootlicker, and if you want confirmation you can go through my comments. I also live in the \"killing county\" where that Kaepernick Hulu documentary was based on. \n\nThat being said, I was going to the ATM in the middle of town. I got out of my car and I saw this middle age woman (40s) still in uniform but no guns standing waiting for the ATM. Looks like she was not on duty but idk. There was a guy walking behind her a bit disheveled, had long hair, tattoos and baggy clothes but still looked clean. He passed her and the the cop turned and noticed it was one of her (I'm assuming)\"usual suspects\" from the past. She said \"hey, hows it going! Long time no see!\" And he said \"yeah, you know just staying out of trouble\". She then told him how glad she to see him out doing good for himself and then they started talking about his new family. I could tell she genuinely cared to see him doing better in his life. Honestly she had the personality of that favorite teacher in elementary school than a cop. \n\nHer turn came up to use the ATM and she let me use it instead and continued to talk to the dude for a bit more before they parted. She then mentioned that recently someone tried to break into the ATM and we talked for a bit how there's been credit card skimmers everywhere before we parted ways\n\nLiving in this notorious county known for deadly cops has kind of pessimistic about law enforcement in general, but experiencing that moment kind of have me a little hope. I feel like she really loved her job and loves it when the people she arrests turn their life around.",

We were asked to tell the group what our \"super power\" is. I said that mine is being able to understand my clients, since we have similar experiences. I can relate to them well. He immediately disputed this description and spent 2 days using me as his \"bad example\". I think the trigger word that made this guy hate me, was the word, \"empathy\".\n\nI think the whole drama thing was preplanned. He had some kind of roll-playing script that started with the use of the word \"empathy\". It didn't matter which of us said it. He knew one person in the group would use it and then he could use that as the starting point for his lecture. Unfortunately, for me and for him, I was that person.\n\nToday, I look back on it, and I have decided that the course must have been designed to teach people how to not get bullied. He tried to bully me and I resisted. Therefore, I learned a nice lesson.\n\nHas anyone else had a really poor Life Coach experience? I'm curious to learn more about it. What did you learn from it?",

He was in bed with the sheet pulled up to his chin. It had an attached bathroom. It was obviously the master bedroom.\n\nAfter that his mom and my aunt had a short talk about why he was in bed in the middle of the day. He was nineteen years old. His dad had died two years prior, and he could not seem to pull himself together. He was doing nothing. She could not get him out of the house. Her plan was to sell the house out from under him.\n\nWe bought the house and six weeks later, moved in. He had vacated the master bedroom. About a year later my aunt ran into the mother at a grocery store. She told her she bought a one bedroom condo in an over 55 building, so he could not move with her. He finally had to get a job, which he did. And, he had even signed up for classes at the local community college. She was very pleased with how everything turned out. He, apparently, was doing well.\n\nThink about selling your house out from under your son. Then get a place in an over 55 neighborhood. He will not be able to move with you.",

The ongoing issue is I often don’t eat lunch and then only eat dinner. So in 24 hours, it’s common for my entire caloric intake to be based off one meal some 20 hours earlier and liquor. I’ll exercise on an empty stomach, come home, start drinking a bit before I’ve warmed up/cooked food so not only did I just workout on an empty stomach, the only thing my body is digesting is liquor until my foods ready 10 minutes or 3 hours later. \n\nI am interested in seeing if/how my strength and physique changes simply because I eat a little more, drink a little less and take a half serving of protein powder immediately after the gym/exercising. I’m in good shape and have good physique despite my low caloric intake compared to how I workout. It’ll be interesting to see if anything changes notably as I usually don’t consume more than 1,500 a day in food. Liquor might bump that up lol.",

There was a man watching what appeared to be a movie or show centered around a grappling mystery. My acquaintance who was also travelling with me seemed to be watching along with the man (the subtitles were on), and told me of the fascinating plot he had discovered until then lol. \n\nLater, we moved to the newly vacant seats right across from this standing man. And now, when we looked over, another man right next to him happened to be watching the thing with this man, and the man with the phone had it positioned so both him and the other guy could watch, and I just broke into a smile and a cute giggle! It felt so wholesome how two strangers who hadn't spoken a word were now connecting over watching some random mystery together on a train haha!\n\nAnother one was later in the afternoon, when a girl got out on the wrong floor and came back in to the elevator chuckling and we giggled together lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's something wholesome you've had a chance to behold or experience recently?",
