So GPT 4 to me seems closer to a very complex statistical model that will never actually ‚Äúthink‚Äù and be conscious.\n\nSo are we still really far from an AGI?\n\nWanted some thoughts and opinions on this from people here!

Do you use dropbox and when you finish working with the files on a pc you upload them to the cloud and that's it? Because with the scripts it is easy thanks to Github, but not with the data files.  \nDo you use Dropbox? If so, the working directory of the project is configured in the Dropbox folder where the files are?",

I am now unsure whether to continue learning to code from platforms like YouTube and Coursera or focus more on improving my math skills.\n\nWhile I understand that math is a crucial component of computer science, I am also aware that I will have to take math courses in college that will cover the necessary material. Thus, I am unsure of how to prioritize my learning efforts.\n\nAdditionally, it would be great if you could recommend some courses or programming languages that I should focus on to become a software developer. I have started a course on Coursera for JavaScript by Meta and am thoroughly enjoying it. I am open to any advice and recommendations that you may have.",

The university has 6 different track options and of them I am interested in Software Development  and of course Game Design.\n\nFrom what I've seen Software Development seems like a good career to undertake and its the one I've been gravitating towards more.\n\nGame Design also sounds really cool. I mean come on, that's the reason most of us got into this topic in the first place! But I don't know what that kind of environment is like.\n\n*Can anyone shed some light on these careers with personal experience or even some helpful advice for them? I can take classes from both too as electives so it's not a huge deal while in school. However I would love to know what after college would hold for both.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am currently in a Computer Organization class and I'm kind of struggling with some of the concepts in my class. For example, we are learning about CPU design and such, and, for the most part, it makes sense. However, it feels as if there's so many ways that it shifts to something else, an example being that, in class, we are learning MIPS Assembly Language. \n\nWe have had to construct ALUs and overall CPUs that reflect this architecture. However, we have to \"keep adding\" to the ALUs and CPUs so that they can \"perform\" various instructions (such as add, sub, j, beq, bne, etc.) I'm a very categorized person, so it's hard for me to give each of these things \"boxes\" to put them in. \n\nMIPS isn't so bad to be honest, it's just these types of things that get me. We're also doing (what feels like) a million things in tandem. We're doing translations from base 2 to 10 using a different method than I'm familiar with, as well as Bias-127, etc. etc. It just feels like I have to learn 100 slightly different things and it's making my brain melt from time to time. \n\nWas wondering if anyone had a similar experience in Computer Organization / Computer Architecture class, and, if so, what did you do to overcome it? Did you find any resources that made it \"click\"?",

        "text": "Got tired of wasting so much time on all my dating apps just to scrape together a date or two a month. So as a passion project, I decided to build an AI-powered dating app bot that could do all the swiping and chatting for me to get numbers. Using dating apps I found that once I actually got a girls number and could call her, I could usually build enough rapport with my charisma to schedule a date.\n\nIt was important to me to make sure the bot only swiped right on girls that were actually my type. It was also crucial that when the bot chatted with my matches it sounded like me and used as few possible back and forths as possible to get the number. Once I got the number, I would call the girl, build rapport and schedule a date. This wasn't easy to build. The bot is designed to learn my preferences based on my previous matches, allowing it to understand my type of girl and engage in meaningful conversations that are tailored to my interests. This was built using a fine tuned version of GPT-3 trained on 5k conversations that got a girls number and MobileNet V3 for classifying my \"type\". \n\nThe results have been astounding. In the first month, the bot scheduled 13 dates for me, all of which were with girls who matched my preferences and had similar interests to mine. I no longer have to waste time swiping aimlessly or struggling to come up with conversation starters. What's important here is that when I call the girl, I explain to them that they were talking to a bot on the dating app. So far, every girl has laughed it off and been impressed that I could build such a thing. \n\nWe're living in the Cambrian explosion of AI, excited to see it improve our lives in more areas.",

That combined with untreated ADHD made me a very bad student...\n\nEverything's getting better this year though fortunately, I got diagnosed and started meds, read Atomic Habits 3 times. I'm finally doing better at uni. But unluckily for me the only subject that could made me sit and enjoy and actually eager to learn is Programming.  \nIt's a basic Programming 1 subject which teaches fundamentals Java and Python (from variables to classes, objects, inheritance). Man I love it... But Finance still gives me yawning episodes but it's a bit better than before.\n\nI've also started TOP foundation (front-end stuff) and absolutely love it. YES. Finally something I like to do and find really interesting.\n\nSo long story short, I changed my study planner from doing Acct + Finance to Finance + Electives.  \nI get to study 7 Electives! My Finance major is only 8 subjects, so I basically have the chance to study a major-minor in CS! Although without the official name... :(\n\nSo I'm trying to pick the diamonds, the absolute chads in a CS degree to study, here's my list after researching online:\n\nProgramming 1  \nProgramming 2  \nDatabase Fundamentals  \nData Structure and Algorithms  \nAdvanced Algorithms  \nDiscrete Maths  \nLast one - undecided.\n\nI can choose to study basically anything (from OS to CS theory to Web Dev to Data Systems...)\n\nPeople seem to prefer OS to CS theory here? So I kinda don't know what to do... This is where I need your help, please help...\n\nI'm also aware of [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) and it is definitely on my list for the future, the guide said itself that if you're not a competent programmer as of this moment, go become one then come back to the guide in a year or two... So I'm planning to do that!\n\nAppreciate any responses, thank you!",

Not to mention the disappointment of matching with someone, only to have the conversation fizzle out before you can even set up a date.\n\nAs a side project, I decided to build a bot to automate the tedious swiping/chatting process on the apps. It's been working pretty good, I've gone on 7 dates this month without opening any dating apps.\n\nMy favorite thing about the bot is that it learns my preferences and only swipes on girls that are my type.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/11npj3i/list_of_the_best_10_web3_programming_languages/",
        "text": "The world of web development is constantly evolving, and web 3.0 is the next big step in this evolution. With advancements in artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and the Internet of Things, web 3.0 promises to bring a new level of interactivity and decentralization to the internet. To stay ahead of the curve, it's important for web developers to be familiar with the most promising programming languages for this new era. Here are the top 10 programming languages to study for web 3.0:\n\n**1. Solidity**: Solidity is the programming language for developing decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a high-level language that is similar to JavaScript and C++, making it easy for developers to pick up quickly. With the growing popularity of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, knowledge of Solidity is becoming increasingly important for web developers.\n\n**2. Rust**: Rust is a systems programming language that has gained popularity in recent years for its performance and security benefits. It's often used for building low-level software, such as operating systems and web browsers, but it's also a great language for web 3.0 development. With its focus on safety, Rust is well-suited for developing secure, decentralized applications.\n\n**3. JavaScript**: JavaScript is still the most popular programming language in the world, and it's a critical language for web 3.0 development. With the rise of Node.js and the JavaScript ecosystem, developers can create powerful decentralized applications with ease. JavaScript's versatility makes it an excellent language for both front-end and back-end development.\n\n**4. Python**: Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. With the increasing importance of AI in web 3.0, knowledge of Python is becoming increasingly valuable for web developers. It's also a great language for data analysis, making it ideal for decentralized applications that need to process large amounts of data.\n\n**5. TypeScript**: TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety and improved tooling to the language. It's becoming increasingly popular for web development, and it's an excellent choice for web 3.0 development due to its ability to scale large projects and its strong typing system.\n\n**6. GraphQL**: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows developers to request only the data they need, rather than receiving a pre-defined set of data. It's an excellent choice for web 3.0 development due to its efficiency and ability to handle complex data structures.\n\n**7. Go**: Go is a statically-typed language designed for high performance and concurrency. It's often used for building large-scale, distributed systems, making it a great choice for decentralized applications. Its simplicity and efficiency make it an ideal language for web 3.0 development.\n\n**8. Kotlin**: Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language that is fully interoperable with Java. It's a great choice for web 3.0 development due to its improved performance and modern syntax. It's also becoming increasingly popular for Android development, making it a valuable language to know for web developers.\n\n**9. Swift**: Swift is a high-performance, statically-typed language developed by Apple. It's often used for iOS and macOS development, but it's also a great choice for web 3.0 development. With its focus on safety and performance, Swift is well-suited for developing decentralized applications that need to be secure and fast.\n\n**10. R**: R is a language for data analysis and statistical computing.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/11njqwp/coding_is_a_very_small_part_of_compscie/",
        "text": "For some reason, I thought by doing computer science (CS), I was going to spend all my days coding away on a computer and creating really cool projects and stuff. But man was I wrong. I am starting to realize that CS is so broad and covers so many topics that do relate to each other and coding is just a small part of it.\n\nComing to this realization was kinda disappointing. But as I am learning these other topics, I am starting to see why they are there, because I find myself going \"ohhh, so that's why a for loop works like that,\" etc. (This is a very simple example, but I am sure you get the gist).\n\nSo to all my fellow freshmen, don't dismiss your non-coding subjects as unimportant or boring. They may seem irrelevant to coding at first, but they are actually essential to understanding the foundations of CS. Topics such as algorithms, data structures, software engineering, computer architecture, and networking are just as important, if not more important, than coding.\n\nIn fact, mastering these non-coding topics will not only make you a better coder but also a better problem solver and critical thinker. You'll learn how to approach problems systematically and with a broader perspective.\n\nFor example, algorithms are the heart of computer science. They are a set of instructions that solve a specific problem or accomplish a specific task. Without them, coding would be a mess of random commands and syntax that may or may not work.\n\nData structures are the way we organize and store data in a computer. They determine how fast we can search, sort, and retrieve data. Knowing the right data structure can make the difference between a program that runs in a few seconds and one that takes hours to complete.\n\nSoftware engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It involves working with a team, using version control, writing documentation, and following coding standards. A well-engineered software is more reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain than one that is poorly designed.\n\nComputer architecture is the way a computer is designed and built, from the CPU to the memory to the peripherals. Understanding computer architecture helps you optimize your code for the specific hardware you are running on, which can result in faster and more efficient programs.\n\nNetworking is the way computers communicate with each other, from local networks to the internet. Knowing how networking works is essential for developing programs that interact with other computers and servers.\n\nSo my advice to all my fellow CS students is to embrace these non-coding subjects with open arms. Don't be afraid to dive deep into them, ask questions, and seek help when needed. Trust me, you won't regret it in the long run.\n\nRemember, coding is just a tool in the vast world of computer science. The more you learn about the theory and concepts behind it, the more you'll be able to create innovative and practical solutions that make a difference in the world. So keep learning, keep growing, and keep coding!",

This allowed them to train the model in a self-supervised manner just as other language models are traineLanguage Is Not All You Need! New Research Improves Visual Perception Of Language Models - A Paper Summary ‚≠ïd.\n\nTo transform the multi-modal data into sequences the images are encoded via an image encoding network. In a second step, the data are placed in sequences and special tokens are used to signal the start and end of each modality (see table below).\n\n[Sequence Data Made From Different Data Sources](https://preview.redd.it/zjj0hbhaknma1.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=efb7cc00a56842bf90d781bff10a0ae4f0256927)\n\n*Why Is This Important?*\n\nResearch into multi-modal models is highly meaningful in at least three ways.\n\nFirst, it will be very useful if a model can answer complex queries about images and other media. This of something mundane such as improved invoice processing software. If generative pre-training improves this to a point that we get ChatGPT-like performance on unseen invoices, the value of that would be otherworldly.\n\nSecond, today‚Äôs language models such as ChatGPT are only trained on text data. As a result, they have a limited understanding of our world. Further, there seems to be a limit to how big and powerful auto-regressive LLMs can become because we are running out of text.\n\nThird, it is not entirely clear how far LLMs can be scaled before we run out of text data. This is a fascinating topic and one of the next essays will be about this so stay tuned.\n\nIn a nutshell, the problem is basically the following: the [latest research on scaling LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) showed that we need much more data to train models than previously thought. As a result, it seems as though there might not be enough text data in the world to train some of the bigger models (500B parameters) that we have today.\n\nConverting images and other data into sequence form would allow tapping into a near-infinite trove of data to train models.\n\n*Stuff like this makes me excited for the future!*\n\nThank you for reading!

        "text": " I am considering adding a minor in comp science. I am a finance student and have a year left to graduate without the minor. The only careers I would like to pursue as of the moment is Corporate finance and software and possibly a masters in comp science. I prefer WLB and pay above all. I have an internship in program management for Continental in the summer. That being said, I'm thinking of adding a comp science minor but doing so would add a semester to graduation and 4-5k in loans to finish in Dec 2024. Would it be worth it? I can add a second internship during that summer and possibly offset cost. If i choose not to do the minor, I can take IS programming classes in Java and Python. However, the minor would provide more in debt knowledge to data structures and projects. I have attached a link and level of difficulty of classes(may be professor or material that make it difficult). It should be noted I have taken 6 courses a semester till now and have a 3.86 GPA. Is the minor worth it? \n\n||\n|:-|\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnw9ke69jlma1.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=42c48b2205de68c9738b8fc1a90453985cb46e43\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|||",
