        "text": "I always work late night shifts at a drive in roughly an hour drive from my house with heavy traffic. Regular traffic I can get there in about 45 minutes, if I am lucky I can cut off another 10 minutes if the streets are deserted which they usually are when I get off work. Anyway, tonight I leave work at about 12:24 or so. No later than 12:30 to be more exact.\n\nI'm driving home and it is just past 1 in the morning and I have some music playing off my phone. Lost the aux cord so I just have my phone sitting in my lap with the volume turned all the way up. As I drove about a quarter mile past the big Lifetime Gym I see red and blue lights in my rear view. Crap, I just paid my speeding ticket and sent in the paperwork to DDS to allow me to drive with my license. It would be suspended at the beginning of next month. Cursing I put on my turn signal and pulled over in the next available turning lane that was just ahead of me. \n\nI turned off my music and tossed my phone on the floor on the passenger side out of sight. The officer walked up to me as I rolled my window down. I asked the officer if I was speeding because I was sure I hadn't been but my heart was racing. He never answered despite that I asked him twice while I looked for my wallet to get my ID. It had fallen on the floor when I grabbed my purse. I gave him my ID and he told me my tag lights were out. \n\nSleepy and not thinking straight my response was that I thought the lights were permanent and never went off. He just said no one usually noticed tag lights going out. He checked my info and sent me on my way. No warning or ticket at all. Some officers really are good people and don't just ticket every driver they see. 😀",

        "text": "I agreed to stay over and work overtime for day shift since they were short staffed. Usually, this means I just kind of hide out or ride around unless I get a call. That was my plan anyway.\n\nWhile cruising down a particularly curvy and highly traveled road, I top a hill and see an elderly man in a wheel chair mozying down the road in my lane. I don't mean like an electric wheelchair, he was manually rolling himself down this hilly, curvy road. \n\nHe turns himself into a church parking lot. Since it was a Sunday, I thought \"Oh good, he's just going to church and he made it safely, so I'll carry on\". My next thought was, \"It's 6 o'clock in the morning, no church that I know of has services for another couple hours.\"\n\nNot gonna lie, I had already worked a full shift and really just felt like hiding out somewhere avoiding any and all human contact; but I felt I really needed to check on this guy just incase church wasn't his destination.\n\nI pull into the parking lot from the other side and drive up beside him.\n\n\"Hey there, you doing ok?\"\n\n *\"Yeah, just headed to the gas station*\" he said with a big smile on his face.\n\n\"Uhhh, the Texaco down that way?\" I asked pointing \n\n *Yes ma'am, I like to get out and about when the sun is shining like this.\"\n\n\"That's awfully dangerous....\"\n\n \"*Yeah... I try to keep to the parking lots when I can and stay out of the road.*\"\n\nI was playing his journey out in my head, thinking to myself that there was no other parking lots for him to cut through between the church and the gas station. The other side of the church parking lot empties into the road just on the other side of a very, very sharp curve. I didn't know how in the heck I was going to get him and his wheelchair there, but I couldn't just say \"Okay! Be safe!\" And drive off.\n\nAfter a little more back and forth, I offered to give him a ride. He happily agrees and is able to wheel himself to my back door and use the car frame and door to steady himself up and into my backseat. \n\n I folded the wheelchair in half and grossly underestimated how big it was still going to be even in the collapsed position.  I also realized that I apparently lack understanding in spacial relations as I attempt to put this huge thing into my trunk already loaded down with equipment.\n\nSeveral minutes of agonizing rearranging and actually breaking a sweat later, I get the wheelchair in and we're off to the gas station.\n\n*\"I didn't mean to be a trouble\"* He said, apparently acknowledging my great difficulty with his wheelchair.\n\n\"Oh no trouble at all. I just didn't feel it was safe for you to be in the road.\"\n\nHe is quite the pleasant old man, starting off with normal small talk as we make our way out of the parking lot. Then things start to go south, and don't get much better.\n\n\"You live by yourself?\" I asked\n\n*\"Yeah, I talk to my brother a lot though\"*\n\n\"Well that's good!\"\n\n*\" No........not really.\"*\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n*\"Well, because he's been dead for two years\"*\n\nI froze, completely blind sided by his nonchalant toned statement and immediately pictured some sibling version of \"The Bates Motel\" movie, hoping he didn't have his deceased brother still in his apartment somewhere.\n\n*Ohhhh Godddd, why meeeee* I'm thinking.\n\nI respond with some generic condolences as we make our way into the gas station. It honestly hadn't dawned on me until that second that I was going to have to get this guy back home too if I didn't want him rolling down a road he most certainly would be struck on.\n\nI get his wheelchair out and unfolded and he makes his way inside. I go into the bathroom, and wash my hands just to have something to do, and wait on him to get done inside the gas station.\n\nI'm waiting beside my car as he makes his way outside, smiling from ear to ear. I see what is sitting in his lap and have trouble keeping my thoughts from showing up on my face as I realize what it is he came to purchase.\n\n*SHIT!*\n\nOut he comes with two six packs of BEER.\n\n\"Okkkayyy there, let me have *those*\" I said quickly grabbing the cans and opening my trunk trying to shove them out of sight before anyone noticed. Giving a smile and \"nothing to see here\" wave to the patrons walking by coming and going from inside.\n\nWas it illegal? No\n\nDid it look really really bad? YUP. \n\nNext was round two of getting his wheelchair back in my trunk. I manage to get it back in there, and really just want to get out of there as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm almost back in my car, convincing myself that no one noticed the highly suspicious officer putting beer in their marked unit, when I hear, \"HEY!\"\n\nI look up to see the store clerk looking at me from the doorway of the gas station.\n\n\"I CAN'T EVEN GET THE POLICE TO STOP WHEN MY CAR BREAKS DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. WHAT DO I GOTTA SO TO GET THEM TO TAKE ME ON A BEER RUN?!\" \n\nLong story short, next time I'm opting out of overtime.\n",

        "text": "Background: Current College student studying criminal justice for LE starting an internship soon.  \nThis happened a few hours ago.     \n\n\nIt's about 10pm and I'm leaving work. I'm on my motorcycle taking my usual route home. I stop at the light of two major cross streets, put my foot down and wait for the light to change, singing along to my usual music playing in my helmet...\nOnly to be interrupted by the sound of screeching tires, the crunching noise of plastic, and the jolt forward of being rear ended.    \n\nGreat.   \n\nI think to myself \"Well I'm not dead, that's pretty good.\" I turn around and give the driver the universal \"What the fuck?\" Look and gesture to pull to the side. I ride the bike to the side of the road and turn my hazards on.  \nThe driver, female, mid 60s, in a Camry, seems absolutely unphased about the collision, as the light turns green she continues on.   \n\nAwesome.   \n\nSo I put my bike back in gear, and merge back into traffic. She indicates to turn into a major outdoor mall area, and turns in.   \n\"Okay maybe she wanted to stop in a parking lot.. that seems pretty reasonable\"   \nShe then begins to drive around the parking lot, not erratically but not crawling   \n\"Okay maybe she wants to stop in a populated area, I get it, its late and I'm a guy on a bike who she just hit...Nope shes weaving through stalls now.\"   \nAs she exits the shopping center I'm following her a few hundred yards back. She's driving evasively, making excessive turns, looping back around, but oddly not violating traffic laws, no speeding or rapid lane changes, she was even signaling.   \nAt a stoplight I was able to call 911, the call went through my helmet as I kept following.   \n\"Silver, Late model Camry, Plate 4 Alpha bravo Ch...Turning left northbound to Wood Street between Metal street\"    \n\nAfter around 2 miles of me following and updating the dispatcher on location and heading,  she indicates a left turn into a church parking lot, the dispatcher comes on \"The helicopter is on the way, what's your current heading?\"   \n\"Southbound on Plast...Did you say helicopter?\"   \n\"Yes sir, air unit is en route\"  \nHuh.......\nAt this point she had pulled into the parking lot, and half stopped the vehicle, creeping along at idle. I didn't approach and parked 50 yards away. She begins to drive off again, when from the heavens, all the glory of an air unit with a Nightsun shine down upon the car.   \n\"Stop the Vehicle and pull over\" what I can only assume to be the human personification of the voice of god booms down over the loudspeaker. \nThe dispatcher's voice interrupts my sheer awe at the situation,  \"Air unit has a good plate, you can break pursuit\"   \nI stop my bike and watch as she turns out back onto the main road and begins driving away disappearing around a corner , moments later two chargers running code disappear around the same bend. \nI'm still in the parking lot as the dispatcher tells me to stay where I am and they'll have a unit come meet me.   \nAs I'm left to my own devices I call my family to let them know what happened, and my friend(also a crim major and intern) that I may need a ride and to meet me in the area.   \nAs I finish this phone call the air unit begins to circle me, \"They got the car, have a safe night\" As I give a sheepish thumbs up and wave before they return to the night.   \n\nI get a phone call about 15min later telling me to meet the officers at a near by school. As I arrive there are 3 squad cars, and her car at the end of a driveway. My friend had already arrived and started talking with a free officer. I gave my statement and answered a few questions.   \nOfficer \"Could you Identify her?\"\nMe \"White, female, mid 50s, blonde, black collared shirt on?\"  \nOfficer \"Yeah that's the one. Looks like a DUI. She's currently under arrest for Hit and Run and DUI.\"  \nAfter answering a few more questions, and jokingly asking if they thought I could get extra credit for this in class, I hung around as they questioned her.  My friend and I ended up talking with one of the officers there, and it turned into a discussion about what he did during his internship and how badly simunitions hurt. \n\nPossibly the most eventful ride home from work I've ever had. I'm not injured since the bike didn't end up dropping, there was no visible damage to my bike(although it's going in to get looked at soon), and a drunk driver is off the street.   \nEdit 1: I realize the safety concerns about following after an incident like this. It may not have been the best call and I do not advocate it. I wasn't trying to play officer or anything. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/6bmxkc/officer_destroying_evidence/",
        "text": "Here's a funny story for you all. This happened just the other night at work, so it's still pretty fresh in my mind. To preface this, I'm a corrections officer at a medium security prison. I work in a GP housing unit, and this happened on a night when I was manning our main bubble (control module). \n\n\n\nI was sitting in the bubble with my co-worker who we'll call Officer Jacobs, when Jacobs decided to go do a cell search. Jacobs went to the cell, radioed me to let me know he was in D-6 searching, and I logged it in the chrono. \n\n\n\nNow, manning a bubble is usually pretty boring, so when a fellow CO goes in for a cell search, I like to pay particular attention to that wing and see if there's any suspicious activity going on. Typically, the offenders who have something in their cell that shouldn't be there tend to get pretty spooked when an officer goes into the wing to search, even if they don't go directly to their cell. If you're paying attention in these situations, it's easy to figure out where the contraband is hidden.\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as Jacobs got into D-6, I noticed that traffic was really picking up around D-9. It seemed like everyone was dropping by to let the cell's residents know that a CO was in the wing searching. I kept an eye on that cell, and after about 5 minutes I decided to radio Jacobs and tell him to hit that cell next. Before I had the chance, Jacobs walked out of 6 and started heading straight for 9. Now, this is where it got a bit messy. I saw 2 or 3 offenders walking quickly away from the cell as Jacobs walked up, and about a minute later, Jacobs was escorting the cell's 2 occupants out of the wing, through the lobby, and into the office.\n\n\n\nI was pretty confused at this point, and stayed that way for the next 45 minutes or so until the offenders went back to the wing and Jacobs finally came back. He walked into the bubble shaking his head. \"You just can't make this stuff up,\" he laughed. What even happened in there?\" I asked him. I was honestly at a loss for words (mainly because I was laughing too hard to speak) when he told me the story. \n\n\n\nWhen Jacobs walked up to 9, one of the cell's residents, we'll call him Offender Davis, threw something into his mouth and quickly swallowed it. Of course, Jacobs immediately thought it was drugs. He was about to call for immediate assistance and pulled his pepper spray out, but decided to ask Davis what he swallowed first. \"I didn't swallow nothing, man!\" Davis said. It was at this point that Jacobs noticed that Davis' teeth seemed to be covered in some kind of black substance. Jacobs was slightly confused by this, and directed him to open his mouth. Sure enough, Davis' teeth and tongue were completely covered in black. \"What is that?\" Jacobs asked. Davis, of course, continued stating that he had no idea was Jacobs was talking about. \n\n\n\nJacobs then turned and looked to Davis' cellie, who was still sitting on the bunk, for some answers. He didn't even have to ask- the fresh, still bleeding tattoo on his leg said it all. Davis had been giving his cellie a tattoo and, when they were about to get busted by Jacobs, he decided to \"dispose\" of the evidence by swallowing the ink well with ink still in it. These ink wells are made using half a bar of soap with a small indent carved out to hold the ink. One of the offenders who had run out of the cell prior to Jacob's entry had grabbed the tattoo gun, leaving Davis to get rid of the rest. \n\n\n\n\nNow, most offenders would have just been happy that the gun was gone, as it's more difficult for a CO to write a violation for tattooing if there's no tattoo gun actually recovered. The other stuff is still tattoo paraphernalia, but it's not as important. I say this because I want to stress that offenders swallowing any type of contraband other than drugs is NOT a normal occurrence. Tattooing is taken seriously and will get you in trouble, but getting caught certainly isn't the end of the world. Essentially, Offender Davis swallowed a bar of soap filled with some nasty ink to avoid a somewhat minor violation. \n\n\n\nLong story short, Davis was genuinely surprised that his stomach started hurting about 15 minutes after the whole ordeal began. He wound up spending the night in medical for observation. He was even more surprised to find that his efforts to avoid a violation didn't pay off, since it's definitely not a smart idea to throw something in your mouth and swallow it right in front of a CO who's about to search your cell, and he obviously got a write up for doing so.\n\n\n\nIn true offender fashion, Davis failed to learn his lesson. Most offenders would probably give it a rest for at least a few days, but I caught Davis carving out another ink well last night while I was doing a wing check. I opened his door and said, \"Davis, I figured after the other night you wouldn't even want to see any more soap for a while.\" He stared blankly at me for a moment before quietly laughing, \"Ah, yeah, that was pretty rough!\" \n\n\n\nAll in all, Davis got a write up worse than what he would have originally gotten for the tattoo paraphernalia, a stomachache from hell, and a free night's stay in a medical observation cell. Once the violation goes through within the next few days, he'll likely be spending a good amount of time in the hole. Moral of the story here: Eating the evidence just isn't worth it!\n\n\n",

I like this guy - he's pretty much no fluff, no BS, to the point, but isn't crotchety.\n\nDispatched to major accident. Beat Fire and EMS. Friendly wrecker has roadway blocked. I stay in the car, the officer starts attending to the injured driver. Hear honking and the wrecker driving yelling at the officer 'He's trying to get through', pointing at uninvolved car who had now moved into the oncoming lanes of traffic. Officer yells at car 'Stop honking or go to jail' and turns his attention back to the injured party. Guy rolls down his window and starts yelling at the officer how he wanted to get through. Officer yells back 'Turn the fuck around'. Guy stops yelling, turns around, situation handled, officer continues to administer aid to injured party until fire shows up. \n\nWrapping up the accident, we get a message on our computer saying that the uninvolved party called to complain. Officer calls dispatch to see what the guy said. The guy told the Sgt. that he was 'in fear of his life' because the cop had a gun and swore at him and then went on a tirade about race. Told the officer that if his Sgt. needs a witness statement, I'm happy to provide one but the entitled idiot was obvious incapable of listening to pleasantries. Not sure how y'all put up with that crap. ",

        "text": "Just found this subreddit and I thought I'd share a story.\n\nI live a nocturnal lifestyle and sometimes go on walks at night around my area. One night last year I was walking down the highway when I hear a sound that I never heard before. Sounds like some sort of rapid beeping coming from a business nearby. I think nothing of it and turn onto a road that leads further into the countryside. It wasn't until I thought a little more about it that I realized perhaps it was an alarm of some sort.\n\nI'm about half a mile down the next road when suddenly I'm being illuminated by a bright light from behind me. I thought at first it was just a car approaching me but like always they'll simply pass me. It wasn't until I saw the flashing red and blue lights that I realized it was a cop. I then heard somebody yell \"Stop and get down on your knees!\" I obliged out of instinct and the next thing I know I'm being arrested as a burglary suspect. \n\nAfter searching my person (carrying nothing with me except my cell phone and earbuds) they found nothing to indicate that I had burglarized what turned out to be the dollar store. I was in their custody for a few minutes before they released me and apologized, stating that I merely matched the description of a burglary suspect that they had received from a witness earlier in the night. It turned out that the dollar store wasn't the only business to be hit that night.\n\nIt may have been an unnerving, anxious experience but I hold no ill will towards the state trooper who was merely doing his job. This day in age most people would hate the guts of a cop for doing that and would probably look to sue them but they were just doing their job and I have and always will respect them for doing so. I know I wouldn't ever want to be a cop, but someone has to do it and I applaud them for doing so.\n\n",

        "text": "I developed a rule for myself after a lot of experience regarding traffic violations: I'm always right. Hear me out. Because of how busy my area is, I usually make 10 or so traffic stops a day, and only for the most blatant violations. Once I go and talk to the driver, they'll often comment how it was an honest mistake, it wasn't a big deal, or it wasn't that bad. That's understandable since no one wants a ticket. And then when I write them a ticket anyway, I go back and review my dashcam footage and see it was *that* bad, it's *always* that bad, otherwise I wouldn't have made the stop. So my rule came down to trusting myself instead of the person trying to avoid getting in trouble.\n\nI was sitting at a [metered on-ramp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramp_meter) behind a long line of cars that was moving slowly due to a slow meter. We inched our way forward until I was two cars from the metered light. I watched as the light turned from red to green, and the lead car went. The second car followed with no pause. He clearly went straight through the red light, not waiting for a green. So I pulled him over.\n\n\"Good afternoon, sir. I stopped you for ignoring that metering light.\"\n\n\"That one? Oh no, it was green. I waited for it to turn green.\"\n\n\"All I saw was red. I'll need to see your driver's license. registration, and insurance.\" He provided it all.\n\nHis paperwork was in order, his license was valid, and he wasn't evasive. It certainly seemed like *he* thought he was telling the truth. I had also glanced away for a split second to change the radio on my patrol car when he took off from that light, so I only saw him fail to stop out of my peripheral vision.\n\nI checked my dash camera footage, which constantly records, and allows me to play back video before I had turned my lights on. The video showed the light was red, turned green quickly, and turned red. During this time the car I stopped moved forward to the front of the line. The light then quickly turned green again, and quickly back to red, making it so the car I stopped never had to slow down. He went on a green.\n\nI walked back up to the driver. \"Here's your information back, sir. I just reviewed my dash cam footage, and you were correct. The light was green. I apologize for the inconvenience. Drive safe.\"\n\nSometimes I'm wrong.",

        "text": "So to premise this, I'm in the military. I asked a co-worker to give me a ride home after training one day (both in uniform). Co-worker is married to someone in Security Forces. Also, I live in a semi crime ridden neighborhood.\n\nSo I don't live far from base, and I asked for a ride home, obviously. I'm a little out of her way, but knew she wouldn't mind. She is driving down my my main road, and I noticed that there seemed to be an abundance of cops on the road. In the mile or two that we drove, I saw a few either driving by or parked. I didn't say anything because... I mean she's married to SF, I don't want to be condescending.\n\nAt this point I was watching, wondering if something was going on. We come up on stop sign and I see another police car parked under a sign.  You can see the the bottom of the car, not the top. Well she drives by and sure enough, flashing lights behind her. \n\nI am feeling terrible. She is doing a good deed for me and getting a ticket for it. I'm already thinking about if I have the finances to pay for the ticket.\n\nSo she pulls over. What does she do? She immediately takes her seat belt off and starts reaching into the backseat. I'm like co-worker? What are you doing?! She said her license was in the backseat and she needed to get it. I'm like uhhh..... you really shouldn't take off your seat belt before the cop comes to talk to you, and definitely don't go reaching in the backseat!! She nods and is like yeah, that makes sense, AND CONTINUES GETTING HER STUFF FROM THE BACK SEAT. \n\nSo I'm sitting in the passenger seat, looking very ashamed. I figure everyone knows these rules! Especially someone who is married to someone in the law enforcement career field?!\n\nWell, on top of everything else, her window doesn't roll down. What does she do??? Before the officer even gets out of his vehicle SHE STEPS OUT AND STARTS WALKING TO HIM. I can't even stop her at this point. \n\nThe officer walks up, and asks her to get back in her vehicle. She explains her window won't roll down. He's understanding. He asks for license/registration/insurance. She hands him her license, explains it's her husband's vehicle, and starts digging through the glove box. I eventually find her stuff,  and give it to the officer. I look out my window (that is rolled down) and see another officer standing there, smiling.\n\nHis smiling doesn't fit the tone that has been set so far (in my mind at least). I ask him if he needs my ID, and he just says no. But continues smiling in the vehicle? I'm utterly confused at this point.\n\nThe other officer walks back up. He it's very somber and says that he pulled her over for speeding. She apologizes said she didn't know she was, etc.\n\nHe says that he was going to write her a ticket but it is her lucky day because they're giving out GIFTCARDS TO THE COMMUNITY and hands her a $25 Walmart GC.\n\nShe breaks down into tears and thanks them, barely even able to talk. I smile and am grateful this whole thing didn't turn out into a ticket that I felt obligated to cover, or worse! \n\nSo, the next day, she tells everyone how she got a giftcard. I said hold on a minute, and told everyone the specifics. Turns into a whole white/black thing, but she literally had NO IDEA that she did anything wrong! I told her she needed to talk to her husband about proper procedures when getting pulled over.\n\nSo anyways, she told her parents about the incident, and her mom yelled at her about how \"she was going to get shot\" and her husband listened to the convo shaking his head at her.\n\nAnyways! Thought it was a funny story and wanted to share. Y'all are awesome, and I appreciate your service every day!",

        "text": "My group of friends in high school had a great passion for causing trouble throughout our youth. On any given weekend, we could be found dragging a port-a-potty behind my truck, finding old couches &amp; loading them into the back and tossing them out at about 80mph, and just general dipshit [shenanigans](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JNPW2wZ4D2s/maxresdefault.jpg). One evening in the midst of a calmer night on the town, we had decided to hit the drive thru of a local taco joint. We had two vehicles, so rather than go through the drive thru behind them and risk them leaving me behind, I pulled up real close and handed them some cash and told them to order me a burrito and waited next to them. Sure as shit, when they get the food they bolt down the road. So I come flying out of the parking lot hot in pursuit of that tasty burrito. I thought I was a real hot shot back then, so I catch up to them and pull up as close as I can, screaming burrito related obscenities and trying to scare them. They dig through the bag and pretend like they are going to hand me my food, so as i'm driving, I hop up and am sitting on my window sill leaning over towards their vehicle. As I go to reach for the food, they let it go, those tricky fucks, it was just a wrapper! They get their laugh, then hand me the real food and I hop back down into my seat, look in the rear view mirror and about shit my pants harder than that burrito ever could've made me, a squad car with a fresh burrito wrapper stuck to the grill is pulled up right behind me, right as I get that feeling they somehow didn't see anything, the cherries come on. OH FUCK.\n\nThe formalities of \"license &amp; registration\" are replaced with \"What in the fuck do you guys think you are doing?!?\". My buddy driving the other car goes back into the squad car first and I can see him in my rear view mirror, and he is getting grilled, and the officer is getting redder by the minute. Next, she comes up to my window and tells me to step back to her car. As I work through the aforementioned story, her exasperated demeanor slowly starts to fade and at the point where I said I sat back down and saw her car with the wrapper on the front she actually laughs. As I step back out, another officer has arrived on the scene and stands at the front of her car and they begin discussing the situation, and at one point he even cracks a smile. As they finish up their discussion, he looks at me, now holding my bounty and says \"Whats in the bag?\", with a shit eating grin, so I reply \"A burrito. Do you want it?\" Both officers crack up laughing harder than hell, and i'm just standing there in shock. Long story short, she sat me back down in her car, rallied off the list of infractions she could give me amounting to about $800, and then LETS ME FREAKING GO with a warning. \n\nSorry this got rushed at the end, I gotta get to a meeting. Hope you guys like my first submission! ",

        "text": "Hey all, after reading the posts here for most of the day, I've decided to share with you all one of the stories of my time working in what can be considered a county jail. I was there for 3 years, and left a little over a year ago. Although I wasn't there for very long, some of the things I saw there messed me up pretty good. I'm still dealing with a lot of it, and was told recently by a social worker that works with military vets that I may have PTSD. I'm considering seeing someone, but that's another story for another time. However, today's story isn't one of those, but it did give me a good idea on what my time at the jail was going to be like. Throwaway for reasons. Names will be changed. I hope to write more stories and get a lot of what happened off my chest.\n\nThe jail I worked at literally hired anyone. I found out at one point that one of my Lieutenants was a former sex offender. Me personally, my previous work experience was installs for one of the two big satellite television companies. I didn't even get any formal training until I had been there for 6 months. I don't know how it works in most jails around the country, but I walked into work with a radio and a good luck pat on the back. \n\nI arrive for my first shift, obviously nervous about how things were going to work. I had never done this kind of thing before, hell, I had never even fought anyone before. I can honestly say I didn't take this job for any \"honorable\" reason. I needed money, they needed officers, that easy. \n\nMy Captain on shift walks with me inside, and shows me the holding cell area. After a brief explanation on what it's for and that it's where we send inmates for \"the hole\", he walks me through the gate into general population. Brings me to what is known as \"Front Desk\" sits me down, hands me the keys, and walks away. That's it.\n\nAt first, looking back on it, I was way more fucked than I initially thought. Let me give you a quick breakdown. Front Desk consisted of A-Dorm, B-Dorm, and Sick Bay. A-Dorm was a standard general population dorm, which held 96 inmates. B-Dorm was one of the trustee dorms, and held 36. Sick bay, well, that's obvious. It held 12. It also had the security office in it, which is where my supervisors smoked cigarettes and drank coffee all night, the nurse's station, and a one man cell behind the security office. I was in charge of 3 doors, and one gate. I had no idea what key went to what door, no idea what I was supposed to do with the log book in front of me, and no idea what my radio number was. I quickly found out when the Holding Cell officer called me a \"retard\" for not answering him. \n\nIt's been about an hour at this point, and I'm still just sitting at the desk. A-Dorm has a big window in it so you can see inside, and I've just been watching the inmates. At this point they haven't realized that there's fresh meat sitting there, thankfully. All of a sudden, a trustee walks out of B-Dorm. I was a little surprised the door was open, but figured since I obviously hadn't opened it, it was supposed to be open.\n\n\"What's up Sarge, you new?\"\n\nIt was a young white guy, probably around 25, who introduced himself as Wes. Wes tells me he's the hallworker, which in his words meant \"I'm the fucking janitor, bitch!\" He was a good guy, made a simple mistake and was doing the time for it. I talk with him for a minuite and he looks down at my log book. \n\n\"Man, you ain't even filled out your book yet?\"\n\n\"Nobody mentioned it to me. Captain just sat me down here and left.\"\n\n\"Yeah, the old man gets so caught up in other shit. Here, let me show you how to do it.\"\n\nYes, not only did Wes know how to fill in the log book, he showed me how it was done. He sat with me even more, and ended up telling me more about the job than any officer ever did. What to watch for, what to say, what not to say, etc.\n\nI've been at work for about 2 hours now, pretty much bullshitting with Wes at this point, when Shaggy walks up to me. Shaggy was the floor Sergeant, which as it turns out, isn't an actual rank. If the shift had enough people, the Sergeant would pick out a floor Sergeant, who would basically do all the Sergeants work for the night. Better than sitting at a drop all night, that's for sure. So Shaggy walks up and is surprised my book is started. I told him that I had just looked at previous entries and figured it out. He seems happy with that answer. With Wes smirking in the background, Shaggy tells me he wants to walk me through A-Dorm. Well, shit. Had to happen sooner or later.\n\nOne of the things Wes told me was, \"Never let anyone try to get over on you. Put your foot down. While they're in here, you're the law. Show them that.\" I had no idea I would be using that advice so soon though.\n\nWalking into A-Dorm for the first time was an experience I still haven't fully forgotten. I can honestly say it felt like walking into another world. The tension in the air, feeling that many eyes on me at once, it was surreal. The lions thought a sheep had just walked into their den.\n\nThought.\n\n\"EVERBODY, ON YOUR BUNKS\" \n\nSlowly but surely, all the inmates made their way to their respective bunks and sat down. Shaggy gave me a quick lesson one what we were doing, a head count. He told me just to follow him and count along. We start walking, and the inmates decide to have fun. Whistling, talking about the \"cute new guard\" who just came in, etc. I am a man, btw, and I knew this was all to test me, so I let it go. I get about halfway down the dorm and I hear from the other side of the dorm,\n\n\"Hey, Shaggy, leave the fresh meat with me. He can share my bunk tonight!\" \n\nThe whole dorm starts laughing, and I decide, fuck that. I walk over to that side of the dorm.\n\n\"Who the fuck said that?\"\n\nSilence. You could hear a pin drop. \n\n\"Oh, what, scared now? Don't want your buddies to know you want to fuck a man?\"\n\nI hear a few people start to laugh.\n\n\"Come on, be a man. Tell everybody how much you want to fuck a man\"\n\nAt that point Shaggy tells me to go start counting B-Dorm. I was later told by an inmate in A-Dorm that I gained a little respect from them. Slowly over time, A-Dorm quickly became \"my\" dorm. I worked Front Desk so much, I knew every detail about that dorm. To this day I could probably show you where the paint was chipped if I really wanted to. I knew every inmate by name, and most of them conveniently only had problems when I was there. A lot of them told me honestly, that they only liked dealing with me because I treated them like humans. Most of the other officers that I worked with over time, I can only describe as \"Robo-Cops\" and people who desperately got a hard on from being in control of somebody.\n\nIt's about halfway through my 12 hour shift, and I'm struggling badly to stay awake. Night shift is not something I was ever used to, and it was rough. The gate at Front Desk led into the Lockdown hallway. Which was five 15 man cells, one 8 man cell, and the laundry room. Lockdown had two gates. One in the middle of the hall on the right, which led to the Chow hall, and one at the end, Back Keys, which consisted of C, D, E dorm, and the camera room. The laundry room is right behind Front desk gate. One of they laundry men, Terry, tells me he needs to get through the gate. He says he wants to talk to the Lieutenant, who I'll affectionately refer to as Meathead from this point forward. I clear it with Lt. Meathead, and let Terry through. \n\nHe wasn't in there for 5 minutes before Capt. B, Lt. Meathead, and Sgt. MiniMeathead (who I'll just call Mini) runs up to the gate and says to let them through. I do, and they run into the Laundry room. I close the gate, and a few minutes later, they open the gate, (yeah, they had keys), and all walk out with Shaggy in tow. They go up to the holding cell area, and I hear the door open that leads to the lobby outside. Shortly after, they walk back in, minus Shaggy. Sgt. Mini comes up to me and tells me to had over my keys, and go help out Old Man in the Holding Cell area. \n\nI go, and Old Man, who remember called me a retard earlier that night, gives me half of his keys, which only open the gates leading towards the sally-port, where officers bring in arrests, and the bird cages, which are three one man cells. He gives me a quick run-down on how the holding cell area works, and right around the time that he's finishing, Lt. Meathead comes up with Terry and the other Laundry man to the gate. \n\n\"CO1044, put these two in cuffs and put them in the birdcage. When you get done, get back on front desk. Log them out of B-Dorm, and come in the office.\"\n\nI do what I'm told, and leave Old Man to grumble to himself about how they could have left him some help up there. I don't blame him. I wouldn't end up working Holding Cell for another two years or so, and I understood that it was HELL. Worst drop in the jail. Old Man was tough as brick though. I watched this 60 year old single handedly take down a 6' 4\" 400lb man fucked up on legal marijuana, all without dropping the cigarette in his mouth.\n\nI catch up on what I need to do, and go inside the security office. Now Captain B, took less shit than any man I've ever seen. Tougher than Old Man, when that foot started stomping, you better run boy. I've seen murderers beg Capt. B not to hurt them, and he was pushing 75 years old. Ever see someone throw a radio like a tomahawk? It's great. \n\nFor some reason, when we first met, Capt. B HATED me, but so did Lt. Meathead and Sgt. Mini. Those two just hated me because they thought I was gay, for some reason, and eventually got me on day shift because of that. Capt. B, he just thought I was a pussy that would never make it. When I left the jail, I left as a Sergeant, and me and Cap became so close I saw him as another grandfather.\n\nAnyway, I walk in and Cap tells me to light a cigarette and hang out for a minute. I light one with him, and lean against the desk.\n\n\"Do you have any idea what the fuck just happened?\"\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you. And it's gonna make you reconsider this whole job. If you don't quit soon, just know that what just happened is only the tip of the iceberg of what you'll see here.\"\n\nTo keep things simple, since this post is passing 10,000 characters, I'll just put it to you like this.\n\nTerry wanted to let the supervisors know that Shaggy had gone into the Laundry room to \"pleasure\" the other laundry worker. With his mouth.\n\nCap was kind of right. It wasn't the tip of an iceberg, it was the tip of an entire damn mountain.",

        "text": "TL;DR Go camping with some friends. Farmer who is leasing the land accuses us of destroying his crops, tries to get us thrown in jail, and demands we pay him 5 grand. Cops show up, determine we are allowed to be there, and IF any damage has been done, the alleged amount was not worth their trouble. Nothing happens to us, cops leave, and farmer is told to go home leave us alone.\n\nBuckle up. Wall of text ahead.\n\nMy friends and I enjoy going camping every now and then to get away from it all and have a good time outdoors. This particular time, one friend (referred to as B from here) got permission from his fiancée's uncle to camp on his multi-acre property for a weekend. He gives us a spot where we can be and doesn't really gives us any rules other than \"don't be stupid\". Everyone but me shows up on the Friday of that weekend. I had things going on that prevented me from showing up til Saturday night.\n\nAn important detail - apparently during the day on Saturday, B gets the idea to do some mudding. Nobody shoots the idea down and we were never told not to, so mudding occurs. More on that later.\n\nAs I pull into the place on Saturday, B meets me at the property's gate to let me in. Since it had been raining off and on during the last 2 days, there was a lot of mud to get through before getting past the gate. Unfortunately, this resulted in me getting the SUV I had borrowed stuck in the mud.\n\nThe SUV was an 06' Ford Explorer and had some kind of anti-slipping mechanic on it that prevented the truck's tires from spinning too much. Since I didn't know the truck had this mechanic, me and B were fucking with trying to get out for way too long before I even realized the function existed.\n\nAnyways, we're dealing with this for about 10 minutes, trying to put various things under the tires and such, before another unknown truck pulls up, points it's lights at us, and just sits there. Since it was already dark, we couldn't see anything other than the outline of the truck and it's headlights. Me and B stare at it for a bit, see nothing, then proceed with our business.\n\n5 minutes later, a guy gets out of the truck and walks a bit towards us. He makes sure to stay in the headlights to make sure we could only see his outline (I guess as some stupid scare tactic?). We'll call this guy Stupid Farm Hand (SFH).\n\nSFH - WHAT'RE Y'ALL DOING HERE?!\n\nMe and B (MaB)- uhh....trying to get out of the mud?\n\nSFH - Y'ALL TRESPASSING!\n\nMaB - ....no. We know the owner of this property and we have his permission to be here\n\nSFH - I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FOR A MINUTE! I HEAR YOU BOYS HAVE BEEN DOING SOME DAMAGE OUT HERE TOO! YOU BOYS ARE FUCKED! I HOPE YOU GUYS HAVE $37,000 DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA NEED AT LEAST THAT WHEN YOU GET OUT OF JAIL!\n\nSFH then proceeds to get in his truck and speed off. Me and B go back to our business, confident in the fact that, should any problems happen, we can get a hold of the owner and sort everything out. Turns out that's exactly what we'd have to do.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after SFH leaves, another truck shows up, parks, and points it's headlights at us like the last one. We look at the truck for a bit, nothing happens, and we go about our business. Turns this guy was calling the cops while he was just sitting in his truck. Eventually, he gets out and approaches me and B. This guy gets close enough to where we can see his and properly interact with him. We'll call this guy the farmer (F).\n\nF - What're you boys doing out here?\n\nMaB - Camping\n\nF - And who said you could do that?\n\nMaB - ...The guy who owns this place. Why?\n\nF - Well I find that hard to believe seeing as how I'm the one who owns this land.\n\nB - Well you're not (owner's name) so how do you see that?\n\nF - I farm on this land and I have been for X years! You boys are trespassing and have I heard about you tearing up my crops. You're all going to jail and this car (points at my car) and ALL these other cars are getting impounded! (We had parked all our cars at the gates and walked to the camp site nearby)\n\nMe - None of that is happening. We're supposed to be here.\n\nF leaves in a huff and chills in his car before we say anything.\n\nI'm going to summarize the rest because it took place over about an hour and a half, this happened a several years ago, and this post is already long as fuck.  It's also important to note that we were never told anything about the land being leased out to someone or being used for farming.  So as far as we knew, this was some crazy guy making shit up and trying to get us thrown in jail.\n\nCops show up a few minutes later and start taking statements. The whole time we're trying to get the land owner and he isn't answering. Fucking great. We can't hear too much of what F is saying but we get the rest of the details later from various sources.  Here's his side of the story.\n\nApparently, one of F's neighbors saw B and the guys mudding and called F to tell him that there were some delinquents out on his land who had destroyed his crops. F claimed the total damage to his property was at least $5,000 and demanded we get thrown in jail and such.\n\nThen the cops then get our side of the story.  To recap, we were given permission by the owner to camp there over the weekend and didn't know anything about the crops.  Next, they do a quick damage assessment of the crops. They can't do the best assessment, since it's dark, but they determine that the crops definitely aren't destroyed and that any damage, even if it was the full $5K, wasn't enough for them to deal with and would have to be settled in civil court. By that time, we are able to get a hold of the owner. That's when we find out that F is actually just leasing the land from the owner for farming purposes and doesn't have as much say as he thinks. The cops talk to the owner and then tell F what we've been telling him all along.\n\nCops - Sir, these boys have permission from the property owner to be here. They are not trespassing. And they have not done any real visible damage to your crops that we can see to justify taking them or any of their cars in. I suggest you go home and let them be. You'll have to take this up with them and the owner in civil court. Have a good night.\n\nThe look on F's face at that moment was priceless and worth the whole ordeal.\n\nWe go back to our campsite and try to enjoy the rest of the night. We determined, with the owner, that would be the best plan at the moment but that we should get off the property as early as possible in the morning and to try to not fuck anything else up.\n\nAfter leaving, the owner calls and says that the actual damage was almost ~~immeasurable~~ negligible and the guy was throwing a fit over pretty much nothing. LOL\n\nAll in all, I get why F was mad but the way he went about trying to deal with it was pretty insane.\n\nHope you enjoyed the read.\n",

        "text": "Hi all. Long time lurker, first time poster. One night, I had gotten off work and was headed to the corner store for some snacks. It was Saturday night, so time to relax. On the way back, I heard a loud crash about 50 yards in front. There was a railroad trestle between me and the sound, so I quickened my pace to see what happened. \nSure enough, there's a middle aged woman on the sidewalk who had just crashed into the curb. After lifting the scooter she was on out of the road, I realized she was intoxicated. The campus police (I was in college at the time) show up a moment later and start figuring out what happened. After the whole song and dance of carting drunk woman off to the big house, they took down my address and my contact info in case they needed to investigate. \nFast forward five months. My parents get a subpoena in the mail addressed to me. Seeing as I had never been in trouble, they were panicked. I, holding back laughter, recounted the night to my folks. The solicitor asked me the same questions the police did; never did testify. \nI discovered a few years later while clicking around online that she had received her fourth DUI that night. She had received the works (28 weekends, house arrest, complete revocation of license, etc). Still blows my mind that people would just not learn. \nTL;DR don't drink and drive. If you do, don't do it again. ",

        "text": "This happened about 9 years ago. I worked in a city that was 30 miles away from where I lived and my shift typically ended around 10 or 11 pm. The drive home has plenty of leisurely drivers who are in no hurry to get anywhere. It's a nuisance, but whatever. \n\nThis night, however, I could feel my blood sugar dropping and I wanted to get home as soon as possible to fix that. The truck in front of me unfortunately was one of those slow drivers and even though I wasn't tailgating, he must have thought that I was. (Maybe my lights were too bright for him in the middle of the night on a dark country road, I don't really know.) He began to drive even slower, around 35-40 mph in a 55. We finally reach a dotted yellow which would allow me to pass, so I move my car over to check to make sure the lane was clear. It wasn't, so I missed my opportunity then. Oh well, there's a truck lane a mile or so ahead. When we get there, I move to pass him, but he wanted to play around and speed up so I couldn't, so I did the only logical thing and floored it. Much to my chagrin, there's flashing blue lights in my rear view mirror. Well crap. \n\nThe officer approached my car and asked the routine questions before stating he pulled me over because he thought I was drunk. He was the oncoming vehicle when I checked to see if I could pass the truck. I explain to him that I'm a type 1 diabetic and I just needed to get home because my sugar was low. After I denied a request for an ambulance, he takes my credentials back to his car. \n\nAt this point I'm feeling light headed, so when he returns to my vehicle I have a bit of trouble understanding him. At first I thought he was asking for my kid-which I don't have one, so you can understand my confusion-but he was actually asking if I had my kit on me. I said I didn't and he responded by telling me that I should carry my medicine on me. I then explain that I don't need my medicine, but something with carbohydrates. It was then that he made an expression like he suddenly understood and had an idea. \"I have some energy drink mix in my trunk, will that work?\" If it had sugar in it, yes it would. So he grabbed it while I grabbed a bottle of water from my trunk and mixed it all together. I chugged it like I've never chugged anything before. He warned me to just be careful while driving before he took off again. I sat in my car for a few moments before going home. \n\nOverall, one of my best interactions with a police officer. ",

        "text": "I was merging onto a freeway with a posted 55mph limit, while directly behind one other car, after just taking off from a red light. The freeway had light traffic, the on-ramp was about 1/4 mile long and completely flat, and there were no obstructions in sight. Fun fact: the speed limit on an on-ramp is the same as the speed limit on the freeway (unless otherwise posted).\n\nSo it was a bit frustrating as we were barely gaining any speed. Halfway through the ramp, we were doing 20mph and things weren't looking good. We finally reached the edge of the ramp, merged onto the freeway, and hit a blazing 35mph. It was a modern car, less than 5 years old, so there wasn't any question about the car's capability.\n\nOnce we were on, the speedster in front of me made a lane change from the slow lane, to the left one lane, with no turn signal, while cutting another car off that was actually going the speed limit.\n\nWhoop whoop, that's the sound of the police.\n\nI contacted the driver, an elderly male. \"Good afternoon, sir. I stopped you for a few reasons. The first was merging onto the freeway too slowly; we were doing 35mph when we got on. The second was not signaling your lane change, cutting off the vehicle on your left. And the third is that it appears your entire left tail light is broken, and that may be why I didn't see any signal.\" When he came to a stop, I didn't see any of his car's left tail lights light up. It made me think the whole assembly was disconnected.\n\nThe driver went through how he definitely used his signal, because he always signals. Maybe, maybe not. He also explained how he \"usually gets on it,\" implying speeds up quickly, but was a little lost...even though we were in the city he lived in.\n\nI checked his driving history and found no records of crashes or tickets. Sometimes that works in a driver's favor, and sometimes it works against them. It depends on what I've stopped them for. In this guy's case, it worked for him. He was given a warning, instructed to fix his tail light, and told to merge onto the freeway at the same speed as traffic.\n\nWhen merging back into traffic after I released him, he went a little faster.\n\n \n\n\n",

        "text": "First Reddit post, hopefully formatting is ok.\n\nThis happened in 2004, when I was 17. My first car was a 1985 BMW 528i. Her name was Bernadette or Bernie for short. I loved that car.\n\nBernie &amp; I were on our way to the ATM on this night, to see if I had been paid yet (no internet banking then). We were sitting at the lights when some guy pulls up alongside in his Toyota Echo, he claimed his gutless piece of shit car could beat Bernie! I laughed of course and thought he was joking. \n\nThe lights went green, I accelerated as normal, not to the floor or anything. Just a little acceleration in my 2.8L engine of course beat the 1.3L engine which sounded like he was giving it everything he could while I cruised along. I gave it a little more gas to get ahead of him so his annoying whining engine wasn’t in my ears anymore. \n\nI then saw a car indicating to turn from my lane up ahead so I let my foot off the gas to coast in hopes the car ahead had turned without me having to brake. Mr Echo took this as an opportunity to cut me off by swerving into my right hand lane mere inches from my front bumper. I stayed right on his arse (again, I was 17 – no one is that bright at that age!). \n\nFurther up ahead a cop neither of us had seen ran out into the middle of the road, gesturing for us both to pull over.\n\nThe Officer went to his window first; I’m not sure what was said. She then came to my window &amp; asked for my licence etc. which I provided. She asked how fast I was going, I kept saying I was doing 60 km/hr – I think I was probably doing around 90 but it seemed like a good idea to say 60. She mentioned she had gotten him on the radar, hadn’t actually gotten my car but being that I remained on his arse the 300m or so it took for us to get up to her and see she was instructing us to pull over, it was a safe assumption I was doing the same speed. I answered the rest of her questions honestly &amp; politely &amp; had all documents she wanted. I was happy for her to look at my car too whereas the other guy was protesting at that. Who knows why, it was just a shitty Echo. Plus I’m fairly certain I heard every possible cuss word used at the officer who was just doing her job.\n\nAfter around 20 minutes of back and forth between our cars, she hands me my licence back. I was expecting a fine and was mentally preparing for how to tell my dad. I have never forgotten her words “Here’s your licence. He looks like an idiot but you don’t. Just a pointer for next time, the speed limit along here is 70 not 60”.  I thanked the officer and carried on my way to the ATM.\n\nWhat would you know?! Echo boy was also going to the same ATM. He pulled in a couple of minutes behind me. I was still waiting for the machine to be free. He came up &amp; asked how much in fines I got. He had a bit of a tantrum when I told him nothing. Apparently he had over $800 in fines. I smiled &amp; said “obviously you look like an idiot and I don’t”. I got back in my car &amp; headed home. At 70 km/hr max the whole way home! \n",

        "text": "EDIT: Just gonna start off with a key really quick:\n\nCode 3 - Units respond immediately with lights and sirens\n\nCode 33- emergency situation- priority radio traffic only and a beeper is heard over the radio to let people know something's up\n\nCode 34- return to normal radio traffic, everything is fine\n\nCode 4- everything is fine\n\n\nSo this just happened about an hour ago. I'm sitting in my driveway currently. It's around 0245 right now and I want to type this out before I forget anything. Apologies if the flow is odd, I'm pretty tired.\n\nI'm the Explorer Captain for a neighboring city's PD, and have been in the post for a few years. We are fully uniformed with body armor so we are able to get involved with calls when warranted. Utilizing a program through my school I've been able to get released early to ride 1-2 times a week. As such I have triple digit hours in the squad car, which has enough stories on its own but this is a first. \n\nWe were covering another unit on a traffic stop with multiple individuals occupying the vehicle, so we were preparing to start running names.\n\nI overhear that a David unit announced a suspicious occupied vehicle, and gave the plate for dispatch to run.  \n\nNot the first of the night, I thought to myself. \n\nDispatch returns with the plate; clear current out of xxxx city. No response from either officer.\n\nNow there's always the times when dispatch tries to raise an Officer and they don't respond for whatever reason, be it too much background noise, accidentally turned their radio down, etc. Usually it ends with a slightly embarrassed response if it took many tries or if Code 33 was put out due to inability to raise them. Before that response however there is always that little sliver of \"is something wrong\"\n\nAnyways back to the call.\n\nStill no response. Sergeant asks radio to hail again. No response. Tones go out. I get the little feeling in the pit of my stomach that stirs the doubt. \n\nFinally: *garbled* \"Fighting with one\" *garbled*\n\nThe officers and I freeze. Dispatch starts to respond but are cut off by:\n\n\"Send cover units Code 3\"\n\nWe break from the call. The 5 occupants look at us, confused. We aren't really thinking of them right now. \n\nWe pull away and start slamming across the city, throwing lights on to quickly check out and then blast through red lights and stop signs. No traffic since it's so early in the morning.\n\nSergeant is instructing units while we are getting up to doing 95 on the freeway. \n\nThen, the officer and I both hear it. \n\n\"We have an Injured officer\"\n\nDispatch responds they are starting medical\n\nWe the officer and I look at each other and with a resounding \"oh fuck\" continue blazing down the freeway. \n\nThen, finally, I hear units announcing they are on scene. Then the announcements of detainment, and the recovery of a gun. We have slowed down but are ¾ the way there. \n\nSergeant advises it's a minor injury. Sigh of relief. \n\nLooking at the board, it looks like they have enough units there so we stop heading towards the scene.  \n\nSergeant advises Code 4, Code 34. We are by the station so I decide to call it a night.\n\nAnyway I figure I'd share. That's the first time I've been riding when an Officer went hands on. Like I said there is always that little feeling when nobody responds, but 9/10 times it's nothing. There's always that little possibility though. I will definitely be keeping this experience in mind for future reference.\n\nAlso, first post here. I have tons of stories to share, just gotta find time to type them out. Hope you guys found this interesting.\n\n",

        "text": "Just a short one from last year.  For context I'm a Special Constable, which is a part-time, unpaid volunteer officer employed by a UK territorial police service who has full Constabulary powers (though whether money was expended to train and certify us to use them is another matter...).\n\nI personally enjoy and seek out the 1600-0300 shifts on Friday and Saturday evenings to volunteer my time on because I enjoy working in that environment, keeping revellers safe on the 2300-0230 nightsafe operation, and as a student I know what can happen when you go out out.  Unfortunately I've missed the first half of the nightsafe because my partner and I lifted a man with medical issues and had to sit with him in the hospital for five hours.  So, at 0140 we leave the station and start walking to the city centreto do some foot patrol.  At 0150 I check my watch and write in my pocket note book 'arrived nightsafe, reporting to sgt,' and wander over to see where he wants us to go.\n\nAs I report to him, a bouncer drags a man over, saying he didn't want to be searched to enter the club.  Naturally we just look at the bouncer.  'Okay then?'  No one said it, but the prevailing thought is 'so what?  He doesn't have to be searched, he can find another club with different conditions of entry.  We don't have a power to search him just because he refused to let you do it.'  So, the bouncer leaves him with us and wanders back to his post and the Sergeant starts talking to the man, explaining he's not going to be searched and that he should go to another club.\n\nAt this point the guy sniffs loudly, rubs his nose and thanks us, before turning to me and asking 'you know why I didn't want him to search me?'  I can barely make a noise of polite curiosity before he's whipped out his wallet and presented it to me like a proud child with their artwork.  'Well, 's in there like,' he said, proffering it to me and sniffing again.  He's a bit dazed, and his voice and the slight unsteadiness to his stance make me think I could probably justify a misuse of drugs search... But really he's offering it to me while I'm surrounded by two other PCs and a Sgt so I'm not in danger of him claiming he never gave consent and getting me written up for an unlawful search.\n\nI take the wallet from him and ask what's in there, only to have him point to the change pouch and again say ''S in there officer.'  Of course I open it and, lo and behold what's in there?  A small snapbag of white powder.  Feeling the paperwork crying out in joy back at the station, I ask him what it is.  In a refreshing display of honesty he at least responds with 'Well, 's coke yeah.'\n\nGood job mate, you're arrested under suspicion of possession of class A controlled substances, and having been in the city centre for 90 seconds I bundle him into the back of the carrier and the sergeant drives myself and my partner back to the station.\n\nWhy me and my partner?  Well, because I'm a Special Constable I did a total of 500hrs in a year and after 8 months since attestation this is my second arrest as opposed to 'being in company while someone arrests.'  And going back to the matter of training...  The Constabulary hasn't trained me in the custody and case management system, so I can input the crime details, make a property record, make my statement etc., but I can't input the case details or make the handover package  for the morning shift.\n\nGood job random man: you could've gone on to another (actually better) club, but instead you spent a night in the cells, got a caution, and made two officers leave work two hours late on an almost dead quiet night as the only incident on the nightsafe. :-/",

        "text": "When I overhear dispatch utter the words of \"family member found the victim\" over the radio, I already know that an emotional rollercoaster is about to begin. Once those words echo throughout our division, my partner and I glance over at each other and start the process of gathering our note-taking materials.  The on-duty Sergeant hears the same and notifies the Evidence Technician to start heading to the address.\n\nI can safely say that I've never heard dispatch finish that sentence on a positive note in my entire career. It's never \"family member found the victim....and they're doing just fine.\" The sentence always ends violently and I immediately imagine how I will find the victim as I'm driving to the address.\n\nAs we arrive at the address, the emotional rollercoaster begins as family members frantically rush to us and demand we give them immediate answers. \"Why did they do this, what caused this, why didn't they say anything, how could they do this to us...?!\"\n\n**Suicides.** \n\nThe type of investigation where I end my shift feeling like I ran a marathon.\n\nI've seen them all: pistols to the head, nooses around the neck, overdoses by prescription pills, razors to the wrists, rifles in the mouth, and other variations that all have the same end result.\n\nThere's one common theme to every single suicide investigation and it's always the question, \"Why?\" Family members will read and reread the suicide notes left behind by their deceased loved one and still look at me like I have an answer for them. It's impossible to justify one individual's final act that I've never met in my life before, but we sit there and pretend we have an answer. Just when you think that someone is starting to calm down and beginning to accept what had transpired, they'll immediately burst into tears at a memory of them from the day prior. Each one of my questions about their family member elicits a similar reaction. \"When did they go to bed?\" They begin crying. \"What did they last say to you?\" More tears. \"Did you ever think they'd have the ability to do this?\" The whole family breaks down. \n\nMy investigative report needs to be done, so we keep pressing them for more answers until the coroner arrives to begin their investigation. The coroner motions to us to take him to the location of the body and we finally close the door on the family members. We'll all stand there and start asking ourselves the same questions about the body in the room. \"Depression? Nothing suspicious? Everything point to suicide? Any notes?\" We inspect the body and make sure that everything points to a self-inflicted demise. The last thing we want is family members contacting us months later claiming that there's no way they could have ever done it and it must've been a homicide.\n\nMy partner and I choose to remain in the room as the coroner goes back outside to the family to detail the next steps of the investigation. We're done with the emotions outside, so we stay with the body and I ask myself what leads someone to convince themselves that there were no other options. I find that I have the same questions as the family members, even though I have no emotional connection to this victim.\n\nThe last, and biggest drop in the rollercoaster ride, comes when the ambulance service arrives to transport the body to the county morgue. The image of their family member zipped up in a clean white bag is too much for most of them. The loudest wailing comes when they are lifted and moved outside to the awaiting ambulance. I follow directly behind them to get out of the residence, I've had enough.\n\nWe finally find peace and quiet inside of our squad when the ambulance pulls away. We drive back to our division and await the next ride.\n\n",

        "text": "A day ago, 4/26, I was doing a ride along (something I want to do more or and possibly enter our local Explorers program) with our Sheriffs office. I was with a younger deputy who has been with us for 7 years. At around 0700 we got a call, saying there were reports of a possible drunk driver and that this guy had almost hit a pedestrian. We got the plate and a description of the veh. We drove up the main road one way and the deputy was trying to type information while I looked for the veh. We saw the veh turn into the opposite lane, so we flipped around and followed a little while back to just observe the supposed intoxicated driving. After 5 minutes of that we decided to pull him over. So we pull him over, deputy goes up asks for license etc. as the deputy is walking back to the car, the civilian (i forgot the abbreviation thing) got out and started running down the side of this hill. I opened my door and said \"runner\" and the deputy just turned around, hauling ass, and attempted to stop the guy with a taser, he got up and ran again. They kept running down the hill when finally the deputy caught up and body slammed the guy as he saw he was reaching for a knife in pocket. Arrested and sent to jail for a few things. That was probably the coolest and most interesting thing I saw. It made me wanna become an officer some day. Anyways, thanks officers!\n\nStay safe,\n\nPSB",

        "text": "First of all, I just have to say that I'm so happy to have found this subreddit. I apologize in advance for any formatting issues, as I'm not a frequent reddit poster, and I will go back and edit if necessary. Anyway, I've been trying to find an appropriate place to post this story for a while now. Hopefully this subreddit is it. It's definitely not something I'd sit down and tell my family or non-law enforcement friends over lunch, because it’s honestly pretty disturbing and gross, but my coworkers and I find it absolutely hilarious, and it's too good not to share.\n\n\n\nI'm a 20-something female corrections officer at a male prison. Before I get into the story, I need to bring up an unfortunate, but very common issue that female CO's working in male prisons run into- offenders masturbating to them. I'm not talking accidentally walking up on some offender jacking off in his cell while you're doing your rounds. I'm talking offenders who sit in plain sight, deliberately staring at you while doing this, or even those who pound on their windows to get you to look at them. Yes, it's gross, creepy, pisses you off, etc. But considering how much this happens, you just have to laugh at it sometimes, and it gets to be pretty routine. You catch them, write them up, they usually say, \"She's lying! I'd never do that!\", they get in trouble, and life goes on.\n\n\n\nNow, this story takes places when I was working in a housing unit one night. I was on paper, meaning it was my job to man the bubble (control module) and keep the chrono on the computer for the entire shift. The paper officer is not allowed to leave the bubble unless they're relieved by another CO, so keep in mind that I was pretty limited on what I could immediately do in this situation. The bubble is pretty much all glass, and looks directly into C and D wings, giving you a view of the day room and a good majority of the cells. This is necessary, because we're the kind of camp that lets the GP offenders walk around in their assigned wings freely for the most part, so we need to be able to see what's going on in the wings at all times. Unfortunately, the glass obviously works both ways, and the offenders have a great view of the CO sitting in the bubble from most places in the wing as well. \n\n\n\nSo, I was sitting in the bubble typing up my chrono. I looked up and scanned the wings. Nothing going on in C-wing, perfect. Then I looked into D-wing, and noticed an offender, we'll call him Mr. Jackson, hurriedly walking back to his cell, which was directly across from the bubble at the end of the wing. I didn't think much of this. That is, until he pulled up a chair right in front of his doorway, sat down, got his dick out, and started going to town while staring directly at me. \n\n\n\nI was disgusted and annoyed, but not surprised, because every female officer at the camp was well aware of the fact that Mr. Jackson already had 50+ sexual misconduct violations for doing similar things (hence why he is the mad jacker!). Keep in mind, this guy is sitting in the doorway of his cell, which leads into the day room. There are still other offenders walking around in the day room right in front of him, so any one of them could have easily seen him doing this if they'd happened to turn around. Pretty risky move for Mr. Jackson, considering that a lot of offenders don't take kindly to other offenders who jack off to female staff, especially not out in the open like this. In short, it's a great way to get your ass kicked, and really underscores the fact that Mr. Jackson simply *did not* give a shit.\n\n\n\nSince I couldn't leave the bubble, I stood up and walked over to the glass, clearly mouthing the word 'STOP' to him. He immediately stopped, stood up, and walked  to the bubble. 'Great, here we go,' I think, because Mr. Jackson also has a reputation for being a loud mouth and behaving like a lunatic. But, instead of doing something crazy, he calmly opened the chuck hole (an access port from the wing to the bubble, mostly used to talk to the offenders without you leaving the bubble or them leaving the wing), and asked, \"Hey, Miss K, did you call movement yet?\" It really felt like he was just trying to ascertain whether or not I had seen what he was doing, as though me standing up and telling him to stop was some kind of coincidence. I just glared at him and shook my head, and he walked away.\n\n\n\nI got on the radio and asked for the housing unit sergeant to call me. I told him what happened, and he called the shift commander to see if we could lock him down (take him to administrative segregation or the hole). The shift commander said no to locking him down because the hole was getting pretty full, and for me to just write him a violation and have it read in the housing unit office. Annoying, because I wanted him out of my house, but whatever. \n\n\n\nI was working on writing the violation, still on the computer in the bubble, when I looked up to scan the wings again. C-wing still looked good. D-wing, not so much, because *again* Mr. Jackson is just sitting in his chair in the doorway jacking it to me. Thankfully, right after I noticed this, his cellie started walking over to the cell, so he had to stop.  Pretty angry at this point, I again called the sergeant, and told him that this guy *had* to be locked down. Another call to the shift commander, and we had the green light to take him to the hole. But, we had to read the violation to Mr. Jackson in the housing unit office first. \n\n\nLong story short, Mr. Jackson was surprisingly quiet during the reading. Then the sergeant asked him if he had a statement. He looked at me and smiled before looking at the sergeant and saying something along the lines of, \"Yes. This female right here, she participates in this. She encourages us and condones this behavior. Cell 31 participates in this as well. She enjoys it.\" Now, it's common for these guys to plead not guilty, call us liars, talk about how much respect they have for women, etc., but I'd never heard anything like this excuse before. It was incredibly hard for the sergeant, the other CO in the room, and me to keep from laughing at how ridiculous this was. Nevertheless, we managed to keep it serious, and he got escorted to the hole by the other CO and sergeant. \n\n\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, the other CO and sergeant walked into the housing unit, laughing their asses off, and told me to let them into D-wing. I obliged, and they went straight to Mr. Jackson's now former cell. They came out about 5 minutes later with something in a paper bag, laughing even harder than before, and went to the office with it. A little while later, they called me into the office, and told me that the escort went something like this:\n\n\nMr. Jackson- \"Hey, sarge, what if I told you I had some proof that she solicits me to do this?\"\n\nSergeant- \"What kind of proof?\"\n\nMr. Jackson- \"Well... That wasn't even my dick that I was shaking at her...\"\n\nSergeant- \"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\n\nMr. Jackson- \"Well, it was actually a dildo. She asked me to make a replica of my dick and wave it at her from my cell. She's into that.\"\n\n\nSergeant- *trying not to laugh* \"Oh, okay, man. I'll take a look in your cell and see if I can find your proof for you.\"\n\n\nMr. Jackson- \"Thanks, sarge! I knew someone would believe me.\"\n\n\n\n\nAs you can probably guess, they *did* find Mr. Jackson’s homemade dildo in that cell. He made it out of paper, and even colored it to match his skin tone, drew hairs on it, etc. It was pretty detailed. Unfortunately for Mr. Jackson, his ‟proof” didn’t actually prove anything, and definitely didn’t get him off the hook. He ended up staying in the hole for about 4 months, considering how many violations he already had for this. And, spoiler alert, they released him back to my housing unit after his time in the hole, and he made it a total of 45 minutes in the house with me before getting locked down for jacking off to me during count. What a guy. \n\n\n\nLike I said, my fellow CO’s and I still laugh at this ridiculous story all the time. It’s disgusting, of course, but these creeps will never stop, and I can (in a weird way) appreciate the ones that at least give me a funny story to tell. Thankfully, they transferred Mr. Jackson to another camp a few weeks ago. I can only hope that it will be a long time before I have to see another prison-made dildo created specially for me!",

I was heading back from range practice, when I spotted a sportbike with a passenger doing about 85mph in a 65 mph zone, cutting through traffic, with no license plates. I remembered one of my training Troopers had told me, \"If you want to get into pursuits, try to stop motorcycles.\"\n\nMy intent was to give the driver a warning. I turned my lights on, and the rider took the nearest exit. We stopped next to a sidewalk, and the rider turned the bike off. I gave the rider instructions over the microphone, \"Take the keys out of the ignition.\"\n\nI watched as the passenger got off the bike...and ran across the street. Well, this seemed a bit unusual. I gave the instructions again, \"Take the keys out of the ignition.\" I heard the bike start back up. \"Don't do it, don't do it!\"\n\nHe did it.\n\n\"Unit 2, in pursuit.\"\n\n\"Unit 2, in pursuit, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Unit 2, westbound on Mission Street from River Street. Black motorcycle, no plates. Original want was speed. Currently traveling at 30mph.\" And increasing.\n\nDispatch echoed it all back while we approached a green light. The bike tried to pass a car on the right, but I had my lights and sirens on, which meant the car was yielding to the right. The rider had to slam on his brakes, and he narrowly swerved around to the left, which gave me time to catch up.\n\n\"Unit 2, passing 5th Street, 45mph, moderate traffic.\" I was chasing a sportbike that now had an open road ahead. Blew through one red light...and another...and another. \"Unit 2, he just blew multiple red lights.\" We were just about at 60mph when the rider had to slow for a turn, heading back to the freeway.\n\n\"Unit 2, left turn on 8th street, heading back to the freeway. Speeds at 40mph, moderate traffic.\"\n\nThe rider got on the freeway. \"Unit 2, we're back on the freeway, heading westbound. Speeds at 70mph, light traffic.\" I watched as the power to weight ratio of the motorcycle started leaving me behind.\n\n\"100mph....120mph. Unit 2, I'm going to cancel, lost visual. Last seen westbound from 20th street at approximately 140mph.\"\n\nThe entire event lasted about 60 seconds. No air available, and no units in the right direction ahead of me. He got away, but in doing so, turned what would have been a warning into felony evading while nearly getting himself killed. It doesn't seem worth it.",

        "text": "Forgive any spelling and grammar errors I'm typing this on my phone. Anyways I'm back with a quick one from when my dad was on the motorcycle patrol.  This happened about 23-24 years ago(oh my goodness I'm 19 and that makes me feel old).  You may have experienced first hand how speed traps work, two officers, either two cruisers or two motorcycles usually, set up in a spot to radar incoming traffic.  \n\nThat's what my father was doing when this beautiful firebird comes flying down a road at almost 30 over...And doesn't stop even when my dad's partner started walking into the road.  A Chase ensues, and the firebird lost control when taking a sharp turn that it couldn't make at that speed. It hits the curb and smacks the axle onto the curb and it wasn't going anywhere anytime soon.  Impounded and the runner was arrested.\n\nWell even more back story: during this time my father would drive a car, then sell it and usually buy another one from the impound lot for cheap (like a running car that needs a little bit if work for as little as 200)\n\nSo he went into his usual impound lot (I'm serious he would go through a car every month or two). Says hello and asks what's new and what do you know there's that firebird sitting there.  So my dad waits a month and it's still there, he knew what was wrong with it since he was the one who impounded it. So he goes up and asks if they would take 250 for it. Deal, he took it home fixed the axle and drove the car for two years before selling it.\n\nCan't do this anymore due to the cost of tags and insurance. But it's a good idea if you have kids (I dont), to go to an impound lot and see what they will take for some of the cars. My brothers first car was a 1999 Grand Cherokee sport. Impound lot auction for 400$. Impounded from weed and meth dealers who didn't show for court since their info was still in the car.\n\nHe's got more to tell but it's finals week so it may take me a while to get them up.

        "text": "I hope this is OK here, it involved me just over 20 years \nago, The Titty Man, bondsmen, and Sheriff's \nDeputies. Forgive formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\n\nI got my first job at an answering service when I was 16,\nand I loved it. We answered for about 200 businesses, and there was quite a mix.  Same old, same old every day, but different, too. I was the baby of the office, and so was usually not alone, and my coworkers protected me from the usual office debauchery, (read drugs, sex, booze) but somehow forgot to mention The Titty Man to me, so this came as a bit of a shock that he did what he did.\n\nI'd been working there a few weeks, and was alone on a Sunday night, answering calls here and there, and being bored. The line for a visiting nurse company (home health care, hospice, and rehab) lights up. I answer, to be greeted with a collect call from the local county jail.\n\nI accept the call, thinking that someone might have an elderly parent they can't reach, and need a well check, or to schedule extra visits because they got locked up. Nope. I'm greeted with \"How big's your tits?\" I promptly hung up. He called back several times, and I HAVE to accept the call in case it really IS for the reasons listed above.\n\nI contact the on-call nurse, she tells me what I just told you about, and how he does this from time to time; I then proceed to be harassed for about half an hour, when I get a brilliant idea. Of course, Titty Man calls back, and I accept the call.\n\nI tell him I have to put him on hold sometimes so I can answer the phone, but I'll talk to him. He likes this. He starts asking questions, dirty ones, and I answer a few, then put him on hold, grab the other headset and don it. Here is where law enforcement comes in to play.\n\nI called the bondsmen we also answered for, and explained my situation. He grabbed HIS other phone, and called his buddy inside the jail, relaying the situation. He's having trouble doing this, because he's also listening to me talk dirty to this creep. I was VERY creative for Titty Man, and he ate it up. My bondsman was laughing so hard he was in tears!\n\nSince Titty Man was calling from inside the overcrowded jail, they couldn't pinpoint him just by being on a phone. Deputies began shutting down banks of phones, one at a time. When the call cut off mid-pervy-spew, the officers checked who was on that bank.\n\nLo and behold, there was Titty Man. He was in jail because he was (SURPRISE!!) making obscene and harassing phone calls! Who'd a thunk it? Deputies took him into custody with new charges, and he got another 18 months or so tacked on to his existing sentence. The idiot was fairly short to the door, too.\n\nMy story doesn't end here, however. Several years later I was working at another answering service, and he calls. Same company and everything. (My old service had closed.) I informed the on-call nurse (same one as before, too), and they ended up pressing charges on him AGAIN!\n\nIt's been 20 years since I first encountered The Titty Man, and no longer do answering service work, but I have a few friends that still do, and the creep is still at it.\n\nI hope you got a kick out of my story.",

        "text": "Sorry if this might be a bit lengthy. I first heard about this story at my father's retirement ceremony.  So I asked my father the full details of what he could remember about the cow and he told me all that he could remember.  This was his 2nd year on the force so this was before I was even born(he's already retired after 25 years of service) so he was a little fuzzy on some of the details. \n\nOkay so some general background is that for about 15 years my father was on the motorcycle patrol. (Because we aren't allowed to  I say what city we live in?right?) The city we live in is mostly suburban, not very agricultural but no highrise buildings... Ok just imagine central Florida towns, not the beach city's but the central Florida where it's not very touristy and where most people live. \n\nSo cows aren't very common downtown but apparently once in a blue moon, a cow will jump over the railroad tracks and wander downtown.  So officer clumsy as we will call him, was sent by dispatch to figure out if there was actually a cow downtown and not just some kid playing a prank.\n\nSo he drove down there in his police cruiser and sure enough there's this regular ol cow just standing in the middle of the railroad crossing.  It didn't react to the siren so officer clumsy (who had grown up on a farm so generally knew how cows behave) turned off his car for some reason, got out and slowly approached to make sure it wasn't injured.  \n\nThe cow didn't appreciate being approached by a stranger and started to chase officer clumsy towards his car. (Now remember he had turned off his cruiser and coincidentally never put the keys in his pocket, you can guess where this is going). Since this was a fully grown   cow that weighed as much as a small car, Officer Clumsy wasn't staying around to play matador. \n\nHe turned around and yelled into his radio that he needed backup immediately. And as he was running from the soon to be Big Mac, he dropped his keys in the road and jumped into his car without realizing.\n\nMy father was patrolling the area when he heard the panicking screams of someone being chased, so he hopped onto his motorcycle and head over since he was very close to him.  \n\nAfter about a minute of driving he rolls up on the scene. The cow is head butting Officer Clumsy's patrol car. My dad then reports to dispatch that Officer Clumsy is being held hostage by the cow it seems.  My dad beeps his siren at the cow without thinking. Bad move, the cow turned around and started to go towards my dad. The road was too small and my dad didn't have the time to turn around so he bailed.  And he ran to the only safe spot, Officer Clumsy's cruiser, who was yelling about the keys but my dad wasn't having it and ran to the passenger side of the cruiser.\n\nWell there was a problem, the door was locked. And my dad had a very pissed off cow trotting towards him. So he starts running around the police car with the cow right behind him yelling at Officer Clumsy to unlock the door.  On his second lap he opens the door to see the printer, files, a sandwich, and other things, in the seat.  My dad isn't too large, about 5'9, but with police gear you tend to look alot bigger. So he looked at that seat and knew he wasn't going to fit. He closes the door and keeps running while screaming for Officer Clumsy to clean off the seat.\n\nThe funniest thing that happened on the air of the radio was Officer Clumsy reporting to dispatch after an update was requested.  \"Uhhhh dispatch, he's currently being chased by the cow, I dont think he can come to the phone right now but I'll take a message\" \n\nAbout this point my father is pretty tired after running almost 9 times around the car and finally he's able to dive screaming into the car and be just in time for the cow to slam the door closed.  He then tells Officer Clumsy to put it in gear and drive away from the mad cow. After being informed that the keys are outside he proceeds to call dispatch about what is being done. About this time one of those old massive diesel farm trucks pull up towing a trailer meant for cows. The driver gets out and my dad and the other officer are screaming to get back in the car when the cow just calmly stops headbutting the doors and WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE TRAILER.  and patiently waits for this old guy in his 60's to walk over and open the trailer for it.  It climbs in and sticks its head out the window staring at two completely bewildered cops.  \n\nThe owner was given a couple of fines but mostly let off with a slap on the wrist for letting a dangerous animal escape.  According to the people watching from the windows nearby, they couldn't stop laughing and wished they had recorded it.\n\nThanks for reading the story, I know a few other things that are really short so I might make a small compilation story to share a few.\n\nTLDR officer investigates reports of a cow downtown, finds it, turns off car gets out drops keys when chased. Dad rolls up on motorcycle gets off it, chased around, hilarity ensues.",

        "text": "As my first (and last) position as a corrections nurse I learned many things. Some of which I had to learn two or three times. You must realize that as a nurse I usually have the milk of human kindness flowing from my breast. This is not what makes a good prison nurse. You have to remember that anytime a prisoner opens his mouth he is 1. Lying and/or 2. Running a con and any complaint even chest pain must be evaluated with security as the first consideration. You must also be aware that prisoners packed like sardines tend to resort to some strange practices to satisfy the sexual tension that men have. More sex happens in prison than on the outside and it is \"against the rules\" it is even listed in the inmate handbook.\n\nWell here is my funniest story from the penitentiary. We had an observation cell in medical that is usually used to keep an eye on inmates that have threatened suicide. It is a glass cell that has no privacy for the inmate. They are given a paper gown and that is all the luxuries they get, no glasses, no nothing. As I was leaving one evening prior to 2 glorious days off the inmate in the observation cell motioned to me to come over. Like most new employees of an institution like this I went over to the cell. Suicidal inmate tells me that the concrete in the cell is drying out his feet and causing them to crack and bleed. He was brilliant he said nothing else or requested nothing. My nurse mind kicked in and I got him a small medicine cup of hand lotion and went on my way for my days off away from that cursed place.\n\nWhen I returned to work nothing was any different. I began my shift and about midway through I entered the pharmacy and heard one of the female staff comment \"I wish I knew who gave him that lotion\". I of course proud that I had not become jaded or distrustful and remained a caring individual piped up and stated proudly \"I did\". I thought that I would gain respect for my caring about the needs of my fellow human beings. Well the nurses stopped talking and all looked at me in a very disgusted way. I was like, what what did I do wrong................................................................................................................................................\n\nOf course he had been watching the female staff for two days masturbating with that lotion.",

I was standing outside the chow hall at dinner, shaking inmates down to prevent food being taken back to the dorms (chow hall food can only be eaten in the chow hall). I motioned to a young white inmate, complete with sig rune tattoos on his throat and swastikas on his arms, and said \"C'mere, I need to shake you down.\" \n\nHe looked at me like I was from Mars and replied, \"Vergib mir, mein herr, ich spreche nicht Englisch.\" (\"Forgive me, sir, I don't speak English.\") He kept walking. \n\nWithout missing a beat, I called, \"Kommen sie hier, schnell!\" (\"Come here, fast!\") He stopped, turned, and the color ran away from his face as I pointed to the asphalt in front of me, glowering like a drill sergeant. Head hung low, he came back and I patted him down, finding nothing by way of contraband.  I stepped back. Usually inmates took that as their cue to beat feet. He didn't. I growled, \"Sträfling. Geh weg.\" (\"Inmate. Go away.\") He didn't seem to get it, like he *SPOILER ALERT* didn't actually speak German. I just pointed up the sidewalk, still scowling.  He shuffled off, tail between his legs, and caught up with his Neo Nazi buddies about 30 feet up the sidewalk, all of whom were howling with laughter at him getting called out by a rookie. They kept looking back at me, trying to figure out if I was actually German or just looked it. I couldn't resist. I had to get my parting shot in. \"SCHAU NICHT MEHR ZURÜCK, ARSCHLÖCKER!\" I bellowed. (\"Don't look back, assholes!\") They seemed to understand that. They at least figured it out from context.\n\nOne would think that I was fluent. Truth be told, I'm not, not even slightly. I remember a bit of the German I studied in 5th grade, plus listening to Rammstein and Eisbrecher and watching old WWII movies. I never had another problem out of that inmate, or out of the Aryan Brotherhood set he ran with. Brothers and sisters, when in doubt, bluff your ass off. Sometimes it works.",

I remembered that I had a package expected to arrive that day.\n   \nLittle bit of background: our house was decent sized and had a large driveway that was about 70-90 ft long that goes along the side of the garage.  So naturally, you can fit alot of vehicles in the driveway.\n\nSo I step out the front door and to my shock, there's three police SUV's, a cruiser with a k-9, and about 5 cruisers.  Seeing as how I didn't remember becoming wanted by all of my city's police force. I was decently confused but assumed my father had something to do with it.\n\nMy father was in the police force at the time (retired after 25 years on the force 2 years ago) and due to his location he was able to take his cruiser home and have it at the house.\n\nSo apparently this convoy of heavily armed police officers were on there way to a location near their target to do their final preparations for their operation.  My father was driving home from work and the convoy apparently mistook him for the lead car and followed him to our house expecting my father to be part of their team.\n\nAfter a bit of confusion they inform my dad about the situation and they all have their laughs and such.... Then they went out to bust a house because an old lady tried to hire a Hitman to pull off an assassination on her recently divorced husband for not supporting her addiction (I need to ask my father all I remember was it was some opioid).  She ended up being taken into jail for who knows how long.\n\nMy dad has alot of interesting stories including one where he was chased by a cow downtown after trying to rescue another officer who dropped his keys and was being held hostage by the cow.

        "text": "This one is a long one... xposted from a reply to AskReddit bit I've been meaning to post it here. \n\nI work as a Transit Officer for my city's train and bus system. I was fresh out of the academy, on my third day of FTO. On my last trip of the night, we get up to Smithville Station (name changed, obviously) which is the end terminal, so I have to walk through the train to make sure everyone is off before we pull the train up to turn it around. As I am doing this, I have a young lady try and board the train, and I inform her that we need to have the train empty for our turn around procedures.\n\nUpon contacting her, she stepped off the train, cried out as if in distress, and threw the bag she was carrying on the ground. Before I could step off to find out what the issue was, the engineer shut the doors. I mentioned to my FTO that she was out there and seemed to be distressed so that we could make contact after turning the train around.\n\nOnce we pull back up to the platform, the lady is nowhere to be found. I begin to check the station area, looking for her, thinking she may be hurt. As I am looking, I see her come walking back up toward the train. \n\nAs I approach her, she calls out to me, \"Are we in trouble?\" (Note: She was by herself, yet used the pronoun \"we\". This is what's known as foreshadowing.)\n\n\"No ma'am.\" I reply. \"You just seemed a little upset, and I wanted to come check on you. Are you trying to catch this train?\"\n\n*shrug*\n\n\"Well,\" I tell her, \"this train is going to City Center Station. Where are you trying to get to?\"\n\n\"City Center Station, I guess.\"\n\n\"Well, we're leaving in one minute. Go hop on if you need this train.\"\n\nShe proceeds to board the back of the train, while I go hop on the front. I give my FTO a rundown on our conversation, noting that due to the dilation of her eyes and her mannerisms, that she may be on drugs.  We go to talk to the only other passenger on board, to see if she was acting weird on the platform, and he tells us she was pacing back and forth, talking to herself and generally acting weird.\n\nMy FTO has me go contact her to ask for her ride ticket. She pulls one out that expired 3 days prior, and when I point this out, she replies \"I just used this this morning, how long were we asleep?\" Because she doesn't have a valid ticket, I ask if he has an ID, and she begins to get very belligerent and agressive. I call in to dispatch,\n\n\"Twenty-Three, show me out with one on Train 56, southbound out of Smithville. Subject aggressive and belligerent. Unable to identify. Can I get cover to meet at City Center Station?\"\n\nMy FTO moves to try and calm her, because he can tell I'm getting overwhelmed and unable to fully handle the situation, and we shortly arrive to City Center. \n\nUpon arrival to the platform at City Center, we walk her off the train, and get her sat down on her bag while we try and get her identified.\n\n\"So I want to be able to call you by your name. What's your name?\"\n\n\"I don't have a name, I just evolved yesterday. Before yesterday, I didn't even know what pizza was. Can I smoke a cigarrette?\"\n\nI tell her she can, and she dumps a pack of butts out into her hand, picking through then for the longest one, and says in a singing voice \"if I'm getting in trouble, youre getting in trouble too!\"\n\nAfter a few minutes of chatting and finally getting her identified. I finally get a name out of her and call in to dispatch. \n\n\"Twenty-Three, can I get a name check on this subject?\n\nDispatch comes back, \"Your subject has multiple priors for disorderly conduct, mischief, public urination. Currently on suspension from 10/6/2016 to 10/6/17.\"\n\n As I'm talking to my FTO to get the next course of action, she jumps up off her bag and starts looking around frantically, eyes popping out of her head. \n\nI go to her, \"You're ok ma'am. Everything is gonna be all right. Just have a seat back on your bag.\"\n\n\"I can't sit on it anymore. It's getting mad at me.\"\n\nWe ended up booking her on a 72 hour psych hold, and wrote her a citation for trespassing, due to her suspension. Don't know what happened to her after that, but when I went in to write my reports later that night, I was telling another officer about it, and he says \"You met Jane Doe on your third night in FTO? I've had a few run ins with her. Crazier than a shit house rat.\"",

        "text": "This is the scene in which my first interaction with American police goes (from 2 years ago, so not recent).\n\nOne relatively young looking female kneeling on the ground hands up, 3 drunk guys almost brawling with shattered glass bottles on the ground and threats being shouted. \n\nLet me back up and give some backstory:\n\nI was about as \"fresh off the boat\" as could be, brand new to the US and its ways. I got into a political argument strong enough to find myself out on the streets, stranded in a part of town with more strip clubs and bars than anything else, in the middle of an area with heavy drugs and crime. \nSo there I am, late into the night sitting on a bench, attired in the only clothing I have, more traditional Muslim clothing for women. It is 0300, and I have no idea of what to do. I know little in the country I am in, and am just trying to wait out the night to find a way to get in contact with the few people I know. Eventually I find a bench, and wait the night. \nAs I am still in heavy crime areas, not that I really knew too much the difference then or where to go, eventually some drunk men come over. In the midst of language barrier and cultural differences in understanding, somehow some message gets communicated that I don't know exactly. According to their minds, we make an agreement for something and eventually they start to fight with each other/ also me by location. So far it is only shouting and pushes, just men trying to outdo one another.\n\nIn a split second, one throws their beer bottle to the ground and the fight escalates. I am near solid on the bench, having moved as far away as I can without giving them ability to bring me off bench and maybe onto darker streets. I don't understand what is being said, or where exactly the argument is going. One of them has focused more towards me, and I am just trying to make as small a target of myself I can.\n\nUpon this come 3 police officers. I don't know who called, but I had no real knowing of what they were like in America. Orders were called, I didn't understand but wanted away from the men and to show no threat to those with guns. I dropped to the earth, onto shattered glass and was quite happy to stay there. Meanwhile, they are dealing with the men who are incredibly drunk and firmly believe that they have the right to stay/ not cooperate. \n\nEventually, they get the men decent under control and then comes the challenge of communication between them and us. I am quite happy staying on the ground, and don't really want to give excuse for violence against me. They would like me off earth and away from the beer bottles. I don't initially understand and think they want me facedown on unsafe ground, but that is not what they want so communication under the stress of then is challenging. \nAfter a few more minutes, after EMS arrives because of the fight with broken glass, things calm some and we talk. I think they talk about maybe getting a translator, but apparently that would be hours so we use limited words and hand gestures to get messages across. \n\nI am sure dealing with an immigrant girl who was more scared of them than physical violence from a group of drunk men was not easy. However, they treated me kindly, offered me kinder words than most. In a time when the area hated Muslims, they treated me with courtesy great enough to allow me to cover myself before speaking. \n\nWhen faced with barriers of language and physical access, the cops involved listened to what I had to say and helped me find a safer area for the rest of the night. They did not humiliate me, or make me feel more unsafe as a newly arrived young Muslim girl despite it being 3 males. \n\nPerhaps this is a long story, but my first interaction with American police has shaped my opinions for time to come and given me something to remember when treatment differs. English is not my first language, so I apologize for errors.\n\nEdit for english grammar errors + to improve timeline.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Last Tuesday I was on my way to hospital for some tests etc. On the way there, there had happened an accident about an hour before and when I got there they were doing emergency road repairs as a result of that accident. This was on a 2 lane highway where the speed limit is normally 100 km/h. \n\nA rather large Hummer was weaving from the left lane to the right one and vice versa all the time - often he didn't even look if there was space for him. I guess he wanted to get to the front of the traffic jam fast to save himself about a minute of his time. A lot of drivers had to brake hard to let him in to avoid an accident, even though they were going at most 20 km/h.\n\nI had been seeing this Hummer come closer in my rear view mirror for a while. I was determined to not let him in. I was on the right lane. I kept real close to the car in front of me. But the guy in the Hummer still put on his blinker and went to his right... where I was. Eventually, I had no choice but to make an evasive manoeuvre into the emergency lane, while heavily laying on my horn. Hummer guy put up his middle finger in my general direction. \n\nWhat Hummer guy hadn't noticed is that we had gotten close to the accident site now and that there were still 2 police cars there. One officer gestured to me to stop and then pointed at Hummer guy to pull over as well. He came to me and essentially asked me \"I saw this, this and this. Did I see that right?\" I told him yes. The officer went to the Hummer guy and asked for license and registration etc., and proceeded to write him a fine for the Dutch equivalent of dangerous driving. The officer's partner told me a few minutes later that the Hummer guy had so many unpaid tickets that Hummer guy would just be guy in a little bit; his Hummer was getting towed. He also told me thanks for my help and that I could move on. So I did. \n\nI was on time for my hospital appointment despite all this.",

I wasn't particularly interested in getting a ticket so was going the speed limit on a highway which is known for the cops being everywhere. I was on this highway for only 3 miles out of the 22 i was going to be on it for and i got cut off by a silver with a lease company I recognized so that made me remember the license plate number as well. \n\nFast forward a half hour later and i'm on a bridge and sure enough, this same car cuts me off again. I'm not sure how i got in front of him but he cut me twice in a half hour. \n\nSo I get off the highway right by my house and sure enough I see this silver car with same leasing company pulled over by a local cop. So not only did I end up getting home before him, I didn't have the bother of having to take care of a ticket and points on my record. That's why I don't try and save three minutes off my read, because it can cost a helluva lot more if you get pulled over. ",

        "text": "I could have sworn I've posted here before, but I guess not going by an author search so hi! I've had a lot of run-ins with police due to my, as I call it, 'skilled but not legal' driving. Usually it ends in a warning or maybe a ticket, and only once have I been caught doing anything other than speeding (which has happened quite a few times, mostly in the 25+mph over range). But this time was different.\n\nA couple years ago, I was attending CalTech for my degree in Electronic Engineering/Robotics. I lived in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA at the time, so I spent a fair number of hours on the major freeways between there and Pasadena. I somewhat quickly found that parts of those roads are nearly empty during off-peak hours, and as such I sometimes maybe used those roads for max speed runs. Totally because I was late for school. Totally. \n\nI should also introduce you to my cars, or at least the car I was in this particular day. I won't say exactly what it is, but only 30 were ever made, it has around 1000hp thanks to a couple mods, and while it doesn't exactly stand out or get easily identified like other such exotics, it certainly has the looks, sound, and performance of something that's probably slightly expensive-ish or at least important-ish, and more to the point shouldn't be crashed into. It also has an 11-99 plate frame, which I claim is what's gotten me out of a lot of tickets but probably isn't the case. These are important. Should also be noted I was getting said degree not for a job, but to learn a hobby more in-depth.\n\nSo one day I was on one of those freeways during off-peak hours, driving at a reasonable 80mph (matching traffic really) in the lane next to the far left, when a bright orange blur passed me on the right. It was none other than a 90's slammed Audi that decided, as I had before, that these roads were great for going fast on. Only difference is while I follow the old Midnight Club code of never directly endanger or injure other motorists and therefore only go fast when it's reasonably safe to (hence I don't have a single count of reckless anything on my record), this Audi decided that was for sissies and was weaving through traffic. \n\nAt first, I was cool with it. Everyone speeds differently, and imo there's nothing wrong with the occasional street race. I decided to catch up to them to do just that - an idea that lived about 5 seconds until I saw a Trooper up ahead and decided to let the Audi deal with that. Not long after that, said Audi did something ridiculously stupid: a minivan on the freeway was neck-and-neck with a SUV on the onramp, and this Audi decided the best possible course of action was not to go around the minivan, but to cross the white line and go between these two cars despite the ever-closing gap. That's beyond stupid, Mr Trooper agreed, and flipped on his lights. Only issue is the Audi decided against stopping.\n\nI decided to help Mr Trooper in the only way I know how: floor it. Specifically, floor it to get ahead of the Audi, jump three lanes over to get right in front of it, and slow down, weaving as they tried to pass me. He was trapped between me in front, the cop behind, the semi in the next lane, and the guardrail. He gave in and stopped. First smart decision of the day.\n\nI knew Mr Trooper would wanna have a word with me, seeing as how that was highly illegal but also helpful. Mr Trooper actually came up to me first, signaling to the Audi driver to stay put. I was fully expecting to be in serious trouble. Instead, he sternly told me to never do that again, then thanked me and told me I could go. That was it. No ticket, no impound threats, nothing. So off I went.\n\nMoral of the story: when I actually am driving recklessly but in the name of justice, I get thanked, but when I just speed with no one around me, I have to go to court. I will never understand the legal system...",

        "text": "I was parked on the side of a freeway, eating a sandwich, sitting where people could see my car. We're directed to park in obvious places to try and get people to see us and slow down, even if we're just writing reports. Or in my case, eating sandwiches.\n\nWhile I was sitting there, I had my radar on, and saw a couple cars doing 15 or 20 miles per hour over the limit. I wasn't going after them, it was sandwich time. Until I watched a motorcycle cutting through traffic, doing double the speed limit, and an easy 20mph faster than surrounding traffic. I sighed as I put my sandwich down. I kinda had to go after that one. Given how thick traffic was and the motorcycle's speed, I didn't expect to catch up before losing sight, but I had to make an effort.\n\nI accelerated to catch up as I approached a split in the freeway, going eastbound or westbound. I couldn't see the motorcycle, but the split was elevated. And just before I had to commit, I spotted him going eastbound. I was doing 90mph and not gaining, but I wasn't giving up yet.\n\nI kept cutting through traffic, trying to catch up, briefly getting glimpses of the motorcyclist. We approached another transition, this time with three options; east, west, or exit. I figured I'd lose him here, as I saw him cut across from the fast lane to another transition. By some act of bad luck for him, I was able to follow. At this point, he still had no idea I was there as I didn't put on any forward emergency lights, only rear ones.\n\nWe took the final transition, and then exited. At the bottom of the exit was a red light. He slowed down while I pulled in right behind him...and ran his license plate. Then I turned my lights on, and chirped my siren. He turned around in his seat, looked at me, and punched it. Wrong move. We had a little pursuit through the middle of a city, and he blew through multiple red lights going way too fast. I self-terminated the pursuit for safety.\n\nIn another case of bad luck for him, I know a lot about motorcycles and everything surrounding them. So much so that I could tell what brand helmet he was wearing from the back, let alone easily identifying the make and model of the bike he was on. Through his license plate, I got the address where his bike was registered. Some social media research led me to pictures of him (probably) on that same bike wearing that same riding gear. So the next day I wrote a warrant, had a judge sign off on it, and me and a couple buddies went to his house a few cities away. All those wonderful rights you're protected by meant the warrant was only for the motorcycle and not the rider.\n\nHe answered the door. I had a newer Trooper do most of the talking just as a learning experience.\n\n\"Good afternoon, sir. Are you John Jones?\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\n\"And do you own a silver Honda motorcycle?\"\n\n\"Silver? No.\"\n\nI chimed in. \"Gray.\"\n\nMr. Jones looked at me. \"Yeah, I own a gray one...\"\n\nThe newer guy went back at it, \"Do you mind if we take a look at it?\"\n\nMr. Jones knew his rights. \"Yes, I do mind. And I don't feel comfortable answering any questions.\"\n\nI pulled the magic piece of paper from my pocket. \"That's fine, you don't have to. We have a warrant to seize it. So you can bring it out to us now, or we can go in and rip the house apart until we find it.\"\n\nMr. Jones did a hard, uh-oh type swallow. \"Do you mind if I read that?\" I handed him the warrant copy.\n\n\"You can keep it, I've got copies.\"\n\nHe finished reading it. \"Uh...it's in the garage. I'll roll it out.\"\n\nMr. Jones found himself without his motorcycle for a month. On the plus side for him, he was never charged. But instead of getting a few hundred dollar speeding ticket if he had simply stopped, he got to pay a few thousand dollars to get his bike out...if he was even able to afford getting it out at all. I never found out.",

        "text": "Hello! For college, I took a policing course and had my ride along in early February 2016. The ride along was mandated by the class but the time was never specified so I originally requested 2 hours with a suburban police force. \n\nI get in the car, we immediately go out to a 'burglary' that's fishy as anything else, and spend the better part of the two hours with an investigator, then going to a parking lot to discuss everything. The police officer and investigator were both very open to answering any questions including why they think this guy was lying about his stuff being stolen (dust, no forced entry, etc.) afterward, my time was almost up, but calls of a 10-18 were coming over the radio. It really got the officer's attention, who was getting ready to end his shift, and he asked if I wanted to go to the call- without elaborating what that call would be. \n\nI shrugged and said \"sure,\" and he took me back to the station to get with a sergeant who was going to the scene. We get to the scene and I see a police car already there, and I'm wondering what this call will be. We go inside and he says \"if it's too much, just tell me, I'll have someone come get you.\" \n\nNow I'm really curious. My limited knowledge of 10 codes means nothing here, this department uses their own unique code.  We get inside and the officer immediately asks \"where is it?\" And is directed by the other officer (an SRO who was protecting the scene) to what I assumed was some sort of crime scene. I peak over and am horrified to see a DOA, just absolutely way dead. \n\nHe ended up being a late 60s guy who was 3-4 days dead (thank GOD for the cold weather) and in really bad rigor mortis. Luckily for me, I was interested in medical stuff and this, while sad, was a really cool learning experience. We waited for the coroner to come get this guy, and the officer told me to stand back while they were moving him, in case the gasses shifted. I won't ever forget the sound the body made while they were forcing various limbs into non crumpled positions for the body bag (he died while climbing out of bed and fell over a small line for hanging clothes, so he looked more fetal-position than laying down). The smell wasn't bad, since it was so cold in the house (guy apparently didn't have heat) but it definitely had a slight smell, which everyone said was probably from food.\n\nI ended up going almost a full 8 hours with various officers from the department and had a really enlightening experience learning exactly what goes into police work and hearing the officer's personal stories.\n\nY'all are awesome, keep up the great work\n\n\nTL;DR Imagine my shock when I, a 19 year old college student just looking to complete an assignment, find out I have to guard a dead guy's body for 2 hours.",

You know where this is going, lets be honest. \nFor the last 3 years, I've owned a fairly rare 1999 Subaru Impreza WRX STi Type RA Limited, Number 387 of 1000 ever built. It's my baby. It's also heavily modified, with literally, and no exageration, no mechanical parts left on it from the factory. Not even subframes. and it's built for the track.. But road legal.\n\n\nTo the Story! \n\n\nIt had been a very very long 3 days for me. Having pulled an all nighter to just get my car finished and getting it put together, get it down to the Tuner in order for my car to be ready for the motorsports even I was attending the next day. \n\n\nI had received the phone call to say \"She's all done and ready for pick-up mate\". I bust my way 3 hours south with a friend to pick up my newly tuned car. \n\n\nPicking the car up, everything is absolutely perfect. Driving like a dream, power in the right places, just perfect. \n\n\nTime to leave town and head for the motorsports event which was on the following day. \n\n\n10 minutes later, heading out of town, we get stuck behind a big truck who simply put, didn't want to let us pass and would only do 70 in our 100 zone.\n\n\nI say to myself  &gt; \"That's alright, I'll wait for the next passing lane and overtake, no biggie\"\n\n\n**Queue spongbob *20 minutes later* line**\n\n\nI'm **Still** yet to pass this truck as every single passing lane we've come up to, this truck has blocked BOTH lanes, in some bizarre attempt to stop us passing for no obvious reason. Maybe he doesn't like blue Subaru's? \n\n\nAt this point, I'm rather perturbed that he wouldn't let us pass even in the proper passing lanes. So knowing that a passing spot is coming up, I get ready to overtake before he has a chance to move over blocking us.\n\n\nAaaaaaaaand with that, I proceed to drop a gear and give it some jandal. It hooked up WAAAAY quicker than I expected, but at that point I wasn't watching my speedo and before I knew it, boom, I was past the truck. only about 25 meters of truck, I looked further up the road, looked back at my speedo and felt the blood drain from my face.... \n\n\nI was booking at a quick glance, a solid 169.... In a 100 and there was Mr. Officer coming the opposite direction... I knew I was cooked, that was it, she was done... I threw on the anchors and pulled over, fearing what would happen.\n\n\nSurely enough, $MO threw up his lights as I was well past him already, I saw that in my rear view mirror. He came hauling up the road, and spotted me on the side already parked, window down ready and waiting.\n$MO pulled in behind me, walked up to my car took a bit of a stunned glance over everything and I will never forget the first words he spoke and the rest is verbatim \n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"Well son, lets play a game, I have my number... What's yours?\"\n\n\n*Queue stunned mullet face of $Me*\n&gt;$me &gt; *going red* \"Well, Honestly, I don't think I can tell you. I was focusing on what was going on around me and not looking at my speedo. So at a guess around 160-170, Sir.\"\n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"Good guess, 169. Please pass your lic... \"\n\n\n$Me Passes his license before $MO even finished his sentence\n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"Thank you. Alright, now before we start this... Dear lord you hauled up fast. Seriously, I think you were stopped before I was even turned around?! I was expecting a chase at those speeds to be honest\"\n\n\n&gt;$Me &gt; *Sheepishly* \"Heh, yeah shes a good car, built it to race and am heading to 'X' motorsport event. hah, no Sir.

Now, when was the last time you got in trouble, $me?\"\n\n\n&gt;$Me &gt; \"About 2-3 years ago now, sir.\" *explains when and where for what (speeding passing another car, ironic)*\n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"Right-yo, now you sit tight here and I'll be back soon\"\n\n\nI swear to god, that was the most nervous and anxious 10 minutes of my life. Feeling of impending doom.\n\n$MO is walking back to my car and I decide to try tickle his humor a little bit \n\n\n&gt;$Me &gt; \"Sooooo, do I get extra points for stopping real quick? haha\" \n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"Not gonna lie, it was impressive haha, but no, no extra points\"\n\n\n&gt;$Me *Clearly deflated* &gt; \"Yeeeah thought so, heh\"\n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"However, it's not all bad news, today I think we can work out a deal\"\n\n\nThat sentence... heeeck..\n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"Now, normally, you'd have lost your license on the spot, car impounded and crushed. Today, however is your lucky day.\"\n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"Firstly, you actually stopped, and started to do so before my lights were even on. Second, You told me the truth and haven't been in trouble for anything in 3 years. Third, you were respectful and one of the better stops I've had, in even what could've been a really shit situation for you.\"\n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"So that's why you're only going to get an Eye-watering fine, and be able to drive away from here.\"\n\n\nApologies were made, and thanks were had.\nHe left me with one final sentence \n\n\n&gt;$MO &gt; \"Have a good drive to 'X' Motorsport event. Look forward to seeing you there and going fast on the track!\" \n\nTurns out he's a motorsports fan too haha.\n\nSo that was the day I nearly lost my most prized possession and, well, you know being a nice person and telling the truth to even the person who's about to hand you a big fine or in my case what could've been a court date, can change EVERYTHING.\n \n",

It was clean and well-kept, but the thing about off-roading equipment is that it's usually restricted to off-road use only. And looking at this SUV, I saw four violations immediately. Some of those violations I had never encountered before, and I never thought anyone would actually do them and still drive on the road.\n\nI pulled the driver over. As I walked up, I saw a \"I SUPPORT POLICE\" license plate frame. That's not actually what it said, but it was what it meant.\n\nI walked up to an extremely cooperative driver, who was very polite and claimed ignorance about his vehicle's many violations. I didn't believe him, but it's no surprise that no one wants a ticket. As he handed me his driver's license, he clearly displayed a Police Officer Memorial Supporter card that was also in there, suggesting he donated a lot of money. He told me everything he was reaching for before he reached, and where everything was. He was essentially the picture-perfect driver to stop from an officer safety standpoint.\n\nHis license was valid with no prior convictions, his registration was current, his insurance was all good. Everything was great except for those four vehicle violations. If he had one violation, his cooperative nature would've earned a warning. Even with two violations, maybe a warning. But when you break that many laws at the same time, it'd be unreasonable for me not to write a ticket.\n\nSo he got a fix-it ticket with a few warnings. I was expecting a complete shift in his demeanor to being rude and angry, which happens a lot. That didn't happen. He was polite and even offered a handshake. The police supporting flair made no difference; it was all how he behaved that determined the outcome.",

About 6 of us pack into a small car to go to a party in the next town over, about 20 miles away. We had some pre-beers and were feeling pretty good before the trip, and we get going on our little adventure after dark.\n\nCouple miles into the trip buddy in the front seat hands us 2 dozen eggs, and we did not have to ask him what they were for. As cars passed from the opposite direction, one of us would lob an egg from the back window. What could go wrong with that plan?\n\nMiss!\n\nAnd another miss.\n\nAnd another, and another, until we were almost out.\n\nSo I changed up the game plan, and sat up on the passenger side back seat window sill (legs inside the car, one hand on the luggage rack), egg in hand.\n\nCar approaching, I decide the line-drive over the lob approach. Just as I let go, I hear screams from inside the car--COP!!\n\nMy unborn chicken struck the windshield directly on the drivers side. He slams on the brakes and nearly went into the ditch. I may have embellished about nearly killing the Sheriff, but as stupid as we were I was, it could've been far worse.\n\nFirst and only time I had to get out of the car and spread 'em while he lectured us about the magnitude of our fucking idiocracy. \n\nWe were never arrested and he never called our parents. He only told us that if we ever set foot in his town again he would throw us directly in county prison.\n\nWe never did return. The smartest move I ever made after the dumbest move I ever made. Fucking kids.  I personally think we were lucky to have gotten off so easy.\n\nTL;DR: pegged a cop car with 110 mph egg nearly causing him to lose control of the vehicle. We are forever banned from his town.",

        "text": "I was on patrol, on the freeway, in pretty heavy traffic, with everyone going around 20mph. A car a little bit ahead of me caught my attention because traffic sped up, and they were still stopped. As I started to pull alongside them, they sped up to catch back up to traffic. I figured they were distracted and on their phone, but I didn't see anything in their hands.\n\nAs I stayed behind them, it looked like they were having delayed reactions and driving unusually. They kept an unusually far distance behind the car in front of them, kept having a delayed response to traffic speeding up again, and were veering to the left. They'd veer left in their lane, straighten for a bit, veer left again, straighten again...almost rhythmically. I was starting to believe there was something mechanically wrong with the car. Then they veered too far left, out of their lane, and almost sideswiped the car next to them before correcting. We needed to have a chat to figure out what was going on. And like how the driver's reactions were delayed in traffic, she was also delayed in pulling over. After a good 20 seconds of lights, sirens, and commands over the microphone, the driver finally pulled over.\n\nI walked up and found both windows were rolled down. As I walked up to the driver, she was staring straight ahead, almost like in a trance. I didn't think the car is the problem anymore.\n\n\"Good afternoon.\" Kept spacing out. \"Are you doing okay?\" Her head was rocking forward and backwards, and she slowly turned to look at me. \"I stopped you because you almost crashed into that other car. Are you diabetic?\" She looked at me and exhaled, as she started to say, \"Yeah, I have Diabetes, PTSD, bipolar...\" All slurred. That wasn't the smell of a diabetic episode. \"Go ahead and turn the car off and hand me the keys.\" She did so very slowly, and as she started to hand the keys to me, she pulled them back a bit, rethinking her decision. I grabbed them from her hands.\n\n\"Do you have a license or an ID on you?\" She handed me an ID. \"Wait in the car, I'll be right back.\" I went over the radio, \"Unit 2 to Dispatch, show me out on a stop. If you could start a second unit my way with a breath machine.\"\n\nI ran the ID. Five license suspensions for a combination of drunk driving and just driving with a suspended license. It was still suspended.\n\nI walked back up and started asking pre-field sobriety test questions. This person knew the routine, and gave me a lot of answers that would give me problems in court. \"Alright, I'm going to ask you to step out of the car to do some tests for me.\" She couldn't get out of the car. I basically carried her over to a nearby wall, one of her arms slung over me. She leaned against the wall to stay standing.\n\n\"I'm going to need you to stand with your heels and toes together, with your arms at your side, just like how I'm doing. Can you do that for me?\"\n\nShe mumbled back, \"No, no, I can't...I can't stand...\"\n\nI repeated, to make sure I heard it right, \"You can't stand?\" She shook her head. \"Okay, well, let's try blowing into a machine then.\" She knew this, too, and kept messing around while I tried getting a breath sample. I managed to get just enough to get a reading which was a new personal record for me. I placed her under arrest and impounded her car. \n\nWe got a blood sample, then went to the jail. I again walked her over to the entrance, where she fell backwards into a wall twice. The jail entry nurse said to me, \"She's too drunk. We're not going to take her. We don't have the medical staff for how bad she looks. You need to go to the other jail.\" During the car drive over there, she kept complaining about how she didn't do anything wrong, and didn't know why she was going to jail. Thirty minutes later, she was booked into the other jail.\n\nTwo days later she was let out. The DA wouldn't charge until the blood sample results came back. One week later they came back, showing a BAC of .43%. The legal limit is .08%. At her BAC, most people are dead. She got arrested for a warrant, held for a couple more days, and then bailed out.\n\nA couple days later, she got arrested again for driving suspended, and released. A couple days after that, she got arrested again for a hit and run, and released. A couple days after that, she went to jail for drunk driving again...and released.\n\nIn the span of less than two weeks, she was arrested and released four times. Last time I checked, she was still in jail. For some people, drunk driving is a one-time stupid mistake that's learned from and never repeated. For others, it's a way of life. I don't have the solution for the repeat offenders, but staying in jail seems like a good place to start.",

        "text": "Throwaway, because my other reddit account contains a lot of personal stuff. Story doesn't happen commonly I'm sure.\n\nPreface: I had recently been in serious amounts of trouble. Expelled from a class the previous year, suspended for fighting and a bunch of other stuff in year 6-8 (Also, mostly related to fighting). Regardless, I had a serious reputation for being a fighter. (I've since cleaned that behavior up.)\n\nTo the story!\n\nI was in PIF, which is code for Post-in French (Eg: Stupid People's French Class.) We were preparing for doing skits in groups. We were allowed to move anywhere within school grounds, even outside. Our guidelines included: We needed a girl character, a Lambo, and a 'fight scene'; how fitting for me. I had brought in my martial arts gear, as my other skit-mate had. We notified Admin what we were going to be doing, we didn't tell our SRO (School Resource Officer). Usually if something like this occurs, admin will call down to our teacher, confirm then report it to the SRO. He's an actual copper, not some $11/hr security guard. Gun, Taser, OC Spray, Nightstick, Uniform etc. We set up outside, in our costumes, and had prepared our \"fight scene\". (No harm was going to be inflicted of course.) We started recording and \"fighting\" right outside his office. BAD choice. Those doors opened faster then the speed of damn light. Cop is screaming at us to hit the ground (And we complied), cuffs me using his metal cuffs, and zip tied the other one.\n\nHe took me to his office, and my skit-mate to his VP. \n\nOfficer: \"Why are you two fighting? What's going on?\"\n\nMe: \"We're doing a skit for PIF. You can call our teacher and ask him. He knows about our plan, admin also knows about it. We thought they told you.......\"\n\nOfficer: \"Nope. So you two weren't actually fighting?\"\n\nMe: \"Nope.\"\n\nCops calls our teacher and admin into his office (Playing this out, what a good actor). He brought my skit mate into the room, and 'confirmed' our story. He of course removed our cuffs. Turns out, our third skit mate had told the Officer to come out, and pretend he didn't know.\n\nMade for some excellent footage. Our class found it hilarious. We ended up getting an A+ for our \"acting skills\", and for causing a stir in the school.\n\nIf you guys want to hear how I was expelled from school, and how the cops got involved, I'll post it here also. That's a much much longer story, that would be far more interesting (And cringy) to read.\n\n",

Riding along with a cop, getting to know him and policework in general, when he pulls behind a vehicle and tells me he's about to arrest a drunk driver.\n\nWe tail the driver, who is ever so gently bouncing around in his lane.  Right when Officer turns on the lights, the car pulls into a driveway.  Surprise surprise, it's actually the drivers driveway.  He's home.\n\nUnfortunately, he really is DUI.  He gets arrested in his own driveway.  It's dark out, the red and blues are making things pretty on the light snow, I'm kind of enjoying it, except for the wind and chill in the air.  Had to be about 30 degrees.\n\nOfficer puts the driver in the back.  Driver is super quiet and doesn't say anything, just wallowing in apparent sadness.  I look at him and say nothing, feeling bad for the guy realizing what a mistake he's made.\n\nOfficer gets back in the car with us to do some paperwork.  The squad car is facing the house when the driver's girlfriend decides it's time to investigate.  She was apparently eagerly awaiting the arrival of her man.\n\nMaybe a couple feet very tiny lingerie on a very beautiful six foot tall woman, walking right into our headlights.  The red and blues light up what little she's trying to hide behind a VERY flimsy sash and translucent silk robe, which is losing the battle with the gentle wind, despite her best efforts to keep things decent.  She pauses there in front of the car, all three of us staring at her and her at us.  She's obviously unsure if she should approach. She shivers in the cold while trying to keep her robe in place, fighting that wind, and failing miserably.\n\nOfficer and I slowly look at each other thinking, is this really happening?\n\nOfficer asks suspect, \"Do you know her?\"\n\n\"That's my girlfriend.\"  Suspect doesn't seem as enthused to see her as we are.\n\nShe had to be freezing and it was making her do a little hoppy-dance while trying to keep her robe closed, with the lights strobing, it was quite a sight.  Officer went out to talk to her as I did what a good rider does, observe.\n\nI thought, police work ain't so bad.\n\nI couldn't help myself while officer was talking to the suspects girlfriend.  I just look at the suspect and say, \"nice.\"\n\n\"...Thanks.\"",

As I responded from the other direction, it was done catching on fire and fully engulfed. Once I showed up, another Trooper on his drive home had stopped to assist, and no one was hurt, but the fire was still raging. The other Trooper advised he believed one of the involved drivers was drunk, since the smell of alcohol was coming from that car. Now it's a drunk driving multiple car crash with a fire, and that's not a fun report.\n\n\"Unit 2 to Dispatch, we've got the whole freeway stopped. Can Fire advise an ETA?\"\n\n\"Dispatch to Unit 2, Fire advised drive time from where they are.\"\n\n\"Unit 2...thanks for that. Start a tow truck, please. It'll be for the burned hulk.\"\n\nI spoke to the group of people that the other Trooper thought was drunk. They were all young, with only the driver being of legal drinking age. And talking to them, I smelled a lot of alcohol. I had the driver step aside and talk to me alone so I could get a better read on how drunk he was. While he was away from the group, the smell of alcohol disappeared, and he gave no indicators of drinking. I wasn't at the scene to investigate underage drinking while I had a major four lane freeway shut down, so I didn't investigate that any further.\n\nThe firefighters showed up and extinguished the vehicle, while I got all the information from the other involved parties and got them on their way. About 30 minutes had passed now, and the tow truck was required to be there within 20.\n\n\"Dispatch to Unit 2, the tow is advising they can't locate you. Can you give an updated location?\"\n\n\"Unit 2, I copy.\" And I'm annoyed. \"Tell them to look for the car that is now a burned hulk and has the entire freeway stopped. I'll think they'll be able to find us.\"\n\n\"Dispatch to Unit 2, I copy that.\" Dispatch relayed that exact message to them. They found us five minutes later.",

        "text": "I live in Alberta, Canada. I was at supper with my parents and a family friend in a small town that's about 30 min to the nearest hospital. I drove us in my friends vehicle since she didn't know the area and my dad met us at the restaurant on his motorbike.  \n  \nMy mum had been having some crazy hot flashes as a side effect of her post-cancer medications and felt one coming on so she decided to go outside, we think nothing of it, she's been dealing with wicked hot flashes for months. What we didn't know is that she sat inside the hot vehicle, on a hot day, on top of the hot flash - not a good combo. Next thing I know my Mum is standing in the entrance way and can barely walk and she's violently shaking her hands by her chest. My dad runs over &amp; she says we need to go to the hospital. I ask if we should call 911 and my dad, in his panic, just says \"no, we just need to get her to the hospital, it'll be quicker to drive her\". (He's not wrong, it would be quicker, we were a good 30 min from any hospital, but we should have called them... next time we sure will be!).  \n\nWe all pile into the friend's vehicle; I have to be the driver, she's had a couple of beers, and my dad is focused on my Mum. So we get onto the highway, it's a straight road from the town to the hospital, I'm booting it down the road, doing 40km/h over the limit, I don't have to pass a single car, roads are bare &amp; clear, I'm about 10 min from the hospital and I come up on a white SUV. I'm about to pass him (in a passing zone) and I see it's sheriff. Crap.  His lights go on immediately. Double crap. \n  \nIn order to slow down enough and pull over safely I end up passing him and pulling over right away onto the shoulder. He finally gets out, comes to my window and barks \"Do you have any idea how fast you were going!?\" I immediately burst into tears (I didn't mean to, but we were all panicked about my Mum, I'm thinking she's having a stroke and I'm freaked right out). I explain that my Mum needs to get to a hospital and we need to get her there NOW. He strolls over to my mum's side of the car (she's in the back seat with my dad), he starts asking questions and my dad is in fight mode and he's mad, we need to get there and this guy is only slowing us down. He talks to my Mum getting her breathing slowed and her &amp; my dad calmed a bit. Then he goes to his car, we wait what feels like forever. He comes out finally and asks why I'm driving, we explain that friend has had a couple drinks, I hadn't and my dad was taking care of my mum. After what felt like forever (was likely only 5 minutes) he finally tells us he's called an ambulance and that he's a trained EMT and he thinks my Mum is just having a panic attack and hyperventilated which can cause your extremities to seize up &amp; shake. He tells me that he's keeping my license and will meet up with me at the hospital.  \n  \nWe sit there for 30 min waiting for the ambulance.  It finally gets there, the EMT's assure us she's going to be okay and they'll meet us at the hospital. Sheriff comes up to my window and I promise to him I'll obey the speed limit and will meet him at the hospital. He says \"Don't do that again, next time call 911.\" I swear up and down that I will in the future. He then hands me my license and says \"by the way, nice driving, but seriously - don't do that again.\" Yes officer! So no ticket, even though I totally deserved one. And in the future I'll definitely be calling 911 in any emergency. I was so grateful of his change of heart and sure appreciate them, they sure have a thankless job some days. He requested I call him later once we knew how my Mum was, I did later that evening.   \n  \nMy mum is okay, it was a panic attack and hyperventilated (first time she's ever had that happen, apparently it's a side effect of the cancer drugs); She had some erratic heart rates at the hospital so they had her wear a monitor for 24 hours and she's now on some different cancer meds &amp; blood pressure meds.

        "text": "Today I was driving to lunch with my girlfriend, Taylor, and one of my other friends, Andy. On the way to the restaurant, there is a 2 lane each way road with a few red lights. The speed limit is either 30 or 35, I can't remember for sure. Either way, there's is a long straight stretch that starts at one light and goes about 3/8 of a mile to another light. This section of the road also opens up with 2 extra turn lanes going each way. At its widest point, the road is 7 lanes across. Keep in mind the 30mph speed limit. \n\nAbout a mile before we get to the long straight, I drive up behind two cars that look like the typical ricey Civic. I'm a bit of a car guy, and at the moment I own a Mitsubishi Evo with around 600hp. It's fucking fast. Just in the spirit of having a fast car, I occasionally accelerate up to my cruising speed faster than usual. Nothing out of control, nothing too ridiculous, just a little spirited driving. \n\nThe mile leading up to the straight stretch, the Civics keep pulling away quick and slowing down. If you've ever been in a car with a teenager, you know this is one of the universal signs to race. \n\nWe pull up to the next red light, windows down. Kid seems confident. He has no idea what he's getting himself into. The road is fairly empty, with no cars on the road between lights. It's now or never. \n\nLight turns green, we go. I take off slow and easy, and when we gets about 2 car lengths in front of me, that's when I decided it was enough playing around. I punched the gas, built a little boost, and was past him in a second. I only pulled from around 20-50, slowing down right after. \n\nSure enough, few seconds later see the cop in my mirror. I pull over and wait for him to come to the window. He approaches the window and gave the usual \"license, insurance, registration\" spiel. He didn't even bother telling me why he stopped me. He knew I knew. \n\nHe goes back to the cruiser to do his checks and I assume write me a reckless driving ticket. He comes back 5 minutes later, nothing in hand. He looked at me and said \"You know how many citations I could have just written you? About 5. But you know why I'm not? Because I was young and dumb too.

        "text": "There's an unwritten rule in my agency: if a Trooper yells at someone for something they can go to jail for or get a ticket for, they get a warning. But if a Trooper takes someone to jail or gives them a ticket, the Trooper is 100% professional and courteous to them the whole time. Typically, the yelling is only because you're in a situation where you don't have the time to write a ticket, but need the offender to understand they seriously messed up. Here's a quick yelling story.\n\nMy beat partner Johnson and I got a call to a disabled van in the center divide of the freeway. The van was disabled before a tunnel that had two entrances, separated by a median. So if you were in one entrance, you had no idea what was going on in the other side, but they reconnected at the exit. I told Johnson I'd stop the right entrance so he could safely push the van over to the next exit. This particular tunnel had a pretty significant incident a few years prior where a handful of people died in a car crash and subsequent explosion because they blindly entered the tunnel. That made it pretty important that I get traffic stopped.\n\nBefore the entrance to the tunnel was an on-ramp. I started a traffic break with my lights and sirens, weaving across the lanes, creating a hole in traffic as everyone slowed down behind me. Even if you had never seen this before, you could figure out pretty easily what my intentions were. I'll do them 3 or 4 times a day and they usually go off without a problem.\n\nSo everyone slowed down...except a car taking the on-ramp. She merged on right behind my traffic break, while I was still weaving, and still had my lights and sirens on. As she merged on, she tried to pass me on the shoulder, on my right, which was illegal in a multitude of ways. I cut her off, and kept doing my break. I let Johnson know the tunnel was clear.\n\nAs I was still doing my break, I saw the lady who tried to pass me on my right was now on my rear bumper, trying to pass me on my left. So I brake-checked her.\n\nA couple seconds later, I observed that she was still a couple feet behind me, completely missing the point.\n\nI stopped my car. I got out. I pointed at her, and yelled, **\"STAY BACK!! THE LAW SAYS 400 FEET WHEN MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS ARE ON!\"** There may have been a four letter word mixed in there.\n\nShe yelled out her window, \"I don't understand?\"\n\nI mumbled, \"I figured that much out.\"\n\nI got back in my car and continued on, slowly, so Johnson could get the stranded driver to safety. And that driver stayed waaaaaaay behind me after that.\n\n\n[The first minute of this video pretty much sums up the story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvQTeU0_akM)\n\n",

        "text": "My first time submitting here. Let me know how my writing is, and how I should improve.\n\nSo after about a year of being an EMT, I finally figured out that the dingy flashlight I picked up at the dollar store shortly after getting hired just wasn’t cutting it. Sure, it was a dollar, but a single match light up a wider area than the cheap piece of junk I had. Plus, I finally had a little money for myself after supplying my college fund. So I went out, and like all new EMTs, bought myself the biggest, coolest flashlight I could find. I sprung for one of those big ass Pelican style lights; the ones that are neon yellow, have a fancy on/off switch, and were even waterproof. Babes can’t resist an EMT with a waterproof flashlight, right?    (Turns out they can. Anyhow…).\n\n\nI had a little trouble finding a place to keep it. No, the supplied belt clip didn’t do a real good job of keeping it…anywhere. After a week of me leaving it on the truck and then complaining loudly about not having my shiny new light, one of the department elders took mercy upon me and gifted me a little nylon flashlight holder. Just a little piece of cloth that I could put on my belt and loop the light through. It was just like the cops had! Determined not to forget my light ever again, I took the little paracord leash on the end of the light, and clipped it to me with a carabiner. Now my flashlight and I were inseparable!\n\n\nUntil one day. A call came in for a fall, on a sidewalk, with injuries unknown. A police officer had witnessed a woman fall, and requested “A bus”. We didn’t have much more than that – but if our cops were calling us, it was legit. We hustled there, and found two newer officers kneeling next to a woman on the ground. One of them walked over and gave me a hand with the bags, something I appreciate. The patient said something – I didn’t hear what. With my hands free, I bent over, and felt my flashlight start to slid out of the cheapo holder. *Ain’t nobody got time for that*, I figured, *I’ll just let it fall*. Patient care comes first, after all. I forgot the about the leash. It dropped off my belt, the carabiner caught it and it swung – like a pendulum – right into her head.\n\n\nSo that folks, is how the entire police department knows me as ‘Brainiac’. For those wondering, the patient was fine. She ended up not accepting a ride to the hospital, just an ice pack and a sincere apology. My punishment? Wearing a helmet everywhere for the rest of the week. I sure did learn a lesson: leave the flashlight on the truck.\n",

My truck was my toolbox, and it was not uncommon for me to be working a significant distance from where my truck was parked, so I normally carried enough common small tools on me that I usually did a good job at filling the basket when I had to go through a metal detector. Among these were a Leatherman multitool and a small (2.5\" blade) pocketknife on my belt.\n\nI also happened to work in an area with a particularly high concentration of federal government buildings and defense contractors. The knives were almost never a problem. It was way more common for me to have to ditch my phones for some reason (it didn't help that when we switched phone carriers, my company ordered the standard flip phones -- with cameras). There was one three-letter agency in particular where the guard would regularly flip my knife open and check the blade length against a ruler taped onto the X-ray, but this was also the site where about half the times I showed up nobody had taken care of getting me cleared to enter...\n\nOne day I'm sent out to a telecom site that shared a building with some sort of federal government tenant. The latter meant that inside the service entrance was a metal detector and X-ray. I'm there for a PM inspection on a transfer switch, which is the thing that automatically starts and switches to the generator when utility power fails.\n\nFirst trip in the building, I roll in and unload the contents of my pockets and belt in a basket and toss it in the X-ray with my toolbox. The guard immediately objects to my multitool and knife. I figure, okay, I've got my toolbox so I don't need them, I'll just leave them in the truck. Not worth fighting over.\n\nI'm rolling through the PM checklist, which I'm not familiar with at that point (it wasn't something we normally did) and at one point it called for a thermal scan of the switch to check for any bad electrical connections. Now, even if I knew about this part beforehand, there's no way in hell the shop is going to let me borrow the expensive FLIR camera for this sort of thing (if they had even bought it at that point), so I'm stuck sweeping the switch with my infrared thermometer. Back out to the truck I go.\n\nI grab the case from my truck and head back inside. I know I'm in for even more fun than last time, because [this sort of thing](http://i.imgur.com/5KYY3W7.jpg) isn't going to look particularly innocent inside of an X-ray... I explain what it is, pull it out of the case to show the guard (shouldn't you be the one doing that?), and head inside to finish the job.\n\nFortunately, that was the only time I had to go inside at that site.",

Turns out that it was actually true in this case, partially. The tenants were a man and his elderly mother. They were keeping the man's developmentally challenged brother padlocked in the mother-in-law suite of the house with no plumbing or electricity.\n\nThis family had been doing a \"rent-to-own\" thing with the landlord for ten years or so, and only recently stopped paying. Turns out that they had been feeding the brother through the mail slot in the suite's door, and the interior had no furniture besides the most disgusting mattress you can imagine. We don't know how long he had been kept in there, but I have never seen a more revolting place in my entire life.\n\nI don't actually know how this case ended.

        "text": "This story happend when I was 18 - so a long time ago ? - but I still remember my sense of \"WTF?\". I am not a good writer - if anything is unclear, let me know :D\n\n**Backstory**: I was studying French in a summer program in Cannes, travelling by myself, staying in a small apartment provided by the school. The apartment was located....not in a tourist area ? Very large apartment blocks, old cars and just very lived in area.\n\n**Story** : Around 11pm, I was walking home from a late night school event (open house). I was the only person on the street, almost to the parking lot around my house - nobody around - when a dog barked just once and scared the crap out of me! What freaked me out more was someone going \"Sussh!\". I looked around me - convinced I was finally cracking and hearing voices - there was no one there.\n\nI kept looking around as I got to the parking lot - no dog nor human - just cars parked.\n\n **Sidebar** - This was in 1999, France and I did not own a cell phone. But there was a phone booth in the middle of the parking lot outside my building.\n\n**Story cont.**Since I knew that my parents would be awake, I decided to call home to Iceland. As I was talking, I saw a police officer walk past the booth, heading up to the entrence around the back of the building. \n\nNot worried.\n\nBut a few seconds later, I see two officers and one of them had a dog with him - great ! Not going crazy - I had heard a dog bark for real. These two (3?) officers are just hanging around waiting for something - or someone.\n\nNot worried - on the phone : \"Sure Mom, it is totally safe around here!\"\n\nNow there is a police cruiser driving into the parking lot - stopping by the 2 officers with the dog - and then driving a further on.\n\nStill on the phone - not worried at all.\n\nBut as I am talking with my parents, even more police officers are hanging around the parking lot, two more police cruisers and now a police van is pulling up..they are opening the doors, their radios are crackling, the men are getting more alert.\n\nAnd from behind my building, there are two officers holding on each side of...the bastard child of the Hulk ? The guy looked like he hadn't fallen out the trees too long ago - proto human. He was clearly handcuffed because his hands were infront but under a jacket. Behind him was a small group of armed police in tactical gear.\n\nOh hell ! Now I was worried as I was telling my dad \"No, nothing much happens here in Cannes - it is pretty safe!\"\n\nWell, the police finish placing the \"bad guy\" into the van. Slam ! It took the police maybe couple of minutes to clear everyone out - and I am still on the phone and to this day, I have no clue what this guy did or if I accidentally stumbled into a bust of some kind. \n\nIt seems that the dog and his handler were somewhat hidden when I walked past them and the dog gave a single warning bark and his handler was the one who susshed. \n\nI wonder what the police was thinking of the girl staring at them in the phone booth - eyes getting bigger by every passing second.\n\n*I have to admit - Police freak me out more than bad guys. I was once working in a small supermarket and one of my cashiers was held up by a guy with a knife. The other cashier ran back to me and I called the police. I went back into the store to check on the cashier - that was not a problem for me. What freaked me out was dealing with the police - both giving the statements and dealing with the victim assistance guy (after two phone calls I had to tell him to stop calling). But I love reading the stories on this thread and I respect peace officers and their work - you just terrify me.*\n\n",

I was cruising along the highway trying to plan in my head the best route home. I could stay on the highway however it gets bad when you go up the mountain or I could go the scenic route. As I neared the exit something in my head told me, do not take the highway so I exited at a brisk 5 MPH. Running through the twisting roads as the road shimmered from the snow and ice, it made me think I had taken the wrong path.\nAs I crested up over a bridge 3 towns over, it goes down hill and curves at the bottom then goes back up hill. I did not even process it would be a bad spot until I got to the top. By time I realized it, there was nothing I could do but to hold on for the ride. The ass end of my van slid out from under me and was in the opposite lane of travel. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see other vehicles through the trees coming up the hill. Immediately time slowed and I thought, I have two choices try to save it and go head on or slam it into the guard rail and only hurt myself. I chose to slam the guard rail, I heard SMASH! as I hit and bounced off. I missed the first two cars coming the opposite direction however one dove into the ditch I was aiming for.\n\nWe made sure each other was ok then contacted 911. They stated that at this time all officers were tied up and to pull apart, trade info, and go our separate ways. Easier said than done, as my bumper was twisted up inside his quarter panel. We tried pulling apart and our vehicles were not having it. Also, I am disabled and my vehicle is heavily modified, so I wanted a police report. Que us calling 911 for the second time to be told state police had been notified ETA 2 hours.\n\nAfter 20 mins an off-duty volunteer fire fighter shows up and turns his blue lights on. Walks up and makes sure we are ok and almost goes ass over tin cups due to the road conditions. He contacts dispatch.\n\nFD: hey dispatch, this is firefighter from (blablabla) can you send out FD on (blablabla) road for a vehicle accident, no injuries partially on the road way, this hill is slick and someone may do the same thing this guy did and hit us.\n\nDispatch: Negative, State Police has been notified ETA 1:30 mins.\n\nFD looked up the road and goes gentlemen how long has that car been sitting on the hill?\nI was like o that was one of the cars I passed when I was spinning. They may have crapped themselves and stopped and can't get going again. FD walked up and talked to them then slid back down to us.\n\nFD: Hey dispatch, I also have a vehicle stuck that is now a traffic hazard half way up the hill. I am again requesting FD to be dispatched for traffic control.\n\nDispatch: Negative, DOT spotter trucks are trying to find the accident they will advise road conditions when on scene. \n\nAn hour and 15 mins later spotter trucks still have not arrived and we see flashing lights in the distance. State trooper vehicle pulls in behind us. FD guy and the person I hit walked back to his car. After about 10 mins Trooper 1 approaches my vehicle.\n\nTrooper 1: Sir, how fast were you going? It doesn't seem slippy to meeeeeeeeeee!\n\nTrooper 1 goes ass over tin cups as his right leg slides out from under him, almost making him do a split.\n\nTrooper 1: Never mind sir, you hang tight I will write up the report saying accident was due to icy conditions. Can I have your license, registration, and proof of insurance? \nHe immediately keys up dispatch.\n\nTrooper 1: Dispatch, ETA for DOT? I want this road shut down if they are not here in 5 mins.\n\nAs he is talking to dispatch in the distance you can see a flashing yellow light. Never fear DOT is here. It was a spotter truck for the county I live in. Guy stated all his plow trucks were empty and had to return to base to get more salt. Just as the trooper keyed his mic to talk to dispatch the DOT driver's radio went off.\n\nOther counties DOT: Hi yall we been listening in and figured we could help. I have 4 trucks fully loaded with salt ETA 2 mins. \n\nThey came across the county line plowing and spreading salt. Trooper walks back to me and goes I have a tow truck on the way but I want you to do me a favor turn your wheel hard left and punch it. This led to shearing and popping noises as my bumper ripped away from the guys vehicle. Trooper walked up and goes here is your information, here is your accident report. We apologize for taking so long we had a multiple car collision on the highway it had 3 life flights. You have yourself a nice night, pull away when you are ready.\nI have always enjoyed my encounters with the state police, they are very professional. However, our local cops are a story for another time.\n\nEdit: I deleted the state to conform with the rules.",

I thought he was going down the little ramp so I stepped directly into the path he was actually trying to drive through and then I dragged J by the collar with me and stood there, looking dumbly into the windshield of the car with the bright flashing lights, right in front of it. After what was way too long, I probably delayed this officer too much, but I managed to stumble out of the way (I was not drunk or high or anything, I'm just a clumsy/derpy person). He zips by with what I can only imagine as \"some idiot just walked in front of my car and I lost precious time because of it\". Anyways... we make it to the place with my friends band. We end up talking to him a bit and then leaving. We ate ice cream and hot dogs and started walking back. \nAs we're approaching the exact same sidewalk I made my idiotness show, what do I see? Another squad car. We started laughing because it was a funny coincidence and he stopped beside us:\nOfficer: what are you so guilty about?\nMe: well like 4 hours ago I accidentally stood in front of a cop car who was probably trying to get somewhere important and here I am in the exact spot now with you. \nOfficer: oh yeah! I heard about that! That was you?\nJ: that was him! And he pushed me in front too!\nOfficer: well um have a good night \n*drives off*\nJ: dude\nMe: he heard about it?! Oh my god I'm an idiot\nJ: yeah. ",

Until that, I had considered myself lucky because they are notorious for being strict.\n\nI knew it was because of my license plate being expired. It's pretty far gone, just haven't had the money to pay the sales tax on it yet, so I can't renew. \n\nI'm a nervous person, a small girl. I've had only good experiences with police, save for once.

He could probably feel it when he stamped his fingers on my tail light.\n\nA few weeks before this, I was stopped and issued a ticket for the same thing, my expired plates. Well when Mr cop came up, he told me he stopped me for my plates. He then asked if I even knew they were expired. I am already panicking and blurt out a no sir!  before I can think. He took my license and insurance to his car and it was then that I realized. Oh shit. I just recently got pulled over for it. I got a ticket and everything.

But he came back and just before I was about to bring it up myself and apologize, he said he was giving me a written warning and to take care of it asap. \n\nAs he handed back my license, I realized in my panic I had given him an old one that expired in 2012.

Angry enough to stomp up the road in his jeans and t-shirt in 18 degree weather. One of our local off duty guys was driving by in his truck and stopped to see if he was ok, nope obviously not ok, half a block up an on duty (who our lovely off duty had called) pulled up, ragin Teen is Ragin! Local guys (now up to 3 on duty rigs, 2 off duty rigs, plus paramedics on the way, and off duty emt on the premises) Ragin Teen brings both fists down on the hood of the car, they offer to tase him to make him sit on the ground, and end up having to cuff Ragin Teen and put him in the car. \n\nThis is post wisdom teeth removal, so spit mask over the head because he'd pulled the cotton out and every time he said anything he was spewing blood. It took all of them to get him into the ambulance when it got there, so they could transport him to the ER in the next town (no hospital in Town A.)  Lovely Officer the First in his offical rig, was kind enough to drive me to the hospital as well, since according to Ragin Teen this was all my fault! and he didn't WANT me! \n\nThey had to use haldol (?) on him in the ER to knock him out long enough to sober him up. Lovely Officer who drove me came out to assure me, there were no charges, they understood. Said the blood spitting wasn't malicious just had happened. It was like him drinking a 12 pack he wasn't in control. (which I already knew the drugs had done it to him but it was sweet none the less.) Ragin teen hadn't even dented the hood thank you Lord. \n\nThank you to the kick ass officers who put up with crazy Ragin Teens, and have the wisdom to know the difference between Ragin without Knowing and Ragin to Hurt.\n\n\nI forgot to Tag :( I was thinking Flair not Tag.

        "text": "Before I became a Trooper, I had no idea the kind of crazy lawlessness that happened on highways. I knew people would speed, or tailgate, or make unsafe lane changes, but that was about it. Once I became a Trooper, I learned those people who drove with complete disregard for traffic laws had a complete disregard for all laws. Usually if I stop someone for breaking one law, I've found they're breaking more.\n\nI was working on an open, mostly empty stretch of the freeway. I spotted smoke in the distance, filling up 3 lanes of traffic, coming from the other direction. That usually indicates lots of heavy braking, a crash, or a brush fire. As I passed it, I could see it was an older tow truck towing a dump truck. And the dump truck had its back tires locked and smoking. Traffic normally flows at 65-70mph in that area, and it was all back up at 35mph. I turned around to make a stop on the truck, expecting it to be gone by the time I got there.\n\nIt was still there, dragging the dump truck, locked wheels and billowing smoke. The driver pulled over immediately. I got out of my car, and just stood behind it while the smoke poured out, waiting for it to clear so I didn't breath it in. After about 30 seconds, I could see it wasn't smoking any less.\n\n\"Unit 7 to Dispatch, Fire request.\"\n\n\"Dispatch to Unit 7, Go ahead with your fire request.\"\n\n\"Unit 7, I'm on a stop on westbound I-20, east of Salem, with a tow truck towing a dump truck. The dump truck has locked brakes and it's billowing smoke out. Negative flames at this time.\" Dispatch started the fire department. The fire fighters eventually showed up, and it took them 30 minutes of hosing the brakes down before they stopped smoking.\n\nWhile I was on the radio with dispatch, the tow truck driver got out and walked back towards me. He was not what I would describe as a well-groomed gentleman. If I saw him on the sidewalk, I'd think he was homeless.\n\nThe whole scene had me flabbergasted that he would keep towing when it was obvious there was a problem. I gestured to the smoke, and the first thing I said to him was, \"Come on, man.\"\n\nHe replied, \"I know. It's just a stuck caliper. I've only got half a mile to go to reach my exit.\"\n\nI got his ID card, as he didn't have a driver's license. He also didn't have insurance. And he didn't have registration. He was setting up to have a bad day. Let's review the laws he's now broken:\n\n1. Driving while unlicensed.\n\n2. Towing without the proper endorsement.\n\n3. No insurance.\n\n4. No registration.\n\n5. Impeding traffic.\n\n6. Unsafe tow load.\n\nThe first two you can go to jail for, and a combination of a few of those earned your car jail time (an impound).\n\nI called my sergeant. \"Hey Sarge, can I tow a tow truck that's towing another truck if the driver is unlicensed?\" I had never done it before, but I figured I could.\n\n\"Can you? Yes. Should you? Probably not.\" He went on to explain that it'd take about an hour to get a tow truck that could tow all that, and we were short staffed, and we had protests and riots that had been going on recently, and it didn't make sense for me to be tied up that long in case crowds started building and the local police needed backup. The amount of stuff people can get away with because we're spread so thin is often frustrating.\n\nI gave the driver two misdemeanor (criminal) violations, and one infraction (fine only). I then gave him a lawful order to get a driver with a valid endorsement to arrive on scene, and get the truck off the freeway at the next exit.\n\nAnd you'd think that'd be it, and he'd learn, and he'd get his stuff together.\n\n...two weeks later, I was patrolling near that same area, this time in regular rush hour traffic. I glanced to my right, and saw an old tow truck to my right. I did a double-take, realizing it was the same old tow truck from the prior incident, this time not towing anything. I didn't see it breaking any moving violations, but I remembered that the registration wasn't paid for. I ran the plate. The registration was still expired; 5 years overdue. I pulled him over.\n\nI walked up to contact the driver, and found...someone else. \"Good afternoon, sir. I stopped you...\" He interrupted, \"I know, it's that flat tire I've got. I'm going to a yard to get it swapped out now.\"\n\n\"I didn't see any flat tire, but that's a problem, too. I actually stopped you because I stopped this exact same truck two weeks ago, and it had expired registration then, and it has expired registration now.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was you? Yeah, my boss told me about that.\" I had the driver hand me the keys. We were fully staffed that day, there were no protests going on, and that truck was getting impounded. I checked the driver's license, and while he had one, he didn't have one for the class he needed for a truck that big. I asked him why he was driving it.\n\n\"My boss asked me if I had a driver's license, and I said I did. I guess he didn't know, and I didn't know, that we needed a special one.\" That almost seemed reasonable, except that this tow truck was big enough to tow a school bus, and I gave his boss a ticket for the same thing two weeks prior.\n\nI dropped the driver off at a safe location, and circled back around to complete the tow form. While inspecting the truck, I noticed the registration stickers on the license plate. They were current, meaning they were fraudulently put on there. I guess if you don't care about one law, you might as well not care about any of them.",

        "text": "Years ago, I worked as a security officer in a high-traffic tourist area (graveyard shift).  \n\nOne of my responsibilities was to make sure my building's loading/unloading zone is kept clear because at all hours of the day we've got vehicles coming and going for people going to meetings, visitors, tourists, cabs, etc.  The curb is painted white and marked in big bold letters ***LOADING AND UNLOADING ONLY NO PARKING***.  At the end of the zone there was a single handicap parking stall painted bright blue.\n\nNow the building I worked at was nearby a few large night clubs, so every Friday and Saturday the area would be crazy busy with drunken fighting, vomiting, occasional alleyway sex, etc.  All night long there'd be cute girls milling around in skimpy outfits, so the job had its perks too.\n\nClubbers would take advantage of my building's valet parking service and pay to park in our garage before heading out to one of the clubs across the street.\n\nSome clubbers would think they could get away with parking in our loading zone all night.  My coworkers and I would aggressively patrol the area in the earlier evening hours and advise as many people as we could so they'd leave and avoid getting a ticket.  It was also better for us if they left, because when there were too many vehicles parked out front, traffic would become a complete clusterfuck regardless of the time of day.\n\nMost people would be grateful for the information and leave.  Occasionally, some douche would laugh in our faces, say something about pigs or rent-a-cops or whatever and leave their car anyway.  In those cases, we'd call our city's parking enforcement and they'd get a $90 ticket for their troubles.\n\nOne Saturday night, after finished a round of patrols, I went to take a leak.  On my way back out, I walked past Dispatch and my buddy calls me over to the surveillance bank.\n\n\"Hey bro, you got one out front.\"\n\nI turned to the grainy feed just in time to see a piece-of-junk '97 BMW sloppily parking in front of our building.  I murmured that I'd go out and advise the driver, but before I could leave, the driver exited his vehicle.\n\nMy buddy and I watched in silence as the driver, a young black male adorned with flashy cheap bling, hiked his pants up at the crotch and blocked the path of a couple girls walking by.  He started hitting on them in the slimiest way possible, even trying to grab their hands and asses at one point, staring shamelessly at their tits while he was schmoozing them.  He took out his phone and shoved it at them, presumably asking for their numbers.\n\nEventually the girls were able to dodge his grabbers and ran off toward the club across the street.  He repeated this routine several more times with various groups of girls walking by, even taking out a small bottle of vodka from his back pocket and offering swigs.  With each rejection, he'd get angry and presumably cuss out the girls as they hurried off (our cameras didn't pick up audio but this seemed a reasonable assumption).\n\nI sighed and looked at my buddy.\n\n\"Well, I guess I'll go talk to him.\"\n\nI made my way out to the front and approached him just as another group of girls ducked away from him.  I called out to him.  He turned and stared at me blankly.\n\n\"Hey, man, just wanted to let you know that this zone is for loading and unloading.  Normally it's not a big deal to park for a bit but if everyone does it on the weekends, traffic gets backed up pretty bad here.\"\n\nThe douche looked at his vehicle, then at my badge.\n\n\"FUCKYOUBITCHASSNIGGAI'LLFUCKYOUUP.  PIGASSWANNABECOPMOTHAFUCKA.\"\n\nI looked at my watch.  It was about 10:30PM.  I continued my spiel.\n\n\"Parking enforcement here is pretty strict.  You should move your vehicle or you might get ticketed--\"\n\n\"FUCKYOUNIGGASUCKMYDICK.  BETTERNOTTOUCHMYSHITNIGGAILLFUCKYOUUPNIGGA.\"\n\n\"Have a good night sir.\"\n\nHe flipped me off and went across the street, where he was promptly denied entry for dress code violations.  He cussed out the bouncer and wandered off down the block.  I walked over to his vehicle and saw that it was parked crooked, the rear of the vehicle partially blocking the lane of traffic.  Half of his vehicle was in the white zone, the other in the blue zone.  I key'd up my radio.\n\n\"8million to dispatch.\"\n\n\"8million, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Can you call parking enforcement for this vehicle?  Lemme know when you're ready for the plate.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, the parking officer arrived.  He looked at the vehicle and promptly issued a $90 ticket for parking in the white zone and a $900 ticket for parking in the blue zone without a permit.\n\nI thanked the officer and went back inside to have a snack.\n\nA couple hours later, two of the local cops stopped by to say hi.  As [Officer Morris](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/5ul02o/witness_stutterinducer/) and his partner walked over, Dispatch radio'd me.\n\n\"Hey 8million, is that Jones and Morris?\"\n\n\"Sure is.\"\n\n\"You gonna do what I think you're gonna do?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nOfficer Jones and I lit up our cigarettes as Officer Morris looked on disapprovingly.  We all smoked and chatted for a bit, then I casually motioned over my shoulder at the BMW.\n\n\"Hey, Jones, check out the parking job on that piece of shit.\"\n\nWe all walked over to the corner and looked at the vehicle, the two tickets stuck on the windshield flapping in the wind.  Officer Morris grabbed one of the tickets, read it over and looked at me.\n\n\"What's the story here?\"\n\nI told them what happened and the driver's response.  Officer Jones and Morris looked at each other.\n\n\"8million, you got the time?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's... 12:27AM.\"\n\n\"Well it's a whole new day now isn't it?\"\n\nOfficer Morris proceeded to write another $90 ticket for the white zone, then another $900 ticket for the blue zone.  He paused for a moment after finishing the second one.\n\n\"Hey Jones, looks like this vehicle is parked more than twelve inches from the curb.  What do you think?\"\n\n\"Sounds about right.\"\n\nOfficer Morris wrote another ticket for $120 and slapped it on the pile of tickets on the windshield.  I shook both officer's hands and they left to continue their patrols.\n\nThe next few hours of my shift went by fairly quickly.  Around 5AM, Dispatch scared the hell out of me.\n\n\"HEY 8MILLION, ARE YOU STILL ON THAT CALL?\"\n\n\"Negative, I just finished clearing it.\"\n\n\"RESPOND TO DISPATCH ASAP.\"\n\nI ran down to the surveillance bank, where my coworkers were all gathered and laughing their asses off.  Sunday was street cleaning day and the BMW was getting ticketed again by parking enforcement.\n\nAfter that, we all stopped by Dispatch every 5-10 minutes to see if the owner had returned.  Finally, at about 6AM, douchebag came stumbling up the block, looking completely worn out.  His formerly-white t-shirt was stained and dirty and it looked like he'd lost at least one fight.\n\nWe watched in suspense as he looked at the pile of tickets crammed together on his windshield and slowly removed them.  He stood there, pants sagging below his knees, shuffling through each ticket as if he were a toddler with a handful of Pokémon cards.\n\nWith a look of abject defeat on his face, he got into his vehicle and drove off.  The whole room erupted in laughter and high-fives.\n\nAs the laughter died down, I picked up the office phone and started dialing.  My coworkers eyed me curiously.  I put the call on speaker just as the call connected.\n\n\"9-1-1, what is your emergency?\"\n\n\"Yeah, hi, I'd like to report a possible drunk driver.  I have the vehicle and driver description when you're ready.\"",

        "text": "This occurred back when I was still on Field Training (FTO). Field Training is the period of time where you've just graduated from the academy, but you have a training Trooper in the car with you to make sure you don't screw anything up too badly. The paradox is that sometimes the training Troopers themselves are screw ups.\n\nWith this particular training Trooper, she wanted me to be more commanding. It my view, she wanted me to be more ruthless. She had previously told me that if someone is smoking when she stops them, she would tell them to put their cigarette out because it was rude of them. We were on a stop a day before, and she tried really hard to get a driver to cry. She taught me some other things that were outside of policy, that I never did once I got away from her. She never did anything illegal, but would regularly be rude and do things that could result in disciplinary action against her.\n\nThe unfortunate reality of FTO is that you need to do what your instructor tells you to do, or wants you to do, or you get fired. The agency will take the word of a Trooper with 5+ years on over the guy with 1+ month, every time. And usually that's the right thing to do.\n\nI stopped a car because it didn't have any license plates on it. Upon contacting the driver, I noticed he was smoking. Heeding my instructor's advice, I asked the driver, \"Would you mind putting your cigarette out for me?\" Notice I said this as a request, and the driver had no requirement to comply. The driver looked left for a place to dispose of it. The driver looked right. The driver looked left again, and threw it out their open window, into the street. That was a poor choice on their part.\n\nI couldn't believe what I just saw, so I asked him, \"Did you just throw that out the window?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Yeah, you told me to throw it out.\"\n\n\"No, I asked you to *put* it out, not throw it out. Those are very different things.\"\n\n\"Well I didn't have anywhere else to put it!\"\n\n\"So what were you planning on doing with it when you were done?\"\n\nHe stammered, and didn't have any explanation. Even if I didn't ask him to put it out, he was probably going to use the street as his ash tray anyway.\n\nRegarding the license plate, the driver had them in his car, and just didn't feel like putting them on to avoid tolls.\n\nI walked back to my car, with my instructor waiting. \"Are you going to write him?\" I told her I was. I also mentioned the cigarette out the window. My instructor asked, \"Are you going to write him for that, too?\" I didn't really want to...but I knew what my instructor wanted me to do. So I replied, \"Absolutely.\" My instructor's eyes widened with joy, as she exclaimed, \"Alright!\"\n\nI wrote the guy a ticket for the cigarette (littering) and the lack of license plates. Normally, no license plates is a correctable, non-moving violation ticket. But this guy told me he just didn't want to put them on, so I made it not correctable. That meant he'd have to put it on, and pay a bigger fine. As you can imagine, the driver was all kinds of mad at me as he drove away, while my instructor was all kinds of pleased.\n\nFast forward about 6 months later when I was off FTO and got called into the Sergeant's office.\n\n\"2BlueZebras, I just had to field a citizen's complaint against you. I guess you wrote them for littering, and made no plates not correctable?\" Crap. Yep, I remembered that incident. \"Yes sir, that sounds about right.\"\n\n\"Well, they weren't very happy, but they were willing not to make it an official complaint as long as I agreed to talk to you about it. I think this happened when you were back on training, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What did your FTO think about it?\"\n\n\"She was quite pleased.\"\n\n\"Mm...And have you done anything similar since you've been on your own?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Alright. Keep it that way. Go away.\"\n\nI've never smoked, but I do know nicotine for addicts can help calm their nerves. Being pulled over is stressful; many people hand me their information while their hands are shaking from being so nervous. With that in mind, I've never asked another person to put a cigarette out on a traffic stop. And I never worked with that Trooper side-by-side since I got off training.",

I don’t know if it’s a positive that will protect me in the future or a negative.\n\nCan you let me know your opinions on this topic as people more experienced in this.\n\n",

        "text": "A cat tail.\n\nIve been on the job for about two years now, just enough time to figure out a thing or two. Just one of those things is when you find somebody slumped over the steering wheel (strike one) of a shitty car(strike two) behind a gas station at two in the morning (strike three), things are not going well for them. \n\nAs the temperature dipped into the single digits, I pulled into the favored coffee spot in the county. As I pulled up, the advice of my old FTO rattled around in my brain. \"Don't pull right in front of the local stop and rob to go take a piss. Make sure the place isn't getting held up before you go bustling  in with your head up your ass.\"\n\nAs I debated the merits of actually sticking my head up my ass to finally feel some warmth, that's when I noticed it, a little spec of blonde hair sticking up from the driver's seat pressing against the window.\n\n\"Central, 6074 show me out at Dickie Mart on a welfare check plate is 123ABC\"\n\nAs I approached the car and activated my body worn microphone, I was debating to myself whether or not this would be an overdose, drunk,  or person who is otherwise assuming room temperature. I decided I hoped they were drunk, as we had a unit out doing DUI enforcement and I could easily pass this on to them. The closer I got, I could see that the mass of flesh was moving.....no it was convulsing. As soon as I reached out to knock on the window, the door popped open and I could hear the sound of a woman crying -no- sobbing. The kind of sob you hear at a death notification, or from the star college football player you just arrested for smoking the electric lettuce. \n\nI put on my \"I'm here to help\" voice and introduced myself \n\"Hi there, Deputy Fro-\"\n\n\"I can't believe it I HIT IT. I HIT *sob* she was just *snort* so....FUCKING PERFECT and now....*gasp*\"\n\n\"Ma'am are you ok? What did you hit? Are you-\"\n\n\"A perfect little kitty! I'm a cat LOVER!\" As she yelled a little bit of snot came out of her nose. \n\nI look back and notice the litter box and scratch post in the back seat. I gather the driver's ID and return to my  warm car to run her information. \n\n\"Central be advised driver is 10-2 (all good) but she is advising that she hit a cat on the highway.\"\n \n I return the ID to the woman who is now mostly composed enough to tell me that she hit the cat just east of where we are now on the highway. I wished the driver well, and assured her that it was probably just one of the many strays in town. I then told dispatch that I'll be checking to see if the cat is now a road hazard.\n\nI keyed up the radio \"Central show me out looking for the road hazard\" a few moments go by and I'm not seeing anything until I finally come across the lump of fur on the shoulder of the road. \"Central, 6074 I found it.\"\n\n\"6074, Central advise location of road hazard.\"\n\n\"Central, 6074 you can 10-22 (disregard) the animal is in the ditch just east of Meow Marker 200\"\n\nDispatch keys the mic followed by a long pause,\n\".........10-4 can you..... call the office?\" \n\n",

        "text": "(*Little introduction to set up the mood.*) Prisons are, by definition, rigorous environments where little is supposed to change. Days are designed to be the same, surroundings are designed to be the same, inmates are supposed to look the same. At least in theory. At least for their \"educational\" purpose, if there is ever any. So it comes as no surprise that the slightest change stands out. Inmates are very observant, in this monotonous environment. They notice a new watch, your fresh uniform, a new haircut or your polished boots.\n\nAnd now, on with our story. \n\nThis con, we'll call him Turnip, is in dry cell for allegedly packing drugs (yes, up his arse) after a private family visit. Once his girlfriend left, the drug dog sat on him so we had reasons to believe he's got something up there. But of course he won't admit to it, and still hopes to save his stuff for use or sale later. And we're not having any of it, he's supposed to give stool samples which he won't do. He also threatens to kill himself, which is usually grounds for being put under 24/7 constant surveillance by an officer. Double whammy in this particular case, his life is in danger no matter what - if he doesn't let go of the package, it may as well explode inside him resulting in a potentially fatal overdose. \n\nWatching cons on constant surveillance is not fun in the least. You get a crappy chair and sit in a hallway on a cell block, in front of a glass door, with literally nothing to do but watching inmates sleeping if you're lucky. If you're not, it can go anywhere from them pacing back and forth for hours, yelling at other inmates through the thick cell door or verbally abusing you. Sometimes it gets worse - they bite themselves, open wounds or shit in their hands and smear it all over the cell. \n\nBut this isn't the case with Turnip. He's at the pacing stage - 10 small steps to the window, pause, 10 small steps to the door, about one per second, pause, swear at me, 10 small steps to the window, pause, and the whole thing goes on again. It's been already one hour and Turnip won't surrender the pack, getting increasingly mad at me while still hoping he's getting away with his precious cargo. I'm pissed too, because I haven't had my lunch and I drew the short straw getting to watch him. So I'm prodding a bit, trying to find some grounds to reason with him.\n\n\"Okay Turnip, you know where this goes. It's not your first rodeo... Just let go of the damn package and we can all go about our business-\"\n\n\"FUCK YOU YOU PIECE OF SHIT I ain't got no package, I don't know what'chu talking about!\" 10 slow steps to the window, pause, 10 steps back. \"Lemme OUT OF THIS FUCKING CELL!\" 10 slow steps to the window, pause, 10 steps back, pause, staring at me.\n\n\"Yeah I would. But if I did, you and your little friends on the block are going to have a party with whatever's up your ass, and not before long, a slew of shiny ambulances are going to haul your overdosed carcasses to [Hospital]. Nah it ain't happening. Not on my watch. If you want to play hero, fine, let that thing go off inside you. Or take it like a man, surrender it and that's that.\"\n\n\"FUCK YOU CO!\" 10 slow steps to the window, pause, 10 steps back, pause, 10 steps to the window.\n\n\"So you're not giving it up?\"\n\nNo answer. \n\nOh hell. This is going to be a long night. Unless... Remember what I was telling you at the beginning of this story? Inmates notice changes. And I have about ten seconds, between his back and forth little walks, to change. So on my first break from the watch I get Officer Lucky aboard, and together we roll this devious scheme.\n\n10 slow steps to the window. I'm wearing sunglasses on my head. He looks at me, 10 steps to the door. Something's not right but he can't really say what. Turns around, 10 slow steps to the window. Sunglasses go away, handed to Lucky who's out of his sight, ready to help out. Another 2-3 walks back and forth, sunglasses on my head again. This time he stops by the glass door a little longer, almost getting it. But no, he doesn't. 10 slow steps to the window... sunglasses go away, and my radio too. He pauses again by the door, looking at me head to toe. On his next round, I've got my radio back. And another 2-3 walks, nothing changes. Then, I have a book in my hand, open, and I'm pretending to read from it. Another 2-3 walks, and I swap the book with a newspaper that Lucky holds ready for me. Turnip stops by the door, blinks a couple of times, but still doesn't say anything... until his next walk when I'm holding the book again. \n\n\"What the!-\" he blurts, but keeps his composure and keeps doing his little pace. I'm deadpan, not a move, not a smile. Another 2-3 walks and he starts to check over his shoulder. But nothing changes for a while, until I hold the book AND wear my sunglasses on my head again. \n\n\"Anything wrong, Turnip?\"\n\n\"Oh fuck off CO you're fucking with me.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"You know.\"\n\n\"No I don't. I have no clue what you mean, are you OK? You're talking crazy here.\"\n\n\"Fuck off.\" He starts pacing again. He doesn't want to be taken for a nut job, so he keeps his composure and tries to pretend nothing is happening. 4 laps, 5 laps... on the sixth lap, Lucky is sitting in my chair, with my book in hand and my sunglasses on his head. I'm hidden out of sight, biting my hand so I don't start laughing. \n\n\"Where's the other CO?\" I hear him going at Lucky.\n\n\"What other CO?\"\n\n\"You know. The dude that was here before.\"\n\n\"Turnip you're seeing things. It was me here all night long.\"\n\n\"Come on CO. Where's the other guy.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you there's no other guy.\" Lucky looks quite like me, same buzz cut and about the same height. A few minutes go by, then Lucky motions at me and we swap places while Turnip's not looking. \n\n\"Oh here you are again.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You came back.\"\n\n\"Turnip. I'm really worried. I never left here, what the FUCK are you going off about? Did that pack go loose inside your ass or what?\"\n\n\"There's no pack. You guys are changing.\"\n\n\"Who's changing, Turnip?\"\n\n\"You and the other officer.\"\n\n\"And I am telling you there is NO OTHER officer. Do you want me to call psychiatry? Are you alright?\"\n\n\"Fuck you.\" He starts pacing backwards from the door, but doesn't count his steps and hits the window. It hurts. He comes back to the door, not losing me from his sight. Then does the backwards walk again, hits the window and kind of stands there looking at me.\n\n\"You're being stupid. Why are you walking backwards.\"\n\n\"Because you're fucking with me.\"\n\n\"Nobody's fucking with you. I think the drugs broke in your ass. You're seeing things.\"\n\nSilence. Then, to prove me he's normal, he starts pacing back and forth again, this time turning away from me. And of course, after three walks Lucky takes my spot, book in hand and sunglasses on his head.\n\n\"Ha! You did it again!\"\n\n\"Did what?\"\n\n\"Changed. Where's the other?\"\n\n\"The other what?\"\n\n\"The other officer! There's two of you! There's two!!\"\n\n\"Dude you're nuts. We're calling psychiatry.\"\n\n\"I don't need no FUCKING PSYCHIATRY! I'M NOT NUTS!! YOU'RE FUCKING WITH ME!\"\n\n\"Nobody's fucking with you, Turnip. You're on drugs. You'd better shit that pack out before it gets worse.\"\n\nHe turns around, and Lucky beckons for the newspaper. We quickly swap the book for it.\n\n\"Hey. HEY! Where's your book?\"\n\n\"Book?\"\n\n\"You had a book in your hand. Like, right now!\"\n\n\"Turnip. I've been reading this newspaper since I got here, and all you did was - WHAT THE FUCK! HEY!\" Lucky jumps out of his chair and I join him by the door, gas in hand.\n\nTurnip is squatting in the middle of the dry cell, pants down, eyes bulged, hovering over a fresh turd with saran wrap coming out of it. I'm laughing hysterically and so does Lucky, realizing we played one on Turnip and convinced him he's overdosing. So right then and there, he dropped a deuce with the drug pack in it. I can now say that I scared an inmate shitless. Literally.\n\n",

        "text": "I was parked in my typical speed enforcement spot, running radar on a 4 lane highway, waiting for an outlier to fly by. It was a 65mph zone, and traffic was doing a pretty steady 70-75. I'm not interested in those people.\n\nThe radar I was using has a tone that changes in pitch associated with speed. Slower cars have a deeper pitch, faster cars have a higher pitch. So I was working on a report, only partially paying attention to the radar sound in the background. Every once in a while, it would scream at me and show a crazy speed, like 116mph. I'd glance up, not see anyone going that fast, and ignore it. It was getting a false read, which is why I'm there to visually confirm it's accurate. When it's a false read, it'll detect that speed for just a split second and then clear.\n\nI heard one of those radar screams, and glanced up at traffic, and noticed it was still screaming at me. My attention was drawn to a black minivan that was a blur compared to all the other cars, in the slow lane. The radar said 106mph. I looked at the minivan, and looked at the traffic around it doing 70, and it looked like a legitimate 106mph. So off I went.\n\nI finally caught up to the minivan about 2 miles later, and paced it (matched my speed to theirs) at 101mph while we were both in the fast lane. A good lawyer can argue my radar picked up somebody else. No lawyer can argue I paced somebody else. As I did this, they started moving from the fast lane to the slow lane, and took an exit. Maybe they saw me and were trying to duck out?\n\nI turned on my lights, which resulted in no response from the driver. I blipped my siren a few times. No response. We were slowing for a stop sign, and down to about 5mph. Maybe this thing was stolen. Why else are you driving a minivan that fast? I went over the PA, and directed the driver, \"Pull to the right. Stop here. Stop here.\" The driver complied.\n\nI walked up to her, and gave her a greeting with a tone as if it was something as simple as a broken taillight, and not 40+ over the posted speed limit. \"Good afternoon, ma'am. I stopped you for your speed. Is there some kind of emergency?\"\n\nShe replied, \"It's not my van, and some lights started to go on on the dash, I think maybe a fuel light. So I was just trying to get to a gas station. I didn't realize I was going that fast. I'm so sorry. Oh lord, oh Jesus.\" She's was all shaky, which is not unusual when people are stopped by the police. There was a 7 year old child in the back seat, in a car seat. A kid in the backseat at 100+mph is a little bit of a stretch for child endangerment, but not too much. And she didn't realize she was going that fast, passing people with a 30mph speed differential? I don't buy that for a second.\n\n\"Well, I need to see your driver's license.\"\n\n\"I don't have one.\" Of course not.\n\n\"How 'bout an ID?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have that.\" She goes to retrieve it.\n\n\"You said it's not your car. Whose car is it?\"\n\n\"It's my friend's car.\"\n\n\"What's your friend's name?\"\n\n\"Uhh...Da....niel. Daniel.\" Not giving me a lot of confidence that this is not a stolen car. Although few moms steal cars with their 7 year olds.\n\nShe hands me her ID. \"Ma'am, do you have the keys?\"\n\n\"Yes, this thing...\" She pulled out a fob. \"It's not a key, just a push start thing.\"\n\n\"Okay, hand me that.\" She does. No driver's license means your car is now my car. \"Wait in the car, I'll be back with you in a moment.\"\n\nI go back to my car and have dispatch run her ID for a driving history, check for warrants, and make sure the car isn't stolen. Dispatch returned the van wasn't stolen, clear on warrants, with 3 reasons for a suspended driver's license. I started a tow truck. Drivers like this really bother me as they have a complete disregard for the law, or anyone else on the road.\n\nWhile I'm doing this, she exits the car, which I specifically told her not to do, and walks back to me. Protip: don't do this. Hand on my gun. \"Yes, ma'am?\" She's on the phone as she's walking back to me.\n\n\"Sir, I just want to know what's going to happen because I need to get to church and...\"\n\n\"Okay, here's what's going to happen. You're getting a ticket for your speed and the suspended driver's license, and your car is getting impounded.\" Hand off my gun. She's not much of a threat, in demeanor or size.\n\nNow, for the next 20 minutes, I get to deal with her nervous breakdown, as she literally collapses onto the ground in tears. \"Oh lord, oh sir, please no, please no, this isn't my car, this is the only car we have. I can't get it towed. Please no, please lord, please no, you can take me to jail, please just don't take the car, my friend is going to be so mad. Please no sir.\"\n\nI reply, \"Here's the deal: the car is getting towed. You were doing over 100mph, with a suspended driver's license, which you knew was suspended, with a kid in the car. There's no way I'm not taking this car. And I could take you to jail, but even if I did that, I would still take this car.\"\n\n\"Please reconsider. If you ever reconsidered anything in your life, please reconsider this.\"\n\n\"No. My decision is final.\"\n\n\"I can't afford to get it out from the tow yard.\" That's exactly the point. Driving on a suspended license is exactly the reason we take cars. The only way to get people to stop driving is to take their vehicles.\n\nShe does a lot more begging and crying and sobbing, while I'm not sympathetic at all because of all of the aforementioned reasons. She asks, \"How am I going to get home?\"\n\n\"You can call a friend.\"\n\n\"None of my friends have cars.\"\n\n\"Your address is in Madison, right? I'll give you and your son a ride.\" She runs out of arguments against this.\n\nThe car was impounded, and we're one big happy family in my patrol car, driving to her aunt's residence. When we got there, the last thing she said to me was, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It's been a great couple years and the positivity I've gotten from this sub has been amazing, life changing even. I'll miss the catharsis that comes from typing out a tough call or reliving a funny event when the job is taking a bleak turn. Unfortunately I've seen a vision of the negativity getting caught posting about my experiences could wreak on my life and it far outweighs the positives. I've got to make sure I'm able to provide for my family foremost and when my only real-world skills involve driving fast and not being sickened by homosexual hobo sex, I just might not be as marketable outside of the law enforcement community as I would hope. \n\nI'll be deleting my history tomorrow or Thursday, as time permits, so get your cramming in if you want to read anything while it's still up. The account may be alive after but I won't be posting comments or contents from it outside of protected sub reddits. I will still have PM I guess, it just might take a little longer to respond. \n\nAs for a book, I have everything I've ever written saved and have about a dozen other stories that I've been holding on to for opsec purposes. I hope one day I'll be able to get them out somehow. Also, /u/forensicunit really wants to get a TFTSC book out as well. I'll happily add to that if he would have me. \n\nSo long folks! It's been a fun ride!\n\n**EDIT** Here's a potential answer to one of the more frequent questions: If I or TFTSC get to the point where a book is incoming, I'll create a throwaway and come back here to promote it, cool?\n\n",

        "text": "It was a beautiful summer day and, like any day in California where there isn't rain (who am I kidding?), people were out in numbers in the Bay area. A couple of buddies and I had planned the day, packed lunches and rented a nicely dilapidated [catamaran sailboat](http://i.imgur.com/oM3eZ2A.jpg)(sans girls and added on about 20 years of wear and tear). \n\n3 out of the 4 of us hadn't sailed before, and were all going on the notion that our fourth buddy knew the best way of keeping us afloat - and away from the 50 other watercraft flying around. We saw the usual sailboats, paddleboarders, and kayakers and had a good bit of fun for awhile. That is, until lunchtime.\n\nWe pull the boat in, break open the food and start eating. There were more people on the water now and we were happy to take a break from it all. We didn't stay on shore long and quickly got back out to wreak more havoc on the poor people trying to enjoy their day. Apart from arguing how high the jib should be set, how to properly pronounce \"mainsail\" and narrowly avoiding a collision with an old man in a canoe, we almost missed the empty kayak.\n\nIt was red. The life jacket was purple and, like any good life jacket, it bobbed up and down next to the vacant kayak. And we laughed and joked. \"Wooooooops\" I heard my buddy up front say as the clatter of one of the lonely paddles clattered against the hull of our boat. We weren't 10 feet from the kayak and the air was still. It was remarkably eerie and I remember noting so. It wasn't unheard of and not particularly unusual. We had seen paddleboarders fall over and even catamarans - like the one we were on - capsize in a glorious fashion. But we should've reacted. We should've jumped in to see if everything was okay. And I will always regret that we didn't.\n\nWe heard the chopper long before we saw it. It was red too, and, came in slow, to finally rest in a stable hover over the bay. The white lettering of \"U.S COAST GUARD\" was easily read on the side. It sat reasonably high above us, however we were still able to feel the wind of it's rotors slam into the water, creating wake that added a very chaotic feeling to the otherwise beautiful day. Next came sirens as a black and white boat, with a fluctuating blue light atop it, came quickly cruising into the area. I hadn't noticed it before, but the bay was nearly empty. People had quickly shuffled out and we either hadn't realized due to the helicopter, or we were just having too much fun to see.  Whether it is my memory playing tricks on me or not, I do not know, but I can't help but remember the sky going gray as a cloud cover quickly appeared. The police boat came nearer and nearer before finally sailing by us, still going at a quick rate.\n\n\"GET TO SHORE, TURN IT AROUND!\" the officer shouted as loud as he could, to be heard over the rotors and boat motors. The boat quickly shot past us as it continued to intercept the other unsuspecting boaters. We quickly got back to shore and were met by two officers by the rental stand of the dock. They got some quick info from us on what we had seen and were quite vague as to what was going on. As funny as it sounds to anyone else, we still didn't know why this was happening. A shark attack? Chemicals in the water? What? The officers wouldn't say, and it's not until I got home that I found out.\n\nA teenager - not knowing how to swim and without a lifejacket on, had capsized in his kayak and his body retrieved from the water after rescue divers spent hours looking for him.  We had, presumably, sailed right past him - maybe even right over him. I can't feel too guilty as I am sure he was already gone by the time we happened upon his kayak, but it's still a terrible feeling. Such a young kid and had no-one there to help him when he needed it.  \n\nI hope, whether in life or once I join the ranks of law enforcement, I can help someone who really, truly needs it. And I commend all of you who do it every day.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I, a federal officer, was part of a joint task force working the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) in a southern state. For those who don't know, the ICW runs from Boston to Florida, then over to...Texas or something. It's a thin \"river\" for pleasure craft to transit long distances without going offshore and dealing with heavy seas, open water, etc. It runs through remote areas and at night is rarely trafficked except by fishing boats and bad guys.\nSo I'm onboard a State Wildlife boat, the officer has his section of the ICW memorized, we were running it at 50 knots, in the dark, without a spotlight, just using the moon, cool stuff.\n\nWe see a vessel in the reeds doing some fishing, so we stop to check him out, make sure he's not moving meth (popular in the area).\nGuy gave off a very \"stoner hippie\" vibe: white guy dreadlocks, obviously a heavy marijuana user, real friendly, but kinda slow.\nI go to work checking his gear, permits, safety equipment, while the Wildlife guy chats him up.\nMy job was done quickly: because he was using illegal gear, had no permits, and no safety equipment. He was basically scooping up every fish and keeping it, a huge problem that depletes all of the fish in that area.\nSo I have to write him up for safety violations, no permits, illegal gear, etc.  Each one was a $1000 fine minimum. Because he had no safety equipment (life jacket, strobe light, fire extinguisher) I had to order him back to port. Which was a dock about 50 feet away.\nHe was just like \"awww mannnn, I'm so sorry...I'll get this fixed up so I'm not breakin any laws, sir.\" Like I said, polite to a T. Which I had never experienced, especially after handing out that many fines.\n\nWe make sure he goes home, then depart. The Wildlife guy then tells me: \"that guy is infamous around here. nice dude, always gets violated, comes back out. His grandfather did the same thing, once, about 30 years ago. Except that when a solo officer was onboard his boat attempting to give him his fines, grandpa attacked the officer, and pushed him overboard then started beating him in the head with an oar to drown him. The officer shot grandpa dead, from the water. Thankfully grandson isn't like grandpa!\"\n\nMe: \"I'm glad you didn't tell me that until after the boarding.\"",

        "text": "I was working weekend graveyards, which is when the madness happens. Multiple, simultaneous pursuits were not unheard of. Officer involved shootings one night to the next  happened. We were always on alert.\n\nWe were working a special detail in city streets. The governor gave us a directive to combat crime in the city because the local police were getting overrun, so we were out in force. And the locals appreciated it, as we began to outnumber them.\n\nA nearby unit went out on a stop, and Johnson and I were partnered up and en route to provide backup. I went to make a u-turn at a red light when I watched an old Honda blow through the intersection, through the light, going the other way. I flipped on my lights to pull in behind the Honda. By the time I made my turn, the Honda was three blocks ahead, and had just blown two more lights. My car's dash cam was able to catch most of it. I alerted the guys on the stop ahead, \"Heads up, you've got a high speed vehicle headed your way.\" They got out of the road just in time as he blasted by them. \n\nI went full lights and sirens to catch up, and found myself doing 90 in a 35 zone. That's a risk to public safety on my end, which my Sargeant wouldn't approve of, so I slowed it down. The Honda saw me and started to yield.\n\nWhen I finally caught up, two other Troopers were in position, and we detained the driver. The driver claimed he was upset about an argument he got into with his girlfriend. He saw the other Troopers on the traffic stop, and figured he'd get pulled over for his driving as soon as he went by.\n\nI took him to jail for reckless driving; 90+ on city streets plus 2 blown red lights and nearly running over two other Troopers is a pretty solid example of reckless driving. \n\nI checked the case a couple weeks later to see if he plead out, or if I'd be going to court. With 4 other Troopers and my dashcam, it seemed like a slam dunk.\n\nAll charges dropped by the DA. They had more important things to worry about. I did my job. Not much I can do if someone else doesn't do theirs.\n\nThe lesson I learned from that was to write him a ticket for speed, one red light, and another red light. At least then he'd face some sort of consequence.",

        "text": "My husband and I both come from middle class families and everyone on both sides are very straight-laced (we met at church, no one was into drugs or alcohol, etc.) My husband's dad is retired now, but when we first got married he held a fairly high position at a hospital. When he wasn't at work he was the Deacon at our church, always involved in leading Bible studies and so-forth. We'll say his dad's name is John.  \n  \nWe married young so in our early years of marriage we were living in the not-so-great part of town. One day my husband was at school and my class hadn't started yet. As I was leisurely getting ready I hear a pounding at the door. Looking out, I see two police officers. I crack the door:  \n  \n&gt; Can I help you? Is something wrong?  \n  \n\"Yes,\" they say. \"We're looking for John. Is he here?\"  \n  \nMy first thought was, well why the heck would they be looking for my father-in-law at my house...? I'm thinking he's hurt or missing or something, so I ask no more questions and immediately respond:  \n  \n&gt; No, he should be at work! Is he okay?  \n  \n\"Well,\" the officers respond, \"he's wanted right now. Where does he work?\"  \n  \nI'm panicking. What would my father-in-law be wanted for?! Some kind of... financial embezzlement?! After all, my in-laws just took a nice vacation...  \n  \nI tell the officers where he works and immediately start trying to call him, but he's not answering. Not much later, the officers are back.  \n  \n\"We were just at XYZ Hospital and they say John doesn't work there. Can we come in and take a look around?\"  \n  \nWHAT. THE. HECK. Are these guys even real? Here I am, a month past my 19th birthday in a seedy part of town... So I asked the officers to give me a moment so I could call dispatch and I shut the door. At this point, I imagine they thought I was trying to hide my father-in-law.  \n  \nAfter confirming that the officers were legitimate I let them in. They looked around, under beds, in closets, etc. Finally I asked them what my father-in-law was wanted for, but they wouldn't tell me. Now I'm thinking it's REALLY bad. They asked me again why my father-in-law works. I told them, the same as before, XYZ hospital. There's some back and forth, me saying  \n  \n&gt; Talk to Matt, the security guard! I was JUST there last week!  \n  \nFinally, one of the officers says, \"We DID speak to Matt, and he says John Doe doesn't work there!\"  \n  \nWait. John. Doe? My father-in-law's last name is Smith...  \n  \nI showed the officer's my marriage certificate to confirm the last name, and they said they had some additional checking to do. I never heard back from them, so I assume they realized my father-in-law was innocent. But, for half a day at least, my super straight-laced, church-attending father-in-law was a fugitive from the law.",

I'll probably post others as I remember them.*\n\nOver the course of my career in private security and now public safety, I've witnessed countless fiery zingers from cops, usually directed at some hapless suspect or snooty civilian.  I like to call them \"stutter-inducers\" because that's what they usually do, and the results are always awesomely entertaining.\n\nThis is one of my all-time favorites:\n\nWhile working private security at a residential complex, my partner and I conducted an arrest on some punk (I can't recall for what). \n\nOur guy was a young black male, clad in XXL clothing and plenty of jewelry, dwarfed only by his ego.  We led him, handcuffed, back to our holding area and called the police to come collect him.\n\nThe cop that arrived, Officer Morris, was a seasoned vet that helped us out on a regular basis.  I loved that guy.  He was completely no-nonsense and part of the reason I was inspired to pursue a career in law enforcement.\n\nEven though Officer Morris wasn't particularly tall or physically imposing, the way he conducted himself always impressed me.  Think of the most terrifying and intimidating leprechaun you can.  That was Officer Morris, and I mean no insult by that.  It's as accurate as I can put it (and yep, he was Irish).\n\nAt some point during the interaction, the suspect blurted out something along the lines of \"You bitch-ass racist police just mad cuz you can't pimp hoes like I can.\"\n\nOfficer Morris got right up in the punk's face and growled \"Boy, do you know what a *pimp* ***is***?\"\n\nThe punk suddenly sat up straighter and his face went blank.  A weak murmur came out, then silence.\n\nOfficer Morris leaned in closer. \"A *pimp* is a ***slave-holder***.\"  He clamped a hand on the suspect's shoulder and squeezed.\n\n\"Are you a *slave-holder*, ***boy***?\"\n\nHe got no response.  My co-workers and I couldn't stop laughing for the rest of the night.\n\nWe never saw the \"pimp\" around after that.",

        "text": "Two other Troopers and I were at the scene of a crash where a car went a couple hundred feet off a cliff. The driver had already been extricated, so we were waiting for the tow truck to pull the car out. Another call came out of a two vehicle crash westbound on I-4 at Main Street (the location matters). Two of us cleared to handle the new crash, while the last Trooper waited for the tow truck.\n\nWhile we were en route, we had reports that a driver in a Mercedes in the crash fled on foot. We got a good description. I continued to the crash scene, while my partner (Jones) continued to look for the driver. I showed up to a mess. Two cars blocking the Main Street exit, which happened to be the only freeway entrance to the local town, and three cars situated so they were blocking every lane on a four lane freeway. A firetruck pulled up behind me. I checked on everyone at the scene, and no one was injured. Two of the cars were drive-able, so their owners drove them off to the exit, while I used my patrol car to ram the last car out of the way. Freeway was open, but the exit was blocked...and it was going to have to stay that way. \n\nJones reached me over the radio, and let me know he didn't find the guy who ran away. However, I was out with five cars. The crash we were headed to had two cars. And we were getting more reports of it, and the vehicles didn't match what I was out with. Jones headed to westbound I-44 at Main Street and found another crash. You read that right; I was westbound I-4 at Main Street with a crash, while Jones was westbound I-44 at Main Street. Pretty easy to mix up. Another Trooper headed to back up Jones, not realizing that there were two separate crashes since our dispatched got confused and merged them all together. And one of the drivers in Jones's crash was drunk.\n\nThe firefighters came up to me, \"We can block the exit as long as you need us to.\" Considering they were my only backup, I gladly accepted their offer. A couple minutes later, Madison PD contacted my dispatch. They caught the driver who ran away on foot, and wanted the Troopers to respond. No problem, made sense, but they were going to have to wait while I worked on the five crashed cars in front of me.\n\nI spoke to a bunch of the drivers, and one pointed out that there was a passenger in the Mercedes who claimed to be the driver, and she definitely was not driving. And this I knew because Madison PD had the driver in custody. The passenger and I had a conversation about the lies she was telling me, and the warrant she had out of another state. Unfortunately, no extradition.\n\nAn hour later, Madison PD rolled up to the crash scene, with just me and the firefighters.\n\n\"Hey, we caught a guy down on the city streets that our Sergeant is out with. Are you able to send someone down?\"\n\nI let them know, \"Yeah, my dispatch told me. But...\" I did the Vannah White Wheel of Fortune move to all the cars, \"This is what I'm dealing with, and it's just me. It'll be a minute.\"\n\nI was listening over the radio as Jones arrested one of the drivers in his crash, and he headed off to the jail. The Trooper who backed him up finally headed to my scene, which was almost wrapped up. I left the other Trooper at the crash site to finish getting vehicles towed away, while I went to visit the suspect. I finally told the firefighters they could clear out, and I appreciated their help. The suspect freely admitted he was driving, he had warrants, and ran because he didn't want to get in trouble for driving without a driver's license. As was expected, he caused it all by driving like an idiot.\n\nFinal tally was drunk driver went to jail, hit and run driver went to jail, and the passenger was eventually issued a warrant for knowingly providing false information during a police investigation. While it was an overall mess, it was made a little bit better by the firefighters and local PD who helped.\n",

I was walking near a grassy patch when I saw something metallic in the grass, so I went to have a peek.\n\nLaying in the grass was a giant knife. The kind of combat style knife you see in the movies. I thought for sure it was fake, so I bumped it with my shoe. Nope, real. The weight of the metal blade was proof enough of that.\n\nThe blade was dirty, and it had clearly been discarded here on purpose. I thought to myself, \"Shit, did I just find a murder weapon?\" So I did the only reasonable thing and called the police, who informed me that a car would be out to me soon, and if I could stay with the knife until officers arrive.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of waiting a squad car rolls up, and two very tired looking officers are chugging coffee before hopping out and strolling over to me. We greet each other and I show them the knife. It looks like it could be evidence or something, so obviously they want to secure it, so one of our sleepy officers goes and get an evidence bag and comes back over. She puts on some gloves, and grabs the knife by the end of the handle, pinched between her thumb and finger.\n\nHolding the bag in her other hand, she drops the blade into it, point down. Evidence bags are plastic, so of course the knife sails right through the bottom of the bag and down towards our feet, causing us both to jump back.\n\nThe officer stood in silence for a moment, her hand still suspended in the air, and blinked slowly at the knife, then to me. \"Right... Knives are sharp...\" she muttered.\n\nHer partner has the biggest grin on his face as he pats her on the back. \"Knives *are* sharp, eh?\"\n\nWe all had a good laugh.",

        "text": "This is my magnum opus, the story that gets retold whenever someone asks for a crazy story about my former job. I feel it's a story better heard than read but I promise it's 100% true. \n\nIn what now feels like a former life I was a parole officer for my states Department of Corrections. As a new parole officer you inherent the caseload of the agent you replaced, which includes those who abscond and have a warrant for their arrest. This tale is about one such parolee who had absconded ~5 years prior to my start. The parolee was arrested over the weekend 4 1/2 hours north of my office in the middle of nowhere. Normally this isn't an issue, we just have an officer in that area go and serve paperwork and get the process rolling. Monday morning rolls around and I am greeted with a slew of messages on my work phone and a phone call coming in at 8:02 which I promptly let go to voicemail. The messages and phone call was from the parolees husband who insisted there was some mistake and wanted answers as to why his wife had been arrested as she clearly wasn't the man who had a warrant for parole absconding. Oh wonderful, he doesn't know his wife is Male to Female. In prison at the time my state did not pay for surgery or hormone therapy but the parolee was doing the best she(as I will now refer to her) could to appear female by growing out her hair, tattooing makeup etc. Sometime after her release she must have completed her transformation into a women and started living under an assumed name. During a traffic stop she gave an assumed name which obviously didn't check out and she was arrested and taken to jail, and once there admitted to jail staff her real identity. So I call him back and initially tell the husband that I'm looking into what's going on and we will get this all figured out. Now some of you might have bullshit alarms going off right now about how the husband couldn't figure out the obvious and trust me mine were going off even more. Now I'm not trying to judge a book by its cover but a quick look at the husband's DMV picture made everyone in my office (as this obviously the most entertaining shit in the office if your not steering the shitshow) understand that the guy is only running on half a tank. So I call the jail, who is also instructing the husband to contact me for updates since they don't want to touch this with a 10' pole since she is only there on my warrant, and speak to the parolee. I tell her that she needs to come clean with her husband and tell him what's really going on and she needs to tell him the truth. She agrees, and I leave it at that. Now the process to figure out what to do with a parolee who has absconded at the time could take days, and was further complicated by the parolees health conditions. \nTuesday and Wednesday come and I'm still getting 10 calls a day from the husband who is stating that his wife is insistent that she is not a man and damnit he should know. You have got to be fucking shitting me. He has now come to the conclusion that fingerprinting can get this all cleared up. We don't order fingerprints for parolees, especially for ones who have admitted their identity. A few more phone calls to the parolee to reiterate that: 1) it's not my job to tell your husband you used to be a man, 2) he should hear it from you, and 3) it's not my fucking job. \n\nOn Thursday I'm sick of this shit and ask the jail to take the prints. I don't care if they throw them right into the trash without running them, but take them so I can be done with this. I obviously wait for the husband to call as I have zero desire to do this as the guy seems like a genuinely nice enough guy just a little slow. I tell him as gently as I can that we did the finger prints and that his wife is a wanted male parolee. Now I've given hard news before from death notices of family, extremely long prison sentences, and that there probably won't be a HL3 and this one was the worst. In that silence you could hear him breaking as a man. It was absolutely heart breaking. After a very long silence he asked what he should do and if his marriage was even valid. I told him that civil law wasn't my area of expertise but if she used a false name it may be void. He hung up and that was the last I ever heard from him. \nAs for the parolee, considering her health conditions were terminal, she hadn't re-offended in the 5 years, and she served her minimum when she was released they discharged her parole. I have no idea what happened to them and their relationship. Being this was 8 years ago she has likely passed, and I can't for the life of me remember her name (real or assumed) to look up the obit.

        "text": "This tale comes from several years ago, where I was assigned to a multinational task force in an east-Asian country.  Included in this team was a communications support element to handle the system links and encryption needs.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nA new (junior) technician is assigned to the support role to replace a member that had rotated out.  This technician will be known as Young Thug, or $YT. YT's behavior was similar to some other new hires we had been seeing in the past few years: that of indignity and disrespect towards senior members; malaise of workplace motivation; and a general attitude of being owed everything for merely being present.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nUnfortunately for us, to have a team member removed or replaced was rather difficult. Months of documentation and efforts to correct undesirable behavior are required in order to be rid of a bad egg, so YT was shunted to a minimal-impact role in order to facilitate the mission.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nOur break comes several months into dealing with YT: Young Thug pops positive for THC. Due to our location, testing was done quarterly to all personnel on site at that time by a facilitator that would come and visit us. Like Christmas with a bow, the director orders YT to be gone. This is alternate to the locals prosecuting him for possession of an illicit substance, which means a wonderful time in their prison.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI am assigned to escort YT see the administrative staff at the nearby site for finishing paperwork, then place him on a bus to the airport.  After the bus leaves, he is not my problem.  The paperwork portion goes off without a fuss, and I manage to get him to the bus.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nAs he boards, I get a call on my cell from another tech: YT had stolen their smartphone and blocked their number!  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThis is not a place I want to be.  On the one hand, he is about to leave the country. On the other hand, I may have to arrest him for grand theft and delay removing him from being our problem.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nBoarding the bus, I confront him about the phone:  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n&gt; $me: Do you have $coworker's phone?  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n&gt; $YT: yeah, they let me borrow it to talk to my girlfriend  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n&gt; $me: Bullshit, I just spoke to them. I need you to hand over the phone.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n&gt; $YT: Naw, I need it to talk to my girl before I leave the country.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n&gt; $me: Either you hand over the phone, or I remove you from this bus and you go to jail.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThe bus, which was completely full, was silent.  After what seemed an eternity of him shooting daggers at me, he hands over the phone and I step off the bus. The driver closes the doors, the bus rolls out of our compound, and YT is no longer my problem.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nIf all you want to do is smoke weed and act hood, don't sign up for a job where you are around Feds all day.",
