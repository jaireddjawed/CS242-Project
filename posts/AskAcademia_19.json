Anyone have a sense of what this means? Do like half the applications get beyond the first round or only a select few, which means my chances are pretty good at getting it? \n\nI know it doesn’t really matter—I’ll find out eventually, but of course I’m trying to understand what happens in the black box while I go crazy waiting. At least they updated us—so sick of literally never hearing back from other fellowships even though the deadline was October 1 (and not big ones like NEH but smaller institutes or museums where I know decisions have been made because it’s a small world). \n\nAnyway—thanks for any insights you might have about the Fulbright process.",

I found that I really enjoyed the research process, even as frustrating as it’s been. I questioned whether a PhD might be a better fit for me, however I am scared to jump ship and change career plans completely. This year I could retake the mcat and try again, get letters of rec updated, etc. or I could plan to apply to a PhD program in my field. I’m currently still doing research with my PI and I still enjoy it, but would I enjoy this as a career? I feel like I like it because I’m not even sure if it’s a permanent job for me yet. Idk I figured I would post and hopefully get insight from people. The job security as a scientist kind of freaks me out a bit, and seems much different than the job security as an attending physician. Im a very risk averse person, and the idea of med school always appealed to me because of its linear path. Past tests/jump through a few hoops -&gt; MD/DO. With a phd it seems there is a lot less certainty. Any insight helps regardless.",

The first semester was amazing, I got all A's, worked well with my advisor/mentor/chair, and have a solid (but still draft) idea for my dissertation.  However, recently my partner's cancer returned again for the third time... The doctor seems optimistic and has many treatment plans but it will require radiation, possibly intense chemo, or entering a trial. I live two hours away from him and am as poor as any other Ph.D. student. I am considering withdrawing to be able to assist him with his treatment and get a job where I can actually financially assist with things. Being a strong and wide spreading cancer I am very scared as the doctor said this will probably be a reoccurring thing. My heart tells me to return to live with him and focus on what really matters to me. I'm not unhappy with my Ph.D. experience but I have yet to be a practicing planner, and actually make a living wage, and do want to later regret not spending time with him.  Being a professor / having a PhD was never the final big dream but a path I've always been interested in. I am also the first in my family to go to university and be born in the US. (M/27/Gay)",

I accepted a TT position at an R1 institution in spring 2022 but negotiated to start in fall 2023 since I was in the middle of wrapping up postdoc projects &amp; animal studies. I recently found out that I’m pregnant and my due date is early August 2023..my start date for the TT position is July 2023. I won’t have any paid leave if I start in July since that requires at least 12 months of employment with the university. I’m also not sure about unpaid leave or sick leave.. I want to let the department chair know as soon as I get through the 1st trimester but I’m not sure if I should request an additional delay in my start date to Jan ‘24 (which means they would’ve waited ~1.5 yrs for me to start); or if I should request first-semester teaching relief and start in July, then go on maternity leave a month later. Would I qualify for an extension on my tenure clock? I’m so unsure about how to approach this and will really, really appreciate any feedback! \n#momademia #academicmoms #tenuretrack #maternityleave #academia",

Now, with that as a starting point. Within this position things have been going quite well and I have luckily been involved in things above and beyond the regular 'workload' of a PhD candidate, e.g. My supervisor and I do a project involving big names in our field from Stanford and Harvard and I've personally had numerous (national) media report on my work, always with of course our faculty's name attached. \n\nWhile I enjoy my job a lot, obviously none of us work just for fun. So I'm contemplating discussing with my direct supervisor or HR to ask for an increase in salary that fits with the work I am doing that benefits both the law faculty and me.\n\nMy main worry is that they will say: 'Yes you've been doing many things but that is part of any PhD candidacy and does not warrant extra salary.'. However, in that case, no PhD could ever get a salary increase, and that seems ridiculous. So how do you look at this matter?",

        "text": "Apologies for the long post, but there’s a lot I want to get off my chest.\n\nI’m a third year PhD student in applied mathematics at an R1 university.\n\nSince I successfully defended my master’s thesis recently, my PhD advisor asked me whether I wanted to continue to finish the PhD. I said yes, and he asked me what I wanted to do after the PhD. \n\nFor context, in my field it’s more common to go into industry than academia. For me personally, when I’m teaching mathematics I feel like I’m doing what I was meant to do. Nothing has ever made me feel more fulfilled than teaching. Because of this, it’s hard to see myself staying in industry long-term. I would rather pursue a fulfilling teaching career, even if I get paid less.\n\nSo I definitely want to stay in academia, but with teaching as my primary focus rather than research. Of course, the last thing I would want my PhD advisor to know is that I prefer teaching to research. I could see myself doing some research, but I would rather not be under constant pressure to publish, or to write grants. The kind of research I do doesn’t really require funding or equipment of any kind, so I would be pretty content to do that as long as I can do it on my own time. Besides, teaching is, in many aspects, far more stable than research. I also find teaching more fulfilling, as I mentioned before. All these factors make a full-time lecturer job seem vastly preferable to me compared to a tenure-track professorship.\n\nWhen my advisor asked me what I wanted to do after my PhD, I told him I was leaning towards academia but had some doubts about tenure track. After all, getting tenure is an extremely competitive and grueling process, probably more so than a PhD, and I’m already at my limit as is. \n\nWhen I told him my doubts, he responded, “well besides tenure track, what else is there?” I replied, “I could be a lecturer or an adjunct” and he suddenly got a murderous look on his face that immediately made my stomach sink. He blurted out, “are you crazy?” and I said “excuse me for not wanting to sacrifice my work-life balance for 7 more years.” He then gave me a mouthful about how non-tenure track people have way less job security, they get paid less, and they have no upward mobility or prestige. I was pretty shaken up by his instant change in attitude and had to step away from the conversation.\n\nDuring the conversation, I did let it slip that I care more about teaching than research. He at least seemed to respect my opinion on it rather than press me, which was a relief for me.\n\nI wish I had known going into this PhD that teaching tends to be second banana to research. Still, I see no point in wasting the progress I’ve made towards my PhD. My goal is still to teach mathematics at an undergraduate/graduate level, and a PhD is the best way to attain that goal. Still, I find myself constantly being thrust into these situations where I’m expected to act like research is my favorite thing in the whole wide world. It makes me extremely frustrated.\n\nI guess my question is, what are your thoughts on the conversation I had with my advisor? Would I really be committing academic suicide by going for a lecturer job that doesn’t require me to do research? What are your experiences with tenure/non-tenure? And what do you think I should do?\n\nPersonally, I can’t help but feel like my advisor is extremely biased, or perhaps out of touch. He’s pretty old (maybe like lower 70s?), and my understanding is that academia is very different now than it was a few decades ago, particularly in terms of the job market. Still, he’s basically top dog in my department, so his opinion carries a lot of weight, and I find it difficult to just write it off as him being a boomer. I have very mixed feelings and could really use some clarity about this.",

The lab consensus seems to be that that project has a major chance of being ready by the deadline. There's a small chance I would be able to get my own project done by the same deadline for the same journal, but the risk for my project is much higher. I would get co-authorship on the other project.  \n\n\nI don't want to join a project on the last month before publication, that sounds like Brook's law, it would take me 2 weeks to get up to speed to then only have 2 weeks to actually do anything useful...  \n\n\nI am drowning in stress just to think about it. I  want to tell my supervisor \"It's too late for me to join the other project, let me work independently and see if I get lucky with  my project, we know exactly the last thing that needs to be fixed I think I might be able to get it done\".  \n\n\nThis is what I would like to do, but I am terrified, because if I don't get to the deadline I am now responsible for two missed projects instead of 1. At the same time, the idea of helping with the other project at this stage is as appealing as eating burning coal, especially with how close my own project is.  \n\n\nAm I being a bad grad student if I tell my supervisor I just want to try to finish my own project?",

Additionally, IME many AI-generated pieces are fairly stilted in their language use.\n\nBut some day that won't be the case. In fact, some day it may be possible that AI can essentially create an otherwise legitimate, well-done paper (as in, pull real sources together and create a novel document from them) with little student input.\n\nHow do you think higher ed will adapt? (I'm thinking mostly about teaching/testing students, but if you want to talk about research and scientific writing, feel free!) \n\nI feel like if we can somehow get away from this \"college is to get a job\" so that many/most students don't actually care about the learning but are just there to check a box we might be able to just generally reduce the impetus to cheat in general, but that will require some significant societal change.\n\nI was thinking that in many fields that might ask you to write a paper (as opposed to sit an exam during class time where you couldn't access an AI bot) we may benefit from giving up the \"arms race\" and returning to a model of oral examinations. Each student meets with the instructor (small classes) or 1-2 TAs in a team of several (larger classes) and basically take an oral examination. Examinations can be recorded for review if there are complains/questions afterward. \n\nBut then I thought about how many students these days have anxiety-related or similar concerns if not full out accommodations and how much that would probably increase if students knew they'd regularly have to do oral examinations. Additionally, it may be hard to have every student receive fair, equal-difficulty tests without giving them the same questions to answer, yet if you give them all the same questions it would be difficult to prevent early test takers from telling others what they will be asked.\n\nSo I am curious, what do y'all see as the way forward in a world of AI bots doing homework?",

To finish this class you have to work through a cobbled together patchwork of websites to finish your homework, ask questions, and read the book.  \n\nTo give you an example, here is how I need to finish my homework assignment:\n\n1. Log into school class website\n2. Register for the class book which you cannot buy, but only access for 6 months for $63\n3. Register for the \"learning center\" to be able to submit homework.  You don't register for the learning center on the learning center website.  You must go to a different website to register the learning center.  It is 14 steps, and there are numerous errors on the webpage.  If this were a business, their website would be considered borderline unusable.\n4. Connect this \"learning center\" website to your school class website.  \n5. Watch lectures on school website\n6. Do homework on book publisher website.   \n7. Go to learning center website during specific 2 hours slots available per day to submit homework with an available instructor.\n8. Email a screenshot to the class professor, of your submitted homework on the learning center.  This is how the class professor knows you did the homework.  I am assuming because she doesn't have access to who has submitted homework at the learning center?\n\nHas this method been proven to help students learn?  Why are we making students jump through so many hoops just to do homework?  To me, this is absolutely maddening.  \n\nWhen I was a community college student in 1998 I barely had my head above water and I was an extremely stressed out kid.  If I was looking at this crazy system of 4 different and un-connected websites just to take a class I would probably just given up.  Community college was my ticket out, and it literally saved my life.  I want young adults to have success in CC and have good productive careers in the workforce.  I don't see this new learning paradigm as helping more students become successful. \n\nFor the 18 year old kid, going to college for the first time, are we as a society doing a disservice to this kid?  \n\nSorry for the long rant, I just really do care about education and I'm heartbroken to see what it has become.",

I am enrolled in a post grad fellowship where I am receiving my masters for free while teaching at a Catholic School. \n\nI’ve always had a very strong interest in theology and took as many theology courses as I could in undergrad. However, I never studied it full time because I was scared of not finding a job after college. I studied history and education with the goal of becoming a teacher post grad. However after discussing doctoral studies with my advisors for my M.Ed  and teaching scripture at school and I realized that I want to pursue a Ph.D in theology. Obviously, I am not working towards my M.Div right now, and I can’t change my course of study due to the contract I signed when I joined my fellowship. \n\nMy program is offering a certificate in religious education but I’m not sure if that’s enough to meet the prerequisite for doctoral studies. \n\nWhat are the next steps I should take?\n\nThanks!",

At the start of my 2nd year, I applied for a research position at random and got it; I am still in this position. At the time I applied, I was majoring in social work (I switched spring semester), so I went for a social work research position. Now, I plan to get my degree in psych with the goal of eventually getting a PhD or PsyD. The person I work with was fine with keeping me on after my major change, but I don't know if I would be better off when it comes time to apply to grad school if I tried to find a psych position.\n\nI guess it wouldn't hurt, right? But honestly I feel like I got so lucky with my current job that I would be crazy to switch.\n\n\\- The person I work for would like to keep me on till I graduate, so my job is pretty secure\n\n\\- I set my own hours and there isn't too much rush (this year at least)\n\n\\- The job is all writing papers and moving data, which I've gotten pretty good at and can be kind of fun (the writing, anyway). I have a friend who is a psych research assistant and his job is killing rats, which I don't envy\n\n\\- Last year I wrote two papers for two studies the person I work for conducted. They're in the publication process still, but assuming they do get published, I am second author on both of them. I do not know how I pulled this off. If everything goes as planned, I will also be second author on our current study\n\n\\- Social work is pretty close to psych, and I'm still interested in the work we're doing\n\n\\- Okay and here's the real reason I'd be crazy to switch... I make $20 an hour. I also do not know how I pulled that off, minimum wage here is $10\n\nSo I feel like I would be lucky to get a new position in the first place, but like insanely lucky to get any job as good as this. I thought about trying to take on a second part time position, but I don't think that's really feasible time wise. Do you think that grad schools will be bothered by the fact that my work is in social work, or do you think that they will just see it as research experience? Is any resume-boost I would get from having a job more related to my career goals worth taking on a job that will likely be worse than my current one?",

We have access to a supplemental funding opportunity called the [NSF IPERF Program](https://iperf.asee.org/), the Innovative Postdoctoral Entrepreneurial Research Fellowship, where the National Science Foundation will pay salary + benefits to a postdoc to work with a startup, and the startup can add salary stipends as well (&gt; $100k salary total + benefits).\n\nI am trying to hire a postdoc to come join my startup, but have been having a really hard time. I think the opportunity is amazing and the pay is significantly better than typical postdoc stipends from what I can tell. I have been searching for \\~3 months now with no good leads - I have job posts on linkedin, indeed, wellfound, and I have reached out to many universities directly with little to no response\n\nCould you give me some insight from your perspectives? Where do you go job hunting when you're interested in a job, leaving your postdoc position? Is there some website I don't know where I should be posting my job description? Do people come directly to university and spread the word about positions that way? I am looking specifically for a postdoc with experience in hardware; primary mastery in electronics, experience in mech e, some data analytics knowledge is a huge plus as well.\n\nPlease give me some pointers or advice as to how i can best find this person",

My primary and secondary supervisors (it's a DTP, hence the multiple supervisors) are not as big in terms of reputation, but very supportive and knowledgeable, and still recognized and very well appreciated for their work. \n\nThis PhD was my second best option - I could not join a top 5 of the world university after receiving a conditional offer due to insufficient funding. I notice the thought/realization still haunts me, even though I'm generally very happy with these first few months of my PhD and there haven't been any red flags thus far. My third supervisor, the big name, is not going to be very invested in me - she is incredibly busy. But her name will likely be on my papers, which I see as an advantage. \n\nAny thoughts? What do you think matters more or how have either a university's prestige or your link to a very big name in your field impacted your career, motivation, prospects, happiness, etc.?\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

To complicate things further, programme B costs *much* less than the programme at my dream school, and it *is* offered by a very prestigious school. I feel very torn trying to decide on what I should do. I'd really appreciate it if you could give me some insights/suggestions on the following:\n\n1. I really hope to do my PhD at my dream school, in the exact department that I've applied to be a master's student. Can anyone let me know if doing a master's at the same school as your intended school for PhD is a significant advantage? That is, does it increase my chances to get in (e.g., by becoming familiar with the faculty), or is there an alternative to this? I also feel it unwise to pay so much more when I can pay less at this stage. My field is one of the humanities/social sciences, for context.\n2. I've asked for a offer acceptance deadline extension from programme B, called the department as well, but I have not received any reply. Since the deadline is around the corner, I wonder: can I rescind my acceptance later, if I really change my mind? Admission to programme B is very competitive and I feel bad about rescinding . . .\n\nAnyway, please let me know what you think &amp; thanks for any suggestions!",

I guided them through/performed the analyses. \n\nShortly after this the student graduated, started a residency and completely ghosted us. The student had started a draft of the manuscript, but had only gotten through the introduction. I took complete control over the project and in the process changed some of our analysis methodology. I proceeded to write the entire manuscript (didn’t end up using any of the intro the student wrote) with the analyses and visualizations that I generated.\n\nAs I was in the weeds of taking control of the project, the senior PI said she was making me co-first author. I was fine with this as I have never been first author before. Now after finishing the paper, I asked if my name can be listed first (still co-first author with the student) rather than second. The PI acknowledged that I carried this study, but says she isn’t sure it’s appropriate since the student conceptualized the study and “attempted” the analyses, even if their work wasn’t utilized. Mind you, the student has been copied on all communication for the last 6 months and has not reached out once.\n\nTo me it seems crazy for someone to be granted first authorship after completely abandoning a project, especially since most of their work wasn’t included anyway.

I want to be a “data scientist” (quotes because the role can be different titles based on the company). For the longest time I’ve been interested in the computational and statistical aspects of data science, as well as computational social science and behavioral data science. I am also heavily interested in the intersection of social and computational science, but can’t seem to find a direct degree path for such a career. Through my engineering program, i’ve had experience with R, Python, SAS, MATLABs, and some brief machine learning projects. We’ve also covered research design and experimentation. \n\nI was thinking about what program I’d like to go for, and for the longest time I was thinking applied statistics. However, I noticed that I myself spend a lot of my time learning the software side of data science that I don’t completely  from my classes and wanted to expand on my interest in machine learning applications to social sciences.  I enjoy math (specifically statistics), but I just see a pattern in myself right now that i put an emphasis on learning tools outside the theory, which makes me wonder whether an applied stats or data science degree would be the better option (or if there is some alternative?)\n\nI’ve heard some applied stats programs do have a software aspect and it’s not all theory, but many seem to be lacking in heavier computer/data science concepts. I am also mainly looking for online programs so I can gain working experience though my graduate studies and there seems to be a plethora of options related to data science but they have less “historical backing” than those related to applied statistics. \n\nWhat do you all think? Would a computational social science degree even be worth looking into? For those of you have have done either an applied stats/stats masters or a data science masters, what can you speak on the programs? I know it comes down to what I’m interested in, but where do some of these programs fall short/benefits? What may be differences in career outlooks? \n\nThank You!",

The grad student is serving as my postdoc advisor's stooge, and they are walking all over me. It is causing me so much mental anguish and anxiety. I worked hard my entire life and thought coming to MIT for postdoc would be the best experience I'd ever have. Boy was I wrong. People here are savages, and they will stab you in your face and not even be fazed by it. Science is not the hardest thing, it is the people. I don't know how to deal with my advisor and the grad student. Whoever survived a toxic postdoc advisor and went on to stay in academia, please give me some advice.",
