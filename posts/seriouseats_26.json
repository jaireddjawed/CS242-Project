        "text": "So I followed this [Serious Eats panettone recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/12/easy-panettone-recipe-with-buttermilk.html) I found which sounded pretty good.  Weighed everything properly on digital scales, and I'm pretty confident that I got the measurements correct.  Mixed it all in a stand mixer as suggested for the indicated quantity of time.\n\nI made three different sizes of panettone from the mix; 80g, 350g and 750g.  I baked according to instructions in the recipe, but I significantly reduced baking time for the smaller ones; about 25 minutes for the mini one, 35 for the medium and then 45 for the full sized one (as the recipe suggested).\n\nTo be fair, the flavour is pretty good.  The texture is...not.  I've got something closer to a scone than a panattone, it's quite bready and nowhere near delicate or buttery.  The texture is so tight and short and I'm not really sure why.\n\nI have a couple of observations from the process which may be related to this:\n- The biga seemed very dry to me.  I've no idea what it's supposed to look like, but it only *just* came together.  Then when I left it overnight it didn't double in size, probably increased about 50%\n- The dough was pretty sticky when I'd finished it and as I put it into the moulds.  You needed to have some flour on the counter and hands to handle it.\n- The second rise of the panettone was really good, easily went 2-3 times the size I would say\n- I baked until the colour matched the recipe picture, although it does look a little darker than I would expect from a store-bought one.  Could be the egg wash though.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with either this recipe of panettone in general?\n\n[Here are a couple of photos of the result; as you can see, the texture doesn't look at all correct.](https://imgur.com/a/F1uQ2)",

        "text": "I've spatchcocked my Turkey for the last 3 years to great results. Beautiful crispy skin from breast to thigh. The only \"problem\" (and it's not really a problem per se, more an observation) is the legs and thighs tend to just sit on the platter untouched by guests. They're far too large for anyone one person to add to their plate. You can't carve them, there's bones 'n stuff.  You could pull the meat off in hunks and serve it up alongside the breasts, but that defeats of the purpose of spatchcocking and you lose all that crispy skin.  So I'm thinking of changing up my method next Thanksgiving to put the dark meat more in the spotlight; it's the tastiest portion of the turkey after all.   I think I'm going to try Rhulman's braised turkey method where the breast gets nice and browned/crispy but the legs slowly braise in the stock below. I personally think dark meat benefits from braising more than dry heat. In doing so I can serve the crispty-skinned breast along side very juicy pulled dark meat. You do lose the crispy skin on the legs &amp; thighs but that seems like a fair trade-off. Anyone noticed a similar conundrum of guests not reaching for that delicious 4lb bone-in turkey thigh? ",

I followed the instructions nearly to a T, and everything looked and smelled amazing. I used the correct tomatoes. My sauce stayed in the oven for 6ish hours - it reduced and darkened like it was supposed to, and just generally seemed to be going well. \nI took it out of the oven, took out the carrots/onions etc. - stirred in the uncooked tomatoes - seasoned the sauce.......the end result was a sauce that was way too sour. \n\n\nCould the problem be that I reserved too much of the tomatoes for the end? Anyone else had the same experience? Any help appreciated! I'm pretty disappointed and want to try again! \n\nEdit: Is there anything I can do to counteract the sourness at this point? Would cooking longer help or worsen the problem?",

I’m a beginner so I’m sorry if it is something obvious, just genuinly curious about this.\n1) Everybody on the internet says that gas burners are the best thing ever and nothing can beat them. I don’t see the logic behind this statement, aren’t induction cookers more powerful and distribute heat more evenly? For example my de Buyer carbon steel pan came with a notice that if using induction cookers I shouldn’t put it on heat higher that 6 (out of 10 max). \n2) The next question is about honing steels. Everyone says that honing doesn’t actually take off any material from the blade. I believe it, however, my gut says that when two metals are scraping each other, some amount of material should come off. \nCan anyone elaborate on these statements, preferably ELI5?

Saw it in a Cooks Illustrated recipe.\nAny other tips or potential gotchas would be appreciated.",

        "text": "It's about that time of year where I should have been thinking about my Thanksgiving dinner awhile ago, but only started today. I've been using a very slightly modified version of Alton Brown's recipe for the last 7 Thanksgivings, to perfect result every single time. The strongest testament to my turkey is that 1) people have been unwilling to purchase turkey to eat anymore and 2) people who've hated turkey on Thanksgiving, have absolutely loved mine.\n\nI've been mostly indoctrinated into Kenji's school of thought, but with Thanksgiving rolling around the corner, I was curious if anyone had tried both methods (Kenji's dry brine recipe, vs. Alton's wet brine recipe), and if they could compare/contrast or provide insight into the differences? I would hate to try a new method this year and disappoint my guests (also, I realize I should have experimented on this earlier, but such is life), but I also recognize Kenji's extensive experimentation on wet brines. If you've made both, which did you like better?\n\nThank you for the help!\n\nRecipes for reference below.\n\n**[Alton Brown's Turkey](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/good-eats-roast-turkey-recipe-1950271)** \n(Note: The text recipe is missing the part about a foil shield, which is constructed and placed on the turkey after the breast part reaches perfect temperature, to prevent it from overcooking.

In order to get more chicken flavor for an \"authentic stuffing@, I was also going to spatchcock 2 chickens, and place them on baking racks above the stuffing so that any drippings are collected by the stuffing.\n\nThe stuffing says to cook at 375 F, but the chickens are recommended to cook at 500 F. Because the chickens will be above the stuffing and \"shielding\" the stuffing, can I cook at a higher temperature? Or, is there any issue with just cooking at a lower temperature for longer (i.e. Will the chicken skin not get as crispy?)\n\nOr should I scrap this and cook these individually / staggered?",

Best I could come up with was toasting whole wheat french bread (levain) in a pan with sea salt and butter and then rubbing raw garlic into the crust.

It would be super helpful for those of us who refer to it every year, but want to introduce some variety by easily identifying recipes/techniques we have not used before. Especially because I know SE's does additional testing between years and recommends new techniques/recipes as superseding previous iterations. ",

I assume the oven temperature difference is because of the baking steel, is this correct?\n\nMy main question was really why you two differ so much on this? I tend to overlook my chicken because perfectly cooked chicken seems to have a funky texture. Would I be better off with Alton’s doneness temperatures?",
