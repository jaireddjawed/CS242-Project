        "text": "**[Spoilers follow]**\n\nAlthough critics praise director Rian Johnson for taking Star Wars in a bold and new direction, I can’t help but feel like I’ve missed something. The Last Jedi is easily the best directed film in the saga, but there are still fundamental script issues that many have overlooked for the sake of enjoying the sequel.\n\nIn this analysis, I’m going to focus on why the script for The Last Jedi is mechanically weak. This isn’t about a matter of taste, like some criticisms have stated about misplaced humor making the film “not feel like Star Wars.” Instead, I’m going to make an argument for something that isn’t up to debate — the fact that the story doesn’t go anywhere.\n\n**There are no consequences.**\n\nIn The Last Jedi, a lot happens. But not a lot happens for long. Leia’s sudden and unexpected death only proceeds her jarring return to life.\n\nKylo Ren’s betrayal of Snoke, which leads to a team-up with Rey and himself against Snoke’s guards, implies his redemption… But it isn’t long lasting as his actions hardly reflect his intentions. After the fight, he has to explain himself to Rey, and how they still aren’t on the same side.\n\nThis is a classic break from “show, don’t tell.” Kylo has to tell us his motives for the scene to make sense. He essentially retcons the entire sequence, because it might as well not have happened. The scene ends up telling us nothing new. Kylo Ren is a bad guy. But we were already aware of that. Actions should speak for a character, but in the most powerful scene of the film, they don’t.\n\nThe Force Awakens already established how deep Kylo is in the dark side when he kills his own father, Han Solo. Despite the film questioning Kylo’s allegiance with the First Order, it doesn’t follow through. The only impact it has is a title change for Kylo Ren, who now takes on the role of Supreme Leader.\n\nLastly, when Luke finally faces Kylo, there’s a moment where we’re meant to believe this is the end for the Jedi Master. It seems as if Luke has accepted his fate as Kylo runs toward him with his blade drawn. Luke literally tells him something similar to what Ben Kenobi tells Darth Vader: “If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.”\n\nLuke seems fearless. But then, we realize Luke has nothing to fear after all. He’s not even actually there. This scene is meant for us to anticipate Luke’s death, only for it to be revealed he’s fine… Only for it to be revealed a moment later that he dies anyway.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, Luke fades into the air twice. He may have taken away Kylo Ren’s satisfaction in killing him, but does that really change anything? Luke might go out on his own terms, but his final appearance before Kylo leads to his death regardless. It’s contrived.\n\n**The twist is there isn’t a twist.**\n\nThe Force Awakens sets up two big mysteries. First, it questions Rey’s backstory. In multiple scenes, we’re teased that her lineage matters in the grand scheme of things.\n\nWhen she meets BB-8, she asks, “Where do you come from?” and after it beeps, she replies, “Classified? Me too. Big secret.” When she’s with Finn, she tells him she has to get back to Jakku because her family is supposed to return for her. When she leaves Han to find the lightsaber in Maz’s castle, Maz asks, “Who’s the girl?” and before we can hear an answer, the scene cuts away.\n\nIn Force Awakens, Rey has to face the fact that her family is never coming back. Once she overcomes this, she continues on her adventure. But, the audience is still left wondering who her family is. What happened to her parents that they would leave her on Jakku? Why are we spending so much time hearing about her family? The implication is that they have relevance beyond reasons given in Episode VII.\n\nThe twist in Last Jedi turns out to be, her family just didn’t care about her, and she’s still in denial over it, even though she overcame some of that same denial in Force Awakens. Not only is it a repetitive plot point, it’s unnecessary to what she’s already come to terms with. Her family isn’t coming back, and she knows it.\n\nHowever, this is also problematic in another way and breaks away from the continuity and narrative arc of Force Awakens. It seems as if Johnson and LucasFilm forgot that Rey isn’t concerned with who her parents are. We are. The audience cares about who her family is. Rey cares about when they’ll come back, and what happened to them. **The film confuses the audience’s questions with the characters’ questions.**\n\nIt’s understandable that Johnson would’ve been so focused on who her parents are, like the fans were, that he forgot this is meant to be a multifaceted reveal. The answer to who Rey’s family is has direct implications on what happened to them, how she is gifted with the force, and possible new motivation that will strengthen her character throughout the rest of the trilogy.\n\nThe second mystery we’re given in Force Awakens has to do with Snoke, a character who seems to be pulling the strings of the First Order. We’re shown snippets of him, hinting he has a larger role in the story than we see.\n\nBut he doesn’t. Similarly to the reveal of Rey’s parents, Snoke is purely a plot device. His death is for shock value, and there isn’t the sense of satisfaction there could’ve been had we known more about his intentions.\n\nThe Last Jedi dismisses these two purposed questions as being the wrong questions. Rey doesn’t come from anywhere meaningful, and exists to be a hero. Snoke is no one important, and exists to be defeated so another character can be the lead villain.\n\n**That’s not what a red herring is.**\n\nCritics have discarded these questions that were raised in Force Awakens as being red herrings. But the thing is, they aren’t red herrings at all.\n\nA red herring is “something, especially a clue, that is or is intended to be misleading or distracting.” A red herring is meant to “distract from the real issue.” If these were red herrings, they would be distracting us from something else going on.\n\nSo, what were we being distracted from? Were we being distracted from Rey being a strong character? (We knew this from her actions in going up against Kylo Ren despite not having any experience.)\n\nWere we being distracted from Kylo Ren being strong enough to kill Snoke, a character he has little emotional connection with? (We knew this from his actions in killing his own father, who he has emotional connection with.)\n\nThe most classic example of a red herring happens to be in A New Hope, when Ben Kenobi tells Luke his father was killed by Darth Vader. This gives Luke motivation to fight the Empire. Eventually in The Empire Strikes Back, it’s revealed Vader is his father. This gives him motivation to try and redeem Vader.\n\nIt’s as if the red herring and reveal from both films were switched. We’re introduced to Rey as being somebody integral, mirroring how Luke comes to realize he’s the antagonist’s son. In Last Jedi, we’re told she’s just a scavenger after all, mirroring how we assume Luke is just a farmer’s nephew when we first meet him.\n\nThis reversal de-elevates the plot in how it takes away potential character motivation. **Worse, it tells us we already know everything we need to know.**\n\n**And that’s the most boring, uneventful thing a story can tell an audience.**\n\nRey’s motivation ends up being the same as Kylo’s motivation as they both follow their own paths. While this mirroring might be interesting, it’s also underdeveloped. We’re told they both pursue light and dark, simply because that’s what they want. There are no real complications or conflicts of interest in their pursuits depicted throughout the film. They are easy decisions.\n\nKylo’s hesitation to blast Leia during a space battle might seem as if his internal struggle has weight to it. But, Leia’s section of the ship is blown apart anyway by another Tie Fighter. Again, Kylo’s conflict has no real impact on events that take place. His reaction to Leia briefly falling into space is glossed over. He isn’t angered, and he doesn’t even seem to be aware of what happens.\n\n**Character arcs are repetitive.**\n\nLike how Rey faces further denial to overcome issues of belonging, Finn also faces something he’s already dealt with in The Force Awakens.\n\nWhen matters become increasingly dangerous in Episode VII, Finn packs up his stuff at Maz’s Castle and is ready to leave… until the First Order interrupts and he realizes he needs to use his training for the greater good. He needs to save Rey. He needs to fight for what he loves, not just fight against what he hates.\n\nThis is Finn’s character arc in both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.\n\nAfter a maintenance worker named Rose catches Finn attempting to leave the Resistance, she prevents him from abandoning the cause. She knows about Finn from stories she’s heard, and she wouldn’t let such a hero turn his back. In a lot of ways, she stands in for the fanbase. She holds her heroes to a standard. Rose wants honesty and integrity from the people who have inspired her. She wants Finn to be a selfless hero, not a selfish coward.\n\nBut we’ve seen this already. Finn faced Kylo Ren after Rey was thrown against a tree and knocked unconscious. Finn already proved himself when he risked his life for a girl and the rest of the Resistance.\n\n**This theme undermines itself.**\n\nWhen Finn lives up to Rose’s expectations that we already knew he lived up to, she prevents him from following through on his sacrifice.\n\nRose and Finn’s positions are flipped. Now, Rose selfishly saves Finn because she cares about him. She decides she was wrong before. Her heroes shouldn’t have to sacrifice themselves… Except, that’s what heroes do. That’s what her sister did.\n\nThis is how the film wants to have its cake and eat it too. Finn is made selfless once again, and he’s still alive. The First Order can destroy the Resistance in this moment, but it doesn’t. And that’s one reason as to why we’re presented with nothing to fear.\n\n**The antagonists aren’t a threat.**\n\nThis criticism about the First Order seems to be common. General Hux was turned into comedic relief. Snoke was defeated unceremoniously. The villains end up lacking substance and come off like cartoon bad guys.\n\nEven when they have all twenty or so defenseless members of the Resistance in their midst with numerous armored tanks and a blaster cannon at their advantage, they don’t do anything about it. Again, there’s no consequence to a dire situation where the stakes should feel higher than ever. The First Order could win the war and end the saga by pressing a button. But nothing happens.\n\nThe film further minimizes its villains when we see the origin of Kylo Ren in a flashback sequence that’s expanded upon a few times.\n\nThe way Ben Solo initially turns on Luke Skywalker ends up being a classic case of “it’s not what it looks like” — even though it’s exactly what it looks like. We might understand where Luke is coming from, but we side with Ben.\n\nThese flashbacks are meant to show Luke’s failure and Kylo Ren’s tragedy, but they’re at the cost of believable storytelling. Ben’s turn to the dark side is finalized by a scene that feels laughable.\n\nAnakin’s lure to the dark side feels more plausible in Revenge of the Sith when he sees a vision of his wife dying, and knows only Palpatine can help him.\n\n**We end in the same place we started.**\n\nFinally, this fits in with my first point: The Last Jedi is surprisingly inconsequential despite killing off two of its most influential characters. If Luke and Snoke have weight on the film, shouldn’t their deaths feel like they matter?\n\nUnfortunately, the second episode in a trilogy breaks the most fundamental rule of storytelling: progression. Everyone knows the age-old rule. A story either opens on a downer and ends on a lighter note, or vice versa. Instead, this film opens and closes with both the Resistance and the First Order in bad places, particularly the Resistance is losing both times.\n\nThis is what makes it cheap storytelling. It’s just as cohesive as the stories told by children going around in a circle, making up sentences one at a time to tell one larger improvisation.\n\nThe Last Jedi suffers from neglecting why its predecessors worked, trying too hard to “let the past die” and follow its own course. But the most detrimental narrative flaw is, nothing that takes place has an effect on anything else that takes place.\n\nCharacter motivations are only slightly altered, if at all. The state of the war remains the same, if not simply worse for both sides. Character growth feels stagnant, if not nonexistent.\n\nStories, especially epics like Star Wars, should follow through on the impact characters have on one another, but The Last Jedi fails to present anything truly groundbreaking.\n\n&gt;Thank you for reading!

        "text": "The gay male canon - coming-of-age stories and romances - is filled with works that punish their characters in various (realistic) ways. I'm thinking of *The Line of Beauty*, *Maurice*, *Giovanni's Room*, *Brokeback Mountain*, *Moonlight*, *A Single Man*, etc. The audience is implored to empathize with how extreme the characters' pain/sacrifice is relative to their (perhaps sinful and certainly socially unacceptable) desires.\n\nWith that context, Call Me By Your Name plays like a fairy tale, even though they don't live happily ever after (still waiting on that). A positive fantasy [that doesn't concern itself with sociopolitical concerns](http://lwlies.com/articles/call-me-by-your-name-book-queer-phenomenon/) is a welcome respite from the canon. Perhaps surprisingly, the film reinforced for me the importance of representation in media. It's exhilarating to have a well-made, unpunished romance that reflects my own feelings. That exhilaration is reinforced by the Proustian/Guadagninan stylings - CMBYN got me swimming in teenage memories both invigorating and embarrassing.\n\nThe story turns its main sources of potential conflict or questions - Elio and Oliver’s age disparity and the reaction of Elio's parents and friends - and uses them to reinforce the positivity on display. Elio is the aggressor/desirer, Oliver is very diligent asking for explicit consent, Elio's parents bless the relationship, apparently talking with both of them in more or less explicit terms, even Marzia acknowledges and accepts Elio. This is a fantasy, but one to aspire to. Instead of touching on these issues through conflict or worry, the story models a guide for how a relationship like theirs could work and in a healthy way.\n\nIt is an unrealistic dream for a gay teen to find a sexually experienced golden god that is also an empathy machine as one's 'first time'. Let alone for his friends and family to embrace it. As an audience member I bring that skepticism with me. I can't help it - it's been reinforced by every other gay story I've read/seen! The story doesn't dispel my skepticism, it's just a respite. And, I imagine Guadagnino is very conscious of that irony.",

        "author": "cattymills",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7nmxh5/david_bordwell_tell_dont_show_how_long/",
        "text": "This blog post from Bordwell (on Observations on Film Art) goes somewhat against the grain of the common, sensible (and perhaps trite) maxim, “Show, don’t tell.” In it, Bordwell mounts a very convincing defense of the merit of sometimes opting for supposedly “stagy” long monologues instead of resorting to flashbacks or some other more clearly visual approach: “In their urge to picture every bit of action, contemporary filmmakers may be missing a chance to exploit another resource of cinema: the sustained scene in which a character talks about a past event without any visual supplement.” \n\n***\n\n[“Tell, don’t show”]( http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2010/01/06/tell-dont-show/)\n--\n\nBordwell believes that “a long verbal account of the past has unique virtues,” and analyzes some famous, effective lengthy film monologues to demonstrate this.\n\n***\n\n**PERSONA**\n\n- He analyzes, of course, the 7-minute monologue in which Ana describes a sexual experience with some children “while her lover was away,” **highlighting that words often can have a more vivid, powerful effect than what they are actually describing.**\n\n&gt;*…Alma describes the incident. She mentions a few details, such as the weather on the isolated beach and the blue ribbon on her straw hat. Mostly, though, she simply describes what happened, in laconic but vivid sentences. The result is an anecdote of absorbing eroticism. Lacking any images of the events, we get to imagine the scene of sexual exchange. Bergman releases us from what James once called “weak specificity”: perhaps no imagery this side of pornography could be as arousing as this bare-bones account.*\n\n- **The present recounting of events of the past creates two flows of events, which can have its own power.**\n\n&gt;*…But the fairly neutral words are given emotional coloration through Alma’s manner of telling. Her reaction mixes astonishment at the pleasure, guilt at betraying her lover, and shame in telling it to Elisabeth.  By the end, she collapses into weeping confusion; the incident has made her doubt what sort of person she is. Here Bibi Andersson’s performance is crucial, with trembling sincerity giving way to anguish and self-reproach.*\n\n&gt;*In sum, by presenting this monologue wholly in the present, Bergman gives us two layers of action simultaneously, a charged sex scene and its long-range emotional consequences.*\n\n- **In brief:**\n\n&gt;*By telling rather than showing, then, Bergman has been able to tell and show. Bergman lets Alma’s telling provide a sort of virtual flashback, while he also creates a ripening interchange between characters in the present. Instead of simply sandwiching fragments of the past into the present action, he has built up two smooth arcs of action, one that we imagine and one that is set before us in precise detail, with its own emotional modulation. The bliss of the past events is refracted through the pain of telling them.*\n\n***\n\n**PSYCHO**\n\n- Bordwell also looks at the infamous psychiatrist monologue at the end of *Psycho*, **which ostensibly explains the murders.**\n\n&gt;…*the psychiatrist Dr Richmond explains the young man’s split personality—part Norman, part Mrs. Bates, his mother. Richmond claims to have gotten the truth “from the mother.” At this point, he says, the Mom part of Norman has taken over wholly, a claim confirmed when we hear Norman speak in an old lady’s voice in the epilogue. Richmond goes on to claim that his questioning determined that Mother “killed the girl.” To get literal, it was as Mother that Norman murdered Marion Crane.*\n\n- **This scene demonstrates how monologues can inject uncertainty and doubt as opposed to generally more objective flashbacks** (though now with the prevalence of “lying flashbacks” the benefit is less obvious).\n\n&gt;*A contemporary film would very likely replay the murder so as to validate the psychiatrist’s analysis: Norman dressing up as his mother, assuming a cackling old-bat accent, killing Marion in images that fill in the silhouette that we saw in the shower sequence. We would see that Norman-as-Mother is the culprit.*\n\n&gt;*But this visual confirmation of Richmond’s diagnosis would be made problematic by the epilogue that Hitchcock includes. In the final sequence we see Norman, staring out at the camera, and hear Mother’s voice declaring that her son committed the murders. According to her, Norman is the culprit; she wouldn’t hurt a fly. How then can Richmond declare that Mother told him that she killed the girl?*\n\n&gt;*We might say that the doctor is extrapolating: the truth he took from the mother is that she is dissembling, shifting the guilt to Norman. But Richmond could have stated that was his reasoning, and he doesn’t. The incompatibility between his explanation and Mother’s soliloquy opens up the possibility that he has not probed to the depths of Norman’s madness.*\n\n&gt;*Despite the fact that the psychiatrist’s analysis arrives at the moment when a conventional movie delivers the whole truth, the very last minutes of the film incline me to doubt Richmond’s ability to grasp the whole situation. It’s as if our parting vision of the character disturbs the smug certainties of the diagnosis.*\n\n***\n\n**IN CONCLUSION**\n\n&gt;*Show, don’t tell is usually good advice. But I’m suggesting a codicil. Consider showing the telling. Fill it out. Pack it with actorly detail and psychological implication. Stage and shoot and cut it so as to create an engrossing, unfolding rhythm. That’s visual storytelling too, and it requires fine judgment. Who knows? More scenes relying on telling might also teach audiences to be a little patient.*\n\n***\n\nAny other monologue from other films that you guys think are particularly effective? Why?\n\nAny examples of flashbacks from other films that you guys think would be better as monologues? Why?\n\n\n\n",

One very prominent argument that I see on a constant basis in the argument of under representation. Obviously this is a sensitive topic, so let me be clear in stating that my intentions are not to insult or offend. That being said...\n\nWhat, in your opinion, counts as unfair representation, or under representation? \n\nAbout a week ago, I was reading an [article](https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2017/12/26/pulling-the-plug-on-hollywood-whitewashing.html) in the Toronto Star about the problem of whitewashing in Hollywood cinema. While many of the points in the article had merit (specifically, the problematic trend of having white actors portray characters of different ethnicities), one point seemed weak to me. In the article, the author breaks down the percentage of roles in top Hollywood films, based on their actors ethnicities, in an attempt to prove that certain groups are underrepresented. The numbers are as follows:\n\n70.8% White\n13.6% Black \n5.7% Asian \n3.1% Hispanic \nLess than 1% Indigenous\n\nUpon first glance, it seems clear that there is a representation issue in Hollywood. However, when comparing these numbers to the [demographics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States) of the U.S.A., an interesting observation can be made. Almost all of the numbers more or less align with the percentage of their populations within the U.S., where Hollywood is obviously based. The major exception to this is in Hispanic representation, where there is a major discrepancy.\n\nShould representation be equal no matter what? Or should it reflect the demographics of the nation? \n\nI’m interested to hear some perspectives on this issue! ",

        "text": "Happy New Year =)\n\nI just watched Alien Covenent...Mother! is next on my list.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Based upon the reviews and word of mouth Covenant got, it looked like it was a passable movie, which is what I did when it was released in theaters.  I now regret that decision.\n\nSpoilers ahead, fair warning.\n\nMany people mentioned that it seemed formulaic, and that the crew's decision-making processes seemed to be stupid to the point of unbelievability.  I think some of that criticism is valid, but IMHO those are minor quibbles for a blockbuster film, which Covenant very much intended to be.  \n\nWhat seemed to weigh the movie down more than anything else was the legacy established by its predecessor, Prometheus.  Looking at the scripts, themes, and overall vision for the movie, Prometheus was IMHO easily one of the most ambitious movies to have come out in recent memory:\n\n1)  There's a dual theme of creation, between Wyland and David, and between humanity and the engineers, one which the movie attempted, but IMHO ultimately failed to explore in a cohesive manner.  There are no distinguishable parallels between the two, which makes one question the reasoning behind the juxtaposition of the two sets of creator/creation subjects.  What were the motives of the engineers?  We simply do not know, even by the end of the movie.  They turn violent...why?  Again, no answers.  Does their behavior mimic how humans treat synthetics?  Not really.  What about David?  What are his motivations?  They are as ambiguous as the engineers, which makes little sense since David is the creation, not the creators.  All of the footage of the engineers inside theirs ship grappling with the Alien menace are unexplained by the end of the movie.  Prometheus is plagued by these and many more unanswered questions. It's as if they were consciously trying to denounce the theory behind Chekov's gun, and failed to such an extent as to reaffirm it a million-fold.\n\n2) The cinematography is majestic, that being an understatement, and is easily one of the best aspects of the movie.  \n\n3) The consequences of a corporate CEO attempting to find the meaning of life and to achieve some sort of godhood precedes Bladerunner2049 exploring similar themes...unfortunately this again was flawed because most of the corporate aspect of the film got subsumed by the family drama between Wyland and his daughter, which, was that supposed to be a surprise?  Why does the movie hide such a simple fact and 'reveal' it in such an under-dramatic manner?  It doesn't add to the plot nor does it create any suspense with anything resembling a payoff.  IMHO the Charlize Theron character was poorly written to a criminal degree, and wasted the talents of one of my favorite actresses.  \n\n4) The crew's choices and decisions were far worse than what was depicted in Alien Covenant.  At first they're all in sealed suits, but them some of the crew inexplicably take them off - at least for Covenant the crew seemed to be fairly untrained and resembled eager colonists with a rank more than the representatives of a corporation with trillion dollar interests at stake.  The crew in Prometheus show evident signs of training, and evident signs of the exact opposite.  This contradiction is IMHO what makes the characters in Prometheus such a frustrating bunch to empathize with.  \n\n---\n\nTo compare, Alien Covenant does its best to fix the myriad problems with Prometheus, while keeping the aspects that work.\n\n1) We see that Wyland treats David as little more than a slave, a tool through which Wyland seeks immortality. This explains a lot of David's motivations in Prometheus, how David does not appreciate how his creators treated him and thus has a strong beef with humanity.  David's treatment of the Alien species, what he essentially deems his own creations, seeks to fix the problems he sees in how he himself was treated.  He attempts and succeeds in developing empathy with the species.  He trains them in order for the Aliens to prosper to the best they can, given the lack of food on the planet for them (lack of non-botanical biomass).  The engineer subplot is completely jettisoned, and it isn't missed...their motivations didn't make any sense to begin with so why bother trying to fix something that never worked in the first place?  The use of Noomi Rapace's character as a surrogate and (likely) food source for the Aliens is a form of poetic justice for David, as he 'honors' her by using her as a vehicle through which he emulates his own creators by creating himself.  Never mind the moral implications of how he murdered her, even though he fully acknowledges that she was kind to him and treated him with respect...that is admittedly a bit of a plot hole that Alien Covenant doesn't resolve.  I'm OK with it because it could have been the setup for a third movie in the franchise, perhaps explaining exactly what David and Noomi Rapace did on that ship and what they experienced on the engineer planet.  There is also a theme in how Walter is an imperfect creation, lacking may aspects of humanity that David possessed, and thus Walter in the end was 'retired' by David, a sort of statement of the meaning and significance behind the act of creating - what if we treated our children the way Wyland 'developed' Walter?\n\n2) The cinematography is again majestic and is something I would yearn to see in future movies even outside the Alien franchise.\n\n3) There is no corporate drama in this movie, which eliminates this source of frustration in Prometheus.\n\n4) As explained already, the crew did not seem to be as well-trained as that of Prometheus, thus it seems a bit more forgivable for them to have been caught with their pants down, sometimes literally.  \n\n---\n\nAll in all, I was extremely impressed by the visuals and that the plot, themes, and acting were very good for a blockbuster.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable treat that did not leave a regrettable aftertaste.  It actually IMHO is a movie that lingers in the mind afterward, much like Bladerunner (although this where the forgivable aspects of the film become less forgivable), while suffering none of the pacing issues of the latter movie.  8.5/10",

        "text": "Every image has a message. Every message has a language on with it lays upon. Every language has its rules and conventions.\nSo, what are images' rules and conventions?\n\nMusic has an instinctive aspect to it, every person from every culture knows that a minor chord is sad, and a major chord is happy, even those without any initiation in musical theory.\nDoes this universality exist when talking about images?\n\nIn a 2001 experiment, Dr. Ramachandran showed figures and words to english and tamil speaking subjects, and asked them to put them together. The results were unmistakable. [95% to 98% of people called the figure on the right 'Kikki', and the one on the left 'Booba'.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Booba-Kiki.svg)\nWhat does this mean? It shows clearly that images have an intrinsic meaning in our minds, even before intellectualization.\nFor more extreme and common examples, we can compare a [Mondrian](https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mondrian_Composition-No.-III-Composition-with-Red-Blue-Yellow-and-Black.jpg) with a [Pollock](https://i1.wp.com/www.guggenheim.org/wp-content/uploads/1950/01/91.4046_ph_web.jpg).\nFor more representational and subtle examples, we can compare [Monet](https://imgur.com/a/GxD1I) with [Wanderer Above the Sea Fog](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg).\n\nSo, it can be said that there's an universal visual language we all share. This is where film comes from. It's not the first time that the moving pictures have been called the universal language, but i want to go deeper than that. I want to know whats the smallest unit of meaning in this language. A letter is the smallest unit in literature, as a note is in music.\n\nNow, here we have to make a distinction, so far we are speaking only in visual terms, so this seems more applied to painting than cinema, what's there to say that's not yet been said?\nCinema's biggest difference from painting is that it uses the real, actual world as raw material. Film is inherently representational, and has to make an effort to be abstract; painting is the opposite.\n(It's worth to be clear now that we are focusing only in live action filmmaking. Animation in all its incredible and varied forms is being left out because of this fundamental difference; it goes from abstract to representational, rather than vice versa)\n\nSo, why is this important, you ask, socratically. Film has to alter its surroundings to accommodate what it needs for them to say. It's not enough to represent something, an image has to be loaded with meaning before it can be considered a succesful message. How is this meaning woven into the image? Trough abstraction.\n\nThis is where framing, lighting, staging, editing and the whole creative spectrum come into play. This is how an old lady holding a knife [becomes terrifying](http://docfilms.uchicago.edu/dev/images/2015/winter/2015-02-27.jpg). Not every image has the same level of abstraction, but all of them use the same tools, so there has to be some common dialect within it all. Staying with Hitchcock's image of the lady with the knife, we can analyze it step by step.\n\nThe dramatic pose adds to the shock and grandeur of the situation; the obscured face provides the mystery; the hair and robe tells us it's an old lady, witch adds to the surprise and bewilderment; the falling water gives more obscurity to her figure, and its the perfect excuse for the constant and monotonous sound; the fact that the scene takes place halfway through the film aids in the wtfness; and of course, there's the music, to wrap it all up.\n\nIn short, I think every aspect of filmmaking works with one another in conveying a specific message. It could be said every department is the responsible for one letter, or one note, and all in unison create chords, or meaning.\n\nIn order to become visually literate, this is the level of scrutiny and specificity that we should demand from cinema and it's images.",

        "text": "First of all, as someone who isn't a native English speaker, I would like to apologize in advance for any mistakes and errors in this text. Also, happy New Year to everyone!\n\nThis is my first post on this subreddit and I've decided to write something about one of my favourite movies. It's called \"H-8\", and it's available to everyone [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkyFuQmh1qE) (with English subtitles, although they aren't always accurate, but the dialogue is easily understood, which I'll get into later). Based on a true event, the story is really simple: there was a fatal collision between a bus and a truck. Within the first five minutes of the film the information about the crash is provided - how, where when, and why it happened, and how many people are dead. Well, except one thing. You don't know who died.\n\nThe story then takes us back to the departure from the bus station. Every character is introduced, but not through an obvious exposition. There are subtle clues which give away their current situations. An actor who, for some reason, has a disdain for doctors. A doctor who, for some reason, has a disdain for journalists, and so on. Although most of the characters don't know each other, some of them are loosely connected. The truck driver and his son also have an interesting backstory which is explored just carefully enough not to become emotionally manipulative.\n\nAfter 10-15 minutes we know which seats in the bus are 'fatal'. We don't know, however, who will be sitting in those seats, because the passenger are constantly changing their seats, which also keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats. That's the thrilling part. And it is really thrilling, which makes this movie a masterpiece in my opinion. We can allow ourselves to get invested in the characters' lives. We can almost 'cheer' for some of them, tell them not to go to the seats which are meant to be for someone else, and to stay in their seats. \n\nThe dialogue is excellent in this movie. Not only because not a word was wasted, but also because of everything that wasn't said. Not everything was laid out clearly. It requires paying attention, and it gets even better on repeated viewings. First time you watch it, you watch it to find out whether your favourite character survived. Second time you watch it, you find out that there are other stories you didn't really think about. Same with the third time. Some movies get boring when you watch them again. Not this one.\n\nI didn't write anything 'philosophical' or anything like that. I don't know a lot about movies to write about underlying themes in this movie, if there are any. I just think that more people should know about \"H-8\". And if you do watch it, I can promise that you won't regret it.",

        "text": "This will be a relatively short post, due to the fact Im talking largely about one scene within the film and not the movie itself. \n\nBlade of the Immortal was officially my favorite film of 2017. I did not expect to say this about a Takashi Miike film, even though I am a huge fan of the director. It was a generally big budget project, and was set up much like many Marvel movies in plot. There was one scene in particular, though, that truly wowed me, and inspired me to write this in the first place. There is a scene where the main character, Manji, has his hand ripped clean off his body, and ends up being dragged to the top of a hill by a chain. What results is an intense, bloody, and amazing action sequence that ended up being surprisingly subtle for what it was. At the end of the fight, Miike could have totally just cut to another character in the movie, but instead, he decided to show the hilarious sequence of Manji trying to get his hand back off the cliff to re-attach it. Its quite dark and gruesome, and I haven't that much at an action flick in a very long time. But most importantly, it did not break the feeling of the movie. It was not trying to undermine the urgency of the plot, nor be lighthearted or break the effect of the movie, it just showed a natural and inevitable truth. \n\nMarvel movies do have a lot of trouble with humor. Although they are usually funny, they havr a hard time justifying the humor in the situation, amd end up usually destroying the initial feel of the movie. But Blade of the Immortal's was perfect to a tee. It was witty, but needed and sensible with the story. Its something that Marvel can really learn from, and one that is proven can still be utterly hilarious without showy jokes or whatever else they use a lot of the time. ",

What I'm looking for is sites that have large database of films from all decades, and as many reviews as possible for each, with the ratings averaged together for one score.\n\nMetracritic is good for new and recent films, but the further back a movie was made the less likely it is to be included (it really drops off pre-2000, and is mostly useless pre-70s).\n\nAlso, what's the difference on Rotten Tomatoes between the \"Tomatometer\" score and the \"average rating\" score? My understanding is Tomatometer is simply if the critic liked it or not, whereas average rating takes into account how much it was liked or disliked. Is this correct? If so, a mediocre but highly likable film could have a 100% Tomatometer score and 5 of 10 average while a brilliant but polarizing film would have a lower Tomatometer even if the average was much higher.",

        "text": "Note : This is a repost with a more suitable title. Hope it works.        \n\nSince Christopher Nolans Dark Knight series ended with a cherished and satisfying end, DC movies havent made me want to rewatch any of their potrayals more than twice.        \n\nWhile Marvel movies have been killing it, ever since the first Iron Man back in 2008. So why ? Well heres to the house of Mickey pulling strings on the Avengers, dreams of green lanterns, and my two cents.        \n\nTaking on a strongly established universe was harder than movie makers may have ever comprehended : We grew up watching cartoons or glancing into comic pages of characters from the DC brand. And so do we have a strong comprehension ingrained into our minds about how they should act or behave. Superman is who he should be, a normal everyday salaried employee earning his bread (That suit and glasses were always figurative). Sure, we can relate to the average joe looking to make it in life and root for him when he unbuttons his suit. That was the principle that Superman is founded on, an unassuming person who has the steely nerves to defend humanity. But above all hes hope personified. I believe Man of Steel almost did the character justice and Zach Snyder had an efficient start with his DCEU.  Almost.      \n  \nAmid the flat surfaces of the polygon, there lies at the centre something that we as an audience want with any character. And that is for him to be more human.     \n\nClark Kent has weaknesses like his worry for Louis, Superman has his like rage motivating his actions, instead of always going with the most right thing to do. 'Man of Steel' explored on this ideology of a rather righteous man, who stoically does things, without much exposition as to why he does it.  The movie may have lost out on tremendous scope for exploring the character from a more human perspective, rather than somebody's expectation of him.  There were other pacing issues too, and lac of a compelling story. Nonetheless i really liked Michael Shannon's General Zod as the villain, and the visuals were awesome too. We know Zack Snyder for the stunning imagery in his work.        \n\nOn the flip side take the Batman introduced in 'Batman vs Superman'. He was the badass nemesis that Superman really needed. Ben Afflecks Batman has strong motives, is not a stoically imposed self righteous figure in anyway. This guy does not give a shite about expectations, and goes out to chart out a strong course for his character. He kills recklessly, because this version of Batman has been finally overcome by the crime he fights, as symbolised by the sadistic words 'Ha Ha' sprayed across what he remembers as his hope for the future (The Joker beats the living shit out of Dick Greyson aka Robin, and i truly dont want to imagine that being Jared Leto).  However that does not save the movie despite Batfleck. Superman who was the first introduced in this version of the DCEU, was still an inflexible part with his righteous ways, and his unclear motives as to why he crossed Batman. Hell, even the motives for why they started fighting and as to why they even stopped was vague (O yeah, Martha). But the fight was good while it lasted, and then they rammed in an overgrown cave troll. Jesse Eisenbergs dyspeptic traits as Lex Luthor was not very compelling either.     \n\nAnd then theres the land of Marvel, where every hero is all kinds of human, grounded and natural.     \n\nTony Stark is rich, flamboyant and ignorant at first. But when he is deprived of what his foundation lays upon, he claws in desparation to create something that gives him definition. (He smites an ugly looking armor out of scratch as a last ditch effort to escape his captors, and in the process he creates his functioning heart).       \n\nSteve Rogers struggles with his emaciated frame to serve his country. While a tranformation into something else gives him definition to go ahead and do much better. One can go on.     \n\nYou see guys, there are two things of importance here. These characters have strong traits that uniquely define them even before they become the essential superhero that we want to see. Steve wouldnt be Captain America, without his gusto in telling those who beat him bloody that he can take more. Second, we get to witness their character arcs. We see what shaped them into the beings that inherit those costumes. Individual Marvel films for each character hammers that in so well, that it becomes almost real.        \n\nTo put it simply DC characters have fictional layers that are hard to tresspass upon. The filmakers who dare to pierce through those biblical layers suceed in creating characters like art. Nolan made his Batman, by not dragging out too much an already established character from the comics. Christian Bales Batman is vulnerable, wears his mask as a hated burden, yet like a sinister vice that we understand so well. Because we actually see his character arc and it makes sense.  Patty Jenkins created her Wonder Woman from scratch and kept it simple, and it was really damn good.         \n\nMarvel characters dont have that duality that DC ones do, making them more 'generic' if that term were okay. And that makes writing them like working with clay, very flexible. And the result is nobody gets pissed that their expectations were not met. Because of which the filmakers have more creative freedom in exploring more about each character. 'Thor Ragnarok' took a very light tone and that did very well, as it centrally explores on how Thor copes without his hammer.        \n\nWe all know that DC studios is reshaping its organisational structure being the top brass, but does that really guarantee anything unless the characters are written from the ground up and in a way that tears our expectations, yet still leaving us invested in them ? Theres a really long wait to ever know.\n\n\n",

My wife and I almost walked out due to the audience reacting is if they were watching a rom-com throughout the entire movie.  Actual knee slapping type laughter that we both felt was very out of place during scenes that were tense but also had a undertone of frightening humor.  This seemed to me as a reaction from an audience unsure how to handle the material and shifting tones.  Most inappropriate audience laughter stems from people being uncomfortable or challenged during a film.  I've experienced this a few times in the past but not to the level where it's a major distraction to the film.\n\nI know this is a relatively new film and not many people have seen it but has anyone else experienced this in their screening?\n\nI know this isn't new to PTA films, Punch Drunk Love created a similar viewing experience at the time.",

Listening to that Bill Simmons podcast with PTA was great, because you hear him say (paraphrasing), “I find it really funny when people take something they believe in so seriously.”\nI’m sure we all think of this movie as this grand repairing of two of cinemas greatest and it is, don’t get me wrong.

However even if I go back nowadays, rewatching it with a more critical eye, I still consider it a masterpiece. The atmosphere the movie creates makes my heart glow. Great music (quite a few tracks from Tito and Tarantula), good acting, grin spanning one liners, Chet's speech, Salma Hayek's snake dance, the plausible dynamic among the Gecko brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) and also the Christians, the Titty Twister, all the other generally interesting characters (like Sexmachine) and the thousand other little details. Maybe only Scott seemed a little redundant haha. To me it feels like a clever movie, as if someone put a lot of thought into creating this twisted little fantasy.\n   I can see how the change from Gangster movie, to sudden Vampire spladder can be off putting. The transition is very rapid, and quite a few of my friends dont like the way the vampires look, being used to twilight and generally more aesthetic looking blood suckers. \n   However modern day action blockbusters seem dumb to me, compared to fdtd. And I am in no way suggesting that its an intelligent movie, just that it's cooler and wittier and more creative maybe, although Tarantino is know to copy pasta a lot.\n\nI love this movie, and I am not a professional, just a fan boy whos probably not very objective, but I have had people tell me its complete trash, not just plotwise. I have not met a single other person who liked it, apart from my brother and dad. Having grown up with this film, I judge other action movies by criteria that this film helped establish.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7mtkq3/how_should_super_dark_times_have_ended_spoilers/",
        "text": "Argh. Super Dark Times is the most frustrating film I've seen in a long time. It's so well-made, well acted, well shot, and just generally a tense and coherent movie, but with an absolute dud of a third act. In fact, it's not even the whole third act, it's just the climax, which feels rushed, poorly set-up, and thematically at odds with the first two thirds of the film.\n\nHere's the crux of my objection to the third act: Josh should not have turned out to be a killer.\n\nThe first and most obvious disservice this fact did the film is that it gave the plot a lame, cliched 'save the damsel' ending, turning an interesting character study and 'rites of passage' film into a boring crime drama.\n\nBut the decision is worse than that, because it also pollutes the film on a thematic level. I really felt that this film, if it is about any one thing, is about teenage libido. There are plenty of motifs which hint at burgeoning sexuality being the thematic heart of this movie, from the opening titles spliced with scrambled porn tapes, to Zack's erotic nightmares, to small moments like the girl sitting behind him in biology jerking off her biro. Like similar coming of age stories (such as It Follows) the deepest fear which underlies everything is the fear of sex. The incident with the sword is not the point of the film, it's a clever way of illustrating the confusion and conflicted feelings teenagers go through when discovering their own sexualities.\n\nZack's desire for Allison is stuck behind a wall of anxiety and self-doubt, and whereas in the film this is partly a result of guilt and partly of jealous rivalry with Josh, we can see how Zack's situation is, more broadly, an illustration of teenage experience (and inexperience).\n\nSo when Zack starts to get increasingly paranoid about his friend, and starts to weave a handful of a small clues into a pattern pointing towards Josh being a killer, I was fully and totally on the side of Charlie during the phone call scene where Zack confesses his suspicions. Every aspect of Zack and his situation seemed to point towards his paranoia being a delusion brought about by his emotional turbulence that the film did such a good job of establishing: his guilt, his jealousy, his lust, his loneliness.\n\nSo how would I resolve this tension bubbling between both boys? Well, some confrontation between Zack and his friend was definitely needed, and since Zack's paranoia about his friend being a killer is really just a surrogate for any teenager's paranoia about their friend seducing their crush, I think a scene winding up in Allison's bedroom is a sound decision. And, hell, why not keep the sword in it? Josh wants to impress Allison: that's logical, and it wouldn't take Sigmund Freud to unpeel the symbolic significance of a boy revealing his uncovered sword to a girl in her bedroom.\n\nSo really, the film can be untouched up to the point where Zack bursts into Allison's bedroom. He comes in, and instead of finding Josh about to go in for the kill, he finds Josh doing exactly what Allison thought Josh was doing: trying to impress them in the only way he seems to know how, by swinging his brother's sword about. Some showdown between both boys would be inevitable, and the obvious resolution would be that the sword in some way injures one of the boys: perhaps Zack wrestles to get the sword off Josh and cuts himself in the process, with Josh clinging onto the sword out of sheer childish stubbornness (and a sort of shame at his friend discovering his pathetic attempt to impress the girls).\n\nBut there must be a better way to end the narrative than this. If this is a film about sexual tension, then the climax ought to be particularly significant. Perhaps an ending which makes better use of Allison - a character who, like in so many other films, is just the sex object: the girl-shaped plot device which drives the actions of our (male) heroes. But I can't think of one. The film is 1 hour 40, so we have about 20 minutes of extra time to play with, and a completely disjointed opening scene to call back to (the stag death). What might be a better ending for this film?",

        "text": "First off, I'm no movie-expert and have a limited knowledge of film, so if I may be off or say something nonsensical, just tell me. \n\nI think everyone has come across a few films where they disagree with the critical consensus or the general audience's opinion. This is no surprise because how we experience films is subjective and there is nothing wrong with enjoying a work most people wouldn't want to watch even if you paid them. \n\nHowever, I assume many people who have some interest in film try to look at a movie objectively and see its merits and flaws. When I thought about this, I realized there's one element I can't see objectively: the score or the music. The story and the writing I can analyze and make out the good and the bad, even if those don't necessarily influence how much I enjoyed the movie. The actor's performance of a character I don't like can still be convincing in itself. Same for the editing where you can see the reasoning behind certain choices; and this list goes on and on. \n______________________________________________\nThe reason I thought about this and my perfect (subjective) example in this regard is Dunkirk. I had a very different experience than most moviegoers and while I can acknowledge it is a really good movie because of the reception it got, I can't \"feel\" it. This is also due to its nature with the intentional lack of characters - how much you enjoyed the film hinges on the atmosphere, the intensity and tension it tries to create. The big reason I didn't feel those things after the frist ~10 minutes is the score and its use. \n\nI could go into detail and also name a few instances in which I think I may have some objective criticism, but those are minor and I don't want to make this post about Dunkirk, so I'll settle for one example: the ticking clock sound. Apparently people like it and while I have heard it creates urgency and while I get how a clock sound is theoretically very fitting in those scenes when time is running. However, I can't understand or give a real reason why I disliked it, but most others didn't. For some reason I found it very distracting and it took me out of the film, just like it happened on other occasions.\n\nPart of the reason why I can't judge a score objectively is my lack of knowledge: I know nothing about music and can essentially only tell you if I like it or not. I am probably not alone in this as analyzing a piece of music requires more skill and knowledge than dissecting a story. \n\n___________\n\nAnyway, this is my long-winded way of asking: \n\nWhat are your areas that you feel are entirely subjective, not only as you watch a film, but also afterwards? If you feel or felt the same way about music in film, have you ever managed to view it more objectively? \n\n__________\nedit: I'm not saying I can be completely objective and I'm also not saying you can look at the different parts of a film individually and rate it based on that; often a movie is greater than the sum of its part (and sometimes it's less). \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "https://i.redd.it/04gicwdksulz.jpg\n\nThe film's opening sequence may have confused some people, specifically as to why the main character, Eliza, is shown masturbating. As it turns out, this scene plays an important role in finding the meaning in \"The Shape of Water.\" Notice the placement of the timer, (fittingly in the shape of an egg,) even her basic pleasures are timed and regimented. This is in stark contrast to her love with the Creature, which is depicted underwater in slow motion, unfettered by time. Eliza's love is like water; it can be contained, but once released, it bursts out- free and lively. Love in itself is like water, just like how water takes any shape it's held in, love exists in many different forms. Eliza's love for the creature frees her from her life. She is able to break away from her strict routine, the world around her changes, and she is finally happy. Eliza has tasted freedom, and freedom is love. She can never go back, so she ultimately decides to leave her old life behind in favor of a new one with the Creature, where she will live happily ever after. The princess symbolism is blatantly stated in the movie, with Eliza being referred to as \"the Princess,\" and the Creature, \"the Prince.\" Eliza's Cinderella-style slippers are also a not so subtle reference. Like Cinderella, Eliza is a lowly cleaning lady at the beginning of the story, but by the end she has transformed, (both literally and figuratively,) into something more. There's also the obvious Beauty and the Beast analogy to be made, but that explains itself. The opening scene calls back to Sleeping Beauty as well.\n\nEliza's love can only exist out of time, for living in the present bogs her life down. The fantasy world is her escape, in it she can not only speak, she can sing and dance too. She chooses it over the harsh real world. Living in this heightened reality is what Giles wishes for as well. He wants to be able to have love at first sight, specifically with the pie server. But he is lying to himself, because love at first sight isn't possible. Life isn't a movie. His self-deception is displayed by his use of a toupee early in the film. He wants that fairy tale life, and it's love that will bring a person there. For when two people are in love, nothing else matters. \"It's just you, and me, together.\" Giles is not allowed this, \"I sometimes feel like I was born too early.. or too late for my time.\" By the end of the movie he learns to stop looking for his fairy tale ending at every corner and to leave his past failures behind him. One day he will find his Prince, but it won't be immediate, it will take hard work, and he has to let go of his past to find him. Eliza and the Creature's experience taught him this. So he ends his unrequited love with his former boss and moves on. His conversation with the Creature in the bathroom is very telling. He asks it if it has always been alone. Giles feels alone in the world, identifying with the creature, a freak of nature. He loses hope, until he sees that even the Creature can find love in this world. He can find love too, but it will take time. He stops lying to himself, and his real hair grows back.\n\nEliza is supposed to be with a man like Strickland but instead she falls for the creature. In this way her having sex with it is her way of embracing freedom. Like the young couples of the 60's counterculture movement, advocating for \"free love,\" Eliza is refusing to follow the cultural norms, which have only lead to people living unhappy, empty lives. She is refusing to be restrained. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Strickland, who's life is ruled by those same cultural restraints. Strickland did everything society expected of him. He delivered. He got himself a wife and two kids, a house, and a nice car. It's a car made for him, the salesman tells him. And he buys into it, because he knows he is expected to. His entire world view is shattered when he finds out that none of it matters. The general dismisses his willingness to fit into society's mold. Because of this, he implodes. His whole life meant nothing, all those years of living in an unhappy marriage, living up to the ideal he thought the world expected of him, it was all for naught. It's no accident that all of the antagonists and unlikable characters in the film represent old-world values, while the protagonists fight for freedom and self expression. Giles is an artist after all. Zelda represents feminism and civil rights, Eliza and Giles both represent free love and free expression. Dimitri represents the fight over believing in ethics or country, which was a battle fought at home over the U.S.'s involvement in Vietnam. Zelda works and makes decisions for herself and her husband while he stays home sitting on the couch all day. She stands in the face of racism daily. Giles's art is shut down by a corporation, and his love is shunned by society. Strickland is totally devoted to his country, even when it goes against his own interests and pushes him aside after he has done so much for it. Meanwhile, Dimitri has little loyalty for one country, he is guided by his moral and scientific standings. He represents the antithesis to the men he serves. His argument with the American general encapsulates this. The general demands submission and respect because of his rank, not his expertise, (of which he is lacking). Strickland admits to Dimitri that he is not a sophisticated man, he always does what he's told. This means he cannot be an independent being, in fact, he has a deep hatred for those who choose independence. This is what makes him the perfect antagonist for our heroes, who are the outcasts and independent thinkers of the world. The Cold War is a backdrop to all of this. The tension and paranoia of the era fuels Strickland's suspicions of these outsiders with abnormal values. But like in a fairy tale, love conquers all. Eliza and the Creature's bond inspires her allies to take action against what they perceive to be oppressors holding them back. Zelda tells her husband how she really feels, Giles confronts his ex/former boss, Dimitri plans to kill the Russians, and they all help Eliza reach her destiny in return for helping them get closer to reaching theirs.\n\nAnother think I noticed, when Eliza is waiting for the bus in one scene, there's a man sitting next to her on the bench with a cake. Eliza has eggs with her which she gives to the Creature throughout the film. I may be looking too much into this, but this could be another symbol for Eliza's loneliness and how she feels like an outcast to the world. She is surrounded by cakes, and she has only an egg, a single ingredient. She feels incomplete, but as she signs to Giles, the Creature does not see her as being incomplete. He accepts the eggs and is grateful for them. In an interview, Guillermo Del Toro said that the eggs themselves are a symbol. That makes sense, considering Eliza is literally offering her eggs to the Creature. First she offers her eggs (food), then she offers her other kind of eggs.\n\nThe film has the feeling of an old movie, or of a classic play. Not just story-wise, but in the tone, the dramatic lighting, (especially in the laboratory,) and the sets. The sets and backgrounds look admittedly cheesy, with the snowy landscape behind Dimitri during his talks with the Russians resembling a matte painting. There's also the lab's background, which is reminiscent of sets from other movies that serve as tongue-in-cheek love letters to classic film, such as Little Shop of Horrors. This was of course intentional, the movie was inspired by The Creature From the Black Lagoon and other classics. Del Toro's film plays with this by actively refusing to follow the conventions of the classic films and stories it was inspired by. In this way The Shape of Water, like Pan's Labyrinth, is a subversive fairy tale. The story may have been told before, (Beauty and the Beast, The Hunchback of Notre Dame,) but Del Toro's mastery over the film medium distinguishes it from similar stories, making for a more personal take on the story than we've seen before. The Shape of Water decidedly rises to the top of the current wave of movies.\n\nReddit User MetaSoshi9 makes some other great points about the religious themes in the film which you can read about [here.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7llz2i/comment/drsux2u)",

        "text": "\"Mother!\" is one of the strangest and most disquieting films I've seen, and as it was unfolding, I was at a loss to describe it.  The word \"allegory\" has been used by the cast, and the details are indeed allegorical, but that does not begin to cover it.  Other words I would use to describe its nature (and do not mistake them for criticisms): Anguished, morbid, visceral, futile, solipsistic, claustrophobic, masochistic, delirious, nightmarish, accusatory, deathly, and despairing.\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, and that the structure in which the film evolves manages to be Dante-esque while having a radically different emotional and moral approach than Dante, I find myself still wondering if this is a new type of film.  How can a film manage to be futile, despairing, and enveloped in Death, but rather than expressing existentialist angst, it expresses a sense of *personal betrayal* and absolute cosmic **moral outrage**? \n\nWhat *is* that?  \n\nBits and pieces of other films could map on to \"Mother!\" but nothing I'm aware of is like it as a whole.  Certainly nothing by Aronofsky himself, nor any other biblically-referenced allegory that comes to mind.  \n\nFilmmakers, if they intend to dive into hell, they accept and embody hell in the film, or they reject it and embody something else that defeats hell, but \"Mother!\" meets unstoppable force with immovable object.  It meets cosmically immutable with ontologically intolerable, and creates a *cataclysmic* level of moral, spiritual, and cognitive dissonance that it doesn't even try to resolve.\n\nThe resulting tension is agonizing and fascinating, and the best I've come up with about it is to wonder about the possibility that it might be a new genre.\n\n",

They flow.\n\nSay what you want about the prequels, honestly all they needed was Spielberg or someone else to tell George “no” (Which he did in 3). Hell Harrison ford had issues with the lines in the OT and he told George “he can write a story but the lines are shit,” (paraphrased). I’m surprised no one told him that in 3.\n\nRegardless \n\nWhen you watch them from 1-6 it flows but when you watch it from 1-8 you’re asking yourself “wtf is going on” at 7-8. It literally a rehash no a lite reboot of the original trilogy. It doesn’t even feel like a continuation of the story, but a lite reboot. They’ve reused most of the trops from 4-6, and i mean heavily reused it...oh wait it’s a salt planet not snow never mind.... but take TLJ it doesn’t feel like a starwars movie but a Marvel movie with a starwars skin. The pacing, the ‘comedy’ that almost breaks the forth wall by completely  disengaging you from the current scene.\n\nNow i will say rogue one doesn’t have these flaws; it feels like a starwars movie, the villains are villains...hux is no tarkin hell hes not even krennic, and vader, man his scenes were gold., not to mention the pacing isn’t all over the place, the comedy makes sense (robot)!and the diversity isn’t forced. Albeit the rebels should have waaaay more aliens and the empire being pro human should have massive ethnic and gender diversity. But that’s besides the point.",

I'd really like to watch more films, and I'm planning on making a project out of it. Specifically, I'm planning on watching one film per day, over the course of a year (at least). I'm doing one genre per month, and I'm starting off with action films! Nothing with science fiction or fantasy (those have their own months), just action (and adventure, possibly). I have two questions, and if I could get some help from you guys, I'd really appreciate it. Those questions/requests are:\n\n* How would you guys actually define an \"action\" film, genre-wise? I'm asking this of you guys personally, but if anyone has any published and/or peer-reviewed sources (like video essays or straight-up written film-essays), I'd really appreciate that as well.\n\n* I'd love some suggestions for action films to watch. I have my own list, but I'd like to corroborate my list with other suggestions, and get a solid list before I start this whole thing. \n\nIf this belongs in the \"Fun and Fancy Free\" section, my apologies. Thought this might be a little too large to fit in a comment in that thread, but please let me know.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "The *Star Wars* series has long been noted for its imagery and themes that evoke classical mythology in scope and references. This was somewhat lost in the prequels, which had plot elements (broken vow of celibacy, etc.) drawn more from telenovelas and soaps - but even that much-maligned portion of the series had references to various periods in history such as the rise of the Borgias, the fall of the Roman Republic, and some profound political commentary about the fragility of democracy.\n\n*Star Wars: The Last Jedi*, however, restores the mystical, mythological, and - moreover- religiously inspired aspects of the series. Luke Skywalker overtly refers to the Jedi beliefs as a \"religion\" and the Caretakers are dressed as nuns. These are some more overt example, but there is one scene in particular that should stick with viewers on this note. Luke is shown attempting to kill Kylo Ren almost as a test, but not without sacrificing his own goodness. He eventually stays his hand, evoking the story of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac (or Ishmael if that's your belief) as a test of his faith in God. So too might Luke's near-sacrifice of Kylo Ren be taken as a test of his faith in The Force, or the \"Jedi Religion,\" which is challenged throughout the narrative of *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*. \n\nThere are some further references here: Canto Bight is reflective of biblical descriptions of Babylon, which from the perspective of the Babylonian Captivity was a city of vice built on slavery. While a more secular interpretation is that the setting provides a commentary on class inequality and exploitation, the slave children are shown at the end entertaining and inspiring themselves with stories of the Jedi religion, and at least one is shown as force-sensitive, implying that, like the Jews under the Babylonian Captivity, their spiritual traditions and the sense of identity it creates builds their hope for liberation.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7mau10/i_was_unimpressed_with_shape_of_waters_trailer/",
        "text": "Shape of Water is a film I did not expect to like very much based off the trailer and the subject matter, but it really grew on me steadily over the two hour runtime and might just be my favorite movie in what has already been an insanely competitive year for film. What convinces me most is that the script is masterfully crafted with rich characters and expertly written set-ups followed by satisfying pay-offs. Thinking back on it, the film ends more or less how one would expect a movie like this to, with basically nothing that would be considered a major twist in anyway, but it all just feels so organic and well thought out that it seems as if Del Toro was born to write it. \n\nIn terms of character, I was most surprised by Michael Shannon. Even for the first chunk of the film or so, I expected him to be just generic bad guy who is simply there to be an obstacle for our story. In many ways, he is that: Shannon’s character is never redeemed or given much of a soft side, but the script takes such care as to really get into the psychology of someone of power who dehumanizes all those around him for a variety of purposes. This is all elevated by his absolutely horrifying performance and the film’s brutality. Along with him, all the other characters are extremely memorable with defined desires, flaws, strengths, and above all personality. Sally Hawkins is so perfectly cast. She’s so beautiful and sensual in this film in such a subdued way and gives such a powerful performance, particularly when she is begging others to literally hear what she is saying through their own words. Her fear of letting go of someone she loves despite the fact it is the very thing that is killing them is relatable, despite the film never really making a big show of it.\n\nAnother nice surprise I did not expect from the script was how intricately plotted some sequences are. This, of course, is best demonstrated in what is the “heist” sequence toward the midpoint.  The successes and mistakes the characters make are so naturally set-up beforehand that I never considered earlier on that they would be used for anything else. Richard Henkins artistic ability being an asset but his self-consciousness about his age almost ruining everything out, Octavia Spencer’s loyalty being both a liability and an unexpected save,  the color and placement of Shannon’s car, the syringe needle. It’s all there before, and extremely satisfying after. The film’s conclusion has very similar payoff as well. \n\nShape of Water also looks fantastic, but the credit probably goes to the rich production design rather than the pretty standard cinematography, save a few great vfx shots. This film proves yet again the Guillermo Del Toro really has an eye for architecture when it comes to his sets. The apartments and the laboratory where the Amphibian Man is held are much more interesting than these sets would look in his peer’s films. Where many of his sci-fi contemporaries would fall for the temptation of going big and trying to impress you with scale and clutter, Del Toro goes for something that feels more real while somehow not sacrificing what makes it uniquely his. Any shots that take place underwater is absolutely breathtaking, and the design of the Amphibian Man really rides the line and makes the audience question if such a thing can truly be loved. \n\nWhat really pushes Shape of Water from being a well made film to something truly special are in the ways it challenges the audience. There’s no doubt that many people will struggle with the general concept of cross-species love, and will be made uncomfortable by some of the more intimate scenes toward the end of the film, but it presents them so matter-of-factly in a narrative similar to what we’ve seen countless times that it will force viewers to question that discomfort and evaluate their outlook. By the end of Shape of Water, the journey of perspective of the Amphibian Man is realized, the audience mirroring many characters of the film who, too, initially did not understand. The film is also shockingly brutal and violent, and will be difficult for some audience members. Initially I was torn on the purpose of this, thinking it may have been a cheap trick to get an emotional response, but it serves the purpose of being so engaging and surprising that it distracts from what otherwise may have been a really predictable end.\n\nI really have no gripes with the film either, other than maybe it’s aforementioned predictability. I could basically praise everything about the film. I can’t remember the last time a film made me evaluate my biases in this way. I can’t remember the last time a film so dramatically changed how I felt about it from the beginning to the end. I’m not usually a huge proprietor of his work, but I truly feel that Guillermo Del Toro has crafted something really special that feels so true to him. The more I think about this film, the more I discover the small details and victories that are carefully woven throughout. Shape of Water is so uniquely beautiful, both terrifying and heartwarming. Both fantastical and real.          \n",

        "text": "In 2006, Kehr wrote a (terribly titled) column for *Slate* which eulogized the oft derided latter stages of a directors' careers. I found it quite interesting.\n***\n\n[\"The Viagra Auteurs: In Defense of Old Movie Directors\"](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/summer_movies/2006/06/the_viagra_auteurs.html)\n--\n\n- **Despite film supposedly being \"a young persons' medium,\" Kehr highly regards what the more venerable can contribute:**\n\n&gt;*Many film buffs have a special affection for the late works of the masters, even when those films—like Hawks' RIO LOBO (1970) or Ford's 7 WOMEN (1966)—lack the obvious appeal of their midcareer work. These wintry films often have a stark, pared-down quality, a sense of cutting to the essence, that can be tremendously moving—at the same time, they seem a bit sketchy and remote. The glow of seeing Carl Theodor Dreyer's startlingly direct GERTRUDE, made in 1964 when the great Danish director was 75, temporarily makes all other movies look sentimental and overfurnished. The final film of the great French director Jean Renoir, who died in 1979 at the age of 84, functions almost literally as a last will and testament.*\n\n- **A key sentence which explains why he finds those films so appealing:**\n\n&gt;*For the most part, these filmmakers are doing what they've always done, but infused with more of a calm and contemplative quality.*\n\n- **However, (in the US, at least) the opportunity for filmmakers to make these later-career classics has shrunk with changes in Hollywood industry:**\n\n&gt;*The bad news about [A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION (Robert Altman)], 16 BLOCKS [Richard Donner], and FIND ME GUILTY [Sidney Lumet] is that all three films come from outside the studio system.*\n\n&gt;*...*\n\n&gt;*Eastwood, Altman, and Lumet have been around long enough to acquire a certain mythic status, but the situation is graver for the generation of filmmakers who came after them. Directors like Walter Hill (THE WARRIORS), Joe Dante (GREMLINS), and John Milius (CONAN THE BARBARIAN), who came of age in the '70s and '80s, have been finding it almost impossible to land studio projects.*\n\n- **On why that it is worrying and perhaps why that has been happening:**\n\n&gt;*These are not doddering codgers, but individuals in late middle age who would still have been working regularly under the regimes of the old moguls, who knew the value (economic and artistic) of experience. The new MBA masters of Hollywood push seasoned (and proportionately expensive and hard to handle) talents aside in favor of inexpensive and pliable young filmmakers straight from Sundance or the film schools.*\n\n***\n\nI figured I'd just toss out some questions to hopefully kickstart some discussion in addition to talking about the article itself. Obviously, I don't necessarily want specific answers to every question, I'd just love to hear what others have to say on the topic.\n\n1. **Do you agree with Kehr that (in a somewhat ideal world), we should pay extra-attention to the latter-years works of directors?**\n\n2. **What changes in a directors stylistics have you noticed as they age—either collectively or specifically?**\n\n3. **What benefits are there to a director being older?**\n\n4. **What drawbacks are there to a director being older?**\n\n5. **What are your favorite later career outputs from a director(s)?**\n\n6. **What are your least favortie later career outputs from a director(s)?**\n\n8. **Any other observations on the topic?**",

Look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSonz-GfgHs&amp;t=608s) and notice that as much as critics are more inclined to provide better reviews, even critics can make mistakes or make the wrong reviews\n\nOr what about the fans' perspective? Is everyone simply a movie critic now? Well, yes ... kinda. Like I said, everyone can simply interpret what they see in their own manner and of course, needless to say none of those opinions are either right or wrong. You may not like Star Wars because everyone likes them which makes sense because maybe you do not like to follow the bandwagon. Maybe you do not like Star Wars because you may find it too cheesy or maybe you just do not like all the marketing that is put in Star Wars like all the toys and other products related to Star Wars that are being produced. \n\nWhat about fans who are in love of Star Wars like having seen the films and read the books and understand the lore through and through? Maybe that is why there are fans out there who hate this film because [this video says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNoMQSvNAWE) they see it as too inconsistent with most of the lore of the Star Wars franchise and maybe too many things are put into the film just to make money *(like for example, the Porgs may simply be there just to look cute so that people will buy cute Porg toys to their friends or partners as a gift because they love Star Wars, or maybe the pink haired character is there for the whole feminist type of agenda that Disney wants to push because it may appeal the female demographic of the Star Wars audience and may more likely make them want to see future Star Wars films)*\n\nThen again, maybe people are just simply too fed up of certain features in the film that are there just to make money because after all, that is what a business does like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_FYGA-l8b8) briefly mentioned that film making goes through a lot of process of how it made to make the most money possible.\n\nWhy people are divided about Star Wars well I am not sure. I am no art student or a film maker or a critic. Maybe it is a mixture of poor film making or poor prioritisation on what the film is meant to appeal or perhaps even that there were prioritisation on other things to make more money even if certain things had to be sacrificed or replaced like for example [Mark Hamill himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0biqMZrxJ0) does not like The Last Jedi. He sees that his character is too off-character and feels that this was produced in a manner to sell more rather than staying true to what the lore is meant to be portrayed. It is kind of funny how this movie was hyped to be the next big thing but one of the main cast was against it and there was little posts about it *(or maybe it was not shared as much because many people were hyped about the next Star Wars film and we only are able to agree with Mark Hamill now because after seeing the film, some people feel the same way)*",
