Water dissolves the antigen, overcomes the barrier of skin and the antigen forces cells to release histamine. In severe cases, the skin (epithelial tissue) of the throat, mouth, and internals reacts to water. Water of any purity or temperature causes the reaction. Drinking water can cause anaphylaxis in severe cases. They usually have to survive by drinking less watery fluids, such as milk. It seems like the other components in milk prevent the water molecules from dissolving the epithelial (skin) antigen.",

I know I want to go to grad school and after that hopefully into a career in drug design/development or teaching pre-clinical classes at a med school. My main interests are in the human body and the physiology behind it. I have always asked questions like why does acetaminophen reduce your fever, or why can chest pain be a sign of anything from a heart attack to indigestion. However the question I have is what to go to grad school for to achieve these goals? It seems like a chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, immunology, pharmacology, molecular and cell biology, etc. masters or PhD could all achieve a job in these fields. How should I go about narrowing down the grad school choice based on my own interests?",

I've had several surgeries but nothing helped, I have multiple co morbidities including heart problems because of the EDS. I just keep getting worse and I'm on so many medications I lose count.\n\nI've read about cancer, diabetes, blindness, and allergies being cured through the placebo effect, so why not genetic diseases?\n\nA terminally ill man with cancer was cured via the placebo effect. He was given sugar pills, but was told by scientists that they were anti cancer breakthrough pills. His tumor actually disappeared. In another study, patients with severe, life threatening allergies to nuts were hypnotized into believing they were not allergic. They were then given a powder which contained nuts. None of them had an allergic reaction, simply because they believed they were not allergic.\n\nI don't understand why the placebo effect isn't used to cure people. It's amazing what the brain can do. If believing you're not allergic can re wire your immune system, and believing you've taken an anti-cancer pill causes cancer cells to selectively die off, why can't it make EDS mutations vanish because a person believed they would?\n\nThe more I learn about the human brain, the more convinced I am that it's bordering on supernatural. It's stupid that more people aren't talking about this!\n\nEven without removing the gene defect, couldn't the placebo effect also convince the body to produce normal collagen, rather than defective EDS collagen?\n\nWouldn't it be much cheaper for scientists/doctors to just lie and say that a pill alters DNA when really it's just sugar? Wouldn't it save costs of having to research and develop complicated compounds?\n\nIf believing you will be cured actually cures you of a physical disease, why aren't scientists exploiting the hell out of that?",

        "text": "I am wondering about the  role that visual and external stimuli play on activating FSH, LH, GnRH  axis and other hormonal axis'. I worked in a prison and the physical  changes I saw in men was really really extreme, while it may just be an  anecdote I saw many men go from being obese and overweight to becoming  incredibly physically fit with very strong muscle definition as well as  an improvement in their health.. (triglyceride levels, HDL/LDL ratio  etc. were improved during their time in prison)\n\nI  suspect that the opposite would happen. That the stress/cortisol would  cause more metabolic dis-regulation ( ultimately more cholesterol as  glucogenic pathways are driven up) and less muscle definition or growth  as amino acids are utilized for gluconeogenesis and ketone body  synthesis rather than protein synthesis, and etc.\n\nI  do not believe that it is because they \"work out all day\" as there  comes a point when the breakdown of muscle exceeds the repair capacity  and you end up weaker.\n\nI strongly  suspect this is an evolutionary adaptation that acts upon GnRH hormonal  axis' and leads to more testosterone synthesis as a response to a  dangerous environment, but i never worked out the details or did an  investigation.",

I've had several surgeries but nothing helped, I have multiple co morbidities including heart problems because of the EDS. I just keep getting worse and I'm on so many medications I lose count.\n\nI've read about cancer, diabetes, blindness, and allergies being cured through the placebo effect, so why not genetic diseases?\n\nA terminally ill man with cancer was cured via the placebo effect. He was given sugar pills, but was told by scientists that they were anti cancer breakthrough pills. His tumor actually disappeared. In another study, patients with severe, life threatening allergies to nuts were hypnotized into believing they were not allergic. They were then given a powder which contained nuts. None of them had an allergic reaction, simply because they believed they were not allergic.\n\nI don't understand why the placebo effect isn't used to cure people. It's amazing what the brain can do. If believing you're not allergic can re wire your immune system, and believing you've taken an anti-cancer pill causes cancer cells to selectively die off, why can't it make EDS mutations vanish because a person believed they would?\n\nThe more I learn about the human brain, the more convinced I am that it's bordering on supernatural. It's stupid that more people aren't talking about this!\n\nedit: Even without removing the gene defect, couldn't the placebo effect also convince the body to produce normal collagen, rather than defective EDS collagen?",
