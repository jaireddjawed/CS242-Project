We are not given any insight into the headspace of the character, nor any other described character.\n\nAll of that seems to lead towards a third-person objective framing –\n\n– except for one line, about halfway down:\n\n&gt;I saw him rack up thirty-eight or forty in one home game. His hands were like wild birds.\n\nThis is the only time the narrator references his own self.\n\nSo, given this self-reference... does this now make the poem first-person perspective?  Or does it remain third-person, as the narrator is never fleshed out as a true character aside from this break?\n\nFurther, if the poem were absent said stanza, would it now be considered third person objective?  Or would the clear bias of the narrator, in and of itself, give character to the narrator – even absent any clear self-reference?\n\nWould love some insight...",

Now, in this [answer](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/YouCouldLookItUp/faq0032.html/) to a question about whether to use *OK* or *okay*, the word *okeydoke* is present near the very bottom. Now, *CMOS* likes to use the first form of a word in almost every case so as to be consistent, but this is a variant of *okey dokey* that’s *way* down the list, which strikes me as a bit odd. I then checked out the thesaurus definition, and—lo and behold—*okeydoke* is the preferred term. First, it seems odd that there are two separate preferred terms for the dictionary and thesaurus versions of Merriam-Webster. Second, it appears to be a discrepancy on *CMOS*’s part since they prefer the first form of the *dictionary* version of a word, not the thesaurus one. I would really appreciate it if you guys would help me out.",

This shit makes your life easier. But I did not use all grammar suggestions, some were just plain stupid suggestions. I am the master of my own words still.\n\nWhat I love here most is the suggestions in synonyms. My vocabulary is not that wide, so sometimes, just to avoid repetitive words, I would do my best to search for the synonym on the internet. Now, I might not have to do that all the time. \n\nSince this is my first time using Grammarly, I just want to know other people's experiences who have been using this. I’m just wondering if this would slow me down from learning English. Because I have been practicing it manually ever since, and that helped me a lot to learn from my own mistakes.

        "text": "(I hope this is a relevant subreddit... this might be more of a word definition question than grammar, but AskLinguistics took my post down and not sure where else to ask)\n\nMy friend and I were discussing the idea of a 'diseased corpse' from a video game, and he thought that only living things could be diseased. The dictionary definition for disease is\n\n&gt; a condition of the living animal or plant body or of one of its parts that impairs normal functionin\n\nor\n\n&gt; a disordered or incorrectly functioning organ, part, structure, or system of the body resulting from the effect of genetic or developmental errors, infection, poisons, nutritional deficiency or imbalance, toxicity, or unfavorable environmental factors; illness; sickness; ailment\n\nThese seem to imply only living things can be diseased. So if a corpse is no longer living, can it technically be diseased? Does the 'disease' refer to the condition of the living thing (as in the definition), or does it refer to the group of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites, as in 'infectious diseases'? You hear people say that something \"carries disease\". So maybe a corpse can carry disease, but can a corpse BE diseased? We both agreed that it sounds weird to describe something completely inanimate as diseased, like if there was deadly bacteria on the floor it doesn't sound right to say 'the floor is diseased'. What about decomposed dead moldy food, can you have 'diseased fruit'?\n\nBasically, is it more accurate to say that a corpse can spread or cause disease, but you wouldn't say the corpse is diseased itself? Or can a corpse be accurately described as diseased, maybe by some other definition or usage we're missing?",

After all, \"Sold\" suggests that he just sold all the fish.   \n\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",
