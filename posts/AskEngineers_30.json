There's a hole in the floor of the garage to allow you to easily lower material/tools into the basement. It's currently in a pretty sketchy, rusty state and I'm looking to replace it. \n\nThis hole is in a place in the garage where a car would ideally be parked. I'm wondering if there's any thickness of sheet metal I could buy to simply lay overtop of the hole that would support the weight of one of my car's wheels. \n\nThe hole is 42\"x38\", with a 1.25\" recessed lip (ie, the actual dimensions of the hole excluding the lip are 39.5\"x35.5\"). Ideally this piece of metal would be recessed onto the lip, but I would sacrifice that if it means being able to park a car on it (or if it was cheaper). \n\nHere are some pictures of the hatch as it stands:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/kHRlLTw](https://imgur.com/a/kHRlLTw)",

        "text": "I work for a pretty young company with a lot of great designers/engineers, but we‚Äôre a small team and are still working to create our standard OEM assembly‚Äôs. \n\nI‚Äôm trying to settle a dispute with an engineer and sales manager about a design we employed recently. I‚Äôm pretty confident my engineers are being lazy and my lack of title is making me fall on deaf ears (Non-degreed ‚Äúsales engineer‚Äù)\n\nI worked as an industrial tech for around 5 years. In that time, I replaced countless bearings, shafts and housings. It was always a good excuse to get out the big hammer. \n\nWhat was instilled upon me was; your inner and outer race MUST be secured to the shaft and housing. Whether this is a pillow block style bearing or a press fit housing, or even a punch damaging the housing enough for an emergency fix, the principal remained the same. I remember us having a housing redone and polished just be sure the fit was secure, as an unfinished fit allows loosening. \n\nWe made a design for the outer race that is 2 parts which bolt together to compress the outer race. I sent a video of this not being done property because with the bolts tight, the bearing wiggles freely. \n\nI was told this wasn‚Äôt a problem. \n\nI followed up with saying that we should be using bearing retainer on the inner race+shaft and that the outer must be secured in my experience. \n\nThis is a small conveyor that will be belt driven. \n\nI was told ‚ÄúThe tension on the belt holds the outer race against the housing and keeps it from spinning.‚Äú\n\nThis is incorrect, right? This would exert loads on the bearing (possibly minor?) in directions they‚Äôre not designed for, in addition to simply going against design principles. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt a hill I want to die on - but I also don‚Äôt want to watch us ship 50 of these like this. \n\nThoughts? Advice?",

My concept will involve a process where the person removes that top portion of the can by pulling a lever of sorts and allow the content to freely flow out until the can is empty. My question is, can this be done in a safe manner in a can that has high pressure gas inside it, e.g a spray canister? are there risks, such as the can exploding? I don't plan on changing the rate of gas freely leaving the canister but rather just allow it to freely escape until it is empty. I hope I explained it clearly. Thank you in advance",

I have a few questions about the efficiency:\n\n1. As far as I can tell, all the way down to 0F (-18c) the heat pump is more cost effective than my backup natural gas furnace (80% efficient).  Does that sound right?  I based this off $0.14/KWh electricity and $1.71/therm prices and an estimated coefficient of performance between 2 and 2.2 at 0F (seemed to be the best estimate I could find googling since my particular heat pump's manual doesn't give COP as a function of temeprature).  With these numbers, at 0F I get $0.063/KWh of heat from the heat pump and $0.075/KWh of heat from the furnace.  The house starts getting cold at around 15C outside but I am thinking that may be due to the size of the system compared to the insulation more than the overall efficiency?\n\n2. How much does airflow obstruction affect the efficiency of a heat pump? For example closing vents in one room of the house or if snow has accumulated on the heat exchange cabinet outside.  Is it worth the time to shovel snow off of the outdoor unit?\n\n3. Is there a way to estimate the COP while the unit is running?  I was thinking about a ridiculously over-engineered method where I measure the temperature and flow rate from the furnace as well as using a clamp on amp meter to estimate the energy usage of the compressor.  But is there an easier way?\n\nThanks!",

Now why does this same thing not occur with some rocket engines in particular the Space X Falcon 9 rocket, as it climbs in altitude and the air temp surrounding it decreases, shouldn't a contrail form because it's burning a fuel + oxidizer combo? If you look at launches such as the Saturn V and others you can see the contrail form. Could anyone explain this to me? I really struggle to find a clear explanation online anywhere.",

We're indoctrinated to believe \"cars bad\" and we should build communities for people, not automobiles. I support this ethos, for the most part. However, something I can't wrap my head around is why we intentionally hamstring the flow of traffic by building curbed and landscaped medians. \n\nIn the Portland, Oregon Metro, we often see things like this:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/KVIf5LV](https://imgur.com/a/KVIf5LV)\n\nThey are an intentional design decision and they are everywhere, especially in the suburbs, who are more car friendly than the central city. And although I get that it definitely makes things look nicer, probably helps with rainwater perc, etc., they just absolutely cripple the area in terms of traffic flow during busy times. \n\nCars line up to turn left but they back up so far that the lines extends into the through-lane. When the through lane turns green, people can't go because of the backed up cars in the left turn lane. Cars in backed up through-lane try to get over and hinder the through traffic of the right side through lane. And the example image I posted above is a screen grab of a just recently expanded roadway (added an additional land in each direction). The clearly knew the numbers before the rebuild. \n\nThe engineers know this continues to happen all over the place. Surely the engineers also drive around our communities and see this happening everywhere. So, I just can't wrap my head around why engineers would do this intentionally. There has to be a good reason I'm not seeing.",

        "text": "I am currently working on a series of science fiction novel [over on Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/TacitusKadari) and in the setting, I wanted one of the factions to have distinct fighter jets with forward swept wings. A [video from Real Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN6vGxyMcVU) got me enthusiastic about the concept. I thought with how unstable these designs are, I could use them to make extremely maneuverable (probably also hard to fly) planes that aren't necessarily teh fastest, but can still pull of crazy maneuvers even when fitted with heavy equipment that would make other planes fly like bricks. So I basically thoight of them as dedicated e-warfare planes that can defend themselves against interceptors or multi role fighters.\n\nHowever, then I watched [the follow up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NsYyAUOHE) and problems started to emerge. The way I understand it, a fighter jet becomes too unstable when returning to level flight costs you lots of kinetic energy. \n\nThat's not a problem for one of the fighter jets I made up. That thing is a ridiculously fast, even capable of going hypersonic for a short time, and ludicrously expensive high tech jet, it would still be a mach number faster than everyone else if it loses lots of speed going back to level flight. But these planes are so few in number, they're more propaganda tools than anything else.\n\nSo what is a solution I could add in for (higher end) workhorse fighter jets that have forward swept wings? Since this is a sci-fi setting, it doesn't need to be technologically feasible today or even by the end of this century, just a somewhat realistic idea. I can hand wave quite a bit, but I want to keep the technology as grounded as possible.\n\nStealth is not an issue, sine that has become entirely the doman of electronic warfare in the setting I'm writing. The only reason I did that is because I wanted some visual variety among my planes. Modern stealth designs tend to look kinda samey imo.",

I haven't taken any calculus lessons because as I said I am focusing on my national exams right now. I also ordered an Arduino Uno and I am waiting for that to arrive. and so here is my question: how do I design stuff, I've watched a lot of videos of people explaining how to get started but they all say the same thing, that you need math, physics, programming, and software like CAD and stuff, but like how do I use these things to build projects. I want to touch some physical components, build stuff to get experience, or just build stuff just for the sake of building stuff. that is why I wanna be an engineer I like making stuff. I tried fixing a lock on the door, but my design didn't work. that's what I wanna learn how do I design and make stuff? I am gonna be making some stuff after I get an Arduino but I wanna build some stuff without it as well or even after I get an Arduino, there's all the other stuff too like motors and batteries and stuff, how do I know how they work? or how do I know what things I need to buy for a project?

        "text": "General question: Is cutting power off to hardware not in use somehow bad? Are electronics built with vampire power in mind?\n\n---\n\nMore specifically for PC hardware:\n\n\nWhen your system powers off, are the capacitors on the CPU depleting to empty? Curious if there's any reason a power supply might benefit from vampire power (i.e. consuming power without the device doing anything beneficial). I measured all the hardware connected to my surge protector and they add up to ~40W of vampire power consumed (i.e. when all the devices are off). My low-power i3-12100 server system somehow consumes 3W when off which is a little more than expected consider I turned features like Wake on LAN off so the PC is not waiting for any signal. I have a smart plug and am thinking of using this on the power strip (obviously the sum of the loads is reasonably under the rated load of the smart plug and I've been doing that a few days without issues). I don't want to somehow damage my PSU by cutting power to it when if it expects vampire power. \n\nIn general, I'm wondering if it's somehow bad to cut power off to electronics every time they are not in use. I assume not, hence why you always see the recommendations for AC adapters to unplug them when they are not in use for a long period of time. The only possible reason I can think of is whether vampire power keeps the circuitry warm so there is less of a temp difference between the hardware on vs. off; however, it is doubtful that vampire level of consumption generates enough heat to make a difference.\n\nI'm not looking for answers like  \"it's not worth it\" or \"you're not saving much on the power bill\"--which is not meaningful. With a smart plug to schedule to turn things off when I'm asleep or at work the inconvenience factor is zero. In the worse case scenario I simply toggle the smart plug on within an arm's reach next to my PC, something I do when I need to turn on the computer anyway.",

I am building my second ROV (underwater drone), and I want to add 3  components that were missing in the previous version - water pressure  sensor (to measure depth real-time), electronic compass module (to get  bearings underwater), and a mic (to try and record some interesting  sounds). Now, there are plenty of components for this task, and I did my  research, but there are several requirements that make this a bit  difficult:\n\n1. Components must work underwater at pressures up to 10 bar.\n2. They  must have as few wires as possible, because I will have to pass each  wire through a watertight bulkhead, which is difficult to do.\n3. They must be able to interface with Raspberry Pi (the controller inside this ROV).\n4. They must be as compact as possible - my ROV is very small (250x300x210 mm).\n5. Components  preferably sourced from Aliexpress/Ebay, since other sellers usually  have insanely expensive shipping to my country (Lithuania).\n\nTo be more specific about each component:\n\n1. I  can't seem to be able to find digital water pressure sensor modules at  all that can make measurements up to 10 bar and can work with Rpi. There  are plenty of air pressure sensors, and some of them are able to work  up to 10 bar, so I am thinking if I can make a sort of a \"moonpool\" for  that sensor, so the water never touches it, but the air pressure is  affected by water pressure. It is still dangerous if the ROV flips.  Perhaps I can make some sort of a tunnel with many bends to make sure  water can't get it at any orientation, but I'd rather use a proper  module to begin with. Another issue is that a lot of these sensors are  differential sensors, meaning they require a non-pressurized medium as  reference. I don't have that underwater, since the whole sensor will be  submerged.\n2. I  have several compass modules that are designed to work with Arduino/Rpi  (such as GY-273), but they seem to be extremely sensitive to  electromagnetic fields created by the BLDC motors of the ROV, as well as  other electronics. I tried placing the compass module as far away from  the motors as possible, but it still goes crazy. I am not even sure, if  it is possible to solve this?\n3. Underwater microphone - can't find anything at all.\n\nCan  anyone suggest anything? I know there are several guys here who are  working with ROVs, so maybe you could share your experiences?",
