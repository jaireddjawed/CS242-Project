But decades later while I was working in Britain, I was taken aback to see that the rebellious behavior leading to my deferral remained in a my French personnel file. I needed it to be updated before I could return home to France to work after ten years and the only way to clear my dossier was to be re-evaluated and join the French military. In a surreal series of events, I found the French, British, and Israeli Secret Services were all interested in me. In the end, I decided to serve in the medical corps of the French army as a way to settle my debts with the military. So, In my mid-fifties, I became a liaison emergency doctor in war-torn Afghanistan.\n\nMy memoir offers a unique perspective on the conflict in Afghanistan, how war is waged and about the medical challenges presented by the expansion of terrorism into Europe and the United States.\n\nAmerican author Jessica Levine translated my memoir into English from the French version will also be joining the conversation.\n\nYou can visit me at www.eliepaulcohen.com.\n\nProof:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/c30r6tq6iak11.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7mmvnpczhak11.jpg",

I am a US Submarine Veteran and the founder of r/Submarines. I am bringing you an expert panel of submariners, explorers, historians, authors, researchers, pod-casters and the US submarine rescue \"Falcon-1\" ROV pilot. Helping me with this AMA is /u/KapitanKurt (moderator of r/Submarines and r/WarshipPorn).  \n   \nThe submarine world is one of the most unseen, unforgiving, classified, ground breaking and tight knit communities on the planet. We discover new life on almost every dedicated dive, explore the most dangerous places on Earth and even research the origin of life. Some of us live a life (akin to high security prisoners) hundreds of feet underwater, loaded with more firepower than all the WWII explosives combined, powered by a fission reactor, tasked with deterring species ending war... all while being endlessly hunted like an underwater trophy kill.   \n  \nA vast majority of the submarine culture nurtures mis/disinformation. All aspects of the military and civilian culture have their own secrets. This AMA is dedicated to providing a means to ask questions in a manner that is safe and comfortable for all parties.  \n  \nOperational security (OPSEC) is going to be maintained at the highest level to ensure the safety of everyone involved. **Questions involving classified information will not be answered.** I apologize before hand if your question doesn't get answered. Simple questions like \"How deep can you dive?\" or \"How fast can you go underwater?\" are usually classified. We get questioned about classified material all the time so don't hesitate to ask us anything. Everyone cleared to work with classified information is trained on how to deal with questions.  The panel will answer questions as they see fit and follow any procedures required of them.     \n    \n###Introduction:   \n+ /u/SubAMA - David Ayer - US Veteran Sonar Tech on USS Haddo - Screen writer for U-571 - Director, Writer, Producer....

They also keep up with the latest in submarine news and interview people from the community.  \n  \nEveryone on the panel has been instructed to hold of on answering any questions until 12p EST to allow the up/down votes to filter questions.   \n  \nThis AMA is going to stay at 100% active until tomorrow due to the time differences. Everyone involved is scattered across 6 different time zones. The active submariners have unreliable schedules due to the nature of the job. We also have a few people taking business flights today. Some replys maybe delayed due to this. I will keep everyone up to date if I am informed of any delays.  \n     \n###Proof - https://imgur.com/gallery/PHxZQMy - https://imgur.com/a/kfHpTnK\n###Additional Proof - https://imgur.com/a/sguE54T - https://redd.it/9cnzuj\n\n \n",

        "text": "https://i.imgur.com/RhnM4vL.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/m6pZYEs.jpg\n\nMy name is Corina and I love boxing, traveling, cooking, my husband Bob and our dog, Ernie. I’ve lived in Philly for almost two decades after moving to the US from Venezuela. It’s been a good life and only in recent years have things changed drastically on my end.\n \nIn 2011, I came down with an awful sinus infection. That’s all I thought it was. The doctors couldn’t figure out why my blood pressure was through the roof or what was going on. Turns out, I had something called IGA nephropathy. I was 27 years old.\n \nBeing diagnosed with chronic kidney disease—that rapidly progressed—wasn’t a life sentence for me. I refused to let it hold me back or get me down. I found ways to stay active, to stay positive, and to stay… myself. I didn’t want to lose a sense of myself through this diagnosis. The specialists said it could take 20 years until my kidneys would stop working. It only took 5.\n \nMy name is Corina, and I used to love boxing. I used to love traveling. I used to have more energy for everyday things. My husband Bob and our dog Ernie make every day a little bit easier, when I can stay awake long enough to spend time with them. Doing anything in Philly—no matter the season—is exhausting. Walking is exhausting. Talking is exhausting. Putting all of this on paper is exhausting… and terrifying, yet here I am.\n \nMy name is Corina, I’m 34 years old, and I need a new kidney.\n\nMy blood type is O (as in S.O.S. or O.M.G. or “O, wow that’s the universal donor blood type, so O donors are in high demand”) so that’s where things get a little trickier. \n\nRight now, my life isn’t the same as it used to be, and I don’t feel the same, either. But I’m still me. Still Corina. And I’m still hopeful. And I’m still patient. And a patient, too—here at Jefferson University Hospital in Philly, in case you’re local to the area.\n \nTo contact me directly about anything you’ve read here, please email [findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com](findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com) anytime.  \n \nCorina\n\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI am truly shocked by the amount of responses I have gotten so far. Not only am I hearing from people with the same disease as mine but also people who know someone that has it and is curious to learn more. This is truly amazing!\n\nNot only are people just generally sending positive vibes, but they're offering to get tested to donate also. I'm incredibly grateful. **If you asked me to send you a donor form in the comments, could you please email me at [findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com](findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com). It's getting hard to keep track of everyone on here! (which I guess is not a bad thing!)**\n\nTo all of you with IGA Nephropathy, kidney disease or other chronic illness, I'm happy to have helped you in any way, however small. And it makes me feel a little less alone hearing a lot of you who've gone through the same and have come out the other side feeling better!\n\nLastly, I will try my hardest to reply to every single one of your questions. I do need to get back to work today though! So I will chip away at this every night this week. \n\n\n**EDIT #2**\n\nI think I was able to get to all of your questions and comments tonight! \n\nAgain, thanks to everyone for your questions, words of support and over all positivity. I saw some really great questions and interactions, and as a newbie on Reddit it was nice to see such a huge community of people ask and answer so many questions related to IgaN, kidney disease, transplant and other chronic illness. \n\nTo all of you who offered to help. You are amazing humans. I cannot believe how many people are willing to help a stranger. I am shocked and incredibly grateful. ",
