I want to use it with my computere connected to midi controllers and one audio interface for a microphone and one instrument.  \nI was thinking in something like the roland street cube EX or maybe Bose S1 Pro but i don't know how much im sacrificing by choosing a single speaker instead of a couple.  \ni like the idea of beign able to use it also for playing music via bluetooth for medium size partys but my main interest is beign able to play in different places in exterior at a good volume.  \nI want something portable but i don't know what is the best investment. Maybe i can buy a couple of big homestudio speakers and use them in my house too. My idea is getting a powerbank to play anywhere like if i was in my studio or at least partially, i use a mini pc and i can use a tablet as screen.  \nI want to go to produce in natural places and also beign able to play in places like parks, bars or the street.  \nWhat do you think?  \nRight now i use 6 passive speakers in my house and it's enough for my room but i know i need something different for what i want.\n\nCan i use the XLR ports of speakers like the roland or the Bose and at the same time the ones in my audio interface so i have more channels?\n\nMaybe someone can help me giving me some guidance.",
