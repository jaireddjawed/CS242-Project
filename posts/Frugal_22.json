        "text": "In the summer of 2020, we bought a used Mazda CX-5 with 93k miles for $10k. It now has 116k miles on it. \n\nLast year (2022) it needed a few unusual repairs, like parts of the undercarriage replaced. The Mazda dealer quoted a fairly high price, and my local auto mechanic did it for about half that amount. Since then, we’ve gone to the same mechanic. We needed new tires and brake pads, as well as routine stuff like oil changes and inspections. The total repair and maintenance cost for the calendar year came to $3686. \n\nLast week, the check engine light came on, and it ended up that our exhaust pipe was cracked in multiple places. The mechanic claimed to save us on parts by leaving existing converters in place and just welding in new pieces of pipe, but the repair still cost $1584. \n\nAdditional info: we live in Boston, which is both an expensive COL city and a tough climate on cars. I drive it on short trips (5mi or less) a few times a week, and longer ones maybe every other weekend. Still, this seems like far more than anything I’ve read about what car maintenance should cost, adjusting for those factors. Am I being conned by my mechanic? Or just unlucky with the amount of repair needed? \n\n(note: I do not think I am being conned by my mechanic. He always shows the issue clearly, eg in the case of the exhaust pipe he brought me under the car and showed me where the leaks were and the sensor they were tripping.)",

        "text": "I am embarking on a seven day work week between two jobs. I have one good full time job that keeps me active, 40-42 hours a week with great benefits. The second job is pizza delivery, working two maybe three days a week, preferably on my days off. My goal here is to ensure I get 8 hours of sleep every night. Some nights I won’t, but 6 out of 7 will be alright. \n\nI picked the pizza job as a second job because I can listen to music &amp; podcasts in the car, it’s easy, and being around the younger crowd is a nice energy to be around. And if there is too much BS, I won’t feel guilty quitting. \n\nI consolidated some debt again, while throwing away $800 long term, the short term gain will be having more than $100 extra each month, keeping me from having to be in more debt from the unexpected.\n\nWhat are some tips to those who have done the seven day work week? I plan to do this for one year. I’m actually excited because I don’t get out otherwise.",

This will last me about 6 months.\n\nI bought the printer (ender 3v2) for 200 dollars.\n\nAs for other costs: the printer does use quite a lot of power during printing (350W) and printing times are long. Think 5 hours for something the size of a cup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I've saved about 300 dollars in the last 1.5 years - which was my initial investment.",

I thought I’d give you an update!\n\nSo the first few times I tried it, it seemed like I still definitely had a “body” smell. I couldn’t tell if it was a stinky body smell or just a human smell though because my sense of smell has been off since I had COVID, so cue the paranoia. Husband’s sense of smell is also off, and my middle schooler doesn’t notice BO.\n\nTwo days ago I diluted a couple of drops of orange essential oil in jojoba oil and rubbed that on after the deodorant stone, and now I can confidently tell you that I don’t stink. I love it! Thank you to those who encouraged me to give it a fair shot, and to the one who mentioned tea tree oil, which was the impetus to try essential oils. I only did orange oil instead because I don’t personally like the smell of tea tree, but orange also has antibacterial properties.",

I bought 2 for me and my wife, made a reservation that same day and we really enjoyed it.  We gave them the groupon at the end of the service and tipped based on the full value of the service (not the Groupon discounted value)  \n\nWe have family coming into town and this would be a great place to bring them - I already made the reservation.  So my wife had the idea to buy more Groupon deals.  She bought the max of 3 as did my two daughters and I bought my last 1.  So now we have 10 Groupons for this restaurant.    6 will be used when the family comes into town and then the other 4 for hanging with my wife, friends and family. I told all my friends, family and the wife’s friends about the deal and the special extra 20% and they all picked up 3 for one date night and one hanging with the friends.  \n\nI feel hella guilty about this because I know groupon takes about half that.  But then at the same time we are not doing anything they don’t allow.  I mean they are for sale and they have a max of 3 per person.

Instead of texting the landlord that, I lied and texted him that I might have to break the lease because my mom was gonna help with my rent but we had a fight and now she won't.  (I know--I'm pathetic) he didn't respond so I panicked and texted that my brother is going to help me (another lie--I know I'm an idiot).  Has anyone been in a situation where they had to break a lease before they moved in--anything similar?  I signed the lease but I don't have a copy yet so I can't even refer to it!

It's also \"cost effective\" which adds to why you should use it - and that's what I'm confused about\n\nFor the accessible option (local supermarket):\n\n* Bleach - $2 for 2L, so $1/L\n* Hydrogen peroxide 3% - $4 for 200ml, so $20.50/L\n\nFor the cheaper hydrogen peroxide option, order online for a 4 litre bottle for $60, so $15/L. And that seems like a waste of money since H2O2 isn't effective 6 months after opening the bottle and I doubt I could go through 4L in 6 months\n\nSo with the cost of hydrogen peroxide being significantly more expensive than bleach, is it still a better option to use H2O2 for household cleaning?",
