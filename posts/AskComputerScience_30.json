        "text": "I am reading an article on conjunctive and boolean grammars and I came across a definition of a grammar as a system of equations. I understand the idea of the definition, but I do not understand the definition for the solution. It is stated that a vector of languages is the solution of the system, a function φ is described as φ : (2^(Σ*))^(|N|)→ (2^(Σ*))^(|N|) which applies the right hand side of the system as a vector function. I don't really understand where the 2^(Σ*) comes from, and how I would \"apply the right hand side\". The article listed as a source of this definition is behind a paywall unfortunately. The least solution is then defined as ∐*_(k≥0)φ^(k)(⊥)_* where ⊥ = (∅, ..., ∅) (vector containing only empty languages. I understand the general idea and it makes sense, but the inner workings are unclear. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEDIT: I see reddit does not support subscripts, but (k≥0) should be under the disjunct union symbol.",

My thought is that I'm going to start with backend programming, and venture on into frontend later into this project.  But, in this task I'v been given, I have encountered some problems.\n\nAll I ever done before programming wise was code small functions, with maybe calculations, string management and so on.\nQuestion: How do I actually start coding backend? \n\nMy backend programming language will be python, (with the help of Django?) And frontend will be HTML, CSS, Javascript.\n\nBest regards",

My first concern is getting all the full res video in to the cloud as at the moment it is sitting on drives. Is AWS the best place, if so which kind of storage is best for a developer to work from in future? the watermarked files would need instant downloadable access but the full res could be in the cheapest storage available even if it means waiting 24 hours to access. Would also need to link movie files to an entry in an online database.

(link at bottom, read directions if you would like to read directly in addition to my post)\nSHORT VERSION: IN SIGMOID NEURON NEURAL NETWORK(FEEDFOWARD)(3 layers), How can you use 4 output neurons instead of 10 for a program that expresses whether a handwritten digit is numbered 0-9 where the 10 neurons each represent 1,2 ,3 etc. how can you do that but with 4 neurons? (author provided math logic 42 = 16 ) what does that mean in this context?\nWhat is binary representation ? how do i find it or show it in a N.N. How do i find the proper weights and biases in the exercise detailed below?\nLONG VERSION:This is a 3 layer Feed Forward Neural Network made of Sigmoid Neurons. The author is is describing how to build a N.N. to classify handwritten digits. The Input Neuron Layer has 778=24x24 neurons to represent the intensities of the image pixels. The second or \"hidden\" layer has a varied number of neurons. \"The output layer of the network contains 10 neurons. If the first neuron fires, i.e., has an output ≈1, then that will indicate that the network thinks the digit is a 0. If the second neuron fires then that will indicate that the network thinks the digit is a 1. And so on. A little more precisely, we number the output neurons from 0 through 9, and figure out which neuron has the highest activation value. If that neuron is, say, neuron number 6, then our network will guess that the input digit was a 6. And so on..\" I understand this all, But then, he says \"A seemingly natural way of doing that is to use just 4 output neurons, treating each neuron as taking on a binary value, depending on whether the neuron's output is closer to 0 or to 1. Four neurons are enough to encode the answer, since 42= 16 is more than the 10 possible values for the input digit. \" i do not understand at all how you could 4 outputs to express 10 different possibilities. Please help me understand this.\nAnd later, he has us do a exercise \"There is a way of determining the bitwise representation of a digit by adding an extra layer to the three-layer network above. The extra layer converts the output from the previous layer into a binary representation,(Illustrates a figure where the new outputs are 4 in total(Don't know if that is specific to the 4 outputs described earlier or just a random representation). . Find a set of weights and biases for the new output layer. Assume that the first 3 layers of neurons are such that the correct output in the third layer (i.e., the old output layer) has activation at least 0.99, and incorrect outputs have activation less than 0.01\" How do i find weights and biases in this specific problem( i know how to calculate them kinda like using sigmoid function i can do that, but just not completely sure how to use it through whole N.N.) http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html To read the problem in greater length and context, open the provided link and scroll to \"A simple network to classify handwritten digits\".\nTHANK YOU&lt;3",

I've been attempting it for two weeks and have it mostly working except for one key part. Any advice would be very helpful. Also, If there is a better sub for this, please lmk.\n\nThe assignment is to implement merge sort on intervals. In our merge procedure however, we are also supposed to combine intervals that 'touch' or 'overlap'\n\nAn example input:\n\n     3\n     -1 40 1 30\n     2 3 -5 2\n     3 4 7 1\n\nThe format is the first line is # of intervals, each line after is :\n\nleft numerator, left denominator, right numer, right denom\n\nA negative numerator means the interval is \"closed\" at that point. \n\nSo for example, the interval (2/3, 5/2] overlaps with the interval (3/4, 7/1) so they would be combined as (2/3, 7/1).\n\nI have my merge sort working currently just sorting by x values of the intervals. I understand the math of how to check if intervals are overlapping and combine them (we aren't allowed to use division, and, therefore, no floating-point). \n\nWhat I cannot understand is how to do this through the recursive calls of merge sort. How do I keep track of what indices in my array of structures have already been merged and should not be looked at? I've thought about shifting elements of the array, but this is quadratic and not nlogn as my code needs to be. I've thought about incorporating return values into the merge and mergesort routines, but that didn't seem to go anywhere.\n\nI just really need a push in the right direction, as I feel like I've been overthinking it... Office hours have been no help, and after two weeks, I think I need different minds to help.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

        "text": "Hello, I am a Junior Java Developer and have been assigned the task of creating an application that performs a lot of database queries, updates and selects.\n\nWe have a nice framework in place that allows singleton access of jdbc connections. I have started with having different classes for each database I need access to using static methods to perform the various queries. There will eventually be many queries (20ish) per database access object. They either query and return a populated data object or update the database, there is never need to carry data between methods.\n\nNow my question stems from a concern from a few co-workers. They insist that they do not like this single class operation, and I cannot understand it for the life of me. This class allows for me to keep all database access in one place and just pass in parameters. I can create methods that describe the operation and the class name itself describes the database which is being operated upon.\n\nUsing this allows me to not worry about having random query strings, try/catches, and data sources scattered throughout the logic classes throughout the application. \n\nWith that being said as the amount of queries grow I will seperate certain things into other classes, for example I had an idea of doing something like.\n\n    SpecificDB.Insert.Operation(params);\n    List&lt;DBInfo&gt; info = SpecificDB.Retrieve.Operation(params);\nSo yes the Insert and Retrieve would reference separate objects but isn't necessary to do like this as its just an idea I had. To me this just seems cleaner, organized, and more maintainable than just setting up the connection and query for every class than needs to execute some query. I guess I just do not understand my co-workers concerns, and they have not given me a good reason to change how I feel about it.\n",

So they have different time constraints based on language listed on their [website](https://www.hackerrank.com/environment) and reading though that seemed pretty interesting.\n\nc/c++ was champion with 2 seconds, obviously. Java, However was given 4 seconds. With JIT and all I thought Java was believed to be c++ 's equal. Of course, the kinds of program written for HR isn't representative of programs generally written. But still, wasn't it a bit too high?\n\nPython was 10, seemed ok to me. My biggest surprise was however pypy, with 3 secs it was the runner-up, even before Java. I have been programming in Python for 3 yrs, never gave it much thought before, until now.\n\nHaskell was 5 secs, and judging by the opinions of Haskell community, this too seems to be an underestimate. However, I personally think Haskell's standard library's data structures have comparatively bad complexity. Don't know for sure, still a noob in that.\n\nRust was 5 secs. Wasn't the whole point of Rust's existence the fact that it's as fast as C despite being blah blah...That seemed like a pretty bold ambition. How close is Rust to that end? has HR got it completely wrong?\n\nI would love to hear thoughts of people regularly using these languages on their position in the list. \n\nEDIT : It is NOT a benchmark. It is hackerrank's attempt to answer, \"If a code takes 2 secs to run in c++, how long is it going to take in python? or Java? or....\". The goal of this is to ensure language choice doesn't play a role in acceptance of an answer. Specifically, a perfectly good solutions isn't thrown a \"TIMEOUT\" simply for being written in a comparatively slow language.",

Sort I by e_i and select feasible I_i in that order. (In other words, a standard interval scheduling problem solved by greedy algorithm).\n\nProof of greedy algorithm's optimality: Fix the optimal solution S_opt such that we maximize the cardinality of the union of S and S_opt. \n\nBut suppose some feasible I_x which ends before I_y, where I_y is within S_opt. Because the union of (S_opt\\I_y) and I_x is feasible, we have a contradiction, and thus the greedy algorithm is optimal.\n\nMy question is, where is the contradiction? I'm just not seeing it. Have I missed something? I tried asking the professor and they just repeated what they had said before. StackExchange has always felt incredibly hostile, so I thought I would reach out to you all. ",
