MacReady-The Thing this is Russell playing the Everyman in a situation that requires a hero but no they get him a man who’s out for himself \n\n3: Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley-Alien franchise Weaver plays a very interesting character having to deal with all these alien creatures that keep showing up and she shows the fear that one would have in that situation very well \n\n2: Ricardo Montalban as Khan-Star Trek ll he’s Khaaaaaan \n\n1: Peter Capaldi as The Doctor-Doctor Who Capaldi is easily one of the best actors to play The Doctor and his performance is very commanding but also has a cool uncle vibe",

        "text": "I'm watching Close Encounters of the Third Kind today (RIP Melinda Dillon), and in the scene where the numbers (coordinates) are coming in, one of the scientists says \"Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.\"  So I was curious how far that was really.  About 2.1 million kilometers.  It turns out that the L1 &amp; L2 Lagrange point (James Webb is at L2) is about 1.5 million kilometers, or about 5 light seconds.  That's close enough since we don't really know what \"roughly\" means.\n\nSo that's my theory.  The aliens parked the ship at L1 or L2 until the end of the movie.  Doesn't take much energy to just sit there and it's a nice place to temporarily park if you're visiting Earth.  There were no man made satellites at those locations until 1978 (at L1) which was after Close Encounters.\n\nOf course the aliens had the ability to travel of relativistic speeds (abductees hadn't aged), so probably no need to conserve energy, but still I'm sticking with my theory.",
