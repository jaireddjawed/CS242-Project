I often catch the tail end of a marathon on Comedy Central and will simply multitask during commercial breaks. Or in my nightly routine of looking for something to watch  (before I usually decide to check out Hulu/Netflix/HBOMax)  I recently found myself transfixed in the glare of the last  \\~30 minutes of “The Departed” on AMC because I love the movie’s conclusion  (even though the swearing and some of the violence is edited out).\n\nSo I would like to know what tv shows or movie/scenes are you willing to watch in spite of commercial breaks/edits!",

        "text": "This won’t be shocking to many of you, but it is sad to see all the same – the homophobes have arrived. The third episode of *The Last of Us* (Long, Long Time) has been hailed by many as one of the best episodes of television in years. For me, it ranks alongside the best episodes of the Wire, Breaking Bad, the Sopranos, True Detective, and Game of Thrones. It is a largely self-contained story of a closeted libertarian prepper (ahem, survivalist) finding love in the apocalypse and it is just outrageously well done.  \n\nFor those of you that look at IMDb ratings, you’ll note that episode 2 received a 9.3, the pilot garnered a 9.2, and episode 3 is currently at 8.1 (likely to go down further). The spread of ratings for episodes 1 and 2 are completely normal. For example, 63.4% of users gave episode 2 a 10/10 while **1.2%** of users gave the episode a 1/10. For episode 3 (Long, Long Time) about a gay couple, 53.6% of users gave it a 10/10 and **24.9%** of users gave it a 1/10. This is a **1975% increase** in 1/10 ratings beween episodes 2 and 3.\n\nEpisode 2 had 5.7 million first night viewers and episode 3 had 6.4 million first night viewers (an increase of **12.3%**). Episode 2 came out 10 days ago and has been rated on IMDb by 49,413 users whereas episode 3 came out 3 days ago and has been rated on IMDb by 71,506 users. This represents an increase of **44.7%** in the number of users rating the episode in 1/3 the time, yet first night viewers only went up by 12.3%. Shockingly, it appears that homophobes have review-bombed what is truly one of the greatest episodes of television in recent history because gay people exist. \n\nSo if you’re one to glance casually at IMDb episode ratings to see what people think about an episode (or if you should check it out), just know that a large number of people who never watched this episode rated it 1/10 because they lack the courage to overcome their parochial beliefs.\n\nIn fact, the episode is actually so self-contained that you could treat it like a 74 minute movie if you aren’t interested in watching a fungal zombie apocalypse show and it would absolutely be worth it.",

        "text": "As a kid, my mother used to love watching crime shows on our Dutch tv networks. This is about the time when crime shows like CSI were hitting it BIG. I remember watching this show from time to time, it being one of the few good memories I have from my childhood. So when I was browsing Prime Video and this popped up, I thought to give it a go. And my lord, I was not disappointed. \n\nThw shows follows a series of Cold Cases (Unsolved murders) and a team of homocide detectives trying to solve them. Some of the murders are old, like 1930's old, but that does not stop the show from creating an absolute masterpiece. The lead detective, Lily Rush, is probably one of the strongest crime show characters I've had the pleasure to watch, and the supporting roles from people like Jeremy Ratchford and Thom Barry are nothing less than genius. I think a LOT of shows really suffered from way too much focus on internal relations (*cough* Criminal Minds *cough*), and this show has some, but always in a paced manner. But the one true genius about this show that it does masterfully: focusing on the victim and the flashbacks. \n\nAnyone looking for a good crime show, please give it a go. It is, by far, the most favorite crime show I've watched, including Criminal Minds and Without a trace.",

        "text": "I finally got around to True Detective Season 1. After years of hype it was good to see it live up to the noise. A couple of takeaways: \n\nAs with most limited series these days, they could have done more with fewer episodes. Six instead of eight would have been a nice balance between the slow burn and the tension ramped up by the characters falling out and eventual reconciliation.\n\nI didn't take issue with \"who dun it\" I figured that out the first time I saw him interact with Rust. Rust's character intimated  flat and circular time more than once before and after his Nietzsche explanation, So the Big Bad was bound to come back around. Plus it was kind of a toss-away scene when they'd been so meticulous up to that point in reviewing everything and everyone.\n\nI take issue with the ending in a Game of Thrones kinda way; the transformation of Rust in a matter of days (with most of that spent in a coma). After eight episodes of slowly unraveling the story, his character kinda did a 360 in the last scene. \n\nI did some reading on reddit and didn't see anyone talk about the ending that would have made the most sense: Martin should have died. It would have been an impactful death, because Martin's life would have concluded the way his marriage did: with his reckless behavior forcing him into an event he would neither choose nor want. A depressing reality, keeping in line with the narrative's sense of despair. The pathos of his death, however, would have been his heroic effort to put the case to rest and renew a friendship with Rust before his ultimate sacrifice. Martin's death would have been the catalyst for Rust's change of behavior: getting stabbed, feeling the nothingness, then what lay beyond with his daughter and father etc. His self-reflections after Martin's death would include coming to believe Martin was part of that light now. Rust could then come to the conclusion that light co-exists (not takes over) the dark.\n\nI don't now if there's is still anyone on this forum that knows or cares to discuss, but I'd love feedback if you're inclined.",

Maybe they think that it detracts from the show but I don’t think it would.\n\nAnyway just had to get this off my chest.",
