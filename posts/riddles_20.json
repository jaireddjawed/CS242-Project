On the [Death Stranding discord server](https://discord.gg/mVkEmcQ) there is a bot that reacts to certain commands. There are 140 confirmed commands. The bot responds to these with pictures that appear to be clues and hints to an over-arching ARG. It's hard to determine if it's official, but people are still having fun trying to solve it. If you figure out this riddle, try typing the answer into the discord server with a ? at the start of the word. If the bot actually responds, you got it right. There is a search bar on the right of the server where you can check what's already been tried. If you don't feel like participating in the server, just leave your answers in the comments below and I will try them in the server.\n\nMaybe this [topographical map of the far side of the moon](https://cseligman.com/text/moons/moonfar.htm) will come in handy, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe following image shows some of the progress made in the overall ARG -\n\n[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/456926560050479108/456926855241400321/ds\\_arg\\_2.0.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/456926560050479108/456926855241400321/ds_arg_2.0.png)",

Person Tee always tells the truth. Person Ell always lies. You do not know who is Tee and who is Ell. There are two doors, one leading to success, and one leading to failure. They are not labeled and you do not know which is which. You may ask one and only one question to either Tee or Ell (not both, this is one question total). Both people are invisible to each other and are unaware of the existence of the other person; only you can see them. You may also not ask any hypothetical questions (e.g. an \"if\" question).\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no trickery, no cleverness, and no semantics involved. The answer is purely based on logic.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you determine which door leads to success?",
