        "text": "Hello, I have enjoyed seeing the posts there for a few years. It was a sub about blatantly inefficient/ironic situations created by over-the-top “market economy” behaviours to the point where it didn’t make sense and created more problems.\n\nIt was frankly quite funny and all (and a bit sad sometimes) and I have always been aware of the left-leaning political views of this sub which I am fine and supportive of.\n\nBut it appears that more and more posts are completely unrelated to the topic, they are about Chinese Communism and honestly propagandists for China. \n\nAnd today, someone posted a video of an obvious Chinese disinformation/propaganda campaign:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/118pxt4/the_american_dream_vs_the_chinese_dream/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nA lot of people are calling it out in the comments and are being removed, and a lot of other comments are complete apologists of everything Chinese. I have just been called a “fascist CIA agent” for saying China mistreats Uyghurs. \n\nSo what’s happening? Is it just a pro-China sub now?",

If I have a business, I can't close down an extra day. I can't pay employees the same amount of money as if they were working more.\nWouldn't this exacerbate the same problems we saw with Covid, like parents needing to spend extra time caring for their children because the school isn't open as much?\nWouldn't it also exacerbate the inflation problems since people would have more time and less people are working to create what's being consumed?\nI don't want to argue, I just want to know what I'm missing here.",

So the thing is, pretty much everybody I know started calling each other an \"NPC\" as an insult, It has also happened to me. And I have no idea where this whole thing even originated from. I've heard a lot of insults in my life, But I've never heard one like this. I've been called an \"NPC\" more than 3 times today, and I have no idea how to react, I'll be forever grateful if someone knows how this thing even started, as it is becoming extremely annoying now, I literally hear it on a daily basis, and I think I'm going insane.
