        "text": "I graduated from Duke this past May with a degree in Cultural Anthropology. In the spring of my junior year for my fieldwork methods class, I spent the semester studying and writing about the Reddit community. Was feeling nostalgic today and dug it back up, thought some of you might find it interesting! The abstract:\n\n*This paper seeks to explore the processes of community building and identity formation in the context of the anonymous online sphere, specifically focusing on the user-based, content-driven website Reddit.com. Through interviews with “Redditors” of all usage levels, ethnosemantic research, as well as firsthand interaction with and participation on the site, this study aims to draw new conclusions about the extent to which (if at all) conceptualizing the “real” and the “virtual” as separate domains is still applicable. In a space where comments, posts, and a username are the only markers that distinguish one’s identity, Reddit-specific language becomes the unifying factor for establishing a sense of community in this otherwise anonymous realm. This close analysis of Reddit, its users, and its culture hopes to shed some light on just how small the seemingly ever-narrowing gap between virtual engagement and real life interaction really is, and whether or not the online community is indicative of a need to re-conceptualize the idea of community in the twenty-first century.*\n\nThe Redditors over in r/Anthropology suggested you guys might appreciate it. I've included a Dropbox link for direct download below :)\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/15sddtiz3zynvo9/CA%20302%20FINAL%20ETHNOGRAPHY.pdf?dl=0",

        "text": "(Sans contentious plots)\n\nA while ago I posted a log-log curve that estimated a rank-size power curve from the top 500 subreddits as obtained from redditmetrics.com on November the 8th ([Google Docs spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b-DpRxxiJkCvmQ8OIwQ9EqyoVdrblzSFTV_RBGyLwGQ/edit?usp=sharing)]. Specifically, I was looking for a curve of the form\n\n  ** subscribers = K (ranking)^&amp;alpha; **\n\nand had obtained K = 65 millions and &amp;alpha; = -1.14.\n\nNow, one problem I had was that the first 50 subs or so didn't fit a power law pattern - possibly being mostly defaults and former defaults. Also, as reddit grows, the parameter &amp;alpha; could remain more or less stable, bur K will certainly change. But how? \n\nNow, a common pattern in Fermi estimates of things that should behave like a power law is to make &amp;alpha; = -1&amp; and K = maximum value. \n\nIt turns out that I have better RMSE in the top 500 subreddits (minus the top 10, which are really off) making K = 10 * the number of subscribers at /r/announcements, which makes the whole business much clearer. It does sound arbitrary, but it's the order of magnitude correction required to reach the K coefficient we had previously estimated, but it does give us an unambiguous updating rule. \n\nRedditmetrics.com says this is the 607th subreddit, which would give it 48 thousand subscribers, about 11% under it's currently 51 thousand.\n\nAlternately, the reverse formula for ranking solves to:\n\n  ** ranking = (subscribers / 10K)^-0.88 **\n\nWhich would give it 587th place (round it off to 590th rather than its current 607th. \n\nMy goal here is still having an easy-to-memorize, rounded-off formula. What is really needed is a larger sample and proper estimates from curated data, expunged from current and previous defaults. I don't have one free minute these days, though.",

It's interesting that he is *still* deliberating despite receiving dozens of responses (some within the first few hours). The news articles have not let up, thankfully!\n\nMultiple companies have been built by Jordan overnight based on the attention attracted by his offer and he coined URLs and nicknames for himself within hours of his announcement (triparoundtheworldguy, atickethome.org). He also seems to have PR emails set up for every step of the operation. His self-professed job title? *Slick marketing expert.*\n\nThe *seeming* charitability of his offer overshadows the fact that he only paid roughly $300-400 (the round-the-world trip was a fuel dump loophole) for what has amounted to tens of thousands of dollars of free publicity for his marketing name and overnight business ideas. Pepsi *dreams up* press releases that would yield so much organic online talk.\n\nMy core question from this is whether it matters if charitable causes are, in fact, genuine and nonprofit efforts to bring good to the world? If the essential good is dispensed (even if it's only a veneer over a slick viral marketing campaign), then should the community be content?\n\nDoes it matter how much Jordan profits from our community organizing if Jordan *will* ultimately give a woman named Elizabeth a plane ticket?\n\nDoes the genuineness of a Reddit cause really matter in the end?

Also, at the moment, my code hasn't finished getting all the data for the 28k mods; the site will be automatically updated though as the data gets collected and processed.\n* Subreddits ranked by popularity (activity) and total number of subscribers. The lists on the first page only include 10,000 subreddits; however, I have data (albeit a little old) on about 457,000 subreddits so far that you may view.\n* Individual moderator pages with the mod's rankings, total number of subscribers moderated, total number of subreddits moderated, list of subreddits currently moderating, list of previous subreddits moderated (little to no data yet though on previous subreddits).\n\nI don't have individual statistic pages on reddits since I feel that's already done quite a bit. So I'm focusing on moderator statistics.\n\nhttp://0bservat0ry.com/reddit.html\n\nI actually never saw stattit live, so I'm not sure what all it offered. Please let me know if there's an important feature that should be added. And let me know if you find any inconsistencies in the numbers!\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: [/r/0bservat0ry](http://reddit.com/r/0bservat0ry)",

        "text": "We've been thinking about this for a little while, and I thought it might be fun to get some ideas and opinions from you all, and maybe share a little data for navel gazing at the same time. I'm a long time reader, even long before I worked for reddit. I know you all typically focus a bit more on individual communities and less on reddit’s behavior as a whole, especially for new folks, but hopefully this is still relevant enough to be interesting.\n\nFirst, a definition: in web terms, a bounce rate is \"the percentage of people who view **exactly one page** on a website and then immediately leave\". As you might guess from reddit's UI and its approachability for new folks, we have a pretty high bounce rate for certain parts of the site.\n\nFor comparison:\n\n* [here's the bounce rate for new and returning users for listing pages](http://i.imgur.com/EHb9pY5.png) (the homepage and subreddit listing pages)\n* [here's the bounce rate for new and returning users for a comments page](http://i.imgur.com/uj2cMAR.png)\n\nAs you can see, the listing page bounce rate is around 26% for new users and 15% for returning. However, where we're really having problems is the bounce rate for comments pages. The bounce rate for new users is around **77%**, and returning users around 56%. That means that if people find reddit through things like google search, email, twitter, facebook or elsewhere, they're very likely to leave after seeing one post.\n\nIn some senses, this is really fine. There's a good portion of users who just want to see a thing and then leave. However, at the magnitude we're seeing, it's pretty clearly a hole, and there are people in that segment who would probably get value out of reddit if given the opportunity (and reddit would derive value out of them through community participation!)\n\nI'm curious: Do you have any ideas on how reddit could reduce the bounce rate for comments pages without harming the communities involved? We have some ideas of our own, but I'd rather not share them (yet) as I wouldn't want to influence any fresh thoughts from you all.\n\nAny thoughts appreciated!",

        "text": "In general, the most popular subreddits on an given issue are the broadest in scope. /r/pics, /r/music, /r/videos, etc.  A notable exception is for subreddits with a strong focus on original creative writing. /r/writingprompts is limited to stories that are posted in response to another poster's \"prompt\". /r/nosleep is limited to \"realistic horror\" fiction. \n\nNotably, there doesn't appear to be *any* reasonably large subreddit devoted to broad-based user-created fiction. /r/writing is large, but is about discussions of writing. not user submissions (except in one contained thread). All the \"submit your writing\" subreddits I've come across are small (&lt;10k subscribers), such as /r/creativewriting, /r/shortfiction, or /r/WritersGroup.\n\nWhy might this be the case? A few theories:\n\n- /r/WritingPrompts and /r/NoSleep have concepts that are allow for interactivity. \n\nIn the former, you have the prompt submitters, the people who upvote the prompts (influencing what gets written), the writers of the stories, then the people who upvote/comment on them. It makes for a more interactive experience than just dumping a story and getting comments on it.\n\nIn the latter, the whole \"everything is real, even if's not\" concept allows for role-playing and interactivity in the comments. (However, it seems that this factor is becoming less and less prominent, and r/NoSleep is now mostly just the most convenient place to post your horror fiction).\n\n- The premises reduce the impact of spammers.\n\nIf a subreddit allows only a constrained form of writing, it locks out all of those who might be tempted to sign up for reddit just to post their pre-existing works. In particular, /r/writingprompts' premise makes it exceptionally unlikely that you have already written something that happens to fit a prompt. \n\n- Path dependence\n\nI'm not so sure these explanations, or any are sufficient. They help explain why a general writing submission sub hasn't succeeded, but not so much why those *particular* subs are.  The subreddits seem just a little bit random to be as popular as they are. \n\nI wonder if \"random\" events like well-timed /r/bestof links managed to get them to their level of popularity, and network effects have kept them there. For instance, I could definitely imagine a world in which /r/writingprompts and /r/chainstories have an inverted number of subscribers. ",

        "text": "A few years ago, a brand new upstart airline began international service: Reddit Airlines. The route quickly ate up a lot of the business from older legacy carriers, primarily Digg Airways, which never recovered after their flagship plane crashed upon takeoff in front of a live TV audience. \n\nReddit Air mainly found success because of their innovative in-flight entertainment model, which allowed its passengers to choose the TV shows, movies, and even video games which would play during flights. The passengers loved it, and soon flights all around the world were filled with passengers glued to their screens as an old episode of Cosmos or a special on cute cats captured their imagination. \n\nThe early adopters of Reddit Air became the first frequent flyers, who were rewarded with their loyalty with even more say in determining the entertainment options. Because passengers could cast a vote anytime they flew,  these \"power flyers\" had much more say in what entertainment ended up on the screens, especially since Reddit Air only provided the Top 25 most desired entertainment options during a given period. \n\nThe challenge came as Reddit Air became more and more popular, eventually becoming the largest airline in the world. More and more passengers were taking their first Reddit Air flights, and used their voting power to primarily vote for the Fast and the Furious content. ALL of the Fast and the Furious content. All six films, associated games, even TV commercials. The new passengers couldn't get enough of Paul and Vin and voted consistently for their content. \n\nThe older power flyers were initially OK with seeing Vin Diesel on their screens - who doesn't love a bald man? - but as the weeks and months continued on, there was just too much Tokyo Drifting, and the frequent flyers became restless and began complaining to the customer service reps. \n\nBut lo, Reddit Air had a solution - they created a first class \"sub cabin\" and let the power flyers migrate to these smaller, more exclusive areas. Best of all, they have the most powerful flyers curate the content in their cabins, and soon the first class cabins were filled with high-quality, diverse content, ranging from science and history TED Talks, to high-level analysis of new trends in the gamer community. Some of these new cabins were emphatic about ridding their cabins of all Fast and the Furious content. That kind of stuff was for the rabble in the economy cabin. \n\nAs Reddit Air continued to get larger and larger, though, they continued building out the First Class cabins. Soon, what were just small, private cabins were becoming huge unto themselves as more and more people discovered the perks of flying first class. \n\nExcept then a conflict emerged - some of these new arrivals from the economy cabin noticed that their votes for Fast and the Furious weren't being taken into account. Dozens of people would be voting to see the latest webisode of FATF but the power flyers would be deleting their votes. \n\n\"What gives?\" the new flyers would ask. \"Why can't I watch Paul Walker here?\"\n\n\"We've seen literally everything Paul Walker has been in for months,\" the power flyers would answer. \"There's more to life than Tokyo drifting. We have a strict no-car racing content policy here in first class.\"\n\n\"But that's censorship!\" the new flyers cried. \"I thought Reddit Air was a democracy!\"\n\nThe power flyers would sigh and rub their temples at this. \"Reddit Air is a democracy. But this is the first class cabin. We have been flying for years to get here. We have seen the fallout of the all-Vin policies of economy. We have been given the power by the airline to curate our content, and so we do. You are welcome to go back to the economy cabin if you want more FATF content.\"\n\nThe new flyers didn't like this answer at all. They started shouting insults and epithets, threatened to follow the power flyers home after the flight was over, and mashed their vote buttons over and over again for Fast and the Furious. \n\nEventually the power users tired of the antics and, using the power given to them by the airline, escorted the unruly passengers out of the cabin. Even more yelling would take place at this, as well as cries of fascism and appeals to Socrates, who they claim had died for their right to watch Paul Walker and Vin Diesel power slide under semis. The power flyers invested in ear plugs, took lots of Valium, and did their best to enjoy the Ken Burns documentary on their screen. But eventually the acrimony got to many of them, and they gave up their curation duties. Lots of other power flyers were willing to step up for a bit as they, too, had grown tired of FATF, but many of them eventually wore out too. They began to spend most of their flights staring out the window instead of at their screen, muttering darkly about how Reddit Air might just end up like Digg Airways someday, and smiling to themselves as they imagined the wreckage. \n\nTL;DR Moderation is necessary to keep longtime users from seeing the same content over and over again. Mods don't get enough recognition for this work. ",

Finding #Total  number of posts made on reddit per day :                   \n          From last year's Reddit stats , there are about 40,855,032 posts  made in 2013 and the year before that there were 30 million posts ( and i can't find data before that).                \n          Now making an assumption that  this trend is linear(There is no reason for this to be), I can predict that there will be 50 million posts on reddit in 2014, so :                    \n          posts/day = post per year/No days in a year = 50,000,000/365 = 136986.30137 ~ 137000 posts ( i haven't taken 366 as no of days , as this is not an exact calculation)                              \n                                                                 \n      Now Finally , *drum rolls*  :             \n          x = 100*(50/137000)                \n          x = 0.03649635036 %                                   \n          So in general only about 0.037% of posts makes it to the front page.                                  \n                      \n    NOTE:               \n         1.

        "text": "How much does the first vote matter? I decided to test this by randomly upvoting or downvoting a number of new posts, then see what their final scores were. \n\nFrom around 6.40am-7.00am EST on October 29, I alternated between upvoting and downvoting the first post in the new queue for the defaults, 50 each. I realise this is a small sample size, however the intent was not to get a precise result so much as get an idea if there is a strong effect (as I hypothesised).\n\nDue to deleted posts, there are only 41 \"liked\" posts and 36 \"disliked\" posts left. (You really get to see spam filters in action when doing this).  \n\n**The scores**\n\n*Mean Upvoted Post*: 178 points  \n*Median Upvoted Post*: 3 points  \n*Mean Downvoted Post*: 64 points  \n*Median Downvoted Post*: 0.5 points  \n\n**Top 10 Scores, Upvoted Posts**:\n\n2742  \n2682  \n840  \n630  \n95  \n77  \n64  \n24  \n17  \n16  \n\n**Top 10 scores, Downvoted posts**:\n\n1932  \n128  \n78  \n46  \n30  \n24  \n17  \n16  \n7  \n4  \n\n(Note: there is some fuzzing of the scores, scores below 0 show up as 0, and my vote also pushes up the first category a little).\n\n**Analysis**\n\nOne vote definitely plays a significant role. Exactly how big this is would need a bigger sample size, but in this sample it roughly triples the score to upvote vs downvote. Also, if a single vote can do this, it highlights just how powerful abusing multiple votes can be.\n\nI also think this lends credence to my not-very-well received claim that [there is a fair amount of luck in karma](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1cd5vt/how_much_luck_is_there_in_karma/). The idiosyncrasies of the people who happen to be browsing the new queue when you make your post are mostly a matter of luck. If you happen to be unlucky enough to run into one or two people who dislike your post when it's new, then it has a much smaller chance of succeeding.",

But I think this is a clever thing they've done here... this particular ad looks exactly like a regular post, so it piqued my interest. I clicked and sure enough it took me to a random subreddit; but what's more interesting to me is the commentary in that thread. Effectively what reddit has done here is get a bunch of people to check out some new subreddits, then provide a small karma-driven comment about where they went, and the best of those comments are upvoted to the top. So at that point, they have a list of clever comments with links to the new subreddit they visited, and of course I can't help but click on a few.

        "text": "A common trend I've noticed on r/futurology is the growing number of over-exaggerated claims made by authors of science magazines concerning a recent \"study\" done by scientists. After reading many of these articles, you can make the conclusion that the authors have the same tone to them, the sophomore year of highschool that taught you how to write an attention grabbing thesis. Some of these attention grabbers include, \"Have you ever wanted to live on mars? Well in 15 years you can!\" Or , \"In three years, we might be able to switch our limbs to 3-D generated ones as scientist as *insert elite university here* have concluded that..\"\n\nThe worst part of it all is that there's no link to the actual study being done. Back in 2013, a NASA physicist David White had supposedly found a flaw in the Alcubierre Drive theory which proposes that a warp-drive is the most theoretically possible interstellar space system, however, it would require the energy of all of Jupiter in one room, White theorized that changing the shape of the spacecraft into a doughnut/ring like structure would greatly reduce the energy required to warp space (in fact, some estimates claim 500 Terra-watts, a Fusion reactor is estimated to power 5 Terra-watts per hour.)\n\nI knew it was only a matter of time that White would warp out of the theoretical phase and announce that a warp-drive is in fact practical, however, the science journalists made it out to be a different story. Independent and Large-Label science journalists churned out articles praising NASA for \"working on a warp-drive that can take people to other solar systems.\" The problem escalated when only one science journal interviewed White in person and had most of the information concerning \"theoretical testing\" being done at the NASA science labs. White exclaimed that him and his team were only working on the theoretical applications of his theory, which included a boring (at least to the general population) test which includes reflecting light off of surfaces and detecting the momentum and certain spaces. To this day, White hasn't announced anything yet.\n\nThis is of course only one example of the scientific journalism giving the audience and oversimplified view of things. r/futurology is filled with everyday folk who just \"have an interest in technological advancements.\" There's not much critical discussion going on in the subreddit now, only Elon Musk praise and average minded people with no expertise in the area discussing how other countries are going to somehow compete for space-elevators and why Fusion reactors always seem to be \"20 years away.\"\n\nWhat's your thoughts on the sub?",

That said.. \n \n I've noticed a bit of a trend over the years, in the rise of the the divergent submissions - where you have a heavily upvoted submission, but the comment threads inside will majorly attack the submission. For example in this recent submission to /r/lifehacks, [the submission itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/2k0axp/how_to_be_productive/) has over 1,000 upvotes at around 74% favorability. Yet at least 7 of the best comments in that thread (so far) are exclaiming the shittiness of the submission.  \n  \nSo how does a submission get so many upvotes, but such a terrible critique? It's like a movie that gets terrible ratings, but people watch anyway. \n  \nI'm sure there's a lot of different reasons and I've love everyone else's ideas; but **my hypothesis is that there are two kinds of redditors at play here**. On one hand you've got the **commenters** who look for a discussion of the submission or their tangents - often these redditors are more interested in the topic since they have decided to stick around longer than just viewing the submission. On the other hand you've got the (allegedly) less interested **Hyper-voters** who scroll through reddit upvoting and downvoting submissions they enjoy or not, but not sticking around long enough to really engage in the submission.   \n  \n It is apparent that for some incidents, and I think increasingly, there are more **Hyper-voters** than there are **commenters** otherwise we would never even see these posts. I'm curious to what the grander implications of this means for the changing reddit population.",

        "text": "I (like almost all those who browse reddit, and probably most of you) spend the vast majority of my browsing reading/viewing posts that have already been heavily upvoted, especially in larger subreddits and for posts which require a significant time investment to consume.\n\nFor instance, my approach for /r/nosleep is basically:   \n\n* Sort by top of all time  \n* Read the most upvoted story that I haven't read yet  \n* Hide the story (for easier future navigation).   \n\nI'll vary this a little for slightly less upvoted stories that have premises that are of greater interest to me, but I think that this approach is close to the optimal way of reading the best NoSleep stories.\n\nThe issue, though, is that while this approach is personally beneficial for me and probably you, if everyone did it, the subreddit wouldn't function as well. I am effectively free-riding off all the people who were willing to read those stories when they were new and untested, when they could have read what would likely be better stories if they acted like me.\n\nThe \"free rider problem\" in economics occurs when people don't have to pay for something they benefit from, so it is \"underprovided\" compared to the theoretical \"social optimum\".\n\nFor example, there might be 10,000 NoSleep readers similar to me who would be theoretically willing to pay an average of $5 per year for a small increase in our perceived quality of the top stories. It may be the case that say, an extra 100 people reading and voting on an average of 10 hours of new and rising NoSleep stories per year would improve the signal-to-noise ratio enough to create this increase in quality. The average *social benefit* of each hour's browsing for these people would be $50 an hour, and they would gladly do it for considerably less, but because there isn't a plausible way to arrange a deal between people like me and people like them, they don't do it as much as they would and new voting is \"underprovided\".  \n\n(Note that the existence of people voting on new posts isn't a refutation of the free rider problem. There is obviously an incentive to vote on new posts (mostly the feeling of control of what others will see), but I'm saying this incentive isn't as large as it \"should\" be).\n \n  \n***\n\n  \nSo what does this all mean? Well, if this analysis is correct we should be looking at ways to encourage early voting, particularly by people who are \"good\" critics.\n\nThe \"bellwether\" trophy seems like a decent concept. If you're very good at predicting what other people will like, then your votes will help ensure that the typical redditor gets posts that they will like. Now, I realise that a lot of people here are somewhat snobbish in that they don't like the things lots of other redditors like. But this concept is value neutral. If there's a subreddit where people like silly fluff, then someone who is good at sorting out what kind of silly fluff other readers like is providing a service for those readers. The main problem with the bellwether trophy as it presently exists is that there's only one per day, which means it provides little incentive for the casual browser, and encourages voting on lots and lots of easily digestible content (so isn't much help for NoSleep). Something like subreddit-specific bellwether trophies, if doable, would be a possible solution.\n\nThere is a second-order possibility which would be more popular with \"snobs\", which is that it's good to have (for the lack of a better word) \"elites\" voting early, even if they don't vote up the things most current redditors like, in hopes that the \"lowest common denominator\" will be driven away and more \"elites\" attracted. While I have sympathy for the idea, I think it's much harder to fundamentally change the demographics of the site than it is to help  the current users get a better experience. And reiterating the previous paragraph: from a value neutral perspective I might not personally enjoy a lot of the \"fluff\" on reddit, but it appears that a lot of people do and any \"social benefit\" calculation take into account their preferences.\n\nMy last questions are about what this implies for our personal behaviour. Do I have a \"duty\" to vote on new posts, because I've free-ridden off others doing just that? Does my \"duty\" vary on how well I think I will perform this task? For instance, if my tastes are very unusual for a redditor, my voting might be seen as adding \"noise\".",

It happened twice on /r/jobs where one person got in a long debate with me - until I looked up his history &amp; realized he was 22 years old and never had a job (I'm over 10 years older &amp; have worked for a decade).  Another time, a first year graduate student (again - I found by looking through his history) was trying to tell me all the mistakes I made on the PhD job market...from the perspective of someone who had already gone through it (though his history revealed he just got into the school).  Also, there's also an IO psych masters degree student who has thousands of Karma points from that sub alone, and this person never held a job.  He made some idiotic replies to me as well... thus far, nobody on /r/jobs seems capable of giving any actionable / useful advice - but they all think they can say whatever is on their mind for some unknown reason.  I just wonder what that reason is.  Why would 3 people with no working credentials think they can advise a 35 year old PhD how to look for a specific job...and then get mad when I point out why their advice is wrong (because they have no idea what they are talking about)?\n\nAs someone with a PhD, I've seen my research discussed on here - and the people discussing it haven't even read the articles. I don't even think people read the abstracts...perhaps, the title or a summary at most.  I can't even read the discussions because it's so far away from what the research is actually about that it just makes me too angry to read after 2 minutes.  Again, why do people do this?  What do they get out of it, internally, to act like they posses some great amount of knowledge when, in reality, the opposite is true (and skimming their history reveals the opposite is true too, so who are they fooling)?\n\nLast, I posted once asking about a haircut - if I looked better one way or another, and someone felt the need to personally email me saying I have to love myself for who I am and don't change for another person (when I never said anything about \"another person\" or caring what other people thought - it was actually more related to the weather &amp; humidity than anything).  This guy actually said that  he thought if he didn't email me, I wouldn't see his super-important life affirmation.  Uh, really? I was asking about a haircut - not having my face reconstructed.  Granted, 20 other people gave normal opinions (with the result being - both were equally good)....but the unsolicited Oprah pep talk &amp; other unsolicited/bad advice is really starting to get to me. I really only look in subs that are brainless at this point.\n\n**TLDR**:  What is the underlying motivation of people who give advice - but are not qualified to do so?  Where is their acknowledgement of where their knowledge ends?  And, why do these people get so mad when you point out that they are wrong?  Also, if people want to discuss / criticize scientific research, why can't they be bothered to actually READ what they are discussing?",

        "text": "I have been thinking about making this post for a while and a recent /r/askreddit thread has finally motivated me to put my words on paper as it were. I feel like this post is correct for this sub but I will happily get rid of it if it isn't. \n\nDepression seems to be a common thing that often comes up on reddit mainly in askreddit threads but also in a variety of other subs from time to time. When people post that they have depression, the comments are usually highly upvoted and gilded with lots of supporting comments. In most other contexts this would be considered to be a circlejerk and I don't say that lightly as I would never want to trivialise the state of someone's mental health. However, the prevalence of the comments and their popularity has made me question several things about reddit itself. \n\nIn other communities in which I interact; be it with friends, family, co-workers etc I have never encountered this concept of depression to any extent that is displayed on this site. Of course it is a private matter which maybe only is discussed through the relative anonymity that this platform allows, but the frequency of the claims of depression mentioned makes it seem like a highly common thing which far more people suffer from that I am aware of. Is it therefore a characteristic of the dominant demographic that uses reddit? Or is depression a genuine condition of mental health that far more people than I ever considered suffer from? Is this my own ignorance to mental health or is reddit a purely depressed place in general? \n\nWhat I am cautious in saying is if people are confusing genuine depression with something that everyone experiences once in a while; apathy, frustration or sadness that things are not as easy as they would have liked. Is there an aspect of this site that fosters these negative attitudes without actually exploring if these attitudes are valid?\n\nI maybe completely mistaken and through my own ignorance have possibly insulted people, for that I am genuinely sorry. What do you guys think? Has anyone else noticed what I have and what are your thoughts on it? \n\nEdit: Words and such",

        "text": "Today I've been thinking about the hot algorithm. I think it's excellent for general use, but reddit being reddit, there are some use cases for which it doesn't fit well.\n\nIf I see a posting on /r/learnpython with twelve comments, I skip past it. Having some knowledge of the subreddit, I know that twelve comments almost certainly means the OP's question has been answered, and so there's no need for me to get involved.\n\nThis is true for a number of my subscriptions, and it's because I don't read them for me; I read them for the *OP*. The purpose of those subreddits is to answer questions, not disseminate news or spur discussion, and so what we really want to promote are highly-upvoted questions with few responses.\n\nSo now I'm wondering what other \"types\" of subreddits there are, from a sorting perspective. What examples can you guys come up with?",
