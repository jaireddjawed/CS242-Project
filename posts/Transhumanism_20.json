Neuralink is company made by Elon Musk that is looking at merging the human mind with AI. If we advance in this we would be able to download memories and do all kinds of shit. So if we were to develop super Intelligent AI with the potential to rule over humanity, couldn’t we just merge our minds with the AI and eliminate that threat? Yeah humanity would still be endangered and eventually extinct, but being merged with AI will allow us to do the same shit we did as humans AND more, so we wouldn’t even need or want humanity any more.

        "text": "Empathic brain-to-brain networking refers to individuals being able to experience each other's emotions as if they were their own. This would be by means of cybernetic implants connected to the parts of their brains responsible for processing emotions that transmit emotional data to other people equipped with those implants. \n\nThe capacity for empathy is one of the most important things that enable people to coexist in society. While human beings are capable of empathy to some extent, it is something that has to be learned rather than something everyone possesses by default. While a person can extrapolate another person's emotional state by being aware of his/her situation and watching his/her verbal and nonverbal cues, he/she cannot truly know first-hand what that person is feeling. Due to this limitation, human empathy doesn't prevent acts of war, crime, and slavery that have been prevalent throughout history. Such acts of cruelty have been caused in part by an inability or unwillingness to acknowledge the suffering of the victims. To perpetrators of cruelty, other people are either cattle to be exploited or vermin to be exterminated. The inability to feel the effects one's behavior has on other people is why human beings are capable of exploiting, torturing, or murdering other human beings without even the least bit of remorse. \n\nSince human beings' current capacity for empathy is insufficient when it comes to preventing or at least discouraging cruelty, I believe the entire species could benefit from the ability for each individual to feel other people's emotions. That way, if a person wrongs someone else intentionally or otherwise, that person, regardless of his/her prior ability to empathize with others, will feel the enough of the victim's pain to regret having hurting him/her. As such, people with empathic brain-to-brain networking made possible by cybernetic neural implants will be less likely to hurt or kill other people, therefore allowing humanity as a whole to live more peacefully. \n \nFeel free to discuss the merits, drawbacks, and challenges of altering human beings to be able to feel other people's emotions as a means of enabling understanding and harmony on a local, national, and global scale.

        "text": "It is so appealing to think about, I don't want super powers, I don't want to be elite, I just want my chronic pain and the limitations it forces upon me to be gone.\n\nWhen I see people who have gotten their prosthetic limbs and how they are happy to have those limitations gone I wish the same, when you have chronic pain you learn to hate the human body and how fragile it is, I always said I wish I could be downloaded into a robotic body, I can only imagine that people who have the means might choose to become cyborgs themselves as this technology continues to progress.",

        "text": "So imagine this...\n\nCybernetics/Prosthetics have evolved to the point where the Human brain/mind and/or mind can now be uploaded or transplanted into a full-body prosthetic, AKA an entirely synthetic and manufactured simalcrum of the Human body. This artificial body is superior to the biological original in most or every way imaginable...\n\nHow do you think this would impact Human sexuality and reproduction? Would the manufacturers and developers create artificial genitals or specialized programming to allow sexual activity? Would they not even bother with such trivial functions seeing as how at this point Human evolution and technological progress have merged completely? Would these new bodies be sexless with only a vague representation of gender or sexual characteristics like facial or body hair, breasts and male/female anatomy or not have any at all (genderless humanoid beings that are neither male or female in function and appearance). \n\nWould you opt to replace your flesh and blood self to become a superior being if it meant sacrificing your sexuality? Or do you think the creators of these new organisms would take our primal need to reproduce and excuse my language but...well...our basic need to f*** into account.\n\nI for one would definitely replace parts of my body with cybernetics, but letting go of my sexuality is one thing I could never do. Sexual pleasure, no matter how primal and \"outdated\" some Transhumanists consider it to be, is to me a very important and essential part of daily life. (I love sex lol)\n\nTL;DR Would you become a full-body cyborg that was superior in every way to a natural Human if it meant sacrificing sex and/or masturbation for good?",
