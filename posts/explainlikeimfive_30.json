When we use ISP proxies, we get extremely slow download speeds compared to others.  Everybody I know gets 200+ mbps on proxies but we're getting between 10-20.  There are multiple factors I have considered and nothing makes sense. Internet speed wise two of us have 1gb plans with Spectrum and one of us has AT&amp;T fiber.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I have tested other peoples proxies with the same provider but they are getting 200+ mbps download speeds which makes no sense to me even when testing multiple at once.\n2. If I only test one proxy out of my batch of 100, I get 1-200 mbps.  But when I test multiple at once, they go down to 10-20 mbps sometimes lower.  Everybody I've spoken with does not have this issue.\n3. I have tried 3 different proxy providers all which other people are using fine but they all give me the same issues re: download speed.\n4. I have even changed internet service providers to no avail.\n5. I realized most proxy servers are on the east coast so I thought it may be a distance thing since I'm on the west coast but there's somebody local to me who has no issues with proxies and does the same exact things I am trying to do with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anybody can help me fix this issue I am willing to pay.",
