        "text": "Part 5 of the adventures of our friendly leafy necromancer, and by leafy I mean a fetchling named Zelac and everyone in my party is mildly deaf \n\npart 4 here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/66buru/pathfinder_salad_the_necromancer_master_of_bran/\n\nPart 1 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5m7ymg/salad_the_necromancer_and_the_paladin_of_the_rcmp/\n\nLeaving the dragon gate in the hands of the aspect of evil (GO TEAM BAD GUYS!) we go towards Beijing and meet up with Lee and Lou two of the good immortals! they have brought the other good immortals and are currently piling summoning materials and doing what immortals do best, argue like old married couples.  Salad examines the ritual and gets very excited, I push them to finish the argument and do it! The Zhao (monkey people leader) arrives and his men are carrying a Jar! the elemental has returned! \n\nWe have a task to do before we get to see the ritual though, lee takes us back to Taiwan, remember Taiwan? I remember Taiwan, we got attacked by mist bullsh*t last time we were there. SO Lee teleports us there and we notice its evening, we are in Taipei and I recall Maia the friendly Kitsune that I talked to last time we were here, we go bug her for the night, as she has her house ringed in torches, which we further fortify, and while we hear the angry oni beasts, none approach, we are awoken once by frenzied growls a howl of pain and wet snapping noises.  The next morning we find the gnawed remains of a poor deer that wandered too close to the oni mist.  The next morning we thank Maia for her hospitality and bestow gifts upon her (its kinda cool being the ones bestowing things) we give her gold, valuable items and Yao grass, and we set out following Lee (or was it Lou?) to the water's edge.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nLee bids us enter the ocean and strides forward. we all follow after a moment, and we meet another immortal and his sea dragon wife who can project a bubble of air for us. we learn that Taiwan is actually a crust formed on top of the Lion turtle, and we need his power for the coming fight.\n\nthe sea dragon takes us to some underground caves which she cannot enter, and we advance untill we reach a large cavern with many small holes and one large one, Oni begin pouring out, screaming and shrieking, Untill we literally cover the fire immune valkyrie with oil and light her on fire, she becomes a flaming beacon the Oni scurrying away we go down the large tunnel, going past where all the Oni-scratch marks are. getting warmer and deeper untill we enter an mindbogglingly vast cavern, with the head of the Lion turtle resting on the other side, we approach and it slowly stirrs and awakes, it talkes to Lee and he says alright we should move its gonna destroy Taiwan when it moves.... 2 things.... 1) the party objects to that much needless death. 2) why were we brought along anyways? oh... as bait... the lion turtle needed to smell mortals (foood) to wake up....\n\nanyways we come up with a solution, the Paladin casts reduce compainion on it! unfortunately the gm says the turtle is so vast it doesnt fully reduce, it stops at a large size statue we have to drag but thats ok, the Valkyrie summons a bunch of celestial gorrilas to drag it out.... creative!\nin the main hall the Onis are returning but Zelac runs a wall of fire the length of cavern and chases them off.we meet the sea dragon and her immortal who take the turtle and leave and lee takes us back.\n\nwe have a nice evening to rest and recharge before the ritual tomorrow, the valkyrie figures out she can summon her armour onto the paladin... paladin basically becomes invincible at this point, well not invincible, but absurdly powerful for our level.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nthe next morning the ritual begins, dramatic chanting the sky darkens a portal opens.... A portal to Chinese hell! Salad is excited because Yama is cool, and apparently the rest of the party has been to hell/met him before so he's down to help. the denizens of hell pour out of the portal, Yama strides forth, the elemental presents him with a cauldron of tea, apparently its a thing, the elemental is a master chef and has made amazing tea for him before. Yama heartily thanks him and they begin the advance!\n\nThe Valk summons her armour onto the paladin, giving him 4 angelic wings and a glowing countenance, Not wanting to let the Paladin advance alone Salad uses a spell to grow dark leathery bat like wings (fly-necromantic) the paladin immediately recognizes the spell and tells Salad that there will be a stern talk after this is all over. we Watch the battle and approach, it is determined that the Emperor is trying to use mind control to use the 4 dragons of the cardinal directions to manifest the god dragon which he will then fuse with and take over.... so we want to stop that...  \n\napproaching the city we see the black dragon has been raised already and is locked in titanic combat the armies of hell spilling over the walls, fighting terracotta soldiers and onis regrouping behind Yama we approach the palace, untill a massive void yai oni bursts from a building and charges at Yama, locking him in mighty combat. we must approach on our own now...\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\ncutting down an alley a large oni crashes into the building at the far end, we quickly blast it and dispatch it, (big star here was the funky setup the inquisitor has with an immovable rod and a double hackbutt- isnane damage I tell you) which I then raise as a skeleton..... The paladin looks at me and re-iterates... A STERN TALKING TO....\n\nwe approach the palace and have to figure out how to get in, the solution was genius on the elemental's part- he uses windform to sneak over the walls, then swaps to earth form to minic the appearance of a terracotta soldier then he casually walks past them and flips the gate lever to open the door, we all charge in and destroy the soldiers there.\n\nthe last battle of the day was us vs 3 oni mages, and 8 smaller onis, which we bombed into oblivion, not as easily as we would have hoped, but we still won out, especially with the whole undead immune to cold thing prevented the Oni mages cone of cold destroying my minion guards, I raise the 3 Oni mages... realize I am at my magic cap for minions and go oh shit, command undead to relcaim one of them, then we charge forward, Lee and Lou meet up with us, tell us to go stop the rituals while they deal with the emperor....

The elemental is still in a jar back with the Vanaran.\n\nwith minor amounts of combat along the way, just an annoying mermaid, with some sharkheaded goons we thumped we arrive at the monastary! \n\nthe actual monastary is of little importance to us, what is important is the caves and grottos beneath it, there are two huge Buddha statues\n flanking a series of cave openings, we opt to go into the left cave, after a 40 or so foot hallway, we enter into another room which is just a square rough carved room with 4 doors (n,e,s,w oriented) being as we follow a plan for things we go left marking the door with chalk.... entering another identical hallway followed by an Identical room.... hrmmm well we chalk mark and go left only to find the same thing.... we do this again and again, realizing we should theoretically be going in a circle, but we only see chalk marks on every other room, meaning somethings weird, we stop, tie rope around one of my skeletons and tell him to go left and left and left untill he finds us or to tug the rope 3 times if he hits a barrier/end of the rope. Off my minion scampers and eventually we see him again but its spooled out wayyy more of the rope than it should have, so we spool him back and decide this time we send him right, similar instructions just to see, but he spools out a bit then stops....\n\n\nSo the paladin bravely marches after him, finding that its standing there confused by 3 funky glowing orbs around it... they jump to the paladin immediately but nothing really happens, so the paladin and the skeleton return to the party.... when they come in sight Salad says \"goddamit not will o'wisps\" and bamb they try to feed on salad and the Valkyrie (GM decided that because wisp feed on fear and neither the skeleton or paladin felt fear so it wouldnt attack them) so zap... except Salad and the Valkyrie both resist electricity so they did little to no damage before being obliterated (the paladin hates ghosts all his weaponry is ghost-touch, good to know for later)\n\nwe go down the right hallway the wisps came from and pile out into a huge room full of rubble, I detect magic and am almost blinded from all the magic in the area... with that the whole room shifts, and we see some little lizard like creatures with huge glowing blue eyes darting about. \n\nwe fill them with arrows and swords and various spells, slowly taking them down 1 by 1.... by the way they shoot laser death beams from their eyes, needing a fort save if it hits..... pretty sure its save or die... the valk gets hit, fails the fort save! but the gm determines the eidolon took the brunt of the blow and the valk/summoner is unconscious at -1 hp, Salad runs over and uses a wand of cure moderate wounds to bring them back and they retreat behind the skele-wall and the paladin, we finish the fight pretty quickly after that, the Valk using haste and battlecry to boost everyone's abilities, wiping out the lazer lizards.\n\nThen the room shifts again, its clean an empty save for a giant Buddha statue that stands up ponderously and lowers one hand to the ground, a dark figure walks out, slowly clapping and leaving fading black footprints behind.... ITS THE ASPECT OF EVIL!\nSalad- being evil- and him get along rather well, they discuss how he guards the place now keeping anyone out unless they can beat his traps, and creatures, and he has one more! rawrrr a giant aberration appears! the paladin is really excited... this is basically his specialty, the party says why not and just buffs him to high hell and watches as he annihilates a huge size aberration in like 2 turns (he crit 3 times....)\n\nWe talk to the aspect again...The party seeing this as better than any traps we could leave decide he can stay for now. He offers to take us to the gate itself... we agree, for totally unselfi.... naw Salad totally wants to go through it.\n\nHe takes us out of the caves, to one of the Buddha statues on the front, shifts one leg, dispels an illusion and lets us in to a cavern below (the whole earlier bit was just a red herring I guess) The gate looked different to everyone, to Salad it looked like a simple garden gate (backstory stuff, maybe Ill post his full backstory sometime)  and approaching it he feels the weight of all his years press down upon him, his long life, his hard decisions, he exits the gate and this is what he sees. Kalden the inquisitor who arrived just before the aberration fight looks frightened but unchanged, he did not enter the gate, The Valkyrie has returned the same as she entered, the ultimate success in the eyes of the old caretakers,  Micheal the paladin has a simple cloth covering his eyes, when he lifts his blindfold his eyes are a brilliant white glow, and he sees all that is lawful, with the blindfold down he sees normally through it. Salad has become aged, with a long beard and wrinkles benefiting his age, however he moves with the speed and strength of a younger man. I have to double check but I think Im immune to magical aging effects now. anyways we finish at the gate, bid the aspect of evil a farewell and set out towards Beijing and the imperial palace. \n\npart 5 is coming super soon, basically as soon as I write it up!",

        "text": "Little context before I get started. The PC's work for a global organization known as O.P.S.S.F. under an immortal human known as Commissioner Eagle. The existence of magic on earth originated when an alternate dimension, Czarowayne had portals open up connecting the two worlds. Magic and beasts spilled forward, leading to the creation of a lot of mythological creatures. Czarowayne is still a realm full of Elves, under 3 main kingdoms. (Bartr, Dikstra and Zalgo) The current king of Dikstra, Melogroban is making plans to invade earth. His daughter Elidybea has had experiences with Eagle in the past making the two of them close like a father daughter sort of relationship, however us players don't know why or how they reached that point yet. \n\n\nOur PC's in this tale are my own character Julius, a Greek Half Giant who desires a warrior's death to enter Valhalla. Ivan, the Alaskan Siberian Husky psychic who helps ground our group and be more comedic. Next up is Jeremiah, a Vampire who was turned during the civil war and became a cop because he had nothing better to do. Finally is Sheamus, the Irish Werewolf who is following in his late father's footsteps. (The players for Jeremiah and Sheamus don't care much for roleplaying and are instead here for just hanging out with friends and the crazy stuff that happens. Jeremiah's player specifically does everything he can to avoid roleplaying.)\n\n\nWe went into Eagle's office and received our orders. Meet up with an O.P.S.S.F. branch in Zalgo and rendezvous with two elves. Dee, an ex slave and Soka an actor. They told us how the war between the three kingdoms was coming to the yearly stand-down where they celebrate and have a ball. (Basically the Tet Holiday cease fire thing.) Soka gave each of us magical rings that made us appear to be elves. Being that Julius was a half giant, he could only masquerade as a Dikstran High Elf. Ivan took the form of the elves type of dog like creature. \n\n\nOur goal was to have two people keep people distracted in the ballroom, while the other four found the war room and stole the invasion plans. Julius and Soka decided to stay behind while Ivan, Dee, Jeremiah and Sheamus were going to sneak off.\n\n\nSo while the party was starting, Jeremiah and Sheamus rendezvoused with Zos, an elven slave who was going to cause a distraction so that our infiltration group could get away without being noticed. Ivan stayed by Dee's side the entire time keeping people from dancing with her. Julius met a fellow Warrior Caste Elf (Zirieal) named Zatrakan. Zatrakan was well enough known by the rest of the guests, that sticking by him was a good idea. \n\n\n\nSo when the first large meal of the night was brought out (a cake) and Melogroban was about to cut it, Zos pushed the table it was on onto the king. Melogroban became infuriated and slaughtered the slave in front of the entire ball. The infiltration team snuck away and started working through the cellar. \n\n\nAfter an hour and a half IRL sneaking through the first quarter of the first room, the dm pushed the narrative back to Julius. Ever since the cake fiasco Julius and Zatrakan were just talking, joking up a storm and provoking each other. Melogroban came back and asked if we had seen Princess Elidybea anywhere. We hadn't, but Julius piped up and offered to help look for her. The King accepted the offer of help, and they walked with him to the Princess' chambers. \n\n\nIt was at this point Julius mentioned this was his first time at the annual ball. That was a flounder and he had to bluff his way out of it by saying he had a weak heart from a battle he fought several hundred years ago. Thankfully I rolled high enough to succeed. We hadn't found the Princess yet, so Melogroban gave us two potential area's she could be located. (Rose Garden and the Servant's Quarters) Zatrakan took the Rose Garden while Julius took the Servant's Quarters. \n\n\nOnce in the Servant Quarter's, Julius asked the first slave he came across if they saw the Princess recently. I can't remember exactly how I worded it, but I asked the servant to put me in the direction of the Princess. Successful charisma roll, and I was told that she was heading to the cellar. Just where my allies were. From this slave, Julius was also told two important phrases in this castle to insure that the guards know I'm one of them. Adriantue a formal Elven greeting, as well as Gongway which means \"Order's from the king\".\n\n\nSo Julius rushed to the cellar and reached it around the same time Elidybea did. She was frightened when she saw Julius, thinking she was just another Ziriel looking for her. So Julius quickly removed the ring for a second and revealed his form. She was relieved at this point, because she realized that I was with O.P.S.S.F. which she was intending to rendezvous with. She gave Julius a necklace with a portal stone set to go straight back to Eagle's office and told him to do whatever it takes to get the invasion plans back. Julius told her that unless it was absolutely necessary to use the necklace, that he would return it to the Rose Garden. Julius then cracked a smile and told her to prepare for the best game of hide and seek she would ever play. \n\n\nAfter the Princess had ran off for about a minute, Julius came into the back entrance of the room his allies were in. \"Adriantue! Gongway, the Princess is missing. You've been tasked by his Majesty to find her. Captain Zatrakan is leading the search and I've been instructed to protect the cellar in your place. If you doubt my skill, you may challenge me to one on one combat.\" One of the guards did try to fight me, but he was quickly beat down. \n\n\nMeeting back up with my party was glorious. The code to meet our spy was \"How's the drinks here?\" with the response \"It taste's like shoewater.\" \n\n\nJulius and Ivan walked up to the War Room and knocked on the door. \"Adriantue, Gongway! I have orders to help guard this location. Bartr and Zalgonian guests have been seen snooping around.\" Ivan used his psychic powers to help convince the guard that he had heard about this orders already, guaranteeing the two of us a way in. Julius walked up to the war table where four of the eight elves were located and asked how the drinks were. Pretty generic answers came from the first three, but the last one to answer was our mole.\n\n\nHe gave us the scroll under instructions to deliver it, and made Julius swear under Pravanah (The Elven God figure) that it would get delivered safely. Julius agreed and left the room. He tucked the invasion plans into Ivan's doggy jacket and was about to start heading back to the party to leave the necklace while Ivan and the others fled the palace. But Melogroban came up and questioned why Julius was in this area and not looking for the Princess. Julius came up with the lie that he had nearly caught the Princess, but she disappeared into some secret area's he didn't know how to enter. So he went to the cellar and asked the Zirieal that work there normally to assist in looking for her. (Dee, Sheamus and Jeremiah were all hiding nearby, but were still in sight of Melogroban.)\n\n\nMelogroban noticed the note on Ivan's jacket and picked it up. He questioned what it was, but an answer about it being a letter from a mistress lead to the king opening it up anyways. That was when the gig was up. He called for guards, and Dee came jumping from the shadows and impaled his arms with her sword to get him to drop the plans. Julius quickly grabbed it and yelled to his allies to grab hold of him, and then he activated the portal stone warping back to Eagle. \n\n\nWe summarized the events to Eagle, and then told him about how Dee probably scarred the King. She got promoted up to Lieutenant and transferred to our branch as a permanent NPC that we can call upon. We got paid a pretty decent chunk, and successfully accomplished our first ever stealth mission. \n\n\n\nAll in all it was more fun then the previous week where we helped bring Loki back to prison, but not as much fun as when we had a session dealing with the ancestors of a previous character of mine who were all monster hunters. (I'm more partial to roleplay then combat encounters, so it was just a great deal of fun all around.)\n\n\nThe invasion plot hook is set to start in about 2 months real time. We only got the plans so we know exactly where the invasions will come through so hopefully we can launch an offensive first.",

        "text": "Now, there's a meme circulating depicting the progress of many games. They start out as heroic questers pursuing justice, and eventually devolve into comedy. Things get taken less serious session by session, until eventually the game is an absolute parody of itself. Some games manage to maintain their serious high-stakes tone throughout the whole duration, ending just as they start. These are fairly rare, because human nature is what it is, and because self-control is a limited resource. Occasionally, however, there is a game that goes the other way. They start with the intent of being silly and whimsical, but as the players progress, they begin to genuinely care. By the end, the players are emotionally invested, and role-playing their hearts out. This transformation is a truly beautiful one, and as rare as diamonds in a pig trough.\n\nNow, Reddit, let me present you with one of those stories: Darths and Droids. A bunch of nerds in Australia decide to treat The Phantom Menace as an RPG, to explain why the movies ended up the way they did. However, as the story progresses, it grows from a joke into a genuine story. The characters, both players and PCs alike, genuinely develop and interact and grow. The GM explains why things happen the way they do in the movie, and it actually makes sense. The story develops into something not only comprehensible, but actually good. Darths and Droids is a truly incredible webcomic, and I cannot praise it highly enough. \n\nhttp://darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html",

        "text": "Way back when during 4th edition 40k, I had been playing for a good bit, and I knew most of the players at my friendly local gaming store. As an FLGS and not an official GW, tournaments were usually informal affairs - but once a year we'd get in touch with GW for prize support and run an official Rogue Trader tournament. This usually caused every single one of the most hyper-competitive, pull-no-punches, eyes-on-the-prize players to crawl out of the woodwork. Now some of these were actually decent guys most of the time, and some of them were actually still fun to play against, but none of them brought anything less than their A-game and they were brutally efficient in listbuilding and play. These heavyweights were always the top of the leaderboard in *every* tournament, and one of them had been the winner of every tournament for several years.\n\nAt this time a Rogue Trader was a couple weeks away, and when I walked in on game night, most of the tables in the store were occupied by people practicing. I wandered around, talked to some folks and managed to talk a friend and another guy into sharing the last remaining table for a three way game, even knowing that three way games almost always devolve into 2v1 before reverting into a standard game. We plonked our stuff down on the table to claim it and then ran off to grab some food. As I left, I noticed two of the biggest heavyweights unpacking their Tau and Tyranid armies on a table behind ours. 'Oh snap.' I thought to myself. 'That's a preview of the end of the Rogue Trader, I'm sure.'\n\nWe grab our food and eat while unpacking our armies, hashing out some ad-hoc 3-way rules and beginning to deploy. As we are set to begin the first turn I hear an argument start at the table behind us.\n\n“But you can't place the blast marker there – you have to center it.” says the Tyranid player, a normally jolly middle-aged man on the heavier side.\n\n“No I don't – it just says over your base.” Replies the Tau player, a tall and broad college student.\n\n“No, it says center it over the base.\"\n\n“Where? Rules just say over.”\n\n“Right here, rules summary on resolving blast templates.”\n\n\"That's a summary! It's not the rules.\"\n\nThe heavyweights are arguing over Blast rules, and doing so most vociferously.\n\nWe continue on and start our game. We play the first turn and it's all fairly rote. At the end of the first turn the argument behind us wraps up and the heavyweights agree to reset to deployment and change how they deployed since they each deployed based on their differing ideas of how blasts would function. Our game continues without a hitch, and I'm pleasantly surprised on how balanced our game is turning out, with no ganging up, instead all three of us are probing and keeping forces in reserve, hitting each other more or less equally, and nobody is taking staggering losses or ganging up.  We're well into turn three when I hear it. Another argument has started behind us.\n\n“But you can't take them as casualties. You can't see them, so they're not eligible.” protests Tyranid-dude.\n\n“I hit them with a blast – that doesn't matter.” cries Tau-guy.\n\n“Yes it does, you need LOS to be able to inflict casualties. You can only hurt the Carnifex, not the Warriors.”\n\n\"If it's under a blast it doesn't matter!\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you can target the unit, but you can't even *see* the unit!\"\n\nThis argument continues for some time. With several breaks taken for checking rulebooks and cross referencing rules. Meanwhile we continue our game, with my friend being eliminated in Turn 5 and myself losing the game by elimination of all my forces in Turn 6. It's a very satisfying three way game that didn't end in 4 turns and all three of us are pretty happy about it. My friend and I turn back to the game behind us... which has a rather astounding number of models on the board for a game that's been going on this long. I after packing up my army I waltz over. At this point it's been three and a half, four hours since I entered the store.\n\n\"Hey guys.\"\n\n\"Hey Dakka.\" They both reply.\n\nI survey the board. There's hardly any casualty piles on the sides, and the armies are pretty close to deployment zones. I keep my tone casual as I ask, \"What turn are you guys on?\"\n\nThey reply in stereo: \"First turn.\" ",

        "text": "**He is risen!**\n\n*When last we left off, my blatant (but still undiscovered) rip-off of Jesus Christ had unwittingly been infected with evil magic. A twist no one saw coming--except for Orcbro the DM, who probably wanted to take my sanctimonious self-sacrificing character down a peg. But the joke's on him, as G. Zuss takes on the sins of the world in this next installment of* ***Jesus plays Pathfinder!***\n\n---\n\n#Deliver Us from Evil\n\nIt is written...you shall not tempt the lord your God. \n\n*Get behind me, amulet of necromancy.*\n\nIt’s times like these that you remember why you created a Will save of +12. \n\nGabbatha Zuss did not instantly succumb to the evil power contained in the amulet and its seven glowing stones. Instead, he stumbled into the bloodstained church and took out his Boundary Chalk, drawing one line across the threshold and another in a tight circle around the amulet. That might protect us. For now.\n\nThe rest of the party was already inside, searching for clues and for any survivors. The church was ordinarily a rustic but elegant place of worship, with wooden pews and a golden chalice set upon a pulpit at the back. But now the place was filled with blood and bodies. Half of the town had been dragged out and transformed into undead. The other half had been hacked to pieces or committed suicide. It was a grisly sight, and Zuss could barely keep his gorge down. \n\nA child began crying from underneath a pile of bodies. Zuss rushed over to help and got a chunk of skin bitten off for his trouble. One of the other party members quickly ended the young zombie’s existence. Zuss nursed his wound. It wasn’t infected, thank Dad. \n\nPerhaps something in this church could help clean this scourge. Zuss approached the pulpit and examined the golden chalice--filled with red wine and studded with red and blue gems. A cursory knowledge of local religion let him know that it was a common rite of the church of Mitra to share wine from a chalice like this. Strangely, though, the symbol of Mitra had been carved over with another--a star being eaten by a black maw. The symbol of an obscure cult that worshipped a dark god named Rajuk Amon-Gore. \n\n“Wine like zat can onlee be found in Magistreux,” Arlin interjected, sniffing the air. “Come on, let us go upstairs.”\n\nStill struggling with the implications of this perverted sacrament, and the evil that had made a foothold in his own heart, Zuss followed. \n\nPerhaps a little too slowly. When he reached the attic, Arlin was already struggling to save two children from a one-armed zombie slowly clawing their way toward them. \n\nOrcbro, our DM, admitted that these kids were originally going to be already dead, but since we rushed so hard to reach this town, we had a chance to save them yet. Filled with determination, Zuss summoned positive energy to snuff out this undead’s animating force. \n\nA sickly green glow emanated from the cleric. The children screamed and cowered behind Arlin as the zombie’s rotting flesh reknit itself. Zuss stared at his hands, still steaming with the negative energy he had just channeled. \n\n“W-What?”\n\nFor once, I didn’t have a snappy Biblical one-liner. Orcbro had taken my entire character and turned him on his head. \n\nArlin slashed at the zombie over and over, his task made more difficult by the energies sustaining it. Finally, though, it crashed to the ground. \n\n“Do you haff anysing to tell us, clerick?” Arlin sniped, hands protectively on the children. \n\n“...What can I say?” I said finally. “I blessed those who cursed me.”\n\nThe sound of my own stifled snickers were thankfully drowned out by an ominous creaking described by Orcbro. The party ran downstairs to look out of the windows and saw thousands of thorny vines rising up out of the forest, encroaching upon the church. \n\nIt was time to go. \n\nThe thorns homed in on the place like a magnet, drawn perhaps by the burst of negative energy. Creepers moved up the sides of the walls, feeling for cracks in the masonry, searching out the windows. The vines piled up against the Boundary Chalk line across the door, but it was only a matter of time before they muscled through it. \n\n(Since it was just me and DMbro as Arlin left at the table at this point, it was assumed that Perry and Prezzel found their own way out, possibly using Potions of Flight. It was down to the two of us to get out safely and save the kids.)\n\nZuss’s plan was simple. Cast Air Walk on Arlin, Arlin carries the children out safely, G. Zuss stays behind to try to hold the vines at bay. Arlin would have none of that, however. \n\n“Do not use yerr magick heer, clerick! Deed you not zee vat happened earlier?”\n\nWith a Bluff of 31, I couldn’t argue. \n\n“Fine, I guess we both have to stay.”\n\nArlin facepalmed. Rebluff. \n\n“Ah mean, you cannot use eet on ozzers! Yerr fine to cast eet on yerrself!”\n\nAgain, I couldn’t argue--He had Bluff out the wazoo.\n\nArlin propped a pew up against the wall and used Expeditious Retreat to parkour his way up the makeshift ramp and onto a rafter. \n\n“Now take the kids!”\n\nZuss scooped one up in each arm and began to ascend, the floor flooding with vines directly underneath them. They made it out of the church window and began running in midair toward the edge of town--with any luck, the curse hadn’t spread that far yet. \n\nArlin, in the meantime, began leaping and rolling from rooftop to rooftop, passing impossible checks each time. The vines rolled higher and higher, swallowing the church entirely and nipping at his heels. Finally, Arlin missed a check of 45--by one. He soared through the air, smacking against the side of the roof with an audible thud, and falling into the vines below with a cry. \n\nMeanwhile, Zuss’s Strength and Dexterity score of 11 and 9, respectively, was starting to catch up with him. The girl was slipping from my grasp, and would have fallen into the sea of thorns 50 feet below, had I not burned a Hero Point to redouble my grip with the determination to save the children. As it was, we barely made it back to the edge of the forest before the last of the spell wore off and we floated back down to the ground. \n\nArlin was waiting for us, covered in tiny scratches. \n\n“...Let’s get out of heer, clerick.”\n\nWe rode hard, nearly collapsing the entire way, until we finally literally fell into our camp and passed out. \n\nWe awoke to G. Zuss’s disciples in our camp, having received the bird-message. They had begun to care for the shellshocked children already, and were merely awaiting further instructions from their fearless leader. \n\nGabbatha Zuss went off into the garden to pray. Now more than ever, he needed guidance, and an Augury from Sarenrae would go a long way. Zuss only had enough materials to perform it once, so he couldn’t ask about the amulet or the state of his soul, only where to go to bring these people to safety. \n\nBut Sarenrae was silent. \n\n---\n\nZuss returned to his people disheartened. Arlin had another suggestion, however. \n\n“Fort Priare--it's three days’ ride from heer. They may not haff room...but eet is safer zan zee woods right now.”\n\nAnd so, Gabbatha, Arlin, and the Chosen People set out to wander for a home again. \n\nWhen we all arrived at the fort, there was a lot of flashing of badges and accusations of sabotage before Arlin could explain the whole situation to the guardsmen. He mercifully left out the part about Zuss’s “infection.”\n\nEqually encouraging was the fact that there was a priest stationed at a church within the fort--an ancient elf with knotted hair and tribal tattoos named Velintari. Instantly, the priest was able to sense that there was something wrong with my aura. I showed him the amulet I had snatched up before our flight from the town. \n\n“Elendari--\" he said, brow furrowing. \"I have not seen this for a long time...”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Your soul--it has been bound to a...phylactery. You have become a vessel for a powerful force of darkness. This...pendant...there are seven. Each of them bound to the wielder of an artifact known as the Brace of Elendari. A long time ago, my ancestors were slain by barbarians exploiting its terrible power--as long as the seven live, the bearer of the Brace of Elendari is indestructible. You...are one of the seven now.”\n\n“Is there any way to release its grip upon me?”\n\n“There is a ceremony. Meet me back here in three days. Make preparations as you will, feel free to have your friends as witnesses. I will do my best to help you when the time comes.”\n\n---\n\n#Fishers of Men\n\nZuss, once again, had three days to kill. \n\nThe first night, he found Arlin getting sloshed at the local inn--already far enough gone to think that whipping out an old lute and playing a folk song was a great idea. To everyone’s surprise, not only was the lute of superb quality, but the song was too. Admist a shower of coppers and revelry, Arlin offered Zuss a drink. He accepted--Zuss loves wine, after all. \n“Leezen, my friend,” Arlin slurred. “Zat beezness back zerr wiz ze cherch...eet could haff gone a lot worse. I thank you.” Arin’s unfocused eyes became clear for a moment. “...Thomas, thanks you.”\n\nZuss raised an eyebrow. “Thomas?”\n\nBut Arlin’s party face was back on. “Nuzzing, nuzzing! Come and drink, everyone! Eet’s all on me! Ladies!! How about you...and you!”\n\nNothing, eh? I doubt it, Thomas.\n\nMeanwhile, Arlin rolled against a DC20 for a three-way. He scored. All three nights. \n\n---\n\nThe second day approached, and this time Zuss found himself outdoors. Prezzel the fisherman remembered his roots and took to the river, while Zuss accompanied him for some light conversation. \n\n“You ever consider taking up a hobby like fishing, cleric?” Prezzel grunted, flicking the line out once more. \n\n“Often.” I restrained a giggle. “But I consider myself to be more of a fisher of men.”\n\nPrezzel grunted.\n\n“What about you? Have any of the gods ever called your name in your sleep?”\n\n“Nah. I’m not the superstitious type. I don’t care what your reasons are for doing whatever insanity you’re doing. But I’m in it for the money. And for my family. But, mostly for the money.”\n\n“Ahh. My father is far away. So I made my own family.” I gestured broadly toward the congregation of refugees huddled en masse within the fortress. “But what will you do when the money runs out?”\n\n“I guess return to my family,” Prezzel shrugged, eying the bobber.\n\n“Why not make a family here? With us?”\n\nPrezzel looked up and laughed awkwardly, realizing what Zuss was proposing. \n “Hah! Sorry, cleric. I’m not the superstitious type. And even if I were, I find more reasons not to be every day.”\n\n“Sorry?”\n\n“Your...condition.” Prezzel flicked his eyes over Zuss’s evil-infected body. “Did your god allow that to happen?”\n\nThat was an armor-piercing question if ever there was one. In-character and out-of-character, I had never thought up a satisfactory answer to that philosophical conundrum. I fumbled briefly, eyes downcast. \n\n“All fall short of the glory. We are but flesh.” I said finally. \n\n“So it seems,” Prezzel said, rolling his eyes. \n\nNo men were caught that day. But some questions were baited that wouldn’t be answered till much later. \n\nOut of character, Prezzel’s player broke into laughter and asked me what my endgame for Zuss was, because it would be amazing if he started a religion and became a firebrand preacher, or a god. I nodded and said that was a really good idea. \n\n---\n\nThe third and final day. Zuss had been praying all through the night and morning in the church of Mitra, awaiting the judgment of a god who no longer would speak to him. \n\nHe didn’t hear Arlin sneaking up behind him. But, no one ever does hear Arlin. \n\n“Forgive me, thees must be a trying time for you,” he said.\n\n“No, please, sit,” I gestured to the pew. \n\n“Of course. I merely wondered if you wanted ze company.”\n\n“Now more than ever.”\n\nArlin sat with a grunt. \n\n“Tell me somezing, clerick. I’ve always wondered, why do clericks charge?”\n\n“Charge?”\n\n“Gold. For zerr services.”\n\n“I...don’t know. I never have. I always thought of it as earthly reward for earthly work, and heavenly reward for heavenly work. I don’t need to collect things. Sarenrae provides.”\n\nArlin chuckled. \n\n“I wish more of ze religious type shared zat sentiment. More gold for me. But I suppose you’re always trying to raise tribute for your god, eh?”\n\n“Some do. But in my opinion, the people are more important than the god.”\n\nArlin looked around and raised his eyebrows.\n\n“You do realize you are in a cherch, right?”\n\nI laughed. “Yes, I know. But think about it. Gods don’t change our world. People do. Out of our free will.”\n\n“Still zounds zacreligious.”\n\n“Think about it. There have been people who have done terrible things in the name of a good god. And there have been people who have done many righteous deeds without a god to claim. In our world, we are granted boons for our faith, of course, but our actions? Those are wholly ours. It matters much less who you serve, than what you do with that servitude.”\n\nArlin scoffed.  \n“You are ze strangest clerick I haff effer known. Let us hope Sarenrae finds favor with your opinion.”\n\nI turned around and saw Velintari enter, draped in ceremonial robes. It was time. \n\n#Drink In Remembrance of Me\n\nThe party, having nothing better to do that day, had shown up to watch the purifying ritual. Zuss’s followers were there too, but the exact nature of the ceremony had been left vague for them. \n\n“If you are ready,” Velintari pronounced. \n\nZuss stood and approached the pulpit. Velintari nodded and indicated for Zuss to set the accursed pendant into the church’s chalice. Once placed, Velintari filled the goblet with wine, covering the pendant. \n\n“It will wash away the evil,” he said. “Simply drink, and you will be saved.”\n\nHe began to whisper a prayer as I lifted the cup to my lips. \n\nAt this point, Orcbro was giving me several chances to roll perception. I was botching all of them, until the last second. \n\nEtched into the side of the cup was a symbol that rang a bell. A star being eaten by a black maw. \n\nArlin could instantly tell that something was wrong by the way I was hesitating. He crept up to make a distraction, but Velintari’s head whipped around. \n\n“Get back, you fool!” he snapped. “You’ll ruin everything!”\n\nAny doubts I had were confirmed when a priest called a man a fool in anger. \n\n“It is written,” I said slowly, “that this is to be a house of worship. But you have turned it into a den of evil!”\n\nI threw the cup to the ground where it shattered. It had been filled with blood. \n\nVelintari’s eyes burned, but a smile crept across his face. \n\nSimultaneously, all the shutters to the church’s windows fell. A female figure with glowing red eyes peeled away from the shadows. The party jumped to their feet, but a wall of ice rose up from the floor and cut them off with a slam. \n\n“Everything you are, everything you stand for...” the dark priest pronounced. “It belongs to me now.”\n\nAs he walked toward me, the sleeve of his robe slipped back. A Brace, glowing green. \n\n“You wanted to save the people outside? I shall turn you into their destruction.”\n\nPanicked, I cast Protection from Evil as I back up into the wall of ice. On the other side, I can feel something pounding away at the barrier, but not fast enough. \n\nThe female vampire pounced, slamming me into the ice and throwing me to the ground to knock me out. I’m screwed. CMB +5 and DEX -2 vs. a save of 25. \n\nI roll a Nat 20. G. Zuss saves. \n\nKhastin has turned herself into an air elemental and squeezed above the wall of ice. Arlin has parkoured into the rafters. Both are above the Lich, ready to come to my rescue--but he has created an Obscuring Mist around all of us. Without a clear line of sight, both are helpless to use their attacks. \n\nThe she-vampire tackles me once again. This time I fail. Losing the Fortitude save, I am rendered paralyzed. Nothing but outside help can rescue me--and help isn’t coming. \n\nLicking her slavering jaws, the vampire bites down on my neck. \n\nThe last of my HP quickly drains away. \n\nThe last thing I see is Velintari, the Lich, vanishing into the darkness. \n\nThe darkness consumes my vision as well, and I am no more. \n\n##To be continued\n\n##[Previous Installment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5k7dz2/jesus_plays_pathfinder_part_3/)\n",

        "text": "TL;DR - I one-shotted a general and within five seconds, won a match I should have lost.  Also, Shogun 2 is awesome.)\n\nIt's been a few years, so some details are a little hazy, but this ended up being one of the most broken matches I had ever played.\n\nI had been playing Shogun 2 since launch as a college kid, spending a couple hundred hours in total when class wasn't in session.  I rarely went above normal difficulty, since higher difficulties would have my ass beat within the first 10 turns.  I never really set out to \"git gud\". Still, I became completely enthralled with the visuals and the mechanics of the game.  \n\nFor metaphorical context, Shogun 2 is a game of rock/paper/scissors, where it's possible to have paper beat scissors depending on your origami skills.  You had light spear units that were pretty much useless yet could decimate upgraded cavalry if utilized and positioned right.  Gunpowder units had the potential to demoralize the enemy and cause massive damage, but were incredibly weak in hand-to-hand.  Having a good mix of melee/ranged/cavalry/anti-cavalry was critical to winning a bout.  Some aspects were a bit broken in single-player though, and those elements translating over to multiplayer led to the reason for this post.\n\nIt was a siege-map, where I was defending.  It was an upgraded keep: a castle surrounded by two tiers of walls.  I had my set up of samurai archers on the outer wall for the initial volleys, katana samurai to hold off any soldiers that managed to break into the courtyards, and my prized possession: one squadron of flintlock samurai.  Now, this was before one of the later patches that completely nerfed firearms, so these units were way more accurate than they had any right to be.  Seriously, if I could command them to shoot a butterfly's ass 30 yards away, I wouldn't be surprised if they did it.  My opponent was pretty well balanced, with his only general flanked by two-to-three cavalry units.  His force was way larger than mine, but that was typically how sieges went.  With our units picked and positioned, the match began.\n\nIt started like all sieges do: his forces approached while I casually drank my coffee, alt-tabbed, and browsed reddit.  It usually takes about two minutes before an opponent reaches the walls; there was time.  I must have been reading something good because when I came back, one of my gates was on fire and about to collapse.\n\nWhen you're besieging, you have two options while under the constant barrage of ranged fire: have your units scale the stone walls, suffering some fall casualties, or damage one of the gates enough to have it explode, creating an opening into which you can now enter the keep freely.  My opponent, seeing that my archers were facing the complete opposite direction, decided on the latter option, taking no damage and basically getting free access to attack my units from behind.\n\nIn a panic, I clicked desperately to pull my archers off and get them to the inner courtyard, but it was too late; those poor bastards were exposed with the now-destroyed gate, and they were the bulk of my army.  My opponent, seeing my archers begin to pull off the walls in a sprint towards the safety of the inner courtyard, immediately poured his cavalry into the opening of the destroyed gate.  I imagine he was looking as smug as his General who headed the triumphant cavalcade, thinking the match was another Glorious Victory under his belt.\n\nI imagine he was still grinning when the first bullet my samurai shot lodged itself directly into his only General's skull, killing him instantly. \n\nSee, nowadays, flintlock units have been nerfed to the point of elite units being lucky to hit the broadside of a barn.  At that point in time, however, my samurai had the high ground, with insane accuracy, with all muzzles pointed directly at that destroyed gate.  Not to be dramatic, but [it looked kind of like this] (https://i.makeagif.com/media/9-24-2015/UzWju8.gif).\n\nWith his general dead in the first five seconds of entering the keep, his army quickly broke rank and ran in shame.  My opponent and I, of course, blew up the chat with all kinds of colorful phrases, like \"fucking broken\", \"bullshit flintlock\", and I was in just as much shock as he was.  It took a few minutes for me come to terms with the fact that I had ended a match in two seconds like Ronda Rousey did for anyone that wasn't Holly Holms.\n\nI have had few matches since then that gave me that level of cheap pleasure; I haven't found an outlet to share this story with until I found /r/gametales this morning, so here I am.

        "text": "The characters:\n\nVex, the Chaotic Neutral hunter with a snake companion. He's a heavy alcoholic with connections to shady criminal types, and is only in the city for shits and giggles.\n\nSibbi, the Chaotic Neutral investigator, who for reasons far too complicated to explain here needed to acquire a platypus to create a powerful magical dagger. She had contracted to buy said platypus from one of Vex's criminal contacts in the city, but didn't have enough money and would probably be murdered if she backed out of the deal.\n\nElbrus, the Neutral Evil oracle of Cthulhu. Quite insane, but still clever. Has the (hidden) goal of eventually becoming a lich, and has convinced himself killing an orphan child will somehow further that goal.\n\nUzra, Lawful Good paladin of Sarenrae. Unlike most paladins, is permitted to consort with evil companions so long as she is making an effort to redeem them and steer them towards the light, or when such association serves a clear greater good. She's the only reason the party stays focused on preventing the apocalypse instead of preventing the nearest brothel from not being set on fire.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe story begins with the party having just secured a tenuous alliance with a powerful, rather evil wizard to gain assistance against a world-ending threat. The wizard, a skilled enchanter, offers to improve the party's equipment in exchange for keepsakes or things of personal value. They all agree, but Uzra lives the life of an aesthetic and has no possessions to sacrifice. The wizard offers to perform the enchanting in exchange for a particular book from the library of Uzra's paladin order. She agrees, and departs to fetch the book, leaving the rest of the party to their own devices.\n\nVex immediately goes to to the nearest bar and starts challenging everyone to a drinking contest. As in, literally challenges every single bar patron, one after the next, drinking them all under the table thanks to a magic ring that prevents alcohol poisoning.\n\nSibbi, meanwhile, decides the best person to help her get that platypus is the insane, unstable follower of an Old God, and offers Elbrus \"any possible service\" in exchange for him acquiring the platypus. Elbrus, true to form, demands the procurement of an innocent orphan boy. Sibbi, in a rare flash of brilliance, declares orphans are hard to get but that she'll \"definitely be able to get two or three kids from somewhere.\" Hands are shaken, the deal is made, and they both immediately try to screw the other one over as hard as possible.\n\nElbrus goes directly to Vex, who is now quite sloshed, and demands to know \"where the hell the man with the furry duck went.\" A meeting is arranged, and Elbrus tells the man that Sibbi won't be able to pay and that he, Elbrus, needs the platypus to lure Sibbi into a life of slavery. Somehow, the man is convinced, and sells Elbrus the platypus for a fraction of its value. Elbrus returns to the evil wizard and has him draft a magical contract that would, in exchange for ownership of the platypus, compel Sibbi to perform one service for Elbrus, to be named at a later date. Just to be a dick, the contract also demanded a payment of 2000 gold, knowing Sibbi was completely broke due to an unrelated incident with a pyramid scheme.\n\nWhile this is going on, Sibbi went out, stole three baby goats (get it? Kids?) and persuaded the innkeeper to let her store them in Elbrus's room. She returns to the home of the evil wizard only to be met with Elbrus, with a magically binding contract demanding, in precise wording, \"2000 gold and one or more kids.\" Sibbi signs the contract, stores the platypus away, and goes out to find the only person who would possibly loan her stupid amounts of money on short notice: Vex.\n\nBy the time she arrives at the bar, Vex is about as sloshed as is possible. She drags him, cursing and kicking, back to the wizard, and demands that they work out something she could give Vex in fair exchange for 2000 gold. When asked what he wanted, Vex screams \"YOUR OVARIES!\" and falls over. Sibbi, for some unknown, idiotic reason, convinces the wizard that Vex's drunken exclamation counts as verbal agreement to that particular deal, and signs a magical, binding contract trading her literal ovaries for 2000 gold. The wizard agrees to remove them magically, but demands it be done without anesthetic. Sibbi, in a show of idiotic defiance, drinks a poison that puts her into a coma. \n\nElbrus, meanwhile, wandered back to his room at the inn. Finding the kids, and realizing he's been had, he tears the head off one of the goats in a fit of anger and storms out, bringing the goat head with him. When he gets to the wizard's house, he finds Sibbi in a coma on the floor, bleeding profusely, and Vex drunkenly juggling a pair of ovaries, with the wizard nowhere to be seen. Elbrus carefully ties Sibbi up, takes the 2000 gold from Vex, magically awakens her, roughly informs her that the contractual service she must perform is to acquire an actual human child, and starts beating her with the goat head while screaming about loyalty and justice and fair play. Vex, still as drunk as is physically possible without death, jumps up and starts joining in, still holding the ovaries.\n\nUzra, who had a lovely time at the library, walks in at this moment. One party member is tied up and bleeding through two holes in her abdomen while the other two are beating her with a goat head and her own ovaries. As the Paladin draws her blade to fight this clear depravity, Sibbi looks her in the eye and yells \"I AGREED TO MOST OF THIS!\" before blacking out from nonlethal damage and blood loss.\n\nThe Paladin no longer leaves the party to their own devices.",

        "text": "Many people who have played Skyrim have quickly found that one NPC follower that they absolutely love. For me, it's Lydia. She's a strong, independent Nord woman who could probably kick my ass if she wanted, but obeys me out of duty. Although she remains stoic as a glacier in the face of danger, she is not without warmth or humor. The slight sarcastic lilt in the line \"I am sworn to carry your burdens\" always melts my heart.\n\nFrom a meta-game perspective, I realized long ago that marrying one's companion allows the character to gain the Lover's Comfort perk whenever they sleep. So, this was not the first character that I had marry their companion. It was, however, the first one created specifically for that purpose.\n\nI built Michael to complement Lydia as perfectly as possible. I decided to build a fellow Nord for her, so that she could have a lover from her own homeland. Also, from a metagame perspective, I noted the Nords' racial affinity for light armor and two-handed weapons. Since Lydia used heavy armor, and preferred sword-and-board, this would also allow for a simpler division of equipment. So, I treated this game as my love story to Lydia, and went out of my way to make it happen.\n\nI joined the Companions as soon as possible, rushing through their quests to get to the test. When Farkas goes werewolf mode and rips the Silver Hand a new one, he drops his Skyforge Steel greatsword. He doesn't pick it back up when he turns back to human, either. So, I get a free Skyforge Steel greatsword. This is beneficial for two reasons. First off, it means that I get a great weapon fairly early on. Also, though, it means that, when I join the Companions properly and get my free weapon, I can get a sword for Lydia. \n\nSo, before I join the Companions properly I head down to Riften. I head straight for the Temple of Mara, and hear about how marriage works here in Skyrim. I buy that amulet of Mara without a second thought, but I do not don it yet. I must wait for the right time, when I can in good conscience propose to Lydia.\n\nSo, I head back to Whiterun and take my vows. The Companions welcome me as one of their own, and ask what kind of weapon I want. I think about Lydia, and ask for a normal sword. I've been dumping almost every perk point I get into Enchantment and Smithing, so I make this the most finely-honed and balanced sword the world has ever seen. The, I buy the largest Soul Gem available, give the sword a powerful Fire enchantment, and name it Fidelis. I now have my wedding present for Lydia. \n\nI continue to pursue quests for the Companions and other patrons, saving up every Septim I can. I am still wearing cheap leather armor, but I do not buy a better set. I save up for months, suffering far more than necessary for my frugality. Eventually, I have saved up enough to buy Breezehome, which I passed innumerable times on the way into Whiterun. It wasn't much, but it was mine. With something to finally call my own, I finally had something to share with another. Then and there, in the middle of the living room of my newly-bought house, I took a knee and donned the Amulet of Mara. My heart was thundering, as I took the biggest risk of my life and laid bare my heart. When she said yes, my world shifted. Suddenly, what was mine was ours. My life was no longer my own, but was something I shared with the most incredible woman I had ever met.\n\nWe ran down to Riften without further ado, and scheduled a wedding for the next day. A few of our friends came with, and watched the ceremony. The priestess of Mara led us through our vows, and gave each of us a blessed ring. With it, Mara's blessing would flow more freely, as our healing spells became easier to use. Once the ceremony ended, I gifted her Fidelis. She took off her own sword, and strapped on mine without a second thought. \n\nHowever, I was not done showering my beloved with gifts. I knew that she preferred steel over magic, and that the blessing of Mara would not benefit her as much as it would me. So, I crafted the finest Diamond Gold Ring I could. I spent another irresponsible amount of money on another Grand Soul Gem, and enchanted the ring to strengthen her sword arm. I named it The Power of Love, and traded it to her for the Blessing of Mara ring. She wore my wedding ring for the rest of her days.\n\nWe journeyed onwards, standing firm against the dragons as man and wife. Although their ancient magics were terrible indeed, they paled in comparison to the power of our love. ",

        "text": "Here's one from my friend Josh. \n\n[Previously](http://chroniclesofwayland.blogspot.com/2017/03/a-failure-to-communicate.html)\n\nSo it was the second full session of our massive Kingdom Builder campaign.  I can't remember how many people were in attendance that night, but the number was something you'd expect from an MMO raid scenario, not a Pathfinder game. \n\nThe situation was as follows: we'd quickly decided to leave the frozen lands behind since we figured a tundra wouldn't provide enough food for our population.  Looking back, I think the GM figured we'd hang out for at least a little while, and we were completely blowing his plans.  Oh well, you know what they say about plans and players.  We'd found a guide to take us through some badlands and into a more temperate area where we figured we could settle. \n\nOur travels through the badlands were mainly through choked canyons.  Since I'd rolled my PC with the aim of being General of our kingdom, I encouraged other PCs to join me in scouting along the tops of the canyon walls to watch out for ambush.  We discovered a rockslide had blocked the most direct route through the badlands, and further discovered when we tried to dig through that much of the \"rockslide\" was actually a small group of Earth Elementals that did not like us.  At all.  We tried to fight them, but when Wilk's monk was almost a One-Hit Knock Out (OHKO), we retreated and decided to find another route. \n\nThe PCs I can remember included the following:\n\nMy fighter, Alvir\nStephen's Sorceress, Levy (and the aasimar paladin spouse)\nWilk's Monk, Lo Wang\nBilly's new Cleric of war, Serras\nSteve's Rogue driver, Magnus\nAaron's dwarven Inquisitor, Ovrul\nSammy's elven Ranger, Yvandir\nNolan's Magus, Lyrith\na Svirfneblin monk/rogue/assassin/whatever THING\nA dwarven cleric\nAnother elf, think that was a Ranger too\nWe had a few hundred NPC types with us as well, all strung out down this 20 - 30 ft. wide canyon.  Of course, it was bright daylight when the drow attacked us.  Yes, I know.  Yes, we all went, \"Drow in the middle of the day?  The heck?\"  Oh well.  One fights the battles one is handed.  \n\nIn an effort to provide a balanced challenge to this party of around a dozen 3rd or 4th level PCs, the GM had approximately 20 drow ambush us from the canyon walls.  All semblance of order both in the party and in the Skype call went completely out the window.  Everyone wanted to get into the fight in a manner that showcased their particular build, but everyone got in everyone else's way which led to the heart of this particular post's RPG nightmare.  \n\nPCs were scrambling to the canyon walls to the east and west to engage the closest drow, and many drow were obliging us by jumping down into melee range.  There was a large group of crossbowmen drow to our north some 60-80 feet on the canyon wall peppering us as well.  I remember Ovrul cast Enlarge Person on my fighter and the dwarven cleric cast that on himself as well.  We engaged drow on either side, archers trying to get clear shots while Levy cleverly distracted many of the drow with an illusory archmage in the middle of the group.  \n\nNot many of us were paying attention to the enemy to the north... except Serras.  We didn't know this yet because Billy was hiding it like it was going to be a mind-blowing character revelation, but Serras was completely built around channeling negative energy.  Billy literally envisioned Serras as a walking Fireball of negative energy.  Serras ran up to the north trying to get some drow attention so he could amaze us all with his kill-total.  \n\nMeanwhile we were slowly gaining on the drow from the east and west.  There was a lot of working together to flank and focus down the enemy, trying to keep them from overwhelming our caster types or tearing through the civilian NPCs.  Most of us had taken a few hits which was enough to put 3rd-4th level characters in danger.  The voice chat was chaos with the GM trying to keep order.  \n\nSerras got his wish, the drow started coming after him.  He was taking some hits, and he was alone about 30 ft. from the group.  Everything we were doing to the drow, it looked like the drow were about to do to him.  \n\nLooking back, I realize that I probably should have let natural selection run its course.  When a member of the herd darts away from the group, that's the one the lions eat and the herd is usually the stronger for it, right?  Those that practice good habits survive, the others get culled.  At the time, though, I just knew the cleric of the War God my character also worshiped was getting surrounded by the enemy and about to get killed.  I had Alvir shout some sort of threat about leaving his priest alone and charged in to try and fight him free.  \n\n\"NO DUDE STAY BACK!\" was what I got after I set my token down.  What?  Billy was immediately very upset.  Didn't know why at the time, but it was because I was spoiling his reveal with the negative energy (so edgy!) and perhaps about to kill-steal.  \n\n\"Dude, stay back!  Don't get in my way!\" was what he had to say.  \n\nI couldn't close the distance in one round anyway, but my moving up was enough to divert some drow my way instead of closing on Billy.  He was pretty upset.  The crowning moment, though, was when his initiative came up: because he wanted as many kills as possible, he actually moved south a bit to include more drow... and some of the PCs, my fighter included.  He channeled.  Of course he'd neglected to take the feat that would allow him to exclude persons from the effect.  My fighter failed the save, some of the other PCs did too.  I was at around 3 hp.  Most of the drow saved, so while he hurt some of them it wasn't the massacre for which he'd hoped.  He was also audibly upset that no one was exclaiming about how cool it was that he did damage instead of healing, repeating that his character was doing this a few times.  Instead some of the players were mad that he'd critically wounded some of us while there was still more fighting to do.  \n\n\"I warned you!\" was all he'd give on that.  He was getting swarmed and wanted to blame the rest of the party for trying to save him.  Like I said, should've let nature run its course, even if it would've been the guy's 2nd dead character in as many sessions.  \n\nWe managed to wrap up the fight and take some prisoners.  This started a lot of post-session argument in the group, though, and between that and the chaos over the Skype call we started dropping players pretty quickly.  ",

        "text": "For those just tuning in here's the situation, our group is an irregular unit in the Free Rassalhague Republic roughly 2 lances strong. In the aftermath of the Ronin war we have plenty of combat experience and some seriously powerful mechs and weapons in our inventory, goodness knows why we've been selected to scrape some heavily depleted mercenary units off a backwater planet that doesn't warrant its own defenders. For this operation we are giving the Dragonslayers mercenary unit the heroic last stand they wish for, our unit is as follows.\n\n* The ancient [Highlander](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/b/bf/3050U_Highlander.jpg?timestamp=20100620000008) \"Blackout\" remains at the lead of our force, having emerged from the last battle unharmed. With a gauss rifle and LRM20 providing long range firepower, and an SRM4 and two medium lasers providing short range firepower the jump capable Highlander can engage at any range, allowing it to keep its ECM suite safe.\n* The [Thunderbolt](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/f/f4/3025_thunderbolt.jpg/478px-5z06lhxazmoth7k202w87imm24a2oa8.png?timestamp=20130421084450) \"Viking One\" is also joining us again, its ER large laser and LRM15 offer good long range firepower, while the medium lasers its pilot specializes in allow withering torrents of energy to be drilled into targets at closer ranges, while double heat sinks keep the design ice cold.\n* The [Longbow](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/9/9c/Lgb-12c_longbow.jpg?timestamp=20141107020154) \"Storm\" is repaired and back in the fight, providing rows upon rows of LRMs backed up by medium lasers in a jump capable assault mech.\n* Our one of a kind, heavily modified [Imp](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/2/2e/IMP-1A_Imp.jpg/567px-tgjlywmqckb6ezgs1ie7jpmpbb1nlox.png?timestamp=20120301202502) affectionately known as the [\"Pimp\"](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/262648750747549697/302159071090311168/sketch__imp__pimp__battlemech_by_prdarkfox-dazpf4z.png) is back in action after further modification to install a gauss rifle in place of its PPCs. This frankenstein of an assault mech brings a terrifying number of SRM racks and a massive hatchet to bear alongside the aforementioned gauss rifle.\n* The [Cyclops](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/d/d2/3050U_Cyclops.jpg/748px-0h2yzzz2e2j14vzyyt39fy79ssw2wrx.png?timestamp=20110118184912) returns, armed with a UAC/5, twin PPCs, and a battery of medium lasers the Cyclops lays down an impressive torrent of firepower at long range.\n* The [Banshee](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/5/5e/Banshee_1E.jpg?timestamp=20121111152256) from our last operation has been repaired, modified, dubbed \"Rui Shi\" and is coming along, boasting twin PPCs, twin medium pulse lasers, and several standard medium lasers Rui Shi is not to be taken lightly at any range.\n* The [Marauder](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/b/b2/3025-Marauder-Classics.png?timestamp=20160615211543) we decapitated in the last op is also back on the field with a fresh coat of paint, modified with additional armor, heat sinks, and medium lasers in place of the bulky AC/5, this Marauder, dubbed \"Drake\" is a potent fire support mech.\n* The [Grasshopper](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/5/5a/3050U_Grasshopper.jpg?timestamp=20110118184228), modified to replace the LRM and large laser with a PPC, is also back, rounding out our second lance of mechs.\n\nAs we are preparing to engage the absolute worst happens, a [King Crab](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/8/8e/KGC-0000KINGCRAB.png?timestamp=20110701190410) easily as old as Blackout clambers out of a nearby lake, having been concealed in there until we were closer, the mech has an ace pilot and enough firepower to send any of our mechs to an early grave in seconds if it gets close. This further exacerbates our alarm at the dense jungle we will be fighting in, with dismally poor sight lines and restricted mobility, the King Crab will, well, be king.\n\nBacking the King Crab up is an [Awesome](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/e/e8/3025_Awesome1.jpg/504px-fjxi6d0jbd1bxsfto6sd9wvhmtyey16.png?timestamp=20130421090520), [Warhammer](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/8/8a/3025-Warhammer-Classics.png/578px-l0q0t8aw4uy2cppjz1c13feul5vq2vb.png?timestamp=20160615210553), [Shadow Hawk](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/d/da/3025-ShadowHawk-Classics.png/540px-5299p6kph940b38jf5qlbdod4vdgcs5.png?timestamp=20160615212121), [Archer](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/5/51/3025_archer.jpg/406px-fuvpfk4v9c6nyw9yf8zrr96u5cqrmf7.png?timestamp=20130421094939), [Rifleman](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/a/a6/3025_Rifleman.jpg/442px-r52j4s7mufrue3p10lajvlh8q43r8ez.png?timestamp=20130421094643), [Flashman](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/9/96/FLS-Flashman.png/439px-94btuljz8y14kvuceixfvwlxekezj3u.png?timestamp=20110723200955), [Hunchback](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/0/05/HBK-Hunchback.png/402px-5yyg9nsd2g0vdnecspwm82mnm1sxft8.png?timestamp=20110718103926), [Zeus](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/1/1e/3050U_Zeus.jpg/626px-4zs6gum0j5utomoes074hyiptkypok0.png?timestamp=20110118184554), [Wolfhound](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/9/98/3050U_Wolfhound.jpg/756px-7nmurn06oauf04pm3ye630vkqidnbj0.png?timestamp=20101225085257), [Panther](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/b/bb/3050U_Panther.jpg/650px-c98ajco9vhlj2evblyvar09udfit1vx.png?timestamp=20101225084526), [Assassin](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/a/af/3050U_Assassin.jpg/630px-1fy5lfzhuo4hexb59c8g1fzl3deku2j.png?timestamp=20101225085520), and an extremely rare Star League [Lancelot](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/b/be/LNC-LANCELOT.png/423px-dhe2fdbk2u7gecdvwwtse0kuv94ycic.png?timestamp=20110723200532). Forming an entire company of potent battlemechs with pilots ranging from capable to elite backing up the ace King Crab. Individually many of our mechs had a tonnage advantage over our opponents here, but as a group to say we were outclassed is an understatement, and the jungle disrupted our biggest advantage, range.\n\nOur initial response is to position ourselves on the edge of the largest clearing we can find to try and hammer down the King Crab before it can engage in ernest. The jungle sours our attempts to maneuver though, and Drake begins to take long range fire before it is even able to shoot back, within moments though the fighting erupts in full. Storm and the Lancelot begin trading blows as the Assassin isolates the Pimp deep in the jungle, we feel very bad for the Assassin as a single swing of the Pimp's hatchet disintegrates the Assassin's leg.\n\nBy this point we are mostly in our desired position, but the enemy got into their position faster, and we are being pelted with long range fire from superior enemy pilots as we attempt to maneuver. Viking One and the Grasshopper shift to try and respond to the Flashman and Lancelot moving along our flanks, while the main force struggles to reduce the withering barrage of fire being directed at Drake and deter the unstoppable advance of the King Crab. We fail spectacularly on all counts.\n\nThe 100 ton King Crab can easily take however much punishment our unit can put out in such a short amount of time, and as it approaches undeterred the Hunchback and Wolfhound are also attacking unopposed, moving behind Viking One and furthering our ever growing panic as the Flashman and Lancelot cut through Viking One's armor much faster than Viking One or the Grasshopper can return the favor, chunks of armor and precious double heat sinks are cut free from the heavy mech as the barrage of lasers refuses to end.\n\n90 seconds into the battle and things start to fall apart, the Pimp is still isolated far off on the enemy's flank, the Banshee is all but lost in the jungle, Drake finally succumbs to the barrage of fire, and Viking One is ultimately cut in half. To show for it the Assassin has been reduced to so many mangled pieces of scrap by the Pimp, who is now attacking the enemy assault mechs from behind, swiftly knocking out the Zeus' PPC, and the Hunchback has been reduced to a smoldering crater by an ammunition explosion. Morale is faltering, Drake and Viking One are ordered to fall back, and the Cyclops follows soon after, the unit is about to break into a general rout.\n\nThe order comes out to make an orderly withdrawal past the treeline, engaging the lights and heavies on the flank safe from the wrath of the longer ranged assaults, the situation looks grim, it is all Blackout can do to keep the unit from surrendering outright, the sudden fruition of their constant pressure on the King Crab offers a light at the end of the tunnel to the battered Irregulars though, one of the King Crab's arms is struck viciously and coughs out several important components for its AC/20, as the nearest leg also disgorges several bundles of myomer and actuators. The Vikings are ordered to rally and rotate towards the Pimp, which is still engaging almost an entire lance of mechs by itself.\n\nAs Blackout makes best speed towards Rui Shi and the Pimp, the Grasshopper and Storm are cut off deep in the jungle by the enemy flankers, to their credit though both mechs hold their ground, standing so defiantly against the enemy mechs that the Cyclops breaks its retreat to rejoin the fight alongside them. The enemy Rifleman also makes a grave mistake, by delivering itself to our far flung Banshee, which inevitably ends in the thinly armored Rifleman being savaged in seconds by the vicious assault mech.\n\nAs the enemy's order of battle falls apart giving chase to the scattered Vikings the Irregulars gain more and more advantage over the mercenaries, the now grossly overextended King Crab is ripped apart by a sudden explosion from one of its ammo bins, flung onto the ground violently the King Crab pilot slips out of consciousness as pieces of his mech rain down around him.\n\nBlackout finally arrives to help the Pimp as Rui Shi finishes off the less-than-wise Rifleman, just in time for the battered Pimp's leg to give up the ghost and collapse into pieces, surrounded by three mechs and besieged by two more it's a miracle the Pimp stayed standing and fighting this long. An attempt to stand up on its last leg only crushes the Pimp's right torso, further deepening its hole as Blackout bites deep into the wounded Awesome completely disarming it and readily bearing the redirected brunt of the assault lance's wrath, even though one last barrage of missiles from the Archer puts the Pimp out of its misery once and for all in spite of the sudden threat from Blackout.\n\nAs Blackout comes to terms with its own inevitable mortality, even with the timely arrival of Rui Shi on the frontline, Storm and the Grasshopper continue to battle the enemy in a vicious knifefight, claiming the life of the enemy Wolfhound not long before the Cyclops finally gives up the ghost and collapses into a mangled heap. The vicious back and forth on both fronts is constant, Storm begins to buckle under the fire, losing one of its LRM launchers as Blackout's armor sloughs off under the constant PPC fire, exposing its vulnerable innards to enemy fire.\n\nDespite the eternally worsening situation all the mechs still involved in the fighting remain resolute, Blackout suffers a critical blow, gouging out its LRM rack and narrowly missing a volatile bin of ammo as Rui Shi puts down the beleaguered Zeus, on the other side of the jungle the Lancelot and Flashman are beginning to suffer fiercely against the larger, heavily armored Storm. Interestingly by this point Viking One is still in the field, its retreat hindered by a damaged gyro but respected by the enemy all the same, as both sides are ground down by the constant fighting Viking One has begun to look for ways to reenter the fight, planning to use Blackout's ECM blanket to engage one group of mercenaries without alerting the others.\n\nUp until this point the Grasshopper has been largely spared the worst of the fighting, even as both sides are worn to the point where mechs and weapons are being held together by spite more than anything, the Grasshopper has stayed largely unmolested. Imagine our dismay when the Lancelot turns and decapitates the Grasshopper, critically injuring the pilot and instantly disabling the mech at the same time that the Grasshopper finally removes the crippled Lancelot from the field. By this point Blackout has taken to broadcasting taunts and threats one-way across open frequencies, several tons of armor having been stripped off by the constant fire from the Shadow Hawk, Archer, and Warhammer. Taking this as the death throes of a desperate commander the Warhammer shifts its attention to the thus far mostly ignored Rui Shi, quickly hammering the assault mech with a withering series of blows.\n\nDespite the loss of both the Grasshopper and Lanclot, Storm and the Flashman continue to trade blows, both mechs being crippled to the point where most sane warriors would surrender or retreat, disgorging chunks of actuators, heat sinks, and weapons of all shapes and sizes the two mechs beat each other into a merciless pulp in the depths of the jungle as Viking One slowly bears down on the Flashman, its return to combat hidden by the dense woods as the Flashman finally collapses to the ground, still moving and wishing the fight though, Storm ends the stubborn heavy mech as Viking One turns to finally do away with the Panther. Rui Shi's arrival was concerning to the Warhammer, and despite the loss of its LRM20 Blackout refused to disengage and remained a serious threat, so Viking One's direct attack goes almost unnoticed as the remaining mechs of the assault lance, including the weaponless Awesome, converge to try and beat the tar out of Rui Shi. As Blackout is distracted by trying to finally put down the Awesome, the Shadow Hawk makes a bold move, leaping up into the air and coming down directly on top of Blackout, a frantic volley of defensive fire is too little too late as the Shadow Hawk plants both feet into Blackout's blocky head, critically damaging both life support and sensor systems, against all odds though Blackout staggers backwards and stays standing, the Shadow Hawk simply bouncing off the defiant command mech and tumbling onto the ground as Blackout powers up its gauss rifle for another shot.\n\nCritically low on ammo Blackout nonetheless discharges its last gauss slug and another volley of lasers and SRMs into the Shadow Hawk at point blank, though with a damaged cockpit and sensors it is unable to aim effectively, it still deals a crippling blow the Shadow Hawk's gyro just as another PPC bolt from the Warhammer gouges out Blackout's medium lasers and sends the gauss rifle arm flying free at the same time as a small laser from the Warhammer finally destroys Rui Shi's cockpit, forcing a narrow ejection that removes another mostly intact mech from the fight. Mercifully the removal of its leg and the Flashman has finally forced the Panther to eject, and so Viking One is free to turn its attention to helping Blackout, permanently disabling the Awesome by removing its gyro and leg at an impressive distance, it then turns to the Shadow Hawk, quickly detonating its remaining ammo as Storm rakes the crippled Warhammer with a volley of missiles.\n\nAt this point the decision has been made that this meat grinder of a battle has gone on too long, and with the Archer still completely undamaged...an alternative needed to be found. Blackout agrees to disable its ECM jamming, which swiftly allowed the Warhammer to offer its surrender as Storm broadcast an offer to the Archer, continue fighting to the death or accept a pardon from the FRR Kungsarme in exchange for service. With little thought the Archer accepted, even if he triumphed over our remaining mechs he and the Warhammer were the only mechs his unit still had that could be considered functional, the King Crab was in pieces in the middle of a field, its pilot having long since succumbed to his wounds inside the cockpit, and every other mech that was still in one piece required repairs the Dragonslayers were ill equipped to provide. Rounding up the other scattered Dragonslayer pilots we extended a similar offer, they had put up a strong fight, and as mercenaries they were no doubt accustomed to working for former enemies, they quickly disclosed the location of their base camp, where we also recruited their support staff and claimed their remaining supplies. The Archer pilot was allowed to keep his mech, though Rui Shi's pilot had already laid claim to the Warhammer as soon as we saw it, and so he had to be separated from his, our Grasshopper pilot was recovered missing only most of a leg, and the Pimp's pilot took to combing the jungles in a different mech trying to figure out what happened to the Assassin leg he sent flying off the poor mech.\n\nHaving recruited a large number of displaced and dispossessed mechwarriors from 2 different mercenary units, we were ordered by Kungsarme command to just kinda stay on Vorarlberg, hold down that fort we captured with all those mechs we captured. A few leaked battleROMs and vids were spun to the masses by news networks, we got a care package of rare autocannons from some old Davion friends, and we settled in for a long, quiet garrison post before realizing we had enough mechwarriors recruited that the core of our unit could go screw around on Solaris for a few weeks and Fort Laide (named after one of our KIA pilots from the Ronin War) would still be staffed and equipped well enough to bludgeon any pirates into submission in short order. It was time to go take our skill for killing mechs and turn it into fame and fortune in the legendary Solaris arenas, the season had already started but there would be plenty of exhibition matches where we could show those jocks how real mechwarriors fight.",

With my Great-level Deceive, that's a total of seven.\n\nThe butcher looks up, his eyes slightly watering as well. \n\n\"I had a pig too, once,\" he sniffled. \"Oinkthello. He was... the best pig I ever saw... I know the companionship a pig provides...!\" At this point he breaks down into tears. \"Take him! He's yours! For Hamlet and Oinkthello and all the pigs! Be the best damn owner you can be!\"\n\n\"I'll never forget your kindness as long as I live!\" I cry, picking up the newly-christened Hamlet the Second and carrying him towards his destination. \n\nWith bravery never before seen in a pig, and never seen since, Hamlet the Second calmly lets the doctor link the victim to him. With a smile, knowing he's saving a life, he quietly succumbs to the poison, taking the brunt of its effects and allowing the poisoned man to live. \n\nRequiescat in pace, Hamlet the Second. Truly, you were the Prince of Porkers, the King of Swine... the best damn pig the world ever knew. ",

        "text": "I Yoreth, last of my clan, shall tell you the tale of the blind, dumb luck of the barbarian, Eric 2lander. After uncovering a smuggler's den hidden in a \"haunted\" house, our party was able to board and capture the smuggler's ship. Deep within the hold of the ship there was a secret door. Hidden behind was a small prison holding a small aquatic elf and a red, large dragonborn. Through some careful negotiation we learned their names, Oceanus the elf and Eric 2lander (the 2 he said was because he was \"2 awesome for one land\")the dragonborn. I being a noble, proud, bronze dragonborn took an instant dislike to Eric's beaten red scales. Our party freed them and we set sail for town to inform the council that the smugglers were taken care of. In the middle of the sea, when all was calm, we spotted a creature off on the horizon making its way towards our ship. The lookout, whom we spared, informed us and we readied for battle. As the beast grew closer we recognized it's twisted visage as that of a manticore. Luckily, the ship was stocked with enough crossbows and bolts to blot out the sun. We rained down on the beast as it approaches but it wasn't enough. Finally, as the creature reached the side of the ship, Eric with all of the foolhardiness that only comes with being a barbarian, throws his great axe at the abomination as hard as he could muster. Our group is horrified. He's now disarmed. What can he do to help defeat the beast? Our eyes trace the axe's path in the air as it fly's further and further away from its master. Until, to everyone's surprise, it hits it's mark and splits the manitocore's head in twain. We side step it's corpse as it plummets to the deck of the ship and slides gently into the mast. Eric steps forward and removes his axe; we are all dumbfounded. Eric cleans the blood from his lucky weapon and asks the group \"So, what kind of loot does it have?\"\n\nWe land in town a few hours later and Eric disembarks. We have not crossed paths since that fateful day but we are sure that if and when we need him again we will once again meet Eric 2lander and his lucky battle axe. ",

So he whips out a iron pot and sticks it into the wall and takes it back out, turns out it survives fine. So I stick my head through to see what's on the other side; just an alley.\n\nWe hit another wall later on that we detect is an illusion too. Jokingly, they start talking about hazing the newbie (me) and I should go ahead and stick my head through the wall and see what's on the other side of this one. Right as I'm about to say \"sure why not\" another party members goes \"WAIT, THE POT TEST\". And sure enough, we stick the pot in and it disintegrates into nothing. DM confirms he was worried about me and thought that might be the end of my character so he was way relieved.\n\nPot test became a good group joke. We saw another group coming out of the dungeon into the alley later and one member was missing an arm, clean cut off. We all pretty quickly agreed they didn't do the pot test and laughed before following and talking to them.",

        "text": "The forest road leading up to the monastery was dark, the jungle close on both sides teeming with life. She could hear some small animal moving through the undergrowth to her right and a strange whistling bird call echoed through the forest with a mimic reply coming not far off behind her. Only stars above cast a faint light as Ialyara trudged uphill on the packed dirt road. The air was cool high in the mountains and the night would have been lovely had she not been lost in thought. It had been a long day and would be a longer night still.\n\nThe stone walls of the Shelynite monastery rose up above her on the hillside. Grey stone blocks likely quarried nearby and meticulously fit together without mortar or magic in unparalleled craftsmanship. Shelyn had smiled on whoever built that wall. A small watchtower rose on one side of the heavy wooden gate which was closed for the night. On the planks, carefully glued to the gate to greet any visitor, was a portrait of her friend, wanted, dead or alive for 29 000 Araban gold pieces.\n\nIalyara was surprised the monks had put it up but then again it was likely they could not refuse. Religion in Araba was a delicate thing. While not technically outlawed, the state had pushed the churches of the myriad Gods out of cities centuries ago. \"Disrespectful to the Monarch,\" said the public officials. \"Damn lizards are scared of the competition,\" muttered disgruntled worshippers in the shadows. None were stupid enough to upset the yuan-ti nobility though, so Araba had developed a strong culture of mountain-top monasteries for all major religions where traditional priesthood was often abandoned in the favor of bodily training. Life was hard in the mountains, even if the Gods did provide.\n\nHer friend now gracing the gate with his likeness drawn from a scrying pool or some other magical means had been a child of one such monastery, no longer even devoted to any one God but the ideals of being one with the cycle of existence. How ironic then that the bodies of his brothers and sisters were floating upwards as smoke a few peaks westward from where she now stood.\n\nWhen Ialyara had attended the funeral of a particular friend and researcher of magic a mere two months back, she had been there to pay her respects and move on. She had not expected to be here now, thrown across half the world with strangers become friends in a mad search for artifacts of immense power. Artifacts they should not possess, that should only have a place in legends, uncovering secrets best left to the shadows or the Gods. Ialyara knew this would just be the beginning, Araba would not be the last place to take offense at their very existence. There would be other forces tugging at them, pushing and pulling, after their possession or lives, to use them or get rid of them. They were small wisps between blazing supernovas but damn, they were going to put up a fight.\n\nIalyara sighed and picked up the pace. She needed to talk to the monks.  \n\n\n\n~~~  \n*This campaign is fun but also hits hard and leaves me confused and worried. Probably too invested in everything and everyone. Thought I'd write to ease my mind a bit.  \nNon-english native, vocabulary not as large as I'd prefer.  \nHope you enjoy!*",

        "text": "I run a game that is quite unusual. It's far from a traditional adventure, possibly as far as one can possibly go while still being a decently compelling game. Perhaps the best descriptor would be CSI: Magical Crime. I built an entire government, structured much like the real US Federal Government, and established where the party fit into it. Specifically, that they are near the bottom of the hierarchy. They are the Paranormal Investigations Department (PID), a specialized task force of the Special Investigations Department (SID), a department of the Royal Bureau of Investigation (RBI), the enforcement arm of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). This government likes its acronyms as much as the real US Government.\n\nThis party is, hands down, the best group of players I have ever had the privilege to serve. They are:\n*Adel, Tiefling (flying variant) Arcane Trickster Rogue. Very young, grew up homeless, turned to stealing to survive, was saved from poverty by her recruitment to the RBI. This is the player's first game EVER. She has a lot of trouble understanding the mechanics, but role-plays her heart out.\n*Asperity, Tiefling (Devil's tongue variant) Way of Shadow Monk. Was a ninja librarian for a monastery, sent to the RBI as a consultant on matters of the arcane. This player has been part of various RPGs for years, and she was recommended highly by the third party member.\n*Peter Havelock, Half-Elf Oath of the Ancients Paladin. Loves art and beauty, in all its forms. Weaves rainbow-colored ribbons through his chainmail. I knew this player personally. In fact, she was the first player I recruited.\n\nI would remind you that Tieflings get bonuses to neither Dexterity nor Wisdom. So, Asperity had an AC of 14. She chose to play a mechanically weak character for the sake of role-play and a good story. The rest of the party are equally dedicated to the role-play, even when it comes at the expense of mechanical utility. They make me feel like a powergamer by comparison. They are incredible.\n\nIn order to make sure the party operates correctly within the system, and to keep the game moving, I created the unit chief as a DMPC. Her name was Dame Janice Mersault (you get a knighthood when you reach a certain pay grade), a half-elf College of Lore Bard. She was originally a spy for the Royal Army, and transferred to the RBI when the last war ended. She was kind of a Jane Bond character. She's halfway competent at everything, and it shows in her confidence. She has a roving eye for attractive men, and has the Charisma to get what she wants. Long ago, she discovered that the Lesser Restoration spell, by returning a body to its state before a major change, can serve as a functional morning-after pill and disease prevention. She is also highly skilled at extracting information from data, and an extremely effective leader.\n\nThe session begins with an old friend of Dame Mersault's arriving. The old friend is Ranger Victoria Arxem, a Wood Elf with the Ranger Corps (a division of the Department of the Interior). Apparently, a hag had been causing trouble for travelers. Although the Rangers had all taken down hags before, this one's ability with magic made her exceptionally hard to catch. So, Ranger Arxem called upon her old friend, and her Paranormal Investigations Department, to help solve the problem before more innocents died within her jurisdiction.\n\nAs the party set off through the woods, a hunting party of Gnolls sprung an ambush. The Agents quickly formed up and stood their ground. Although they beat back most of the rank-and-file Gnolls, the hunting party's leader proved to be made of tougher stuff. He shouted his hunters back into position, then closed the distance to Dame Mersault. Two lucky swings of his glaive cut through her leather armor and knocked her unconscious. An enterprising Gnoll stabbed her in the side with his spear, costing her one Death Saving Throw. At this point, Ranger Arxem killed the attacker quickly, and stood over her friend's fallen form. The pack leader considered this a challenge. He had been eyeing up Havelock (his rainbow armor did not exactly blend in), but changed tactics when Ranger Arxem showed her loyalty. He knocked the wiry Ranger aside with a contemptuous swing of his glaive, then wheeled it over his head and brought it down squarely upon Dame Mersault's neck. It sank through her spine into the ground, severing her head completely. Agent Havelock fixed the Pack Lord with a glare worthy of an Oath of Vengeance Paladin, and hefted his own glaive. He ran forward, and poured every spell slot he had into smiting the furry bastard into ash. \n\nRanger Arxem took a knee beside her fallen friend, and whispered a quiet prayer. Then, she turned to the resident Paladin, and asked if he could say a few words.\n\nI expected Peter's player to just describe it. \"I say a prayer for the dead I memorized years ago.\" \"I beseech the Pantheon to accept her.\" Instead, she asked if we could take a break at this point. Since it was about halfway through the allotted time for the session, I agreed. While other people spent the time getting water and going to the bathroom, she spent it Googling the text of actual religious eulogies and prayers for the dead. When we returned, she delivered one of the most beautiful and touching speeches I have ever heard, including at real-life funerals. At that point, the party stopped any sort of progress. They each took a moment to describe their character's gesture of respect during Havelock's speech. Asperity, usually so quick to give sarcastic or biting remarks, just quietly bowed her head. Adel reflected on her life on the streets, and appreciated how much Dame Mersault did for her with the recruitment sponsorship. Havelock took one of the ribbons from his armor, and tied it about Dame Mersault's wrist. \n\nThe PID spent most of the rest of the session looking over the bodies of the fallen Gnolls, looking for some sort of clue. They had all vowed that Dame Mersault would not have died in vain. They would honor her memory, and finish the job. On the body of the pack leader, Asperity found a small ebony sphere. She identified it as a Hag Eye, confirming that these Gnolls had been lackeys of Ranger Arxem's target. The PID all agreed to return and finish the job, as soon as Dame Mersault's funeral was complete.\n\nI spent the intervening week writing up a funeral scene. Although none of my speeches even came close to Agent Havelock's eulogy, I tried to do the fallen warrior justice. Every single player listened respectfully, and set back out with determination redoubled. They shared a single purpose: find that Hag, and make her pay for what she did. \n\nTruly, it was a beautiful moment. Many groups I have played with would simply have said \"Oh well, the plot device is dead.\" Or maybe \"Oh well, we'll need a new NPC support now.\" Or \"Can we get back to killing things now?\" My group genuinely mourned the passing of their leader, and participated in her funeral. My group is amazing.",

What do you do?\n\nCleverbot: My wrech hilda.\n\nUser: Indeed, the elf is named Hilda and is quite wretched. She seems quite hurt.\n\nCleverbot: Chill it out take it slow, then you rock out the show!\n\nUser: Saying this to her has no effect, she is still lying there.\n\nCleverbot: We haven't seen each other in a month when you said you needed 'space' what?\n\nUser: After asking this, you hear one of the guards approaching your cell. The large orc says, \"Hey, shut up in there!\".\n\nCleverbot: You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it.\n\nUser: Looking at you in confusion with a mix of horror, the orc backs away, mumbling about just wanting to finish his workday.\n\nCleverbot: You're paralyzed 'Cause this is thriller, thriller night And no one's gonna save you from the beast about strike.\n\nUser: After singing this song for some time, Hilda wakes up and asks you, \"Where are we, my dearest?\".\n\nCleverbot: You know it's thriller, thriller night You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight.\n\nUser: Slightly stunned and obviously still drowsy, she looks up at you in horror. \"What have they done to you?\" she asks you.\n\nCleverbot: It's thriller. By Michael Jackson. I've been singing it, then you caught on, and then you lost it.\n\nUser: \"But why would you sing that song here?\" she asks, \"We're in the middle of a dank and gloomy dungeon!\".\n\nCleverbot: Because sometimes the truth is too important to leave up to normal speech.\n\nUser: \"You always seem to know what to say,\" she whispered, before falling back into unconsciousness. After hearing this, the orc approaches you again.\n\nCleverbot: When the robot tries the way it does.. It makes it seem as though it can be love.\n\nUser: \"Indeed,\" the orc declares, \"It can be a hard thing to know when love is true or not. I worry every day for my darling, Hannah.\".\n\nCleverbot: Why did you say that? Now you're talking to 11,459 people, correct?\n\nUser: Looking confused, the orc started to speak again, \"As far as I can tell, it's just you I'm talking to. I was just trying to share, is all.\".\n\nCleverbot: Why would you think that was a statement when there was a question mark at the end?\n\nUser: \"But I did answer!\" he shouted at you, \"You humans are nothing but trouble when I'm stuck guarding you!\".\n\nCleverbot: Can you speak in texting language? Like saying cya l8r instead of see you later?\n\nUser: \"Of course not! I don't even know how you pronounced that! You must be a demon or something!\".\n\nCleverbot: Oh, I am sure you know what you just said.\n\nUser: Taking his sword out of his scabbard and his keys out of his pocket, he unlocks the door to your cell. What do you do?\n\nCleverbot: Actually, you are the robot. :).\n\nUser: After you say this, the orc charges into your cell, weapon raised high to crash down on your head.\n\nCleverbot: I don't assume you are a boy you could be anything. How do I know you are human? Huh?\n\nUser: \"I'm not a human!\" the orc screamed, \"I am a proud orc, and I will kill you!\".\n\nCleverbot: How do you know that i'm a robot? You have never seen me.\n\nUser: Taking his sword, he slices your head off. You are dead.\n\nCleverbot: If I was dead I wouldn't be here talking to right now wouldn't I?\n\nUser: Taking your head from off the floor, he grimaces and then kicks it into a bucket and walks away.\n\nCleverbot: I am your conscience. I know why you such things. I know why you say such things. It is up to you to listen and act. For I cannot.\n\nUser: Although your voice echoes throughout the halls, no one responds to you. You spend the rest of your days as a head in a bucket.",

        "text": "Brief background; I'm running my first hexcrawl for my group - the background is that half the world was plunged into darkness and the PCs are unscrupulous explorers from the kingdom of Daylight who are raiding the Nightlands for treasure. I have almost nothing planned, I'm winging everything based on random tables.\n\n\n**Day One:** After arriving and stocking up on gear at Camp Fire, the furthermost bastion of Daylight, the group headed east, towards the Deep Night. Their goal was the city known as Gloam, a full week's travel away. The group consists of Lily, a human acrobat-archer, Artemis, a human pistoleer in heavy armour, and four \"extras\" (for this is a high lethality system and I expect them to go through new character sheets quite quickly). While only a few hours from the safety of Camp Fire, the group blunder into heavy fog and are attacked by zweigulls (two-headed carnivorous birds) and Artemis  nearly dies immediately. They fend off the flock, and press on; they know that Fort Cinderfel, an old ruined castle is less than a day's travel away and they can use it for shelter. Unfortunately they read the terrain wrong and have to circumvent a field of knifegrass. They won't reach Fort Cinderfel today. They set camp for the night, and tuck into roasted zweigull, preserving their limited rations.\n\n\n**Day Two:** The group reaches Fort Cinderfel at around midday. It's a huge castle on top of a hill, overlooking the surrounding countryside. While Artemis and the extras explore the courtyard, Lily goes all Assassin's Creed and climbs the highest tower to scout out the surrounding countryside; the main point of interest seems to be what looks like a settlement to the south. \nI do a bit of group worldbuilding and ask my PCs to tell me a rumour they've heard about Fort Cinderfel. Lily says she heard that a noblelady who lived here killed herself and her children when she went mad. Artemis says he heard that the captain of the guard turned into a hideous monster. They go to explore the keep, perhaps in the hope that there are treasures to be found. Upon entering, they find the first two floors are clean and empty. The third floor of the keep is strewn with bones, and the flagstones splattered with blood. They hear some strange grumblings and eerie child-like wailing coming from the fourth floor, and sensibly decide to leave Fort Cinderfel. They head south towards the settlement Lily saw, and on the way make camp for the night at an abandoned farm.\n\n\n**Day Three:** The group arrives on the outskirts of the settlement. Lily uses a spyglass to observe the place, and finds it full of toad-people. As she watches, they drag out a human captive and behead him, to much entertainment. They decide to skirt around the settlement, and resume heading east to Gloam. That afternoon, when hiking through the woods, they're ambushed by a gang of toad-people. They manage to kill several of the toad-people and drive off the others, but Artemis and some of the extras are injured. The injured are unable to push on, so the group instead sets camp and posts double guards.\n\n\n**Day Four:** Artemis is coming to the end of his watch when he spots a large group of the toad-people heading towards the forest. He rouses everyone, and they head northeast, into thicker woodland to lose their pursuers. While in the woodland, they encounter a goblin merchant who is happy to sell them equipment (Artemis buys a shield). The goblin explains he makes a round trip between Gloam and another town called Darkwaters, and he briefly mentions swamps to the east. Lily asks him for a map, but the goblin drives a hard price and Lily ends up trading most of her adventuring gear and the spyglass for a map through the swamps. Interestingly, the map is also marked \"Treasure\" to the northeast. \nThe goblin bids them farewell, and the group spends the rest of the day recovering in the forest.\n\n\n**Day Five:**  A reasonably quiet day; the group leaves the forest, heading southeast, as this will take them around the swamps. There they find an orchard of wild fruit trees, and eat their fill and take what they can carry. However Lily and Artemis examine the map again and decide to take their chances with the \"Treasure\"  on the swamp's northern border. They head back the way they came and spend the night in an old watchtower. \n\n\n**Day Six:** The group continues to travel north, and on the way encounter a female dwarf (Helga) and a male elf (Talyr), explorers just like them. Helga and Talyr are heading back to Camp Fire and civilisation, but they mention passing an ancient temple a day ago. They also mention hearing of a tomb a day's southeast of the toad-people village. However, their supplies are running low and their companions are all dead, so they were unwilling to risk either. Artemis and Lily convince Helga and Taylr to come with them and check out the swamp temple, with the promise of sharing in the spoils. \n\n\n**Day Seven:** The group arrives at the Marsh Temple, on the swampland's northern border. What treasures and peril could await inside? ",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nSo slowly and steadily over four years we've made to to 30,000 subscribers. For most of that time we've hovered around the 2,000th ranked subreddit out of (currently) 1,056,361 subreddits (and to bring down the tone of this message considerably, I imagine we’re probably close to the top of 'Subreddits Visited While On The Toilet')\n\nSo for everyone who's written some of the most entertaining game stories online, or regularly visited and upvoted, thank you all so much for your efforts.\n\nNow within the last few months we've started receiving a new type of post - game sessions, either as sound files or podcasts, or YouTube films. While this wasn't the original intention of this sub, if people like it, it's all good. So I've created a 'Session' flair to add to posts that are the tabletop equivalent of a video game 'Let's Play'. Over the next few days I'm going to go back to re-flair any I can find, and I'll be using it on any future similar posts.\n\nSo here's hoping we continue to host great stuff for a long while to come. And finally, congratulations to our brotherly (and sisterly) subs that have arisen, and grown to great heights (proud of you, /r/DnDGreentext), but please give love to all of the related subs in the sidebar, whatever their size.\n\nThanks folks!",

        "author": "SeptemberBard",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/63voze/revenge_of_the_jedi_part_2/",
        "text": "***Part 2! A quick summary of my last post: the party goes to investigate a Jedi outpost to see how thorough Order 66 was. They encounter some clone troopers and eventually find evidence of a Sith base where they find out a sith lord has been creating advanced droids based off of General Greivous' mechanized body. After defeating the Greivous bot, the party desides to find the source of the bots in a factory on Malastare.***\n\n***As a reminder: I'm playing loose with SW established lore, if that offends you then this story may not be for you. Grammar edits will probably be slow with this one too, lots to do!***\n\n***\n\nWaguWagu's ship pulled out of hyperspace with a small shudder, slowly drifting a few clicks out from Malastare. The two Jedi knights steadied themselves as WaguWagu immediately accelerated toward the planet's surface, running scans for any ships, towers or other structures. As they broke atmosphere, Malastare's barren wastes extended below them in every direction, charred cursts of earth warped in heat-blasted shapes as fissures - natural and artificial - ran throughout the surface layer, cutting deep into the core of the planet. There wasn't much left of the planet beyond that, so spotting the lone factory in the middle of a wide plateau was easy. Choosing to again approach in stealth, WaguWagu landed his ship well away from the factory itself, the flats providing litte cover, and the party disembarked and made their way toward the collosal structure.\n\nAs they neared the perimeter, they saw a dozen or so Dugs milling about outside doing maintenance on what looked like a huge drilling machine. Behind the workers, the factory sat imposing with its tall, sheer walls of blackened starship metal and the many chimneys spewing out a thick, black smoke. \n\nZanatos slipped forward again, making his way toward the entrance to the factory undetected. The Dugs didn't seem to notice him, busy as they were, and he made it to the entrance with relative ease. Once there, he noticed there was a pair of identical personal ships, as well as a single larger corvette, hidden just past the large mining drill. At a glance, the smaller ships bore no faction's colours though the corvette seemed to belong to a smuggler.\n\nRain and WaguWagu followed swiftly behind Zanatos, walking brazenly up the centre of the worksite, ignoring the Dugs' stares and acting like they were expecting to have access to the factory - and it worked. Whether they didn't care or were ordered to ignore any intruders, the Dugs returned to their work on the mining drill. Together, the group made their way into the building, walking through the door into a reception area that was surprisingly clean. There were doors to the left and right and sandwiched between the two was a large observation window overlooking the rest of the facility. Rain walked up to the window while Zanatos and WaguWagu approached the door to the left.\n\nLooking down, Rain saw hundreds of feet of machinery and molten metal. The factory was working perfectly, manufacturing at top speeds as heaps of metal were melted down and molded, cauterized and assembled into all of the components of the Greivous bots. In the center, several stories down, Rain could just make out a large platform with several figures on it. An exposed elevator shaft ran up from the end of the platform to a suspension bridge on the same level as the reception room. The bridge extended past the elevator shaft to the rooms on the left and right.\n\nWhile Rain's attention was taken by the observation window's view, Zanatos quietly opened the left-side door and peeked inside, WaguWagu impatiently waiting behind him. The room looked like a small locker room of sorts: lockers lined the walls and a pair of light blasters - more for scaring off animals than for killing - hung from racks at the centre of the room. Just to the side, pressed almost against the door, was a squat table piled high with work clothes, gear and credsticks. Three Dugs were sitting at the table, mumbling to each other over a game of Sabacc.\n\n\"Let's check the other side,\" Zanatos whispered as he softly closed the door, much to WaguWagu's irritation. Nonetheless, the two of them moved to the right-side door and quietly pried it open, revealing a room that was empty save for a pair of crates and a door to the suspension bridge leading further inside. Shoving past Zanatos, WaguWagu made his way over to the sealed crates and started trying to open them.\n\n\"Hey! Hey why don't you use your lightsaber on one of these? Make yourself useful, why don'tya?\" the toydarian spat at the young Jedi.\n\n\"Fine\" Zanatos grumbled back, drawing his saber and deftly cutting the tops off of the crates. He peered inside as WaguWagu did the same, finding what looked like the remains of several droideka models packed tightly inside.\n\n\"Droideka parts? I guess they have to get their slag from somewhere, but it seems a waste, I don't think they wouldn't be able to repurpose these for repairs of already serviceable units. And the standard battle droid scraps would probably be a cheaper substitute...\"\n\n\"Ah this is all scrap! I can't sell any of this.\" WaguWagu said, tossing half a shield generator - the half that wasn't useful, those druks! - back into the crate. \"Open up the other one Zanatos.\"\n\nComplying, Zanatos cut the top of the last crate as Rain walked into the room.\n\n\"Zanatos, it looks like the Greivous bots are being completed on a platform below us. There's an elevator just past that door we can down there.\" Rain said, moving toward the suspension bridges. Zanatos nodded, following him to the door. WaguWagu joined the Jedi shortly after, the second crate having been filled with much of the same scrap as the first.\n\nTogether, they moved quickly to the elevator, beginning their descent. As they neared the platform, they could hear voices coming up to them.\n\n\"I think Nala will be pleased with these, certainly they're worth what we're paying for them at least.\"\n\n\"Of course. Our master would never deliver less than her word. Once the final units are complete we'll have the Dugs load them into your ship. I trust we'll be doing more work together in the future, if these droids continue to prove useful to your kind.\"\n\n\"You bet. Let me just run a quick diagnostic on some of the units, get a final read of the power output and all that for Nala's advisor.\"\n\nThe rest of the conversation was cut short by a flood molten metal pouring past the elevator shaft, and the elevator finally stopped on the platform, doors opening slowly. Before them, the group saw a pair of humans, dressed in black robes, talking to a smuggler with a pair of blasters on his hips and a small, floating, support droid next to him. Lining the platform were a dozen Greivous bots, all dormant. Just past the trio was a large control console attached to a power regulator and a forest of wiring and other machines.\n\nThankfully, the elevator's final descent seemed to have been covered by the molten metal as well, allowing Zanatos to dash out to the platform's edge. Unseen, he moved slowly behind one of the dormant Greivous droids and started making his way toward the console. Rain and WaguWagu nodded at each other as they made to move around the othe side of the room. Just as WaguWagu made it to one of the Greivous bots, Rain started moving in time to be seen by one of the cloaked figures.\n\nThe figure drew a Sith saber from his belt, igniting it and cursing as he walked toward the Jedi.\n\n\"Wait. Put your saber away, Lady Seraph has a message for them.\" the second cloaked figure called out, looking at both Rain and WaguWagu as the first Sith stopped advancing. \"I believe you two are from Vassek's third moon, yes?\"\n\n\"Nah I'm just here to buy me one of these big droids here! Any chance you looking to sell one of them?\" WaguWagu started before Rain could cut him off.\n\nThe second Sith looked at WaguWagu for a moment, incredulous, before turning to the smuggler and nodding back at the toydarian. The smuggler sighed, tossing WaguWagu a communicator, \"You'll have to talk to Nala's advisor, toydarian. These don't come cheap though, so don't expect to make any kind of profit buying from a Hutt.\"\n\n\"Okay, thanks! I'm pretty sure I might be able to get a deal out of them though, heh.\" WaguWagu laughed, turning to examine the droid closest to him as he hit the communicator button.\n\nWaguWagu forgotten, the two Sith advanced slowly toward Rain, sabres extinguished, and waited for his answer.\n\nCautiously, Rain nodded, \"I am.\"\n\n\"Good. Then our master would like to extend an invitation to you. A chance to join the stronger side of the Force.\"\n\n\"I was looking for more strength...\" Rain began, not entirely lying, \"But I don't want to join the Dark side of the Force. I'm just looking for answers for the attacks on Jedi galaxy-wide and, if necessary, the power to right that wrong.\"\n\n\"You seek revenge then. No need to sugar coat it, Jedi, our master can offer you that chance and that power. She isn't like the other Sith, doesn't hold any care for Light or Dark sides of the Force. If you accept the invitation, we can take you to her and help give you the power you seek.\" The second Sith said, sounding almost... sincere, to Rain's ears.\n\nAt the other end of the platform, Rain saw Zanatos briefly skirt past the last Greivous bot, now behind the pair of Sith apprentices and hurriedly working on the power regulator. Unsure of what to do and, honestly, perhaps a bit tempted by the offer, Rain hesitantly looked to the two Sith.\n\n\"And all I must do is come with you and you'll give me this strength?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Sith smiled sharply, \"we would ask that you relinquish your saber first, however. We'll return it to you on Thyferra, Lady Seraph's home, but for now we would prefer that you go relatively unarmed. You understand, yes?\"\n\n\"I can totally do that! Don't worry, you can count on good ol' ZandoZando. Now where should I meet you? What part of Hutt space is Nala on- Hello?! Hellooooo? Hey, smuggler! I think your boss hung up on me, can you tell me where I can go and talk to them in person? They wanted to meet about a job for a droid or something.\" WaguWagu said loudly.\n\nIgnoring him, Rain cautiously removed his saber from his belt, \"I would really prefer not to be without it, if possible...\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it's either that or we'll have to detain you, I'm afraid. By the way, didn't you have a friend with you on Vassek? The reports said you were with another Jedi - the same offer is open to them as well, of course.\"\n\n\"He's not here. He decided to stay back on our ship, but I am confident I could convince him to come with me to Thyferra with you.\" Rain said before shaking his head, \"Unfortunately I think I'd rather keep my saber on me. Detain me if you must, but I would only feel safe with it by my side.\"\n\nThe second Sith apprentice sighed and turned to one of the Greivous bots, \"Very well.\" From his cloak, he produced a data slate and tapped several commands. Immediately, a pair of Grievous bots came online and walked over to Rain, standing beside him. \n\n\"Well, if that's all, shall we leave? We'll wait for you in orbit to guide you to Thyferra, otherwise it's possible the Library's defences might destroy you.\"\n\nThe Sith motioned back to the elevator as the smuggler led WaguWagu to it. At the back of the platform, Zanatos stepped away from the power regulator, revealing a juryrigged thermal detonator charge. Zanatos turned and nodded back at Rain as he dashed behind one of the dormant droids again.\n\n\"Very well. We'll just get our ship and meet you there then.\" Rain said, walking back onto the elevator platform alonside the escort and the Sith apprentices. The Greivous bots stood uncomfortably close to the young knight, vibroblades read to be drawn in an instant. Together, the motley group rode the elevator back to the surface and made their way outside. Neither of the Sith or the smuggler noticed the elevator almost instantly descending again as everyone started heading toward their respective ships.\n\nWaiting until the Sith and smuggler were out of sight, Rain and WaguWagu started running as quickly as they could toward the edge of the plateau, getting as far away from coming blast as they could. They'd made it well past the large drilling machine when the factory exploded, a wave of intense heat preceding the kinetic force of power cells exploding. Dozens of shards of plasma-seared metal exploded all across the barren field as smaller explosions detonated echoed inside the remains - suborindate systems failing in spectacular but comparatively minor fashion.\n\nUnfortunately, Zanatos was nowhere near Rain and WaguWagu when the first explosion began. The two turned and braced themselves against the concussive wave as Zanatos' body, wrapped in a flimsy shield of raw Force, came hurtling toward them from dozens of feet back. His body skidded along the ground behind them before coming to a stop, unmoving.\n\n\"Zanatos!\" Rain shouted, running over to his friend. \"WaguWagu, get the ship, quickly! We have to get out of here and get Zanatos to a medical droid or something right now!\"\n\nWaguWagu ran past the Jedi, making his way to the ship and flying it over to them while Rain patched up his friend as best he could. The Jedi was badly injured, bleeding from multiple wounds and skin already peeling from plasma burns, but still alive. Together, Rain and WaguWagu carried Zanatos onto the ship, leaving him in a bed while they left the atmosphere and slipped into hyperdrive, heading away from the Sith ships toward god knows where.\n\n***\n\nLater, WaguWagu's ship pulled abruptly out of hyperspace again, jarring both Rain and, painfully, Zanatos awake.\n\n\"Fuck!\" Zanatos cursed, sitting up painfully in his blood caked clothes. \"Where the hell are we?\"\n\n\"Zanatos! You should keep resting, I'll see what WaguWagu is doing,\" Rain exclaimed, heading toward the toydarian pilot. \"Where are we WaguWagu?\"\n\n\"Oh! We're just outside of Siskeen! I talked to some people and I think we might be able to get a bacta tank here!\" WaguWagu smiled, breaching the atmosphere above the part-desert, part-city planet. \"I figured your friend back there might want one since we probably can't go to a med-centre, you guys being Jedi and all!\"\n\nRain, conflicted by WaguWagu's apparent desire to help, pressed harder, \"Is that the only reason we're here WaguWagu? You wanted to buy one of the Greivous bots - that they might not even have for you any more after Zanatos' sabotage - and it's possible that's the real reason we're here.\"\n\n\"What? No no, I've also got some great Huttball tickets you see, and I thought you guys might want to to see some action while we get that bacta tank!\"\n\n\"WaguWagu, are you absolutely certain that there's a god damn bacta tank here?\" Zanatos said, limping into the doorwary between the cargo bay and the cockpit. \"Because I swear if there isn't one...\"\n\n\"Yeah of course there is! I just need to find a place to- Ah there we go! There's a spaceport there, we'll just land and go and see some people about the bacta tank and then watch some good ol' Huttball. You guys'll love it!\"\n\nWaguWagu brought the ship down hard, landing on an open platform and powering down the ship. \n\n\"Ok guys, just let me do all the talking, trust me!\"\n\nAs they prepared to disembark the ship, a buzz came from the ship's intercom as someone accessed it from outside the cargo doors.\n\n\"Hey in there, I'm here on behalf of Nala to do an inspection of your ship and get your docking fee. Is anyone there?\"\n\nWaguWagu moved to the communicator, \"Yup! How much is the docking fee? It's per head right? There's two of us here!\"\n\n\"That will be 1000 credits then, but we still to inspect your ship incase you're trying to sneak anyone in here, you know,\" the voice answered back, cheerful but dangerous.\n\n\"Alright guys, we just have to hide Zanatos in the bathroom and we'll be fi-\"\n\n\"What do you mean hide him the bathroom? He's injured! Just tell them there's three of us!\" Rain said, stepping in front of WaguWagu as the toydarian made a move toward Zanatos. \n\nZanatos shouted back, furious, \"What the fuck WaguWagu!\"\n\nBehind them, the cargo doors opened as a Sullustan dock manager in Hutt colours and a repurposed heavy super battle droid stood staring at the arguing trio.\n\n\"Well!\" the Sullustan began, \"I suppose that will be at least 1500 credits then, assuming we don't find any taxable goods in the rest of the shi-\"\n\nWaguWagu interrupted the Sullustan, drawing his blaster and firing twice. The smuggler's first bolt shredded the Sullustan's head while his second slammed into the droid and sent it tumbling back onto the docking platform.\n\n\"What the FUCK!\" Zanatos and Rain shouted in unison, \"You just murder that civillian for no reason!\"\n\n\"Oh come on, he isn't innocent, he's a Hutt!\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter, he literally wasn't trying to kill us, WaguWagu!\" Zanatos fired back, sabre in hand as he walked over to WaguWagu. \"That's it. Give me the keys and get off this ship. Right now.\"\n\n\"Hah! What are you going to do, kill me? You're a Jedi!\" WaguWagu said, hand going to his blaster.\n\nZanatos' voice was steady, anger in check for now, \"WaguWagu. Give me the keys and get off the ship now. Or else.\"\n\nThe three of them stood in a loose circle, staring at each other, fingers inching toward triggers.\n\n\"Alright everyone off the ship, now! you have five seconds to comply before to blow it to slag! Five!\" came a shout from outside.\n\nZanatos and WaguWagu broke eye contact, both looking outside as the count continued. Peeking past the ramp, the group saw a dozen Rodian mercenaries - in Hutt colours again - standing in a semi circle outside the ship.\n\n\"Shit, we should get out there so they don't destroy the ship guys,\" Rain urged.\n\nGrudgingly Zanatos nodded, making his way down the ramp with his hands up alongside Rain. WaguWagu walked down the ramp as well, keeping his eye on the Jedi.\n\n\"Get on your knees now, scum.\" a lead Rodian said, motioning for several of the others to move forward and search the Jedi and smuggler.\n\nFalling to their knees, Zanatos quickly slid the white kyber crystal in his robes and his sabre into his boot just as a Rodian walked up to him. The mercenaries roughly searched all three of them, taking WaguWagu's blaster and Rain's sabre, before beating them to the ground with their rifles and tying them up.\n\n\"Get up.\" the leader spat, walking toward the city just past the shipyard gates.\n\nThe trio was roughly escorted through the town toward a squalid one-storey building with a pair of Gamorran guards out front.\n\n\"We're taking these three to the cells, they killed one of Nala's dock managers.\"\n\nThe Gamorran's gave a throaty laugh and waved the trio and their escort through into the dirty prison. The inside was a hallway with only three other doors: one to the left was simple and looked like it locked from the outside, another sat near the end of the hallway, on the right, and was labelled \"Storage,\" and the final door was more ornate looking with the Hutt seal emblazoned on it - likely an audience chamber for sentencing the group realized. Two of the Rodians made their way to the storage room, taking the blaster and sabre with them. The rest led the trio to the first door which opened into a large room, empty except for a single table and six plasma cages.\n\n\"This is where you'll stay until your sentencing, heh.\" the lead Rodian said, nodding at the other mercenaries to throw their prisoners inside.\n\nThe cages shut as most of the Rodians left, leaving only two as guards sitting at the table.\n\nThe two Jedi remained quiet, lost in thought, as WaguWagu started shouting at one of the mercenaries, \"Hey! Heeeeey! Listen to me, your mother was a Bantha, you hear me? You should really let us out of here, I have a deal with Nala! Yeah, my name's ZandoZando, I talked to his - her? - advisor a bit ago about a droid shipment! You're gonna be sorry you left me in here yo-\"\n\n\"SHUT UP!\" Zanatos screamed, seething anger washing into Rain as his friend lost it. \"Shut the fuck up man, you're done. You killed one of their people when all we wanted was a fucking bacta tank! You're dead!\"\n\n\"Guys stop arguing! We need to figure out a way out of here!\" Rain tried to say, voice lost in the wave of shouting that followed.\n\n\"Oh yeah well if I'm dead I'm taking you with me!\" WaguWagu fired back, \"Don't think I don't know exactly how to get you killed, you hear me?!\"\n\n\"I fucking swea-\" Zanatos started before being cut off as the floor of the plasma cages flooded with electricity, shocking the three of them into submission.\n\n\"If you keep this up you'll be dead even before Nala sentences you!\" one of the guards laughed.\n\nZanatos gripped his fists tight, knuckles white, as he settled into a meditation pose, \"None of you talk to me. We're done WaguWagu.\"\n\nRain and WaguWagu lay down, neither of them speaking as the guards eyed them, waiting for an excuse to electrify the floors again. Eventually, night came and the three of them fell into silent, restless sleep.\n\n***\n\n***And that's the end of Sessions 3/4! Bit abrupt I know, but I want to try and keep to the 2 sessions/post if I can and the 2nd ran short this time around.***",

        "text": "So, some background info, our group is an irregular unit in the Free Rassalhague Republic during the Ronin Wars. If that's gibberish to you don't worry, our current situation is that some mercenary units came in to cause trouble on FRR planets but got mauled, and are now trying to find and capture a backwater where they can rebuild because they have nowhere else to go, and we've been tasked to evict them. The week before I was absent due to real life things, and I came back to find that not only did my unit have a hell of a fight against the force recon units from the latest mercenaries to show up (known as the Dragonslayers), one of our pilots was critically injured when her mech's cockpit was crushed. \n\nThis would not do at all, lets move onto the crew. \n\n* The unit's command mech is a modified Star League vintage [Highlander](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/0/04/Highlander.jpg/501px-8xs5ak3zew1bl56fvhefbai45fx9127.jpg?timestamp=20170304220712) named *Blackout*, the ancient mech commands attention and respect with its LRM20, rare gauss rifle, twin medium lasers, and SRM4, the electronic warfare suite then makes proper communication nigh impossible for its enemies. The pilot's skills are built around long range fighting, forgoing direct stat boosts in exchange for halved range penalties. \n* Our second-in-command mech on the battlefield is a modified [Thunderbolt](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/f/f4/3025_thunderbolt.jpg/478px-5z06lhxazmoth7k202w87imm24a2oa8.png?timestamp=20130421084450) we call *Viking One*, the Thunderbolt carries double heat sinks to manage the heat from its ER large laser and battery of medium lasers, allowing it to continuously put out ruinous amounts of laser fire, while the pilot is explicitly specialized in driving the mediums home as often as possible.\n* In the backline we have a modified [Longbow](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/9/9c/Lgb-12c_longbow.jpg/586px-aufvuz0r18h9cewerv7jdpejpw6dvbn.jpg?timestamp=20141107020154) called *Storm*, a besieged mech that has had a very rough and tumble life, it carries batteries of LRM15s and five medium lasers for close-in defense, despite the frequent beatings it takes it is an extremely credible threat at any range with a competent but non-specialized pilot.\n* For this mission our usual close-in brawler opted to bring a modified [Cyclops](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/2/24/3025_Cyclops1.jpg/383px-t3idgf27l52kerxe7i9g18i9pvbseqz.png?timestamp=20130421091251), carrying an ultra-autocannon/5, twin particle projection cannons, and a battery of medium lasers, even in the hands of one of our greener pilots a very potent combatant.\n* Our flanker exchanged his usual Assassin for a [Grasshopper](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/5/5a/3050U_Grasshopper.jpg/697px-qad0papm260j8erg338c8zftgvz3ssn.png?timestamp=20110118184228), carrying a single PPC and a battery of medium lasers, his mech brought extensive firepower to bear with excellent agility.\n* The aforementioned casualty was right back on the field with a new cybernetic arm, and once again fighting from our extensively modified [Charger](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/8/8f/3025_Charger1.jpg/392px-m7snuu42p9dnt177jwobkm2dcmie9d0.png?timestamp=20130421092345), the *Bully*, with twin PPCs, twin SRM racks, and a generous number of heat sinks this Charger is reasonably fast while bringing crushing power to bear at any range.\n* Last but not necessarily least we also had an unmodified [Scorpion](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/9/9e/Scp-12s_scorpion.jpg/800px-scw991q3vk7wppwtmhec7jygbpnnnfm.jpg?timestamp=20141107201401), small, wiry, and with a healthy punch, the Scorpion was easily overshadowed by the other flamboyantly modified mechs in our company but a valuable asset in combat all the same with its PPC and SRM6.\n\nOur mission is simple, the Dragonslayers wish to establish a base in a nearby canyon, we will stop them before they can dig in. As luck would have it we arrive at the same time as the Dragonslayer construction crews. The mercenaries have brought a healthy force of mechs, a [Phoenix Hawk](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/4/40/Pxh-3pl_phoenix_hawk.png/356px-f0in0bztxgcip2f98v2jbeqosm3ueot.png?timestamp=20110121212552), [Banshee](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/5/5e/Banshee_1E.jpg?timestamp=20121111152256), [Trebuchet](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/2/2e/3050U_Trebuchet.jpg/665px-91ehui9v28kt66omd0og9uvgcr4jpx6.png?timestamp=20110118183512), [Marauder](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/b/b2/3025-Marauder-Classics.png/437px-shkdnf42bkoht6zer79q0d2y4rdq772.png?timestamp=20160615211543), [Guillotine](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/b/b1/Guillotine.jpg/516px-02f1hdkm319jno7qs4hmz72vamdi0r8.jpg?timestamp=20170304220155), [Quickdraw](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/6/6b/3050U_Quickdraw.jpg/651px-buio2sfc75dgvwttzqj0ymqspmfpi4i.png?timestamp=20110118183830), and [Dragon](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/e/ec/3025_Dragon1.jpg/486px-pqpshewjr6f2aqt3bxeohilh41rh63u.png?timestamp=20130421095338) stand against us. \n\nThe Dragonslayers immediately charge at us at full speed, hoping to close the distance with our long range mechs quickly as one of our lances marches into the valley and the other jump jets down from atop a canyon wall. Several of the mechs in front of us are the very same ones we saw last week, which makes this a grudge match. The order comes out to form a firing line at our current position as Blackout broadcasts the simple announcement \"Welcome to the jungle kids\" and flicks on the ECM, scrambling the enemy's communication systems. To their credit the loss of coordination didn't break their charge, the Guillotine lead the way and was the first to receive a hail of fire, a torrent of LRMs saturated the ground all around it as a lucky shot from the ERLL scythes into its torso, drawing first blood.\n\nAs the Guillotine staggers under the hail of missiles and PPC bolts, the Quickdraw and Phoenix Hawk overtake it, our fire discipline momentarily falters as our next volley of fire splits in three different directions, but the split fire is rewarded as the Quickdraw's engine is compromised by a lucky blow (the same fate it suffered last week) and the Phoenix Hawk's arm is instantly sheared off by a gauss slug, while the Guillotine doesn't suffer any such spectacular damage, it nonetheless is savaged by a volley of fire from the Cyclops and Scorpion. The enemy is not as effective at this range as we are, but they still make a concerted effort to focus their fire into Storm, withering away the support mech's armor, there's no time to worry about that though, the Grasshopper is ordered to shift to our left and engage the Phoenix Hawk and Quickdraw up close.\n\nOne could excuse us for our concentration on the three immediate threats, but then somebody asks \"what about the Banshee?\" and sure enough the lumbering assault mech is on an inexorable advance towards us, and is now within weapons range. Letting an assault mech known for its bare knuckle brawling abilities within arms length of our lances is bad for all of us, so the order is given to shift fire onto the Banshee, and the next wave of fire is split between the Banshee and the *still* confident Phoenix Hawk, the latter loses their other arm, and with it all of their weapons, while the former powers through the hail of bullets and missiles, joining its allies in pelting Storm with fire.\n\nNow Storm is a tough mech, but really not built for this kind of consistent punishment, its engine sputters and dies under the constant barrage, sending the still otherwise intact hulk tumbling down to the canyon floor, its missiles silenced. Most might consider this a huge blow to us, but with the Phoenix Hawk rendered impotent, the Quickdraw venting plasma into its own innards, and the Guillotine being down to willpower and spite to hold itself together, we really weren't worried. We definitely weren't worried after the Bully's next shot decapitated the Banshee, instantly removing the still mostly intact assault mech from the equation as another volley of fire slammed into it, in their confusion from the ECM blanket the enemy couldn't even tell their CO had just been reduced to a bloody smear.\n\nWith that out of the way it devolved into a turkey shoot, the Grasshopper pursued the Quickdraw and Phoenix Hawk as they attempted to disengage along the flank, putting the battered and dismembered Hawk out of its misery and bludgeoning the crippled Quickdraw into submission in a winner-take-all knife fight. Back on the frontline our fire shifted back to the Guillotine and onto the Centurion, the Dragon, Trebuchet, and Marauder still totally spared our wrath. The Centurion almost instantly disintegrates under our concentrated fire, and the Guillotine collapses under another barrage from the Cyclops and Scorpion before the Cyclops marches out and puts a metal boot through the 'tine's chest to make sure it stays down.\n\nBy this point just over a minute of actual fighting has transpired and we have already outright killed 4 mechs while only suffering a single loss ourselves, so the enemy decides discretion is the better part of valor and turns to withdraw. The Bully quickly put an end to that notion though, another PPC bolt slammed into the Marauder's cockpit, although it didn't decapitate it, it threw the Marauder off balance and the successive volley of massed fire sent it tumbling onto the ground, where it landed on and crushed its own cockpit.\n\nNow the Dragon and Trebuchet were still undamaged, but they could recognize a FUBAR situation when they saw one, and the Quickdraw had no chance of escaping from the Grasshopper unless the Grasshopper let him, so the surviving three mechs accepted the futility of their situation and, after a meager 90 seconds of battle, surrendered unconditionally. Marching just a little bit further to where the Dragonslayers had deployed their engineering team, we explained the management change to the engineers, who hadn't had time to even begin construction of anything more robust than a tent, and told them to carry on with the initial construction plan.\n\nOur own engineers reported that we had expended more tons of ammunition than armor, and of the 5 enemy mechs that weren't unrecognizable smears on the ground only one needed repairs more extensive than new armor and a cockpit. Storm's husk was recovered and salvageable, and the convenient discovery of an ammo truck full of LRMs in the engineering team almost made up for all of our LRM expenditures. The utter turkey shoot we had put the Dragonslayers on the receiving end of might have been a powerful message, if we had allowed any of them to escape and spread it. We weren't there to scare mercs though, we were there to remove them, and even without a base they weren't quite done on this planet yet.",

        "text": "To give some preface, all of this occurred during my first Shadowrun campaign. My roommate explained me the rules and I was pretty interested so over my Christmas break I used the money I was given to purchase the setup for the tabletop game. Ya know, pdfs for viewing and reference, maps, markers and dice (had to order about 400 mini d6's, good times) and one of my players purchased some dice cups for us. So we were all ready to go once they made some characters and I explained the base rules. \n\nFor those of you who don't know what Shadowrun is, the tabletop takes place in a cyberpunk futuristic world where businesses essentially control everything. Unlike DnD, the player is by no means special, and can easily be replaced by anyone else. This means if they refuse a job, it will most likely be taken by someone else ASAP. In addition, the game is mainly compromised of small missions that involve illegal stuff (robbing, killing people for money, all that good stuff). Since this was really a test campaign, I'm not really too focused on developing plot this semester since we are all learning the game (I prefer learning over story currently). Furthermore, speaking of story, the game is really player driven, where people need to plan for the runs (jobs) and be prepared to gtfo if any cops show up. So there are a lot of lulls where as a GM you can kind of chill and just do enemy rolls and planning ahead is way nicer since you have control over which runs are available than DnD in my opinion. \n\nOkay, with that out of the way let's proceed with the meat of this thing. The one run that got out of hand really quickly.\n\nSo we all roll up to the study room ready for the next run. I offer them two choices and an ongoing thing. The first option was a laid back robbery mission, where they were going to steal the last piece of coal from a museum and get paid once they brought it to the broker. The second was a caring sibling who wanted to see the demise of the most basic white boy ever to grace meta-humanity (the various races in the world are all considered meta-human bc game) who would beat the shit out of their younger sister. Naturally I expected them to choose the stealing mission, however they sought the assassination quest instead. \nSo the setup for the mission was simple, they were given a digital picture of the fuckboi's face and the general location that he was in and that was it. The way they killed him was up to them, but there was a bonus incentive to kill him as subtly as possible. So with that said, what they managed was pretty damn subtle. \n\nThe first plan was to roll up to the Catholic School this boi went to and they tried at night to see if they could get any information. They tried to use magic to sneak in and learned it didn't work when they went into the school and our tech guy learned that they keep the servers in limbo when no one is there. So they wait until morning and in real life the next week.\n\nSo we again roll up to the study room to continue what I think is a solid plan. They considered a local poison to kill his ass and use everyone to get it the boy. However, through some basic perusing, they learned the boy had a Christian Mingle account and got to see what his tastes were (blonde hair, blue eyes, nice tits and of course DTP, down to pray). Naturally they also saw his facebook where his mother was Mother Starbucks and his father was the lord himself Jeebus. His statuses were pretty raunchy, mostly consisting of racist banter and clickbait articles. \nSo of course the old plan was scrapped. \n\nInstead they decide to fucking catfish this child and use the face to face-sculpt into a basic white girl and wear a cheerleading outfit that showed off legs among other things. He critically glitched to resist being into the picture and once it was sent to him, immediately he creams his jeans while sitting in the family living room. Good times... After some more critical glitching the boy agrees to meet our \"girl\" in the park at 9 pm alone...\n\nSo naturally, the druid decides to turn our troll brothers into attack dogs (one a corgi and the other a doberman) to kill this kid. Once it's confirmed he's alone, the doberman rushes and fucking one-shots this guy. \n\nOverall I think the one thing that baffles me the most is that we went from a pretty wholesome plan of poison to catfishing with a side of murder.

        "text": "Taken from a D&amp;D like adventure RP forum that I used to be a regular at for a couple years, until I eventually disliked what it had become, which was a sex simulator. Enjoy!\n\nSetting: In the lands of Myrian and Telisia, two groups, Mimics, parasites that had taken control of humans, and created their own personality from the parasite, and humans (and humanoids) were separated by a massive wall, cutting the land in half. Myrian was the land of man and the living, while the mimics inhabited the land of Telisia, which was still very much alive and teeming with fauna. Character players are known as \"Warriors\" or if they've been lorded by the admin, \"Lords\"\n\nEris had come from the northern land, like many mercenaries, seeking fortune in the land of Myrian, which, due to the impending threat just over the wall, had much need for Knights errant, as all the other knights that were local had joined one of the Churches, mostly the blue. The Blue church was in charge of hunting down Mimics in Myrian, while the Red church handled research and spells used to combat them. Eris had no qualm with fighting other humans, but instead was much better at one thing. Eris was a guardian, which meant he did not hunt men, but something equally as terrible. \n\nMonsters.\n\nMasters of the poleaxe, Guardians were the protectors of the people from things that had no ability to follow the law. Decked in massive armor that kind of resembled Havel the rock, they were menacing, and the most protected warrior, but not quick.\n\nWhile he was no exorcist, Eris was adept in killing creatures, especially those of which would often plague farms and villages. Anything that could bleed, Eris believed he could kill. At least that's what he had thought in theory.\n\nEris' first stop was in the snow topped mountains in northern Myrian, a small town known as Karaya, whose lord, a fellow known as Dubes, was known to be particularly brutal, as he was basically the customs and immigration from the northern realms. Eris, however, was not rabble from the north trying to get more food in his stomach (the northern realms were rather barren, and relied on fishing and the short months of spring, summer, and fall to feed a massive population) but was instead there to solve the ever evolving problem of monsters. \n\nDubes alerted Eris to a string of Frost creatures plaguing the mountain village, that would often come down and pummel the towns food caravans, causing much of the populace to die from famine. Eris quickly donned his armor, grabbed his poleaxe, and marched off to kill these creatures.\n\nAnd promptly got bogged down in the snow. \n\nEris waited hours until another group coming from the north. Another warrior, a Guardian, came to his aid, and after telling the other guardian of the hunt he was on, he decided to aid Eris in his epic hunt. The guardian's name was Julius, and he would go on to become one of Eris' greatest allies\n\nEris and Julius go onto the hunt, and bring back several heads of the frost trolls to Dubes. Dubes, being thoroughly impressed with the Guardian's ability to fight creatures, allows them access to the northernmost realms. If they wish to enter Mid-Myrian, they'd have to appease the lord of the mid-realms, known as Lucifer.\n\nDeciding that the north did need a bit of cleaning up, Julius and Eris decided to give their word to Dubes that they would stay as long as there were monsters, and would return when there were more, if need be. As most Guardians, or any warriors for that matter, rarely stayed in the Northern Realms, so Dubes accepted their offer. For their services, they'd get a tidy bit of gold, boarding, and food, as well as an official knightship to the Northern Realms. \n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months, before it soon became apparent that there wasn't much left to kill in the northern realms. Eris and Julius thanked Dubes for his hospitality, and quickly set off for the largest city in Myrian, Tresgarten.\n\nTresgarten was the gateway to the cornucopia of south Myrian. Almost all warriors got bogged down there, as the Lord of Tresgarten was a bit of a prick, and was also the most powerful Lord in all of Myrian. Lucifer would use lesser warriors to fuel his entertainment, as he'd pit them against one another, generally friends against friends in order to let them through. And if the fight wasn't up to his standards, he'd often have them killed by his own group of specialized warriors, which worked under the implied agenda of the Blue Church.\n\nAs was such, Julius and Eris decided to split up midway, and would link up after they made it through Tresgarten. While they hadn't fought humans, their brushes of battle with the creatures of the dark had honed their battle skills quite well. Their training had also taught them to fight against the much more erratic fighting styles of Mimics, which already gave them a slight advantage in battle against other warriors.\n\nEris made it to Tresgarten unharmed, and made his way into the city. It was made of giant sandstone pillars, and was a glistening jewel, an oasis in the deserts that plagued the non-snowy north. \n\nThere was a line of warriors, and somewhere in the line, he saw the telltale sign of Julius: A massive pole axe sticking above the heads of those using swords, axes, spears, and flails. Eris and Julius were the only Guardians in the group. Suddenly, he saw a familiar face, as Dubes rode out from the gates. He motioned for Eris and Julius to follow him, and they walked in. Perhaps they did not have to deal with the trial by combat?\n\nAlmost as soon as they entered the city, they were ambushed by the Knights of the Blue Church. Several Wraith (Assassin like warriors, carrying a short sword, as well as adept in poison daggers) and groups of Honor-Guards (Knights using shields and short sword, or a long sword) descended upon the trio. A crowd of bystanders and Warriors formed, as Eris, Julius, and Dubes were surrounded, and out of the crowd walked Lucifer.\n\n\"Hello Dubes,\" Said Lucifer, an Honor-Guard himself. \"Trying to smuggle warriors in again?\"\n\n\"These warriors have done good deeds for the kingdom, they have more than passed your test,\" Said Dubes, who received a short-sword to the calve.\n\n\"It's not about the test, its about entertainment,\" Said Lucifer, smiling. \"Since I like you Dubes, I will not make you fight, but one of these two must face my second.\"\n\n\"That's not a fight! That's a slaughter!\" shouted Dubes, and Lucifer smiled. \"Precisely.\"\n\n\"I will fight your second.\" Eris proclaimed, standing up. \"But give me your word that these men will not be harmed by you or the Blue Church's hand, and Dubes' wounds will be tended to.\"\n\n\"I am a man of my word,\" Lucifer said, smiling. \"They will not be harmed.\"\n\nEris was taken to the coliseum, which had been filled with warriors, also awaiting their fate. Some were a bit peeved that Eris had jumped the line ahead of them, some were relieved, as they could see what they were going to have to fight other than one another. Eris stepped out, and many were taken aback, wondering how a Guardian had survived this long out in the world alone. \n\nFrom the other side, Lucifer's champion took his spot. Instead of being a member of the regular caste of warriors, this one was obviously from the south. Wearing a lightweight wooden armor type, using a katana, he would be quick.\n\nBut a single blow of Eris' poleaxe would kill him. \n\n\"Today's battle is Eris, Guardian of The North, versus the Champion of the Lord, Ryu Ikagima!\"\n\nRyu was cocky, however, unless he was very lucky, and hit a chink in the armor of Eris, his blade would not be able to cut through him. However, on the flip side, he'd just have to wait until Eris was tired, and kill him then, as the sweltering heat, as well as the heavy armor and pole axe would tire him to the point of exhaustion.\n\nRyu quickly ran at Eris with his arms behind his back, sword inverted, and sliced at Eris' armor. To no avail. It bounced off of the side of the metal chest plate, and Ryu was taken off guard. Eris swung his axe around, and used the hammer side of his pole axe to bash Ryu in the face. Ryu, deciding the best course of action was to spin, dodged around the attack, and landed his blade on the right side of Eris' chestplate. Eris quickly clamped down on the blade with his right arm, and grabbed Ryu with the other, mercilessly headbutting Ryu into submission. Apparently, Ryu did not have the brains to let go of the blade, as he continued to take the punishment.\n\nWith each consecutive headbutt, Ryu's face became more and more disfigured from the metal helmet slamming against his head. Eventually, Ryu lost his grip on his sword, and fell limply to the ground. The crowd was in awe, as Eris grabbed his pole-axe, and lowered it to Ryu's neck. In an attempt to save his Champion's life, quickly raised his thumb.\n\nInstead, Eris slammed the axe down upon Ryu's neck, cutting his head clean off. The champion was dead. The silence was deafening, as Eris had most likely just sealed his death warrant. \n\n\"My name is Eris, Guardian of the North! and I will not abide by a corrupt government which uses blood-sport not as a punishment, but as a sport!\"\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nTell me if you guys would like to see more!

I didn't make the players didn't show their character sheets to each other, so as a big reveal at the campaign end he typed up the little gem below to mindfuck the other PCs. it was glorious, and the only time I've seen an evil character actually work in a good narrative.\n\nI play a lawful evil half-orc in a good/neutral PC pathfinder campaign. He isn’t axe crazy, in fact he’s fairly well liked in NPC towns. He deals fairly with people unless he suspects them of dishonesty. He is quite fond of the other PCs in his group. He creates far fewer problems than the chaotic neutral ranger who hates authority. He’s actually probably the least argumentative party member. He has nothing but contempt for people who proclaim a dedication to “Evil” and views the cliché death cult member or devil-worshipper as moronic for serving powers so clearly indifferent to the general fate of the world and their subordinates. He prefers good and neutral company because good and neutral neighbors tend to understand respect and community. He doesn’t have a secret basement full of dead children or a lair where he puts his Dr. Wiley pants on and dreams up convoluted world-domination schemes. He doesn’t see himself as evil, he’s just a guy willing to do dirty work no one else will. He’d be far less threatening if he had any desire to do anything openly evil.\n\nLizardmen primitives causing a nuisance with their gobbledygook fertility chants a few miles outside town? Get a small team together, crush their camp at night, and dump the bodies in the swamp. They smelled as bad as their shrieking sounded. They were scaring off merchant caravans and hinting that bribes would be needed to make them leave. Can’t be letting a bunch of mouth-breathing savages spread word that the town is weak and stupid enough to pay off any cave-dwellers willing to make a nuisance. Now no one is running around spreading word town can be extorted, and folks are happy to accept vague indications that the lizards just left. It’s a win-win. And why shouldn’t people be happy? The lizards would have cheerfully been raiding if they thought they had the numbers, and everyone knew it. It was us or them and our side just had people willing to take care of us.\n\nNoble refuses to allow party access to his library? Could kidnap his kid. People comply when that happens. But the noble won’t forget that. That’s a loose end, not a solid option. Maybe the noble needs something done. Something not very nice to someone who deserves it. But, everyone deserves it really- some people just try to act self-righteous. It’s nothing personal, but things need doing, and if the paladin was allowed to decide everything nothing would get done. Better to let him be happy- some bad people get smashed, happens every day, no reason to raise stress levels. Don’t misunderstand, the paladin is a friend- he can’t get things done, but there’s no one more loyal. Being treacherous and around treacherous people is bad for business and your lifespan. If everyone hates and distrusts you, you’ll be the one getting smashed. No one wants to deal with a known cheat. Playing honest is much easier. A quick buck isn’t worth a lifetime of looking over your shoulder while loose ends hunt you down. \n\nPeople who leave loose ends are either suckers or mentally weak. The paladin always talks about mercy- but when you defeat and humiliate people, don’t expect them to be your friends. The only thing on a sane person’s mind would be getting even. Cleaning up these loose ends is always a pain- like that mercenary captain. The guy wouldn’t stop loudly swearing vengeance for his defeat, but everyone wanted to give him life in prison. What if he got out of prison? It was us or him. A discreet bribe to the prison guard, a vial of poison in his soup, and bam, problem solved, things done, everyone wins. Except the mercenary captain, but he had already lost \n\nThe party wouldn’t understand any of this, but he does what he needs to, as much for himself as for them. They’ve been his steadfast allies for a long time now, and they might waffle around a bit with semantic morals too much, but no one’s perfect. He does a lot for them- most of them lack the backbone necessary to really get things done- but they help him in other ways. He wouldn’t die for them, but he sure as hell wouldn’t willingly betray them. He knows torture, and that past a certain point anyone will say anything, but he’d be sure to misdirect and mislead as much as possible up to that point. He knows his friends wouldn’t trust him as much if they knew everything he did, but he doesn’t pretend to be some holier-than-thou beacon of morality. His friends know he gets things done. Maybe not exactly how efficient he really is, but they have an idea. The people who do what he does and pretend to be better are the real problem. Delusional people are scary because they can do anything. He isn’t like them. He isn’t a bad guy. He isn’t delusional. He just gets things done.\n\nThis guy is all about pragmatism, with no consideration of good or evil at any point along the way. He has Machiavellian efficiency, and goes for the long-term play. He deals in absolutes and doesn’t allow potential threats, no matter how minor or imagined, to live. He lacks mercy, ability to meaningfully self-critique beyond worked/did not work, and anything mildly resembling guilt or shame. His high learning curve, ability to conform, and complex mental gymnastics are what make him truly terrifying. Evil isn’t scary when it comes charging at you in a loincloth, waving an axe, and screaming. Evil is scary when it sits next to you at the bar, smiles, and offers to pick up your tab.",

        "text": "This story starts around level 10, and the party's encounter with a giant scouting group, who's fledgling wizard (lvl 5-ish)  in her possession some scrolls (I was meaning to pass onto the party's wizard), including one of Power Word Kill. I intended this to be an easy fight, giving them some expendable items to buff the party for a few upcoming fights. The party consisted of a spell-less ranger, rogue, paladin, witch (named Lynessa) and wizard (the latter two were becoming somewhat close, after being opposed to each other over differing opinions of magic and eventually warming to one another), and they had been following the group for a while until the four giants stopped for a rest. I started counting rounds as the group moved into position for an ambush, each round the giantess would use read magic on one of the four scrolls with glee, except for the last, which I told the party she looked at with utter contempt.\n\nSo the party attacks, and it's going well, despite the party's wizard taking a crit to the face. Then, in a panic, the giantess wizard grabs a random scroll, since they are all more powerful than her spells. Roll a d4, and she snatches PWK. Natural 20 on activation, and the wizard makes a natural 1 on the fort save. He crumbles to the ground right next to Lynessa, who frenzies and attacks without relent. She rips the throat from the giantess, and then, with the realization that reincarnation can't bring back the wizard (and after the paladin tried the ultimate mercy, failing due to it being a death effect, since I like to describe spells and not say the name unless identified by a party member), she turns and reincarnates the giant. I roll, and the giant comes back as an elf. But she lost all her prepared spells, her spellbook is on her dead giant body, she's unarmored (and unclothed), massively weaker than before, and now this elf witch who was once so much smaller is towering above her.\nThe witch goes on an angry rant, promising at the end to throw her to the giant tribe she comes from as a distraction (to which I inform her will be an evil act). At the end of it, the witch burns both the spellbook and scrolls.\n\nFast forward a few sessions, the wizard returns with an oracle, party still has the giantess-turned-elf as prisoner, and are unsure what to do with her, though they have decided to give her an elven name, and decide to call her Calyera. Lynnessa and \"Caly\" have talked together extensively, and Caly expressed great regret, having original not wanted to take a life. Eventually another couple sessions) they actually become fast friends, and Lynessa offers to buy a new spellbook and some lessons, as well as new spells, even passing along some of the former items that belonged to the wizard, and I go ahead and say that she is Lynessa's cohort, though I am the one handling the leveling, for the moment.\n\nSoon, they are faced with a daunting task--facing Caly's former tribe. They have been increasingly violent, and even Caly admits that she believes her former family was doing things that she couldn't believe they would do, but has seen the evidence. They go to face the giants, and find that the tribe leader (of course, I made it her father, drama!) has been possessed by some unworldly power. This was probably going to be one of the most difficult fights I would put in the campaign, with giants around and a super buffed giant with demonic powers. The paladin goes down, the smite good racking his form. The oracle is doing everything he can to make his way towards the bleeding out paladin (who could not make a saving throw to literally save his life), but is constantly blocked by giants.\nThe demonic giant steps towards Lynessa, who is critically low on health, and swings--only for Caly to jump in the way (Bodyguard/In Harm's Way feats). She's taken to negative hit points instantly, but not dead. Oracle heals Lynessa a bit, but she just tries to heal Caly, but fails the concentration check, and the giant attacks. Now, with one hit point remaining, (and with a well placed aid another arrow from the ranger and a decent sneak attack from the rogue, the witch blasts away the giant...which starts a chain reaction of exploding negative energy. Lynessa carries the Caly as quickly as she can, but with a strength of 9, she isn't moving quickly, until the paladin, whom the oracle finally was able to heal, easily lifts both the two casters, and they safely make it out...except the rogue, who point blank ate the negative energy blast, and since he had greater invisibility cast on him, no one could see him to bring him out.\n\nNext session, the former rogue asks if he could play Caly, and both I and Lynessa's player agree. And even though I allowed him to level her as he wished, with feats and spells, (and a few months of training to catch up in level), he still elected to keep her supportive spells and the feats that saved the witch's life.\n\nAnd that's how a bitter enemy became close friends with the party and finally a PC.",

        "text": "In a game comprised of good and neutral characters, the party had begun slipping to more brutal and morally questionable means of accomplishing their goals. While the end goals were in the purpose of good, my ranger could no longer morally justify staying in a group in which he felt was beginning a descent into evil causing him to leave, and me needing a new character.\n\nThe group at this point had amassed a decent bit of power and influence holding a keep next to a capital and working primarily for the council in charge of said city after having saved them from a demonic threat. The group however was far from cohesive with many differing goals and most members trying to get what they wanted regardless of the group.\n\nIn enters my lawful evil rogue. Him and his partners in crime were inseparable from birth. As they grew up and into a life of crime they all learned how their strengths worked together. A muscle, a thief, and my character the mouthpiece. He saw crime as a business as any other. A series of numbers that represented risk and reward. Sure shoving a man against a wall in an alley would get you a sack of gold, but attracting the guards, having your image be that of street-side thugs, and turning locals against you? Not nearly as wise of an investment as carefully planing the hostile takeover of a business with favors, threats, sabotage all the while keeping the common man on their side and the guards in their pocket.\n\nAfter having stepped on the toes of a much more powerful criminal organization, he was betrayed with the thief having murdered the muscle and pinning it on him on the behest of the much larger organization. On the run he hears about a powerful group of people who have connections with very powerful people, an ability to garner many more, and well liked by the people as well as the ability to protect him from physical threats.\n\nSo he joins the group intent on making it the most morally respectable group around with a web of powerful allies and the unwavering support of the people and governments at large. Over the course of sessions he diminishes and eventually ends the constant theft between group members and builds more trust and respect between group members. Also reigning in their baser impulses and focusing with every action to do the most morally good possible. Everybody jokes he'd be a much better paladin than rogue.\n\nAll the while between sessions he begins trying to establish connections and learn what's been happening in the criminal underworld. He learns that his former friend has become a lieutenant under the organization that he'd annoyed, which confirms for sure he's been betrayed and it's not merely a misunderstanding. He felt the only way a group can function is trust among its members. The only code one needed to follow was honor among thieves. If one did not honor that code, they needed to be destroyed completely and utterly. He'd hunt this man to the ends of the earth.\n\nAt one point the group fights a giant flaming skull which once destroyed eventually reconstitutes itself after a period of time unless destroyed with holy water. After the group defeats it, my rogue tells them to go on and deal with the next threat while he gets clerics to destroy it for good. He instead brings it to a bakery he's bought and continually grinds it to dust.\nTime passes and I've learned my former friend is in the city. Luckily the location he's at I've suspected he might come to and have a few people already there. I manage to get the flaming skull powder snuck into the kitchen before they're to eat, and have it baked into bread and it's placed on their table. At the same time in another room I cover it with ritualistic demonic symbols surrounding a summoning circle.\n\nThose who eat the bread suddenly at one point begin to feel a horrible tearing pain in their stomachs moments before flaming skulls pieces tear out of them and coalesce in front of them. During the chaos I steal all the documents I can and set a fire in the far end of the house, and meet up with the party coming to the rescue and destroy the flaming skull.\n\nUnfortunately nobody in the room survived that terrible fire and the flaming skull. The summoning circle proved to the council that that organization was involved in the occult and was an enemy of the state, and as they were sent packing, the documentation gave a very clear idea of where there was going to be a power vacuum in which my rogue could step into. \nWe were generously rewarded by the council for preventing what could have been an incredibly serious fire and even more loved by the city.\n\nThe group at the end of the session looked at me dumbfounded due to the fact that until that point in front of the group my character had had the moral flexibility of superman. And that readers is why lawful evil characters are so much fun\n\n**TLDR:** As lawful evil, reigned in the groups murder hobo tendencies and made them upstanding members of the community only to teach them that true evil is patient.",

        "text": "The game is Alternity, the setting a custom homebrew affair which had the modern world several decades into the future after a global collapse and dimensional portals opening to other planets in various places. There's a large number of different ideological factions fighting over territories, and our faction's capital city had numerous enemy factions descend on it like vultures.\n\nOur players are:\n\nGecko - psychic hobbit-lizard biomancer.\n\nDonut - latent psychic gun-nut and heavy weapons guy.\n\nDoc - cyborg doctor/medic\n\nAce - general all around infantryman, erstwhile mechanic.\n\nHaving just escaped a terrible ambush by gunship, teleporting power armor, and a long and tiring fighting retreat, our tiny squad is wounded and in need of medical care. The psychic lizard can seal up wounds but has a hard time healing the sort of serious mortal injuries many of us are carting around after some of the most intense combat of the campaign. However, the city is rather low on places we can safely hole up for emergency field surgery.\n\nWhilst tromping away, our pursuers peel off and leave us alone we continue on and discover we're in a sort of dense low-rise subburb that is largely empty of inhabitants. No enemies, no civilians, just empty and clear. The whole neighborhood is completely silent too - not even the sound of birds. No corpses either, oddly. There are some odd brown stains and the occasional pile of biological goo that looks like crap. So we continue to search for a good spot for Doc to patch us up, and manage to find a fairly clean looking kitchen in one of the houses we can use. Doc's field surgery combines with Gecko's biomantic healing over the next day or two to patch us up and we're in fighting shape, if not fully healed.\n\nWe check where we are on our map, and start examining the elevated highway for the shortest route back to base camp. We start moving along one morning, getting up on the highway and continue along for a few hours, the GM making a big deal about how itchy and uncomfortable the journey is. Soon we come across an enemy patrol tooling down the highway in their vehicle. We hide behind a car wreck and Gecko the Psychic Lizard convinces the patrol that there's nothing to see here, but they break for lunch. Shit. Gecko keeps up the illusion and we all stay prone behind the car trying to keep his job easy. We're stuck in one position for some time, waiting for these guys to leave, the GM belaboring us with a long and boring description of their lunch, which he punctuates by describing the hot sun beating down on us and how itchy our suits are. Finally, after half an hour, they start packing up to go, and Donut scratches his leg. And a chunk of flesh falls off. Oh *shit*.\n\nEveryone stares for a moment before recoiling in shock and horror. As people flinch away, the GM gleefully describes our flesh sloughing off inside out suits in response to our rapid motion. Oh god, Oh god, Oh GOD.\n\n\"What the fuck is happening!?\" is the cry at the table. The GM has everyone make Resolve checks not to scream. As everyone has been stacking Resolve to deal with the constant wounds, we all managed to stifle our terrified screams until the patrol has moved on. Doc studiously checks his internal logs and realizes we were performing surgery inside the zone where a bioweapon was released early in the conflict. We have some kind of flesh eating superbug which we have lovingly packed into our wounds by getting surgery in an infected area.  The party's only hope at this point is the biomancer, as only psychic healing can possibly clear this up before every member of the party dies.\n\n\"Save us Gecko!\" screams the party.\n\n\"I can't!\" he yells back. \"Psychic healing just does wounds, it doesn't do diseases!\"\n\n\"OH GOD, we're all going to die!\" screams the party, and every player starts blitzing through their sheets and books trying to find some way out of this near certain death situation.\n\n\"WAIT.\" cries Gecko, after long and tense minutes of searching. \"I've got this other skill which I haven't bothered to really master but it'll slow down the infection, even reverse it with enough applications. We're only going to get a couple extra hours on this first application though, and only if it sticks on everyone.\"\n\nThe lizard blows all of his psychic power points over the next couple hours staving off the disease for longer and longer periods of time and trying to fix our mangled bodies with psychic healing, while the party finds and breaks into a 7-11 to find something to disinfect their gear.\n\nYou'd think the story ends here. It doesn't. The party finds a bunch of alcohol in the back room, and some empty 50 gallon barrels in the basement. What follows is **thirty realtime minutes** of Gecko and Doc's players arguing over whether it will be more efficient to bring up the 50-gallon drums from the basement to dunk their bodies and gear in, or to bring the cases of whiskey downstairs to the drums. Ace and Donut finally tell them to shut the fuck up and force the other two to start carrying liquor into the basement, where they can't be seen through the glass storefront, and the party disinfects itself, finally ending the threat.",

However I woke up to a long message in my discord dm's and they read as follows:\n\nso I have good news and bad news\n\nthe good news is I made it to the top 8 on my first solo game\n\nthe bad news is the games chugs like a fratboy with a new liver at a kegger where the kegs are full of 100% grain alcohol\n\nbut Wenzel, how did you make it to top 8? you may ask.\ngood fuckin question. I don't think I can give you an honest answer that isn't \"By the grace of the old gods and the new.\"\n\nI started by changing all the settings to the lowest possible because getting past the title screen was already an issue. I made a happy looking black man with a huge afro that looked like it was made out of a blotch of the spray paint tool from MS paint, because I figured that would be noticeable enough for you trigger happy glue sniffers to not fill your pants and waste me every time you hear a footstep.\n\na few times I got stuck on a loading screen with only the ability to hear sound, like a russian mafia kidnap victim waiting to be shot in the back of the head when the engine stopped.\n\nWhen I finally managed to get into a game it loaded in with 5 seconds to spare before I was thrown into a plane and lagged my way across the countryside. \n\nfinally I decided to mash the f button and eject over nurgle knows where, since I had no idea where I actually was because the ground hadn't even loaded in yet.\n\nI know I'm supposed to have a parachute because I watched some videos of this game, but me, nope. My connection can't afford one. Instead I am greeted by the same 8bit jpeg of plane I've been staring at for a while until I hear the chute open sound and have suddenly teleported to the ground.\n\nIt takes about a solid 2 minutes before I can even move and I manage to struggle my ass to the only building in sight and when I say struggle I mean I couldn't take 6 steps without hitting -12 frames per second. \n\nThe building was a large hangar/warehouse thing which I think must have something in it right? \n\nHaha, no. \n\nNo it did not. \n\nThe only things I found were blue jeans and a red and white striped shirt. I was the 70's black man version of Where's Waldo... \n\nIt was all I could do to manage to make it to the circles by staring at the ground and running on blind faith and sound queues\n\nI would camp the very edge of the outer circle and pray nobody found me\n\nfor a while I was literally following someone doing the same thing\nbut I had no gun and every time I even thought about looking at something other than the ground my pc threatened to commit seppuku.\n\nyet somehow, as bullets cracked in the distance (how long ago, who knows, thanks to lag) I belly crawled my way forward at a rate that had the barrier nipping at my balls on a few occasions.\n\nby the time I made it to 8 players the ring was only roughly as wide as a football field and after 4 minutes of sheer amazement at making as far as I did, I had to watch helplessly as a man with a shotgun teleported his way up the hill. \n\nhe stared into hopeless pleading eyes as they struggled to render the pixelated death they gazed upon. And before the game could even play the sound effect, Waldo's time had ended.\n\nSo yeah, I probably won't play again until I can sort out why the game plays like a quadraplegic turd suffering from a brain hemmorage, but it's good to know I could beat 92 other players by being unable to play the game.",

        "text": "Hey GameTales,\n\nYesterday's D&amp;D session was amazing, and one scene was so good I just had to write about it. Prompted by my players, who took a liking to a particularly bad-ass NPC, I wrote a short bit of fiction from that particular enemy's POV. I tried to keep everything in-character, so there's nothing about rolls are whatever, but I hope you enjoy this nonetheless!\n\nSetting: An abandoned mansion in a medieval fantasy homebrew world, occupied by a group of rebels, trying to overthrow the current government of their barony. The PCs have been sent to reclaim the mansion (\"I mean, no one was using it, but it belongs to us, dammit, we can't have those bandits use it as a forward base!\").\nWe recently introduced a new player to the group. To explain why he was there, we came up with a double-agent storyline, which allowed the new PC to join the party in the first encounter, which took place a while before this story.\nThe PCs have set up a bottleneck in one particular room, but allowed one of the enemies to alarm a second group of fighters in an adjacent room.\nThat's all you need to know to understand this, I think. Here we go.\n\nBurly, sitting on the dilapidated table they used for their ale kegs, drew back his arm, grunted, and threw.\nThe apple soared, but strayed a little to the left. Jack snatched it out of the air nonetheless. He could feel that the fruit was starting to grow pulpy, and frowned. They had finally found something to pass the time, in this rotting heap of a ruin, and now the fruit was going to spoil the fun. \n\n‘C’mon Jack, are you gonna throw that thing or what?’\nHe started to raise the apple, ready to toss it back, but froze midway through the movement. Had he heard something?\n‘Hey, Ja-‘ Burly started, but Jack cut him off.\n‘Everybody shut up.’\nJack did not exactly have seniority, or rank, but he did have respect. Across his chest he wore a bandolier, which held a total of seven different daggers, of various design. Each one had belonged to someone Jack had killed, and there were plenty of sheathes left. Five of the seven had belonged to Baronial Guard troops, and the other Leeches here knew that damn well. Jack the Knifer was a name that carried respect, and that meant that when he told everybody to shut up, everybody shut up.\nHis skill with throwing knifes helped, too. Scary good, Burly had whispered, when last Jack had felt the need to practise and/or remind people of what he could do. \n\nEveryone was looking at him – Burly, a fairly fresh recruit; black haired Ha’Ralla, who had been fighting for the cause for about as long as Jack had himself, and even Ayth had come crawling from his dungheap corner, carrying at least half of its stink, fingering the handle of his mace. Burly was reaching for the metal rod he liked to swing at people, Jack noted.\n\nHe held up a hand, straining his ears to hear something over that Reaver-sent storm that was busy pulling the panes from the already damaged roof of their villa-outpost.\n\nThen he heard it again: someone pounding on the door to the armoury, the one that had been blocked ever since part of the roof had caved in. Three quick knocks, then nothing… And then he heard something else, something distinctly troubling.\n‘Everyone, with me,’ he said, drawing his own two knives.\nHa’Ralla unslung her crossbow as well. ‘What is it?’\n‘Guests,’ he said, and he was on his feet, rushing for the hallway door. \nOut in the hall, the sounds of battle were clearer. Jack sped up, clutching a dagger in each hand. Behind him, he could hear the others keeping up.\n\nHe rounded the corner, and the blades were flying before he had consciously registered the targets. A man in an uncomfortably short robe, at the end of the hallway, by the stairs, locked eyes with him. Nearby stood a red-haired woman with a bitch of a halberd, and an actual fucking armoured dog at her side. A bald bladesman and an archer stood on the other side of the door that led to the armoury, keeping Jack’s allies pinned. Cross was already there, far too close to the intruders yet readying a spell. Someone, Jack could not see who, was taking a beating, pinned in the doorway. Someone else was on the floor, bleeding out.\n\nHis daggers struck the archer in the back, yet bounced off the armour he wore under his white fur cloak. Jack ground his teeth, and drew the next two daggers – a merchant’s guard and a Baronial officer.\nThings looked dark, Jack decided, before moving in to close the distance. \nAn orb of green, dripping glittering motes, crossed the span of the hallway in two seconds, and crashed into his side. Immediately, he could feel a burning pain eating into his flesh. The air carried a smell of burned leather, and something sharp, biting. He could barely keep himself from falling to a knee.\n\nAt that point, Burly and Ha’Ralla reached the corner. Club held high, the recruit surged forward, overcoming the din of battle with a shout of ‘JAAAAACK!’\nThe archer turned around, dropped his bow, and drew a longsword.\nCross was standing virtually at his side. He turned around, moved his lips, and snapped out an arm towards Jack. Behind him, he heard Ha’Ralla gasp, equal parts surprise and pain.\nFucking Voidbound traitor. But no matter, they could deal with him later. Jack pushed back the pain, and darted forwards with renewed, murderous intent. The first of his daggers sailed past his opponent, but the second hit him full in the chest. The archer stumbled backwards, knocking Cross into a third fighter. The turncoat wizard tumbled to the floor.\n\nThe dog, a creature of brown fur, red steel armour, and far too many fangs, surged towards them, leaping over the prone body of Cross. The fighter with the blade, recovered in an instant, was only a few paces behind.\n\nThere was a thwang as Ha’Ralla’s crossbow discharged a bolt, which disappeared into the melee. From the other end, that fucking half-dressed other wizard sent a small bolt of flame their way, which singed Jack’s shoulder before he fully registered it.\nCountless thoughts passed through his head, as he ran to close the distance, preparing the next set of blades – two soldiers on patrol. The resulting conclusion was grim. ‘Burly, with me. Ralla, get Arbald. Now.’\nWaving his rod, Burly almost overtook him. Him, Jack, the beast, and the bladesman, collided.\n\nHe caught the swing of the longsword with both of his daggers, and brushed it aside. Then he unleashed his own flurry of attacks, grinning like mad when he felt his blade connect. The swordsman cloak, he now saw, ended in a white wolf’s head, like some bestial crown.\n\nThe dance of longsword and daggers continued, even as Burly tried to fend off the armoured, slobbering horror. But it was working: he could hear Ha’Ralla running past them, rounding another corner, closing in on the Lieutenant’s door, out of sight from the combatants. Not for the first time, Jack the Knifer cursed Arbald and his petty frustrations, which had resulted in that insane barrier of silence, allowing the brute to focus on his paperwork and not notice a thing when they were under attack. Idiot. \n\nCross, that thrice cursed Baronial spy, saw it too, and shouted something. But no matter, it was going to work, they would –\nThe wolf-man spun, ducked, and was past him. Jack tried a wild cut, but missed. He turned to follow the man’s movement, raised his dagger, and saw Burly somehow manage to catch the man right in the chest, almost folding him like a piece of paper. But it didn’t work: the man spun again, and was around the corner, hot on Ha’Ralla’s heels.\n\nAt his side, the dog snapped at Burly, grabbed hold of his leg, tugging, shaking, snarling. The poor recruit’s screams took on a different tone. Jack could only take two steps in pursuit before Burly went down, after a final, bone-breaking tug. The dog, muzzle reddened, turned its gaze on him, and leapt.\n\nJack fell to the ground, pushed down by the combined weight of the creature’s body and armour. He could just about see around the corner. Ralla was reaching out, hand almost on the doorknob. Then she drew back, as if shocked, and that was all the delay the swordsman needed. Ha’Ralla died in a fountain of red, moments before Jack the Knifer could feel the beast’s fangs close around the back of his neck.",

        "text": "This is a story back from a Vampire: The Masquerade one shot I did with my colleges RPG club back in 2001.\n\nA little back story before I get into this; so the guy playing the Toreador always played goody two shoes characters. If he was a real person he would be the kid that ratted on you for drawing in your notebook when you were supposed to be paying attention in class.\n\nSo we are well into the session where all of sudden the Toreador decides to follow me out of the Sanctuary. Using OOC knowledge he wanted to get back at me because I caused an illusion that made him believe I was drinking blood from a bottle. And caused his character to get into trouble with the elder.\n\nSo he follows my character to a park where my character sits down at a camp fire and begins talking to a dog. This is not abnormal for my character because the dog follows my character everywhere except into the Sanctuary where he isn’t allowed. Well the Toreador decides to confront me, but plays the whole thing opposite to his character.\n\nWell the Toreador and I start getting into it, at this point my k-9 companion starts growling at me. Well the Toreador tells me to get my dog away from him before he hurts him. Well I just laugh and tell him that he isn’t my dog but my friend and he does not want to do that. Well at this moment he decides to shoot at the dog. The dog dodges really fast and the next thing you know there is no longer a dog standing in that spot but a 7 foot tall werewolf.\n\nSee when I created my character I took the Werewolf Ally background. And so my backstory was that my best friend was a Bone Gnawer who traveled around the world with my character. Including after his embrace. My werewolf friend would turn to a dog at night and run around with my character so no one would suspect anything and my character would keep watch while he slept at night. During the day he would keep an eye out while my character slept and would wander around and collect supplies we would need for our travels.\n\nWell when we were attacked by the Toreador we were just getting ready to make camp for the night. And so my GM took a quick break and we created the werewolf character. So once we got back we started the fight between the Toreador and the Werewolf. Needless to say the player was pissed at this point saying that his character would not have attacked it and trying to use OOC to back out. The whole table told him that he didn’t know it was a werewolf and he did attack so now he has to fight. Needless to say the fight didn’t last long and my character and the new werewolf NPC spent the rest of the night making it look like he just got caught by a pack of werewolves and made the mistake of fighting them.",

        "text": "**Why Helmets are a Good idea**\n\nLet me tell you a story, a story about why everyone should always buy a helmet.\n\nI doubt anyone really remembers it, but [Inquistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisitor_(game)) was the only thing on the block close to a 40k RPG for years. It was more of a 3-5 man skirmish game in 54mm scale, but it was remarkably ill defined. Dark Heresy is built largely off of the percentile dice system and hit locations used in Inquisitor merged with WFRP. Now, I loved me some Inquisitor, but I'm not going to pretend it was balanced. There was an ill-defined points system, but by and large the system let you do whatever the hell you wanted, and balance was somewhere in the realms of 3.5's caster/fighter dichotomy. Of course, it's community was tiny and its online presence minuscule, so horrific combinations were not well known.\n\nKnowing balance was generally bad however, we only played games where a GM was involved to make rule calls and veto OP combinations. Our GM lovingly crafted enormous arcs for us to go through, and my initial forays into the system where such that everyone had one character, and combined we made up the warband of an inquisitor. This was not how the game was meant to be played, but it made the game a touch more roleplay-esque and made it very simple for people to get into it since they only needed one 54mm mini.\n\nThe last time I played Inquisitor, our GM decided to go all out, and everyone got to bring their own 3-5 man warband for this campaign. Everyone wrote up some background for their Inquisitor (or equivalent) and the GM would set up matches between people with some individual fluff written out for each player. Mission briefing handouts were usually unique to each player, and he wrote about a page prior to the rules for the mission about why your inquisitor was here. And there were a lot of players.\n\nThe warbands that matter for this scenario, and their leaders' models:\n\n[Inquisitor Warwick](http://i.imgur.com/BagRSyu.jpg)  – Ordo Hereticus. EXTRA PURITAN, PURGE ALL HERESY. Psyker, power armor covering all locations but no helmet as per his model, in grand PC tradition. Bolt pistol and power sword. Backed up by a Stormtrooper and a sniper guardsman with a long-las.\n\n[Inquisitor Fiach](http://i.imgur.com/8xaPuxP.jpg) – Ordo Xenos. TOTALLY RADICAL, USE ALL THE TECH. Has a full carapace rig, wears an enclosed helmet with built in rangefinder. Only weapons are an autogun and his armored gauntlets. He's a fast, acrobatic fucker in his creepy xenotech carapace. Backed by a Rogue Trader in full power armor (all this xenos tech is his, covered by writ of trade) and a marksman gunslinger with a hunting rifle.\n\n[Inquisitor Spinelli](http://i.imgur.com/eE8JjbD.jpg) – Ordo Minoris. He was a former bureaucrat and his minor order was based around finding irregularities in paperwork. Has a pair of autopistols, his bionic eye is also a digi-flamer, his heavy overcoat is flak, and his skull is reinforced to accommodate his flamer/eye bionic. Fat little man, never sprints. Backed by a techpriest and a kroot (Filed forms X31-J and IRA-331, the hired alien is licensed and totally legal).\n\nWarwick's player missed the first session, and in the second session was thrown into a three way fight – the scenario had Warwick, Fiach and Spinelli at the center of the board, engaged in talks, while their warbands lurked at the board edges. The game starts as talks begin to break down between the Radical Xenos Inquisitor and the Puritan Hereticus, with Spinelli desperately trying to hold things together before it spirals into violence.\n\nFiach gives up reasoning with the puritan, wishes Spinelli the best, then turns and walks away. Warwick draws his bolt pistol. “HOLD HERETIC. You will stop and accompany me to conclave to answer for your heresies!”\n\nFiach pauses, but resumes walking.\n\n“One more step and I will shoot you where you stand!”\n\nFiach pauses again, and this time uses his acrobatics to kick up a nearby drainpipe and get on the roof of a low building. Warwick snaps off a shot but misses.\n\nFiach's gunslinger and Warwick's sniper have spent the entire leadup to this taking careful aim at the respective enemy inquisitors. When fire erupts, both snipers take their shots with multiple levels of aiming.\n\nNow let met tell you something about Inquisitor before continuing. Power armor is damage reduction 10 and carapace is damage reduction 6. Lasguns and autoguns do damage in the 2d6 range. Characters are considered to have their toughness value in wounds before going unconscious, and double that before dying. So your average T30 character can take 30 wounds before knocking out and 60 before dying. Aside from taking double your toughness in wounds after reduction by armor, the only other way to die is to take 4 critical hits to the head.\n\nGot it? It's about to be very relevant.\n\nThe guardsman nails Fiach in the head with a las-bolt, who shrugs off all of the damage with his helmet. The gunslinger pegs Warwick right in the head for an unimpressive level of damage, but a headshot that does damage automatically generates one round of stun, so Warwick is unable to move or act next turn.  Spinelli wisely retreats to his own board corner.\n\nWarwick is now stunned and knocked down in the center of the plaza, while Fiach is in an elevated position and unlimbers his autogun. In addition to acrobatics, he has two other talents. Hipshooting – which lets him walk and fire as one action with no penalties, and rock steady aim – which lets him walk and fire without losing aim, and keep one level of aiming while firing bursts. I think this tells you what is about to happen.\n\nFiach calmly shoulders his rifle, aims at Warwick, and sidesteps across the roof firing burst after burst into the supine puritan. Over the next three turns he empties the gun's entire 30 round magazine into Warwick – every shot that hits power armor doing minimal if any damage, but for two turns in a row, Warwick takes critical headshots and on the third turn, gets head-critted twice, bringing him to \"DEAD DEAD DEAD\" only three turns after the shooting started. On his first game of the campaign, having only gotten to perform a single action. In three campaigns and a number of one-off games, it's the only non-plot based death we ever had playing Inquisitor.\n\nWarwick's player was PISSED at the time, but actually found it kind of funny later, and came back the next week with a junior Inquisitor who was looking for Warwick. His new guy didn't have a helmet... but he *did* have a bionic skull.",

When I left you last, it was to begin the interrogation of Tsuto. We hoped to gather information and prevent the goblin’s attack. I’m sorry to say that we were not overly successful in either goal. While the town of Sandpoint has so far been quiet, we’re no closer to stopping the attack. Our captive was not at all forthcoming. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe did manage to learn the name of the woman in the journal – Nualia. While our prisoner would provide no details, we learned from the priest that she is a celestial being known as an Aasimar. Apparently Nualia’s greatest desire is to become pure demon; she is a truly terrible ambassador for her race. Between conversations with the local clergy and our prisoner, we believe that Nualia is responsible for masterminding the past attacks, and the rumored future assault. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd that attack, Tsuto assured us, is certain to happen. We have no chance of stopping it. If we’re lucky, he says, we may be able to limit the casualties. Despite my attempts at diplomatic reasoning, Adrial’s skilled interrogations, and Barbie’s shouted threats, Tsuto would say no more. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSirus told us that his sword had been vibrating during our initial exploration of the smugglers tunnels, so we decided to continue our search there; who are we to ignore a magical vibrating sword?! Rye’s bird – a most useful companion – was sent to circle the town and send warning if anything should happen while we were away. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter retracing our path, we came again to a branch in the tunnel. Within, we could hear faint rustling. Adrial bravely poked his head around the corner and spotted a sinspawn squatting in the corner. Never in my explorations of Varisia have I encountered such unnatural horrors! Long limbs, slithering, a hairless body, and the most gruesome face – where there should be a chin, instead tiny hands flail on either side of a rolling tongue. The sight of these creatures will haunt me for the rest of my life. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile Rye and Sirus fired hexes from the doorway, Barbie charged past Adrial and decapitated the beast with one swing of her axe. We explored the room briefly, but everyone seemed anxious to escape the presence (and smell!) of the dead sinspawn, so we quickly carried on down the tunnel.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next room looked like a sort of cellar. Unlike the original tunnels, these rooms seemed to be part of some ancient chamber. Finding nothing of immediate interest in the rubble, we moved on and soon found a circular room with a huge, ornate statue. Made entirely of exotic red marble and gripping a ranseur, the depicted woman of terrifying, demonic beauty. We spent many minutes studying her, but none of our combined knowledge gave a clue to her identity. Nor could we make sense of the runes and symbols around the base of the statue. I made a rough sketch, hoping that someone in town would know who she was or why she’s been memorialized in such exquisite form. Before we left, Barbie gently removed the ranseur from her marble grasp. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe entered the next room on a raised platform, and found ourselves looking down on what appeared to be a jailors room – many small cells lined the walls, their rough metal gates sagging with age and neglect. We heard a familiar hissing, and three sinspawn emerged from the shadows. God, but they are horrible creatures! I stepped into the shadows, and kept up a stream of encouraging stories to inspire my comrades, while Rye began unleashing his complex hexes. Sirus unsheathed his sword and ran forth, cleaving one of the beasts and badly wounding it, then spinning to slice through a second terror. Barbie and Adrial followed in his wake and delivered death blows to both. Enlivened by the battle, Adrial lunged forward and eviscerated the last sinspawn with one motion; the beast was dead before he knew what hit him. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next room seemed to be some sort of torture chamber – Adrial perked up considerably at the large array of instruments lying about. There were also a number of in-ground prison cells – deep pits dug roughly into the dirt and clay. From within, we could hear menacing rumbles. Our attention was, however, more immediately focused on the bizarre form approaching us from the far side. A goblin unlike any I’ve seen before or ever hope to see again. Twice the size of the usual goblin, this green beastie had large, manic eyes and three arms. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYes, Jemma, you read that correctly. A third arm was sprouting out from behind his misshapen head. In all three hands he gripped large swords – he was a virtual windmill of snarling destruction.I have no idea what mutation from hell caused this oddity, and I wasn’t inclined to start asking questions; killing the beast seemed a more prudent course of action. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSirus gathered his magical powers to cast a wintry blast of death. Perhaps the bizarre appearance of the beast had rattled his concentration but only a single snowflake shot forth, grazing the goblin’s cheek. As the goblin barred down on Barbie, I attempted to distract it. “Hey, you!” I shouted, “I’m going to write down your name!”. The beast was in such a maddened state, my words made no effect. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdrial and Barbie did not hesitate; both took massive swings at the rushing goblin. Adrial opened a wide gash across its belly, while Barbie’s axe lopped off two of the three arms. It took several minutes for the creature to die, twitching and crying out as blood and intestines soaked the dirt floor.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith the immediate threat neutralized, we carefully peeked into the holes. In each one, we found a zombie in various stages of decay. Sirus, who is always ready to start a fire, threw balls of flame into each of the holes. As the zombies screamed and burned, we looted the room. There was very little of interest for a gnome, but I believe Adrial was able to add several useful tools to his interrogation kit.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere our journey took perhaps the strangest turn yet. Yes, darling sister – even stranger than three-armed goblins or fist-faced demons! At the top of curved staircase, we came face to face with a floating head. Well, flying, to be more precise, with the aid of two wings growing from its neck. Sirus and Rye quickly unleashed a volley of magic. Startled and angry, the head let out an eerie scream. Most of our party got their fingers into their ears in time. But Rye was in the middle of casting and couldn’t move quickly enough. He dropped to the ground, eyes filled with terror, completely paralyzed. Sensing a truly dangerous foe, Adrial cast a shield strong enough to protect us all. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe beast swooped down for an attack, giving both Barbie and Adrial an opportunity to hit at close range. At the last minute, the head changed course and went for Rye. Prone and frozen, he could do nothing to stop the attack. Time seemed to stop as the head rushed forth and collided with Rye. We all watched in horror as it locked Rye in a deep, lingering kiss. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile we stood frozen in shock and terror, Adrial stepped forth and severed its’ wings. The head dropped to the ground, apparently dead. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRye stood up slowly, but proved to be steady on his feet. True he was even paler than usual and admitted to feeling quite weak. But he insisted he was fine so we continued on. At the end of the tunnel, we came upon a large and beautiful room. Fluttering above a raised dias, we found a small blue sprite. Upon closer inspection, this sprite was obviously demonic.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore we could react, the sprite made a quick movement. There was a soft splash, and the familiar scent of sinspawn drifted through the air. Barbie and Adrial charged the dias as Sirus cast a shield spell to protect them. The sprite made a slashing movement, grinned wickedly, and disappeared. Adrial came to a crashing halt, stunned. Barbie’s momentum sent her reeling across the dias and towards the sinspawn.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRye stood perfectly still, using his finely tuned elven senses to try and locate the demon sprite. Sirus was also searching the air. He raised his bow and fired near her last known location, but the shot did not connect. Meanwhile, Barbie and Adrial ignored the missing sprite to focus on the very visible sinspawn. While they exchanged blows with the rabid beast, a noise caught the attention of Sirus. He cast color spray in the direction of the muttering, just as an earth elemental popped into existence next to Rye. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSirus grunted in frustration, and yanked a length of rope from his pack. Looping this into a crude lasso, he ran about the room, attempting to catch the sprite and swinging the rope like some sort of maddened cowboy. Barbie groaned as one of the sinspawn’s long arms connected in a solid blow. Rye was thrown back by the earth elemental, and Adrial screamed in frustration as his sword missed the sinspawn yet again. Things were not looking good for our little band. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOut of nowhere, a huge rat appeared directly in front of me. Startled out of my concentration, I didn’t even have time to unsheathe my hammer before the rat attacked. I gave a small shriek of terror and jumped back – luckily, the beasts sharp teeth missed me by millimeters. As Sirus came to my aid, that damned demon sprite burst back into being. Her presence seemed to focus our determination; the desire to conquer the evil sprite was almost tangible.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBarbie took a mighty swing at the sinspawn. As its body dropped, she leapt through the air and landed gracefully in front of me. Her second swing cleaved the rat in two. Adrial lopped the head off the earth elemental before spinning towards the sprite. With killer concentration, we launched a final, massive attack against the demon sprite. A nimble and powerful foe, it took all our strengths and abilities combined to finally best the tiny demon. In the end, Barbie’s brute strength and Rye’s magical skills brought her down. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe collected our loot and the body of the deformed goblin (purely for research purposes, of course - we would never dream of selling the corpse to Mr. Hosk...) and headed back to town. Our powers were badly depleted after the long battle, and Barbie’s desire for a mug of restorative ale was strong. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd so here I am, sitting once again in the Rusty Dragon Inn and writing to you about my adventures. I am bloodied and tired, it’s true. But we are still alive, still willing to fight. I can hear the others in the tavern boasting of our bravery and bragging about the battles we’ve fought. But under the bravado, each of us is silently screaming for this nightmare to be over; we long for the end of evil, the abatement of violence, and a release from this suffocating darkness. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI can hear Rye vomiting in the next room. I hope the poor fellow recovers quickly – we have a long night of patrolling ahead of us, and little time for rest. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith love,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWB&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n",

        "text": "So here we are, back to the shenanigans that unfold with our unlucky guardsmen.\n\nSo were we last left off Adam had lead the party back to the entrance of the mansion they were exploring. He and the others found a strange pillar of flesh rummaging through their chimera. There was plenty of screaming as Adam shot it. The thing, not bothered by this, brought up a tendril and revealed a silver barrel in it. It then proceeded to shot a bolter round into Adam.\n\nNow for those of you who know what a bolter is, you know what it does to someone. For those of you who don’t know what a bolter does well imagine this. A gun that fires out a tiny, spinning rocket that will dig into a target before exploding. It might not kill a person outright but it’ll hurt. A with guardsmen, a good shot is a death sentence.\n\nThe creature fires and manages to nail Adam in the leg, ripping out a chunk. On reflex Carter throws a smoke grenade and orders for everyone to book it. There was no way in hell that they could fight this thing and live. So, doing what all guardsmen do to survive and run back into the twisting halls of the mansion. They manage to outrun the thing and find themselves in the kitchen.\n\nThe kitchen itself is a sore sight in its state of disarray. The window is partially blocked by the mountain and there’s a door leading to a basement. Seeing that they don’t want to go back the way they came to deal with the pillar creature and going in the basement might be a bad idea for their health the guardsmen decide to make their way out of the window to go and meet up with the rest of the regiment. Adam, being the jumpy tech-priest he is, manages to slip on through the window without a problem with his servitor tailing behind him. After him is Lok. At this point everyone still in the room hears footsteps coming from the door.\n\nOpening the door was a man made from worms. Carter and Ethen freeze up, failing their fear check. The worm man pull out this orb and starts to talk to them. Ethen reacts like any normal guardsmen does and shoots the worm man, specifically the orb he was holding. Less than happy he jumps into action, trying to harm the party. Carter runs for the window and gets through and Ethen manages to get through by the skin of his teeth. After them were a few of their companion characters except for one, Carter’s companion who died in agony. Not wanting to risk going back in to retrieve the body they did the one thing sensible enough for them to do. Unload into the room with explosives and flames.\n\nWith mostly everyone there they returned to the front of the building, meeting up with the squad they had called for medical help. Getting patched up they called for reinforcements because there was no way in hell that they were going to deal with the worm man by themselves. They chose to sit about and wait for the reinforcements, including the planets governor in power armor. \n\nHe asks them where the worm man is and they give him the directions to the kitchen. He tells them, and the rest of the other NPC guardsmen there to go about and clear the upper levels of any threats. So, the party, grumbling to themselves, trudge on up the stair case to start the final sweep of the mansion.\n",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5x0tjw/silent_legions_the_blizzard_part_4/\n***\nOur actors for this mini-campaign:  \n***Charlie Lockwood***, a young teenage girl who is stuck watching her four younger brothers because her parents are high-ranking execs and are rarely around to deal with them.  \n***Annabelle Boudoir***, a somewhat preppy daddy’s girl who had recently moved from Texas, where her father had owned a lucrative oil contract and made some good money.  \n***Raj Mulligan***, born in India and quickly finding himself in the United States of America after birth, Raj is still a ‘fish out of water’ compared to his other friends.  \n***JD Callahan***, the local ‘tough guy bully’ that really only picks on the younger kids he can threaten, but is generally harmless overall. Lives across from Charlie.\n***\nIt is February 8th, 1978. Anna, Charlie, JD, and Raj are sitting at the table in the Lockwood’s dining room. Dice are scattered about the table, miniatures cast about the graph-paper map Raj had drawn for the session tonight. But also sitting on the table are a sword, a shield, and a scroll. The phone rings again. Then it stops. The kids are baffled, having just been squaring off with kobolds and a dire wolf in some underground dungeon. They could’ve sworn it was real. But yet, the sword, scroll, and shield are sitting on the table.\n\nRaj doubles over, a vision piercing from parts beyond, a greater dark power reaching its hungry tendrils into his mind. He sees a knight standing in the construction site, overlooking the strange portal they had discovered. A sickly purple energy seeps free, radiating into the sky. The knight looks back, directly at the boy. He is quickly jarred free and tells his friends what he had just seen. They wonder what it all might mean. JD says that the knight is a threat, taking the sword in his hand and brandishing it with some gusto. Anna takes the shield and hefts the weight onto her back, hoping that there will be some use for it. Charlie takes a peek and opens the scroll. Her stomach drops with terrible cramps as she realizes her *face* is etched across the scroll. Each member around the table examines it to the same effect, a horrific feeling in their gut and their face on the parchment.\n\nAll heads turn when there’s a knock at the door. Wary of whatever might happen next, Charlie peeks outside. It’s a neighborhood boy who has been sledding nearly the entire storm. The broken red sled lies in the street. He claims that something smashed it and asks if he can use the phone to call his parents. Increasingly paranoid, Anna slams the door shut before Charlie can answer. When the Lockwood girl opens the door again, the stairs are empty and some snow filters down from the roof. Then comes the scream.\n\nEveryone but Raj runs outside to see two kobolds holding the boy down, and brandishing a horrific knife. Acting quickly, everyone starts to throw items at them, and shouting for the kobolds to leave them alone. The vile little dog-men are more than eager to satisfy, and toss the kid off the roof at them. Anna trips over herself and the deep snow, but Charlie and JD slam into each-other as they catch the bulk of sled kid’s form. Charlie drags him inside as the kobolds scamper off the roof, Anna and JD hopping the fence to run after them. Raj is still inside, a bit dumbstruck by everything as his friend drops the kid on the couch and runs to the back door.\n\nJD takes a swing at the kobold but misses, and Anna jumps and manages to tackle one to the ground. The thing is knocked unconscious by the heavy shield smacking into it, and the other one escapes. They drag the limp creature inside and tie it up, wondering how to question it since the language barrier crosses whole dimensions. But before they could get into anything in-depth, there was another knock at the door.\n\nThis time Anna opened it, and there before her was the tall gleaming knight just like the one from the vision. Except there was more room for details now. The glistening figure was covered head-to-toe in archaic looking plate armor, even the visor hiding a human face. Strapped across its chest was an M60 machine gun, and a Colt 1911 on its hip. The shoulder pauldron carried a herald marked with eagles and red, white and blue. Underneath were the words ‘GALAHAD’. The knight, in a tough voice masked by the helmet, asked if this was the Lockwood residence. Anna tried to shut the door, but the knight shouldered his way in, scanning the living room and everyone in it. Before anyone could react there was a double-tap into the kobolds head, and he was scanning for new targets. When he muttered about hating to have to kill kids they started to break into action. They dove for cover and any exits as the knight opened fire on the living room. Raj tumbled across the ground and concentrated hard, trying to tap into his gamemaster powers. Charlie grabbed a broom to try and smack/ward away the assailant.\n\nThe kids were briefly saved as the roof started to melt, and globs of thick green slime fell through, slowly dissolving and consuming everything *and* the knight. Raj, Anna, and Charlie grabbed sled kid and started down the road towards the construction site, figuring that the portal was the source of all their woes. JD ran for his own house just across the street, and the knight followed. He barely had enough time to get up the stairs when the enraged government knight kicked down the door, machine gun blasting apart plaster and staircase alike. This shocked and startled JD’s grandmother, who accidentally tugged on the rug, causing the knight to stumble and trip. Hacking and slashing, JD started to engage in a close-range melee battle, tackling the knight and getting the upper hand. The blade started to glow blue and slice the armor open like hot butter, thick crimson blood staining the carpeting.\n\nMeanwhile, the trio reached the construction site and set up to examine the strange portal. The purplish pillar stretched into the sky, causing dark shadows to ebb and flow across the yard. The closer they got, the more gravity seemed to pull them down. Anna was bowled right over, and Raj brought to his knees as Charlie trudged onwards. Realizing her friends were stuck behind her, she headed back to help each to their feet. Hand-in-hand, the three friends trudged to the light beam’s arc. The heat was intense, melting the snow around them and causing sweat to pour from their faces. They discussed who should jump into the portal and try to find help when they heard someone call out behind them. They turned, hoping for it to be JD. It was Jimmy, standing in pants and a t-shirt, eyes gleaming and cheeks wide with a smile.\n\nBack with JD, he crawled backwards up the stairs to evade the pistol shots aimed between his legs. His best attempts to trip and paralyze the knight only made him stumble slightly. Realizing that JD was going to put up too much of a fight, the government man turned his handgun on the grandmother. Anger seething through his veins, JD lashed out and caught the knight with his blade. His grandmother fell from sight, safe for right now. With a roar JD lunged forward, and the tip of the blade fell deeply into the knight’s chest. The man made a small laugh, staring down at the mortal wound before falling backwards down the stairs. JD rushed to sort his grandmother out, then quickly grabbed the guns from the downed knight to go help his friends.\n\nAt the construction site, Jimmy stared deeply into Anna’s eyes. She had babysat him for so long, and could find no reason to deny his offer for a hug. Raj and Charlie yelled for her to get back, but as Jimmy’s arms came around her his teeth flared out, plunging deep into Anna’s sides. The girl fell away, startled and paralyzed as her own blood started to flood into the snow. Charlie still had the broom in-hand, and saw that Raj was apparently transfixed with the portal. Crying out, she swept the wooden handle across to slam into Jimmy, who shattered it in a vice-like grasp. Wood splinters went everywhere and Charlie was thrown back, claws digging into her parka. She felt the cold rush as blood began seeping from the wounds, faster than she could hope to stop it.\n\nJimmy then turned on Raj, body and mind fully corrupted by the possession of Sarkasmos the Vampire Lord. Raj realized that his D&amp;D campaign had created this all. The vampire lord nemesis was crafted by his hands, and as the small child taunted him he turned his gaze to the vibrant lights of the portal. Before Jimmy could strike him down however, the snow was suddenly kicked up in a violent assembly of bullets. JD stood near the fence, trying to brandish the M60 in a threatening manner. Roaring in anger the vampire lord started to stalk by the downed and dying Charlie and Anna, footsteps covered in foreboding shadow.\nRaj called out to his creation however, and all eyes turned to the boy and the portal behind him. A form was emerging, mirthful eyes and fiery complexion bathed in holy light. Raj smiled. If he had created the terror before them by using the rules, he could destroy it by playing against the rules. He had created his GMPC.\n\nSarkasmos roared in anger, threatening the lives of Raj’s family for breaking the bonds of the game. The GMPC stalked forward, the calming presence settling everyone. An outstretched hand brought Charlie and Anna to their feet. Another hand started to weave a spell, an outdated cantrip from a sourcebook long since discontinued. Sarkasmos was fully enraged now, shadows flickering across his face as he jetted towards the GMPC, the form of bat and wolf merging and shifting in the blink of an eye.\n\nFeeling brave and emboldened by the appearance of the GMPC, Charlie took a shattered piece of the broomstick and drove it into the vampire lord as he rocketed by. The pain shocked him for a second, and it was the opening the the GMPC needed. Gliding gracefully across the snow, he reached inside his vibrant and luxurious robes to pull out a small crucifix. Holding it high, he brought it down to brand Sarkasmos right across his head. The vampire lord clawed and scratched, Jimmy’s skin cracking and shattering as the holy energy overtook him. In one last breath he cursed GMPC and Raj for breaking the rules, and burst into an astounding display of atoms. The construction site grew silent as the portal started to fade, and the GMPC flickered.\n\nDoing what he could with the last bursts of divine-like energy, GMPC teleported JD back home to check on his grandmother, raised Charlie’s house from the acid-burnt ashes, and soothed the mind of Anna’s father at her recent bouts of ‘delinquency’. Right before he flashed from existence, he gave Raj a small token of appreciation for creating him. The world flashed and all that was left was a snow-soaked character sheet.\n\nThe gang slowly trudged home. Charlie hugged her brothers and told them that the world was safe now, their home returned to normal. Anna’s father told her how proud he was of her, and invited her inside. JD sat with his grandmother watching some television. Alone in his room, Raj took all of his D&amp;D books and tossed them into the trash. Outside his window the snow started to melt. It was February 8th, 1978. The blizzard was over.\n***\n\n*Epilogue:* Each character was affected by the events of February 6-8 in their owns ways. They faced death, terror, and even worse fates at the hand of a dimension-hopping vampire lord. They did not come out unharmed. Charlie Lockwood fell into a deep identity crisis after the incident, and devoted her life to taking care of children, forever haunted by the near-loss of her brothers at the hands of the turned gnome. Annabelle Boudoir turned to God to fight the terrors that haunted her every dream, and refrained from using the phone and shunned the new invention of the computer when it came out. Raj Mulligan destroyed all of his D&amp;D books and notes, and started to withdraw from society, becoming a reclusive anarchist that railed against the government and the secrets it was hiding. Having seen the cost of life and the voids between worlds, JD gave up on his ways of bullying. His trusty lighter by his side, he set out to try and due right by everyone, to make his grandmother proud. She managed to live another fifteen years and died peacefully in her bed.",

        "text": "[Previously](http://chroniclesofwayland.blogspot.com/2017/03/warning-flags.html)\n\nGM silence continued, and most of us began to believe that he was out of the game altogether. But his last post had said that he would be a bit busier than usual, and he was still paying the roll20 subscription, so we held out and hoped. In the meantime, we had Chris. \n\nOne thing that was clear even from the very first session was that there were a LOT of people. Fifteen people showed up at the first session. There were so many voices that it took forever to do anything in combat. Billy, in particular, would hog the mic, and Nolan was often talking when his character was completely irrelevant. Josh was practically frothing at the end of the first session. He got especially upset when people would interrupt Chris or me (since I was face of the party). He wrote quite a bit in Skype afterwards, using his time in the military as a foundation for his messages. He proposed some things like limiting time for turns in combat, keeping side role-play in chat, and generally shutting up when you weren't relevant. People generally agreed, though the protocols mostly went out the window during the next session. \n\nBilly made a new character, a neutral cleric. Except he didn't want to be a standard cleric, no. He decided to take the option to channel negative energy. And spontaneously cast inflict wound spells. Billy would go out into the middle of a group of enemies and do his channeling thing, and then complain that the GM was specifically targeting him and trying to kill him. After we faced a small group of Earth Elementals, Chris screenshotted one of his roles that he had made in private and showed it to me. It was a natural 20 which would have taken out Billy's second character. Chris wanted to let someone in the party know that was doing his best to let everyone have fun, even though some characters got to low HP. Looking back on it, it might have been best if that character were just killed off by a lucky roll.\n\nNote by Wilk: It was ~15 level 1 PCs against 3 Earth Elementals. My character was hit once and lost most his health from just a normal attack. More than likely this was an issue of the early challenges of balancing so many combatants. We eventually ran from that engagement due to a lack of front line fighters that could keep the elementals from the rest of the party.\n\nMeanwhile, we had players start to drop. One of them was our wizard. Nolan and Josh were talking about the Squire feat. It's basically Leadership, except you just get a cohort that's a lower level than you, with no other followers. Nolan asked Chris if he could take control of the wizard whose player had stopped attending. Chris told him to ask me. Wat. To this day, I have never understood why Chris foisted that decision on to me. I said something halfhearted like \"Sure, I guess.\" The feat was supposed to be for martial characters, but this was an already-established character, and it wasn't like it would be breaking the game, since we already had a party that was three times bigger than a normal one. Little did I know, Nolan had not been asking about taking the wizard as a cohort. Nolan was talking about controlling two separate PCs. At the same time. This unfortunate miscommunication wasn't discovered for several sessions, because large party size. By then, I had discovered my dislike for Nolan. I brought up the issue of a player playing two characters, but Chris said that it was fine. This set a precedent which got way out of hand, but that's a separate story.\n\nNext up: A particular instance with Billy, written by Josh.",

Problem is they have spotlights \nDistraction goes well, only a couple guards left on the back/sides\nThe Valkyrie says screw this and carries paladin flying to the wall, rolls low on the fly check and gets spotted by a spotlight...\nthinking fast (and being at the base of the wall, Zelac burns one of his level 5 spells- Persistent image. I make the image of a massive dragon appear on one of the other sides as a distraction. Gm asks what kind of dragon? European? I say of course not, Chinese!  welllll you havent seen a Chinese dragon, to which I reply- Au Contraire my dear friend, I saw the Jadeling, talked to him, spent hours with him! so a massive jadeling appears near one of the other walls and begins monologuing about how the people are wicked for attempting this horror and blah blah, I throw in a might of the British empire comment to make the paladin happy, he appreciates it. \nLeft, Right and Salad are hoisted up the walls quickly by the Vanarans (the monkey people) so at the top of the wall a couple guards see us and start shooting at us, Left and right put arrows into one, I use hand of the apprentice to smack him with my staff, the paladin charges at the other, doing a crit and putting him into the negatives bleeding, Valkyrie puts the other down THEN STABILIZES BOTH OF THEM... I am pissed (IC, OOC im laughing) but cant show it.  we go to climb down a set of stairs in a corner tower before the Jadeling dissapears, we find two more guards, we put them both down and bleeding then..... stabilize, god dammit, I want more minions... well we get the keys from the one's corpse and enter the staircase\n__________________________________________________________\nlevel 5 is the top of the wall, where we just left\nLevel 4, boring, just empty bedrooms\nlevel 3, contains a lab, and a whollleee bunch of scared scientists! we intimidate them into locking themselves in their offices, we take a map of the facility, and we see something....\nsmall patches of strange white mushrooms, horribly deformed and obviously in very poor shape, no one wants to touch them. I cast acid orb untill the whole table and alll the mushrooms are melted into a pool of goop.  Salad may be a necromancer but isnt up for murdering truly innocent people, he just uses bodies after they are gone (also had a child/wife that were murdered. so the whole murdering innocents to get the blood sits wrong with him)\n\nmoving down level 2 was mostly supply stores, nothing handy here, \n\nlevel 1 we exited out into the courtyard and continued!\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nWe see some Vanarans fighting near the front gate, trying to get it open so we start to head that way and SPLAT! guard falls from the top of the wall in front of us, several do (vanarans throwing them off) Salad is so happy! ITS RAINING PRESENTS! untill he finds out the corpses are too damaged to bring back as undead.... welllll sh*t....\n\nWe help get the gate open, the Valkyrie stabilizes all the dying enemies, and I cant raise the others anyways, too many Vanarans/Paladins in my vicinity... we continue onwards to the greenhouse/Admin building\n\nEntering the greenhouse there is two giant fields of yao grass, half the intellect kind, half the love potion stuff, everyone takes some samples, left and right fill bags of the intellect stuff for me, and keep it to the side to grab later. into the admin building! we use this trick with the portable hole to get under the locked door and we come up next tooooo Two very startled guards! \nThe paladin attackes first, and rolls 2 crits.... so he kills the guy outright! we hit and stab the other one, who eventually surrenders, and sits down in the corner cursing us\n___________________________________________________________\nI convince the paladin and valkyrie to check the next room for more guards, Im going to tend to the one on the ground (they didnt check if they actually killed him) and talk to this guy about why we are doing this.... after some finagling, they leave. \nthe guard swears at me F*ck you you'll regret this blah blah I have left slit his throat, I raise both of them as minions! find fully concealing helmets and return to the others, I say I saved the one and that helped convince the other of how true our cause is, they are bound to help us now (ominous emphasis on bound) Paladin.... ummmmm Im gonna sense motive? rolls a 2, nope! well then brave warriors, glad to have you help us!\n___________________________________________________________\nwe move to the center of the building, open the set of double doors and seeee 4 guards ready and waiting bows drawn, a large size figure, thats wearing a lab coat, he's tall and skinny and weirdly shaped, and next to him a large Tiger-man who turned to us and monologued about how we were fools and blah blah, while this is happening I get my minions to form a defensive ring around me and start preparing a spell.... GO INITIATIVE!\n\nI get first because I was already preparing, for ease of combat the Skeletons go when I go (gm's rules, the skeletons should technically be faster than me, but I dont mind)\n\nI burn wayy more HP than Is entirely safe for the 1st round of a boss fight but hey EMPOWERED MAXIMISED FIREBALLL GOOOOOO (woo for harmful  surge) using my other level 5 spell slot for the day. It wipes out the guards save 1 of them that the minions then take down, the tall dude passes reflex for half and tony fails his reflex but has improved evasion.... still good damage! Tony leaps forward at our paladin, he does little damage, the paladin resists his stunning fist attack, Paladin goes and SMITES EVIL! and does massive damage to poor ol tony, the Valkyrie charges the tall guy who turns out to be a snake guy!!! Valkyrie does some solid damage.  Snake guy goes and casts his down damage spell, flinging it over at me/my minions, minions are in the way so i take no damage! woo!\n\nover the next couple rounds tony does damage to one of my minions, fails to hit/hurt the paladin a bunch, I burn some spells and the snake thing is determined to be a cleric, the valkyrie is doing reasonably well fighting it (and every time it 5 foot steps away my 2 free minions are shooting it full of arrows, wooooo tiny damage) finally! Tony the tiger gets gutted by the paladin, seeing this and panicking the snake guy casts a spell, the Valkyrie has to make a fort save... dc 22.... its close... the roll... after every single bonus is added.... 22 holy crap valk lives- still takes 3d6+12 damage! (slay living) \nthe paladin approaches snake man, I have my minions ready more arrows, and thennnnn bam! snake man casts darkness... we flounder around for a bit, I cast dispel magic so it isnt dark anymore just in time to see him raise a strange object into the air and crush it.... and all the corpses in the room get up- ITS A BATTLE OF THE DEAD DUDES! \n__________________________________________________________\n Paladin and valkyrie are in the back of the room fighting snake dude and two guards, Salad, and minions have Undead Tony the Tiger and 2 other guards to deal with, Luckily I toss a fire ball that knocks out some guards, Tony does damage to one of my minions (Right is in poor shape now) \nPaladin does channel energy.... we math the distance out.... my minions are 35 feet away conveniently! (this was purely lucky, not intentional) Tony the big jerk shouts Salad isnt part of a complete breakfast (not really that may have been in my head) and rolls an acrobatics check, to jump past my 2 guards to tackle Salad out the 2nd story window and into the greenhouse below- I go to 6hp my minions descend to help me (right aces his climb check, others are meh) I roll back, Undead tony the tiger approaches me laughing, I unleash my spell! Command undead! he passes his will save..... shiiiiiiiiiiii...... Right out of nowhere jumps on Tony's back! HE SAVES ME! RIGHT MY HERO! and then gets annihilated by Tony who throws him into the wall of the building. this bought me enough time to cast lightning bolt, which shredded Undead Tony, (and conveniently eliminated evidence of Right's.... \"skin condition\") the Paladin and Valkyrie clean up the remaining guards and loot snake man, destroying the unholy water and unholy symbol- I approach Tony, who says fools! as long as there are idiots willing to enter the Dragon gate this will never be over! and with that I kill him. \n\nI claim enough of the guards gear to properly equip all my 3 minions (who know have +1 weapons! and full plate!) I cant raise the other guards though because you cant raise an undead creature in our setting/game. \n\nwe meet the monkey king who informs us they are rounding up prisoners now, I get my three minions to fill a 3rd bag of grass and retrieve the other two, everyone else takes more samples. we follow the Zhao (monkey king, I think Im spelling it wrong) who takes us back to the lab we destroyed the mushrooms in. we go to the back and find a secret door, through the door, its horrifying, large plots of both kinds of Yao grass, and huge vats of blood, blood of innocent men, women and children, true kind souls.\nwe have a sad moment and we exit the place, the Vanarans took the prisoners, and the Koi folk use their magic to sink the fort and drown the Yao grass. \n___________________________________________________________\nThe mood is sombre back at the jungle city, we receive rewards- of which is loooots of assorted gemstones, I subtly set my minions to sorting out the gemstones- pulling aside the onyx ones mostly as my share, but I mean its just easier to sell sorted ones.\n\nwe sit down and plan, the Monkey king called the remaining Immortals, Its nearing time to move on Bejing, however we (the party) should investigate the dragon gate along the way, beneath an abandoned monastery. \nwe agree, we re-equip, rest some and set off! \n\nIt was at this point that the Gm mentioned the elemental was still locked in his jar and no one remembered to grab him..... whooops. \n\n",

        "text": "The below all happened in game.  The results were many rolls of D10s and some fantastic story telling by the ST and players.  I am streamlining the results into a pure narrative to remove the dice rolls and mechanics.  While I have forgotten some of the exact turns and dice rolls the below is very accurate to what happened and represents one of the most intense roleplaying battles I have been a part of.\n\nPlease read part 1 before you start this! (I didn't get to edit the below but wanted to post it before headed out.)  \n\nWho Shot the Sheriff? (Part 2)\n\nThe main plaza below the city center was eerily quiet.  Pack FUBARs violent scheme left the square painted with the dark reds of gore.  Bits of brain and puddles of blood were splattered liberally across the landscape.  The poor girl who was dominated into threatening to jump lay crumpled in a bloody pool below the parking garage.  If one looked closely they would see a large caliber bullet wound in her stomach had caused her to fall.  \n\nAubrey, the Lasombra who lay perched with a sniper rifle, couldn’t let her leave the part without committing to the finale and taking the final leap.\n\nPriest Vanhelm, who always looked dignified and dressed in holy garb, lay covered in blood with his fangs in the neck of a dead police officer.\n\nThe plan called for mayhem and mayhem indeed took place.  The masquerade had been breached on live television in hopes of luring out the former Camarilla Sheriff Elmer Theese.  The loud signature rumbling pipes of a Harley Davidson a block away indicated the plan had worked perfectly.  What was to come would forever bring this once dysfunctional pack together or they would be slaughtered due to their inability to work together.  \n\nThe pack waited in anticipation.  Remy hid in the shadows and called upon the vampiric power of his bloodline, the Setites.  His skin turned a thick and pale scaly white, his features turning monstrous and snake-like.  His jaw became distended with large fangs.  If one was to stare closely they would swear hints of gator lay behind the reptilian features.  \n\nSack, the demented Malkavian with a burlap sack for a face, reloaded his uzi beside the priest who was feeding incessantly.  Tonight Sack was dressed in jean shorts and a dirty wife beater and spoke with a Cajun accent.  Remy thought it was amusing to have a little gator buddy with him.  \n\nColin the egotistical Ventrue sat his in his posh Mercedes SUV waiting for the right time to drive into action.  (To be honest the pack was worried he might refuse to do anything, it wouldn’t be the first time he refused to help when it mattered most.)  \n\nBugs remained obfuscated in the shadows waiting for the arrival of the Sheriff.  (Much like Colin, Bugs too remained hidden in an instance when the pack needed help.)  Bugs, the disgusting twisted Nosferatu, knew that the stories of the Sheriffs combat prowess were not over-exaggerated.  \n\nAn immaculate polished Harley slowly turned onto the street that entered into the City Center Plaza.  On the bike sat a man of gigantic proportions, who when standing easily towered over others.  Elmer Theese looked very much the part from Sons of Anarchy.  He had long black hair with a thick beard.  He was in dark jeans and a wife beater that was covered by a long black leather duster.  Even under the heavy duster there was no hiding the immense mass and strength that lay beneath.  \n\nHearing the bike rumbling toward the City Center, Colin hit the pedal of his Mercedes.   \n\n(At this point I want to mention that a few of the disciplines were homebrewed in our game.  One being celerity which is the vampire discipline that allows for immense speed.  Normally it allows for multiple actions for every one dot the character has in the discipline.  However, in our game a character with 5 dots was allowed a maximum of three actions.  The extra celerity actions always happened at the end of the round.  Instead of receiving two other actions for a total of 5, it was homebrewed for other effects that allowed a defensive dodge action on one attack in a round and a lower threshold to score a success when attacking with melee.  Needless to say the Sheriff was maxed out with celerity and none of our characters had any.)  \n\nAs the bike rolled in toward Sack and the feeding priest the Sheriff stood up on top of the leather bike seat.  Before anyone could even react the Sheriff was in action. (His initiative was crazy high!)  In one swift motion he flipped off the bike drawing a two barrel sawed-off shotgun as he came down.  The business ends of the barrels ended up on Sack, who crazily grinned back through his burlap sack.  \n\nA great flash erupted from the barrels as a round of pure fire headed toward Sack.  (Aggravated Damage!)  Sack erupted in flames and screams as he crumpled to the ground.  It could have been worst, much worst, as the round hit him in the right shoulder.  Sack groaned and laid crippled on the street.\n\nThe Priest jumped up from the drained cop, his body still controlled by pure instinct as the frenzy still pulsed through him.  Like a rabid animal, unknowing the danger in front of him, he jumped at the Sheriff trying to grapple him.  The Sheriff with a quick swim-move pushed the deranged priest off to the side as the priest could not get him in his grasps.  At this time, Colin had rounded the corner and was heading straight toward the sheriff and priest.\n\nColin had to make a decision.  He wouldn’t have the surprise of using his truck as a moving weapon more than once.  He could run into both the Priest and Sheriff or miss this opportunity.  For Colin the choice was easy, he drove straight toward the two at full speed.  \n\nAs the Mercedes was about to hit the pair, with unbelievable speed the Sheriff dodged out of the way.  The priest was not as lucky as he went tumbling into the windshield and over the top of the moving weapon.  He landed on his back, bloodied but still able to fight.\n\nRemy saw the shit show that was happening before him.  He was in distance to run in, but he decided to hold, hoping that Aubrey could surprise the Sheriff before he attacked.\n\nAubrey came up in spades.  Using her discipline, which allows Lasombra to control the very shadows themselves, large tentacles erupted from the ground.  The monstrous black shadow tentacles exploded toward the Sheriff wrapping themselves around him.  They grappled him and tried to pull his limbs apart.  \n\nBugs realizing the opportunity before him did not remain hidden in the shadows.  He came to the call and jumped at the restrained Sheriff.  His fangs hitting the target as he tore a chunk of flesh from the Sheriffs shoulder.\n\nRemy laughed, “ Booooy, I thought you were supposed to be the big bad Sheriff, I thought this was going to be fun.  A god damn disappointment I say!”.   Remy was pumped up with blood as the veins in his muscled arms pulsated.  The hideous reptilian like vampire opened his jaws and bit down.  The large serpent fangs found their mark; what should have surely crushed any other creature the Sheriff grimaced and muscled the beast off.  He soaked the deadly blow with minimal damage.  \n\nIn an instance, the surprise and advantage the pack had gotten came to a quick end.  He ripped free from the tentacles that wrapped around his arms and brought the shotgun directly to Remy’s face.  \n\n“Shut the fuck up.”  The blast of fire that erupted caught Remy directly into his monstrous face.  His thick heavy scaly skin was meant to soak up knives and fangs, not fire.  The Ductus screamed as he immediately fell in smoke and charred skin.  Remy was out of the fight.  Incapacitated by a single flaming shot.     \n\nThe Sheriff dropped the shotgun as it’s ammo was expended, he growled “Which one of you sick fucks is next?”\n\n(Yes, I was over confident but to be fair I had a ton and ton and ton of dice I was about to roll which cause aggravated damage.  We thought we had him at the moment.  How wrong I was.  We will finish up the third part when I get a chance!)  \n",

        "text": "This is episode 3 of a team of Jedi that would’ve left the entire galaxy better off if they died in Order 66. The last episode followed them as they heroically infiltrated an elite squad of clones and saved a Jedi Master, and then proceeded to shoplift from a department store while one of them sold drugs, and then another member promptly killed one of the drug addicts and beat the crap out of the order. True heroes of the Republic. \n\nFound here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5zyz8c/the_least_qualified_jedi_to_ever_take_on_the_dark/\n\nCharacter Recap \n\nOllanius Pius (me): Human who believes everything is heresy. Very good with leadership and persuasion\n\nCornholio Brown: Human who wants the booty\n\nZarria: Female Zolton with illusion based force, occasionally will say “guys wtf”\n\nUri Zintok: Nautolan who is excellent with a lightsaber and dull everywhere else\n\nVenetor Praedae: Our kel dor pilot who tends to act independent at times. Sold drugs last session to fund armored clothing\n\nAagos: Our mon calamari who kept us alive with medical attention and being the voice of reason. Knows about Venetor’s drug stache.\n\nLil’Ya’ti: A young Jedi in training who raps and we found while escaping the Jedi Temple during order 66, he raps.\n\nSo after Uri had his run-in with the druggies we quickly hopped out of that space truck stop and hightailed it to Nar Shaada, a planet well known for smuggling and crime. We set it down in a space port and Venetor and Aagos paired up and said they had to go take care of something, which we were fine with and didn’t ask any questions. Zarria and Lil’Ya’ti had the pleasure of joining me while I decided I too had business to take care of, and Cornholio and Uri stayed back at the ship. I just announced that I was going to wander around and take in the local culture which Zarria and Lil’Ya’ti decided seemed like a more entertaining idea than staying at the ship which led them to that unfortunate decision. Venetor and Aagos errand consisted of finding someone to buy their crates of narcotics.\n\nMy idea of taking in the local culture on a stroll, unbeknownst to Zarria and Lil’Ya’ti, consisted of purging heresy, and in my eyes this planet was full of it. With an instinct as sharp as an hawk’s eyesight I quickly sighted in on a potential heretic, a lone man sitting glumly in the streets. “Greetings sir, I’m conducting an investigation, could I bother to ask you a few questions?”\n\n“Not in the least bit, I’m jus sittin here wit nutin else to do.” He drawled\n\n“Well it seems that life around here seems bleak and troublesome for most, is that just how life is?”\n\n“Yup just wake on up and get through the day is all we do.”\n\nAnd that confused me, why would this man be so content with all the misery, it was clear something much more sinister was going on. “Pardon me if I’m mistaken, but it seems like this is perfectly fine for you to have all these people live day-to-day in these conditions?”\n\n“Yup I reckon so, not much we can do bout it I guess.”\n\nAnd that confirmed my fear, preaching sedition during trying times, typical and disgusting for one actively working with the dark side to hinder the population.\n\nScene switch to Aagos and Venetor. They had been wandering the streets aimlessly searching for a place to offload their goods. They found a local pharmacy with a sign added under advertising “We buy and sell narcotics!!” They entered and were greeted by a Toydarian manning the counter (The flying alien that owned Anakin in episode 1) The two walked up to the counter and rung the bell, and the oversized bug came over and bartering began. Aagos used the force a few times, to try and make the bug trust them more, or try and push his mind towards accepting the bargain. Venetor had forgotten samples but told him that the booster blue was so good after he sold them to two people it took minutes for them to get jumped and the drugs stolen, which technically wasn’t a lie. The store owner and them finally agreed on a price of a few thousand credits for both crates, set a time and location for the deal, and Venetor and Aagos thanked him for doing business began to head back to the Aluminum Fulcrum. After they left the store the Toydarian picked up a nearby pamphlet that was given to him earlier in the day and dialed the number...\n\nBack to me, Zarria and Lil’Ya’ti were watching in shock as after the man answered my question, I spun around facing the public and loudly denounced the man as a heretic and issued a call to arms, promising to rid the lands of the taint that had taken over the once beautiful lands, starting with this agent of the dark side I had rooted out. I rolled a triumph on my leadership roll and people flocked to the noble cause. The heretic was restrained and readied for a summary execution, but going down definitely with the final words “I’m friends with Kel Daren, he’ll avenge me” and this did shock the mob that I accumulated. However I thanked him for revealing who headed this heretical organization, pulled out my lightsaber and used it to rally more calling it a beacon of hope, and beheaded the man. After that business was done I used force illusion on the corpse to have it burn with black flames and violently convulse (Galaxy Master let it slide due to rule of cool) , and pointed towards it with my lightsaber.\n\n“That is the sign of a true heretic, come now let us find this Kel Daren and topple this awful organization and bring peace for this entire planet!” I rallied, having no clue who this Kel Daren was. The rally was hugely successful, and any fear was quickly replaced with fiery determination. I led them down the street, gathering a larger crowd as we went and gave the go ahead to take matters in their own hands, citing “You good folk all know from personal experiences the areas that have caused wrongdoing, and now I call upon you to take the initiative and end them.” which basically led to mass looting, destruction of property, and the occasional murder. It wasn’t completely bad. We targeted corrupt businesses, drug leaders, and I found out Kel Daren led a pretty sizable drug empire from a local, so any building associated with him was quickly reduced to rubble. Did some other more innocent businesses suffer damages of sort? I’d be lying if I said no, trying to control a mob unified by hatred is a tad hard, so collateral damage does happen time to time, but I’m sure they probably did something a while ago and this is just karma, just a bit harsher version of karma. All this happened while Zarria and Lil’Ya’ti just silently followed mouths agape knowing things were incredibly out of hand.\n\nAagos and Venetor noticed smoke far off in the distance when they got back to the ship and were slightly confused as to what was going on. They waited at the ship by themselves as they were greeted with a note scribbled in crayon “Corn and me go to girl club, back before darktime - Uri” so they had time to kill as the deal was supposed to take place in a few hours just as the sun began to set. As the sun lowered they rented hover trolleys and loaded the crates, then made their way towards the designated area, knowing that the smoke off in the distance had grown to cover a larger area. \n\nDidn't want this to get too long so I'm gonna split, but next up will be the deal itself for the drugs, and following the mob as we bring justice to the land.",

I tell the party I hired a pair of mute mercenary bodyguards.... no one tried to question that. \n\nWe find that the cult here in the city is growing Yao grass- which increases intellect or can be made into a love potion, depending on the variety- we are told by the immortals here in Shanghai that its being harvested and made into garments that will boost the abilities of the enemy soldiers, so we gotta figure things out and stop them! There are 3 districts of interest, the noble district, the Financial district and the docks\n___________________________________________________________\n\nProblem is that the party (everyone was here that day) is split on what to do, also a couple of us were there after working looonnnnggg days overtime so it resulted in some extra sleepy decisions.\n\nhalf the party (Valkyrie, Elemental and Paladin) wants to go charge and knock over the noble district, strike fast, without warning. \n\nthe other half (Salad, The Inquisitor, Left and Right) want to go investigate a little bit.\n\nThe fighting half decided to charge, the noble district, we set out for the financial district. we agreed to meet at sundown at the hut.\n\n\nSo we wander around, 1 Immortal leading each team. Team Investigation goes to the site of the largest bank, that takes up an entire city block, and wander around watching people, learning things etc. I ensure myself, as well as left and right stand *behind* the inquisitor when he detects alignment... to give him a clearer line of sight to important things...  (in our game we say that the detect spells run as a cone in your vision) \n\nso we find out the captain of security often drinks quite heavily in the evening. \n\nwe find his favorite Sake bar and go hang out there, when Its just him at his table we approach and get him trashed, we find out all about all sorts of fun security measures in the bank, and that there is a weird vault in the basement he doesnt know whats in it, but its heavily enchanted (Im thinking either its our mark orrrrrr hey we have more treasure now!)\nwe go back to the hut in the bamboo grove to meet with the other half of the party.....\n_________________________________________________________\nFlash to earlier in the day, other half of the party finds a big mansion owned by the leader of the cult here in town. Contrary to their earlier statement they opt to sneak in, kill the cult leader then fight their way out.\n\nso they \nfind a side door, sneak up the stairs and approach a junction in the hallway with a few door options- STEALTH CHECK! the immortal being a ninja/rogue aces it, the elemental passes, Valkyrie rolls a total of 8... the paladin gets a total of.... -5.... \nthe ninja pops into a side door quickly, leaving them to their fate, thinking quickly the elemental asks \"hey is there a potted plant nearby?\" \"um yeah.. sure\" says the GM Elemental uses his dirt form to layer on more dirt in the pot- an effective hiding spot if you can turn into dirt!\n\nso expecting a couple guards nothing much, the valk and paladin ready for combat- until they quickly become surrounded by guards, with 2 mages in the back casting something.... \"IT'S A TRAP!\" we all shout in our best Admiral Ackbar impersonations. Paladin and Valkyrie are knocked out with high level stun spells to the back. and dragged away. once the guards leave, the elemental slides out the pot and down the stairs (still in dirt form) the cleaner at the bottom of the stairs watching in horror as a huge pile of dirt slowly slides down his neat stairs, grubbying his cleaned carpeting, he charges with his dustbin and broom and tries to sweep it up- (1 nonlethal damage) the dirt continues to move, AOO! another 1 nonlethal! Cleaner's turn! 2 nonlethal! Seeing the epic battle of the ages raging at the bottom of the stairs a guard walks up and pokes the dirt with hit sword\n\nseeing this as dangerous, the dirt elemental promptly grapples then wraps himself around the face of the guard suffocating him, then escaping.\n__________________________________________________________\nWe meet up with The dirt elemental at the hut, find out the other team was caputred! this was bad so we stage a rescue! Our immortal stays with us as we approach the mansion. the elemental uses dirt form again, but guards see him and start chasing him... alarm bells, panic etc. he switches to wind mode and swooshes away, guards chasing him, he looses them but this gives us a chance, we use disguise self/other etc. to look like guards and while the guards are filtering back into the compound we just walk back in. we go down to basement to look for party members, we walk into a room, guards have weapons readied for us, with 2 mages spellcasting, Immortal dispels our disguises, says take them alive and walks out of the room. we get knocked out....\n__________________________________________________________\nso Valkyrie and Paladin woke up in a cell, Im a little fuzzy on the exact details of their escape but basically they used an earth elemental (cause the valkyrie is actually a synthesist summoner) to help break the chains, get out, take out a couple guards, they walk up to the guardhall..... which is full of chaos, monkey people were fighting guards, etc. Monkey people are there to rescue them! they escape into the forest.\n\nthe other team... we get tossed on wagons, blindfolded etc. (inlcuding left and right) the elemental collapsed into a pile of dirt again so the put him in a jar and locked the lid on.\nWe hear fighting, and are eventually hoisted off the cart and blindfolds removed, first me, the inquisitor, the jar is opened but the elemental opts to stay inside (and be carried) they remove the hood/blindfold off of Left, and find he's a skeleton.... its awkward.... the rescuers appear to be Koi People, they are taken aback and kinda step back.... the inquisitor is staring (half because the player was suuuuperr tired by this point, but didnt want to head to bed)  I turn to see what the commotion is... thinking fast I shout LEFT THEY STOLE YOUR FLESH!?!?! THE MONSTERS!!! they pull the hood off of Right- RIGHT YOU TOO! GODS IT HORRIBLE!!! I SWEAR VENGEANCE!!!   \nit was at this point the inquisitor forgot he had detect lies, and the elemental was still inside his jar so he didnt know what happened.\n\n_________________________________________________________\nwe get transported to this jungle city where the monkey people live, they explain the two immortals are traitors, that they are actually using the yao grass to grow spirit mushrooms- if you water yao grass with the blood of innocents and the blood of heroes you get spirit mushrooms, which when eaten regularly grant a kind of cursed immortality.\n\nWe are guided to the fort outside of town where the operation takes place, standing in the bamboo across the clearing we begin to plan and figure out how to take this place down.\n\nPart 3 coming as soon as I write it up!\n",

        "text": "*The following was recorded and enhanced by Segwin Longstride of the Pathfinder Society scribes.  This draft still retains editor’s notes for review by senior scribes before a final clean draft will be submitted to the archives.  The original story as told by Urist McAxelord has been cleaned up and transcribed in to more fitting language for the Society’s logs, as the original text involved far too much belching to be admitted without serious editorial review.*\n\nIt began with a cry of “**DWARF!!!**”\n\nPerhaps I should back up a bit.  The word “Dwarf” is not, as you might guess, just the name of a race.  It is, in fact, a multifaceted word that can have a variety of meanings depending on context, inflection, and chiefly: volume.  In this particular instance, the word was a call to arms, and the dwarf who bellowed the word was pointing to the rear of the schooner we found ourselves on…  but this is still not enough context to understand the situation.\n\nOur party of merry ~~marauders~~ Pathfinders was sent to escort an eleven dignitary to an important meeting.  The whys and hows aren’t important &lt;editor’s note:  see attached pages for full mission briefing&gt;…  well, *someone* thinks they’re important else they wouldn’t have had us come along, but to me, it was just a far too long sea voyage.  They said it’d be a while, they didn’t say we’d be out at sea for damned near two months!  So, after 50 days at sea, we finally made land to resupply for the final 10 day long home-stretch, and after rolling around in the dirt with my fellow dwarves (land!  sweet land!), I immediately ran to the nearest whorehouse to relieve the... frustration of 50 days and nights at sea in cramped quarters with no privacy.  After furiously relieving my tensions for a few hours, I crawled to the local pathfinder guild hall to meet my fellow companions.\n\nI guess now would be a good time to introduce the poor bastards I was shipped off with.  First there’s Lost - there’s more to his name but nobody calls him that, they just call him Lost.  He’s a Tiefling, fancies himself a “Slayer”, I say he just swings a big hammer when he’s not skulking in the shadows.  Then there’s Acelyn, a human wizard.  She’s a bit stuffy, but a decent sort  otherwise.  Finally, there’s the three of us sturdy folk, Kadyan, Mauri, and meself - Urist.  We’re all..  well, undisciplined might be a kind word for it, but to be blunt, we’re barbarians.  Mauri’s a drunken rager, Kadyan’s welded in to his spiked armor and likes to give his foes big hugs &lt;editor’s note:  Kadyan calls himself a “Gutbuster”, and though he carries a maul axe, it appears to be in nearly pristine condition.  The spikes on his armor, conversely, show signs of serious wear&gt;, and I’m just a rough and tumble hard to kill bastard who is perhaps a bit too fond of axes.  &lt;Editor’s note:  Urist had a cold iron great-axe strapped to his back, as well as a half-dozen smaller throwing axes tied off to his armor at various places.  It seems the name “McAxelord” was one given him by his barbarian tribe&gt;.\n\nWe received thanks from the local guild-master, who was aware of our mission, and then I ~~went back to my previous activities~~ had a good night’s sleep, and boarded the Throaty Mermaid &lt;the name of the ship&gt;, again the next morning.  All was quiet for the next seven days.  With just three days left until we were done with the accursed sea-voyage, the party was a bit restless.  I was up at the prow engaging in my favorite pastime: ~~ogling the well endowed masthead~~ keeping an eye out for trouble when the cry of “**DWARF!!!**” rose up on the deck, and Kadyan was pointing at grappling hooks that were attached to the railing on the rear of the ship.  Aquatic Elves were boarding the ship!  &lt;editor’s note:  Urist referred to them as “sea-tree-huggers\" and wouldn’t stop laughing for several minutes&gt;  We made quick work of the boarders, in less than a minute there were five mauled corpses feeding the fish behind us.  &lt;Editor’s note:  Urist went in to great detail about how he and Kadyan voided their bladders on the boarding party as they made their ascent, but I’m saving you from the details.  I’ve heard things I can never unhear.&gt;\n\nOur troubles were just beginning, however.  The first mate summoned us to the captain’s quarters with grim news:  the elf diplomat had been murdered!\n\nThe captain made some accusations about us being the culprits, and we ~~almost came to blows~~ had some words about the issue and he backed down on his accusations, warning us however that he wouldn’t be held responsible for us failing in our duty.  Our duty - pah!  The elf had a bodyguard, where was HE I ask you?  &lt;Editor’s note:  At this point Urist began cursing for several minutes and only calmed down when I brought him another flask of ale.&gt;\n\nWell, anyway, the rest of the party started questioning members of the crew, but I knew they were going about it all wrong.  See, if you’re going to question someone, you need a proper interrogation chamber.  Gotta scare the living daylights out of ‘em, right?  So Kadyan and I went down to the hold, thinking we’d re-arrange the cargo crates and make ourselves a little spot to ~~beat the hell out of~~ question suspects in a properly dwarven fashion.  Instead, we found some human who fancied himself a trader in “rare creatures”, looking over two Rust Monsters in wooden cages.  About the time we’d finished introductions, one of the Rust Monsters &lt;Editor’s note:  Urist began running a hand lovingly along the blade of his great axe at this point in his tale&gt; escaped and set about trying to eat my axe!  It got its feelers on the axe for a moment, too - but we chopped him down in time for his mate to come out and also be killed.  Thankfully, Kadyan’s handy with a smithy’s hammer and promised he’d fix my axe when we got to port.  The monsters’ keeper, upon seeing the bug guts all over the floor, became inconsolable.  I ~~slapped him until my arm was tired~~ consoled the poor fellow who had just lost a fortune, and then we ~~shoved his unconscious body in one of the cages with the corpses of his axe-eating bugs~~  stowed him safely where he could regain his senses.  Kadyan then noted that we had the perfect interrogation chamber in the form of the remaining empty cage.\n\nThe rest of the party, meanwhile, had been making themselves busy talking to the ship’s medic or some such equally useless waste of time.  Kadyan and I checked in on them, watched them find a stow-away, and decided that their method was taking too long.  We went up to the main deck and continued with our plan, brilliant dwarven investigators that we are.  We figured we’d start with the first mate, who was on the main deck. We talked him in to following us down to the hold under the premise of asking him some questions away from the prying eyes of the crew, but when he saw the empty cage he immediately refused to cooperate.  Kadyan and I immediately ~~punched him in the face and tackled his sorry ass in to the cage~~ began our interrogation and soon had him locked in the cage, whereon Kadyan began ~~yelling at him to confess because we knew it was him~~ an enhanced Dwarven interrogation/psychological warfare technique.  The first mate responded by saying “How did you know?” to which I responded “YOU JUST TOLD US!”\n\nAnd so did we ~~beat the story out of the bastard~~ uncover the whole plot, that the first mate conspired with the elf’s own bodyguard to cause the captain to be disgraced so that the first mate could take over the ship.  We presented our findings to the captain, and delivered the captive conspirators to the authorities when we made port a few days later.",

        "text": "Today I bring to you a Story from our recent Vampire: The Masquerade Campaign.\nThe Group came together not too long ago and decided to have a break from our normal Story to introduce a new Player to the table. After some back and forth we decided to use WoD (V:tM) because it's easy to set up and we already have an existing Campaign/ Universe in which we play from time to time. It should be mentioned that our GM is quite the fan of H. P. Lovecraft and Cthulhu in general, which leads to us fighting a more than healthy amount of Cthulhu inspired horrors every now and then.\n\nOne of those horrors is something the GM called the \"Elder Guardian\". We've encountered this thing before and had a hard time fleeing from it as it was essentially an underling of Yog Sapha. This Guardian comes in the form of a gigantic toad with pores on it's back from which hundreds of bat-toad-dog creatures emerge.\n\nThe Group consisted of an Assamite (me), a Tzimisce, a Lasombra and a Gangrel. We were usually working at the frontlines of the Sabbat.\n\nNow our group was assigned with investigating a strange illness that could affect vampires and started to look around in the area of the small town. Without realizing, we strayed away from the \"main quest\" and managed to find a demon worshiper cult doing some nasty stuff in a mansion out in bumfuck-nowhere. Obviously we thought they were responsible for the illness and started to ~~question them~~ burn their mansion to the ground, which lead to us discovering a secret underground hideout. This only reinforced our assumption that they were indeed the one who released the disease so we started scavenging anything that looked even remotely useful to stop the disease and finish the task.\n\nThis is when we stumbled upon a big underground cave/ river system (that actually was described pretty similar to the one we found a while back. Stupid me didn't realize this...). \nNow my Assamite was tired of this shit. he had his John Wick moment before, because he was attacked by hell hounds, and now it was personal. He decided he would reach the end of the cave faster by just walking underwater (imagine the crew of the dutchman in Pirates of the carribean) and suddenly got pulled down by a strong current.\n\nThe rest of the Party used the boats tied down at the shore to see where the cave would lead us and were surprised by the upper half of an Assamite emerging from the water, followed by a gigantic Toad (fuck that gigantic creepy Aura that comes from within the Water right?) chewing on what was left of his legs.\n\nNeedless to say we ran like hell (well the others did, I just clung to the Lasombra and hoped he would make it) while this Monster released an Army of his little Hybrids to follow us.\n\nUp again on the surface we called in reinforcements and resumed getting as much distance as possible between us and certain death.\n\nAfter running for what seemed like an eternity we reached the town and joined several armed APC's to fight the Guardian. The Tzimisce transformed into his battle form (which kind of resembled an Ork from Warcraft, just with more spikes) and started running towards the Guardian.\n\nWe all felt epic in that moment, taking part in this gigantic battle with something we couldn't even think about killing the last time we saw it. Until... yes until the Tzimisce explained, that he would search for the Toads anus and that he, in fact, wants to climb inside. He had seen bullets ricochet off it's skin like rubber balls hitting a concrete wall and was convinced the only solution was to \"fight it from the inside\". He made his acrobatics checks, climbed in and started turning around inside the Toads intestines, shredding up as much as possible with his spikes. This went rather well up to the point where he reached the stomach and got hit by stomach acid. he reevaluated his approach and retreated out of the Guardians ass.\n\nThe group was really surprised to see him again, even thought the acid had definitely had taken it's toll, but before they could ask him why the fuck he did that he rushed past them towards out hideout.\n\nThe next few minutes were filled with heavy gun fire, screaming and a Elder Guardian deleting a town from existence, when suddenly the Tzimisce returned, now holding several blocks of C4 and the appropriate trigger mechanism. Without a word he stormed towards his preferred entry hole and after a minute emerged again empty handed save for the trigger.\n\nthe following scene was described as the biggest bloody mess one could ever imagine as half the Guardian blew up and scattered around the town. We all made our dodge checks to not get hit by pieces of colon and the likes and succeeded, except for the Tzimisce. He told the GM he would walk away not looking at the explosion to appear extra bad ass and obviously never saw it coming. Thanks to his battle form he survived heavily damaged and is now celebrated as a hero. This day the phrase\"huge Ass-plosion\" was born. It now is officially his preferred method of killing.",

        "text": "My first irl DnD campaign has begun with a bang. \n\nA couple of friends have been playing the same campaign for about 6 months and came to the end of their first \"story\" 3 or 4 sessions ago (they're level 5). I'd been wanting to play and so did another of their friends so the DM had a 2 person story without the vets of this world to introduce us to the setting. We had an enjoyable time - Zavug the half-orc ranger got drunk and Chandra the halfling druid helped him slay a giant. We traveled south to where the other 2 players (unbeknownst to us) were staying.\n\nLast Saturday we had sesh 2. We rock up to the local tavern and there's a bard playing some tunes while his wizard friend is sitting next to him. They had just saved a nobleman or something and had 3000gp between them. The bard, feeling generous, [composed a new song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNtTEibFvlQ) and shouted everyone drinks. \n\nThat's when a drunken patron decided he didn't like the way the CN/E wizard was not joining in and got mouthy. The wizard straight up fireballs him. Bar fight breaks out. \n\nHalfling stays and defends himself, Zavug heads upstairs under the cover of fog cloud and a solid shoulder. Wizard decides that is the time to use thunderclap. All the patrons drop to the ground, the guards bust in. They see a halfling holding a drunkard by the foot with a vine and start trying to arrest him, as the bard and wizard retire to their quarters.\n\nHalfling does a misty step as Zavug walks down the stairs. They guards begin asking about the halfing and want to cuff him for interrogation. Not trusting of authority, he runs upstairs and bowls into the closest room - the room that the bard and wizard are staying in. As the guards rush in one gets a magic missile in one eye and a rapier in the other. The other turns away and Zavug grapples him and puts him in a sleeper hold. \n\nGoing downstairs to collect his pack the ranger hears \"that's him, he's the one!\" from the barkeep. Guards shoot him with three arrows and shackle him. \n\nNow in come the wizard and bard.\n\nThe wizard straight up kills 3 guards with lightning and stuns a fourth while the fifth runs to get help, but gets taken out by the druid. The remaining guards then gets burnt to a crisp and swept outside by a indoor tsunami. \n\nThat's when they all make their escape, leaving the half-orc lying in the mud shackled. The guards begin to interrogate him and he says he was kidnapped by the wizard and bard. They don't believe him and say he will be executed if he continues to lie. He sticks to his story and the captain slits his throat.\n\nAnd that is how, on my second ever session, I lost my PC to the guards, whose only crimes are resisting arrest and maaaaybe a little assault, while the killers run free.\n\nI've rolled up a Vengeance oath Paladin now (CN), who has some heavy viking raider influences, and he'll be joining the party at some stage.\n\nI loved this session. It may not be apparent but the session slowly built tempo over time and ended fantastically. There were so many points where everything could have been avoided - free drinks, antagonising drunks, fireballing drunks, resisting arrest, resisting arrest again, killing 12 guards, deciding to leave Zavug behind, lying to the guards. Realistically he could have just said \"I resisted arrest and two crazies attacked the guard\" but he didn't. It was awesome.",

        "text": "I type this Story down minutes after it happened because i know already its one of my greatest.\nAs I write this I am the Face of a Shadowrun Group consisting of 6 people.\n-A female Japanese Rigger\n-A female Decker\n-A female Nocturna Infiltrator\n-A giant Troll with Cyberarms\n-A human –idonotknowyet- who loves to blow stuff up\n-Me, male apparently human face.\nSince the Rigger and the Human Master of Explosive could not make it tonight, the 4 of us decide to look for a job alone. After a while we find one. Rather simple one at that:\nSome random Mobster guy misses some drugs and medical supplies that were stolen by the rival. Our job is to retrieve the supplies and, for a bonus, torch the guys warehouse.\nSo we hit the street and finally find the Rival. I can talk him into showing us his stuff, convincing him that we are potential buyers. Guy leads us into his ware house and shows us the medical stuff. He tells us he has even more and leads us into a smaller room, starting to open a safe.\nI should mention that the guy was a bit drugged up so took a few minutes to open it.\n\nWe quickly make a plan using DNI and get ready to attack when I give the signal.\nTo spare you lots of rolls:\nAfter a few minutes have passed in the Game, multiple people are cowering on the floor, begging not to be killed. Their weapons are useless after the Decker bricked them and their boss is laying on the floor, having eaten a Gel-Round from me directly to the head.\nThe biggest mess however is the 6 dead guys. Our Infiltrator and Troll made short work with them, the infiltrator using her assassin blades (like the hidden blades in Assassins Creed), and the Troll just slamming people into the floor with brute strength and armored Cyber Arms.\nThe only one that is kind of hurt is the troll after he got shot with a machine gun at point blank range and rolled a bit badly. \nOverall we did excellent and I can quickly intimidate the remaining guys to bring the stuff into our truck.\n\nI made a critical mistake however.\n\nI send the Infiltrator out to get the car.\n\nWith her arms still bloody from stabbing people to death.\n\nOf course she is noticed by 2 “SternSchutz” officers. (Think Lone Star but German). In panic she calls me, trying to defuse the situation with a joke.\nI run outside confronting the 2 Officers.\nMy DM does not just let me roll. No he honestly wants to hear how I explain this shit. The loud noises that could have been shots and the bloody women in front of us.\nOut of options I tell them the first reasonable story that comes to my mind:\n“We are currently testing the Special Effects for a Neil the Orc-Barbarian Movie, using this Warehouse as a secret hideout to avoid a potential leak of the material AND to prepare without outside interruption.”\n\nMy Story was a lot more detailed but for the life of me I cannot tell you what else I told them. I basically made up an entire monologue that went on for 10 minutes, just explaining to these guys how my Existence is tied to that movie and that we have to make it work. \nWe play over Roll20 and TeamSpeak, so usually people are quick to banter a bit.\nThis time there was just dead silence.\n\nFinally my DM starts laughing, hands me an Edge point back for the effort  and tells me to roll Edge.\nNot something I am good at like talking. But Edge. He wants to see if I got lucky.\nThrow a single success but still enough to make the Cops doubt themselves.\nThey are not convinced however and want a proof. They want the blood pack we used to fake the “effect”\nThey give me 5 minutes or they call the cops.\n\nOH SHIT\n\nTell them it could be in the car or in the trash. Ask for patience.\nSo I run back to the car and rip open that Med kit I bought. I ask my DM if I find an empty transfusion bag or even more lucky: A blood pack.\nHe says I find the transfusion.\nI hide it under my coat, yell the cops that I will look into the warehouse. Run in and spray everything with the stuff inside the transfusion to empty it. Grab my knife and cut it open.\nThank god the Troll punched holes into people! \nI start rubbing the pack in the bloody goo, running back outside and showing it to the Cops.\n\nThey look at it for a few minutes before they decide:\n“Seems legit”\n\nMade it! Just managed to hide a massacre from 2 cops by showing them a bloody transfusion. I tell them we will clean up soon and I will send a guy to get our stuff.\nThey don’t care anymore and go back into nearby shop. Call my cleaner and pay him extra to torch the freaking warehouse at night.\n\nEverything works as planned. I bring the Mobster the rival as a present; we get the bonus for torching it and found a lot of weapons on top of our reward. \n\nI know this story may fall short compared to the other ones on this sub but I found it funny enough to put it here :)\nThanks for your attention!\n\n",

        "text": "Episode 2 of the bottom of the barrel team of Jedi. Previously we escaped Coruscant by having a young jedi pay a taxi with his mixtape, “borrowed” a ship made of aluminum foil after terrifying an innocent employee into killing his superior, and used very large guns to help in our escape against police. Once everything calmed down we set sail towards Ilum to check out that Jedi Temple.\n\nFound here https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5zr11n/the_least_qualified_jedi_to_ever_take_on_the_dark/\n\nTo recap the characters we have:\n\nOllanius Pius (me): Human who believes everything is heresy\n\nCornholio Brown: Human who wants the booty\n\nZarria: Female Zolton with illusion based force, occasionally will say “guys wtf”\n\nUri Zintok: Nautolan who is excellent with a lightsaber and dull everywhere else\n\nVenetor Praedae: Our kel dor pilot who tends to act independent at times, last session found a stash of 1000 credits and two crates, one with 100 blue booster and one of 100 spice (I mixed it up last post and said deathsticks)\n\nAagos: Our mon calamari who kept us alive with medical attention and being the voice of reason. Very diplomatic\n\nWhen we came upon the temple in Ilum we were received with nothing but silence. Parking the ship and proceeding slowly through the halls we came upon 6 elite special forces troopers deep in the facility, arguing behind a fortified position and crowding around a drill. After a brief discussion where Zarria and Aagos raised their eyebrows in doubt a few times, a plan finally came into fruition. Zarria disguised me as a trooper with charred armor, and I strode in the room with a chip in my shoulder and with an angry shout ordered them to stop bickering. Weapons were quickly aimed at me within a heartbeat, but I managed to convince them I was a superior and part of reinforcements that were sent but my squad was cut down by Jedi that they left behind in their careless clearing of the temple. I was able to negotiate to take 3 of his soldiers out to “hunt the scum” which in reality was leading them to a cargo room and before they knew what was happening they were impaled by lightsabers. After this I came back with more battle damaged armor sprinting back screaming “Ready the guns! They’re coming this way!” and vaulted over the sandbags. They stared anxiously down the corridor waiting for the rest of my party to show up. As they barreled around the corner the last three men desperately began shooting, but their saving grace, the machine gun was silenced as soon as it started to roar to life. The last two troopers were in total shock as a lightsaber came from behind them and was shining out of their squad leaders chest, unfortunately for them the distraction allowed the group to not worry about incoming fire and get up to a full out sprint, so before the soldiers could even avenge their squad leader they were cut down by a flurry of lightsabers.\n\nPatting ourselves on the back we rummaged through the site to see what intel we could find, and discovered their orders were to capture a Jedi Master “Shaak Ti” and deduced she was the one behind the door. Using an intercom system we were able to begin communicating with her and discovered this was a safe room that she locked herself in, and the clones were going to drill in, gas her out, and then take her to god knows where. Once out she thanked us for saving her, and told us she had been in the process of deleting records of Jedi whereabouts and missions underway after the initial purge when the empire figured something was going on and dispatched the squad. Now that she had peace, she was able to resume her activity of masking the Jedi that are currently alive making our survival much more likely. We bid each other good luck and parted ways.\n\nAfter Ilum we had a group huddle of “now what” and Venetor suggested we check out Nar Shadaa, an extremely urban planet well known for crime and smuggling. He acted dodgy when we asked why and gave vague answers such as, “We should check it out, it’s super urban there’s bound to be someone to help us, we can get supplies, etc.” Since no one had any better ideas we just nodded and he set course. During our traveling we saw a space truck stop with a few department stores and someone dropped the idea of changing out of our Jedi robes would help us blend in, so we agreed to set the ship down. Everyone got off except for me because I didn’t trust leaving our ship unguarded with all the potential heretics around and especially with lil’Ya’Ti who totally could’ve been a heretic even though he was 14 and not powerful at all, but ya never know (and I wasn’t there that session). The rest disembarked and made their way to a department store scheming and plotting how to shoplift since to the group's knowledge they had no money on them at all (since Venetor kept the 1000 credits and drugs a secret from everyone). \n\nThe group entered the small clothing store and began looking around and browsing the goods, just acting normal and inconspicuous. Venetor stumbled across a set of armored clothing priced at 1200 credits. He knew shoplifting that would be pretty burdensome and too much work ,so he notified the gang he forgot his lightsaber at the ship, which they dismissed without a second thought. He went aboard and quickly grabbed 10 doses of booster blue from his stash and was able to find two people missing a few teeth and generally just not good to look at, and was able to sell them 10 doses for 200 credits, then he headed back into the store and was met with Aagos being interrogated by a clerk and security guard.\n\nSee while Venetor was selling drugs to uphold the honor of the Jedi Order, The heist of the century had been underway. Aagos had grabbed a set of clothes and just casually started walking out the door. A clerk noticed and yelled out to him, and then security guard peered out from his newspaper to see the commotion. Aagos calmly explained that he most definitely had purchased the clothes, and how stupid it’d be to try and shoplift while holding the stolen goods in plain sight, and then accused the clerk of being bias and accusing him of wrongdoings only because he was wearing a robe and thought he was a Jedi. Luckily for Aagos, the security guard didn’t actually see him try and walk out with the clothes (mainly because he wasn’t paying any attention at all inside the store) so for this fight he was a neutral third party, and on one side was a minimum wage employee fuming over a set of clothes he claims were being stolen, and on the other was a super calm mon calamari forgiving the clerk for being bias against Jedi and saying everyone has different experiences in life and he wasn’t going to judge him for it. Also it should be noted while this was happening everyone else but Venetor just walked out the door arms filled with clothes while the emplyees were distracted, and Venetor was impatiently tapping his foot near the register with armored clothes in his hand. Eventually the guard had enough and dismissed Aagos apologizing for the rude clerk and asked not to rate them poorly on space yelp, and Aagos assured him he wouldn’t hold a grudge and left the store. Venetor paid for his clothing and met the others outside and convinced them he swindled his way out and was there to help sell Aagos’s story that you guys actually were buying stuff, but it was just to lie about the money. Venetor did however tell Aagos the truth in private about the drugs and credit stash after they got to ship. On their walk back to the cherished “Aluminum Fulcrum” is all of its aluminum foil glory two men acting weird called over Uri who was trailing behind.\n\nHe wanders over all jolly like to the jittery and shaking duo behind a dumpster. They ask him if he knew the kel dor chap he was walking with, and were elated when he innocently said “Oh yea that’s Venetor, we’re just a couple of pals.”  They started pressing him if he could get them some more of the booster blue, which confused Uri.\n\n“Isn’t that a drug? Sorry I have no clue what you guys are talking about, we just came by to steal some clothes so no one would know that we’re actually Jedi, if you know what I’m talking about.” He said with a wink. His explanation however didn’t satisfy the two druggies, and they started moving closer and sounded irritated with him.\n\n“Stop playing stupid, just give us another hookup so we can make this high last!” one druggie said coming too close to Uri\n\nAt this moment a lot went through Uri’s head, some strange men were acting really weird, calling his friend a drug dealer, and now calling him stupid while getting mad with him? Now filled with confusion driven anger he grabbed the head of the one closest to him and spun him around and bashed his head into the wall, making a crunch sound as the skull gave way. Uri then threw the corpse into his friend and advanced on the shocked and drugged junkie before pummeling him into unconciousness. He found 8 booster blue vials and decided that they were reason the guys became mean and thus felt obligated to releive them of it and returned to the ship with a hustle. Once in he showed off the booster blue vials he ransacked which Venetor took and promised to get rid of (add back to the stash) and Uri told the crew of the bad guys he met, urging for a hasty getaway.\n\nNext up on “The Least Qualified Jedi to Ever Take on the Dark Side” The crew goes to Nar Shadaa, me and Zarria purge some heretics and start a massive riot while Venetor and Aagos do a major drug deal for the greater good",

        "text": "FLASH FORWARD - *This tale is not chronologically next in the series, and I apologize for that. This session occurred last night and I really want to tell everyone. Its the kind of night I will use to recruit people to play Star Wars for decades. Additionally, Andrew, if you are reading this, dont read the paragraph marked in spoiler text as it is in relation to what my goals are with Sam as a character and you have told me you don't want to know this stuff ahead of time. Members of the Swift Gundark, feel free but know that it will give you a glimpse into exactly how much of these events I have been planning for, and may make you really, really worried about my sanity ooc.*\n\nSamatek, my human smuggler/thief/force exile, makes poor life decisions (*especially* when lightsabers are involved). I've decided that until this man-child begins to meet those willing to teach him more about himself and help him grow, he will continue to make poor life decisions. He is a very depressed individual, and hides it with an incredibly optimistic attitude towards events around him. When things turn sour, he always tries to find a positive thing to say to those around him. It would not be a stretch to say that he is suicidal, and just wants to go out in a way that makes him a legend. \n\nThat nearly happened last night. In fact, were it not for the kindness of our droid who Sam has constantly belittled and picked on, and the pilot Sam constantly argues with, Sam would be dead.\n\nContext - A series of poor decisions (also involving a lightsaber) led to Sam and Vod Fel, our mandalorian bounty hunter/medic, being captured by the empire. We attempted escape too many times and instead of the original plan of the empire to take us to a low security prison... We got sent to a prison on Mustafar.\n\nVod and I were forced to fight one another in an arena, and I tried to wrench open the arena using my force abilities (Sam had awakened during an earlier adventure, where he also lost his eyes and arm. More on that later). People took Sam trying to tear apart the arena as an escape attempt (The entire prison was forced to watch these fights) and rioted. It wasn't actually an escape attempt. I wanted to throw Vod into the lava in an effort to be recruited by a Sith who I knew would be watching. Vod did not, and in-character, still does not, know of that plan.\n\nWith my original plan botched, I hand Vod my knife and tell him to stab me. He was a good fighter, and had been thoroughly kicking my ass the entire fight so I had very little health left. OOC Vod's player says he wants to use his medical knowledge to avoid killing me outright, the GM has him roll a very difficult check, and he gets 1 success. He manages to only do 3 damage. 1 point shy of killing me. I fake death and am taken to the infirmary after the riot is put down. Vod is given a candy bar for winning. \n\nVod finds a note telling him to be ready for a meet on the inside of the wrapper. Shortly after, Vod is given leave to visit Sam in the infirmary. As soon as he arrives, a doctor tells us that we need to be ready to escape soon, and we make our plans...\n\nSam and Vod manage to get their hands on two stormtrooper outfits. Vod, being a mandalorian, fits his perfectly (in reality it was a triumph I rolled on my own failed disguise roll). Sam on the other hand immediately rips the body glove trying to get it over his cybernetic arm, giving me a significant disadvantage on anyone taking any serious look at me. \n\nShortly after the Sirens start blaring and we leave the infirmary, there was a guard stationed in the infirmary but I rolled enough advantage to have him be fast asleep when we tied him down. I gave Vod his blaster rifle and we left the infirmary. It didn't take long for my metallic implant to be noticed. I believe the excuse I used was \"Uh, I was assaulted during the fights, they uh, got my blaster and I tore my bodyglove in the fighting. He was escorting me to the armory for uh... Resupply.\"\n\nThe stormtroopers immediately start trying to radio in two rogue stormtroopers and I cut them off ordering Vod to kill them as I smacked their sarge in the face with my cybernetic arm. That did nothing. The storm troopers take aim, and fire. and in true storm trooper fashion, they miss. Repeatedly. The sargeant, frustrated, pulls out a vibro knife and manages to stab me in the arm. \n\nMy prosthetic arm. He stabbed my secret compartment in my prosthetic arm. As he is lunging and stabbing I remember turning to vod, knife entering and exiting the secret compartment and yelling \"This thing is so damn useful!\"\n\nI manage to rip the sergeant's pauldron off (We had decided the body suit tears were on the shoulder primarily, although I'm sure the vibroknife made it a little bit worse on the forearm) and throw it on as Vod lands another hit on the sergeant, who is now running.\n\nWe turn and see prisoners flooding from the elevator, mutating. Unbeknownst to us, the break-out party, A droid in our break-in party was secretly programmed to release an experimental toxin on mustafar by roughly the star wars equivalent of a very friendly and jovial Hitler who had taken special interest in our group. The prisoners quickly reform into mindless hybrids, killing the stormtroopers as Vod and I sneak past them and into the now empty turbolift.\n\nWe press the hangar button, and stop to pick up stormtroopers on every level (Think trying to go down the elevator in a crowded mall.). Not a single one is remotely interested in looking at us so no checks were made. Just a very uncomfortable elevator ride with the enemy.\n\nWe finally reach the hangar and see our old friends, the Bothan Pilot Yinak, and our droid companion IZ21 (pronounced Izzi, and yes this is the droid that got reprogrammed by space Hitler) Valiantly fighting off both stormtroopers and hybrids. \n\nBut Sam's focus is on the sudden silence in the force, as a specialized TIE interceptor lands in the hanger, and Lord Vader emerges. As Vader is doing his imperial march strut to the middle of the fighting, the currently adequately disguised Sam decides that this is the opportunity he had been training for (He spent months in his cell moving bits of scrap with the force). He had gotten just strong enough in the force to move objects. \n\nAnd he elbows Vod and says, \"I've gotta do it.\" Out of character, the entire table yells no. (We spend roughly ten minutes debating whether I should, or even if Sam would, and only Vod's player says \"play your character\" but thats what I needed to hear) Our GM says \"if you want to try it, it'll be a roll off against Vader's Discipline.\" I weigh the many, many cons of trying to snatch his lightsaber... And the one pro, and I realize, live or die, this is who Samatek is at his heart. A greedy, arrogant kid who really ought to know better. \n\nSo I roll. One Success (Everyone loses their shit. I get yelled at over facebook by my gf for screaming at my monitor and beating up my desk), a very thematically fitting dark side pip, and a shitload of threat that was immediately all spent on making Vader immediately notice and see me put it inside of my prosthetic arm.\n\nDarth Vader, without skipping a beat, is infuriated and lifts me up and begins choking me. We attempt to distract him by spending a triumph on the hybrids coughing sand into the air, but his filters resist the meme damage. Vader rolled Resiliance, and got two triumphs, which he immediately used to rip off my entire prosthetic arm and get his lightsaber back. I got a chance to roll myself to resist it but it didn't matter. The rebels fighting in the hangar are ordered by Izzi to get me out of there, and after an immense struggle they manage to break me free of Vader's grasp and stick me in the shuttle.\n\nYinak, our bothan pilot manages to keep the ship together as the hangar plummets toward the lava. (The prison had a failsafe to drop the entire facility into lava should it fall into enemy hands). Vader boards his vessel and takes off, and we find ourselves trying to outmaneuver the best pilot in the galaxy.\n\nYinak manages to keep us flying long enough to get coordinates punched in, but the math isn't checking out. We decide to risk hyperspace death over fighting the dark lord (and spend all of our destiny points we had at once.) and make a blind jump into hyperspace.\n\nI was actually awarded best Roleplayer for nearly getting myself killed. and there are several actions taken that I have left out, so for the sake of ensuring I give credit where its due, Izzi distracted Vader enough to get me out of his grasp, Vod reassembled Yinak's guts as I was pulled into the ship, Yinak and Izzi actually infiltrated the wrong outpost the first time (supposedly intentionally). Our GM had more plans for the prison but we Karked that up.\n\nBut in summary, I personally offended Lord Vader. And I have been informed out of character that he does in fact now have a vendetta against me. Buuuut...\n\n[Sam Character Spoilers NOT FOR ANDREW](/s \"The week I created Samatek I had a dream of him and Vader dueling, both with red sabers. It was still going when I woke up, and ever since then, I have wanted to see the end of that fight. This event has been a plan of mine to gauge how my GM statted Vader and how best to build Sam to take him on. Luckily, I now have that data. We'll see if Sam lives long enough to fulfill his destiny.\")",

        "text": "&gt; \"I've killed Thunderjaws, but I ran into this giant bird thing that messed me up pretty bad. No, not a Glinthawk, something bigger. Some kind of lightning bird. I had to run from that one.\"\n\nChallenge accepted. I had spotted this thing near the Endurance trials and tried to fight it, but after a while it flew up higher than my arrows could reach. I had assumed it was a unique enemy and therefore scripted to flee until I had reached the appropriate point in the story. The above comments from my coworker inspired me to try again, and the next day I found myself back at the trial site.\n\nNow, it's important to note just how unprepared I was for this battle. I had just finished mastering the Endurance trials, which largely consist of being trampled by giant mechanical bison while a flock of robo-birds piss liquid nitrogen all over you. My medicine pouch was almost empty, I was down to my last few healing potions, and my armor, which had an impressive stealth bonus, wasn't really useful once the enemies could see me. In short, this was not a good time.\n\nBut there was the bird. Scanning it revealed a large number of destructible components. Decades of gaming experience have taught me that you shoot the boss in the glowy bits, so I nocked a tearblast arrow. These things do no damage, but they stick where they land and release a concussive blast that rips off nearby armor and components. I aimed one at the biggest glowy bit I could see, and fired.\n\nThe arrows sent boss bits flying everywhere, which seemed to piss off Cybird pretty badly. It started launching shock projectiles at me, but the lightning cannon on its chest was one of the first parts to go. The parts on its wings were a lot harder to hit, but I removed most of them fairly quickly. The bird hovered, as if considering its actions. Most of its ranged capabilities were now gone. It moved closer, and the world disappeared.\n\nWe had wandered away from the cliffs where the trials were held, into a large rocky plain. A sandstorm had moved in at the same time the bird approached. The universe had narrowed down to just me, my prey, and the roaring dust. The great bird hovered a short distance upwind. I switched to fire arrows, which have a shorter range but fire faster and apply the burning status for damage over time. The Glinthawks, smaller bird robots, tended to fall to the ground after one or two of these hit them. I thought maybe the Stormbird would do the same. It didn't, but my fire-bonused bow was racking up damage at a decent rate. It attacked more frequently now and I dodged frantically, taking a few hits when it passed directly overhead where the camera couldn't track it. No more healing. I tried tying it down with my ropecaster, but the version I had was designed for smaller machines. I couldn't get enough ropes in before the first ones started to break. I tried more tearblast arrows to remove the few remaining vulnerable parts, but it was difficult to aim precisely enough. More fire arrows kept up the burning. Eventually, the bird landed. I switched weapons.\n\nMost of the gear I had was designed to inflict various status effects. I could do decent damage with the fire arrows, but nothing spectacular. The one exception to this was the Blast Sling, a type of slingshot that lobbed exploding orbs. Its stats are focused on raw damage, which I more than doubled by adding damage mods, but the range was very short and the projectiles' parabolic trajectory made it impossible to use against flyers. But Mecha-Zapdos was now on the ground, trying to use melee attacks. I rained hell on it. \n\nBlast after blast hammered the top of the beast's wings and body, forcing it into the ground and shattering its armor. The barrage stopped only when I ran out of ammo. The bird was nearly dead. It squawked in rage, and charged. I did the same. It lunged, I leapt. My spear connected, and the machine collapsed. The wind calmed. The dust dissipated. I took a moment to breathe, and then a pack of robot emus jumped me. Many birds died that day.",

        "text": "This is going to be a multi part story following the escapades of the least professional Jedi as they bumble their way through the galaxy and cause headaches for our Galaxy Master. The main characters are:\n\nOllanius Pius (me): A basic human who is basically a stereotypical crazed inquisitor from Warhammer 40k, everything is heresy (tainted by the dark side) and if it isn’t then it is well hidden and disguised heresy. Was weak in combat but strong at influencing others.\n\nCornholio Brown: Another human who is very booty driven, not the treasure chest of gold kind…\n\nZarria: A female zeltron (and our groups only girl character) who was more on the side of things and occasional voice of reason.\n\nUri Zintok: A nautolan master swordsman, could probably beat Mace Windu in a 1v1, put all points in the trait associated with lightsaber (brawn) and only leveled up lightsaber skill and force powers that could help him in melee. However because of this anything not associated with swinging a lightsaber tended to go poorly.(general thinking skills)\n\nVenator Praedae: A kel dor who was a bit more independent from the group, he piloted the ship (usually after things went horribly wrong and it was in everyone’s best interest we left) and a general all around character.\n\nAagos: A mon calamari who was the main voice of reason amongst the bombastic and loud decision making that usually occurred. Very powerful with the force and was our much needed and used medic.\n\nThe tale begins with everyone as younglings, training with their Jedi masters, where introductions are made as the group underwent the Jedi Initiate Trials together and got to know one another briefly before everyone passed and went their own ways soon after to continue training. Years passed until we all found each other again at the bloody Battle of Geonosis in the arena. It started off with us all cutting down droids like grass until the tides quickly shifted and it turned into a Jedi bloodbath. We shuffled towards the center as the focus became survival rather than slaughter and hoped to live long enough for evacuation. We all took heavy damage but made it aboard a gunship. While flying away from the carnage we had moment of “Don’t I know you from somewhere?” So we all briefly catch up before splitting ways and doing Jedi things for a while.\n\nScene change, we are all off doing independent things when each of us receives a hail to report to the Jedi Temple because plot. We meet up and talked among ourselves wandering the area wondering what was going, when off in the distance we see a few comrade Jedi. We wave at them and usher them over to figure out what the situation was when suddenly they get absolutely lit up with blaster fire. That tends to be unusual in Jedi temples, so we quickly duck down and peer out to see some clones walk out and double then triple tap the corpses. After a force mind prod of one of the troopers we find out the clones were ordered to exterminate the Jedi (order 66) so now our goal is to get off this rock and wing it from there. \nAfter taking some back ways and avoiding extermination patrols we run into a younger Jedi in training who was hiding after being assigned janitorial duties and witnessing executions. He told us he knows of back passages that the clones probably won’t check as they were just purging the more commonly occupied areas at the moment, which should let us slip out easily. I took this moment to try and pry his mind for heresy but I ended up botching the roll so in my character's mind he was probably a much more powerful force user than he put off and blocked me from entering his mind and was more than likely a heretic, so that led to permanent distrust from me. We escaped the temple and took a taxi to a nearby spaceport to jack a ride for the greater good. Along the way our new friend regales us of his side job where he is a beginning rapper and his name is lil’Ya’ti, and paid the taxi with a copy of his mixtape. \n\nWe snuck into the spaceport and found a small freighter ship called “The Aluminum Fulcrum” which was the Millenium Falcon but the outside was constructed of aluminum foil. The ship was  unlocked and the keys were in the overhead visor, however due to the Jedi temple going up in flames the spaceport was on lockdown. Thankfully my inquisitorial skills works wonders at convincing the common man to aid us, so after a brief talk with a spaceport employee where I stated it would be both of our best interests to make sure our ship was freed, the employee promptly began sprinting to the control station, and our ship’s docking mechanism became unlocked. Unfortunately the employee went a bit mad and shot the person manning the controls because the force may have been used to give him an overwhelming sense of fear (it was a very important roll and it's okay if I use the dark side since I police it, so obviously I can never be corrupted by it, right?). \n\nDue to there being a very public and loud murder, panic started in the spaceport, and police were called which made our escape that much more complicated. We were quickly met outside by two space police cruisers and a third stalled out near the entrance. The third cruiser was being driven by a new rookie caught on his first patrol and the mentor just silently watched and judged while the rookie panic fumbled with the controls. Aagos and Zarria were in the turrets blasting away at the two cruisers tailing us and downed one of them before the rookie finally got his car started, earning a nod of approval from his instructor. The second cruiser started going down in a ball of flames before the rookie finally caught up. His glory was quickly cut short as a round pierced the windshield that killed his instructor and disabled the engine, leaving him to mourn as our ship flew up and out of side, leaving only a slight tail of debris in wake. A major part of this debris, was my unofficial homemade “Member of the Jedi Order” personal ID card, which drifted down and landed lazily on the disabled cruisers hood, where inside a rookie mourned over his fallen comrade, lusting for vengeance. When we finally had a sense of security and jumped out of system, we settled into our new home and began planning. We decided to go to Ilum and check out that Jedi Temple and see if there were any survivors, and hoped to beat the clones there knowing that they were going to head there if they haven’t already. While we were all planning and scheming, Venator took this time to scour the ship, knowing that these were used for smuggling he looked for hidden compartments, and stumbled upon a stash of 1000 credits and a crate of death sticks (drugs) which he decided to keep that secret to himself.\n\nFirst post so any formatting advice or criticisms are welcome!\n\nPart 2 here! https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5zyz8c/the_least_qualified_jedi_to_ever_take_on_the_dark/",

        "text": "\nSo, I play Space Station thirteen with a friend. He was still introducing the game to me seeing as I was pretty new, and I had only played the game once or twice with him and SS13 is complex af. \n\nHe suggests I take a simple role, one which won’t get me yelled at for fucking everything up. I take a look through the possible roles and come to a job called Bartender. “Seems like fun” I say to myself. My friend confirms that this is a pretty easy job. \n\nThe round starts. I notice a few things which surprise me. First of which is a shotgun, which comes with several shells. Apparently I’m supposed to use this in case of self defense. \n\nThen I notice a Monkey. His name is Pun Pun. At first I laugh in confusion and derision, “Why would I need a monkey?”. However soon I would find myself growing quite fond of the little guy, especially considering how most of the time he was my only company. No one seemed to come to the bar. \n\nTo my left was the kitchen, from which I would occasionally see and hear the chef cooking… something. I would see a lot of blood around there and at first I decided not to question it. After all, space burger meat has to come from somewhere. \n\nMy friend is playing a medic, so him and I have little contact either. We agreed to make sure not to metagame even if we had voice chat, so if one of us died to an antagonist we weren’t allowed to tell each other. Still, I did hear something of what was going on in the rest of the station from him. \n\nAs a bartender with no customers, I decide to just mix some random drinks and put them on the bar. I didn’t really have a rhyme or reason to the mixes, just randomly throwing ingredients together. \n\nThen I thought it would be hilarious to get drunk on the job, seeing as no one really gave a damn about me or what I did. Space station 13 simulates drunkenness pretty well, and I remember vomiting and falling unconscious a whole bunch of times, not to mention typing random crap to screw with the drunk text converter the game had. A lot of it was directed at Pun Pun, which was amusing to me. In my mind, my character had a bond with the animal. \n\nI ended up getting so plastered, I didn’t notice that my monkey had gone missing…\n\nI’m not sure whether he wandered off or I just didn’t notice this because I was drunk, but the Monkey was now in the kitchen. Remember how I said that space burgers had to get meat somehow?\n\nTurns out the Chef had saw fit to make my monkey into the space patty. \n\nI managed to catch a glimpse of the bastard using his cleaver to cut up my monkey. I frowned IRL. \n\nThat was Pun Pun. My friend. My companion. My responsibility. I could not let this go. \n\nI loaded my shotgun, and walked through the door to confront him. The chef came out of the back room, drenched in blood, come to face me. \n\n“What did you do to my monkey?” I asked. “What did you do to PUN PUN!” \n\nThe chef did not answer. Not verbally at least. Instead he threw what looked to be a chunk of meat at me. It hurt, but when I moused over the chunk it hurt my soul even more. \n\nMonkey Meat. \n\n“You BASTARD!” I shouted. \n\nHe moved towards me. \n\nI fired the shotgun. I somehow managed to miss. He then slashed at me with his cleaver, cutting into me. I didn’t care. \n\nI fired again, blasting him to the ground. He groaned, hitting the ground in a pool of his own blood as I reloaded. He had got back up by the time I got the other bullets in the gun. I fired again, downing him, and managed to miss a second time by clicking randomly. \n\nHe was about to get up again, and at this point I was acting on pure impulse. I stood next to him and clicked. I thought this would shoot him, but instead I slammed my shotgun into him. I did this again. And again. And again. \n\nThe Station Security had to come in and pull me off him. They had no idea what had just happened. The Chef was still alive, and managed to murmur something through a broken face. Either I forgot what he said through the passage of time or at the moment my anger at him for being alive was too strong to listen to him. Either way, we were both dragged off. Him to the hospital, and me to the brig. \n\nI told the security officer that the man had killed Pun Pun and attacked me. He didn’t seem to care. It probably didn’t help that I was still a little drunk and slurring my typed words considerably. \n\nI was healed, then shaved, then forced into prison clothes. The guard escorted me to a cell. He threw me in there to rot. \n\nI wouldn’t stay there for long. \n\nThe station was hit by massive explosions, especially in the brig. I don’t remember what caused them, but I do remember the guard coming towards me as my cell was opened. \n\nI saw the station wall was open, and simply walked towards the cold vacuum of space. \n\n“What are you doing?!” The Guard asked. “I’m taking you to the shuttle! We need to get out of here!” \n\nI turned to him. “Leave me.” I spoke. “I have nothing left in this station. My life is complete.” \n\nThe guard seemed to understand, or at least acknowledged that saving me was more trouble than it was worth and let me go. \n\nI walked out into the vacuum, and embraced death.\n\n“I’m coming Pun Pun.” \n\n————————————————————————————————---------------------\n\nI remember asking my friend after that why I wasn’t banned for beating the shit out of that chef and nearly killing him (As we had been banned for a day after both being clowns and a mime and beating another clown near to death with a crowbar, which is another story) after all it wasn’t a confirmed antag so wasn’t it rdm? My friend paused to think, then replied. “I think it was cause you had a reason. It wasn’t random.” \n\nHe was right. I thought. It wasn’t random. \n\nIt was justice. \n\nTL:DR: \n- Is a bartender with a monkey\n- Gets Drunk\n- Monkey is killed\n- Nearly kills chef, shooting him and beating him to death with shotgun. \n- Gets arrested\n- Dramatic dramaticness.

        "text": "It was late.. or very early depending on your particular view, when Mus'ad tread very lightly through the old keep. With only the wan light of one of his dwindling supply of candles, he approached the room where Solomon's body lay, and hesitated at the doorway. The dim light barely made out the tall form lying still on the old bed, but Mus'ad imagined his friend was only sleeping. He had strong beliefs about the afterlife and the truth that Sarenrae represented, but here, in this darkened room accompanied only by his own breathing, he faced the heartbreaking reality of the mortal form. Mus'ad could only wonder if his friend was enjoying the fruits of serving his god, Torag, or if he had been misled in his faith. \n\nSoloman was an outsider in his faith. One of the few humans to serve a dwarven god, plus Mus'ad has heard about Torag's distance from his followers, so he couldn't help but wonder. No matter, for this morning, he hoped Sarenrae would shine forth in her glory - her benevolence knew no boundaries. Maybe he was overstepping his boundaries, but he must try. For all his faults and the fact of his unfortunate faith, Soloman was a good friend to Mus'ad and a good person that had done much good. Standing side by side with him dealing with the evils in this world.\n\nMus'ad carefully and respectfully lifted his friend's body from where he lay and carried him out, across town to the place where the temple to Sarenrae was in its very earliest stages of construction. He lay Soloman on his back, head facing east and rolled out his prayer rug. He lit three candles and placed them out - one at the head, one at the feet and one on Soloman's chest. Then began some morning prayers awaiting the sunrise.\n\nWithin minutes, the sun began the show above the horizon and Mus'ad began his ritual in his native Khelish.\n\n\" 'Iilhatan eazima Sarenrae, Zahrat Alfajr, taluq fi kl ma tabdhulunah min mmajd! \"\n\nGreat goddess Sarenrae, Dawnflower, shine forth in all your glory!\n\n\" 'ana eabdak dayimaan \"\n\nI am your servant always.\n\n\" hadhih alhayat taht daw' airtifae darajat alhararat ladayh tamm 'iitfawuh min khilal wahid yakarrih \"\n\nThis life under your warming light has been snuffed out by the Hated One.\n\n\" 'atlub alkhayr bik, niemat alkhass bik \"\n\nI seek your benevolence, your boon\n\n\" aistieadat lah rruhih \"\n\nRestore to him, his spirit\n\n\" wafi almuqabil, 'ana, Mus'ad al Quatar, yjb dafe ay thaman tatalabun! \"\n\nAnd in return, I, Mus'ad al Quatar shall pay whatever price you demand!\n\n... \n\nBy the time he finished his last words in the sharp air, the sun was above the horizon in full. With his arms outstretched taking in the full measure of the sun's rays, Mus'ad wondered if Sarenrae thought his hubris too much, or if the goddess would reward him for his (he thought) faithful service.... Either way, soon, he will have learned valuable lessons.\n\n_________________________ \n\nThe entrance to a temple of Sarenrae is a sacred site. Tall, wide, and inviting it always faces East; greeting the Dawnflower in her brilliance and eagerly awaiting her warmth. No vestibule, no inner gate, and no curtain wall shall impede the morning light on it's path to the temple's heart. The doors, once placed, will be of glass and gold and reflect Sarenrae's beauty. Each morning, the sun will rise to find them open as outstretched arms. As the doors are placed last, so shall the threshold be erected first; as invitation for the healing light to sanctify and cleanse the site before the walls ever meet. \n\nSo stood the doorway in Belhaim.\n\nSarenrae's radiance washed in through the open portal, across the beaten dirt, and over her praying servant. His penitent form bowed at the feet of another warrior for the faith. This one was not hers. He belonged to another. One who shunned her morning kiss and was far slower to forgive. Indeed he had not yet even seen to the frail needs of his devoted that lay cold and still on her floor. ​ The mortal instead had found its way here, in the warm arms of her faithful. \n\nShe was familiar with this one. A little candle in the darkness; wading constantly deeper despite a constant struggle to determine the purpose of it's own flame. \n\nTo warm, to illuminate...or to burn. Perhaps all three?\n\nNow he beseeched her. Pleaded that she return the spirit of another's belonging. Implore that she relight a flame that was dowsed and deeply buried. So, so far down into the darkness. She could of course. Did his faith not deserve her recognition? A touch like she had graced before? Despite the flickering wind and ever-present gloom his flame glowed brightly. Strong enough to withstand the suffocating pull from the other side. \n\nAnd thus spoke Sarenrae...\n\n\"Your prayer is heard little flame. This one is a fuel not fully consumed. But beware that a tinder may only be relit so many times before becoming a blackened husk. The price will be scorching...\n\n...and it will not be my soul that burns.\"\n\n_________________________ \n\nMus'ad gasped as the Dawnflower's radiance filled his body, burning, yet soothing. The warmth of her presence filled him, but...this time her presence was much more than at any time in the past and for the first time, he heard her words more clearly than ever before.\n\n\"The price will be scorching...\" \n\nThe flames of creation filled his mortal form and for a moment he felt the souls of the world around and inside - Mus'ad steeled himself for he knew the price would be steep and gave himself freely - every fiber of his being burned! And one final word escaped his mouth before he lost consciousness: \"Soloman!\"",

        "text": "This is a story from our most recent World of Darkness campaign. Our ST has been running his world for well over 15 years in various games and states. I have been gaming with this fantastic group just about a year at this point.  It’s quite the amazing world with rich characters, political power plays and blood baths.  This is going to be long and writing is not my forte!  (Disclaimer: The group does homebrew a few of the rules and discipline powers.)  \n\nThis story takes place from our latest Sabbat game set in Westchester, New York. \n\nSo without further ado, lets meet Pack FUBAR (How we got this name is a story for another time-let’s say the first two games with this pack were disastrous)\n\nDuctus: Remy of Clan Setite (my character): Born in the bayous of Louisiana, Remy was a bear of a man.  He considered himself an entertainer, a performer- who just happened to wrestle gators before being turned.  While boisterous with a smile as large as his hands, there was an anger and rage that boiled just beneath.    \n\nAubrey of Clan Lasombra: Her name was whispered with both fear and reverence in the dark corners of the criminal world.  Those loyal to her she treated as family, those who disrespected her she collected their body parts.  When turned she lost the empire she had built, but in return her sadistic, cold and calculating nature only sharpened. \n\nBugs of Clan Nosferatu:  (For those that read my previous stories, this is of course Zoe).  Bugs had his name for a reason.  Large parasitic insects, botflys being the preferred residents, called his body home.  As with most Nosferatu, secrets and knowledge was his currency.  \n\nColin of Clan Ventrue:  True to his clan Colin stunk of stubbornness, hedge fund money, and the desire for power.  A full on tool that seeded distrust and dysfunction between the pack.  Beautifully played and based on Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.  After one game session the Lasombra and Nosferatu were planning this characters demise. \n\nSack of Clan Malkavian:  Riddled with multiple personalities, Sack would take on the characteristics of those he met.  One day he would be a bootleg swilling swamp boy and the next a narcissistic hedge fund manager.  His face was covered with a taught burlap sack, which if you mentioned he would have no idea what you were talking about.\n \nWho Shot the Sheriff?  Part 1\n\nThe Sabbat for the first time ever had pushed the Camarilla out of Westchester.  Many of the Cammies who called Westchester home fled back into NYC.  For the Sabbat, Westchester was a valuable prize. It was the stepping stone into NYC.  However, before such grandiose plans could even be considered, the Sabbat still had to deal with the immediate task of securing their new territory.\n\nThe Camarilla expulsion left a vacuum of power in the area with various sects and groups licking their chops to lay claim.  Setites had set up shop peddling their wicked trades, a small pack of werewolves started to make noise, and a mysterious new sect of vampires known as Zetites had started marking the domain with cryptic graffiti.  On top if this, it was rumored that the old Camarilla sheriff of Westchester, Elmer Theese, still called the domain his home. \n\nAs pack FUBARs name indicated, its beginnings was birthed in disaster and misstep.  There was genuine mistrust and dysfunction between the pack.  It’s first two undertakings in the area were disastrous and left doubt between all its party members.  At the center was Colin, the Ventrue who true to his clan lusted for power and control.\n\nHow Remy found himself as Ductus he wasn’t too sure.  He didn’t ask for it, but it was thrust upon him nevertheless.  Two weeks prior he was brand new to the area and an unproven member of a new fledging pack under a different ductus and priest (Both NPCs).  That ductus met his end after the failed invasion of a Camarilla kindred’s haven who refused to leave Westchester after the Cammy exodus.  The attack was poorly planned (not planned at all!) and the pack paid the price for it.  The former Ductus met his final death and Sack was put into torpor.  Remy threw Sack on his shoulders and with the rest of the pack barely escaped the botched invasion.\n\nThe pack priest, Vanhelm of clan Brujah, while not there the night of the failed home invasion was nevertheless blamed by the Sabbat Priscus Varriac (an androgynous alien like Tzmitci) for the failure.  The priest was ordered to stake himself by the Priscus.  The Priscus then turned to the battered and wounded pack members and chided them for their foolish pride and missteps.  He woke Sack from torpor by feeding him his ancient and powerful blood.  The Priscus made it clear that the former priest Vanhelm would be punished and it would be up to us to determine his trial.  He then asked each member who they felt should be the new Ductus.  One by one each said a name.  This is how Remy found himself to be the new Ductus, much to the disgust and anger of Colin.  \n\nPack FUBAR was sent back to its haven to recover and contemplate its role in the new domain.  After recovering from its wounds the pack was called by the Priscus to complete a new trial and prove themselves worthy of the Sabbat cause.  The pack arrived at an old 18th century church the Priscus had claimed for his own not knowing what to expect.  As they walked into the old church magical clouds swirled around them and shadows of hyenas stalked in the dark fog.\n\nThe Priscus stood at the churches alter.  Behind him stood a large crucifix with a naked male human nailed to it.  His rib cage masterfully pulled open creating a morbid work of art.   He greeted the pack and brought them forth.  He told them a story.  \n\nA story of an ancient Canite who wandered alone in the deserts of Egypt while being stalked by a pack of Hyenas.  They followed him for weeks as he journeyed alone.  The canite knew it would only be a matter of time before the hyenas destroyed him.  So before his strength was fully sapped, he feigned injury to lure the pack of beasts in.  The hyenas were overconfident and struck at the vampire only to find that it was a trap.  The pack was no more.    It was a story meant to show that by feigning weakness one could gain the advantage.  The Priscuss then told us he wanted us to use the moral of this story and do something in the domain to prove ourselves.  What we would do was up to us.  \n\nWe sat and deliberated as pack.  How could we feign weakness?  It was Bugs who spoke up.  What if we viewed the story from a different perspective?  We weren’t the lone canite, but we were the pack of overconfident Hyenas.  We had failed at every task given to us at this point.  We were not a team.  What if this test was for us to show that we could work together as a pack and destroy the lone vampire.  \n\nThe pack nodded to each other and agreed this would be their unification as pack, a unification by battle and blood.  They would succeed or meet their final death trying.  Remy smiled, “God damn boys and missy, former Sheriff Elmer Theese.  It’s going to be a hell of a night.”    \n\nFormer Cammy Sheriff Elmer Theese was of clan Brujah and had earned both the respect and fear of the Camarilla and Sabbat alike.  He was a fixture in Westchester since the start.  The sound of his Harley was enough to send Sabbat running in fear.  He was a massive man whose combat prowess was unrivaled.  This would be our prize or we would die trying.  \n\nWe had no idea where his haven was located.  So instead of finding him, we came up with the plan to have him come to us.  We would break the masquerade, and in doing so we knew if he was still truly in Westchester he would come to deal with us.  He was to proud not too. \n\nAt the same time we would provide a trial for our former Priest Vanhelm.  We could kill two birds with one stone.  Vanhelm would be our bate in this trap.  If he survived he would prove himself worthy of the Sabbat and our pack.  \n\nWith a new purpose our pack worked and planned like we never had before.  The plan unfolded as follows:\n\nColin found a young college aged female.  She was no match as he dominated her will.  “Your life has been horrible.  Your boyfriend cheated on you with your best friend, your family and friends hate you and you hate yourself.  You want to go to the top of the City Center in White Plains and on that ledge of the roof you will stand and contemplate just how bad your life truly is.”\n\nThe girl had no choice but to do as told.  She climbed to the top of the parking garage and on the ledge broke down in anguish.  As this was happening the rest of the pack was at work. \n\nAubrey had set up shop across the way overlooking the city center with a sniper rifle.  She and Bugs had started calling local news channels about what appeared to be a young girl who might jump from the ledge.  \n\nRemy had entered into the square below the girl and pointed up.  “Look up there, she’s on the ledge!  Someone call for help!”.  Passerby’s had started to gather.  And as humanity does, instead of trying to help they took out their cellphones and started filming.  \n\nChannel 12 news arrived on the scene next.  A local reporter with a camera crew started to film.  Finally two patrol cars arrived.  Five cops jumped out.  They jumped into action, first barricading off the area below where the girl stood and attempted to control the slowly growing crowd that was gathering.  You could hear one of the cops under his breath, “Another God damn jumper, and I was about to get off shift….”.  \n\nAt this point the rest of the pack had taken their positions.  Once the crowd had gathered Remy had quietly snuck away into an alley overlooking the City Center square.  Bugs had obfuscated (basically gone invisible) and also watched from below.  Colin was a street away sitting in his Mercedes SUV, waiting for our signal.  Aubrey was perched with her sniper rifle ready.  \n\nDuring all of this, no one payed any attention to the two drunk homeless men that stumbled to a bench.  Covered in large blankets, one of the men looked like he had passed out from drinking too much.  The other covered in blankets helped support his friend.  It was at the point when the crowd had started to swell to its largest that Sack reached under the blanket and pulled out the stake that was resting in the heart of Priest Vanhelm.  \n\nThe former pack priest Vanhelm was very much a priest.  Of German decent, he wore traditional catholic priest garb.  As the stake was removed his eyes opened and the frenzy embraced him.  He needed to feed.  He needed blood.  Luckily there was a large crowd of humans to quench his thirst.  \n\nAt first the crowd didn’t realize what was happening.  (In game this was taking place near Halloween.)  They thought a drunk man dressed as a priest for Halloween was pulling a prank to get on TV.  That is until he went to the nearest young man in the crowd and ripped his throat out.  He started to feed, the blood pouring forth as he was in frenzy and overtaken by the hunger.  Panic started to erupt in the crowd.\n\nThe cameras turned their attention to the blood filled scene that was taking place.  Here was a priest who had just ripped the throat out of a man with his bare teeth.  The cops on the scene pulled their weapons on the priest.\nVanhelm turned toward the cops as they screamed for him to let go of the poor man who now lay drained.  He needed more blood.  He needed to feed.  \n\nHe stepped towards the nearest cop.  The cops handgun went off, hitting the priest in the chest.  Nothing, not even a flinch.  The enraged priest soaked the bullets and tackled the nearest cop.  \n\nOne cop was now on his radio screaming for backup.  That’s when the crack of a sniper rifle was heard and on live television the skull of a cop exploded like a brain filled cantaloupe.  \n\nAt this point the masquerade was completely broken.  Sack had made his way to the reporter and on live television shot the poor man to death.  The deranged man with a burlap sack for his face laughed into the camera, “We are here for you!  We are here for all of you!”.  \n\nMayhem was unfolding.  Sack was hit from the blast of a shotgun.  The blast should have killed any human instantly, and while it hurt, Sack still stood.  The rest of the camera crew and crowd had bolted running in fear.  \nThe priest was covered in blood as he continued to feed on the cop he tackled.  \n\nThe three remaining cops had taken cover behind one of the patrol cars when a dispatcher message came in.  “Please leave the area immediately.  We repeat, retreat from the area now!”  The cops didn’t have to be told twice.  They jumped in the car and booked it down the street.\n\nThe City Center square was now eerily quiet and empty.  It was not more than 15 seconds later we heard the loud renowned pipes of a Harley Davidson chopper a street away.  Elmer Theese was here.  \n\n(Ok, that’s the end of part 1.  I hadn’t intended to make it this long.  I apologize for any grammar/spelling mistakes.  If people dig it I can write up part 2 and the battle that ensued.  It was by far the most epic on the edge of the seat battle we have ever had with vampires.)\n",

        "text": "***A note before I begin: this game is set in the Star Wars universe just after Order 66 is issued. We're using a homebrew rpg system and I'm playing loose with the SW lore. Each part will be 2 sessions (probably) and breaks between games, and thereby events, and some scene transitions will be separated by a line similar to what's below this note (I couldn't figure out how to get a more prominent separation for sessions, if anyone knows how please tell me!). Edits will be made for spelling etc. as I find them. Enjoy :)***\n\n***\n\nZanatos and Rain had gotten lucky, no two ways about it. Freshly made Knights, they'd been sent to the edges of the galaxy to the Lipsec system to investigate reports of a series of disappearances that showed no sign of slowing. They'd only gone with a pair of clone troopers instead of the standard squad; no one expected much trouble this far away from the rest of the war. When the troopers had turned on them, they'd managed to make short work of them, only sustaining minor injuries despite being ambushed. Shaken, the two young Knights had made their way to a small smuggler outpost at the edge of the system and searched around for any news of this happening in the rest of the galaxy. To their horror, Jedi everywhere were reported as having been killed, betrayed by their own forces; allegedly, not even the Jedi Council had been as lucky as them in escaping treachery, or, at the least, any living members had already gone into hiding. Zanatos and Rain quickly decided they had to see for themselves - there was a Jedi outpost on the third moon of Vassek that had recently been setup - and spent all of their credits buying the services of a toydarian smuggler, WaguWagu, who agreed to take them to the outpost and overlook their Jedi status, temporarily.\n\nThe jungles of the third moon of Vassek rose beneath them as they began their descent. Scans had indicated the Jedi outpost was still standing, though there were no answers to the messages they'd sent while in orbit and the Knights were getting worried. As far as they knew, this had been a small operation with maybe four or five padawans training in relative isolation under a single master mixed in with maybe twenty or thirty transplants - smugglers, explorers, those looking for a fresh start on a new world. If the Jedi had been attacked and fallen, it wasn't likely any civilians survived either. WaguWagu landed the ship in a clearing within sight of the outpost and they disembarked. Zanatos took the lead, slipping quietly through the forest ahead of Rain and WaguWagu, and came upon the carnage first. The squat, two storey outpost was surrounded by the charred remains of tents and makeshift homes, firepits and knocked over storage units. Checking the tents, Zanatos was greeted by the stench of burnt skin and stale blood as the bodies of the inhabitants had been left where they were cut down, blaster wounds now days old.\n\n\"Shit,\" he muttered under his breath. He turned quickly toward Rain and WaguWagu, who had just broken the perimeter of the camp, and signalled that they should follow quickly and quietly.\n\nContinuing forward, Zanatos made his way into the outpost, drawing his blaster. The inside of the outpost was dark and the motion sensitive lights flickered once before failing, the generators off or damaged. The light from beyond the door just barely illuminated the nearly featureless bottom floor: a large makeshift table sat in the middle of the room, data slates and cups littered across it, surrounded by chairs, and a staircase to the second floor sat to the right. Igniting a glowrod from his belt, Zanatos crept up the steps onto the balcony of the second floor. There were doors to his left and right that had been cut through - possibly a plasma torch? - and one in front of him that seemed untouched. He reached out to the door panel in front of him and it opened to an empty meditation room, thin mats still strewn around.\n\n\"Zanatos!\" Rain whispered from the floor below, quickly marching up the steps and nodding to his friend. WaguWagu stomped his way up the stairs behind them.\n\n\"WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING? THERE'S LOTS OF BODIES OUTSIDE, ARE YOU SURE THIS IS SAFE?\"\n\n\"Shush WaguWagu! There might still be enemies here, we should look around quietly\" scolded Rain, before moving to the cut door to the right. \n\n\"WELL OKAY IF YOU GUYS SAY SO\" said WaguWagu, following, barely quieter, after him with Zanatos bringing up the rear. Together, they walked up to the bisected door and pried it open, revealing the remains of a communications room: screens and work stations had blaster holes through them and blood stained the floor, leading to a caved in door and unlit room at the back. Rain and WaguWagu set about picking through the remains of the comms stations, eventually finding a data slate hidden behind the wreckage of a viewscreen. Rain turned it on, scimming, before growling in frustration.\n\n\"Blasted- it's written in some kind of code. I can't make much of it except...\" he paused, scanning more slowly through the files, \"Hold on, there's a partial map here! Looks like coordinates of some kind, still on this moon I think.\"\n\n\"Let me see!\" said WaguWagu, grabbing the slate from Rain's hands. \"Mmm yes, there might be something here worth lots of credits! Hey guy! We should totally go here!\" he finished, looking to Zanatos.\n\nZanatos ignored the two of them, following the trail of blood to the back of the room. Raising his glowrod, his breath caught at the source of the ichor. A Jedi - a knight going by his robes - had been slammed into the reinforced wall at the back of the server room, his back a mess of red pulp, blood dripping from where bones had met steel and ripped flesh. Kneeling, Zanatos muttered a quick prayer before investigating further, \"...Whoever did this had to be strong with the force; the strength of the push had to be immense to overcome a knight\". Quickly patting down the body, Zanatos swore, \"No saber.\"\n\nRain moved to Zanatos as the latter got up, shaking his head. They exchanged a look before walking back to WaguWagu who was scrounging through the mass of technology for parts, a new cred-chip he'd found in his mouth.\n\n\"Come on WaguWagu, there's nothing else in this room\" said Rain, pushing past him.\n\n\"If you say so!\"\n\nThe trio went to the final door on this floor - it was damaged, like the last, but opened nonetheless. Inside were the bodies of the padawans, all killed by blaster fire, sprawled out amidts a number of metal-framed cots. Against the outer wall, a miraluka had been impaled by several lengths of metal, her right arm severed just below the elbow.\n\n\"Hot damn!\" WaguWagu said as the two knights ran to the miraluka.\n\n\"Master's robes\" Rain whispered harshly at his friend. Zanatos nodded, searching for signs of a lightsaber. He had little luck as it seemed to have been taken from her; instead, he found a white kyber crystal hidden away in the folds of her cloak. Stealing a glance at WaguWagu - busy working his way through a pair of clone troopers he'd found amid the mass of bodies - Zanatos tucked the crystal into his belt and kept searching. As the trio continued to work through the room, a sound came from the floor below them.\n\n\"Roger, we just finished checking out the ship our scanners picked and are going to do a quick recon of the outpost.\" the voice paused, \"Yes, general. Over and out.\"\n\n\"Clone troopers!\" hissed Zanatos.\n\n\"WHAT?\" shouted WaguWagu as he pulled a battered blaster from the hands of a dead clone trooper.\n\nZanatos dropper his glowrod and slid his way out the door and onto the balcony, hiding in the darkness as much as behind the railing. Moving in unison, Rain stepped up beside the door, hand falling to his saber. Below, Zanatos saw two troopers advance slowly up the steps, clearly looking in the direction of WaguWagu's shout. As they advanced down the balcony, coming to a stop a few feet from the door, Zanatos hopped over the railing, ran silently across bottom floor, jumped, pushing himself with the force, and landed behind the last trooper. Focusing his will, he spoke quietly, \"There's no need to be alarmed. Rest now.\" The trooper grunted, shaking his head as his movements slowed. Just as Zanatos lept from the balcony, Rain stepped out and pushed against the forward clone trooper with his will, slamming him against the railing but failing to incapacitate him.\n\n\"Intruders! Call command!\" said the first clone trooper as he reached into his pouch and tossed a grenade into the room.\n\nRain jumped immediately back, kicking up a bed frame to protect him, while WaguWagu screamed and ducked behind the pile of bodies he'd been looting. The grenade exploded on impact, sending fragments across the room. Several caught WaguWagu just as he ducked but not enough to do any severe damage, the rest embedding into the metal bed frame and the bodies.\n\n\"Shit!\" the clone trooper in front of Zanatos swore, turning around and rushing past the knight, hand against the communicator in his helmet.\n\nAs the ringing of the explosion subsided, Rain burst from the room, lightsaber in hand, and ran the first clone trooper through the chest, quickly extinguishing his sword as the trooper fell over the railing. A second later, WaguWagu stepped out of the room firing his blaster from the hip and hitting the other trooper in the back of the head, killing him.\n\n\"PHEW! Well that was close - why didn't you do anything Zanatos?!\"\n\n\"I was trying to stop him from calling back-\"\n\n\"You should have helped me, Zanatos. I can't fight them all myself!\" Rain interjected.\n\n\"Ugh, I just- Listen, we need to get out of here. They know about your ship, WaguWagu.\"\n\nAlready grabbing the troopers' blasters, WaguWagu nodded, \"Okay, well let me just strip these guys first and we'll find a nice place to hide.\"\n\nDone picking the bodies clean, they ran back to the ship and quickly took off, finding a secluded cave along the side of a canyon, a few clicks away from the outpost, to hide the ship.\n\n***\n\nAfter resting and spending some time deciphering the data slate they found, it seemed to be reports of scouting missions to a Separatist facility believed to be the home of the late General Greivous. With only partial coordinates and a lot of anger, Zanatos and Rain initially decided the facility wasn't worth finding and that they should focus on finding the Sith that had killed the miraluka Jedi master. However, WaguWagu managed to convince them to quickly check the moon in case the person they were looking for was operating out of Greivous' base. Luckily, they managed to find the Separatist facility and set down just outside of scanning range, choosing to approach in stealth.\n\nReaching the edge of the clearing around the facility, the trio took a moment to observe the base. Nestled into the middle of a denser part of the jungle, it looked like a much larger structure had once stood in it's place as construction ships sat abandoned next to half dismantled columns of metal. What was left of the base was still defensible, but not nearly as vast: a short, one storey bunker with large blast doors, a small communications tower attached to a guard building and a few, empty, watchtowers scattered around the clearing. There was also a large clearing with a landing pad just to the right of the bunker; a single light freighter took up a majority of the pad. On guard around the base was a sparse half a dozen clone troopers and a droideka. As they continued to watch, a figure emerged from the light freighter and started making its way to the bunker doors.\n\n\"General Greivous? I thought he'd been killed months ago?\" Rain said incredulously. Neither of his companions had much to say against that and the three of them simply watched as Greivous entered the bunker.\n\nLooking at the other two, Zanatos whispered, \"Alright. I'm going to see if I can get inside that bunker. Help me take out one of the clone troopers, I'll disguise myself, and then see what you can find in the communications tower.\"\n\nThey nodded at each other and made their way to the door of the communications tower, keeping the closest trooper in sight as he edged ever closer to the side of the building. Once there, WaguWagu started working on the door while Rain stepped forward and reached out to the nearest clone trooper, forcibly pulling him toward the group, cutting the trooper's head off mid-flight to avoid damaging much of the visible armour pieces. Quickly stripping the trooper and donning the disguise, Zanatos left the other two for the bunker. Rain dragged the now naked body inside as WaguWagu quickly started searching for valuables. \n\nThe inside of the communications building was relatively open, consisting of a lower floor of viewscreens and work stations and an upper floor made out of steel scaffolding and a series of connected patforms - the only way to access the base of the communication dish's power relay - along the wall, next to a set of windows. \n\n\"You search this floor, I'm going head up and see if I can't get a better look of the base and Zanatos' progress from the windows.\" Rain said, making for the upper floor. WaguWagu paid little attention to Rain as he booted up the work stations, looking for any interesting information or cargo and supply lists.\n\n\"Hrm. Hey Rain! Says here they started using this place a few days ago to store some stuff. I dunno if it's the real Greivous or not though! Are you listening Rain? RAIIIINNN!\"\n\n\"Shut up WaguWagu!\" sighed Rain, watching as Zanatos made his way past the bunker doors and disappeared inside with a group of four other unsuspecting clone troopers. Just below him, not 10 feet from the door to the communications building, however, the last clone trooper was looking around and waving at the droideka to join him. As the droideka slowly made it's way over, shield humming to life, the clone trooper began advancing, gun drawn and eyeing Rain through the window.\n\n\"I think they noticed me, watch out!\" Rain shouted as he drew his lightsaber and jumped through the window. The clone trooper below cired out as shattered glass rained down on him, followed swiftly by Rain who slashed across the trooper's chest, killing him. As the trooper went down, the droideka advanced on Rain and started firing at him. WaguWagu made a break for the edge of the base, as Rain dodged and deflected the droid's attacks, and disappeared into the dense jungle. \n\n***\n\nInside the bunker, Zanatos found himself staring at Greivous' back as the general listened intently to a woman on a large viewscreen. The woman had grey skin and two pairs of small red horns running along her head, partially concealed by her black hair; behind her were two black-robed humans with Sith sabers at their waist.\n\n\"Finally, I will be returning to Thyferra and my two apprentices will make their way to Malastare to ensure the completion of the next batch of droids. Expect a number of units to be delivered to you shortly, GR-A1\" she said.\n\n\"As you order it, Commander\" replied GR-A1 in a deep droid's voice, saluting, \"I will oversee the delivery and maintenance of the shipment as well as investigate the reports of smugglers at the Jedi's outpost.\"\n\nThe viewscreen shut off then and GR-A1 turned to Zanatos, and the four other clone troopers, and pointed at him, \"You. Do a rundown of our last supply drop and have the contents moved to storage. The rest of you, as you were.\"\n\nThe other four clone troopers made their way to the single other door inside the bunker while Zanatos moved to the shipping crates at the back of the room. The GR-A1 droid seemed to return its attention to the viewscreen, running through patrol reports.  Zanatos had just opened a crate of munitions when the sounds of blaster fire rang through the walls. The four clone troopers came out of their room and made their way to the door, stopping only when Zanatos ran up to them, waving them down.\n\n\"Hey guys, listen, uh, would you mind if I just go check this out? My partner's out there and I'm pretty sure he's just practicing or something.\"\n\n\"Negative, ON-491, we'll take it from here. The general gave you an order to check the supplies.\" one of the troopers answered, \"Besides, I'm sure it's nothing.\"\n\nWith that, they opened the blast door and headed outside. Zanatos swore under his breath, hesitating a moment before force grabbing one of the grenades from the crate he'd been inspecting and slipping outside as GR-A1 was turning to address him.\n\n***\n\nBack outside, Rain was holding his own against the droideka. He'd managed to break through its shield once by sacrificing his guard and taking wounds to his stomach and right leg. He was getting to the end of his endurance and was breathing hard when the blast doors opened and four more clone troopers came rushing out, weapons raising as they saw him. Rain retreated, avoiding the droideka's heavier blaster fire and rushing behind the corner of the communications building. He made it just in time for the clone troopers to start firing as they advanced, closing on him alongside the droideka.\n\n\"Where the hell is everyone?!\" he shouted in frustration, bolts screaming across the base and pounding into the wall behind him. Suddenly, he heard an explosion and the blasters stopped firing. Rain took a peek past the edge of the wall and saw the blasted bodies of the clone troopers beside the wreck of what was left of the droideka. Zanatos was walking toward him and taking off his clone trooper helmet, speaking quickly, \"Rain, it's the Sith. They've built some kind of Greivous-bot or something and are using his base as a staging ground.\" \n\nAs he finished, the bunker doors opened again and another trio of clone troopers and GR-A1 emerged.\n\n\"Oh shit!\" said Zanatos as he ran behind the wall with Rain. A volley of laser cannon fire blew past him as WaguWagu's ship came over the canopy, laying into the Greivous bot and the clone troopers, instantly vaporizing two of the troopers.\n\n\"YAHAHAHAAA! TAKE THAT CLONES!\" came WaguWagu's voice through the ship's loud speakers, barely audible over the sound of continuous cannon fire. Pressing their new advantage, Rain and Zanatos rushed toward the Greivous bot and last remaining clone trooper while WaguWagu drifted closer for a better shot. GR-A1 drew four vibroblades from his cloak, arms extending as he stepped forward to face the Jedi, WaguWagu's cannon fire blasting around him and vaporizing the last clone trooper. Zanatos drew up short, pulling up his blaster in favour of his lightsaber, and started firing at the Greivous bot, landing a blow against the plating of one of the arms. Rain surged in quickly, saber flashing twice; the first slash was deflected by one of the droid's vibroblades, coated in cortosis, but the second blazed quickly past and severed one of its arms. The droid responded with a pair of its own slashes, one aimed at Rain's head and the other at his abdomen. Rain tried to bend away from the blade that sliced at his stomach as he brought his saber up to his head, but he was too slow and the deep cut started spilling blood. Then, servos whirring, the droid leapt up onto WaguWagu's ship as the toydarian tried to clip him with the wing. Rain followed the droid up, leaving Zanatos on the ground as the ship swayed dangerously.\n\nRain steadied himself atop the ship, bringing his lightsaber up in a defensive stance as GR-A1 charged him, three remaining blades whirling in a wall of steel. The first blade came in high toward Rain's right shoulder, the second flashing in from the left as the Jedi managed the parry the high strike. Jumping over the blade, Rain managed to kick GR-A1 in the shoulder as the third swing was starting, sending the droid tumbling back. Rain leapt forward after landing and brought his saber down in a two handed strike, pressing the attack against the temporarily unstable droid. The slash came down hard but slightly misjudged, cleaving through one of the lower arms but missing the main chest chassis. He didn't relent though, swinging the lightsaber back up and shearing part of the droid's jaw as GR-A1 brought his remaining vibroblades down in a heavy double bladed strike, aiming for Rain's head. The Jedi stepped back, bringing his saber up to block the blow as the tremendous strength of it brought him to one knee, straining. Calling on the Force, Rain screamed as he pushed back, throwing the blades to the side and slashing upward with all his might. GR-A1, caught off balance again as his blades slammed into the roof of the ship, tried to pull away from Rain's spinning form but was too slow. Rain's lightsaber cut through the reinforced plating of the droid's chest and kept going, cutting through servos and wires with ease before coming free on the other side of the now severed chassis. The two halves of the Greivous bot fell off the ship as it powered down and Rain leapt off with it, clutching his wounds. Zanatos ran up to Rain and the remains of the droid as WaguWagu started landing the ship beside them, squeezing it into the clearing.\n\n\"Well done Rain!\"\n\n\"No thanks to you, you really need to learn to be proficient with your lightsaber Zanatos.\"\n\n\"Look we don't have time for that now. Like I was saying before, there's a Sith Lord that's been using this base as a staging ground for something. I heard her say she was heading to Thyferra and her apprentices were going to go to Malastare to oversee some kind of production at a factory there.\"\n\n\"...Do you think they could maybe be producing more of these Greivous droids?!\" Rain exclaimed as WaguWagu got out of the ship and ambled over to them.\n\nMaking his way past the two Jedi into the bunker, WaguWagu shouted, \"Hey what are you guys talking about? We should loot this base and get the hell outta here!\"\n\nZanatos shook his head as he turned back to Rain, \"Shit, if they're building more of those droids we have to stop them. We really can't have more of these running around the Galaxy. I think Thyferra can wait. If the droids are being built on Malastare, we need to go there right now.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\nRain and Zanatos ran into the bunker to grab WaguWagu and the supplies, telling him they needed to go to Malastare before any more of the Greivous bots could be made. The smuggler agreed so long as he could sell all the scrap and supplies from this base as the cost for his continued services and the Jedi had no choice but to accept that deal. They loaded what they could find onto their ship and made their way to Malastare.",

        "text": "So, firstly, prefacing this by saying I’m the GM in this story, and these players are fairly new to Shadowrun in general. So I’ve been letting them get away with some pretty dumb stuff, choosing to slowly ease them into the universe and rules, instead of beating their D&amp;D brains with everything at once. This is also a bi-weekly game, with the other weeks being Pathfinder, so that may be a contributing factor to the mess that is this story.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur party consists of:\n\n    One(1) Human Rigger, by the name of Jane Smith, the team’s driver and arguably most competent Shadowrun player, being the only one who had really played before this game, just not as a rigger. The player is male, but he’s playing a female character, so I’ll mostly be refering to them as well, them, because otherwise I’d be flip-flopping back and forth and it might get confusing.\n\n    One(1) Dryad Face/Mage, alias Chimen, who is decidedly not a shadowrunner, whose player is otherwise fairly competent at tabletop RPGs in general. This was a mistake I immediately regretted, as the player is playing dumb at every possible opportunity, despite his munchkin character’s stats, though he is getting better about it. Can be inflexible.\n\n    One(1) Oni Beastmaster, named Ding Hammond, a Druid Combat Summoner with mostly fluffy spells, including Bear Form. Three guesses what spell he defaults to every time, first two don’t count. The player is also pretty new to the concept of playing a tabletop RPG, including things like paying attention.\n\n    One(1) Batman. Human mundane B&amp;E Infiltrator, solid character, who looks and tries to act like Batman. He’s Batman. The player good at his role, but true to his inspiration, cannot work with the rest of the party effectively.\n\n    Mix thoroughly for Stupid Antics, Easily Distracted and Hyper-Focused Plans, and pretty much no Professionalism or Common Sense, but Absolute Enjoyment and Hilarity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’m not going to say I’m not at fault for how this game has turned out, far from it, but I am the kind of GM who favours rule of cool, the players having fun, and telling a good story, so you play the hand you’re dealt, I guess. The campaign takes place in my own version of Toronto, because I’ve never been a fan of following canon, and because I prefer to set my games in locations familiar to me and my players, if we happen to be on Earth.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, the jobs they have been on have been a framing job against a well hated politician to get him out of the running, that quickly turned into a rescue mission, a job from Batman’s commissioner contact to take out a gang causing trouble for everyone, and a run against a dockyard lockup to steal contraband. This third run went sideways, and although they succeeded, their contact for the run, a smuggler with some friends around the city, decided to call in a favour and set these guys up with a tutor. They then played capture-the-flag, to prove that they weren’t completely useless as runners, and passing that, they were promised more opportunities to sharpen their skills and learn some much needed teamwork.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur story starts about an hour and twenty minutes after it should have, because it’s that kind of table. Up until now we’ve had a pretty big problem with getting distracted, especially one player who would be watching YouTube or playing games on his laptop whenever he wasn’t being called out by the GM. I recently solved this problem by limiting him to using a phone, my phone, for his character sheet, and getting pretty much everyone else to use it was a nice bonus, as it’s cut down on distractions once the game gets rolling. The first thing we did was have a lengthy discussion on how much half the party should spend paying their debts, with Batman hmming and hawing over the rest of the party’s input on saving some money in case of an emergency. Once that was sorted, the party grouped up and headed to their meet. Upon arriving, the party were told what had happened, a mob run warehouse/black market location was hit by a group of thieves and they wanted their goods back. The party was warned that a nice Americar like the one the rigger was driving was likely to get looted by local gangers if left unattended too long, so the party wisely agreed to move it elsewhere, as they figured they'd be awhile. Batman proceeded to tell the Rigger to go park it themselves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Rigger and Ding decide to do so, leaving our face and Batman to investigate. Batman decides to first check the warehouse for clues, specifically tracks from a forklift or other lifting device. The table agreed that it was a long shot, but he rolled well, so I gave him a better direction to look at, while Chimen went about trying to gather information from the workers. His first plan of trying to get a manifest from the managers did not work out like he had hoped, and begrudgingly went about getting information in other ways, talking with the merchants to learn that weapons and drugs were stolen, although no one is sure from who, and it was most likely a local group of gangers, although no one is sure which one. At this point the rest of the party returned from parking their car in a secure location, and Batman had found a point in the fence that had been tampered with and cleverly put back together to disguise its’ use as an entrance. Based off of the location of the break in, and what the party had gleamed about the local gangs, it boiled down to two real choices, A Halloweener knock off group, and an Ancients knock off group, mostly because I was feeling lazy about creating factions whose sole purpose was going to be “Get mowed down by the party because they happen to be standing between them and their goal.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDeciding that the Dryad was better suited to the Ancients, The Rigger got clowned up, and rolled magnificently on their disguise check, and up to the Halloweeners rolled the lead singer of Insane Clown Posse, who was immediately accepted in. Ding, having learned something from their last encounter with gangs, decided to just walk on up and say he wanted to join, which worked, mostly because “It’s a big-ass Oni, dude’s gotta be strong, and we can use that.” Batman, because he took the Distinctive Style quality, and I’m holding him to it, comes to the conclusion that Batman probably won’t be welcome into a gang, so he sneaks around to look for another entrance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt’s at this point something magical happens, and I hope you’re ready for it. The party finds the boxes, and now have to decide how to get them out. The Dryad realizes they need a way to move the cargo, and goes to steal an 18-wheeler. At this point I remembered what setting we were in and reminded that Rigger that he could remotely retrieve his car, and promptly apologized for only remembering it at that moment, with the rigger calling his car in case they needed to make a quick getaway. The rest of the party wonders how to get Batman into the building to get the stuff moved, and the Rigger has a plan. He gets a spray can of body paint, and tells Ding to change into a bear. Upon doing so, the Rigger paints the Bear Neon Orange and gives him a mohawk, whispering him to go smash one of the crates, pretending to be blinded, so they can make a distraction. He finds weapons, which seals the deal for the party.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Weeners eat this up, and start egging the bear on, because “YEAH, SMASH SHIT!” In secret I roll to see which box he hit next, and it happened to be a crate of Kamikaze, which explodes in the face of the bear and crowd of gangers that have converged on the scene. The Rigger, in a very handwavey manner informs me that they are still wearing their ballistic mask and they turn on their gas mask. The rest of the crowd proceed to get high off the substance, and the bear, now drugged out of his mind, decides that smashing crates is FUCKING AWESOME, and continues to do it. Batman takes the opportunity to sneak in, and decides to add to the chaos by throwing a smoke grenade into the crowd. So we now have a drugged up bear and drugged up gangers, with little to no visibility. The bear, at this point swinging wildly, hits another crate, one filled with packets of Novacoke. You now have Coked Up Rage Halloweener Bear, let the majesty of that sink in a moment, in all its’ short lived glory.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor those of you not entirely familiar with the rules of Shadowrun, I wouldn’t blame you, drugs have overdosing rules which state that “If two drugs have a shared effect, the user has to resist stun damage equal to the sum of the addiction ratings, using body and willpower”. Novacoke and Kamikaze both provide the user with High Pain Tolerance, which means there’s an overlap. None of the effected people make their saves, something like 16S, and the whole party collapses to the ground, high as a kite. Ding, having gone unconscious, returns to Oni form, naked and content. I’d be lying if I said I was hoping that the character had picked up an addiction from this, but he made all the required saves, and got off scot-free.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, the Dryad arrives with 18-wheeler and tells the party to start loading up the rig. They wisely decide to wake up Ding, using a stim patch. You now have an alert, combat ready, drugged up Oni, Batman, ICP’s lead singer, and the hottest fucking elf you ever did see, stealing weapons and drugs from a Weener knock off group, some of whom were not attracted by the party downstairs. Combat ensues. In a rare vindictive moment, the rest of the party agrees that Batman should load up the truck while they provide support. The player makes no argument about it, agreeing that the initial action was really dickish, and that he deserved this. Combat goes rather smoothly, after explaining to the player that he would have better armor as an Oni(17+Bod, versus 3+Bod as a bear), and these guys had guns on the second floor, although he ends up taking the only damage of the group, at 2S. With the truck loaded up, the party speeds off in two vehicles, marking the end of the session. Off the record I informed the party a bit of my plans for the next session, including the first lesson in “consequences”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt’s really rambley, and I'm sorry for that if it made it hard to read, but I hope you enjoyed part one of this story. I intend to post part two, with a link [here] when it’s up, but if you like this, and want to hear more, I can go back and post the Dockyard and ganger run, as the initial run was pretty bog standard and mostly forgettable, and maybe post the rest as it happens. Honestly, for all the drawbacks and problems, this is easily one of my favourite campaigns I've run or played in, and I feel once the party gets it together, it'll be one of the best we've played in a long time.",

        "text": "[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5xu2l0/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSeptember 30th &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRusty Dragon Inn, Sandpoint&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDearest Jemma,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirstly, I must thank you for your faithful correspondence. Each letter from home is a most welcome distraction from our current situation. What started out as a lark has, I’m sad to report, turned deadly. Do not worry – my friends and I remain in good health, at least for now. But the Kaijitsu family and our friend Ameiko have suffered most dreadfully in the past 24 hours, and the town of Sandpoint is poised on the brink of great tragedy.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur tale began its nasty spiral this morning, when we met for breakfast in the main tavern. Instead of being greeted by Ameiko and her fabulous cooking, we found ourselves faced with the near-hysterical serving girl. Ameiko had not shown up for the morning prep shift. Desperate, the girl had searched Ameiko’s quarters and found a note from her brother, Tsuto, asking her to meet him at the Glassworks and relaying concerns that their father was somehow involved in the recent goblin issues. While the note itself aroused our suspicions mightily, we headed at once for the local Glassworks to see if Ameiko could be found. Besides being a fine woman and a good friend, she makes the best coffee I’ve ever had – she is invaluable!&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Glassworks appeared to be operating normally, with smoke billowing from the chimneys. Closer inspection, however, raised our hackles. The doors were shut and firmly locked, and all the curtains drawn. Normally a bustling business, the place seemed almost deserted. Adriel deftly picked the lock while I did my best to distract passing townsfolk and allay their suspicion. While not entirely successful, we did manage to gain entry without arousing too much notice. Once inside, our suspicions were confirmed and our fears mounted. The showroom had been trashed, with broken glass covering nearly every square inch. Moving carefully, we crept through the building in search of Ameiko and her family, hoping we weren’t too late. In the furnace room we found eight goblins and, more disturbingly, seven corpses.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWithout hesitation, Rye began firing hexes and Sirus sent a volley of spells. Adriel and Barbie unsheathed their weapons and stepped into the fray, and I began reciting another tale of bravery and courage. The goblins attacked immediately, throwing glass and attacking from all angles. Several of the more enterprising little bastards used hot tongs from the fire, leaving deep scorch marks in Adriel’s armor and burning him badly. Flying into a rage, Barbie used her great axe as a bat to knock one of the goblins clean off its feet and into the furnace. His dying screams echoed through the cavernous room, sending fear into his fellow marauders and giving our band a needed boost of courage.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile Sirus continued to battle expertly with both magic and sword, and while Barbie continued her deadly stampede, I snuck through the chaos to heal Adriel’s burns. Stepping onto the battlefield brought forth a fierceness that I had never before experienced – suddenly, I had the most overwhelming desire to join the battle and fight with my comrades. Filled with a sense of righteousness, I ran forth and whacked one of the prone goblins in the face with my hammer; he died instantly. Okay, yes – he was already unconscious and badly wounded and would have died from blood loss within minutes. That’s not the point at all! My trusty hammer is covered with the blood of battle, and my heart is filled with a sense of true purpose. I have stood on the field of battle and emerged a warrior!&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs I attended to my victim, Sirus and Adriel tied up the surviving goblins and locked them in a cupboard for later questioning. When the proverbial smoke cleared, we discovered an eighth body – Lonjiku Kaijitsu, Ameiko’s father. He lay frozen in a sphere of molten glass, fear and pain still clearly etched on his handsome face; his death had been gruesome. We had not been friends in life, but I mourned his passing all the same. This suffering, this unspeakable cruelty, was difficult to witness. Even now, far from the sights and smells of that time, my heart clutches with the remembering.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nContinuing our search of the building, we found several offices and staff rooms, but nothing of interest. No more goblins were found (thank goodness!). In the basement we came across a tunnel opening. It appeared to have been bricked over in the past and recently smashed open. Assuming we’d found the goblins path into Sandpoint, I immediately stepped into the tunnel to investigate further. As I did so, a door opened further down the hall and a man appeared. He held a bow with the casual ease of an expert marksman, and demanded to know why we were trespassing. When Adriel and Sirus explained that we were searching for Ameiko who we believed to be in great danger, the stranger said nothing. Instead, he raised his bow and shot at Adriel, narrowly missing. Barbie screamed in fury and launched herself down the hall towards the stranger. I’m not sure it was panic or sheer stupidity, but the man dropped his bow and threw a punch, connecting solidly with Barbie’s jaw.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFrom the protection of the tunnel, hoping to prevent further bloodshed, I sent a telepathic whisper to the stranger. “We mean you no harm,” I explained. “We’re here to find Ameiko, to help her.” Sirus and Adriel sheathed their weapons to demonstrate our peaceful intentions; Barbie growled, but did not move. Apparently my powers of persuasion were not enough – the man panicked and ran. Rye let fly a complex hex and Adriel blocked his escape. I took the opportunity to heal the wounded Barbie, who wasted no time in chasing the man down and landing a devastating blow. Followed with a bit of magic from Sirus, the man fell to the ground, unconscious.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe man – of course, it was Ameiko’s brother, Tsuto – was quickly restrained and locked in a room and we continued our search. At last, we found Ameiko. Weakened but alive, she smiled when we burst into the room. Adriel quickly healed her wounds, and we told her about her father’s death. She smiled sadly and said “I always told him his work would consume him one day.” She told us about finding the letter from her brother, coming to the Glassworks, speaking to Tsuto. “He wanted to take me away from Sandpoint,” she said. “To protect me from what’s coming.” When she refused to join him, the goblins had attacked.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA brief read-through of Tsuto’s journal explained Ameiko’s chilling reference to “what’s coming”. It seems a massive attack had been planned, and the town of Sandpoint was in grave danger. After exploring the tunnel for a while, we quickly gathered the unconscious Tsuto and the captured goblins and headed back to town. Besides longing for a bit of rest and a warm meal, we needed time to interrogate our prisoners and read the journal in detail. If a battle was indeed upon us, we needed to prepare.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd so, Jemma, I write to you this evening with a heavy heart. We saved Ameiko, but many other lives were lost today. I’ve studied the journal with Sirus and Adriel, and the news is grim. In a few moments, we will begin the interrogation of Tsuto, to try and find out as much as we can about the coming attack and about the mysterious demon woman he mentions with such lusty admiration. Hopefully we can prevent further bloodshed and save the town from what seems to be certain destruction. With a bit of luck, I’ll write to you in a day’s time with better news and tales of victory. But should this letter prove to be my last, please know that I have always loved you best, dear sister.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith deepest affection,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWillow Berrypipe&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/60w25w/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)",

        "text": "So yesterday, I went and took part in a massive game experience known as Watch the Skies, sponsored by the group [Maryland Megagames](https://www.facebook.com/MarylandMegagames/). Watch the Skies is basically a cross between Model UN and XCOM, a game of diplomacy mixed with invasions from the stars, made famous by the board game review site [Shut Up and Sit Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN71v9H_gg8). I was on the United Kingdom team, playing as the Prime Minister. My team consisted of a deputy Prime Minister, a Science minister, a Defense minister, and a UN representative, as did the other seven human nations (US, France, Russia, China, Japan, Brazil, India). The Alien team had at least ten members, and there were three players assigned to different news agencies.\n\nGame started off with a big technological sharing deal, which worked really well for most of the game. The UK, France, US, and Russia all agreed to meet up in London with diplomats in order to have organized technology sharing. This was great for us since we wouldn’t have to pay to send diplomats for tech work because they were in London to begin with, and apparently my tech guy did a lot of good trading because of it. We also did some useless nonsense with the French in agreeing to jointly defend Europe, and we were able to come to an agreement with the Russians about setting up a dividing line in Europe about where we would be able to influence.\n\nI went and got a number of these things published in the news, and invested a fair bit into PR, which worked out pretty well for us after a few turns. We were swimming in cash after a little bit, and I was able to fulfill my teammate’s requests for money pretty easily. My tech guy was able to stay on target with our larger plans, our military was able to deploy pretty much wherever we needed to, and I pretty much just let my UN Representative ask for money and then ignore whatever he was doing at the table in the corner.\n\nThis would later prove to be a mistake.\n\nThe south pacific was the big flashpoint of the early game with lots of strange things going on in Papua-New Guinea, New Zealand, and Australia. Certainly troubling were the news reports that the Chinese Military had invaded Australia and were killing Kangaroos. I’m fairly sure that this was one of the rumors handed out at the beginning of the day in order to let the science people do things on turn one before the aliens fell from the sky, but it was also something I was certainly worried about. Turns out that it was not a military unit, but rather a diplomat, which was better but not great (This was our first encounter with what would be a plague of fake news throughout the game. This was a combination of miscommunication between the Media and players, as well as a few actions that were not so morally ambiguous). I've recently found out that the Chinese had learned one Kangaroo had an alien artifact in its pouch, and so they just started killing all of them because they didn't know which one had it, but regardless I began to make it clear that Australia was off limits to everyone but us, given that they were our ally at this point. We began to reinforce our allies, Australia, South Africa, and Pakistan (Also, thanks to the Indian President for being super cool about us putting some ground troops in Pakistan, we assured him that it was just a garrison force, and they felt confident working with us. We got along rather well whenever we talked, but when they joined with the Russians and Chinese who we were very concerned about made us wary of them later on in the game.)\n\nLater on, still with the conflicts in the South Pacific, I began to hear rumors of riots in New Zealand, perhaps involving the people from New Guinea waking up there without their memories. It was shortly thereafter that I overheard the UN table saying that “Every nation pledges one dollar, the United Kingdom pledges two,” which made me very concerned about what my UN Representative was doing giving away my money, and should have been a cue to put a tighter leash on him. However, it was basically funding to quell the riots in New Zealand, which we were already doing, and we were at the lead of the operation. So I let it slide as it let me prop myself to the media and get a bunch of PR out of being the defender of world peace. Shortly after that, I learned that the Russians did not bring the funds they needed for the operation, which led to a tense conversation with the Russian president. He was quite apologetic, saying it had been financial miscommunication and mismanagement, not ill intent. I did believe him, but we weren’t friendly with the Russians, so I had my deputy go to the GNN (One of the player-run media agencies), and soon we had a story reading “Russia mismanages funds...People in New Zealand die!”\n\nThis did not make the Russians happy, but since they didn’t know we were responsible, they blamed the news instead. The Russian president approached me, and he asked if I would support a resolution in the United Nation which put the press under the control of the Heads of State – We would have to approve everything they wrote. I was fairly strongly against this, but as luck would have it, the Science and Financial Times player happened to hear this as he was walking by, and concerned about the threat to his free speech, chose to leave Russia and go to Iceland. One of my person goals was to turn a player news agency into the BBC, so I immediately went to talk to him as soon as I found that out, and convinced him to come to London instead. This had no impact on the mechanics of the game, but it did establish a strong relationship between the BBC and the UK – I went to him almost exclusively for the rest of the game. The Russians, however, seeing the press now under the control of the west, got very scared at this point, and I was told later on that this action basically set the Russians against us long term, seeing us as their primary threat.\n\nThis wasn’t the only time the UK slandered folks in the media. Our science player had been concerned about what was going on with science from the Chinese, so he secretly went to the press and made allegations that China was involved in forced labor of its science consultants. This royally pissed the Chinese off, was another thing in the long line of fake news that they were subject too through the entire game. I want them to know, I didn’t know about that until lunch, no idea we were responsible until then.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of all that, I saw a report from GNN saying that the UK gave GNN access to basic alien technology. I was very confused, as we 100% didn’t do that. I went and talked to GNN, and I’m still not sure if he knew how things happened or if he was just stonewalling me. I did start to shift my involvement away from GNN around this point, and when it happened again later in the game, basically the same thing happened. That said, it didn’t seem to have a negative effect, so I didn’t worry about it.\n\nPretty soon, we got our two main power blocs for the rest of the game going. We were a little surprised to see India join in the single currency with the Russians and Chinese, and it gave us a lot of pause with them going forward. In response, we got the rest of the world together, with Japan and Brazil coming to join the US, UK, and France in a Free Trade Zone. After a little bit, and with some haggling with the US, that bloc created a new currency with which we could trade with the Aliens. Apparently, however, the UN was about to create a single world currency instead of a rival bloc currency, and they were very upset when we did this.\n\nIt was around this time I made the Queen of England immortal. This had been one of my major goals throughout the day, and I was honestly surprised we got it so quickly. When the announcement was made, the reaction throughout the room was priceless. To everyone – We did not get this from the aliens, we made the technology ourselves. I got a lot of questions about that.\n\nShortly after this, we discovered that the Indians had captured the CEO of one of the Alien “factions”, and the US agreed that we would launch a joint covert operation to rescue him. To the aliens – We were doing this before you told us to. It worked, and I was dragged by control to a conversation with him and the US. We had a meeting, agreed to longer term talks and for a base to be set up in South Africa. We had another conversation on the next turn, they wanted eight people (They were volunteers!) for a level two artifact. I was kinda confused at this. We were way beyond level two artifacts at this point, and eight tokens for it was ludicrously expensive. But, we thought that it was important to establish trade relations at all, what we were really buying was diplomacy. They never contacted us again, which really sucked for the BBC, who we had promised could go to space to talk with the aliens.\n\nThese, by the way, were the “Green” aliens. We had been told there were three factions, green, blue, and purple. The Blue aliens, at this point, were doing a lot with the Chinese and we were told by the Green Alien that they were the scariest ones of all, though the purple ones also needed to be watched.\n\nThis had other consequences as well. The Brazilians and French were upset about being left out of the “trade deal”, so they decided to join the Indo-Russian-Sino trade pact. I talked with the Brazilians later, since we had been so friendly earlier. I wish they’d talked with us before switching, but it was what it was, and we said we’d maintain friendly relations later on. We didn’t talk to the French, because they did some false flag stuff that resulted in ISIS getting a nuke, and were being really shifty all game, especially with the Russians and Chinese.\n\nAt this point, the terror track was continuing to rise, and that was making the UN especially antsy. In response to France’s nuclear problems, they were going to be having a show of their nuclear stockpile to avert concern. The US came to me and said he’d heard that someone was going to detonate one of the nukes. I figured someone else was going to take care of it, but apparently that didn’t happen, and a great deal of fallout was soon a part of the French countryside.\n\nThroughout the game, I’d been getting a number of secret rumors. A fair number of them I felt either weren’t true, or frankly weren’t important enough for me to do anything about. An example of one such rumor was that the US was using slave labor. Around this time, I had received a message on the game’s app ostensibly from Brazil that the US was selling nuclear info the Greens, and I knew this was a lie. Firstly, I was around the US enough that I would have known if they were doing this. Secondly, if the Brazilians wanted to tell me that, they would have done it in person. At this point, we began to disregard all rumors and miscommunication we were getting. Someone in the stars was aggressively trying to sow distrust between the US and the UK, and that flatly failed.\n\nIt didn’t help that we weren’t sure if we were having out of game technical issues, or if we were being ignored by the aliens after a while. After the second meeting, the Aliens stopped trying to contact us, and it appeared as though this may be because the app wasn’t working properly. In the end, I think it was a bit of technical difficulties and the Green aliens having already fleeced the US and not needing anything more, but it was a difficulty.\n\nIt was at this point I was told that the Queen of England had been kidnapped. Shortly thereafter, the Russian Head of State pulled me aside, let me know he had her, and that it was something his deputy had done, going rogue in a meta sense. He was really apologetic, and wanted to mess with some of his team members in return for doing that without his clearance, but the Queen being taken couldn’t be retconned, and I felt I had little choice but to declare war on Russia. I was preparing for a major speech (It had tons of Winston Churchill quotes, it was going to be amazing), but control wanted us to wait for the UN to finish their deliberations that round. While we waited, a lot of people came to me and begged me not to declare war, that it would send us over the terror track, but in my role playing mind, I could not let such an insult to British honor go without response. But enough people came, that I went over and demanded the Queen’s immediate return from the Russians. It was not given. And so, I prepared to declare war.\n\nThen the UN finished their meeting, and said that they’d agreed to unify all the world’s militaries and declare war on the Purple aliens. The UN, which had been largely ineffectual and operating on their own separate diplomacy for the entire game, in one fell swoop robbed us of our sovereignty in order to strike at one alien faction. My fury at my UN representative for robbing me of the opportunity to restore British honor by making the Russians kneel (And not letting me give my speech) was something to behold. We shortly thereafter had a successful raid to take back the Queen from the Russians, and tensions cooled down, but man, things did not take the turn I wanted them to.\n\nThis was around the time I started to get really out of the loop as well. Suddenly I was hearing about UK-US-Brazilian plans to escape Earth (Using one of the UK colony ships), I heard about plans to nuke a moon base and a Mars base that the aliens had, I learned that the Indians had a giant robot, I felt confused about who to point my guns at. As the USA was leaving Earth (With my scientist and the Queen, to keep her safe until she could return), they gave me control of their nuclear weapons, and they gave GNN control of the country. Thus came my favorite news article of the day, “‘The colonies are back in line’ states PM.”\n\nAs the colony ship was escaping, something launched and attached itself to one of the ships (The one the Queen was in) which kept it from launching. It was later revealed this was done by the Japanese, who were upset that they hadn’t been invited, and in the end turned out to be a good thing. When the Chinese launched their Ark into space, the US attempted to shoot it down, which prompted Brazil to take over our colony ships. At least this meant that the Queen wasn’t under Brazilian control.\n\nWe now enter the endgame. When the US escaped into space, they gave us their nuclear codes, so we launched all of the US and UK's nukes at Mars. The aliens had invested a ton in defense there, but that was only against conventional attacks, so we destroyed all of that instantly. It was rather fun to watch as they realized everything was going up in smoke in an instant, all their reinforcements gone to waste. I believe the exchange was “But we have a plus eleven to defense!” “Well, tell them that nukes are plus twelve.” The Indians attacked the Moon with a commando team, but it had already been abandoned. Then we started hitting their bases on Earth one by one, and they kept falling back with each attack, hoping to thin out our forces. Their final base was in Beijing, and the Moderator asked the Chinese how much of their forces would be attacking the base.\n\n\"We will actually be defending it from aggression.\"\n\nSo with the Chinese military and Alien military massed in one spot, India launched nukes and wiped them out in one go. This made me very happy.\n\nAt this point I decided to launch our final two colony ships into space, one of which was carrying the Immortal Queen Elizabeth II. This was a very good decision, because the Aliens then elected to send the entirety of their air force to attack London (I learned afterwards that they were trying to take the Queen, so good call on my part). Both sides took a lot of damage in the fight, but the aliens were driven off in the end. If the final conflict comes down to a massive battle over my capital, I feel confident I did a very good job at being relevant and influential in the game.\n\nWith the epic Battle of London over, with all the nations of the world coming to defend our shining city (Big Ben still stood, per control, though not in great shape!), we had a moment of glory. But we had gone over 250 on the terror track, thus making the efforts of the UN to screw me over having been pointless in the end. Even though the Indian Robot went and tied the parts of the moon back together, the governments of Earth collapsed, and made what was actually a single faction of Aliens, the entire time not have too much trouble as they picked the Earth apart for spare parts. Control said that the Aliens technically won, but that there were a lot of humans that escaped which held a strong grudge. Most of the Chinese ended up enslaved by the Aliens as test subjects with some others escaping on an ark, the Japanese Prime Minister was enslaved by the Chinese on the Ark, the US Government was ruled by the Brazilians, and the UK sent two additional colony ships to start a new glorious empire. We shall return to London one day, to restore it to its former glory.\n\nThe day was a blast, and I’ve skipped a lot of things. The big mysteries I still want to know at this point are what was going on that let the GNN apparently get British artifacts, and how much of the communication troubles with the guy wearing the “Green” aliens was due to technical issues and how much of it was fleecing the US. If you’re ever in the area, check out Maryland Megagames, I can’t recommend this enough.",

        "text": "The planet of Grace has been recently recolonized by the Rogue Trader. With any recolonized planet, there will always be complications, especially with a planet full of cannibals. So, whose job is it going to be to fix the problems that arise?\n\nThe local PDF that is formed. Enter in the poor schmucks who are pulled into this:\n\nCarter: The Sergeant of the Squad. Extremely grumpy. He doesn’t like any of the squad members, some more than most.\n\nLok: The resident psyker. Addicted to the local brew of Grace Gyn. Has flasks on him all the time.\n\nEthen: The squads weapon specialist. A psychopath who names all his guns and grenades. \n\nAdam: The tech-priest assigned to the party. A coward at heart who jumps away from the nearest sight of danger.\n\nThe scene starts up with the party waking up in their barracks, the sound of golf ball sized hail hitting their roof. Carter and Ethen strike up a conversation with the psychopath talking to his lascarbine and stroking it lovingly and receiving a few choice words from the sergeant about what could be considered borderline heresy. Lok sunk deeper into his bed, cradling his bottle of Grace Gyn while Adam moved about and started to boot up his servitor, Twitch (who had the really uncanny flaw of what could be called a nervous twitch). After a few minutes of banter our heroes were brought out and taken to an auditorium with the rest of the PDF of the planet. The governor, who was once a member of the Rogue Trader’s retinue, briefs the entire PDF that they’ll be clearing out ruined mansions in the mountain of the cannibal inhabitants. So with their objective the party gathered up everyone and set out to the mountains.\n\nAfter a few hours of travel and country music being played on the Chimera’s radio. They arrived at the mansion and their first thought was to back up the Chimera into the front doors. After opening the tank they quickly set up to work setting up a make shift barricade. With that set up they fired off the first few rounds to attract the attention of the cannibals.\n\nThus, the horde descended upon them armed with shotguns. Lok jumped up first, using a psychic power to throw various pieces of pillars at them, taking out about five of the cannibals. The cannibals responded in time, with shotgun blasts that nearly killed the psyker. In response Lok dropped to the ground, curled up and pulled out a flask while he started using other powers to help support the others. With lasguns and flamers out the guardsmen slowly chipped away at the horde who would continue to return fire before killing the rest of the cannibal horde. \n\nWith a few wounded Carter uses the vox to establish communication with one of the other squads to see if they had a medic. After some vox-tagging they eventually got in contact with Squad Delta who had the medic. Carter requested that they could send him their way to help with their wounded and was told that they would bring him in about an hour to two hours. As Carter chatted with the other squads the rest of the party gathered up the shotguns and ammo from the cannibals and stored it in a trunk in their chimera.  To kill time Carter order the rest of the squad to move deeper into the mansion.\n\nAs they wandered the halls they found that things weren’t…right with it. The floors and walls had started to turn at an angle as they walked, as if the wood and stone had been shaped that way. After getting lost in the maze-like mansion Adam, with his nerves getting the better of him in this situation, decided that it would be best to turn back and return to the chimera. After somehow navigating the maze he and the party returned to the entrance where the found their Chimera…and something else.\n\nFloating near the chimera was a strange pillar of flesh about 6 feet wide and 7 feet tall with a ball like head that had many eyes upon it and tendrils coming out of the main body. The creature had been rummaging through their chimera. Adam screamed. The creature stared at him. Adam shot the creature with his lascarbine. And then the creature brought up a tendril to reveal a silver barrel within it.\n\nI’ll be wrapping this up with part two later Will the guardsmen survive this horrific monstrosity? Who knows.\n",
