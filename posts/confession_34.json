No one, no matter how hard they tried, could tell me that we were not right for each other. Fast forward a few years. We have a child. A girl. She’s beautiful in every way. I fall in love all over. Two months later, we have another one on the way.! A boy this time. A couple days after the birth, she grows very ill. At this time I’m about 23 and she is 32. We are told that she shouldn’t have any more children. My heart is broken. I become cynical. My heart grows hard and unkind. I become distant and cold. I’m unhappy. Even though I was told our age difference would come to haunt our relationship, I wouldn’t believe it. Fast forward two years later. My unhappiness becomes transparent to all who know me. I start entertaining other women. (Not cheating). Just casually flirting. I do this for months maybe even a year or so. It’s an outlet for me. In this time she gets diagnosed with breast cancer. I tried to be better. I really did. But the thing about cancer is it makes life harder in all aspects. Fast forward some more and she finds messages and locations on my phone and she decides to leave with our two kids. No one could blame her. The really shitty thing is that a couple weeks later she begs to get back together. I say no. This woman with two small children, and cancer. I said no. It was impossible for me to sign up to be unhappy again after I felt like the unhappiness was just gonna be who I was forever. I know I’m the villain In this story. Im not looking for forgiveness or absolution. But somebody in a world of 8 billion has to understand.",

        "text": "I recall hearing tires crunching on the gravel driveway. Pausing my movie, I got up. Bare feet plunking on the wooden stairs, the audible creak from passing the landing. When I’m halfway up the knock permeates the house. Reaching the top of the stairs, I pause, stare at the door knob. Another knock, no time to react. The front door hurls open barely missing my face. Suddenly I’m swarmed by black uniforms embossed with yellow lettering. My brother sits in the living room. His eyes momentarily diverted from a video game before flashing back to it. What goes through his head? I do not know. My own mind swimming in confusion. An officer points to the couch and mumbles something about a search warrant. I take a seat beside my brother. The walls reverberate with footsteps of heavy laden boots, from the kitchen down the stairs to the basement. So much noise. Something falls downstairs, I feel the thud and hear glass breaking. Our cat lets out a deplorable yowl as if in pain. Another set of tires in the driveway, this time my grandma comes barreling up the walkway. Without a word my brother and I are ushered into her car  beginning the 5 minute drive to her house. Halfway there we run into my dad and younger brother, he joins us in the car and my father continues home my himself.\n\nHe was arrested. \n\nI returned to our empty home to grab some belongings and our precious cat. What I came upon startled me. The front door was left ajar, and the house was unsurprisingly chilly. Boot prints littered the floors, and a strong pungent smell hung in the air. In the basement was complete chaos, furniture and knickknacks upturned, papers scattered, the TV smashed and broken, the freezer was unplugged, left open to rot and fester. I cried silently and scooped the cat into my arms. His tail had been stepped on, but thankful not broken. With kitty held to my chest I made my way outside and took him to my mothers.",

        "text": "I used to abuse my younger brother. I was in my early teens, he was around half my age, maybe 6 or 7. I used to hit him a lot. \n\nI remember one instance especially: when it was just my younger brother and I at home, I had paused my game on the family computer and left for the restroom, when I returned my brother was curiously messing around with the computer and somehow he had let my in-game-character die, this enraged me, I grabbed his arm and threw him to the ground, and kept kicking him. I still remember seeing the fear in his eyes when I grabbed him with all my strength. As I was kicking him wherever I could, I heard the front door open, and heard my mother, so I grabbed his arm again pulled him up and while strengthening my grip told him to shut the fuck about this, or I'll do him worse next time. He nodded and wiped his tears. Although infrequent, this kind of abuse occurred until he was in his early teens.\n\nWhen I was in my mid twenties, I told my mother about this. I told her how I used to 'hit' my brother and how I felt remorse. 'Hit' was a euphemism but I didn't have the balls to tell her I used to abuse him. She just said, 'really? I think he loves you very much, you're the only one he listens to'. He would listen to me out of fear, I knew this.\n\nAfter leaving home at 18 I became much softer to my younger brother. I bought him birthday/seasonal gifts and tried to be as supportive as a brother could be. But I have never apologized to him. \n\nI am aware this is just an excuse, but I was abused by my father, and bullied at school for as long as I can remember. It was frequent and harsh, but the domestic abuse was mostly only towards me, which I am now grateful for, I just wish I didn't do the same to my brother. Although I am now physically bigger and stronger than my father, I still fear him, I still wouldn't dare question him. I can't imagine ever getting over this fear, I fear it may be the same case with my brother towards myself. \n\nI saw a dream today, where my little brother and I were both kids again and we were happily playing together as kids would. When I woke up I instinctively knew in the dream was a world where I was never abusive towards my brother, and he genuinely felt safe with me. I remember what I had done to him and the innocence I may have robbed him of, I cried a little and decided I needed to confess to random people online.\n\nCurrently I am in my late twenties, he is now a college student. He is doing well from what I can tell. He is now a tall, muscular, smart, very good looking, gentleman. I am very proud of him. A few months ago, he called me and told me how his college life is going, and of his future dreams, I was elated. I was just happy he telling me about himself. (This is the first and only time since I left home over a decade ago)\n\nTo my brother who will never see this, I am sorry for abusing you. No need to forgive me for what I have done, but please forgive your brother for not having the balls to apologize. I love you champ.\n\nTo anyone who read this to the end: Thank you, I needed this.",

        "text": "Okay, so, I’m going to try to be as brief as possible with my explanation. Giving all the necessary details.\n\nSo, last semester I was living in an apartment while one of my friends was still living in the dorms. He and his girlfriend started coming to my place more and more often until they started technically living with me. I didn’t mind it, I was happy. His girlfriend and I eventually got very close, and that’s where the issues began. I had never been that close to a girl without her being my girlfriend, so I genuinely, and I say this completely honestly did not know.\n\nRegardless, she started being a little more intimate with me, playing with my hair, sleeping on my lap, wanting to sit next me on the coach, she kissed my head that one time, etc. And I honestly thought nothing of it, I did not have any feelings for her so I genuinely thought that this is acceptable behavior. \n\nJust as a note, I always tried to avoid getting anywhere close to her generally. I would be sitting on a chair and they’d be sitting on the couch and I’d be sitting on a chair while watching a movie to avoid doing anything. She then would tell me to sit on the couch to get more comfortable, and her suggestion would be innocent enough but still I’d hesitantly agree.\n\nI have never sexualized her in any way, except that one time. We were watching a movie, they were on the bed, and again I was on a chair, she told me to relax with them, again hesitantly I agreed. We all got pretty tired midway through the movie, her boyfriend got up and left and I was falling asleep by then. A thought popped into my head, but I did dismiss it as it was inappropriate and unethical.\n\nLong story short, her boyfriend asked her if I had feelings for her. She gave him stories that supported his question but lacked enough context. They both started a fight with me and we broke off the friendship. \n\nThis thing has been on my mind for a while now, but what I am struggling with is deciding if I’m a shitty person or not. I might be dumb, but am I a bad person?",

        "text": "Context: I am now 23(afab nonbinary) and my brother is now 21m. Our father passed when I was 10 and he was 8, our father was in the military all of our lives and was deployed twice for long periods at a time, with smaller stints of being sent within the country for weeks to a month in between the two longer deployments. \nHe returned from an 11 month deployment December of 2008 and was planning to leave the military after he returned as he was extraordinarily guilty for missing so much of our childhoods. He was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of unknown cancer due to exposure to dangerous chemicals overseas before I was born. The moment we got our father back we spent the rest of that year watching him die. It is still the only year of my my life that I can vividly remember in its near entirety ( it was severely traumatic). I was very very close to my dad, not that my brother wasn’t, but I was at the age where he could talk about things he saw, learned and experienced and I would understand. \nAfter his death my mother shut down entirely, depression and grief overwhelming her, she was so distant and disconnected that she began to neglect my brother and I in a way that reset me as a person entirely. I immediately took on the responsibility of my brother herding him, hushing him. Trying to keep us out of trouble because the wrath of my mother in this state was something a child should never experience.\nMy mother soon began to solely focus her anger and abuse on me exclusively.  \nMeanwhile she was slowly able to return to my brother as the child she favored and doted on. \nThe journals written by my father feel like the only remnants of the one parent who didn’t view raising me as something that happened to them or a burden they were left with. \nDealing with the years of my mothers abuse while still interacting with her is so incredibly difficult, especially knowing she’s the only living parent I have left. \nMy mother’s favoritism has bled into my ability to trust my brother, and I know it isn’t his fault. He and I have always been close but not without wounding each other unintentionally as we are still products of our environment. I resent him for getting the affection from the only parent we had left, for being too young and being shielded, and being the one fawned over about how much he looks like our dad. There’s this fear that even for a moment sharing the one thing I had that made me feel closest to my father , he will take it and keep it- and everyone around me will tell me that he’s the one that deserves it anyways. \nI know it’s unfair, but I also know that this will never be something that I’m willing to share.\nI have spent so much time searching for other things to feel close to my father, but his writing is the way I feel closest to him, meanwhile all my brother has to do is look into a mirror or walk into a room with family who bubble over with joy that he is so much like our father.",

        "text": "Hello, I am 24 years old and I am carrying a big amount of guilt over some of my past actions and I dont know how to overcome it. I feel like telling it here and knowing what people think may help me. I will try to keep it short and tell the most important details:\n\n1. Sent an unsolicited dick pic.\n5 years ago I matched with a girl on a dating app, we talked, we moved to instagram, I told her I was looking for a FWB, she said she would think about it, after some more messages I sent a nude and of course she got angry and we stopped talking.\n\nTwo years later I started feeling a lot of guilt and I searched for her instagram for days trying to find her. When I did, I apologized to her with a relatively big text and she said it was lovely that I did that. I still feel guilt that I did that.\n\n2. Convinced(?) a FWB to give me a HJ (2 years ago)\n\nI had a friend with whom I had a fwb arrangement more or less, she was very shy about it. Through text she would always tell me how much she wanted to give me a HJ (starting slow), she seemed totally ready for it.\nBut when it came to the moment (in bed, already ready) she wanted to do it but it seemed like she didnt have the courage to do it and would say no.\n\nBut then I tried to convince her, telling her she could try it, she cant do anything wrong and that when she did it, she would find it easier next time. I tried a couple times and she then did it, but afterwards I felt very bad because she said no and I should have just waited until she was ready instead of trying to convince her.\n\nI thought it wasnt so bad because we already talked about being fwb and she told me multiple times she wanted to give me a HJ but if she wasnt ready, I should have not tried to convince her.\n\nWhen I talked to her about it, she said that what I did was kind of in the limit but not as bad as I think it is, and she even laughed and said that I am totally overthinking it and everything is okay, but I still feel bad because I thought with my dick convincing her so I could get a handjob instead of just backing out and letting her do it when she was 100% ready.\n\n3. Hired an escort (1 year ago) to see how the experience would be like (In germany, where its legal)\n\nNever had much of a problem dating, but I never felt satisfied and was curious about how it would be to have a night with a sex worker.\nShe was a woman in her 40s, good looking and very friendly. We had a good time, had good conversation, were in bed, then had more conversation afterwards and that was it but then I felt very bad because I felt that I crossed a line. I also didnt think about this before, but now what makes me feel the worst is thinking that a future partner might see this as a deal breaker and not want to know me because I tried this.\n\nIn summary, I feel like I have crossed a line several times when it comes to sexual stuff and after the experience with the sex worker, the two other things have been constantly in my mind, giving me tremendous guilt. \n\nI even have a hard time enjoying sex now because I feel as if I dont deserve to enjoy it. Sometimes when someone talks about a rapist and horrible stuff like this, my mind tells me things like \"well, I am not better\". This really starting to take a hit on my mental health even though I myself know its absurd to compare my actions to that of a rapist or something..",

        "text": "PREFACE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies for the extremely long and detailed post but I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest as a form of catharsis, as I’ve been keeping this to myself for well over a month now. So here goes…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE START (OF SOMETHING NEW)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI switched jobs in late 2019 for career advancement purposes and met this guy at my new workplace. He had actually started one week before I did, so we instantly connected, both being new hires. I thought nothing special of him at first - sure, he was physically attractive, but I’m not one to fall for appearances alone. Plus, he was out of my league. We began to work a lot together, go out for lunch/coffee, and talk about work outside of work. There was a sense of connection and trust between us that even others in the office began to take notice. This all happened over the course of 4-5 weeks; he soon left the company because his contract ended (he was hired as a freelancer) and declined a full-time offer with this same company. I was devastated, as he was my only close friend at work, but I also came to realize that I had developed feelings for him. I mean, he was just my type, personality-wise: funny, witty, knowledgeable, experienced, great verbal communicator, and (at that moment in time) nice. Little did I know my perception of him would change years later. Anyway, we continued to stay in touch after his departure, primarily via text and even went out for coffee and dinner some weeks later. It was after this encounter that I confessed my feelings to him but he friend-zoned me. I was pretty embarrassed and told him to just forget I ever brought the topic up, pretend it never happened, which he agreed to (he was really cool about it). We continued to text and a few weeks later I leave my job (voluntarily, 2 months before the global pandemic happened - yikes!) and we catch up that same day for drinks and to chat about me leaving my job. Amidst food and drinks, he brings up the topic (re: my feelings), when I clearly told him not to - he asked if I still had feelings for him and said that he could’ve taken advantage of me. I lied and said that it was just infatuation and that I’d moved on to someone else now. The whole taking advantage of me comment threw me off and I was uncertain if he was just joking or he meant it seriously. A month passed and we met again to job hunt together. I even offered to review his resume and LinkedIn profile and would send him job postings I thought he’d be a good fit for. Then the pandemic happened but we continued to keep in touch via text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE TRANSITION (TO SOMETHING MORE)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that year, we meet again in person, for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Seeing him again was both thrilling and miserable at the same time; my feelings for him were still there and just as strong, if not stronger. We have some drinks and dinner and then go our separate ways. Back home, we start texting and he asks if I want to have sex. This was unexpected, although a part of me did see this coming. I asked him if he was drunk and he responds with, “no, you are. Because you don’t know what you want and talk in code.” Mind you, I only had one drink and was very well aware of what was going on. I ask, “so you’d take advantage of me?” He avoids answering the question and responds with, “Jesus Christ \\[my name\\]. Either you tell me what you want or drop the subject. Is that what you want?” I say, “nothing. I still have feelings for you.” He then proceeds to say we can have a NSA/FWB situationship. I feel disappointed and confused by all of this, so I leave him hanging until the following day. I follow up with, “Wow, how did we go from talking about feelings to sex? I can't even tell if you're serious or not at this point. For the record, I didn't want sex, I just wanted your company,” to which he responds with, “I know what you wanted. That's why I told you I'm ok with NSA. I'm not at a point where I'd want to get involved with someone emotionally.” After much back and forth and a thorough interrogation of all of this, I told him that I was willing to test the waters but would end it if it went too far. Biggest mistake of my life - I was still a virgin (I was a late bloomer but I also had major trust issues), hence why I hesitated on accepting this. However, I really liked this guy and genuinely trusted him (at the time) and felt comfortable enough around him to lose my virginity to him. After losing my virginity, we continued to text and meet at his place 1-2 times per month (he was 1.5 hours away and we both had busy work/social lives). This went on for 2 years. It wasn’t long before I started seeing his true colors - dark and grey, and black and blue. Soon enough, he began to change - he stopped being as responsive to my texts, he would be bossy and yell at me, be aggressive and controlling, cold and distant. He was already emotionally unavailable to begin with but now it was even worse. Despite all this, I still loved him and a part of me was afraid to lose him, although I knew deep down it would happen eventually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE END (OF WHAT WAS).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to three months ago. We meet at his place in early November; this would be the last time I’d see him in person. He tells me that he’s going away on vacation to his home country for 10 days for Thanksgiving. The following week, he reaches out to me and asks if I can meet him at his place. I decline because I was swamped with work that day. Thanksgiving comes and goes and he reaches out to check in with me. I had assumed he was no longer interested since he had been less and less responsive but he assured me that he’d let me know when he can see me. Days pass by and I don’t hear back from him. I decide to look up his social media profile and, to my dismay, I find that his status has changed to “in a \\[long distance\\] relationship.” I was devastated, broken, hurt, angry, but not surprised. I immediately look up his girlfriend’s social media profile - sure enough, she’s physically attractive, young and fit, with over 4K+ followers, including him. There’s no way I could compete, no way I could compare. I resist the urge to reach out to him, to confront him about this. Days pass and I’m unable to sleep, unable to focus, unable to hold back tears. New Year’s rolls around and we text each other new year wishes. I ask him if he’s still down to meet and he responds with “Going through some stuff right now. We’ll stay in touch!” Of course I knew exactly what kind of stuff he was going through but I held off on confronting him about it. Two weeks pass and I can no longer hold back. I reach out to his girlfriend directly via social media to let her know about my situationship with him. Oh, but I don’t stop there. I also let her know about his dark side, the side she’s never seen because all he’s shown her is his good side, the side he wants the world to see. She had a hard time believing me at first, but after showing her all the evidence I collected (including texts and screenshots/pictures), she chose to believe me and blocked him immediately. We then talked some more - she told me that she only just met him in November, while he was visiting abroad/his home country for 10 days. They connected via social media, went out on a date, and next thing you know, they have unprotected sex and are in a relationship. He told her that he wants to marry her (after she graduates from school, she’s 10 years younger than him), be the father of her children, and bring her to America legally via marriage. He told her not to worry, that he will work to take care of her financially. Did I mention that this all happened over the course of 10 days abroad? Meanwhile, I reach out to him to confront him about all this, to which he responds “You’re crazy Jesus Christ what is wrong with you. I haven’t told you to come over since way before my trip to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, which is where we met. I don’t owe you shit, I never did. Don’t you fucking write to me ever again you stalking psycho.” This infuriated me so much that I called him out on all his B.S. and how he’s treated me all this time, that even though we were never official, he had no right to treat me like shit and I had the right to know if he was sleeping with others (for obvious health reasons). He then claimed that I was a liar and that he was not my first, that I was never a virgin. I held my stance and finally told him I was done. I cried alone the rest of that day. The following day, his girlfriend reached out to me via social media to tell me that he created a fake social account to get in touch with her and tell his side of the story. I told her it’s fine, she can have him, I want absolutely nothing to do with him. I did try to warn her about him though, as I thought the whole situation between him and her seemed fishy (love-bombing?) and let the matter go, deleting the fake social account I had used to reach out to her anonymously. Later that day, I received a text from him, apologizing for how he handled the situation and that he should have told me he had started a relationship. I didn’t know what to say or feel, I was still hurt by his reaction, hurt by his words; I doubted his sincerity. He then blocked my number and blocked me from all social platforms, including LinkedIn. This hurt me even more so I proceeded to block him on Venmo, although I never had the heart to block his number. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt’s only been over a month but it’s felt like an eternity. There are good days and bad days, days when I’m well and days when I can’t stop crying. Last I heard, they’re back together again and he went off to visit her last week for Valentine’s Day. He’s also open to work, which to me sounds like his company had some layoffs, him included. Karma, I suppose? As for me, I’ve come to accept my new reality. I don’t regret what happened between us but I do regret how I ended things; I should have confronted him first as opposed to reaching out to his girlfriend. Looking back, there were a lot of red flags I missed. Although I was well aware of what I was getting into, I didn’t think it would end the way it did and hurt as much as it does now. What hurts me most is that I gave my all (my time, my life, my body) to a person I sincerely trusted and thought to be, above all, my friend. But he took my friendship for granted, opting for someone he met over the course of 10 days vs someone he got to know over 3 years. And yet, I wish him well. Perhaps one day I’ll be able to forgive, but I know I won’t forget. But for now, I’ll take things slowly, one step at a time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - 1 year friendship with guy turns to 2 year FWB/NSA situationship. I lose my virginity to him and grow attached. He leaves me for a girl he meets abroad, while on vacation for 10 days.",

        "text": " \n\nI had just turned 16 and managed to get into a local pub with some of my friends from band practice. I basically hid in the corner of the pub and they were buying me drinks all night. Obvs I was pretty drunk and was mingling with others in the pub, especially with these two older guys who legit wouldn't leave me alone and kept hitting on me all night. And I'll be honest, I liked it.\n\nThey eventually invited me to an afterparty which I agreed to, so we left and headed to one their houses. It was walking distance so the 3 of us walked. There was alot of cuddles, flirting and sexual talk going on which I went along with.\n\nOne of the men went to pee behind a shop and whilst me and the other man waited, we ended up snogging. I'll be honest, there was something about the whole situation which made me horny af.\n\nAnyways, we end up making it back to this afterparty. No party was there, it was legit just us 3! I didn't mind too much, I was having a great night anyways.\n\nThings of course escalated, it was my first one night stand, let alone threesome. There was something dangerously romantic about letting these two much older strangers use me the way they did but I let it happen.\n\nAnyways, now to the regret part.\n\nFast forward to 19 and I meet and fall head over heels for the perfect boy. I mean I was in love with him. However, we go public on Facebook and a month or so later, I get a message from one of the men from that night. He knows my now boyfriend. Not only does he know him, but he is his fucking divorced uncle!\n\nMy bf ended up finding out (I told him as the guilt ate me up inside) and he went mental and couldn't take it. We ended up splitting soon after. I lost the boy of my dreams because of a dumb drunken one night stand.",

        "text": "In fact I am asking myself questions. \nI am 24, I am a an international student in a state university in Texas. \n\nI am doing a graduate program currently. It is a program I chose...out of spite. \nSo if I have to be more precise, I would say that I transfered to a university in Arkansas(from my home country) during my undergraduate years. In the end I had a GPA below 3.5(3.2) and If I want to continue for the Master I had to take the GMAT. Unsure about the results I could have and with the restrictions international student( I had 1 month to either leave the country or continue for Ms), I end up in the university where I am currently. I am doing a graduate degree that I am regretting already because I don't see any future in it. I don't know if there are people in my boat but I have never ever had an internship in my job. I did some jobs on campus left and right but that's it. I applied recently for position as teacher assistant and after acing all the interviews and rounds, I end up not being selected(Why ? Because apparently the fact I will graduate in less than 6 months is not what they are looking for. Not mad just tired that even when I qualify for a job, I still get eliminated on details).\n\nI regret not picking a degree in stem, I regret being unaware and unprepared before coming to the US, I regret, I regret thinking coming studying in the US was \"an end in itself\". I regret also not being a genius. \n\n\n\nI am asking myself if...I improved ?\nThat's the question in my mind so far. \nI am 24 and I feel like I have the wrong concerns many times. I still have this mindset to buy things just to brag about it, like I want to impress \"Eh look, I am doing better than you guys🤦🏻‍♂️\" . \nI still want to impress people I hate knowing their validation will lead me nowhere. That's kind of the result of trauma in high school. I don't know if I will overcome it. \nBut I am doing my best to not fall into this need to impress my former classmates in highschool. I spend less and less time on social media and I think that's for the best. \n\nOn the other hand I am asking myself questions. I am 24. I have never been in relationship. I don't approach women at all and I generally imagine scenarios where women reject me frequently. At least I don't embarass myself. But it leads to another concern: most men my age are already in a serious relationship or married. Which I doubt will be my case. I don't want to be a relationship at all cost. But at the same time, I feel like I am missing out on something. I have a childhood friend who got married recently. Surprised but at the same time, I start to ask myself if I am not a man child in the end. Being married means she is stable financially and has a good situation allowing her to do so. And she is already doing that at 24(we have the same age), meanwhile I can't even go a month without begging for the parents to send me money. I am happy for her but It pushes me to reflect on my situation and understand that I am maybe a...failure ??? I didn't really grow in the end. My main needs are even a symptom of that: \nWatching anime, playing video games, watching soccer, play soccer with people. Like I am 24. I am fucking old in 6 years I will be a thirtysomething. And I still have these kind of interests. I am more preoccupied by EA making an update on fifa than politics. Like it doesn't even match. I should be thinking about how organizing my retirement and working toward it and instead I am still doing what I was doing already 5 even 7 years ago. \nI didn't grow up, mentally,spiritually,emotionally and even professionally at all. I think seriously that if I don't make it by 27-28, then maybe I am living for nothing. \n\nThat's not a pity party. That's just an objective and cold look on the situation.",
