I like watching his videos because it’s so obvious he’s massively insecure and overcompensating and it’s obvious he’s an idiot but how did he make all his money? How long has he been in jail? What’s with the whole pizza thing? Can anybody explain it to me in depth or give me a timeline of it all? Also how does anybody buy what he’s saying at all? Like how has he gathered so many loyal followers when it’s so obvious he’s a doofus? Do you think it’s all an act and he’s actually a relatively normal guy in real life just trying to get famous by being  entertainingly arrogant? I’m fascinated by it all.

Did anyone ever ask Taylor swift about bart baker in any interviews or whatever? Also can someone explain how/why he transitioned from parodies to the Chinese internet?\n\nI understand YouTube is not such a forgiving platform anymore but filthy frank left to become joji and we can see how he still kept making content he wanted to albeit for a different audience. We all know how leafy tried to keep his clickbaity videos going in 2020 and he got banned for not maintaining the YouTube standards. But Bart baker's content wasn't anything YouTube wouldn't like. Sure they were a little offensive to singers but not to other YouTubers or whatever. He also looked like he enjoyed making the content he made, why did he stop? Is there any way who can bring him back or someone else who replaced him as a parody god?\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Baker",
