I used to be really into cyber security and computers in general but after five years of failing to learn to code and generally feeling really really dumb thanks to my under developed skills in math and my inability to make those up in under a year, I have lost a lot of confidence in myself. I have also lost a lot of motivation when I learned that it doesn't matter what you know, how many CTFs you do, or how many books and courses you read and watch and study. One dude with a $60k piece of paper who did as much studying as you did, will get interviews 100% of the time. No one cares what you know. Just where you learned how to know. End of story. \n\nLike most people I can't afford college, I know that if I go theres a high chance that I will flunk out of it because I can only do math at about an eight grade level at best. I look at a lot of the math done in a CS degree and I can't comprehend it no matter how hard I try. I have fine connections in several tech mega corps but all of them tell me to get a bachelors degree at least to even be considered. I've basically halted all efforts to keep learning because I know that it do anything besides create a liability in my life since it won't make me any money and I am disadvantaged because I am lacking *something* that a lot of dudes in this field have. I had a plan to go into system administration then after a few years go into pentesting but you need a bachelors degree for that. \n\nWhat would be the best course of action here?

        "text": "I primarily have a network/system admin background. This is my first job in a security specific role, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I'll be brief:\n\n- We provide cybersecurity to over 100 customers, but there's only 6 analysts.\n\n- Only 2 members of the team are US based. Those two US members do not work at the same time.\n\n- Foreign employees are not inherently a problem, but customers have complained that emails from our employees abroad read like spam mail. The language barrier also impedes our ability to communicate with each other and our customers.\n\n- Two of our analysts are just ticket pushers, but we still call them analysts. So really we only have 4 analysts.\n\n- There's not SOC tiers that we can escalate to. Just us 6, and there's only two working at any one time. And our boss, but he's unreliable.\n\n- Our SIEM only ingests information that's in a static format, by that I mean syslog and windows events. So no ipfix, pcap, nothing. Just the standard syslog and windows events.\n\n- Our SIEM only ingests logs from the devices that our customers set up to forward logs. I can never find a complete picture during an investigation, only like the picture frame.\n\n- 95% of our rules are based on threat intel. If there's suspicious traffic, we won't do anything about it because the 'IP is clean'.\n\n- We only use one source for our threat intel. If it shows up with no reputation there, we stop investigating.\n\n- Many of our correlation rules aren't really correlating anything. They take a single event and generate a case. I.e. a SonicWall generates an event with an Apache Struts exploit signature. We report that with no other supporting evidence. Many customers come back and say things like 'We don't use Apache, why are you sending us this?'\n\n- The other 5% use Windows events, and it's only for failed logins i.e. Windows Security Events 4624 &amp; 4625. There's no other implementation of our rules involving other Windows events, and in no other way than by measuring a certain number of failed logins in a specified period of time.\n\n- Our SIEM is abysmal at normalizing logs. It doesn't parse logs completely; it incorrectly parses; or it doesn't parse at all. Windows events essentially go unparsed. About half of the fields we parse out are different depending on what device is being parsed, so Device A might be parsed as like \"Character 7: DOMAIN/USER\", but Device B will be \"User: DOMAIN/USER\".\n\n- Speaking of parsing, we don't normalize logs for every device we ingest. But we tell customers we do. A handful of our customers have no device logs being normalized, so we never send them anything because nothing gets correlated. I asked my boss about it, and he said \"They don't pay enough money to justify creating a new parser for their device.\" Actually there's a few things the sales pitch and demos involve that we straight up don't do.\n\n- Our incident handling guides for customers are all essentially the same regardless of the incident and basically say \"Block IP at the firewall, scan machine for malware\".\n\n- My boss: very nice guy and I like him, but I think he just watches 'Cybersecurity Webinars' all day. He doesn't assign projects, get involved with rule creation and event correlation, or do anything. The only emails he sends out are links to articles saying 'Hey team you should read this, it's good information.\"\n\n- I recently sent an email to our SIEM support asking about something that should have been very easy to answer concerning regex and what syntax the SIEM recognizes when querying logs. This question had to go all the way to the company CTO to get an answer. The answer was ridiculous: our SIEM uses one syntax of regex but our log database uses another, so only use a syntax that both systems recognize. Lol.\n\n- Our support team frequently doesn't respond to emails or just lets an open case sit there, so issues with the SIEM go unfixed.\n\n- Our SIEM engine frequently gets backlogged or quits working because as stated earlier we have 100+ customers but only one engine set up to normalize and correlate events. There's no load balancing or high availability. If the correlation engine goes down, the logs just get lost in cyberspace or something. This is also related to regex: I've crashed the correlation engine because it couldn't handle a query I ran on the log database.\n\n- I've tried to promote change regarding our rules (especially shifting away from threat intel reliance) and how we correlate events, but it gets shot down. The reasoning: we don't want complicated rules, and we don't want too many rules. When I asked why, the answer was \"We are only equipped to do the basics.\"\n\n- There's no professional development i.e. I don't get the opportunity to go to seminars or take courses. Those have to be self-funded on my own time.\n\n- There's more, but this gives a pretty good picture.\n\nOkay so I didn't keep it that brief. I'm sorry. I only plan to do a couple more months so I can put on my resume that I worked there for a year.\n\nedit: here's another good one: At the beginning of the year the company C-suite personnel had their big meeting for discussing how the company is moving forward. My boss was telling me about it and how they plan to double our customer base in 2018. I asked about the roadmap for internal growth i.e. hiring more analysts, more support, more resources, etc. He said we're fine as is and there's no plans.\n\nedit2: we use our own in-house SIEM solution as opposed to licensing from another provider such as AlienVault. We also license our SIEM to other organizations, and I'm pretty sure our support team is outsourced and not an actual department within our company.",

I've done plenty of Security Analyst and Pentester interviews in the past, but none for Network Security Engineer.\n\nI've spent the past week or so looking for gaps in my knowledge that I can fix, such as network monitoring tools and protocols, but there are still some requirements that I can't learn.\n\nObviously, I don't have three years of experience in an NOC environment since I'm still a student, and I don't have any practical experience with any vendors (Cisco, Checkpoint, etc.).

Just a few examples for analysts.\n\n1. Long hours. 12 hour shifts, sometimes work 40-50 hours. \n2. Working night shifts/morning shifts. This one has always confused me. Working a night shift in a major city like LA or San Fran has to have a high turnover rate. Why bother paying the huge CoL of these cities when you can't even experience them? \n3. Subpar pay. I've seen Seattle/Portland analyst jobs paying 40-50k, 12 hour shifts, night. Denver/Springs with lower 50s asking for night shifts and potentially long hours. So many analyst I've met talk about how much of their social lives they give up. \n\nWould you say these working conditions are pretty much expected for entry level?

I came across a page of a guy that had written a lot of technical details about how he was able to do it, but it's all stuff that's way out of the ballpark of my understanding. \n\nAnyways, I noticed that his camera was using the IP 192.241.x.x so I decided to run AngryIP scanner on every IP on my home network from 192.241.0.1-192.241.255.255.\n\nOut of 65,000 or so hosts scanned, 17000 were ACTIVE. Under hostnames there were thousands of URLs that I don't recognize and have never visited. Many of them pointed to working websites around the country. \n\nAs someone that never ventures out of the 192.168.0.xxx range for setting up the PS4, or my 3d printer Raspberry PI, this seems strange to me. I suppose don't much understanding of how home networks should work, but I'd like to know more. \n\nWhat are these IPs doing? What are they \"pointing\" at? How are they used? Where can I learn more? \n\nWas I doing an IP scan of the internet and just pulling in external IP addresses?",

I am using a 139(numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase) character password plus a keyfile that is not stored on the cloud to secure my database. I turned up the iterations to 20000000 on AES-KDF. With these security measures if someone was to hack my cloud provider would my password database still be secure? On a secondary note all my accounts are set to an encrypted protonmail (have it set to where it is impossible to reset the password on this email) to lower the chance of my email being hacked. Is this a good security practice?",
