        "text": "We handle a lot of patient claims that need to go to insurance for procedure approval. A lot of times we include photographs of the afflicted area because a picture is worth a thousand words to prove a problem and all that. When a new patient is coming in, many times we try and get photo document from their current state, and then get new photos to show progression at their first appointment, typically in 2-3 weeks. \n\n\nI took a call today from a lady who was apparently brand new, trying to get an appointment with our office. She read about our process on our website and read about our photo policy for insurance patients. She called the office today and instead of saying \"hello\" like a normal human, she kicks off the conversation with:\n\n\"Hey! I been texting my photos to your numba for two days and haven't got no response!\"\n\n My brain tried to connect those dots... we don't provide a number to text... we tell patients to call to make an appointment and then we provide them with a secure email address to send their photos.\n \nMe: \"Well ma'am, what number did you text?\" \n\nHer: \"This numba I'm callin' now! When is my appointment?!\" \n\nMe: \"This is the office phone number... it cannot receive text messages. Let me give you the email address for the ph-\" \n\n\"Well, I am driving right now! Can I give you a cell numba and you call me and leave me a voicemail with the email?\" \n\n*pause* \n\nMe: \"No ma'am... how about you call me back when you can write it down?\" \n\nShe sighs loudly because I have obviously suggested something super unreasonable. \n\n\"Okay, lemme just pull ova.\" \n\nShe then proceeds to set the phone down and I hear weird noises for a solid two minutes until she picks up again and says \"A'ight, I'm at a QT. Tell me the email.\" \n\nTl;dr: a lady was trying to text semi-explicit body photos blindly to our office phone number and didn't realize why that couldn't get her an appointment with us",

        "text": "My post the other day reminded me of this one.\n\nI'm a phlebotomist at a medium-sized city hospital. The patients are weird and the shenanigans are constant.\n\nMostly our patient population is poor and/or old people. Naturally, when you're in the hospital you're not looking your best anyway, so when we get a patient who is good-looking and nice, we usually tell the rest of the team and try to 'share' the patient with each other. Nothing creepy, but it's nice to rest your eyes from grumpy old men once in a while. A phenomenon I've noticed, though, is hospital goggles- similar to beer goggles, once you see so many wrinkly old people, a person who would be ok out in the real world becomes 'oh my god did you see the guy in room 322 because DAMN.'\n\nSo my coworker [Mary from my last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfrommedicine/comments/5y7ki7/whats_in_a_name/) (black lady, super sweet) went into 489 and ooooh man this guy was *hot*. She was telling another phlebotomist, LaQuisha, all about him- the perfect 6-pack, the fantastic looks, just whew go draw this man's blood and politely check him out.\n\nI somehow missed the heads up. We were all working together, so I just drew blood, until I went into, did my thing, and then came out of, room 489.\n\nLaQuisha asked me, \"So, what do you think?\"\n\n\"Well I think he's a Nazi\"\n\n\"Wait what?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I thought that was hot guy?\"\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nWe called Mary over and asked her what was up. Yes, this guy was definitely the one she was talking about. \"So there's something wrong with him?\" she asked me.\n\n\"Well yes, Mary, he has a tattoo that says HEIL HITLER bordered with swastikas on the one arm, and a giant fucking swastika on the other arm. And he looks like a methhead. But other than that...\"\n\n\"...oh. But did you see those abs? I was distracted!\"\n\n\"Mary. That was a giant scar from some sort of abdominal surgery, on top of a potbelly.\"\n\nAnd that's how Mary came to work the next day with a new glasses prescription (to replace her actual hospital goggles). We still tease her about her forbidden love for methy Nazis.",

Hope it's understandable.\n\nThis happened 20 years ago when I worked in a dentist's office/oral surgery as a dentist's assistant.\n\nOnce a month we used to treat patients under complete anesthesia (?not sure if that's the right term).   \nThose patients were either afraid of dentist procedures in general or an oral surgery that needed to be performed. Some of those were also kids.\n\nAt one of those days there was this kid, 5 or 6 years. The father brought that child in the treatment room and on the treatment chair. Parents were always asked to stay in the room until the child is asleep to keep them calm. Some also stayed througout the procedure. But that was up to them.\n\nSo the anesthesist and his assistents start their work, put the mask on and the child dozes of. They get breathing tubes and other things out and then we notice the father is getting wobbly. Happened every now and then.\n\nMy boss, the dentist, guides him over to the treatment table so he can lie down. The guy just collapses on it and is out. \n\nWe lift his feet up to get the blood flow going again and that moment the mother, who had been staying with the other kids in the waiting area, comes in because she heard something going on.\n\nShe sees what's happening and then the weird thing...gets all exited, starts laughing and says she needs to get her camera to take a picture of this.\n\nNow this may seem more normal nowadays with everyone filming everything on their smartphones but 20 years ago we were all just \"wtf???\"\n\nMy boss tells her that this would be inapropriate and to go back to the waiting room and make sure the other kids are calm. \n\nThe father woke up shortly after and we rolled him over to the recovery room.\n\nOnce the child was done the mother stayed with the child in the recovery room. We didn't want the father to collapse again.\n\nIt was the weirdest encounter during the whole time I worked there. Although maybe not to strange by todays standards anymore.\n\n\n",

This new patient (who is 20 minutes late to her appointment and refuses to take her sunglasses off when she walks in) comes to my desk to check in. I give her the new patient clipboard and explain the forms. I set a black and gold office pen on top of the clipboard. She grabs it, then looks down and sees the pen on top of the sign in area. She proceeds to pick up that pen too, turn on her heel and go sit down. I watch her open her purse, drop BOTH black and gold office pens into her purse, pull out a completely different pen- and start filling out the forms. What. After a few minutes she brings her paperwork back to my desk, drops it down and walks off. No mention of the pens, doesn't return them. Um. Okay.... did I just get robbed? Yes. Yes I did. \n\n\nLater, I asked my office manager what I should've done. Should I have asked for them back?

        "text": "So I'm a surgeon's assistant (I seem to always start this way). I've worked at a bunch of places all over (done some temp travel work). \n\nAnyway, in the operating room things can get surprisingly casual. There of course is a command hierarchy, but rarely do I call surgeons Dr. (enter name here). I often times call them by their first name. There are still plenty of people who hold to the old ways of heightened respect, but I'm kind of a jerk.\n\nAnyway, that's not the point of this story. I was working on the east coast at a pretty big hospital. It was relatively early in my career, competent, but not confident. I was assigned an ortho case. A patient needed a plate on their distal humerus. And the doctor for the case was a big deal. Very well respected doctor, at the pinnacle of his status, a real world class man. And also one of the most angry and impatient people i've ever met. So i was kind of nervous going into this thing.\n\nWe put the patient to sleep, and clean the site, drape the patient, all without incident (it's the easy part, but when you're nervous you'll mess anything up). One of the things I do to break the ice is make small talk. So I am talking with the nurse to play things off like i'm not nervous (something I've got a bit of a talent for) and I'm waiting for the doctor to take initial x rays, all the while I'm holding the scalpel in my hand. Now I tend to gesticulate when i talk... you see where this is going.\n\nI remember what i was talking about, my girlfriend  at the time had text broken up with me, and while the doctor was putting traction on the patient's arm for a better image, i was making a \"what's the deal with that?\" kind of gesture, and i stabbed him hard on the back side of his arm, right above his elbow.\n\nyou want to talk fear? have a man 5 inches taller, and 50ish pounds more than you, with years of legal experience (all doctors have it) all the resources in the world, and a fat contract with the hospital that was totally take his side in any contest SCREAMING at you. The deluge of vulgarities that flew out at me was a thing of legend. People down the hall heard, but were afraid to come see, they all knew the voice. \n\nWe had just converted to disposable paper gowns, and they had a habit of tearing off in strips if you pulled too hard, and I have a memory of him screaming FUUUUUUCK, as he's pulling strips of his gown off. I saw my career ending before my eyes. \n\nSee, he was afraid i'd severed his ulnar nerve, which would have rendered him inept as a surgeon. It didn't help that it was his dominant hand as well. My god what a terrible few minutes.\n\nAnd so, there's a little thing about life in an operating room that isn't appreciated in stories and film. and it's that in moments like this, it's easy to forget that there's still a patient in need, asleep, paying for anesthesia, and waiting for care. And that patient WILL receive care. So after the doctor washed his wound, and determined I didnt sever his ulnar nerve, came back into the room. We did one of the quietest surgeries ever performed that day. I spent 2 hours within arms reach of a terrifying, incredibly angry man. I tell you what, I did a hell of a job on the rest of that case, cause I'm not sure if I'd have survived a second mistake.\nSo that's made social interactions since then a lot easier.... cause they don't get much worse than that.\n\nEvery now and again, when the newer people get to talking about stories they know, that one comes up, it makes me laugh now. But dude... I almost ended the illustrious career of an amazing surgeon. Which is something that people often lose sight of. In medicine, no matter how mundane a thing you're doing, it can have dire consequences for someone else. You need to be sharp, and deliberate at all times, cause that one time you're not paying attention, that's when you make a mistake. Whether it's entering info into a chart, signing off on orders, counting out meds, or handing a surgeon a knife for the ten thousandth time... the potential for disaster is always there. \n\n\nThat got unintentionally heavy. Sorry, I swear that sounds worse than my actual philosophy.",

It was of the one-armed variety, and probably satisfied neither of us.\n\n…\n\nTheir mother’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis was not news, but only on Christmas Day do all (four) of mom’s grown children and their father get together in a cramped emergency room because mom had a seizure. I had a strong feeling that any other day of the year, Dad surely would have been on his own.\n\nThe baby birds regressed immediately. Three women over forty, both prefacing and following each hurried phrase with their term of endearment—*\"Momma, Why don't we put these socks on your feet, Momma?\"*—grasping without understanding that quiet, slow demonstrations were vastly preferable to their bewildered matriarch. Her bladder, like many approaching their ninth decade, was very active, but moving her to the bathroom ten feet away was not a task her daughters were equipped to handle, and an endless barrage of rhetorical questions confused the postictal woman even further.\n\nWe did everything that an efficient emergency department should to rule out emergence or progression of various maladies, and in the end, only Alzheimer’s and a previously diagnosed seizure disorder remained.\n\nThe doctor printed discharge paperwork while I loaded Momma into a wheelchair. I’m afraid the efficiency of calmly placing limbs on the arms of the peoplemover went unnoticed by the entire hurried clan while they got their own coats, save for Dad’s silent nod. \n\nHis tired eyes told me he looked forward to tomorrow night, and a quiet evening with his bride.",

Life got a little crazy there for a bit.\n\nANYWAYS, I work in the Operating Room at a trauma facility, and I see a LOT. \n\nSo, I've got this belief that everyone has a natural talent for at least one thing. Some people have amazing hand eye, some people read eyes amazingly well, some have amazing penmanship. Some people never find out what theirs is. You get the idea.\n\nAnyways my talent is that I have an uncanny ability to kill flies with my bare hands. It's much easier when they've landed, but I can kill them pretty successfully in flight too. I've killed two flies with one slap before. I mean... I've killed a stupid number of flies. \n\nWell, as you can imagine a fly in the operating room is a pretty serious matter. There's bug zappers at every entrance. Sometimes they still get in. You can imagine how delicious an operating room must smell to a fly. Flies of course are filthy. The risk of infection increases dramatically from anything they land on. Another issue with them is that it's extremely difficult to keep track of what they've landed on, and once one has been discovered in a room it's safe to assume that anything could be contaminated. \n\nIt's hard to imagine a situation where having a talent for splatting bugs with your bare hands could actually save a life. But I've found one. \n\nThe hard part about my talent... no one believes that I can do it. \n\nSo I kind of lost my way with this story, but the lesson is, everyone has a talent, it's just a matter of finding it, and finding an a way to apply it.",

Twelve stays in 2016. Already been in this year. Frequent. \n\nOne day last summer my day nurse was someone new to me, a fairly young guy. No biggie. He came in, set up my IV antibiotics and walked out. Turns out he forgot to hook it to me. Now there's a growing puddle. \n\nI hit the nurse light, he comes. I showed him the issue, he hooks it up to me then gets paper towels and starts wiping up the mess. \n\nSuddenly I feel a grab on my thigh. He reached over the bed railing and halfway across the bed and grabbed my very upper thigh pretty tightly. \n\nI expected a flustered apology or something, but no he just looks straight at me then let's go and walks out. \n\nIt completely freaked me out. My husband came in about 2 hours later and I told him. I was afraid I was over reacting (I have PTSD and have been actually raped in the past. I was rationalizing this in light of that). \n\nHubby got with the DON who brought in the patient advocate. They later assured me they dealt with it. \n\nThree months later my nurse calls for help moving me after surgery, who walks in but him! I wouldn't let him touch me. \n\nI still wrestle with feeling I over reacted followed by feeling like he shouldn't have patient contact. ",

I've changed that slightly to allow patients to share their stories as well. \n\nThanks to /u/britrochtay who pointed out that using the term 'medical professional' excludes lots of staff who work in a medical setting such as cleaners, porters, receptionists etc. Of course they are just as welcome to share their stories here as medical professionals and patients, so I've modified the side bar and flairs accordingly. \n\n**Rules and Reports**\n\nI've dealt with all the reports, going back months, and removed some posts. From now on I will review every new post and apply some basic moderation.\n\nThe current rules are;\n\n1. All posts have to be related to medical stories\n2. No asking for medical advice\n3. All stories must be anonymised\n4. Be courteous and respectful\n\n\n**User Flairs**\n\nThe current user selectable flairs are;\n\n* Doctor \n* Nurse\n* Pharmacist\n* Researcher\n\nI've added\n\n* Patient\n* Physiotherapist \n* ~~Imagine~~ Imaging Tech (Thanks for the suggestion /u/jbarron81) (well done /u/TrailRatedRN you passed the test)\n\nI'm happy to add any number of profession based user selectable flairs, so feel free to make suggestions and I'll get them added. \n\n**Link Flair**\n\nI've added three link flairs;\n\n* Staff Story: for stories from the perspective of medical professionals\n* Patient Story: for stories form the patients point of view\n* Discussion: E.g. \"Tell me your best/worst story about...\"\n\n~~I'd be grateful if you can use them when creating threads in future.~~ In the meanwhile I'll see if I can automate it with automod in future. edit: its automated now\n\n**Going forward**\n\nI'm not going to sweep in and make huge changes...I think this sub is pretty great as it is.

        "text": "Not a medical professional here (worked as office manager in a med office for a while, but that's another conversation).  I just have a quick story.\n\nVERY loooong story short, the birth of my third child was an adventure.  From first strong contraction to final delivery was about thirty minutes, which is pretty darn fast in my understanding. OB was jam-packed that night, so my own OB, my backup OB, the staff OB, and every other OB was busier than one-legged men in ass-kicking contests.  \n\nThe only doctor available to me was either an unsupervised intern (highly unlikely), the world's greenest resident, or some ER guy who got drafted, because I seriously doubt he'd ever delivered a baby by himself before.  Mind you, he did an excellent job; but he was seriously rattled when things went off-script.  Luckily, to offset that, we had the world's most experienced OB nurse and her team.  Holy cow, that woman was three steps ahead of all of us the whole time, bless her.  She ran that room like a drill sergeant, in charge of everything (including the doctor!).  She was brilliant.\n\nWhen my daughter's head came out, she had the cord wrapped around her neck three times; she was not yet in distress, but the doctor had to untangle her before things could go south, and he told me (in a voice that was clearly strained; it scared me a bit) \"do not push.\"  Yeah, that worked about as well as you can imagine:  next contraction a few seconds later, out she comes (I swear, I didn't push; it all just kinda happened).  \n\nThis is what tickled my heart:  the doctor was not prepared for her to just suddenly pop out before he was finished doing his thing.  He caught the baby, and then just stood there, with a look of shock on his face that I will never ever forget.  But OB nurse was on top of it:  she was at his side, blanket in hand, saying, \"Give me the baby, give me the baby.\"  She said it three or four times before he gathered himself enough to hand the baby over.  After that, we were back on script, everything went normally.  \n\nDon't get me wrong:  I am NOT criticizing.  There were no complications, my daughter was safe and healthy (and has now grown into a beautiful, intelligent and dynamic young woman).  But thinking about that poor young man thrown into the deep end one crazy night, the look of surprise on his face, and that darling nurse taking charge like an old-school midwife, it all makes me smile every time I think about it.

My aunt deals with mental health issues and had to be admitted to the psych unit for stabilization/medication monitoring for a few weeks last spring. The health system in our city has been consolidating their services amongst their hospital campuses, so where she was a patient at only offers orthopedics and a psych ward. It doesn't even have an ER anymore because they closed that part in 2014. The hospital itself is also really old, built sometime between the late 1890's-early 1920's. One night one of the other patients on the unit kept complaining of hearing noises in the bathroom of her room and when a staff member came in to address the woman's complaints, they found worms crawling out of the drain in the shower because the plumbing is really outdated. As rundown as the building is and as much phasing out of services as has happened there over the years, I doubt that hospital will even be open five years from now.\n\nShare your stories!",

After you get past the initial shock of how amazing it all is, mixed with the white knuckled fear of making a mistake that could injure or kill or misdiagnose someone, toss in a dash of unspeakably disgusting smells, and it makes for quite the steep learning curve. Sometimes in the midst of it all you lose track of how to be social in this work setting. \n\nSo, you start to listen to the way ornery people interact, and suddenly you notice... people are talking about football, and politics, and how their kids are deiving them nuts. Suddenly I realized that, doctors are people too.... kind of. \n\nLol, anyways there was this day, early in my formative years I was prepping to do a lumbar laminectomy (basically a slipped spinal disk repair) and some song was on the radio. I was relieving someone who had started the case and was in the midst of taking report when the doctor started singing. It was elton johns tiny dancer. And one by one each of us joined in, the room was resonating in chorus. People walking by outside peeked in the windows. We really caused quite the commotion. \n\nIt was just a brief moment and things were back to the normalcy of before,  but it was a glimpse of what I could become when I finally got to a point of comfort. That when i became a competant surgical assistant that I could finally belong. No more gripping fear of ruining a fellow humans life for a simple miatake, but a genuine enjoyment of my vocation. \n\nLittle did I know that it'd be another 2 or so years before i got there. And in all honesty, when dealing with events of such magnitude as surgical intervention, an appropriate amount of fear is never a bad thing.",

I have done traveling,  and worked for a bunch of hospitals across the country, from Maine to Hawaii. And let me tell you, ive seen some shit.\n\nAlright, its time to get literal.\n\nThis one night shift i was working, a patient with a bowel obstruction came in for a disimpaction. Turns out he had opiate induced constipation. This is all pretty run of the mill stuff. The doctor was a lanky guy who talks slow and with the same cadence as john wayne. The resident he was training was a handsome young guy who's just about the sweetest guy in the world. With an aw shucks fella kind of attitude and indomitably positive disposition. \n\nAnyways, the patient arrives in the or, and hes in a considerable amount of discomfort  (lots of pressure ) after we put him asleep they get to work trying to remove the blockage. A poop stone literally and amazingly called a fecalith. Despite what many will lead you to believe, lots of surgeons will do whatever they can to remain minimally invasive.  In this case meaning manually manipulating this fecalith out of the patient.... with their hands.\n\nSo after about 20ish minutes of trying to push/pull this hardened crap ball out of the patient, hands elbow deep in his anus they finally birth this thing, easily the size of a softball. Which is MUCH harder to deliver than you'd think. So, because pressure has been building up behind this blockage its expected that a flow of feces is going to follow it. And its usually an impressive amount. But holy cowcrutches, the amount of feces that came out of this poor man. Has anyone ever worked in a restaurant and made a huuuge pot of stew and had to pour it out. The splashy ploppy noise it makes, very similar. It had the appearance of crunchy peanut butter that's been heated in the microwave. And it smelled surprisingly not too bad. But maybe im just used to.... yea, this.\n\nOur work is typically done once the fecalith is delivered, but in this case the stone was so large they had to a repair due to a tear. Which they did (much to my objection)  using the same gloves as they had on before. By the time they were done there was human feces in absolutely everything. The stirrups, the lights, aaaaaall over the floor, in all the crevices of the bed, splashed on the computer. The two surgeons looked like they'd been  clam digging. The resident, mr aw shucks... had it in his hair and shoes. Guess who had to clean it all up of course\n\nSo when I say I've  seen some shit... boy oh boy do I mean it.",

But...and here's the bad part...\n\nI recently had someone taking care of my cats who was supposed to come help me(very high functioning autism) figure out organising and cleaning on my own.  \nShe stole my Vyvanse. Not my other meds, not the Seroquel or Effexor or even the hydrocodone from my recent tooth removal(shattered wisdom tooth), just the Vyvanse. And that was in a drawer! The hydrocodone was in the bathroom on the counter! Yeah, yeah, bad me, not putting it into \"deep storage\" with some other things, but in my defense I was just unpacking some of my travel things that hadn't been used since the last trip I took the day after the tooth removal.\n\nNow all of a sudden my psych is telling me she's had doubts about the Vyvanse for a long time and wants me off of it, and has even said things about it before. And no, she never has. Not one question about if it was working, let alone voicing any sort of uncertainty about me taking it.  \nSo she wants to change me to a different medicine and start me on what she admits is a non-effective dose - literally too small a dose to do anything noticeable - at a time when I am going to need every bit of help that Vyvanse gives me. I HATE Florida and I'm going for two weeks starting the 19th. I'm going to have to be polite and nice and social. I'm not going to be able to be insular and scatterbrained and quiet. I'm going to have to leave the earbuds at home and have restaurant dinners and days out in the heat.\n\nMy psych says it's not because the bottle got stolen and she's not holing that against me, but just minutes later admitted that her number one, main, overarching reason she wants to start me on this new medicine is because the bottle got stolen from the back of my nightstand drawer.\n\nAm I being unreasonable when I say I don't want to start this new medicine until after I get back from Florida? Or is she being unreasonable by forcing it on me despite me begging her not to, and having panic attacks about it?",

        "text": "Home call is after hours calls for outpatient family medicine clinic patients answered by residents. My friend tells me two stories:\n\nSo he gets a call from a girlfriend of the patient complaining that her boyfriend has had an itchy rash on his back x two days and wants to know if she gives him Benadryl will it interact with his seizure medication. He looks it up and tells him no but he should come in to be seen because a rash could be due to a lot of things. They agree and say ok. \n\nNext night girlfriend calls back, again after hours and says. I'm worried his rash has gotten worse. Now he has blisters on his back where the rash is. Of course now it's Friday night and clinic won't be open until Monday. He advises them to go to urgent care first thing in the morning and be seen. The boyfriend finally gets on the phone and starts talking about how he is very concerned because he was recently hospitalized and almost died and doesn't want anything like that to happen again. \n\nMY FRIEND was so dumbfounded and just couldn't understand what they expected him to about it in the middle of the night OVER THE PHONE!!!!\n\n\nStory Number Two:\n\nThis one was a call at midnight from the mother of a patient who had just been discharged from long term nursing facility. This is usually inpatient care, but not quiet as intense as hospital care for people who are weak and not in the best shape after a long hospital stay. Anyway the daughter calls and tells my friend that the patient who is also a patient of the clinic that he is answering calls for that the mother fell as the ambulance people were getting her into her home after the discharge. The daughter also tells him that they then took her to the Emergency Department for evaluation. At the ED the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with her, no injury, nothing to admit her to the hospital for and they were going to discharge her back home. The reason the daughter called the clinic is because she was concerned that her mother shouldn't be at home alone over night and it wasn't right that they were discharging her home in \"her condition\". What condition that is, my friend knows nothing about because he knows nothing about the patient and was not there to evaluate her in person like the ER docs had who decided she was stable to go home. So at 12 am the daughter was just calling out of desperation as she is living in another city and her sister who is in town is at work so can't go be with the mom and she wants her to stay in the hospital until the morning. \n\nMy friend listened patiently to this whole rant, as it was and told her there was nothing he could do but to bring the mother back to clinic during DAYLIGHT hours to be evaluated. HE just couldn't' understand what the daughter thought was going to happen. He would just say sure, I'll go ahead and admit her to the hospital , no problem. ",

        "text": "I have been a medical receptionist working with a pediatrician for a bit over two years now. I love my job (most of the time) and I really enjoy seeing all the cute little faces every day. Sometimes people get angry over a lack of appointments which is understandable. We should have stopped accepting new patients a long time ago but that is beyond my control. We're now at a point where we're fully booked for 3 weeks at a time. The doctor has always had a policy that if a child has not been here for a full calendar year then we close their file and they aren't our patient any longer. So yesterday I get a phone call from a woman whose child has not been here for almost 3 years. I informed her that his file is closed, and the conversation went something like this:\n\nWoman: Hi, I would like to make an appointment for Child'sname\n\nMe: I'm sorry but your child has not been here in almost 3 years, you will have to see Child'sname's family physician\n\nWoman: That is absolutely ridiculous, I DEMAND an appointment.\n\nMe: I'm sorry but he will have to see his family physician as our practice is full.\n\nWoman: Email me his file.\n\nMe: We do not email charts or personal information, but I would be more than happy to fax his chart to his family doctor upon their request.\n\nWoman: Then I will come to the office to pick up.\n\nMe: No problem, but there will be a 50 dollar charge.\n\nWoman: I DEMAND to be transferred to the doctor.\n\nAt this point I can tell that she is getting super angry and I am in \"kill her with kindness\" mode.\n\nMe: I'm sorry but the doctor is busy with a patient, but if there's something that I can ask her for you and call you back, I would be happy to do so.\n\n Woman: LISTEN HERE, YOU BETTER LET ME TALK TO THE DOCTOR RIGHT NOW, AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME AN APPOINTMENT.\n\nMe: no, I don't.\n\nWoman: I AM GOING TO KILL YOU.\n \nI shit you not. She said she was going to kill me.\n\nMe: WOAH LADY! You cannot talk to me like that.\n\n*hang up*\n\nShe then proceeded to call back about 6-7 times, I did not answer the phone. I informed the doctor and she told me to phone the police. I phoned the police, an officer came here, got all her info and said that they were going to let her know that she is not allowed withing a certain distance of our office and next time it would be a criminal charge. \n\nI'm not even gonna lie, this incident scared me...who goes around threatening to kill people? Crazy people. What types of people shoot others over trivial shit like this? Crazy people. I barely got any sleep last night, and today, every time the office door opens I hold my breath.\n\nShit like this is not right, stuff like this should not happen. I hope nothing comes out of this and in a few months I can look back and laugh at this incident. But until then, cross your fingers for me.",

        "text": "I went to my dermatologist this morning.  It was, yet again, the most anxiety-inducing situation I've endure in a while. It's a long story that I will try to keep short. Here's the back information:\n\n\nAbout 10 years ago I suffered from terrible acne. I was a teenager and the logical choice for my mother to make for me at the time was to take me to the dermatologist (since OTC washes weren't working). I met this wonderful woman who would trial run me on a variety of things until eventually, I was placed on Accutane. I loved it for the first three or four months. That was until I had severe side effects. I was immediately pulled off of the medication and never saw this dermatologist again (mainly because I was embarrassed that upon news of my side effects, I was told she cried and essentially took the blame).\n\n\nFast forward to early this spring. I had been dealing with acne on and off for a while and though I never went back to my dermatologist (her office is the only one within 30 minutes of my house), I told myself that I would just have to live with it. When talking to a friend of mine, she mentioned that I should go back and try out the medicine she was on. After much back and forth with myself, I scheduled an appointment.When I arrived I learned that I wasn't seeing my old doctor but a PA. Okay, I thought, maybe this is for the best.\n\nThe PA came in. Loud. Like, super loud. I'm an introvert, though, so maybe it's just me. She proceeded to tell me that I hadn't been in for a long time and told me that my file had been sealed. She asked me why. I was feeling open at the time. I thought, you know, there's nothing to hide, no big deal, let me just tell her. I wouldn't realize until later that I shouldn't have. She didn't judge me at the time and we proceeded the visit. She told me she would place me on a topical and see how it went. I left still not liking how loud she was but all in all, it was okay. I was to see her in a couple of months.\n\nA couple of months later, I went in again. Again, she was loud. I told her that my topical was working fine but that I was still getting some under-the-skin zits. She immediately went into a condescending tone telling me that she didn't think I could handle anything oral and I should just up the frequency of application to three or four times a day and see if that's better. After seemingly forever, I talked her into letting me try a super low dose of Spironolactone. She said I wouldn't be able to handle the normal dose (100-200mg), so I asked what she thought I could handle: \"25mg twice a day. Maximum.\" Okay. That's fine. So she gave me the prescription. I was to see her in a year.\n\nOver the course of four months (I ended up only needing it once a day for visual improvement), I was pretty happy with my results. It wasn't 100% but having a zit once a week or two that was super small was no worries for me. I went to pick up my prescription from the pharmacist yesterday but was told that my refill was denied and I needed to call my doctor. When I did, the receptionist seemed confused but said that it must be important for my PA to do that. I made an appointment for the next morning (this morning) and took off work.\n\nI went this morning and honestly, I wasn't looking forward to seeing her. Keep in mind, she's loud, and I'm quiet. And she likes to assume I'm dumb. (The comfort level isn't helped by the office being considered a \"MedSpa\" that is every shade of teal with black accents to make it look like it came out of a Southern Living magazine--super formal.)\n\nI'm 15 minutes early and get taken back quickly. I then stand in the room for about 15 minutes, no problem. She gets in and starts asking me questions loudly. Again, no problem. She asks me how things are, I say fine. She asks if I've seen improvement, I say yes. She asks how much--40, 50%; I say I'm not sure. It's gone but I don't want to say 100% since I still get one or two if I don't wash my face at night. She asks me to sit. I didn't want to (since I don't want to mess up the table since this was to be a routine chat), but I did. She then tells me that because I don't seem \"excited\" about my results, she's just going to take me off of them. It was so that I would remember what I was like when I first came in. I told her that no, I was happy, but I was confused as to why I was no longer getting refills. She said it was because it's regulation to monitor me. Okay. \"But why?\" I asked out of curiosity. \"Because you told me yourself that you are not fully capable of taking medication, that you're suceptible to issues, and you can't handle the side effects which are sure to come up with you.\" She then asked me about my side effects currently. I said it was fine. She asked again because she \"knew I had some.\" I said that if I don't take it was food (which I said was my fault since the bottle says to take with food), I will get dizzy or nauseated. \"See, now we're getting somewhere,\" she responded. She then told the nurse to combine my dose to 50mg once a day. I asked her not to do that. I was taking the pills once a day, I told her, about 8/14 pills a week, maybe. \"It's meant as a preventative, not a spot treatment,\" she responded. Okay. I understand. \"If you take it like that you're more likely to have side effects.\" Okay. Then she told me she would give me the prescription for the year. I thanked her and she left with the nurse. Before the nurse could go and after the PA already left, I asked why I had been moved from the doctor I used to see. I was told if I don't ask, I get the one that is most available. Fair enough.\n\nI ended up leaving the office anxious and ashamed. I felt like there wasn't any bedside manner or even common decency with me. She was very curt, short, and aggressive.\n\nFor the record, the incident that occurred at the beginning of the story was basically depressive, panic, anxiety induced in which I almost committed suicide. It wasn't a happy time in my life. Yet, I don't believe that I need to prove my mental wellbeing to a PA now by jumping for joy when she asks how the one thing I hate in my life (acne) is doing.\n\nSo is my PA a jerk (and should I say something) or am I being silly?\n\nThanks so much for your reading.\n\nTL;DR: PA threatens to not refill two acne medications because I wasn't visibly excited about my results. Is she being the jerk or am I?",

        "text": "I worked in my father-in-law's medical billing office.  He was an orthopaedic surgeon in practice with 3 other orthopods.\n\nThey hired a third-party vendor to install and configure billing software so we could bill electronically.  I had been hired to help with the transition to computers and to help with some of the billing tasks.\n\nThe third-party vendor also offered billing office management as well as billing software implementation.  My father-in-law did not want to hire them to manage the billing office, but his partners did.  So that happened.\n\nOne of the tasks of the third-party company was to hire a coder for our office.  They enlisted the help of another third-party to find and hire this coder.  The company that provided the coder offered a 60 day trial so if the employee they provided did not work out, you did not owe them a commission.\n\nSo the coder starts at our office and I start giving her work.  At the time, I was not a professional medical billing office staff person.  I was going to school for computing and my father-in-law helped me out with this job.  It was nothing I couldn't handle, but there were some things I relied on other people in the office (who had been there for years) to tell me.  Like how long it should take to code a certain number of cases.\n\nOur new coder seemed slow.  I asked the other office staff and they agreed.  I would hand her a dozen cases and it would take her half a day to finish them.  I spoke to the medical billing software company owner and made him aware that she was a little slow, but otherwise seemed fine (we weren't getting denials from insurance companies on what she coded).\n\nA month goes by and while it didn't seem possible, she got even slower.  Now a dozen cases would take her a whole day.  I spoke to her directly and told her we needed her to work faster.  I also notified the medical billing software company owner that we were still having problems.  He ignored me and told me she was fine.\n\nWork was piling up.  I spoke to the coder again and made it clear that we would have to let her go if she couldn't work faster.  She basically told me I couldn't get her fired and she didn't work for me, she worked for medical billing software company owner (she didn't).\n\nBut, she seemed to start working faster.  Now she was getting through a day's case in a day.  That's great!\n\nExcept that only lasted for a couple of weeks and she slowed down again.  She was also late almost every day and tried to leave early a bunch of times.  Once again I notify the medical billing software company owner and once again he tells me she is fine and to stop bothering him.\n\nWe now have two weeks before we are locked into paying a commission to the company who found the coder for us.  I talk to her again and I wait another week.  By this time, she thinks she has determined that nothing I say matters because medical billing software company's owner thinks she's great.\n\nI'm done with her.  I'm done with medical billing software company's owner ignoring the info I've given him.  I go to talk to my father-in-law.  I've gathered metrics on how many cases she has coded in the time she's been working for us, how many cases had been denied by insurance (only a few), how many cases we had outstanding that still needed to be coded (along with a nice chart showing how many days old they were) and how often she'd been late, etc.\n\nMy father-in-law calls medical billing software company owner and speaks to him about it.  I can only hear one side of the conversation, but I can tell my father-in-law is getting an ear full of B.S.  I wait until he's done and I remind him we only have a week to fire her unless we want to pay the commission to the employment company ($1500).\n\nThen I go back to the billing office where I find the coder has left early (again).  I start looking at the work she has on her desk.  There are only about 6 cases on her desk and I know I've given her more work than that this week.\n\nI start looking in the drawers of her desk.  Where I find piles upon piles of old cases.  I mean every single drawer of this monster, 1940's metal office desk is filled with cases that she hasn't even touched.  I am pissed.\n\nI start looking at the cases.  Some of them have notes on them like \"no DOB, can't file\" or \"ask Dr {insert name here} about whether he did A or B\".  The missing information on all the cases that were tagged could have been obtained with a single phone call or during her weekly meeting with each doctor.\n\nSome of these cases date back to her first day of work.  Most of them are at least a month old. I organized them and created a chart for my father-in-law so he could see how much money (from unclaimed insurance) was sitting in the drawer of her desk and for how long.\n\nThat night at his home, I went over the information with him (he was already on rounds at the hospital by the time I finished looking at the cases and we were having dinner at his house that night).\n\nThe next morning, he calls the medical billing software company owner and tells him he needs to come to our office and fire this coder immediately.  That happens and then my father-in-law and his partners fire the medical billing software company owner.\n\nI get made temporary billing office manager while they look for someone to do it full time.  It took about a month to hire someone.  The new manager was awesome.  She hired a coder (we outsourced the coding until we got the manager and a new coder) and fixed a lot of other problems in both the billing office and medical office.",

        "text": "Not sure this fits here, but it did happen in a medical office so here goes.\n\nMany years ago I worked in my father-in-law's medical billing office.  He was an orthopaedic surgeon.\n\nI was studying computing and his practice was having their billing converted from paper to a computerized billing software package.  This was in the early days of computing and the software system was owned, installed and managed by a third-party company.\n\nMy job was to help the current billing office staff input paper records into the computer so we could bill electronically instead of manually and to help the staff learn to use the new system.\n\nThe guy who owned the software company was a bit of a douche canoe and I'd already had trouble with him when I tried to tell him the software wasn't working as advertised or wasn't configured the way we needed it to be.  Without even checking out the info I gave him, he'd go into denial and say everything was working as advertised.  I just kept documenting what wasn't working and put it into a report for my father-in-law and he'd give the report to the software company owner and the problems would be fixed.\n\nThe other part of my job was to go over any unpaid accounts with my father-in-law.  He would go over every unpaid bill personally.  He'd pick up a bill and start telling me a bit about the person such as \"this lady is very poor and her husband has been out of work for a while so we'll just write this bill off\" or \"this man has more money than he knows what to do with.  Send one more bill and then send him to collections\".\n\nYes, he knew every patient and he wrote off a lot of unpaid accounts because he didn't feel right going after people who really couldn't pay.\n\nOne day, I got a call from a patient.  It was an elderly lady whose name I recognized from my father-in-law's unpaid bill review.  He had told me to write off her bill and don't send her any more for the visit in question.  \n\nUnbeknownst to me, before he told me to write the bill off, our new software billing system had sent her a dunning notice, demanding payment and threatening to not only ruin her credit but to also sue her for what she owed.  She calls the billing office and I take her call.  This lady was in tears but she was very apologetic, telling me she just couldn't pay the bill right now and could we please give her a little time.\n\nI reassured her that she didn't owe us anything and that a mistake had been made.  She was very grateful as she had an appointment for the next day and she was afraid my father-in-law wouldn't see her because of the unpaid bill.  I assured her she would absolutely be seen and, by the way, would she please bring the dunning notice she received?\n\nI then called the owner of the software company because we had explicitly told him we did not want dunning notices sent out.  Again, without checking, his immediate response was that his software had absolutely not sent out any dunning notices.  Again, rather than waste any time arguing with him, I just decided I would talk to my father-in-law the next day during our billing review meeting.\n\nI knew he had a meeting with the software company owner immediately after his meeting with me and I'd just let him deal with it.\n\nThe next day, I meet with my father-in-law, we review the bills and as a last item, I tell him about the dunning notices.  I had the one the elderly lady had brought in with her and I showed it to him.\n\nHe was furious.  Rather than wait for our meeting to end, he calls his receptionist and tells her to send software company owner in immediately.

It's mostly rehab wards so it's an overnight shift but generally you get to sleep through the night without any issues. \n\nSo it was 2am and I get woken up by a call from a nurse;\n\n\"Hi doctor I'm really worried about this patient. He was catheterised today and I checked it because he said it was irritating his penis. When I had a look his foreskin was retracted and I can't put it back.\"\n\n\"Okay, that sounds like a paraphimosis. Is the penis swollen or discoloured?\"\n\n\"It's not discoloured and doesn't seem swollen, but the foreskin seems to be retracted back really really tightly.\"\n\n\"Have you tried compressing it or soaking it in glucose?\"\n\n\"Yes. They didn't work.\"\n\n\"Okay I'll be down in a minute.\"\n\nSo as I got ready, I had visions of doing a penile ring block and puncturing the glans with a needle. Just like you read in the textbooks. \n\nSo I get to the patient, the nurse takes me to the patient, and I begin to examine the penis.\n\nAfter a few seconds I'm happy with the diagnosis. I turn to the nurse and say;\n\n\"I'm not worried, this doesn't require any treatment.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" She replies, \"what is the problem\"\n\n\"That's not a paraphimosis....\n\nThe patient is just circumcised.\"",

A 15 year old girl overheard me and my friend talking and came over when my friend had walked away. From here on out we will call the 15 year old Sophia.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Sophia: Hey, I over heard your conversation and was wondering if you could help me. I think I’m pregnant.   \n&gt; Me: Oh, okay. Have you taken a pregnancy test?\n&gt; &gt; Sophia: Yeah, it came up negative.\n&gt; Me: Oh, that’s good. You are most likely no… Sophia: But we’ve had sex since then.\n&gt; Me: You know the tests don’t predict pregnancy, right?\n&gt; &gt; Sophia: Well, I thought they might be able to…\n&gt; Me: Well, did you use protection?\n&gt; Sophia: Yes! We use condoms. \n\n\nI was really happy until I realized this 15 year old had thought pregnancy tests could predict pregnancy’s so I asked her a little more.\n\n\n&gt; Me: How did you use the condom? Sophia: Well, he put it on his penis.\n&gt; Me INTERNALLY: GOOD FOR HER! Sophia:Then he took it off and put his penis inside me. Me INTERNALLY: *screams*\n&gt; Me: Why did he take the condom off before sex? Sophia: Because it had spermicide in it. Me: I understand how you could have thought that but that isn’t how condoms work. The condom acts as a barrier between you and your partner to protect against STI’s and then it catches his sperm so that they can’t fertilize any eggs. However, this method isn’t 100% effective so a lot of people will pair it with other forms of birth control to be safe. Sophia: Well, my family is pretty strict so I can’t go get another test and I can’t use any other birth control.\n&gt; Me: Would you like me to take you to get another test?  Sophia: We also used the pull out method.\n&gt; Me: Well, that is a good thing to try but you have to be very good with the timing for it to be effective. Not to mention the fact that there is sperm in precum. Most of it will die out due to the acidity of the urine it comes into contact with so the chances are low that the precum could have gotten you pregnant. \n\n\nThis went on for about an hour. She would tell me how they tried to be safe and then right after explain how they didn’t actually do what they needed to. For example, when her boyfriend had pulled out, he had done so AFTER he ejaculated and then wiped himself off on her thigh. \n\n\nI drove her to a drug store and walked her through all the contraceptives they had and then walked her through how to take the pregnancy test. Luckily she was not pregnant but I don’t think she was ever able to understand just how lucky she was. \n\n\nI went home and took a nice long bath...",

He was eventually pulled over and arrested for DUI and had been released on bail and came to the hospital. \n\nApparently unconcerned about the DUI, he had come to the office to ask the secretary to get his surgeon to write him a prescription for medical marijuana, so that he couldn't get in trouble for possession. \n\nAfter about 45 minutes of explaining that even if the surgeon *did* agree to write the prescription, since he didn't have it when he got arrested, it probably wouldn't help his case, the man left.

It's kind of a sad update, so I wasn't all that psyched, I guess.\n\nThe patient came to her appointment, accompanied by her parents. Her mom, a very mild mannered and courteous lady in her fifties, signed her in, and sat holding the Patient's hand. The Patient seemed to be staring off into nothing. Her dad stood by the corner, arms crossed, next to them and glared at me every now and then. (When the doctor called them in, his face switched to the happiest smile ever).\n\nOnce out, Patient's dad threw the co-pay money at me and stormed out. Patient and her mom said goodbye (patient's mom looked red eyed) and left after him. \n\nAfter we were done for the day, Dr. R filled me in on the situation. The Patient is in her late twenties and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Apparently she'd been showing symptoms for a while, but her dad wouldn't take her to a shrink because he didn't believe in that. Late last year the Patient had a total breakdown and had to be checked into a psych ward. \n\nIt seems her mom's family has a history of mental health issues. Her dad thinks any mental illness is hogwash (Dr. R quoted him: \"It's all lack of willpower\"). After the Patient's breakdown, and during her seclusion/treatment her mom disclosed the family history, the Patient was diagnosed, prescribed meds and other treatment, and after more than a month, released.\n\nOf course, her dad didn't buy it, and claimed that if she was sick, it must be a tumor or some \"real\" disease. The MRI and CT Scans came back negative for tumors, lesions, etc. \n\nLong story short, Dr. R had an argument with the dad, told him he HAD to provide his daughter with the prescribed treatment, that mental illnesses were very real, and that his refusal to get her treatment would only further endanger her well being. \n\nAfter they were gone, Dr. R called the Patient's psychiatrist (her mom had given him the doctor's info), and told him about the situation. I don't know what else they talked about, but apparently one of them was going to report the situation as negligence. \n\nEdit: Spelling",

It was also the end of a long, extremely stressful day for me and it was just too much. So I sat and cried at my desk for the next half an hour.",

I called our PC's office to ask for a refill of a compounded prescription for my husband. It's been a couple years since he filled it, so he doesn't have any of the packaging any more, so when they asked me what the dosing information was, I didn't know. I asked that they look in his records to see what it was written for the last time, but they said they'd recently computerized and couldn't find the information. I was surprised at this, but whatever. She said I'd have to call the pharmacy, get the information, and call back. Again, whatever, but it's compounded so it's a little more complicated and I was afraid it would lose something going from the pharmacy to me to the doctor's office and didn't want to screw it up.\n\n I asked them to please ask the pharmacy when they called it in, and was told that they \"don't call pharmacies.\" I said, \"Sure you do. You call in prescriptions all the time.\" She clarified that they do not call pharmacies to ask questions, only to give orders. The pharmacist said it didn't make any sense to her, that she talks to medical offices all the time. Does it make sense to you, from your perspective as a medical office employee?",

First floor was Administration, ER, OR; Second floor was OB/GYN and ICU; Third floor was Surgical; Fourth floor was Medical- which is where I worked.\n\nAnd on Medical, we also had Pediatrics, Stepdown ICU, Ventilator patients, any patients that required an Isolation room [Heps, TB, AIDS, etc . . .] and overflow.\n\nOne night [I was working 11p-7a] a Physician made rounds. He was a well known civic leader, on the Hospital Board of Physicians, well loved by his clientele, a respected community leader, etc . . . Everyone loved this guy. At the time he was in his late 60's, and was known to do rounds 2-3 times a day.\n\nI would say that half of the 40 patients on the floor were under his care and on this night he made updates in their progress notes and wrote a few orders. [This was done in the days BEFORE computerized orders/notes].\n\nI started going through the hard charts that he left out and proceeded to transcribe/route his orders to the correct department, when I got to an order on one of the charts.  I could not read what he had written.  \n\nI called switchboard to see if the Doctor was still on site. Luckily he was on Third. Called Third and asked if they could send the Doctor back up to Fourth when he had finished there. They said he would.\n\nAbout 1/2hour later, the elevator doors open and there he is. I handed him the chart and informed him that I am unable to read this order and I needed him to clarify what he had written. He read his order. He read his older orders for this patient. He read the progress notes. He looked at the Nursing notes and other ancillary notes in the chart.\n\nFinally, he looked at me and told me that he had 'No idea what this order was for'. He took his pen, drew a straight line through the order, wrote 'ERROR, wrong chart', initialed his changes, got on the elevator and left.\n\nNeither one of us [or other staff] could ever figured out what he was trying to convey.  \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that the Doctor was at one time a member of the [State] House of Representatives and started one of the first long term care facilities in the area.\n",

I was still seeing my Pediatric clinic (this story is why I went to a regular Doctor) and I went in with symptoms of a prolonged sinus infection and bad ear infection. I am a very friendly person that will only be rude to someone if they are rude to me, but this day was different.   \n\nDespite my massive ear pain, the young Doctor (probably fresh out of residency) wanted to irrigate my ear.  She had my head over the sink and as soon as she pushed the syringe of water into my ear, it became the worst pain in my 19 years (until that night, we will get to that).  I jumped back and yelped in pain.  I threw up my hands and said \"I know you are a Doctor, but I really don't think shooting water into an infected ear for any reason is a good idea\"!  I apologized to her, checked out, and went on my \"merry\" way.  \n\nLater that night at my Husband's house (then Fiance), I was curled up in a fetal position with the absolute worst ear pain I had ever had, and honestly the worst pain in my now 33 years.  I have had broken bones, post-op pain, had a baby, and a number of other painful things in my life, but nothing compares to this ear pain.  It was at this point that I went to a Doctor that deals with all ages.  He ended up giving me a very potent antibiotic, numbing ear drops, and another type of ear drop.  He told me that the water from the irrigation had stayed in my ear and became a breeding ground for my infection to flourish.  He mentioned that the young Doctor should have never irrigated an infected ear, regardless of the circumstances.  I spent the next 5 weeks with no hearing in my right ear.  To this day I still remember when and where I was when my ear opened up and I could hear again.  I know Doctors are NOT perfect, so I don't speak or think poorly of her, but I learned at that moment that a Pediatric Doctor was not for me.  ",

        "text": "So I live in a town built around a very old medical practice, so just getting a flu shot plunged me deep into the underbelly of the beast. I was raised there, had been there a million times before for every type of visit I ever had, still got letters from there, pretty much did all of my major medical stuff there.\n\nI also *really* don't like needles. This doesn't match the fact that my dad's a doctor and a diabetic, and I've heard his stories about shots and seen him give himself shots a million times. Or maybe it does match, I don't know. The fact remains that they are numbers 1-10 on my list of Top 10 Least Favorite Things. Even just typing this out is giving me a stomachache.\n\nAdditionally, this was back around the glory days of H1N1, and in the middle of winter, so I was apprehensive about the prospect of all kinds of flus to begin with, and still just as apprehensive about the prospect of getting shots. On balance, though, I obviously went in to get a flu shot.\n\nI went in with my mom when I was visiting. They had this big area set up just for the flu shot, which was unusual, which just made my imagination worse. I *also* don't like blood. Really, *really* don't like blood. (Goodness, I would not be a good doctor. I probably chose a Bachelor of Arts subconsciously in case I somehow *accidentally became a doctor*.)\n\nMy mom and I waited, and I got called up first to one station, and she must have gotten called up soon after by another station, because she wasn't there when I came out. So I just sat, stared off into space, and waited.\n\nAfterwards, we were walking back through this eternal hallway, not really saying anything, while I replayed my shot over and over and over again in my mind. My mom spoke up and said my face was really white, and asked if I was feeling okay. So I explained.\n\nI had just been sitting there getting a shot like I always would, curling up my toes and clutching the sides of the chair. The nurse was polite and chatting with me while I tried to put on a bravely casual face while she was getting it ready. Weather, work, school, and *oh no there it is time to look away and clench my teeth and squeeze my eyes shut*. But I told myself it would all be over in a few seconds.\n\n\"And there's the poke,\" she said. I exhaled a bit, slightly relieved. Almost there. \"Oh wow, *that* was a *gusher*.\" My own blood all over my arm. She dabs it clean, then ties my arm while I'm reeling in a daze looking away with that image forever seared into my consciousness.\n\nSwitched to a Communications degree around then.",

        "text": "The last ten days have been pretty rough.  My SO had to have major surgery unexpectedly and we received some pretty substandard care at times.\n\nThis is only relevant because I was pretty much out of patience in dealing with people because of stress and lack of sleep.\n\nBut surgery goes well and my SO gets to come home.  Woot!\n\nThe day after he's released we have to go back to the hospital to get him a blood test.  No big, we got this.\n\nI pull up to the hospital main entrance so he can go in and get things started while I park our truck.  Since he had surgery, he's moving a bit slow, but in the time it took me to pull up, him to open the door and put one leg out, there is a car behind us honking.\n\nNow we live in a small town and people here are normally extraordinarily nice.  Having anyone honk at you for any reason is a rarity.\n\nHe gets his other leg out of the car and gives the driver a dirty look before heading into the hospital. It couldn't have been more than a minute for me to stop and him to get out.  As soon as he shuts his car door, I drive off in search of parking.\n\nI park and go into the hospital.  I find him at the registration desk.  We are standing there waiting for our clerk to come back (she stepped away for a minute) when the driver of the car that honked at us comes up to the desk where we are registering for the test.  \n\nShe'll be OB (for old bitch), I'll be me and my husband will be SO.\n\nOB: \"You know, your truck is very long and if you'd just pull up a little more, I wouldn't have had to wait.\"\n\nNote: Our truck is a regular sized pick up truck.\n\nSO: \"Ma'am, I just had open-heart surg...\"\n\nOB: \"EVERYONE has problems, that gives you no righ...\"\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, you need to get away from us.\"\n\nNote: Honestly, I pretty much lost it here.  I have no idea what she actually said after this because I was seeing red.  I have rheumatoid arthritis and the stress and lack of sleep had taken it's toll on me.  I was in pain, but couldn't take anything for it because I was driving.\n\nOB: \"BLAH, Blah, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!\"\n\nMe (In a slightly louder voice): \"Ma'am, You NEED to get away from us!\"\n\nOB: \"BLAH, Blah, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!\"\n\nAt this point, I've actually turned my back on her and I put my arm protectively around my husband's waist. I actually hoped turning my back on her would be her clue to leave.  It wasn't.\n\nOB: \"BLAH, Blah, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!\"\n\nMe (in my loudest voice before glass breaks): \"MA'AM, YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM US RIGHT NOW!!!!!\"\n\nFinally, she walks away.\n\nOur clerk comes back and asks us what's going on.  My SO explains that a woman we didn't know came up and was being very rude to us.  We get our paperwork and go into the lab, where there are another husband and wife waiting.\n\nThey ask us what happened and again my husband told them we'd been accosted by this rude, entitled woman and she just wouldn't leave us alone.\n\nApparently, they'd actually seen the whole thing and agreed with my SO on the woman being the problem.\n\nThen the woman comes into the lab.  I'm still fuming, but I ignore her while I wait behind the first couple.  She mumbled something that I didn't quite catch but I could still tell was her being completely entitled.  The other couple just glares at her and smiles at us.\n\nWhen we get finished and get back to the car, my husband tells me that a very large crowd had gathered around us during the first encounter with the woman.\n\nHe said the woman had finally gotten so embarrassed by the number of people staring at her that she just quit talking and went away.\n\nI told him if that ever happened again I was just going to cover my ears and go \"La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la...\"",

My boss is technically Dr.M, but since Dr. R's secretary is on leave, I'm fielding for both teams. \n\nThis story is about a patient of Dr. R. This is a patient who hasn't been to our office in over 4 1/2 years. She used to receive treatment regarding her cervical disks, and spinal cord. Today her family called demanding to speak to Dr. R, saying it was urgent, life or death, etc. Dr. R was seeing patients, so I took a message and told the guy we'd call him back after we were done with today's appointments. Message basically was that the patient was currently locked up in the psychiatric ward because she's started hearing and seeing things. And that it was urgent that they speak to Dr. R. \n\nAt the end of the day, I told Dr. R about the call, and he seemed perplexed as to why they called him. He looked up her record and pointed out her condition had nothing to do with this, and that the patient should be seeking further psychological or psychiatric attention. As for evaluating the patient, he won't do it over the phone based on what someone else has to say about her condition, and that if they wanted a consultation, they needed to make an appointment once the patient was released from her psych hold so he could evaluate her in person. He added they should perform MRI first, then schedule an appointment.  \n\nSo, being the diligent little duck I am, I called the patient's family back and related the doc's expressions. I said the doctor would not do telephone evaluations, particularly when (a) he hadn't seen the patient in several years, and (b) the symptoms held no relation to the condition he had treated. Also told them to get the MRI done, and that we could coordinate an appointment. \n\nDude: I really don't believe the doctor would say that. I called because we need a consultation, he's her doctor, and I really don't believe he'd say that. \n\nMe: Well, I'm sorry, but those were his instructions. \n\nDude: But I wanted to speak to him. I called for an evaluation, and I just don't believe he said that. \n\nMe: Yes, but seeing as how Dr. R hasn't seen [patient] in several years, and he has no info on this condition she's showing now-\n\nDude: But I need to speak to him. Not you. He's her doctor. I don't believe he'd say he couldn't evaluate her. \n\nMe: He can evaluate her, but he needs studies, and actually seeing the patient. \n\nDude: But we need to know what wrong with her! Did you tell him that?! If you did, why would he refuse to talk to me?! We need that consultation. \n\nMe: Sir, there's really nothing more I can do. \n\nDude: I just don't believe he'd say that.\n\nMe: ...\n\nDude: Well, give me an appointment. When are they?\n\nMe: Next spot's in two weeks.\n\nDude: Fine. But did you tell him this was about [patient]? \n\nMe: Yes. Gave him her record. \n\nDude: Then why would he say that?\n\nMe: ...\n\nDude: Fine. [Hangs up]",

I attempted to use over the counter medication for congestion, and steam to help clear it out, but to no avail. \n\n\nI eventually go to a doctor and he says I'm just congested. He prescribes me stronger meds to try and open my nose up, which ends up failing. After 2 more visits to a clinic and 2 more medications that fail to help even the slightest, I take a flashlight and see for myself what is going on.\n\n\nWhen I do look inside, I see this white ....thing... in my nostril, and it spooked me at first. It was clear  that this wasn't just ordinary nasal congestion. So I chose to point it out next time I tried to get it looked at.\n\n\nEventually, I go to a doctor one more time, and after saying its \"merely congested\" I mention something specifically in my left nostril. He takes a second look and finally acknowledges that its not just \"congestion\". He tells me that I may have a nasal polyp, and he recommends me to visit an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist.)\n\n\nAfter the last visit I have a mixed feeling of relief, and frustration, and my frustration would only continue. After confirming that I have a polyp, the specialist informs me he no longer does surgery. I now have to visit another specialist in the next town over to get looked at. After getting looked at a second time, I finally get scheduled for an outpatient surgery. \n\n\nJust some extra info: The polyp had completely blocked out the left side of my nose, and it was making its way onto the right side, as far as I can tell it was very large as far as polyps go.\n\n\nTL;DR:After 4 visits to different doctors and 2 specialists, I finally get surgery to fix a very simple problem over the course of an entire year.\n\n\nHas anyone else ever had this kind of run-around where doctors would just ignore something this obvious?",

        "text": "I work at a vet. About a year ago here in Florida they passed a law saying that any dog or cat food that is classified as prescription is to be treated the same as any prescription medication. This means it must be doctor recommended, and it can only be dispensed if the pet has a current exam with that vet office (same requirements as prescription medication). We are not a pharmacy so we can't just dispense with a written prescription, we have to have seen the pet within the last year. \n\nDue to this change we were initially a little lenient for customers who usually were only in to purchase food. We would sell them one more bag when they came in, but tell them that in order to purchase prescription food again they have to bring their pet in for a FREE exam, and then they're good for the next year. Most people were OK with this since it's a free exam and all it entails is about a half an hour of their time. But not everyone took it so well...this is the story of an irate and stubborn customer who had me shaking with anger and fear by the end of our interaction. \n\nSo the customer comes in, sees his food on our shelf and asks if we have the bigger bag. I say sure, and go to get it for him. I ask for his name so I can put the food on the account and charge him out. When I pull the account up, I remember who this guy is and see the alert that *I* had written about a month and half prior. \n\nAt that time I told the customer that in order to continue to sell the prescription food, we would need to see his dog for a FREE exam. I recalled that when I told him this he said it was hard to get his dog out and about because he is old (and a pit bull that we suspect may not be licensed, but that's a different story). I told him I understood, but that it is the law now and if he didn't want to come in to see us he would have to find a mobile vet to get an exam and the food from from now on. He seemed happy enough with that response and left with no complaints. \n\nFast forward to current day...I told him that we had already let him know previously that we could not sell him anymore food without an exam, so I would not be able to sell it to him today. This guy went from content to enraged in about 0.2 seconds. I've never witnessed anyone freak out so swiftly. He began yelling at me \n\nHim: \"Well what changed?? Did the food change?!\" \n\nMe: \"No, the law changed.\"\n\nHim: \"Well, what changed?!\"\n\nMe: \"I don't know sir, I'm not a lawmaker.\" (I know, a little sassy, but I was very shaken up at this point.)\n\nHim: \"Well I'm not either!\" \n\nMe: \"I'm sorry sir, but I could get fired over this. It is the law and I am not willing to break the law.\"\n\nHim: \"Is this how it's going to be every time?!\"\n\n(He's getting so mad and yelling so much that I'm honestly concerned for a second that he's going to jump over the counter and take the bag of food and run. He was kind of a big dude, so he was scary when he was angry.)\n\nMe: \"Yes, unless you're able to bring [pet name] in for an exam.\"\n\nHim: \"I can't believe I've been coming here for 11 years for food and now you guys are just treating me like an OUTCAST!!\"\n\nMe: ????? \"I'm sorry sir, there's nothing I can do about this, I'm just a receptionist.\"\n\nHe eventually asks for the manager (who was out of the office for about an hour to go to the bank, which he was none too happy about either). I told him she would call him the second she got back in. \n\nAfter relaying the situation to my manager (and us laughing hysterically at him saying he felt like \"an outcast\"), she called him and he didn't answer. He never returned her call, and we haven't heard from him since. \n\nI understand his frustration, it's a shitty situation and it sucks that the law was changed that way, but it's no excuse to scream at another human being who is just doing their job. The whole thing would have left a much worse taste in my mouth if I didn't still laugh when I think about him yelling about being an \"outcast\" because I wouldn't sell him dog food...",

Honestly, it scares me that someone like this exists.\n\nAt their office, when a new patient arrives, as part of their personal information they must inform:\n  \n1) Number of sexual partners they've had throughout their whole life.   \n2) An emergency contact.  \n\nSo, this girl (G) shows up, and as she's filling out her record she steps up to my friend's (F) counter, because she doesn't understand some of what's required of her.\n\nG: Here, about sexual partners, what does it mean?\n\nF: Everyone you've ever had any type of sexual relations with, be they vaginal, anal or oral I need you to sum them up and put that number there.\n\nG: But.. Like my actual sexual partner? I just have one boyfriend now.\n\nF: If he's the only person you've been with, then put down a \"one\". If you've been with other people before, sum them up, and write down the total.\n\nG: But i only have one boyfriend now\n\nF: Yes, I understand that, but I need you to put the number of all the sexual partners you've had, throughout all your life. Not just your current partner. \n\nG: So, like, all my boyfriends this last year?\n\nF: Have you only been active for a year?\n\nG: No, I've been having sex for years\n\nF: Well, I need you to include all your partners, starting the count when you first became sexually active, up until your current boyfriend. \n\nG: But... Do you mean that you need all the people I've had sex with this last year, or like, the last six months?\n\nF: (thinking about smashing her face against the desk) I need you to sum up ALL the people you've ever had sex with. All of them. Think of the first time you had sex, that's partner number 1. Then the next is number two, and three, and so on\n Keep counting until your current partner.\n\nG: So... Not just during the past year?\n\nF: No. Not just the past year. We need you to include all of them, all the people you've ever been with, regardless of when it was.\n\nG: Hmmmm. Ok. (Walks away)\n\nEventually G returns with another doubt. She doesn't understand what they mean by listing an emergency contact. \n\nG: Like, my number? \n\nF: No, not your number.  If there's ever an emergency, who should we call?\n\nG: Me, no? I should just put my cell, right?\n\nF: No, honey. If there's an emergency, while you're here- If YOU have an emergency, who should we call to tell them?\n\nG: So, not me? Someone else?\n\nF: Yes\n\nG: Well, maybe my boyfriend? \n\nF: Ok, just put down his name and number. \n\nG: His name is John. \n\nF: Ok. Just write it down.\n\nGirl writes down \"John\" and hands over the papers\n\nF: I need his full name. Not just his first name. And I need his number too, or we won't be able to call him...\n\nG: If you need to talk to him, he can just come in with me next time, or call me and I'll tell him.\n\nF: I need his number, in case there is an emergency while you're here and he isn't, and you can't call him for some reason.\n\nG: Ok. \n\n\nIf this girl does exist, I don't understand how she's still alive.",

        "text": "Sorry, never posted before and I'm on mobile.\n\nSo I've been working at a local veterinary clinic since I was 14 (glorified kennel cleaner) because my uncle works there as one of the four vets. We do have a host of vet techs and front-desk-ladies who are also techs. Two years ago my uncle got the ownership of the clinic handed to him, and I was finally old enough to be an \"unregistered assistant\". I can do meaningful stuff - but there's a lot I'm not legally allowed to do. I'm very shy about people (yay working with animals!) so I tend to stay in the back. Away from pushy clients.\n\nThat said, the clinic shuts down late at 6:00 but the unlucky few stay behind for a longer time making sure overnights are okay and locking up the doors. I'm out front fussing with the charts for tomorrow's surgery and enter a shady looking man and a shadier looking grandfather. The man is holding a lovely white Persian in his arms straight out in front of him like he's holding a bag of garbage with the expression to match. \n\nMe: Ah, uh....we're closing down...\n\nThey keep advancing and plop the cat down on the counter. (Note that the counter completely wraps around and you cannot get behind it without going into the dental room.) \n\nMe: Oh. Okay...how can I help you?\n\nMan: I need to get Comfortis for my cat! \n\nGrandpa: It's got fleas.\n\nThis cat looks show-ready, not in the least flea'd. But okay, maybe it does have them. This doesn't change the fact that I'm not allowed to give out medications without an exam.\n\nMe: I can't help you with that, sorry, but I can get Jessica to sign you up for an appointment? If you like? \n\nMan: NO. Go bring it out right now!\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but we cannot sell any Comfortis without an exam first. It's the law.\n\nAt this point, Shady Grandpa starts leaning in toward me with the most severe glare I've ever seen. Shady Man slams his hands down on the counter and looks ready to vault over it. Persian kitty doesn't care about any of this.\n\nMan: I don't give a shit about the law! I've been coming here for years and I've never had to get an exam for Fluffy's* Comfortis!\n\nI'm right scared, because nobody is coming from the back and for all I know they left already, the room's lights are almost all dark, and Shady Man is yelling. But! I can pull his chart and see if he's had an exam within the past two months - he can buy his flea meds if so.\nSo I get his chart and surprise! He's not been in since 2006, and the only animal on file is a boxer under the same name as the cat. Well...\n\nMe: You don't seem to have Fluffy on file at all.\n\nGrandpa: Bullshit.\n\nMe: ...I think, maybe, that you really do need an exam. Please leave and return during business hours tomorrow so one of our doctors can properly check over Fluffy and prescribe you the right flea medication.\n\nObviously, the wrong thing to say. Shady man just goes off, yelling about how I should break the law, because \"the customer is always right\", Fluffy needs the Comfortis, I am terrible, and he's going to report me to my boss to get me fired (good luck without my name). I manage to speak when he pauses to breathe, but it took a bit.\n\nMe: If I sell you this, I will be arrested.\n\nGrandpa: It doesn't matter! You should be arrested for not selling us what we want.\n\nWhat? I honestly had no idea what to say to that. Luckily, Shady Grandpa's last shout finally got Charlotte's (a very large and scary old lady who helps us with checking overnights) attention from the back. She ran them off, somehow. I couldn't get over being told I should happily let myself be arrested over cat medicine.\n\n*not the cat's name. I forget what it was.\n\nEdits for formatting?\n\nTL;DR Shady Men want controlled medicine without an exam after closing time when I'm alone; I should break the law because the customer is always right.",

        "text": "To answer that question, I'm a white American: blonde hair, blue eyes, born and raised in California. But apparently I'm not American enough for one patient.\n\nI work at a gastroenterologist office doing reminder calls and scheduling office appointments, so I have many stories about angry people with butt issues. Here's one that happened just yesterday morning, while I was calling to remind patients of their appointments for next week. I'll refer to this patient as \"R\".\n\n&gt;Me: \"Good morning, this is kaffeinatedkelsey from Dr. C's office. Is this R?\"\n\n&gt;R: \"Yes.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Hello, R. I'm just calling to remind you of your appointment with Dr. C-\"\n\n&gt;R: \"What nationality are you?\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Pardon?\"\n\n&gt;R: \"What nationality are you?! I can't understand a damn word you're saying!\"\n \nI always speak slowly and pronounce my words carefully, because it is sometimes difficult to understand people over the phone. I figure this lady maybe has bad hearing (she's not that old, by the way - late 50s), so I slowed down even more and spoke a little louder for her.\n\n&gt;Me: \"I'm just calling to remind you that you have an appointment-\"\n\n&gt;R: \"What! Nationality! Are! You! SPEAK ENGLISH!\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"I'm a white American. I am speaking English. Are you having a hard time hearing m-?\"\n\n&gt;R: \"You're not white or American! I can't understand your accent, you lying BEANER!\"\n\nI realized I wasn't going to get anywhere with this person, so I just quickly told her, \"You have an appointment with Dr. C at [time] on [day], have a lovely weekend!\"\n\nI could hear her yelling some more as I hung up the phone, but she's no longer my problem. As far as I know, she's coming to her appointment next week. She should be aware of it because along with reminder calls, we also send reminder letters.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have the authority to ban patients from the office, and the doctor she's seeing wasn't reachable yesterday, so I couldn't bring it up to him. If this lady comes in next week, she's in for a shock because everyone in the front office is Mexican, and the doctor's medical assistant is black.\n\nAlso, Dr. C does not put up with racist patients. He's kicked people out before for being racist toward his medical assistant, so if this lady comes in and behaves that way he *will* kick her out in front of everyone.\n\nI gave the medical assistant a fair warning. She told me to bring popcorn.",
