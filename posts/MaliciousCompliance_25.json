        "text": "LTL FTP, on mobile, blah.\n\nI work at a big Midwest grocery store in produce, and we recently had a major change in a section of our department. Specifically, our salad bar was transferred over to deli, and it’s caused a whole host of problems that we really should have expected, but didn’t.\n\nA bit of backstory for this malicious compliance: Three months ago, the close for the cheese shop + olive bar fell ill and had to leave early. When the closing manager asked deli to shut it down it for her, they flat-out refused. So my manager (Adam) turned to me to close it up and wash the dishes. I’m the only one outside of deli who knows how to do it, so I was happy to help. (I love cheese, as well as the people in the shop.)\n\nWhen I came in the next day, it was to find that I was in major trouble. I was told that if I abandoned my post and helped another department like that again, I would be written up and disciplined. All right. Sounds good.\n\nSo, salad bar switched over to deli. The problem is that deli doesn’t want to do it, which means nobody is tending to the bar 99% if the time. Nice. Last week, they didn’t even schedule anyone for it, and another one of my managers (let’s call him Daryl) came to me. He told me that I would need to work the bar during my shift and leave produce every 45 or so minutes, even though I was the only person working our green rack and it was a busy day.\n\nThe problem is, I was told three months ago that I’m no longer allowed to abandon my post and help other departments. And seeing as how salad bar is deli’s now, and not mine, I unfortunately can’t touch the bar. After all, Daryl, you wouldn’t want me to get a write-up again for something a manager told me to do, would you?\n\nHe wasn’t pleased, but I didn’t have to work the salad bar.\n\nTLDR: was told I was no longer allowed to help other departments, and when I was told afterwards to help another department, I helpfully reminded them that they told me I couldn’t anymore.",

Often times this occurred back-to-back. \n\nNo matter how many times this happened, some nurses never figured out that you couldn't book an incoming patient for an outgoing patient's bed because the same ambulance crew would be doing both patient's with the same stretcher. \n\nNormally I would calmly explain this to the nurse making the mistake until they got it. Other nights I needed a nap.\n\n**Cue malicious compliance.** \n\nMe (tired from running back to back calls all day and night): \"Where do you want this this one?\" Pointing to the drunk sleeping on my stretcher. \n\nNurse: \"Hallway C.\"\n\nMe: \"We're taking Hallway C out to Other Hospital.\"\n\nNurse, without looking up: \"Put him in once Hallway C is empty.\"\n\nMe: \"We are loading Hallway C after we unload this guy. We are the transport for Hallway C.\"\n\nNurse: \"Okay. Put him in Hallway C after that crew gets here and takes him.\"\n\nMe: \"We're never going to get here. Where do you want us to wait?\" \n\nNurse, looking down the hallway: \"Hallway B is empty. Wait there until Hallway C is gone, then put him in Hallway C. We don't have any extra beds right now.\" \n\nMe; \"Got it. Sign here.\" I looked at the ER Doc. \"Cool?\"\n\nER Doc, grinning like a child: \"Cool.\" \n\nWe wandered down to Hallway B and took a 30 minute nap until the nurse came down, woke us up, and asked us what the fuck we were doing. We didn't even have to defend ourselves. ER Doc told her fuck off, that we were doing what she told us to do, and that if she didn't like it then she should pay attention. \n\nER Doc started off as an ambulance driver in the same company.

        "text": "During my final year of university, I lived in a room in the main court of my college grounds that was often frequented by the college cat, owned by one of the professors. I never found out her real name, but I always called her Scribbles. She would often spend entire days (and nights!) hanging out in my room; I loved having her round and grew quite attached. The cleaner who cleaned my room was also in love with Scribbles, and would sometimes bring treats for her to snack on.\n\nBut then the cleaner went on holiday, and someone else came to replace her. The new cleaner evidently didn't like the idea of there being a cat in my room, because the very next day there was an email from the college administration: \"Animals, such as cats, are not permitted to be in students' rooms\".\n\nI was upset by this email, but Scribbles was more so. Whereas previously I had left my door ajar so as to allow her in whenever she wanted, now my door was locked, and she would spend hours clawing at it and mewing to be let in. Whenever I wanted to leave my room, I had to be careful not to let her dash past me when I opened the door - and that gave me an idea.\n\nThe next day, in the morning, while the cleaners were doing their rounds, I stayed outside my door with Scribbles - playing with her, giving her all the attention she wanted. Everything short of actually letting her in. \n\nOnce the cleaners had almost arrived at my room, I parted with her and went to breakfast. My cleaner came up the stairs to see a cat scratching at my door, begging to be let in. And, of course, when they let themselves in to clean the room, she would have bolted in ahead of them. Knowing Scribbles, it would not have been easy to convince her to leave my room once she was in there.\n\nThe following day there was another email from the college administration: \"To clarify our earlier email, animals are not to kept *unsupervised* in students' rooms, or kept overnight\".\n\n\"Well\", I thought to myself, \"I can live with that\".\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhotos of Scribbles are [here](https://imgur.com/a/hFaQvov)",

They say it's for \"data collection\" but everyone hears \"covering our asses for an audit, so stop abusing our charge number\". Most people are pissed because this adds another layer of complexity and a lot of time when doing our timesheets and is in general very irritating.     \n  \nSummer is slow and a great time to knock out training. I had a few slow days in the past few weeks and did about 20 modules. When reporting time, typically we round up to the hour or half hour for simplicity. But no, not I.

        "text": "So this didn’t happen to me specifically, but it did happen to my coworker.  For our job, we drive a vehicle 24/7, and have to get the vehicles back on the road as soon as we can if there’s ever an issue.  Mind you, my work just invested in brand new vehicles and the one in this story has all of 2k miles on it.  So rewind to Saturday morning when a coworker blew a tire.  Our boss comes out to help him change it and so does another coworker.  \n\nMy mechanically competent and fluent co-worker began to jack the vehicle up using the designated jack location just behind the blow front left tire.  At which time, the supervisor barked at him, telling him that’s not how you do it and took over.  \n\nAs the supervisor began to jack the vehicle the mechanically competent co-worker realized that he didn’t have the jack on the frame and that it wasn’t going to work correctly and possibly damage the vehicle.  The supervisor then told him he was wrong, said that he had always jacked the vehicle from this spot and that the coworker was actually the one that was wrong.  \n\nOut of frustration, my coworker became compliant, said, “okay, do it how you see fit, but I’m leaving.”  \n\nAfter a few minutes of the supervisor cranking down on the scissor jack they got the vehicle up enough to get the tire off, and within moments the vehicle fell to the ground and landed on the rotor.  \n\nAfter another coworker brought over a floor jack and they were able to change the tire, the supervisor cleared the car to be driven.  \n\nNote:  after arriving to work the next day to see the vehicle, it was apparent that the supervisor had used the sheet metal/floor board as the jack location and after the tire came off, the welds broke and put a crater sized dent into the floorboard.  So we’re unsure of the cost of repairs at this point, but the floor is quite jacked up!  \n\nIn addition, this isn’t the first time this same type of vehicle had been dropped off a jack by the same person.  Specifically the same situation, same tire, just a year and a half ago.  ",

        "text": "Working in IT, you have to talk to a number of other groups with different responsibilities to get information to do your job. If you need IP addresses; things that make computers talk to each other, you have to talk to engineering. If you need to make a change to peoples stuff, talk to operations.\n\nManagement had a meeting, and decided they didn't approve of IT groups informally going to other IT groups to get information. Thus the new guidance was handed down that \"You must request permission prior to contacting engineering. Here is who you can contact for permission\" On this list was three names and a distribution group of who knows how many other people. We were also given the direction that \"You may not circumvent this guidance by going to talk to the individuals in person, or by leaving notes on desks.\"\n\nThe problem is I had roughly 15 tasks that required direct communication with engineering to complete. Wanting to make sure I didn't shoot myself in the foot, I asked the management group if each individual task had to require permission, or if one time permission could be given for a group of tasks. To my malicious glee, they said each individual task would require approval via email.\n\nSo I started slowly, I sent one email requesting permission to contact engineering on subject A.\n\nFive minutes later I sent two emails after each other requesting permission to contact engineering on subject A.1, and A.2. Similar tasks that require subject A approval, but still separate requests.\n\nI waited for twenty minutes, and had not received approval for any tasks. Not wanting to waste time letting them read and approve a single request one at a time. I decided to get all tasks approvals sent out at once.\n\nI was up to ten emails in five minutes when I was called by project manager and asked to stop sending any more mail. I let them know I would be at a work stoppage until I received approval for the items I had already sent. They said they would call management to see if they really wanted this process on single approval for items. \n\nI got an email half an hour later stating only approval to contact engineering is required within project scope, not each individual task.\n\ntl/dr: Management wanted to micromanage, so they got macro emails.

The team leads don't like this term, they find it demeaning. AVP asks them what they would like to do about it and they say \"Let us decide a name!\"\n\nSo at the next all hands meeting, AVP interprets \"us\" as everybody in the department, and we spend a few minutes thinking up fun names for a group of senior staff, then vote. The team leads are now known as \"The Sixpack.\"\n\nYou'd think they would have seen this coming when we named our accomplishment acknowledgement board the \"S.O.B.\" (Shout out board).",

        "text": "Gather round friends, and let me tell you a ~~tail~~ tale of *nasty* revenge. On mobile....anyways. \n\nSeveral months ago, I dumped my crazy ex, who immediately began stalking me, and spinning all manner of lies to make herself the victim. \n\nShortly before this, I had rescued a puppy from some awful conditions. We'd had to shave her to get all the fleas off, I'd had to de-worm her, and the poor thing had practically explosive diarrhea (this is important). She was also the runt of the litter, which is why I chose her to rescue out of the litter. I unfortunately could only take one, and she seemed like the least likely to survive in the conditions she was in. I borrowed a dog crate from my then-girlfriend's sister, promising to give it back as soon as I had found the puppy a loving home. \n\nWell...the very first night, the poor puppy puked and shat *all. over.* that crate. She had also spilled her water into her cup of puppy food, and dumped that into the mess. Bath time was had, but I set the dog crate in the backyard until I had time to clean it. Between work, caring for the sick pup, trying to find a new home for her, schoolwork, etc....and my own laziness, I'll admit....the crate just didn't get clean. It sat outside, rain or shine, still full of nastiness. \n\nFF to a week or two after I dumped my crazy ex, I get in contact with her sister (who I borrowed the crate from), to beg her to talk some sense into my ex so that ex would leave me alone. This was a terrible idea, in hindsight, her whole family is batshit insane and I shouldn't have expected any level of reasoning from any of them, much less that she side with me over her sister. The reaction was essentially (practically word-for-word, really) \"ex can do whatever she wants. Bring back the dog crate right now or I'll be at your house on saturday with the sheriff.\" \n\nI wasn't intimidated in the least. No sheriff is gonna take time out of his day over something as dumb as a dog crate, which I was perfectly willing to give back. And I'd told them I would give it back, as soon as I had time to clean it. \n\nThis, however, was when I decided I'd had enough of playing the nice and reasonable person. I'd told ex that if she could give me space, maybe we could be friends after a while. Instead, she stalked me, talked shit about me to anyone who would listen, and showed up at my job (a difficult task for her, without a car and several miles from the location). I'd reached out to someone who I had hoped would be more reasonable, and was threatened. They want the dog crate? They can have it. \n\nSo i went outside and shoved the disgusting, crusty thing (probably filled with ants), into a trash bag. For good measure, I threw in ex's cowboy boots that she'd forgotten in my bedroom. Shoved that mess in the trunk, droped it off on their front doorstep for them to find in the morning. \n\nTl;dr: dumped my crazy ex, who started stalking me under the guise of needing a dog crate I'd borrowed, so I gave it back....full of bloody diarrhea, mushy dog food, and whatever else it accumulated while it sat outside for about a month.",

        "text": "I was just reminded of a malicious compliance I had when I was working at a pharmaceutical testing lab. Tldr at the bottom. \n\nFor some backstory, we didnt test on animals we actually tested finished product drugs. This means each lot of drug needed to meet regulatory compliance via the USP, EP, JP or any other regulatory group in order to be sold anywhere. We did this by basically exploring any component of making a drug from raw materials to finished products. My job specifically was to test for the purity and activity of the active ingredient which was a very dangerous and stressful job. Active ingredients are usually a very tiny percentage of the finished product and is the actual part of medicine which makes you feel better. As such there wasnt much room for malicious compliance when it came to clients or working with other employees. However my boss was awful. \n\nHe would purposely schedule things that we wouldnt be able to do to meet client orders and promised clients super fast testing times that were extremely hard to meet. On top of that he has a bit of a god complex where he was always right no matter what. And he knew everything always. \n\nWe had a ton of training to keep up with in order to keep our licenses to do our jobs. In fact I was in a classroom learning something about once every night. I say night because I was working 2nd shift (3pm to 11pm). Well it was the beginning of my shift when my boss told me that I would be training on Karl Fischer (determines water uptake percentages of drugs). Thats fine, it wasnt anything different to be training on something new every day. I went back to my desk to block out the time when I noticed it was scheduled for 5am (not 5pm). So I went to approach my boss and the conversation went as follows:\n\nMe: Hey (Boss Name), I had some questions about the training I am supposed to get tonight. \n\nBoss: Alright what is it. \n\nMe: Well I noticed the time was a little off it seems like it is a bit late and I will be getting alot of overtime. \n\nBoss: Look I know that nobody wants this training but it needs to be done. Your going to stay until it gets done. \n\nMe: I am not sure I would be able to since my shift started at 3pm. \n\nBoss: You will stay until I said you are done. You will be done after that training. \n\nMe: Yeeeeah but that training starts at..\n\nBoss: Stay until its done! I scheduled it, I know when it starts. A little hard work wont hurt you.\n\nWell Karl fischer training is a 4 hour session. Ok this isnt my first shift my boss made me work overnight. I was making $32 an hour and overtime pay would greatly help me so I was happy to go through with it. My boss was getting production bonuses from all of our hard work that he didnt feel like sharing with any of us and he gladly would tell us he didnt have to(even though other group leaders did share their bonuses with their group). But if we worked overtime he was required to give up the bonus to cover department costs if he spent more than the budget. \n\nI sent an email to get confirmation that I was not to leave until Karl Fischer training was over. My shift started at 3pm. So I stayed until the Karl Fischer training was over.... At 9am when my boss arrived. \n\nMe: Hi (Boss Name), Im headed home now\n\nBoss: what do you mean now?\n\nMe: Karl fischer training was scheduled at 5am and you said I couldn't leave until it was done so I stayed.\n\nAll he had was this shocked face and no response\n\nAnd then I left, when my shift arrived again I was pulled into the directors office where he asked who authorized my long shift. Aparently my boss was trying to cover his bum and told the lab director that I wasted company resources by staying so late. I simply showed the email and said I was told to stay until training was done. He had me go get my boss (who had a bit of a smug face on) and then close the door behind him. \n\nThe closed door didnt help because you could hear the director and him argue about how his scheduling was erratic and didnt take into consideration his workers. After that a different group leader was scheduling us.\n\nHe eventually was let go because he was having some people do very unethical things (as he was commonly known to do to cut corners and get money). But ill never forget the extra $640 I had gotten that pay period and his face when the department head told him there was no production bonus. \n\nTldr: Boss wants me to get training in a new technique and tells me not to leave until then. My shift starts at 3pm training ends at 9am. I get 10 hours of overtime costing him his bonus. ",

In an effort not to implicate anyone, I'm afraid I can't be more specific. \n\nNow to the story, so Steve works as a line-maintenance mechanic for an airline. On turnarounds we have to work alongside a lot of different people, cleaners, ramp workers, catering and ofcourse the flight crews. Usually people are friendly and everyone gets along nicely, but not on this particular day.\n\nSteve was sitting in the cockpit closing defects on the electronic log, and while busy signing off on his work, captain douche bag and his first officer appear behind him. At this point the pilots would normally greet you and ask if you're done with your work, but not CPT DB, who instead snaps out a \"Hey you! Get out of there\". Not at all flustered by this Steve drops what he's doing and shuffles out of the cockpit while giving a cheerful \"ok\" in reply.\n\nApparently CPT DB wasn't in a hurry to get to work, but instead decides now is a good time to brag about his golf game to the F/O who's clearly not intetested. The minutes pass while Steve silently hovers around the cockpit door. Finally the F/O suggests maybe they should get to checking the log, and actually start preparing for the flight. CPT DB grabs the elog, stares at it for a moment, whirls around and starts running his mouth at Steve.\n\n\"what the hell is this, how do you expect me to fly when nothing is done!? Look at this, all these defects and nothing is closed, yadayadayada..\" \n\nSteve just stands there listening quietly, waiting for the verbal barrage to end, and then just responds calmly.\n\n\"Well, I was in the process of closing those defects when you told me to get out. Now, would you be so kind and get out of the cockpit so I can finish my work?\"\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation both CPT DB and the \nF/O exit the cockpit and leave Steve to  his work. Upon leaving Steve noticed a very red-faced CPT DB and the F/O desperately trying to suppress a grin.\n\nEdit: fixed typos",

However as we upgraded our software if there were old files in the same directory the software would not function correctly.\n\nTo fix that I added a check during installation process which would alert the user that destination directory is not empty and would stop the installation asking them to clean the directory. Once clean, installation would proceed and finish.\n\nHowever this was not an acceptable installation behavior according to my manager. He wanted me to wipe the directory without prompting the customer. His logic being \"our customers know what they are doing!\"\n\nI refused stating that it would cause accidental disk wipes and if we wanted the installation to be more automated I can move the check to first step of installation. But he was adamant to remove the check and I was adamant not to. \n\nSo he takes me to our senior manager, basically to shame the new guy in front of the whole team. I put my reasons in front of them, get overridden and reluctantly agree to do what is told.\n\nNow, since I did not want to remove the check, i restructure my program so that adding the check back takes 5 seconds and ship out the current version of \"disk wiping\" software.\n\nNow we wait.\n\nA week into it, nothing.\n\nTwo weeks, first customer contact about this issue.\n\nThe week after, I hear my manager is getting his head chewed off by our largest customer when our software installation wiped their server's entire disk and they had to restore from backups.\n\nNext day my manager comes to me and says \"Hey can you add a check asking for a empty directory or giving an option to clear disk?\" I said \"Sure\" and 5 seconds later \"done\".\n\nYeah, I peaked too early in my career!",

        "text": "This is my first time ever maliciously complying with an employer before and my first time writing out a narrative in detail like this, so bear with me.\n\nI work for a company that is involved in record keeping. We are contracted out by many different facilities, so almost every employee has a commute to work and is spread out to several different locations. I started working with the company a little bit over one year ago, and when I was hired received a flat rate travel stipend per day. I have to go through several toll roads every day and drive upwards of 100 miles per day in my own vehicle, so I was pretty happy to get a stipend. The stipend honestly did not fully meet how much I ended up paying per day on traveling expenses, but I didn't mind because I was eager to work and happy with my position.\n\nThere is a woman in my company that I will call Jan. Jan has recently started in a position slightly above me and is from a different region than I am. She has been a slight annoyance to me recently because she sends the employees I oversee emails that have nothing to do with our sites whatsoever. Not a big deal, but I received an email from her recently informing me that I need to prove my travel expenses for me to continue to get my stipend. Basically, she and my boss are trying to cut corners by decreasing the amount of money that I get per day from my stipend.\n\nLet me remind you that I have had this stipend for over a year now with no problems whatsoever. Moreover, my company knows my home address and each location that I go to every day, so they should already have the requested information and know that they have been cutting me short for over a year. But if they want to know my travel expenses, then I will provide them with my exact travel expenses.\n\nI pulled out all of my recent records regarding my travel. I found out the exact average miles per day I drive and then converted that number to a dollar amount by using my car's average miles per gallon and the current price of gas in my area. I then figured out how much money I pay in tolls per day to the hundredth decimal place. This sum alone was already 25% over the current stipend I received for my travels, but I was not going to stop there. I then standardized all of my car's upkeep expenses to a per day value based upon the number of miles I travel solely for my job (e.g. $20.00 oil change every 5,000 miles when traveling an average of 100 miles/day for work would be $0.40/day).\n\nAfter compiling all of my travel expenses, my total average travel expenses per day summed to be well over 50% of what I was originally getting. After these calculations, I asked them for an increase in my daily traveling expenses. I have yet to get a response back, but it is going to be hard for them to offer any less than what I have just asked for due to my meticulous record keeping. I honestly would have been okay with staying at my current travel stipend as I get paid enough to cover the rest, but since my employers seem to think I am cheating the system, I will be happy to ask for a more accurate amount. :)",

It's not much but it was amusing to me so I thought I would share it. TL;DR at the bottom, sorry if the post is a bit long.\n\nContext to start: I was doing some temp work at the time and got sent to the \"Pandora site\" (aka one of Google's industrial places). My job along with like 13 other temp workers were to rip some batteries out of these metal containers for recycling. That was it, it was just labor intensive from how many totes that needed to be processed. And our team did well, we managed to streamline the process and we're going fast enough that we were outpacing the amount of batteries Google was sending via trucks. The Big Boss was bragging to us about it and that he was excited to have a team that is doing good and fast work. He looks good, we look good, it's all fine and dandy.\n\nNow, the thing about Google is that they are paranoid as hell. They have security checkpoints, they scan your retinas, they have metal scanners, all those goodies. Part of their security includes having multiple supervisors (if I remember we had the Big Boss and his 3 underlings that were our supervisors). They had one hanging around at all times, but they would rotate and go off doing whatever. They would escort us to our lunches or around the site in groups of 4 usually because we had smokers and nonsmokers for our breaks, so they would separate us.\n\nOne of the things we were informed before our work there was to always be busy. They don't care if it's sweeping the floor, wiping a table that's been spit shined already, or sweeping some more. The temp agency just wants you to always be looking busy even if it serves no purpose. Now that we have the context, we'll move on to the incident itself. Now enters one of those 3 underlings, we'll call her Power Tripping Bimbo, or PTB for short. \n\nI mentioned our crew was just absolutely powering through our battery units, so in the third week we're super ahead of schedule and lunch is about to come up. One of the other supervisors tells us to wrap it up because he has to make sure we don't hurt ourselves while we put away gear and batteries, and then he can escort the first group to lunch, and he really wants to go to lunch. PTB however is in the side office out of sight doing lord knows what and we have to wait about 5 minutes before we can go to lunch since we're waiting on her to escort us. So what do we do while waiting 5 minutes before lunch, with all our gear put away, and the floors being swept for the 20th time that day? The four of us chat a bit to kill the time. We figured we did well enough to warrant this. This was apparently our mistake.\n\nThis lady came out and when she saw us chatting it was like as if we had spit in her morning coffee and called her a whore. She power stomps over to us and starts screeching like we were about to get her fired for chatting while we were waiting on her. We try to explain to her that the other supervisor told us to put our gear away and said she would be out \"in a minute.\" But she was not having ANY of that backtalk. No ma'am, we were irresponsible lazy workers who should be grateful we even got these temp jobs that could turn into real jobs (spoiler: they didn't and wouldn't have anyway, they just say that to try and get you to work harder in hopes of getting moved into a permanent position). Some more context: Most of the temp team were men with 1 woman. This particular escort group was all men however, and PTB was an attractive blonde girl that looked like maybe high 20's in terms of age. Her stepfather was also the Big Boss, so she got her position because of the combination of the two factors.\n\nBasically she told us we were supposed to be working, stop talking, we're not getting paid to talk. And so that's EXACTLY what we did. Our little 5 minute walk to lunch we did not say a thing to her or talk at all. Before this in the previous 3 weeks the group had talked to her all the time and hell a couple even flirted with her. But now? All the men were not talking to this pretty girl. \n\nShe did NOT like that. I'm guessing she was used to adoration and attention, and suddenly this group of men wouldn't even look at her. All we said was \"Yes ma'am\" and \"No ma'am\" whenever she talked to us. And it didn't stop there. We didn't talk or even look at her during the breaks, any other lunches, during the start or end of our shifts, or when she was the one supervising us during our usual work. We spread the word about her while she wasn't watching us to our fellow temp workers and they all got in all this cause they didn't want to deal with that nonsense either.\n\nThis goes on for about 2 more weeks and she cannot stand it. At some point she says \"I don't like being a bitch but I'll do it if I have to\" and most of us reply \"Yes ma'am\" and continue with our work or break. Man, she was just livid and knew she could not bitch at us directly since we weren't doing or saying anything technically wrong while on her watch. Eventually she complains to Big Boss and a few days later, she's no longer supervising us or even on the site any longer. Big Boss didn't say anything but another supervisor who we were buddies with let us know what happened. We found out that Big Boss liked our crew a lot and did not want to deal with PTB's bullshit this time and chose to transfer her away so our crew could continue to work in peace and keep pumping out those numbers. That was extremely satisfying to know he valued our work a lot more than her stupidity.\n\n**TL;DR:** Pretty girl tells us to not talk, so we make sure to minimize all interactions with her, and the lack of attention begins to choke her like a fish out of water.\n\n",

        "text": "Back in the winter time, our IT department started going through major changes. This meant a change in management, and combining two short-staffed groups into one to hopefully make a full team that blended well together. The first person in the chain of command I report to is my Operations Manager, or OM. He was my OM when I first started full-time five years ago, but switched teams eventually because of a micro-manager, or MM. The team he joined was the one we merged with, and MM was moved to manage a different team.\n\nWhen he was originally my OM, he'd assign tickets to our queue but allowed us to pull as well when we were looking for work or the queue got extremely overloaded. This was discussed in tech meetings and both OM &amp; MM were okay with this. Once OM was no longer our manager, MM said she didn't have time to manage the queue and wanted us to self-assign and she'd only look through the queue if it got too overloaded.\n\nWhen OM came back to our team, he told us \"No self assignment, I'm going to assign all tickets from the queue.\" At first I was a bit skeptical about it and asked a former coworker who had worked with me when I first started. He said that sounded like something MM would do. I stayed open-minded though and found that his system worked if he stayed on top of the queue. He knew exactly what we were working on, and generally didn't overload us.\n\nNow that we're nearing the end of summer there's a lot going on at one time and the tickets just keep piling up as OM has been out the past couple of days. On top of tickets we have computer refreshes to do before classes start, and faculty computer replacements. I'm not being given much information on either of these projects, just hearing what others are working on, so I'm assumed I was going to handle the tickets. But I was never given direction either way, so that's given me a chance to catch up and close most of my tickets. I could pull more but instead I'm on Reddit, typing up this story.",

        "text": "I've been posting stories about my dad. A few folks asked for the story about how his housekeeper's husband ate his dog while he was stationed in Da Nang. It wasn't a malicious compliance story, so I posted it over in r/talesfromthemilitary \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheMilitary/comments/92xvl6/my_dad_and_mai_dog/\n\nIt also is not a real fun story. Hopefully the link works.\n\nHere's the *OTHER* dog story. It is a fun story. The malicious compliance is inadvertent but it sure did piss him off. \n\nDaddy did not do very well once he got home from Vietnam. He kept trying to fix his circumstances, rather than himself, because fixing himself would mean no longer consuming a wide range of intoxicating substances. One thing he tried was getting married. This was not smart.  To give you an idea of how very not smart this was, he didn’t meet the child this union produced until they were 18 and went looking for him. \n\r\nBut he tried for a while. I can’t guess at what his first wife's issues were because I don’t know her, but Daddy's problem, other than Da Nang, booze, and being a nuclear level asshole, was that he had no chill. \n\r\nTwenty years later, dad had chill. The first time we watched The Big Lebowskey, my brother turned to Dad and said “We are watching the inside of your head\", and dad nearly fell off the love seat because my Dad was absolutely a very slightly more motivated version of the Dude. But he earned that chill through decades of having to be sober during weird shit, and he had not even started to develop it back when he and his first wife were married. He was a jagged raw bundle of nerves, and his wife's first attempt to heal that was to get daddy a dog. \n\r\nDaddy likes big dogs and he likes working dogs. He spent a lot of time with the K-9s on the base. When I was about eight he brought a great Dane puppy home, looked my mother in the eye and said “Honey, the breeder said he wouldn’t get that big.” (it did). Plus it had been a few years since the Mai Dog incident, so when the wife said she wanted a puppy, he figured he was ready for a new dog. What he wasn’t ready for was the long haired weenie dog his wife brought home. \n\r\nHe probably could have adapted if the dog were responsive to training, but generations of inbreeding had erased every trace of working dog in this animal's genes. You picked it up and the few brain cells it had rattled like maracas.  But he figured he could train it and be kind of happy with it for the wife's sake. At least he could be confident he wasn’t going to come home and find it cooked up with an apple in its mouth. The tiny bit of meat on it totally wasn’t worth it. \n\r\nSo he tried to begin by training it to do its business in one little spot in the yard.\n\n ...and then he tried to train it to do its business *anywhere* in the yard. But the tiny shred of gray matter this dog had only wanted to poop on their porch. After months of battle, dad had to admit the war was lost, and he covered the porch with newspaper. Slowly, he removed one sheet at a time and got the dog used to pooping on just the paper. The dog managed, somehow, to understand this request and complied. \n\r\nThen Dad pulled the last surplus piece of newsprint and left the dog with one square of paper to work with. He felt pretty proud of himself…until the dog began shitting six inches off the paper. Every. Single. Time. He'd come out and there's a little brown curl of poo sitting right beside the paper.\n\r\nDaddy eventually got so mad, he wanted to call his housekeeper's Papasan back in Vietnam and get recipe ideas. He couldn't punt it like a football because the wife would murder him, so he just kept trying to train the untrainable. And then finally, one day, he caught the dog going out to do its business. He could finally see what the problem was. He watched as the dog squatted up to do the doodoo that dogs do. \n\r\nWell, the *front* feet were on the paper, but damn if that weenie dog's ass wasn’t six inches from the edge when he finally dropped his load. \n\r\nAnd that's how the dumbest animal on the planet broke my daddy. \r\n",

For those of you who aren't well-versed in cast iron cookware, it means that I put some serious time and effort into properly seasoning this pan and making nearly as non-stick as Teflon.\n\nFlashing back two years, my father stayed with us for about a month, during which time he used my beloved pan to cook some breaded chicken cutlets AND PROCEEDED TO ATTACK IT WITH A SCOURING PAD AND DISH SOAP. After that didn't work, he SOAKED IT OVERNIGHT IN THE SINK when we were away one weekend. I nearly cried, but hey, family, so I stripped my poor pan down to its finish and started over.\n\nAfter the violation of my cookware, my boyfriend got a serious directive from me:\n\nDO NOT WASH MY FARKING CAST IRON.

        "text": "I've been watching this sub for a while now and always wanted to contribute but could never think of a story to tell. Well, I finally remembered one and I think it fits.\n\nLast year I attended a three day racing school at the infamous Skip Barber Racing School, not long before it went backrupt and was bought up again. The school took place at Atlanta Motorsports Park, which is a newer track about an hour north of Atlanta, Georgia. This is an amazing race track which is very flowing with a lot of elevation change, so it's really a drivers dream. However, the first turn is one of the scariest turns I've ever dealt with. It comes off a very fast front straight and right at the braking point the track drops off dramatically into a very tight 110 degree left hand turn which is off camber so the car wants to go to the outside of the track.\n\nNow I have quite a bit of racing experience, by then I had been racing go karts for nearly seven years, longer than I had my driver's license. But as I discovered, driving a kart and driving a car at the limit are two very different prospects, but a lot of the same principles apply. Needless to say I was a bit more advanced and a lot more cocky than most of my other classmates.\n\nOne of the first lessons and exercises we had was shifting and braking which only used the first part of the main straight, turn 1 like I described earlier. Now, we didn't use the full length of the straight in this exercise to keep speeds down, but those of us who weighed a bit less and really pushed it could get into third gear before getting on the brakes which was probably in the range of 50-60 mph. Like I said, the first exercise was shifting and braking, shifting being a simple enough concept especially since the cars had sequential gearboxes which meant to change gear all we had to do was lift off the throttle momentarily while we pulled the shift lever towards us and then get back on the gas. It's about the easiest form of shifting after flappy paddles.\n\nThe braking exercise was more challenging though. For the braking exercise we were to practice threshold braking, which is were you brake the car in such a way as to be at the razer sharp edge of adhesion, almost locking up the brakes but not entirely. In most cases this is the fastest way to stop a car as all of the braking energy goes into actually slowing the rotation of the wheels rather than relying on the friction of the tire on the ground to slow you down. The principle itself is easy enough to understand and sounds like it should be easy to execute, but within the process of bringing the car to a slow lies the challenge. The brakes of a car work based off a force of pressure, a pressure which is translated from pressing your foot on the pedal into the brake caliper which presses the brake pad into the brake rotor, which causes friction and slows the rotation of the wheels. However, at the limits of the adhesion of the tire on the ground surface, the force required to slow that wheel is not a constant at every speed, in fact the slow you go the less force you need to extert to slow that rotation, so the less pressure you need to put on the pedal, thus the term threshold braking as you are braking on the threshold of traction. In fact, if you are truly threshold braking and keep a constant pressure on the brake pedal the tires will lock up anyway because you are exerting more force into the slowing of the wheel than the tires can handle, and all that possible braking is lost and you are now effectively a passenger unless you reduce the force on the brake pedal. It's an action that is entirely backwards to your brain because we are instictively trained to brake hard if we aren't stopping fast enough, when its the exact opposite you should be doing. Wow, that is a lot of background knowledge on the physics of braking that ultimately has little consequence to the story but hopefully it helped some of you visualize.\n\nOnto the MC. As I mentioned early due to my past experience I was already a few leagues above my other classmates and was pretty good at handling the car. Needless to say I wasn't scared once I was behind the wheel, so I wasn't afraid to push it as hard as I could into the first turn for this practice. Outside of the car I may have been on the verge of throwing up because I was terrified at the idea of wrecking the car because I would have to pay for it, but once I was in the seat I was fine. Anyway, I would come barreling into the first turn before braking as late and as hard as I could, and a couple times I executed it perfectly, but just as many times I would overshoot the turn enough that if we had actually been lapping the track I would have completely missed my line. I knew I must be doing something wrong, but didn't know if I was just missing my mark or still not braking hard enough. So after the first session I went up to the head instructor and asked for some advice. I expressed my thought process but he wasn't convinced I was braking hard enough.\n\nSo I tried braking harder and harder and harder on the second session, but each time I came up to far. Heading into my last run down the straight he got on the radio and told me he wanted me to lock up the car just to make sure I could actually get enough force on the brakes to lock them up. Now I was getting more and more frustrated up to this point because I could not get this down, so I planned to follow his instruction to the tee. I took off down the straight as hard as I could and once I got to the brake marker I slammed on the brakes as hard as I could, locking up all four corners of the car, sailing off the edge of the track in a cloud of tire smoke and missing crashing head on into the tire barrier at the end of the gravel trap designed to stop cars from crashing by about two feet. I backed back on to the track did another hard stops off the racing line to dump any dirt and gravel like we had been instructed after going off track and came back into the pits. The head instructor didn't really say anything about it, but when everyone else questioned my about it I simply said he told me to lock up the brakes so I locked up the brakes, he never said to let off. Apparently the tire smoke was pretty impressive.\n\n**TL;DR**: Driving instructor told me to lock up the brakes on the race car, so I did.\n\nI should also mentioned none of this is meant to be negative towards the school or the instructors. The class and the experience was top notch and I was very sad to hear afterwards they were going bankrupt from outstanding depts.",

        "text": "Here's another story from my time working in the Seafood Department at the supermarket down under. Here's some previous stories\n\n* [Store Manager insists that he is always right, turns out he is wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8zjtl9/store_manager_insists_that_he_is_always_right/)\n* [Customer learns that employee of a supermarket won't try and upsell them](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/91x6pg/customer_learns_that_employee_of_big_supermarket/) (I fked up the actual on title on this one).\n\nThis is another story during close to Christmas. In case you didn't realise, Christmas in Australia - we eat (and therefore, sell) a lot of seafood. During this time, my department manager (DM) got temporarily transferred to another store in our region as a Assistant Store Manager (ASM). So we had to bring in a temporary DM. We usually start shipping in our frozen seafood stock around mid to late November to help with the expected rising demand over the December (and Christmas/New Years) period.\n\nIt was late November, the new DM (lets call her M - they got promoted from the Deli department) decided to start sell the frozen rocklobsters that we just started getting into the store. In case you didn't realise we typically sell the frozen rocklobsters at A$30/each these buggers weigh around around 300g, (which means that they would sell at $100/kg. M decided to sell the rocklobsters earlier that week (I typically worked the weekend shifts so i didn't realise, being a Senior Team Member at this time I typically help advise temporary DMs the inner workings of high-demand periods).\n\n**Me**: Are sure you want to put them out, people don't usually buy them onto closer to Christmas.\n\n**M**: Yes, we can sell them. They will sell out, trust me.\n\n**Me**: But you do realise, if we sell them we will have to dump them.\n\n**M**: Yes I do. I'm the DM here and you have to listen to me.\n\n**Me**: Ok...then....\n\nAs I was working the following day's night shift (because of food standard reasons, we typically have to audit the food every close up). I saw that the rocklobsters have been in the showcase for 2 days, meaning that, as you guessed it we have to dump it out. (We had 2, so we lost around A$60 -which wasn't that compared to what happened with the salmon with my previous story.) Before I left a night I wrote a note.\n\n&gt;Hey M,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Had to dump the rocklobsters. Please do not put any out next week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;jia0020\n\nIt turns out that even if we had reduced, no-one would have brought it. Previous sales records (from my store) have shown that rocklobsters usually sell well from early-mid December.\n\nSo next week arrives, and low and behold. M had decided to put out more rocklobsters and even some of our [Moreton Bay Bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thenus). This time, I simple ignored the fact that they were in the case, apparently on Monday night, we had to dump it out again (this time it cost around A$120). I texted my manager (same DM in the previous stories) about M's competence of not listening to me as well as M not using their brain for not looking at the previous sales and not thinking about when customers like to buy products.\n\nThis time the Area Manger (AM) and our ASM had a **\"nice\"** chat with the DM. In the end, M got demoted back to the deli position. And knowing that I was finished up final classes (in Year 11), my DM requested to get transferred back to our store/department just in time for the biggest sales of our department. We had sold 300% over the year's previous sales over the Christmas week.\n\nTo this day, I think M still hates me for ratting them out.\n\ntl;dr: Recently promoted DM doesn't listen to experienced team member and gets demoted back to their original position.",

        "text": "This one happened at my current employer.  Now keep in mind... I'm already checked out at this place because of our whole team being over-worked and under staffed.  The damns to give are few and far between.\nBut this one involved a fairly new co-worker (we'll call him Ryan), and I'll be damned if I let management start abusing him this early in his career.  \n\nSo Ryan is the new helpdesk guy.  He's the first to answer all calls, emails, tickets, etc. that come into our (very busy) IT help desk.  One guy, that’s it.  \nI'm supposed to be \"level 3\" but when management thinks front line support for 250 people can be done by 1 person,  I get to do more important things like show employees where their PC's power button is.  But that's not what this story is about.\nI should also point out our \"customers\" are actually just our employees.  We don't support external customers at all, just our internal employees.  \nRyan has just gone to his (legally mandated) lunch break, and my manager IMs me.  We'll call her Chad because somehow the name fits her.  \n\n&gt;CHAD:  A manager just called and said she saw Ryan walking to his car, and he's supposed to be helping her employee with their phone.  \nME: Yeah, it was his lunch time.  \nCHAD: Why did he go to lunch when he was in the middle of helping a customer?  \nME: Oh it was just an email.  I see here Ryan sent her a reply, and she didn't respond until after Ryan went to lunch.  It's just a softphone issue though, so she can still make calls using her desk phone.  \nCHAD: It doesn't matter.  He shouldn't leave when he was in the middle of working with a customer.  \nME: Well in his defense, we work like 5-10 issues at once so if we didn't just drop what we were doing at break time, we’d never get one.  We pretty much have to do that because of our workload.\n\n\nNow I thought this was pretty reasonable on account of us being over-worked as hell.  But apparently, this was the wrong thing to say.  Chad comes out of her office and walks up to me.  \n\n\n&gt;CHAD: If you're in an active conversation with our CUSTOMERS over phone or email, you should NEVER stop until you resolve the issue.  \nME:  Wait... seriously?  We do that on emails all the time.  We always have.  Nobody’s going to walk away during a phone conversation, but this was a fairly low priority email.  \n\n\nWrong move.  Chad becomes visibly agitated that I'm not just rolling over and taking her directions with a smile and a nod.  She’s a manager and what she says, goes.\n\n\n&gt;CHAD:  No.  We're not going to do that anymore.  You NEVER leave in the middle of helping a customer.  It doesn't matter if it's a phone call or email.  You need to stay with it until the problem is resolved.  Go ahead and finish the softphone issue that Ryan was working on and I’ll speak to him when he gets back.\n\n\nChad then turns and walks off without waiting for a reply from me.  I realize she’s new and probably doesn’t understand just quite how ridiculous what she just said really is, but it bothers me that she disregarded my input completely and she's treating us like we're cashiers.  This isn't a JC Penny, this is an IT department.  We don't serve customers; we serve the needs of the business.\nI start daydreaming up all the different ways this could go badly:  Labor law violations, massive overtime, huge backlogs since we’d be effectively waiting on a single \"customer\" to reply instead of working business-critical issues... But it turns out I didn't need to worry about that at all.\nI shit you not:  4 minutes later, I get an IM from the CEO's assistant, Jan.\n  \n\n&gt;JAN: CEO needs to listen to a voicemail ASAP, but he's forgotten his password. Can you reset it?  \n\n\nPerfect.  \n\n\n&gt;ME: I'm sorry, but I'm not available right now.  You can speak with my manager, though.  \nJAN:  Oh wow, sorry.  I’ll do that.  \n\n\nNow just as a clarification, Me and Jan are about as close to on-the-clock friends as co-workers could be.  She's on the ball and can read between the lines instantly.  She knows something is up because I'd never answer her IM like that, and I wouldn't be stupid enough to tell the CEO I'm not available because I'm with a \"customer.\"  \n\nNot even 2 minutes later, guess who shows up at my manager's door?  I couldn't overhear the conversation, but it doesn't take long before Chad is back at my desk.  \n\n\n&gt;CHAD:  So... the CEO needs his voicemail password reset.  \nME:  Okay, well I'm still working with the customer on this softphone issue, but a request from the CEO does sound pretty important to me.  \nCHAD:  Yeah...  \nME: So are you saying I should stop working this email and work on CEO's issue instead?  \nCHAD: Please.  \nME: She probably won’t get a response to her email until Ryan is back from lunch, though.  \nCHAD: That’s fine.  \nME: OK!  \n\n\nIt was never even mentioned to Ryan.  And that is probably the fastest I’ll ever see Malicious Compliance work its magic.  \n\nTL;DR:  \nNew manager treats an IT department like it's a retail store.  By shear luck, this impacts the CEO almost immediately.  Policy is reversed within 10 minutes.",

The relationship was on its last legs anyway and we broke up less than 14 days after I gave it to her. I wanted to return the necklace to the store. The necklace was in pristine condition and I had the receipt.\n\nI go to the store with the necklace and receipt and ask for a full refund as I no longer required the necklace. They said that they couldn’t do it and offered me vouchers. I asked why and at first they said it was company policy, I said it is statutory law in the UK that you have 14 days to return an item for a full refund, and that it also says that on the receipt. \n\nThey then said that that is only true if it is returned in a box. Now, I didn’t have the box. I said that isn’t fair because the box is just cardboard and isn’t worth anything. The shop assistant then went and got a manger, and the manager said the same thing. This necklace was quite expensive (relative to other things in the shop).\n\nHere is the malicious compliance: I asked the manager at this point, “what is the cheapest necklace you sell here?. He asked me why, and I said “Because I will buy that, take the box from that necklace, put this one in that box and return it to you.” The boxes are non-descript, don’t have a barcode or anything so it would be fine. The necklace I had bought was much more expensive than I knew some of their cheaper stuff was, so would have made sense anyway. \n\nThe manager at this point relented and said “Okay, well just do the refund”.\n\nI was happy, but would rather have not gone through that process.

        "text": "Picture: 4 teenagers, one of which being myself, having finished swimming. We are trying to shuttle one of us home, and our only licensed friend (J) driving. During this process, J asks me for advice on directions I would take. I tell him I know a way faster than his GPS is recommending, as J, despite always living in our city, relies on his GPS for directions.\n\nA bit of backstory. We live in a larger Canadian city, and this particular city is divided into four quadrants based on the diagonal cardinal directions. Street names and addresses are impacted by this, and there are duplicates. For example, our target is 146th Ave SE, but there’s also a 146th Ave SW. (None in NE or NW yet, but potentially in the future.) The city is also cut through the southern half by a quite large provincial park. This will be pertinent later.\n\nWe’re leaving, and as the honorary *Direction Man* by request, I clarify which address we’re going to, and start us on the path. Now, to save about ten minutes, there’s a road through the provincial park. The catch is, it’s occasionally locked by a gate. This was a chance I was willing to take, so I directed us through there, which my friend was glad to do. Unfortunately, the gate was locked.\n\nNo biggie, right? Extends our trip time by about 15 minutes, but nothing to lose your mind over, right?\n\nNot for J. He starts freaking out on me, something a little like this:\n\nJ: *It is your fault we’re running so late!*\n\nMe: *It was unlocked the last time I came this way. It doesn’t really matter that much. Sorry.*\n\nJ: *Shut your fucking mouth for the rest of it I’ll find the real way home myself.*\n\nMe: *K*\n\nNow you can probably see where this is going. He navigates us almost forty minutes away, and I clearly see him enter the Southwest location into his GPS. But my mouth is sealed. Once we arrive and he realizes he’s in the wrong part of town entirely, shit hits the fan. Our friends in the back seat start freaking out on him for shutting me down, the one who clearly knows directions, for making a simple unlucky move, but still knowing how to get there. But it’s not my fault. I’m just listening to the driver! We eventually get there, after ninety minutes of him trying to use his GPS for the true address, on a trip that would have taken us 20 if he let me continue directing.",

Led them to a free table with a bit of extra space for the dog and happy days.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later a family of 2 adults and 3 kids walks in. I organise a table and they sit down.

I tell her she is welcome to try to shut down the restaurant but we haven't violated any code.\n\nShe then changes her tune and says its not safe for a \"wild animal\" to be around her children (at this point the first table have overheard her).  I fully agree and ask her to leave and find a different restaurant. \n\nI don't understand why some customers go immediately to an extreme.

Being at work and on the clock, I chose to attend the meeting. Everything is fine, no big deal, right? No.\n\nMy boss IM's me a couple of hours later asking where I was and how the meeting was necessary or pertinent (maybe not necessary but definitely pertinent to my job). She asked me very directly and I almost thought she was joking, so I responded by telling her the meeting was informational and probably more necessary than going to a baby shower at work.\n\nAt this point she clearly gets upset and tells me I need to be more social with the team etc. I honestly can't believe she's sticking to her guns on this. I just told her ok but I was fuming.\n\nFriday comes along and there is a meeting I'm supposed to attend and present some content in (she is also on the meeting) but I looked for any possible reason to miss it. Turns out it's another co-worker's 5 year anniversary with the company. I quietly coordinated a late lunch with a few other members of the team smack in the middle of the meeting. I turned off my phone and had a very social lunch with my team and waited for the shitstorm when I got back.\n\nShe's actually WAITING AT MY DESK when I get back. She tells me she needs to talk to me and we go into a conference room. She's so crazy that she calls another one of my bosses into the room and directly asks why I missed the meeting. I laugh and tell them both I was being more social with my team like she wanted and then brought up the baby shower thing. The other boss just looked at her incredulously and shook his head. She stuttered through how it's not what she meant and just looked generally stupid.\n\n That really wasn't enough for me though, so I emailed our HR department explaining what happened and asking if baby showers were something I was required to attend. I just want to be super clear on the rules and expectations (;\n\nTL;DR Got told by boss that I should go to baby showers at work instead of meetings, did just that, boss looked dumb and will probably get in trouble.",

        "text": "*All names have been changed for purposes of anonymity*\n\nFor context, this is a big megacorp in the financial industry. \n\nSo this lady, I’m going to call her Susan, works for another department and commonly asks us for various data she needs for her work. The requests themselves aren’t usually impossible, but the timeframe she wants them in and her method of asking for it is the problem. Bear in mind that it is not in our job description to provide any services to her group at all. Any request she makes is something that we do as a professional courtesy with any time we can squeeze in our busy day. \n\nFirst, about a month ago, she asks one of my teammates for a bunch of data that would require mostly manually inputting thousands of data points. This was at about 3pm and the stock market closes at 4pm. He was busy trading stocks for our mutual funds in the stock market. Given that the market closed in less than an hour and he had millions of dollars worth of trades to execute, this was the priority. \n\nHe explained kindly to her that he would research her request and get back to her. She immediately responded by calling his supervisor to complain about him. \n\nSo she is a known quantity around our group and we know it’s gonna suck to deal with her every time.\n\nFast forward to this week, and one of my other teammates is dealing with her again. Let’s call him Bryan. Bryan is transitioning to another group so he needs to hand this off but is still kind of owning this request. Susan’s request was for Bryan to redo a report we issued last month that had a minor error in it. So Bryan requests me to redo it. Not a problem. Requires the better part of a day to do, but I make it happen. I send it to Bryan, and Bryan sends it to Susan while telling her to direct future requests to me. Remember that I was the one who completed this report. \n\nA few days later I get one of those further requests. She wants us to go back ANOTHER month to May and fix that report too. Fixing June’s report wasn’t too bad because we just basically had to redo it. But the tools we use to produce this report always overwrite the previous month’s data. Suffice it to say, without getting into ridiculous detail, reproducing June’s report is a lot simpler than reproducing May’s report, and reproducing June’s report was a bitch. \n\nSo I email her back and tell her I’m going to research how to do this and get back to her. \n\nShe emails me back and says “Phil, you should ask Bryan how to do this because he did it quickly for June’s report.”\n\nHere’s the thing. My first name isn’t Phil. It’s Bill. My signature from my email says William Phillips. I go by Bill mostly. She looked at William Phillips and somehow decided to call me Phil. \n\nI thought about telling her that it was I who wrote that report she’s referring to. How I’m very familiar with the report and as I explained in the first email there are legitimate reasons May’s report will be more difficult than June’s. I thought about sending that. \n\n*here comes the malicious compliance*\n\nBut hey, I’m Bill. And she didn’t ask Bill. She asked Phil.\n\nI’m going to wait a few days for Phil to respond.\n\nTLDR; Lady from another department makes demanding requests with unreasonable expectations, complains commonly, and then calls me Phil when my name is Bill in her last request. I’m going to wait a few days for Phil to respond since that’s who she asked for. ",

        "text": "As I mentioned in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/90mhu1/you_went_after_mama_bear_you_shouldnta_did_that/), sometimes contractors can be a bit shit about washouts.  And as bad as the ones who get all proprietary about *their* washouts can be, the absolute worst are the ones who don't bother to provide any washout, not even a wheelbarrow.  When that happens, the driver has three options.  \n  \nThe first is to just washout on the ground and hope they don't get caught.  This is a sub-optimal solution, as the fines for washout water reaching a storm drain can be $10,000; if it goes into a federal watercourse, it can hit $25,000 (and this whole valley is a checkerboard of BLM and reservation land).  You really only see this happen when the driver can wash out into an empty form (like an unpoured sidewalk) or rubble pile.  \n  \nThe second option is to scrape down the chutes as best you can, then make a mad dash for the plant where you can hopefully wash the concrete off the drum's fins.  If the plant is too far away, the concrete will get too hard and make a complete mess of the drum.  Drums can be chipped out, but we try to do that as infrequently as possible (i.e. once you have so much buildup that you can't hold ten yards without spilling) because that means turning the chippers loose on your drum.  Chipping a truck means crawling into a cramped, hot, damp, steel echo chamber, and firing up a jackhammer.  Chippers do this every night.  Chippers are more jaded than Liu Sheng's burial suit.  Chippers never bother to say something when they punch a hole in the side of a drum, rather leaving it to the driver to discover the following morning (hopefully before a bunch of concrete goes into said drum).  We do not scrape down unless we are near a plant and have no other option.  \n  \nThe third option is the bucket.  Most drivers have at least one five-gallon bucket somewhere on their truck.  If they have one that is not currently filled with the caustic witch's brew used to clean their truck, a driver can stick that bucket at the bottom of their chute, wash down a bit, carry the bucket up the ladder, dump the contents into the hopper, and repeat.  Imagine climbing a ten-foot ladder while carrying a good-sized medicine ball...about six or eight times.  It takes forever, is backbreaking and miserable work, and sometimes there is just no other choice...\n  \nUnless you are Bob.  \n  \nBefore Bob became our wonderful manager, he was a lowly mixer driver.  Bob was a driver for a very long time, and he started before they began putting automatic transmissions in mixers.  Between working the clutch and climbing in and out of his truck, Bob has completely voided the warranty on his left knee; the man totters around like a semi-corpulent Long John Silver (this is not an uncommon injury in the industry).  \n  \nSo, Bob is patching the [v-gutter](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b8a962d2b8571fbec4e0a4/t/58d1661ce58c621fc04ebb05/1509578451986/flowline.jpg?format=750w) at a storage unit.  When they finish the job, they've left his chutes packed with concrete, and they have no washout.  They don't even have a wheel barrow.  Bob has nowhere to scrape all that concrete out of his chutes, let alone wash down.  When he asks the foreman what to do, the guy just shrugs and says, figure something out.\n  \nBob is less than pleased.  It's considered bad etiquette to leave a driver's chutes packed like that; a good chute man will stop the pour a little short, then do a basic scrape down to fill the rest.  They are in the middle of the city, on an asphalt drive, so he can't just wash down uncontained.  It's the middle of summer, and too far to get back to the plant, so he can't make a run for it.  And anyone who thinks Bob is about to hobble up that ladder with a bucket full of concrete several times (before he even gets to the point of washing down into said bucket) is tripping balls like a drunken tanuki.  \n  \nBob does not get his Homer bucket.  Instead, Bob goes back to his cab and pulls out a big wad of pink plastic.  The air tanks on our trucks have petcocks on the bottom to drain water (water can precipitate out of compressed air as it cools, slowly filling the tanks with an incompressible fluid).  We don't really need them, since we work in a desert, but they give a ready supply of air at 120 psi.  He slips a rubber valve over the end of the petcock, opens up the tank and Boom! Bob has created his own washout, and it is absolutely fabulous.  \n  \nIt turns out that every fall, as the various stores began dumping their summer inventory, Bob wanders around town and picks up a few kiddie pools on some extreme discount.  Just to make his point, he always goes for the brightest colors and most garish patterns (occasionally he would even find a bootleg MLP knockoff or something sparkly).  When Bob has to make a washout, he makes the most awesomely eye-watering washout he can.  So Bob washes down into this pink crime against the visual arts, making sure to fill it all the way (if he had to pay good money for it, sure as hell he was going to use it), and he leaves.  He just folds up the chutes and gets out of there, leaving the kiddie pool sitting on the asphalt.  \n  \nProviding a washout is, ultimately, the contractor's responsibility (and, if they didn't order the job as a scrape down, their requirement).  So is disposing of the washout.  One of the reasons wheelbarrows are so popular for emergency washouts is because they are so easy to clean up.  After all, the whole thing is readily mobile, and, once nobody is looking, it can be wheeled over to any patch of dirt or lawn and just flipped over (sadly, I see this happen often).  That isn't the case here.  Watching someone try to move a full, inflatable pool without spilling is an instant cure for melancholy.  They are not rigid, and just about anything you do is going to dump muddy water everywhere (which then has to be cleaned up).  The only real solution is to leave it sitting there, in plain sight, until enough water evaporates that it can be moved without making a mess (and in this case, there was still at least 100 pounds of concrete to deal with).  \n  \nNow that he's manager, Bob makes sure we all have hideously pink wads of plastic shoved behind our seat.\n  \nTL/DR:  Contractor tells a driver to make his own washout arrangements.  Driver leaves contractor with a fabulous, pink, inflatable pool, filled to the brim with concrete and water.  \n  \nEdit: added link to [last week's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/90mhu1/you_went_after_mama_bear_you_shouldnta_did_that/), where I went into more detail about washouts.",

        "text": "This happened last year but since my plant is coming up on its busy season it reminded me of this blunder.\n\nI work at a food processing plant and between August and November is our busy season where we make tomato paste. The process for making paste is you basically repeatedly boil down the fruit until you boil out most of the water from it in a machine called an evaporator. These are aseptic systems meaning they are completely sealed from the outside after being sterilized.\n\nOne afternoon of making paste the CEO and COO came by giving some suits a tour of the paste production. They wanted to show off their new safety system by making us hit the master E stop for the evaporators. We can't do this. If the system stops the valves open and the stystem is no longer aseptic. If this were to happened we would lose 2 days of production to re sterilize the machines. After explaining this to these monkeys, and having the paste supervisor get into a heated argument about why we can't stop the machine like that the CEO and COO were not having any of it. So we relent and hit the E-stop. Cue all the valves popping and thousands of pounds of boiling hot tomato paste being expunged onto the floor. \n\nThe look of terror on their faces when we told them that this is a 48 hour cleanup still makes me smile. We haven't seen the CEO or COO in the paste yard since.\n\nTLDR: CEO and COO are fucking idiots.",

        "text": "I posted this in a comment somewhere else and someone introduced me to this fine subreddit by suggesting that I post my tale here. It's a pretty standard Back of House Service Industry story. Here goes: \n\nYears ago I worked as a server at a hotel and, like every BOH, there were a few genuine shitbags on the kitchen staff. One fairly quiet Sunday the whole gaggle of them was on without the chef or the sous (a rare occurrence, as these people could barely be trusted with the simplest services), and the leader of the shitbags went to my prep area to steal a bunch of my polished silverware (instead of grabbing clean silverware from a dish bin or from storage). I saw this happen, and asked him for the hundredth time not to take items from my prep area, and he laughed and walked away as if I was a friend who was simply giving him a hard time. \n\nAs he walked away he noticed there was a knife in the handful of spoons and decided that the best place for it was on the floor right on the back line, where he and a number of other cooks would be walking all day. \n\nI wasn't about to pick up the knife, but I also didn't want to see one of these idiots slip and hurt themselves. So I did what any sane person would do:\n\nI grabbed some computer paper and a marker, drew a picture of a knife on it with the words KNIFE ON FLOOR underneath, and taped it to a caution sign.\n\nFour cooks proceeded to spend the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon awkwardly navigating around this sign instead of picking up a single butter knife.\n\nWhen the sous chef came in that evening he asked around and eventually came to flip a lid on me. I calmly explained to him that his staff dropped the knife and ignored it for over an hour in a place where he and all of the cook staff insisted that no one but cooks should be, and that I had only put the sign there because I was concerned for the safety of his employees and I couldn't reach the knife without walking on his line. \n\nHe told me to go fuck myself and stormed away.\n\nI loved that job, and have a lot of great memories from working in the service industry, but this one is probably my favourite.",

It has a restaurant, fishing,  and hunting section to go along with the gas station.  It had just recently opened and was really busy.   \n\nI spent $75 and some change, and paid with a $100.  On the way out I realized that I got $10 too much change back.  I went back in to return the extra money to the cashier, and as i walked up he said \"the line ends back there\" in a very smart ass tone.\n\nI wait in the long line...When I finally get back to the cashier, I tell him he gave me the wrong change.  He immedialty blurts out that he gave me the correct change and starts to make a scene.  He cuts me off every time I try to interject.  Finally he tells me to leave and keep my change the way it is because it's most definitley correct.  At this point I'm tired of messing with him and decide to maliciously comply. \n\nI give up and say fine.  He finally quit talking long enuff for me to tell him his drawer is going to be $10 short because he gave me too much money.  His expression is priceless as I go out the door.  \n\nI live in a small town, and know the owner of the  business.  So I called him the next day, and told him what happened.  He told me that the register had come up over $100 short, and he was none too happy.  He was glad that I called because the cashier was trying to cover up his screw ups, and he even gave me a $20 gift card.",
