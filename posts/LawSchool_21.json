        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI apologize upfront if this post sounds whiney or dumb, but I am feeling very down. I am a 1L at a lower T-14, and I absolutely killed my first semester of law school. I ended first semester with a 3.9. That said, this has been a tough few weeks, and I am not feeling well at all.\n\nFirst, there is a job-search issue. My career services office told me that I would likely be competitive for a few 1L SA gigs. I have gotten a few screeners, a callback, but no bites. Now, I know that they are super competitive and it was stupid for me to get my hopes up, but I really thought my GPA would secure me a position. It makes me worry that either my interview skills (which I have been told are pretty good) or other materials are problematic. But my writing sample was the among highest in my legal writing class, and my other application materials were approved by the career services office. Now I feel like I have missed out on other opportunities that I should have applied for early, and I am worried that it will negatively affect my 2L summer employment.\n\nSecond, I participated in my school's corporate counseling competition today, which involves partners from a firm and a professor evaluating your group's approach to a complex legal/business problem. It is marketed as requiring no prior legal or business experience. But I have to say that after participating, I have never felt so dumb. Everyone in my group seemed to understand the problem pretty well, and they were able to propose intelligent solutions. I, on the other hand, could barely understood the prompt. Granted, everyone in my group is more interested in transactional practice than I am and therefore had a much better grasp of the financial terminology, etc. (which I know absolutely nothing about). But still, I looked like a complete moron trying to participate. My only consolation is that I am primarily interested in litigation, but I still feel the fact that I did not understand what was going on indicates a big problem, given that I want to pursue business litigation.\n\nAll-in-all, notwithstanding my solid first-semester GPA, I feel useless and stupid, and I am wondering if I have the smarts to do this job. I can't concentrate on studying right now because I honestly just feel like laying down and sobbing. Am I being completely irrational? What should I do? I am feeling very lost, and any perspective would be much appreciated.",

        "text": "Hey all, I’m a 1L (22M) and I’m having strong thoughts about withdrawing from law school. For starters, my peers are generally all older than me, all have some prior legal experience, or have friends to support them in their struggles to “catch up”. I have none of these things. I am the youngest in my class, coming straight off of my undergraduate degree. Where I graduated from was a quarter school, so I wasn’t free from classes until later June, only to begin law school early August. I had no prior legal experience going into law school, just several courses about law and the courts. To top it off, I have zero friends at school. The first day I talked to several people but wasn’t able to make any connections in my opinion. So I went the entire first semester without study groups or friends to relate with on assignments. Both in school and outside of school. I’m new to the city I’m in and have no one here.\n\nI got by first semester with straight C- and one C+. I felt as if it started out strong and then my effort plateaued and went off a cliff. Not because I was not interested, because at the time I was, but I just burned out. The burnout continued and I felt myself getting behind and barely managed to get passing grades in my classes/ finals. As it stands I ended with a 1.7 and need to bring it to  a 2.3 to be eligible to continue next year.\n\nI was told by a professor I should see someone about my struggles and I did where I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and insomnia. I began to take medicine for it and went home for break where I hoped I could get rest and go at strong for this semester. U fortunately, it’s so much worse and I just don’t know what to do. I stopped going to most classes, the dean has a meeting set because they are concerned. When I wake up for class I’m physically consumed by worry that I’m still behind, that I don’t know the material enough and that I will get called on by the professor and humiliated in front of the class. My vision goes white and my heart races until I just lay down and close my eyes. This anxiety keeps me up all night, not a minute of sleep, about 4 nights a week. So, it’s gotten worse. I’m not really going to class, I’be not even applied for any summer work, a month behind in my classes, and I’m consumed with dread. \n\nI just need advice, from people who have faced similar obstacles. If it were 100% an ideal world, I would withdraw. I need to do better this semester or they’ll give me the boot anyway, but I feel so much worse. My worries though are the following:\n\n1) I have a large sum of debt from undergrad that I need to pay off as well as this years law tuition. I don’t have a job lined up if I withdraw, but I have a bachelors so At least several doors are open. \n\n2) I value nothing more in this world than my relationship with my mom. I know she’d react poorly and I don’t want to make her mad or sad. I want to believe if I was honest about the toll this has taken on me that she would stand by me 100%, but Im worried. \n\nAny advice please and thank you.",

The other most expensive areas (D.C., Boston, L.A., SA, etc.) would require anywhere between $150,000-190,000 to match $235,000 in NYC. Now yes, I understand that NerdWallet's COL calculator isn't perfect, and the differences in COL could still be smaller by tens of thousands of $s but there is still a massive difference.\n\nSo I ask again. Is NYC, and to an extent, California Big Law a scam?\n\nSalary wise, are you better off being a mid law or regional Big Law lawyer in a sunbelt state making 130,000k with no debt?\n\nYes I understand the Cravath scale is absurd but very few people actually get to reap the benefits of this scale before they burn out and settle for a in-house job that will pay them less and still most likely in NYC.",

It’s a housing agency, and I eventually want to work in immigration— I just happened to have worked in housing previously which is why my advisor encouraged me to apply. It’s also unpaid and I’m being considered for a paid position in the same field at a different org. I honestly thought that interview went much better than this one, but they said they don’t make decisions till mid-March. \n\nIs a disorganized interview indicative of a larger issue with an agency?

If we have online textbooks are we allowed to use them during these open book exams? Or would I have to buy a physical book just for the exam?

        "text": "This is my last shot because I can't get solid advice elsewhere. I'm stuck between picking a course - I'm in last semester of 3L, no articling secured yet. I've got two slots and I'm struggling to pick between three courses: Wills, Insurance Law, and Labour Arbitration/Procedure. \n\nIf it were personal choice, I'd go with the labour course. The big downside is that it isn't useful - in my jurisdiction any firm that really handles labour has already hired students, and I don't stand a good shot of getting into that practice area. The average also tends to be a bit higher, because it's a small course. \n\nWills would be helpful bar prep, plus a lot of firms I've seen hiring recently have a full practice that does work in wills &amp; estates. \n\nInsurance law is of absolutely no interest to me, but a lot of places still hiring articling students do work in insurance defense (or personal injury/torts where I'm sure it'd be relevant). It's also one of those things that would be helpful for me to take in a course to fully get what some of the more technical concepts are. \n\nThe career office was not helpful at all in trying to navigate this decision - the general advice is to take what's of personal interest, but that doesn't feel realistic or practical. Any other thoughts on this?",

My career services is NOT helpful with J.D. preferred jobs or any alternative career paths so I am feeling really lost on where to go and how to get to where I want to be. I am extremely interested in policy, governmental affairs (private companies), politics, and to be honest any other job my legal degree can give me a boost on $$ wise.

        "text": "In the United States, people have the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt, right? So why is it that someone who is accused of something suddenly now has to “defend” something. My view is that using the word “Defendant” inherently places the obligation to prove innocence on the accused party, instead of it being, solely, the Prosecution’s job to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. I think the accused party should only be referred to as “The Accused” pre-conviction, and then can be referred to as a “Defendant” post-conviction. I think this is an important distinction to make because every time the jury hears “defendant,” they think about the actions that the accused party is ACCUSED of partaking in, not objectively analyzing the evidence being presented with the presumption of innocence. I think this distinction has also influenced society’s fairly negative view of the justice system, as it seems that all anybody has to do is accuse you of something, and now you’re responsible for defending yourself via financial burdens and time off for court appearances that a large swath of the population in the US simply can’t afford.\nIf this post is totally off base and there’s a legitimately logical and reasonable explanation for the use of the term “defendant” in the above-stated circumstances other than “that’s just how it’s always been,” please, try to explain it to me.",

        "text": "I’m currently a 1L and recently had my first (legit) interview on Tuesday for an internship/clinic position with an innocence organization that was the sole reason I decided to go to law school. I specifically chose my school because it offered the clinic, and ever since I first heard of the organization 4 years ago, my entire journey since then (although sometimes severely second guessed due to self doubt) has been meticulously planned so that I can get to this point and apply for the clinic. I applied, and wrote a cover letter that I was beyond confident in. My confidence was affirmed when a few days later I got an email inviting me for the interview. Knowing how competitive it is, my excitement and self-confidence was through the roof. On Tuesday, I had the interview, and although I was (almost debilitatingly nervous) I figured it couldn’t possible go poorly, as there was nothing I had to research, or BS, as I knew just being myself would show my passion more than my words could. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I had to ask them to repeat a question that was literally just asking me what I hoped to gain from the experience. And that was the FIRST question. That set the tone for the rest of the interview, where I’m not even sure I ever really answered their questions explicitly without going off track and talking about something completely irrelevant. It’s all I’ve been thinking about since the interview ended, and I was in hystericals after hanging up (it was on zoom) and couldn’t pull it together knowing that I just blew something I was THIS close to getting after years of tunnel vision and determination. I expect to hear back any day now, and I’m just preparing for the worst. I wish I could say I am just being dramatic, but I’ve never experienced such a devastating feeling. I spent my birthday yesterday preparing for the email saying that they couldn’t offer me a position, and I can’t shake this feeling. Any back up plan I had won’t suffice - I know what I want and that I have so much to offer them, and even though it is out of my control at this point, I’m praying for a miracle. I guess I just wanted to write this if anyone else was going through something similar because we all know misery loves company lol. But I’m all seriousness, I don’t see a future in law in any other sector, and I’d love to hear from anyone who has any words of affirmation or motivation for me. Thanks in advance &lt;3",
