I initially thought it might be one of the DUST films but having looked and been unable to find it, I might be wrong.  Please help...!\n\nThe film is probably not much more than five minutes long.  Live action with CGI effects.  The plot (such as a five minute film can contain!) is an arms sale between humans and aliens.  The humans are soldiers/mercenaries or smugglers, and the aliens are rather crustacean like (the reminded me of the District 9 aliens - the 'prawns).  The aliens are quite varied in their sizes from human-sized down to quite small.\n\n&gt;!Spoiler.  One side somehow betrays the other (I can't remember which now) and one of the smaller aliens grabs an explosive charge or grenade from the arms being traded and runs under the humans vehicle, where it blows up.!&lt;\n\nI've looked on my Youtube history, but couldn't find it there.  Maybe I found a link to the film hosted on some other platform, or I wasn't logged in to Youtube when I watched it.  I assumed it was one of the DUST films so I looked through a list of all the episodes but didn't find one that fitted the film I remember.  But given how many films there are on the DUST channel it is possible the list was incomplete or I just missed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?  Any help in identifying it would be appreciated.",

It has possibly been a decade since I read it so the details that I can remember are sparse. \n\nWhat I remember is that first contact with intelligent aliens happened at the edge of the Solar System where some humans told some aliens the location of Earth. The very next day an alien armada appeared with its weapons primed on every city on Earth. The Humans in the book had no choice, but to surrender and be enslaved. They would eventually be freed, but end up being enslaved again by a second alien race. Only to yet again be freed for good this time. \n\nThe most advanced species in the universe exist in a very interesting way. They spend most of their existence working on a way to send their race back into the past to when they are “created”. So they live in a sort of timeloop. It also means they only exist in the past because of their actions in the future. At least one human also exists this way. \n\nI don’t know if this was enough info, but I hope someone will recognize it.",

        "text": "This is a truly great Sci-Fi story that took eight years slogging through the 70s and 80s Soviet Russian publishing system before finally being published. Not since the *Southern Reach* trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer have I found a Sci-Fi story that  creates a truly unfathomable and creepy take on an alien encounter with human civilization. \n\n&gt;!In this case the enigmatic aliens have come to Earth and gone thirteen years before the start of the story. The reason for their visit is just as enigmatic and might have just been a brief stopover comparable to a human family stopping along a forest road to have a picnic before continuing on their journey. But like people leaving clutter and refuse where they stopped for their picnic, wherever the aliens touched Earth they created zones where the laws of physics and biology no longer apply. It is possible that the aliens were so advanced that as insects are to people, humankind was to them. Within these lethal zones strange alien objects lie strewn about; objects that scientists and non-scientists strive to retrieve in order to unlock their secrets. Even though it is illegal for individuals to enter the zones without permission, people known as stalkers, like the main character Red Schuhart, will risk their lives and prison terms in order to retrieve objects from the Zone for profit. This then is mainly the story of hard drinking, chain smoking stalker Red risking his life retrieving alien objects from the Zone in order to achieve security for himself and his family and ultimately seek meaning to his own human existence.!&lt;",

However, the \"punishing hand of power\" is no longer the police, which as such no longer exists. From now on, thenational army intervenes only in local conflicts and serious crimes, which are less and less. All the rest - dissenting, unworthy and inappropriate are being crushed by new economic technologies. With the complete withdrawal of cash from circulation, it's enough to set in zero accounts and block access to insurance, to make a person the nobody. \n\nAnd this came to be much more effective than previously known punishments, because in this case you can’t buy groceries in the store, or see a doctor, or take advantage of any other benefits of an overly developed civilization.\n\nHowever, a few criminals and dissidents manage to survive even in such conditions.\n\nAnd one of them is Wayne. And now he is racing on his electric bike to his home, where his sick girlfriend is waiting for him.\n\nIn general, they live in a beautiful place - practically on the banks of a wide river that splits the metropolis for two parts. \n\nTheir dwelling is underground, and it is a huge abandoned fuel tank from a gas station that was ago here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7frdjlbu1eja1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fba0e9f0fad0aaa32290d9432af7f70b68f8128a\n\nWith the settling of all transport to electric energy, petroleum products completely left the market. But pharmacology reached unprecedented heights and practically took biggest place in the economy. Now, when there are so many harmful factors around, everyone is just obsessed with maintaining their health, and medicine is the first assistant in this. From now on, medicines are made exclusively individually for each person, and state-controlled mega-corporations are doing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd in this world, Wayne survives. He is a modern medicine man. Well, to be more precise - a brilliant chemist, an expert in physiology and, perhaps, having unique flair.\n\nHe himself makes drugs in his home laboratory from available reagents, and these are cheaper and - often - more effective than the products of a mega-corporation. And more and more often those who either cannot buy too expensive drugs, or simply do not want to continue to feed this system, turn to him.",

        "text": "As a child, Jaxon always felt out of place. Despite growing up in a loving family on Earth, he always had vivid dreams of a different world. In these dreams, he saw himself as a leader, the first human on a planet that was not his own. He could remember a time when his people had to flee their home planet Mars, due to a catastrophic climate change caused by pollution. They had built a ship called ARK, filled with genetic materials from every species on Mars. They sent that ship to Earth to begin again.\n\nNow, as an adult, Jaxon had learned to ignore these dreams. That is, until he began to see the same signs of environmental decay on Earth that he had witnessed on Mars. One day, while out for a walk, Jaxon stumbled upon a strange cave. As he entered, he felt a sudden jolt and his world went black.\n\nWhen he awoke, he found himself back on Mars, surrounded by his people. They had been watching him, waiting for him to return. They told him that his dreams had not been dreams at all. He was the reincarnated child from the ARK, the first human on this planet. They had brought him back to show him what had become of Earth.\n\nJaxon couldn't believe what he was seeing. The air was thick with smog, and the water was brown and murky. The cities were massive, towering structures that stretched as far as the eye could see. But worse than that was the complete disregard for the natural world. Trees were cut down without a second thought, and animals were hunted to extinction.\n\nAs Jaxon explored this new world, he realized that they had not learned anything from the mistakes of their past. The same greed and disregard for nature that had destroyed Mars was present here on Earth.\n\nJaxon knew that he had a duty to do something. He had been given a second chance to save a planet, and he was not going to waste it. He gathered his people and began to teach them the ways of the Earth, the importance of respecting nature and the dangers of pollution.\n\nOver time, Jaxon and his people made a difference. They began to reverse the damage that had been done, and the Earth slowly began to heal. It was a long, hard battle, but Jaxon knew that it was worth it. He had been given a second chance, and he was not going to let it slip away.",
