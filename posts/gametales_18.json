        "text": "About a month ago I purchased Chaosium's 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu Lore Keeper's book (Thanks, [r/callofcthulhu!](https://www.reddit.com/r/callofcthulhu/)! ) after managing to convince my group to let me DM a session or two for Halloween spookiness. \n\nFast forward to game night. I'd read the dang thing practically cover to cover, and decided to run the Crimson Letters module included with it. I made some changes on the fly to it, as needed, mainly because I knew someone in the group had a PDF of the Lore Keeper's book and didn't want to take the chance that they'd read the module. \n\nArkham, and the Miskatonic university. \nThe players: \nRussel Hartenbaum - Handsome professor with a history in pugilism\nBoris Ivanoff - The school butcher\nFlint Ricky - A speakeasy musician who knows a few people in organized crime\nAdolph Yudvich - An eccentric German with an interest in the stars. \n\nEveryone's at the university, late one night, Flint is \"Tutoring\" a young lady in music, Russel stayed late to grade papers, Boris was cleaning and arranging the kitchen, and Adolph was making use of donor privileges and stargazing from the roof. \n\nA young woman screams. The body of Charles Leiter is found. The mystery is kicked off. \n\nA few days later, the dean gathers everyone to his office. As the only four people on campus when the body was discovered, he wants to keep as few people knowing about what happened as possible. They have to find the Arkham With Papers So he makes offers. Tenure for the professor, some dough for Flint and Boris, and more access to university resources for Adolph. Everyone agrees. Some suspects are outlined, and the dean shoos them out of his office before class begins. \n\nThe investigators check out some suspects, gather evidence. They learn about the forgeries of important documents, especially the Arkham Witch Papers, which they are tasked to recover. They learn about his young protege, whom he admitted to the mental hospital. They learn of Emilia Court, working under him, and Anthony Flinders, undergraduate, hounding them for information about the papers. His rival, a whiny man named Harland Roach. They meet Leiter's love interest, a Waitress named Lucy Stone. \n\nShe seems to be the most promising lead, letting the investigators know she'll tell more if they can help her out. She needs money to get out of town, and wants a final farewall from her late love. A monetary forward from the dean and a favor, they're walking into the university after hours, to the biology wing where the body of Leiter is stored temporarily. Flint sees a light in the Dean's office and goes to investigate, separately. Upon letting Lucy see the body, it animates, lurching towards them. \n\nEverybody in the party has their sanity wracked except the professor and boris. The professor drags Lucy back as she screams and shoots at the zombie. Boris helps everyone out and slaps some sense into Adolph. Meanwhile, Flint is sharing a drink with the Dean, who admits to feeling his nerves wracked since this whole incident has begun. Noises begin to happen around them. The dean pulls out a vintage civil war revolver and points it at the noise. They investigate, seeing nothing. But then Flint sees something in the mirror behind the dean. \n\nAdolph tips a cart to slow the zombie, and Boris grabs a hacksaw from the biology wing and deftly butchers its leg off. They retreat. The professor grabs lucy and runs from the campus, taking her to Leiter's house to retrieve some things, and then to the train station. \n\nMeanwhile, Flint yells at the dean to shoot the mirror, as a hand reaches out of it. He yanks the dean out of the way, taking damage himself from the horror. Gunshots ring out and the mirror shatters. Everyone regroups, save for the professor. In his rearview mirror, he sees headlights. \n\nThe first session ends here, everybody mostly intact and sane, and very aware that the supernatural is occurring. When we regroup two weeks later, everything goes clownshoes. \n \nThe professor puts on the gas and heads to the station to be blocked in by a pair of gangsters who had been subtly tailing the investigators since the start. They walk up, one on each side, intent to have talk. The prof ain't havin' none of that shit and floors it. \n\nSensing a threat, one of the gangsters busts the window to try and stop him, only getting glass in the professor's eyes, who runs over a fire hydrant on the way out. A driving shootout is had before Professor Hartenbaum pulls a u-turn, intent to play chicken with a gun. Lucy shoots at the tires, BARELY succeeding with the last shot, and the gangsters are run off the road. One climbs out of the wreck and takes some parting shots. Lucy's struck. \n\nMeanwhile, the Dean orders the remaining investigators to clean up the undead zombie. He'll handle the cover up, but they need to get the body out. So they set out. Adolph and Flint go to the chemistry lab, to get some acid and hopefully deal with the body that way. He takes the school's supply of hydrochloric acid and divvies it into about eight different flasks, giving some to Flint and taking some himself. \n\nBoris goes to deal with the zombie himself, and gets slightly beat up by it, but manages to split the head, and goes to his kitchen for a wheeled trash can. Everyone regroups and puts the zombie in the can, wheeling it out to Adolph's car and throwing it in the trunk. Flint suggests taking it to someone he knows at the speakeasy he works at, and after being extorted for a substantial amount of money, the problem is taken care of. \n\nLucy ends up in the hospital, but alive. The money she grabbed from Charles's house is confiscated by the police. The dean informs everyone the next day that two of their suspects, Court and Flinders haven't come to the university. They investigate the dorms and find Flinders plastered with occult paraphernalia and posters. Emilia's has signs of an abduction. Thanks to a telescope left pointed at a conspicuous building, they have a lead on where to go. \n\nWhen they park their car and get out, they're ambushed by the gangsters, who stick 'em up and have them drop their guns. They're led to the woods and explain that they don't want nothin' to do with this spooky shit, they just want the money Stone was trying to leave with. Flint and Professor are sent to retrieve it from the police while the other people are held hostage. \n\nThey come up with a plan to kill the gangsters and keep the money. First, Flint heads to the police station and makes an ASTOUNDING series of fast talk rolls to get his hands on the money. Then they devise a plan for when they return at night. Flint brings the case (With half it's money removed on the off chance betrayal happens. Flint nearly dies as he tries to deceive one of the gangsters into drinking acid. One of the gangsters heads towards the parking lot, unaware that the professor has crept their car up closer to the gang site. Then, in the words of the player playing Professor Hartenbaum\n\n\"Buckle up Buckaroo. BEEP BEEP MOTHERFUCKER!\" \n\nThe poor gangster never stood a chance as he went under the wheels. This attracts the attention of the other gangster, who is ambushed by his hostages while distracted and put down, BRUTALLY. Head stomping happened to make sure he was dead. The professor keeps the money in a briefcase and hangs onto it. Both gangsters are barely alive, and verge of death. One has a serious headwound, the other, the car one, clearly broken neck. Boris puts the hostage-holder down, Professor the auto-victim. A couple minutes of panicked skull stomping ensues. \n\nThey book it towards the mansion on the hill that they suspect Flinders is at, when they hear the sounds of police. They see a light on in the old house and break in. Kicking the fucking door in because the professor has a 100 in brawl. Adolph looks and says \"Zat looks fun!\" and kicks a fucking closet door in. \n\nThey investigate the lit room to find a hearth burning warmly. Figure out a secret passage is behind it because of course there is. They go down to hear a male voice chanting. They fuck up their stealth so he knows they're coming. They confront Flinders, about to make Emilia Court a sacrifice for the dark forces contained within the Arkham Witch Trials papers. \n\nAdolph manages to hide behind Boris because Boris is huge and Adolph is tiny. Despite Flinders being unstable, and holding the knife literally above Emilia's neck, he takes the shot, and rolls high enough to kill him in one. Luckily, Court is spared. The professor picks up the papers and is promptly seized in the head by the evil knowledge contained within. Sensing blood, the beast within appears, and everyone shits their pants as it slowly approaches. It wants Court, and the professor, and everyone else whose touched the pages. The professor takes the papers, the money, Emilia Court, and FUCKING RUNS, fully intent to leave the others to be eaten or killed or whatever. \n\nThe creature isn't fully solid so attacks pass through it, and leave the attacker suffering the ill effects of touching it. This doesn't stop the panicked professor from kicking it several times in the escape, sprinting out to his car and trying to start it. It doesn't. \n\nThe beast still follows, so the professor sprints down the hill. Meanwhile, once the beast is a certain distance away, things function as normally, so Boris and Adolph climb into Adolph's car and start driving down the hill to try and run over the beast. They lose control of the car when they get close enough, hitting its unsolid form to no effect and crashing into a tree. They just BARELY miss the professor on the way. The car and tree ignite quickly. \n\nThe beast lunges and trips the professor, sending the girl, the papers, and the money tumbling. Adolph seizes the paper, Flint checks on the girl and the money, and Boris keeps Adolph safe. Nobody helps the professor, who is practically dead. \n\nWhen Adolph picks up the papers, the beast locks onto him, and Boris steps in to save Adolph as he runs, losing his life in the process. Adolph dumps the papers onto the burning car and the beast ignites before fading away in a writing, melting puddle. \n\nThe police, already nearby, apprehend everyone and take them in for questioning. The professor against all odds lives, and gentle, kind, good with a bonesaw Boris dies. The whole affair is written off on Flint Ricky stealing chemicals from the school to make some kind of hallucinogen, but the Dean graciously declines pressing charges. Hush-Hush money is paid out to the investigators (Or their next of kin). \n\nThe professor's mind is permanently touched, and with his newly-gained Tenure, he spends his days researching the occult. Flint goes back to playing at the speakeasy, just a little twitchier, always checking over his shoulder. Adolph makes sure his friend Boris receives a lovely buriel, and uses his fortune to make sure this sort of shit doesn't happen again. \n\nMonths later, The professor, healed up, sits with Emilia Court. \"Let's run away\" says the middle aged professor to the college postgraduate. She smiles at him and stands to leave. Telling him he doesn't understand nearly as much as he thinks he does. He responds, with a dark glint in his eye that he knows more than she thinks. \n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5cfh4u/horror_the_long_night_at_exit_23/",
        "text": "So finally got my group together to do a belated Halloween one shot. Decided to run Exit 23, the introductory scenario for Alternity/Dark*Matter, but ran in under a custom ruleset of my own. \n\nThe premise is that the characters are stuck at a rest stop in the Idaho mountains due to a freak blizzard, and there's something out in the snow that's after them...\n\nThe cast are Paul (professional snowboarder), Rick (stereotypical redneck hunter), and Tyrone (an escaped convict). We join them at midnight at the Exit 23 rest stop, where they and a half-dozen other  motorists are stuck for the night, waiting for snowploughs to come dig them out in the morning. There's a few rest stop staff there as well, serving coffee and food. \n\nTwo of the motorists are quite notable; one's a big sullen-looking trucker, and the other is a middle-aged man in a suit, carrying a briefcase. \n\nWe have a bit of time with the cast chatting or getting some sleep, when there's a blast of frigid air that blows open a side door. The lights go out, and then there's an eerie howl and then a scream from the men's bathroom.\n\nTyrone and Rick go to investigate, and find one of their fellow travellers dead in the bathroom; his body is pierced with several long, razor-shard shards of ice. The middle-aged businessman is there as well; he's hurt, but alive. They drag him into the coffee shop, and Paul makes a fumbling attempt to stabilise him, but no luck. Before he dies, the man manages to gasp \"keep it safe.\".\n\nThe side door is still banging in the wind, and the big trucker (Jacob) volunteers to go and close it. Tyrone goes back to the men's room to see if there's anything there; every surface of the room is covered in a layer of frost and it's cold as hell, but he doesn't find anything else. \nSuddenly he hears a noise in the darkness of the small arcade next to the restrooms. Rick has come to join him by this point, and together they rush into the arcade. They startle a kid who's hiding in there; his name's Danny, and he works at the rest stop's McDonalds. He's scared out of his wits, and starts babbling about \"the monster\". Tyrone and Rick dismiss it, and take him back to the coffee shop. They notice though that the door that Jacob went to close is still open, so Rick closes it. There's no sign of Jacob. \n\nAlmost as soon as they're back at the coffee shop, there's a commotion outside; car alarms start wailing and they can hear windows being smashed. Paul freaks out about the safety of his car and his snowboarding gear, and runs out into the snow. Rick follows him. \n\nOutside, Paul can't see anything due to the darkness and the snow, which means he doesn't see the creature coming for him... luckily, he avoids being attacked and hurries back inside. Rick bars the doors as best he can. \"What was it?\" he asks Paul, but he doesn't know. He had a fleeting impression of red eyes, and a large, lean, powerful body. They're both shaken, and return to the coffee shop, where Rick suggests lowering the security shutter and barricading themselves in. Some people get freaked out, but he convinces them it's the safest thing to do. \n\nSomeone suggests moving the businessman's body so that they're not shut in with a corpse. Paul and a young girl who works in the rest stop's convenience store volunteer to take the body back to the restroom. On the way, they encounter Jacob coming out of the restroom. They ask him where the hell's he been, but he shrugs it off and says he was getting something from his rig. Paul asks him if he saw a creature out in the snow, but Jacob says he hasn't. Hmm.\nThey tell him the plan that they're going to barricade themselves in, and he's fine with that, and asks the girl if it's okay for him to go grab a magazine from the convenience store first. She agrees, and off he goes. Paul and the girl drop off the body, and head back. \n\nMeanwhile, Tyrone is getting agitated about suddenly being confined again. He snaps and says he's going to make a break for it.\n\nEveryone says he's crazy, but he's determined. He convinces Danny, the McDonalds kid, to go with him; partly so that he'll have a hostage if the cops catch up with him. Danny's scared of being stuck in the rest stop where two people have died, so agrees. Rick tries to stop them, but no luck. \n\nThey go out into the snow, and Danny has second thoughts. Tyrone yells at him, and shoves him... right into the path of the creature! Danny is torn to pieces, and Tyrone gets a good look at what's stalking them. He runs back into the rest stop, slams (but doesn't lock) the doors, and hides in the arcade.\n\nThe commotion gets Rick and Paul's attention, but then they notice something else; a smell of smoke! They find that a fire's started in the convenience store! Paul starts making an attempt to beat out the fire while Rick runs to get an extinguisher from the lobby... but then the front doors burst open! Rick goes for the extinguisher and shouts for someone to get the doors. Tyrone snaps out of it and, unwilling to let the creature in, gets the doors closed in time. The three of them then tackle the blaze, and manage to put it out before it spreads out of control.\n\nThen they hear a gunshot, and a scream of panic. They run back into the lobby, and see that Jacob has herded everyone out of the coffee shop at gunpoint. He orders Rick and Tyrone to search the restroom for the businessman's briefcase, and if they don't hurry he'll start killing people.\n\nThey check out the restroom again, and find the businessman's briefcase in the bin. Inside is a folder of papers, a loaded revolver, and a small, heavy snowglobe that's cold to the touch (it instantly gives off the vibe of being A Very Bad Thing). They pocket everything (Tyrone takes the gun), and head back to Jacob, who demands the briefcase. Rick throws it at him, and while he's distracted, Tyrone pulls out his gun and shoots Jacob in the arm. He goes down. Tyrone takes his gun, and they tie him up with an extension cable.\n\nThey question him, and he tells them that he was sent by his organisation to retrieve the snowglobe that the businessman apparently stole from them. The creature outside is an ice demon that is helping Jacob and his organisation; it’s responsible for the blizzard that’s trapped everyone, and it won’t leave until the snowglobe is retrieved. Jacob doesn’t really want to kill anyone; he just wants to retrieve the snowglobe. The ice demon is a little more bloodthirsty however…\n\nJacob’s wound is bleeding badly. He says that if they patch him up and give him the snowglobe, he and the demon will leave in peace. He warns that if he dies, the demon will be out of control and will kill them all to find the snowglobe. Not wanting to risk that, Rick decides to stabilise Jacob; he gives Tyrone the snowglobe to hold (and takes Jacob’s gun in return), and gives Paul the notes to skim through.\n\nUpon reading, Paul discovers that the businessman was actually an agent for something called the Hoffman Institute, and the snowglobe was found in the possessions of a deceased and infamous cult leader and diabolist. Unable to determine the properties of the snowglobe, the agent was transporting it to a secure facility, presumably before the blizzard stranded him at Exit 23. Paul correctly assumes that Jacob’s “organisation” are the dead cult leader’s followers; who knows what they want the snowglobe for?\n\nRick tries to smash the snowglobe, but no luck. Then he gets the idea to try heating it up. He puts it over a flame, and outside the howling of the storm and the demon grows louder. The front doors blast open again, and Jacob laughs maniacally. “We tried to do things my way!” he yells, “Now it’s his turn!”. \n\nThe demon stalks into the rest stop, and instantly shreds one of the unfortunate bystanders. Both Paul and Tyrone fail their fear tests seeing this; Paul makes a dash for the coffee shop and starts to pull down the security shutter, and Tyrone uploads his gun into the demon, to no effect.  The other civilians all scatter, screaming, and the demon starts chasing them. With few options left to him, Rick rolls under the coffee shop shutter just before Paul closes it.\n\nSeeing that his gun is no good, Tyrone, out of his mind with fear, offers Jacob the snowglobe, begging him to take it and leave. Jacob takes it and gets to his feet, and says he’ll leave. But before he goes, he gets a sinister look on his face. “You know, I feel like I owe you for shooting me in the arm.”  He snaps his fingers, and the demon turns on Tyrone. He tries to run, but the demon claws at his leg, nearly cutting it off completely. \n\nRick’s seen the whole mess go down, and decides that it’s now or never. He hauls the shutter up and shoots Jacob. The demon, seconds away from killing Tyrone, screams in rage. It retrieves the snowglobe from Jacob’s body, and dissolves into a storm of swirling ice and wind, and flies out of the rest stop. It’s over.\n\nIn the morning, when the snowploughs have cleared the snow, an ambulance arrives for Tyrone and a black car pulls up. A smartly-dressed woman approached Rick and Paul, and asks them what happened. They explain that the male agent is dead, and that the demon took the snowglobe. She gets a sombre look on her face, gets back in her car and drives off, leaving Rick and Paul to wonder what the consequences of the long night at Exit 23 will be…   ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5c9fr4/7th_sea_a_seventh_sea_horror_one_shot_the_stone/",
        "text": "Preface - I GM'd this game a few weeks ago for my players during October. They wanted to try 7th Sea, I wanted to do a Horror game. I hopped on /r/rpg for some advice as I have never run 7th Sea before, and /u/writermonk [gave me an incredibly cool idea for a story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/565epq/obligatory_gm_help_thread_writing_horror/d8ghcm9/) which I sort of ran with.\n\n**GM Note: I know little to nothing beyond a cursory understanding of 7th Sea's setting. If nations / locations seem to be weird, just roll with it. Also, First post here and god damn its long. Sorry. TLDR at the bottom.**\n\n----\n\nPlayers were:\n\n* Captain Zacharie from Montaigne (Exploration / Sword User)\n* Heloise from Montaigne (Social / Sword user)\n* Klaus from Eisen (Monster hunter carrying a huge harpoon)\n* Niamh from Innis (Bard with Glamour power)\n* and\n* Jona from Vesten (One armed berserk)\n\n----\n\n**GM Note: The ship (a brig with tons of cannon) and its crew were given a mission to collect a Montaigne Admiral from a remote island where he had been living for years. One of the players was going to be late, so I had to come up with a reasonable way to include them, but leave them out for awhile. I was really wanting to try and push a horror style story, so this actually played in quite well.**\n\nThe game began with the players just off the coast of the island when a massive storm hit. They worked together to keep the ship afloat, with a few poor rolls resulting in Heloise (the player that was late) being knocked unconscious as one of the masts snapped in half sending a huge weight into her head. One of the crew was also tossed overboard and Klaus lept in to save him. As he was hauled back onto the ship, he caught a glimpse of a strange shadowy figure in the water moments before he was tugged out.\n\nMaking landfall, the crew entered a gothic style town. The storm was coming down heavy on them and they sought assistance from the towns folk. Being a traditional gothic horror style town, they were promptly made to feel unwelcome and went on to meet the Admiral at his mansion overlooking the harbor. A small party of 5 or so crewmen were dispatched to cut down trees to repair the mast during this period.\n\nUpon arrival at the mansion, they were greeted warmly by the house staff, including the gaunt looking butler who I believe I named Louis. Once inside I had started to get a better handle on the system, and began toying with the setting.\n\nEach player was led to a private room that was customized to meet the expectations of the character. \n\nThe posh captain was given a room with massive comfortable pillows and a huge library on one wall. The bard was taken down a long hallway filled with weapons and scenes of battle. The barbarian was given a sparse room with a balcony overlooking the garden maze, etc. All the while I described the house as a well lit, but run down place. Suits of armor line some of the halls, weapons adorn the walls, large chairs, clocks, etc. Basically think Beauty and the Beasts mansion. Everything seems to have small pools of standing water though, around half an inch or so. Heloise, the still missing player is taken to a room and told she will be given excellent medical care from the house physician.\n\nHere we start throwing in some of the weird. One of the players hears a giggling laughter coming form their room. On investigation they find what seems to be one of the servants hiding under their bed laughing. As they shout and move to engage, the butler of the house begs them to stop, saying he's an older member of the Admirals old crew who has seen better days. They stop and the man is led away.\n\nOther players see mysterious servants out in the rain, or hear weird voices behind them, etc. The two characters that aren't sailors feel sort of sick in the house, from how it sways in the storms wind. \n\nEventually they are brought to the common room in the mansion where they were told the admiral would meet them. They are informed he does not respond well to the rain and will come down in the morning. They are shown relics of his past adventures. A set of African styled masks. A set of bone handled pistols. Maps and charts. Then they see a large stone in the rough shape of a human heart. I run through all this very quickly so they don't focus on any one item. The players ask questions and investigate the relics before being called to dinner. As they turn to leave, one of them hears a voice begging for help over their shoulder. They whip around to see nothing, and assume that one of the items / house is haunted.\n\n---- End of Pt 1. ----\n\nDinner is interesting. Stepping through the inch and a half of standing water, they arrive at a massive banquet hall where feasts would be held. The food brought out to them is barely edible. Thin soup with almost nothing in it, barely cooked meat, sour wine, all brought out by red faced extremely overweight cooks, a sharp contrast to the gaunt butler. The captain protests the quality of the meal and nearly starts a fight with the cook. When the situation is diffused, Louis assures him they will be disciplined properly and requests they turn in for the night.\n\nAt this point the party completely splits up to their rooms. They all agree something strange is going on and need to figure out what it is. Moving down the soaked hallways, the Barbarian finds her weapon missing from her room and hears the giggling of the mad sailor coming from somewhere in the house. She moves to find the man, stomping through the house. The bard decides to go investigating the rooms of the house, finding a locked room with an awful smell coming from it. Upon picking the lock she finds herself in a strange alchemy lab with numbered vials of chemicals. The monster hunter determined to find the source of the voices begins going up and down the halls searching for the source of them, noting the continually rising water in the hallways and attributing it to the storm. The captain goes to sleep after consulting the library in the room searching for information on the Admiral. He finds a list of names and numbers.\n\nAt this point, all the players are separated, and investigating things at once. I decide around now is the time to start bringing things together. We start with the captain. He finds himself in a nightmare. A dark, cold place where he cannot see anything around him. He feels like he isn't alone, but the cold is rising and he cannot get away. He pulls off some excellent rolls and begins seeing weird visions in the dream. Men stacked on top of each other, each with a hole in their chest. Water rising, etc. He finally runs out of raises and the last thing he feels is the water closing in around his face as he sinks down...only to wake up in a room completely full of water. He shouts for help before the water closes around him which is heard by the monster hunter. He rushes to the captains room finding water pouring out from under the door. Using his weapons he frees his captain, resulting in a massive out pouring of water into the hallway. With great difficulty they seal the room back up, but water is still slowly filling the hall. They move to find Heloise as the player was going to return soon and they are concerned for her. They move to her room where they find her still in bed, head and arms wrapped in bandages. After a moment they realize that she shouldn't...have...arm bandages. They remove them to find large gouges of flesh have been removed from her arms surgically. \n\nAt the same time, the Bard begins to investigate the basement connected to the Alchemy lab. As she moves down she discovers stacks of corpses on top of each other, each with a hole in their chest as well as a brig in which the 5 members of their crew sent out to locate timber have been held. She works to free them as they explain they were attacked by the servants of the house while they were working and brought here. \n\nWhile she is freeing them, the barbarian locates the sound of the giggling and recovers her sword from the mad crewman. He flees into a room where she pursues. She finds herself in the Kitchen, where contrary to the dinner earlier, there seems to be heavily bubbling pots of food! She goes to try one, and in classic horror style, finds the corpse of the Cook that caused a disturbance earlier has been butchered and thrown into a stew.\n\n---- End of Pt 2. ----\n\n**So the Crew have now figured out part of our tale. They meet up in the front of the home and consult the information each has collected. The captains dreams link with the corpses found in the basement, and the numbered jars link with the list of names found earlier. They decide to split up again, half going to find the Stone Heart in the common room, while the Bard and the crew arm themselves to fight off the now Cannibal servants.**\n\nWhile they collect weapons from the walls, the Bard and her party of sailors find themselves at the foot of the stairwell leading to the second floor of the building where a large waterfall has now developed. Standing atop this is the servants of the house, holding various assorted weapons. Cleavers, fishing spears, etc. Battle is joined as the first floor begins to flood. The bard is quite a competent fighter, and seems to be doing quite well, however the House seems to have it out for her. Seaweed sprouts from the floor, grabbing at her and her crews feet. Sharp barnacles begin popping out and lining the walls. The swaying feeling from earlier comes to a head as an almost full on sea sickness. The house has taken on the feel of a sinking ship, and all the players have finally realized this.\n\n**At this point, a bit of GM trickery was necessary. We had a few hours left of gameplay, and they wanted to keep going. I admit that I had to tweak the original story idea since they progressed so fast. They also wanted to stab some things.**\n\n When they arrive in the common room, they find the heart is gone. With a brief bright idea, I have the room fill with the sound of drums as the masks on the walls attack the Captain, Berserk and Monster Hunter. I described them as shadowy animalistic monsters that slash and move through the room, leaping out and slicing at them then vanishing.  The battle is pretty intense, with players quickly getting the hang of the combat system, throwing spears, hurling monsters out windows, etc. \n\nBack with our Bard, things are not looking so well. She's taken some pretty heavy hits and one of her own crew is dead. However, as things begin to look bleak, the rest of the party shows up from their battle with the shadow creatures. At this point, the water has reached their waist, the whole house looks internally like a sinking cargo hold and finally our missing player shows up, leaping out of a convenient grandfather clock the players decided to store her in. To really drive home the haunted ship/ghost bit, around this time one of the player sees a fin swimming down the hallway towards them....\n\n---- End of Pt 3. ----\n\nPanic ensues as they all scramble to move to the second floor, fighting their way up as a pair of sharks attempt to drag them down. The butler, Louis, flees down the hall, leaving a trail of blood they follow upward to locked door and stairwell leading upward. At the top of the tower they find a large glass windowed room with the corpse of the Admiral left in it. He's been dead for quite some time and Louis stands over him with the Stone Heart in hand. A blue glow moves from the Heart to the Admirals body, animating him in a weird, stop motion-y style of movement. \n\n**GM Note: I admit to failure as a GM here, I had trouble working the two ends of the story together. I knew the players wanted a large battle at the end with whatever supernatural force was controlling the house. I think in practice it worked better than in writing, as they seemed to understand that the Heart was the source of the creepy haunting. Also the Admiral was shamelessly based off Kunkaa from DOTA 2**\n\nOne last time the players move to battle the forces of the house, now animating the Admirals corpse. The Admiral is described with this [image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hmi0YywXbmg/maxresdefault.jpg). Wielding a watery sword, the players are split between combating him, and attempting to acquire the heart. To really ramp up the final battle, the Admiral slams his sword into the ground and a massive blast of blue light consumes the room. When it clears, massive kraken tentacles begin to slam at the glass windows of the tower, almost as though they are trying to drag the tower (crows nest) down into the deep. The players divide themselves up, some holding off the Admiral, some combating tentacles, and some attempting to acquire the heart. It's a long, tough battle with a few near misses as players are grabbed and slammed against things, but finally the Bard manages to snatch the heart away. She hurls it into the air where one of the players draws a pistol and puts a round through it, shattering it into pieces. \n\nInstantly the spell seems to break. The admiral falls to the ground, the tentacles retreat, and the house begins to return to normal. The damage to the Tower though leads the players to leap out and over the cliff side the Mansion was built on to where their ship has conveniently sailed to meet them, having seen the battle from afar. As they climb aboard, our Captain gives the order to \"Send that house to hell.\", and all canons open up, blasting it to splinters. The final scene of our session was the Bard player quietly looking into their backpack at the pieces of the softly glowing stone shards...\n\n----\n\nDamn. That went way way longer than I thought it would. The entire session fit into about 6 hours of gameplay. The players really enjoyed the one shot nature of the game, and 7th Sea was an interesting system for sure. I admit to a small bit of railroading to get the plot going, and a few GM failures on my part that required a deus ex machina to keep things on track, but noone seemed to notice in actual gameplay. Really thanks to /u/writermonk for giving me the basic script. It worked out wonderfully. Exceptionally creepy.\n\nTL:DR - Players go to a creepy house and find cannibal servants while the house slowly turns into a ghost ship and sinks, leading them to an epic battle with a reanimated admiral and a kraken.",

        "text": "Hey r/gametales! This is part three of four write-ups that I’ve been catching up on! This week was our spooky Halloween session, so nothing spoiler related for any campaigns, but it was certainly a nice break from the breaking of Phlan.\n\nAs always, our characters include:\n\n&gt;Dietrich, Tiefling Warlock (DW)\n\n&gt;Keth, Half-orc Paladin (KP)\n\n&gt;Drache, Human Cleric (DC)\n\n&gt;Grantha, Human Monk (GM)\n\n&gt;Vira, Halfling Druid (VD)\n\n~~\n\nOur quest starts off a week or so after the great train robbery, and on a high note, with both DW and DC joining the mile high club with their respective partners Aya and Leila. We learn a lot about each other as players, and the tone of the game is set…we think.\n\nA few days pass and the NPCs decide to throw a celebration now that everyone is accounted for and we actually have food/a small farm. Whilst everyone is upstairs celebrating, Aya is working in her lab downstairs. Despite getting a high charisma roll, DW fails to convince Aya to come up and join in the fun as she’s nose-deep in her work. Holding his hands up, he tells her that Elisande (their “daughter”) will come and help her since she wants to spend time with her.\n\nHalf an hour or so later a huge *boom* erupts from the basement, causing the prison to shake. The group, followed by a few NPCs of note rush downstairs. The entire lab has been rocked; the table overturned, papers everywhere, equipment smashed. A trail of blood leads the group to a door sized hole in the wall, surrounded by puss and tentacle-looking appendages. Through the hole was a mirror image of the room, in the same state as this one.\n\nAya and Elisande were missing.\n\nTying ropes around themselves for safety, the group ventures through the portal into an uncomfortable eerie world where everything feels dull. The mood is heavy, somber, and everything looks washed out. VD, in tiger form, nearly wretches from the smell in the air as she enters the portal. Moving out of the basement the group makes their way upstairs where the air feels thick. DW uses a small flame spell to create light, which makes DC sick. No one works out that there is wild magic in effect because communication is overrated.\n\nFootsteps from downstairs make the players wary as they’d been the only ones in the room. They turn around and heart attacks are had by everyone as two inconsequential NPCs had followed us through. They’re told to wait in the basement in case anything happens. They begrudgingly leave. We joke that they’re the red shirts in the adventure.\n\nThe floorboards creak under the group’s feet as they venture out further through the main area of the ground floor, when the floor collapses underneath them, sending Drache falling into the basement. He sees one of the NPCs jabbering to themselves, and hears a nasty, slurping, crunching noise coming from the dark to his right. Emerging from the dark is…[this…thing]( http://img02.deviantart.net/c1db/i/2016/207/4/5/demogorgon_by_blazenmonk-dabgu2v.jpg). At first Drache doesn’t know what to expect. It stalks over to the jabbering NPC and decides [he looks tasty as hell]( https://cdna2.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/003/387/898/large/limkuk-art-demogorgon-alta.jpg?1473169485) and proceeds to eat him. \n\nDC takes over being the jabbering maniac, shouting at the group in-comprehensively. Not knowing what the hell is going on, we lower a rope and pull DC up. Seeing the jabbering wreck of a cleric, we decide the best thing to do is, of course, go down into the basement! We look down and see Mr. Teeth looking up at us. DW faints and is out for the count. VD retreats into her mind palace. KP is unaffected. GW is blind and has no fucks to give. DC continues being a jabbering maniac. \n\nWith the two casters down, the melee characters jump down and begin to beat the thing into submission before VD snaps back to reality and joins in with the mauling, causing it to flee further up into the alternative dimension’s prison. DW is brought back to reality once the group leaves the basement. All back on track, the group decide that now there is danger, they need to knuckle down on their search.\n\nCalling out for both Elisande and Aya, they hear crying coming from outside. VD slinks out into the courtyard, finding Elisande crouched behind some barrels. Giving her a lift, both come back inside where there’s a tearful reunion between DW and Elisande. They get Elisande back through the portal, and the group decides that Aya must be up, and they head towards the first floor. They check each prison cell going clockwise from the stairwell. They pass a room with amniotic sacs hanging from the ceiling, with the same creatures in as the group fought not ten minutes before. We proceed to sneak along so as to not disturb them when we find a locked door.\n\nDW hisses Aya’s name, and bolts begin to unlock, the terrified elf bursting out and hugging him, blathering about how she was sorry/terrified. Before anyone can say anything one of the sacs breaks open and a baby Mr. Teeth emerges. The group, having what they came for, run back down the stairs unceremoniously, VD casting lightning on the ceiling to drop rubble on the monster to slow it down. Despite going invisible, everyone jumps down and through the portal, sealing it up from the safe side. \n\nAya calms down and explains she was researching “The Weave”, the world in which magic comes from; she explains when casters use magic, they draw energy from the weave, manipulate it, and then release it. After being kidnapped, Aya was trying to help the group become stronger by tapping directly into The Weave to increase our magic output. Despite the danger, the group forgives her. Deciding that they’ve had enough shenanigans to last them a while, Aya finally decides to get some food; no charisma checks needed.\n\n~~\n\nLater that evening Aya and DW are on the roof when they’re approached by the Thieve’s Guild leader (one of the faction leader NPCs staying with us in the prison). He asks Aya if she would be willing to open that portal again as it could be used as a powerful weapon in the future. DW steps in and says no; if worse comes to worse, he’ll open the portal. The three agree to keep it a secret, and the man leaves, leaving DW and Aya to begin planning how to open the portal and utilise it to their own strengths.",

        "text": "Hey r/gametales! This is the second of four write-ups that I’ll be bashing out in a short amount of time. Again, sorry that I’ve been lagging behind with these tales, so I hope the posts makeup for it!  As always, spoilers for the “Hoard of the Dragon Queen; Tyranny of Dragons” campaigns; You’ve been warned.\n\nOur players in this adventure are:\n\n&gt;**Dietrich, DW**; Tiefling Warlock, summoner of tentacles on a way-too-frequent basis. \n\n&gt;**Keth, KP**; Half-Orc paladin or Tyr, party tank and all-around good guy.\n\n&gt;**Drache, DC**; Human Cleric, self-proposed “emo” of the party and roller of many single digits.\n\n&gt;**Grantha, GM**; human monk. Old, blind and all around amazing. Self described as “Fu Manchu”.\n\nThis week we meet our new character and permanent ally:\n\n&gt;**Vira, VD**; Halfling Druid. Shy, innocent, and Dietrich’s new mount/future best friend\n\n~~~\n\nWe begin our story about one month after the last adventure. The Resistance has set up base camp in the abandoned prison a few miles down from Phlan, and every day is spent training up civilians, hunting/searching for food, and making battle plans. \n\nThe day started normal like any other, until an eagle swooped down into the prison courtyard, catching the attention of DW’s “Daughter” Elisande. After getting a good look around, the eagle takes off, only to come back mere minutes later as a Halfling leading an old bedraggled man. The two are bought into the courtyard, where the old man asks for DW. Stepping forth, he introduces himself as the Lord Sage of Phlan, causing a stir amongst everybody.\n\nAn old friend had returned and a new friend had joined us, all the better for the plan to take back the city.\n\nAfter letting the two settle in, they’re bought into the war room where everyone is pondering over a map of Phlan. DW’s other half Aya is still missing, and the food supplies are running low. A prisoner, a cult member, sat on the top floor in a cell ready to be interrogated again as so far there had been little success.\n\nAfter employing the help of our new friends, VD and GM managed to find out that a huge shipment of goods were being sent on their way to Phlan. Food. Weapons. Armor. Livestock. Everything we’d need to put ourselves up for a long while yet. He also discloses that a special guest is being carted along for the ride. The prisoner is thanked kindly before being killed quickly.\n\nVD finally realizes just what the fuck she signed up for. Willingly. Sort of.\n\n~~\n\nThe next few days are spent creating barricades along the path where the shipment will be passing through, with everyone chipping in. KP’s protégé, a young man named Gawain, spends his time attempting to hit on VD with no luck as she’s too naïve to realize what’s happening. With the trap set, we wait at the time we’re told for the shipment to come through.\n\nAnd my god it was glorious.\n\nThe shipment was a magical freight train; four huge wooden carriages long, controlled by magic so they levitated along guarded by 8 riders (four along each side, two per carriage). And it’s moving fast. They smash through our first barrier and that’s the signal to begin.\n\nDietrich, riding on the back of a tiger-formed VD, hitches a ride onto the top of the first carriage, where the two proceed to try and break into the wooden container. GM joins us on the front after leaping gracefully onto the moving behemoth. KP and DC jump onto the last carriage and break into the door on the back, proceeding to destroy the guards inside in a bloody bath (and scaring the livestock into producing manure for our future farm; two birds, one stone.)\n\nOn the front carriage, a tall, burly man climbs onto the top to face off against the three there. DW takes the opportunity to dive inside the door where the man emerged from, leaving VD and GM to take him on.\n\nOr at least they were going to, until they saw a bridge coming at them really quickly, and let that do the work for them. VD was once again left traumatized as she was showered in blood. \n\nInside the carriage, DW finds the sorcerer keeping the thing going, four guards surrounding him, and his other-half Aya chained up bloody and beaten in the corner. DW does as DW does and summons his favourite tentacle friend from a different dimension which then proceeds to make friends with the spell-caster and his buddies; he finished off the five enemies by summoning daggers to re-enact fruit ninja with them. \n\nThe carriages slowed to a halt as they were raided for supplies, the dead bodies of cultists found throughout (they’d died via suicide cyanide pills). Pulling Aya out of the carriages, VD took her to safety as everyone else raided the carriages. The day ended with everyone returning home, Aya now safe, and everyone full of hope and spirit as something had finally gone right for the crew. \n\nFor now.",

        "text": "Hey r/gametales! Sorry there’s been such a long hiatus between write-ups. Things have been crazy for me IRL, and as such, I have several write ups to do. I’ll be trying a slightly different writing style to keep them relatively short, as they’re honestly stories that I could write novels about with intricate details.\n\n As always, spoilers for the “Hoard of the Dragon Queen; Tyranny of Dragons” campaigns; NSFW for language used and possible descriptions. You’ve been warned.\n\nOur players in this adventure are:\n\n&gt;**Dietrich**, Tiefling Warlock, summoner of tentacles on a way-too-frequent basis. Henceforth known as **DW**\n\n&gt;**Keth**, Half-Orc paladin or Tyr, party tank and all-around good guy. Henceforth known as **KP**\n\n&gt;**Drache**, Human Cleric, self-proposed “emo” of the party and roller of many single digits. Henceforth known as **DC**\n\n&gt;**Aramir Beregond**, human ranger and Hero of the Moon Sea. Actual certified bad-ass. Henceforth known as **AR**\n\nThis week we meet our new character and friend:\n\n&gt;**Grantha**, human monk. Old, blind and all around amazing. Self described as “Fu Manchu”. Henceforth known as **GM**\n\n~~~\n\n\nAt the end of our last little adventure we saved some civilians and shipped them off with a guild within the city, saying farewell to our old Ranger who was determined to bring our old Rogue back to well-needed justice. This week, the plan was to escape the city and head towards an abandoned prison 2-3 miles outside of the town’s borders as our new base of operations. The Lord Reagent of Phlan decides to come with us, as he was once a soldier and needs to get out of the city to begin travel to the next city along.\n\n\nOur first task was to get out of the city. Through some well-passed intelligence tests DW works out tat there’s a Basilisk in the sewers, as we’d seen “lifelike stone carvings” down there on our assault on the castle last time. He says that our best bet is to avoid the sewers because he doesn’t know if we can take on a basilisk right now.\n\n\nSo it’s decided that we’re going to escape the city via the sewers (yep) because why not? On our way to the sewer opening we crossed paths with a patrol of cultists goading an old man with a walking stick. The old man then proceeded to beat the ever loving shit out of them, much to the amusement of AR. Turns out that the old man was his former master, and thus Grantha the Monk joined the crew.\n\n\nFinding our way to the sewer entrance we all decide it’s best no one get petrified so tie rags over our eyes to keep us safe, and with GM leading the way with his blindsense, we make our way through the sewage system. Soon enough we hear water moving and the sound of a huge creature coming towards us. Using detect magic, DW can see something “riding” atop what sounds like a large creature/\n\n\n In a controlled panic DC does the smartest thing and simply shoots a guiding bolt at the water, frying the basilisk almost outright. It rears up out of the water screeching, crushing something as its head smashes against the ceiling. Going purely on sound alone, AR aims an arrow, strikes, and kills the Basilisk. We take off our masks to discover a large Kobolds body now smooshed and dripping from the ceiling.\n\nCool.\n\nFinally we reach the exit to the sewage system, which ends in a 10ft drop down into the river beneath us. That’s when we hear the sound of wings above and a voice calling out hat we won’t escape alive.\n\nLooking up, we see a Wyvern, carrying a construct, being ridden by some sort of elf magic caster, who proceeds to try and freeze us all. Luckily everyone passes their dexterity save, and the battle is on. \n\nDW casts Hunger of Hadar on the caster, summoning a portal basically on top of the dragon, causing it to get pissed off. It drops the construct which the Tanks decide to go for. The fight is surprisingly short; the construct is easily dealt with by being bashed into hell, and the sorceress was thrown off of her Wyvern as it flew off in fear. She died upon impact to the floor alongside the damage sustained from magic/arrows.\n\nIt’s a small victory and a big fuck you to the cult that had overtaken our city. As we wander into the forest by the lake we’d come out in, we see a small gathering of people; NPCs we’d come to know and love. They had refused to abandon us in our time of need, and snuck their own way through the city to be with us, alongside the local thieve’s guild and their leader. \n\nWith a renewed hope and sense of purpose, the now 130 strong group walked the two miles into the night to the abandoned prison. Our new home and base of operations of the Resistance.\n\n~~\n\nMiles away a Dire Wolf emerges from a small copse of trees, sniffing at an old, bedraggled man. Slowly it shimmered as it turns into a small, blonde Halfling female, who proceeds to heal and help the man. Heading off towards Phlan, she asks him his business in the city and he chuckles.\n\n“My city has been taken over by an evil cult and an even more vile dragon. And Phlan needs it’s true Lord Regent now more than ever.”\n",

        "text": "So, to preface: I was GMing for 4 unruly people. 1 boyfriend and girlfriend, the boyfriend being a loud and obnoxious and wont stop trying to 'give' advice for other characters, the girlfriend being skilled and willing to RP but often fought with other players. 1 other guy who was obnoxious and often immature, and 1 other girl who was very willing to RP but was very unspoken. \n\nIt was midnight, it was dark, and they wanted to play a game. I printed out a map of an old school, brought out some uno cards, and turned out all the lights. The game began with the first person to make a legal play waking up surrounded in darkness. Slowly everyone else caught on that they had to play cards to complete actions. Soon the party was awake and playing... Themselves. When the girlfriend asked me who they were, I just said \"Its you. You wake up there.\" Slowly again they each began to realize they had no powers, no gear, it was just them in a dark room.\n\nIt was immature's turn, and he played a Draw 4 on Quiet. What happened next was Quiet stood from her desk, tripped, and nearly split her head in falling. I look to everyone else and say \"She's bleeding out. What do you do?\" It was dark and everyone started to panic, and Immature said \"I wrap my overshirt around her head\". I responded \"Ok, do that.\" Now Quiet had a shirt wrapped around her head and she was stabilizing. Everyone was having fun, and started to think more about WHAT to do rather than trying to jump in on each others moments. \n\nAs the night went on, I continued to be vague about where they were, slowly they uncovered that they were in a schoolhouse, that some sort of experiments were going on, and that they were not alone. It was inside the arts and crafts room that I was getting quieter and quieter. Everyone was leaning in to hear me speak. As they searched the room...\n\nSuddenly the haunting sounds of little children laughing came from my phone. Immature screamed, Quiet screamed, and girlfriend actually backed away in terror. Everyone had either been on their phones or talking to each other with what to do, that playing a sound caught them off guard. \n\nFrom there things got creepier. I had blood trails on the floor, shadows disappearing around a corner, a never-ending stairway that Quiet was SURE would lead to safety... And all of this they did to each other. Any time they had to draw a card, or got skipped, bad things happened. And it took one of them nearly dying for them to realize that if they wanted to keep everyone alive, they would have to draw cards themselves on purpose. \n\nBy the end of the night... Everyone was a mess. I had taken Immature into an alternate realm where everyone around him was disappearing. Quiet was seeing the face of a child in a book begging to be helped, girlfriend was seeing a dark version of herself, and boyfriend was running from Jason Voorhees. And in real life, Quiet was crying saying she kept envisioning her own kid, Immature was twitchy and freaked out due to anxiety, girlfriend was creeped out because of the thought of fighting her own mind was bad, and the boyfriend was... Well he was just quiet now. \n\nThe game ended with the sun rising, everyone making a final play and nobody dying. \n\nAnd that was the first time I ever ran a Horror themed game. I broke 3 out of my 4 players. So... should I be proud? Or is this really just a horror story?\n\n[EDIT] Wow, the front page? You guys are awesome!\n\n[EDIT2] [I hope you all enjoy the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletop/comments/5cggus/cbrpg_uno_edition_gamerulesstory_insideeasy_setup/)!",

I immediately recognized the glory that would come from such an endeavor, all the adventure and riches we would encounter. Of course my sister, so concerned with my health, pled with me to reconsider. She fret over the danger and bad guys we would come across, but I told her to pish her posh and I was going and it was settled. The she gave me that grin she get’s sometimes. \n\nLater I went to the caravan with my horse, Ashenhide, who is the best horse. We met a guy with an eye patch. He’s really grumpy, but we’re friends anyway. He bosses me around a lot but it’s okay because he tells me about cool stuff to do. We also met a dwarf who’s really smart and is also my friend. \n\nThen we made three more friends. One was a guy who fights monsters. He fights a lot so he’s pretty cool, but not as cool as me. Another was a cat man who fights but also is magic. He’s pretty cool too also, but still not as cool as me. Then there was this guy who was magic and funny but he died and that’s sad. \n\nThen we went to a dwarf’s house, but it was full of goblins for some reason. Some of the goblins were mean so we killed them in an epic battle that was so cool you guys. Then the ones that were nice became our friends. Then there was a creepy guy in a spooky helmet who turned out to be a bad guy who I hate, but we didn’t know that yet. Actually maybe we met him later, I forget. Then we found some rectangles that had words in them, but only sometimes, and a big orb thing that was hard to look at. Some of our goblin friends looked at it and died and that was sad.\n\nLater the caravan got attacked by kobolds. I remember thinking they were cool and really good fighters. I wanted some of them to be friends, but they didn’t want to, so we killed them. Then we took all the stuff they had and tried to sell it to a guy. The guy didn’t want to be nice and wouldn’t buy our stuff, But I am the greatest businessman and negotiated a deal and also called the cops. The cops that came had fancy suns on them. The cops made the mean man pay us which made me happy. Then the cops left with the mean man, so they could be friends with him and teach him not to be so mean. \n\nUh, then I think we fought some skeletons in a place and I got a cool new sword. I didn’t get to ride my horse Ashenhide, who is the best horse, so I was sad. Also a new friend was there. She healed us when we got hurt, except that I never got hurt, because I am the best fighter. She is our friend and she loves us, and also I think she’s the cat guy’s mom. Also I broke a statue, I mean I found some gems that were near a statue and would have looked really cool if they were it’s eyes, but they weren’t so I took them.\n \nAnother time we went to this dwarf place that It had a fountain with stars on it that was neat, and I pushed it, and we found a secret room that had all this cool science stuff and a big big biiiiig metal arrow that I thought was cool. I got some space bombs and some fancy armor I don’t know how to turn on and I’m pretty sure is magic. I mean, I totally know how to turn it on kuz I’m the smartest, but I don’t think it would be fair that I’m so strong and also I’m magic. Also we got some cool guns that Nobody used. A weird accountant guy wanted our sweet loot, but we gave it to the smart dwarf instead. \n\nThen we went to another place and we met some dwarfs and one of them became my best friend. We rode my horse, Ashenhide, who is the best horse, together. The magic guy made some grease here and people fell down and I laughed. Then there was a guy who could teleport, and I don’t like him because he killed my friend, but not now, later. It was fun to fight him, because he thought teleporting was a good thing to do, but I totally kicked his but. That day I got to ride my horse,  Ashenhide, who is the best horse, with my new best friend and we even got to fight a guy too. It was a good day, but now it makes me sad kuz the magic guy is dead.\n\nEventually we met a lady with a bear. She got really mad when I tried to fight the bear, even though how was I supposed to know the bear was her best friend. Also sometimes she is also a bear, which can be really confusing. She is my friend but it is a secret, even to her. \n\nThe we went to a town that was all zombies, which is a weird way for a town to be, so we took the zombies away. Then we went down a hole to a crypt and do you know what? The guy was there! The bad guy in the spooky armor! He was doing a magic, but we were all like, “you’re bad, stop doing your magic!” then I hit him with my sword. But he just gooped around my sword and he ignored me, which made me mad, because I’m the best and you can’t ignore me. So I picked him up and I through him! It was soooooo cool you guys, you don’t even know! Then the cat guy and the fighty guy hit him a bunch too before he even hit the ground, which was also cool, but not as cool as me. Then the bad guy was like “Oh noez! Boeford is the strongest and I am a scardy baby!” So he ran away. Also the magic guy tried to run away but the healy woman held his hand. \n\nThen we came to a big ol’ town and we got a cool apartment together. I’d rather have my own house, but it’s okay because all of my friends are there. We went a library once because of I forget, but it’s important later so remember that it happened. Then we got to go in the sewers and do you know who we found? The kobolds from earlier! They still didn’t want to be friends, so we killed them, and also because it was our job. Then the bear lady got mad at me because I took a coin that I found fair and square and totally didn’t belong to anybody anyway. Then the healy lady took the coin and secretly gave it back to me, which made me so happy!!!! I still have that coin because it reminds me of my friend and how she made me happy that day.\n\nBut guys! I figured out how to get kobold friends, and the answer is to get kobold baby friends!!! So I adopted all the Kobold eggs and going to to raise them to be knights and run my business and I love them. I can’t wait for them to meet their aunties, so we can be one big happy family. My sisters are going to love them so much!\n\nThen the fighty guy started fighting other fighty guys. He’s gotten pretty good, but he’s still not as good as me. I think he’s famous or something. So now I have a famous friend. And the bear lady made a whole bunch of new friends, which is cool, because they get to be my friends too! Meanwhile, I’ve been spending a lot of time with my baby friends. I went back to the library and got books on how to be a good daddy to kobolds, and how to make sure they became knights.(see i told you the library was important!) I even got them a cart to live in and a nanny to nanny them. She is also my friend. \n\n\nThen the guy who can teleport came back and stabbed my magic friend. He died and I was sad. But then he was a ghost and I was happy that he could be my ghost friend. Then a pirate showed up! He told us were to meet more pirates, so we could all be friends. Then the smart dwarf told us to use those guns we got a million years ago, which was weird, because why would we need guns to go meet new pirate friends. Anyway, I brought the biggest gun to meet the new pirate friends. I thought they might have cool stories, so I asked them about it, but it turns out they didn’t want to be friends, so I hit them with my gun. But then my freinds got mad at me and told me to use the gun as a gun and it shot lasers! And then I killed the pirates with laser, and it was cool. But guess what, they had a big ol’ laser too! So I had to run as they shot the laser at me, and explosions happened behind me all cool like. But a big tough guy got in front of me, so I shot him with my laser and he died! Then I jumped on the the pirate ship with the big laser and blew it up, PACHOO!!! It was neat.\n\nBut while I was doing that, the friend pirate was throwing grenades onto the ships, which was cool, and the cat guy was freeing slaves from the slave boats, which was also cool. But neither was as cool as me. Then the magic guy’s ghost kind of stopped being a thing, I guess, which was sad. \n\nLater the smart dwarf had a friend who i’m not sure if I want to be my friend or not. Actually, the smart dwarf has been doing things that make me not so sure if he is a good friend or not too. But the smart dwarf said we should get a part for him. When we went to get the part we found some robots. I was riding my horse, Ashenhide, who is the best horse, so I got to hit them with my lance, which was cool. Then we found Potato, the queen of a place, who is a cool old guy. He’s my friend. He had a hat that was the part the smart dwarf wanted. \n\nThen the smart dwarf wanted another part, so I got a cool shovel from the store, and dug up the part from under the ground, while the others did dumb boring stuff without me. Also the pirate had a dildo for some reason? \n\nThen guess what happened!!! THE BABIES HATCHED!!!! Now there are so many baby friends all over and I love them all! \n\nOkay now I have to go on another adventure. Bye bye! ",

        "text": "I've been planning this for a week or two now: a big, epic battle with a dragon. This wasn't going to be your garden-variety \"stand still and swing swords\" battle--I wanted an *epic* fight, like the one with Smaug in the second Hobbit movie. So, here's what happened:\n\nThe players are heading to a location called \"The Shrine of Folly,\" so the party monk can go on a pilgrimage. They've been told by the Goddess of Knowledge, their patron, that the shrine is home to a dragon, and that the dragon needs to be taken care of and the shrine purified.\n\n[Small but important point: we're playing a sort-of homebrewed setting, in which the Warforged were created, more-or-less by accident, by the Elves.[ Our Monk was a Warforged](http://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Zenyatta), and we had an Elf in the group, but they got along fairly well, history notwithstanding.] \n\nOn the way into the mountains, they see two figures running towards them. Turns out, they're one-half of the rival party, whose socks got rocked by said dragon. They reveal that an evil goddess has asked them to retrieve an evil artifact for her, which was a recurring theme for when she was the patron of the current party (long story). This party being agressively Lawful Good, they patch up former rival and send her on her way. \n\nThey keep going up the trail and crest the ridge--and find, below them, an old, ruined castle, partially flooded, with a strange device on top. After some dithering, they head down into the castle, and find small piles of gold and magic items in the front chamber. They poke around, and find two useful items: The Boots of Dragon Strength (+2 STR), and the Helm of Dragon Scales (+2 AC).\n\nAt that moment, the door darkened. [Scoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoria), the elder red dragon, slithers in through the door. The players are completely outclassed; a single fire breath would roast them alive, though I hint strongly that the machine on top of the roof would be enough to kill her.\n\nScoria sees them, and they scatter. She paces down the hall, and accuses them of coming to steal \"it.\" One of the fighters tries to challenge her, but she charges after him, slamming into a pillar and causing rocks to fall from the ceiling (no one died :) ). However, this left Scoria, slightly stunned, just underneath the heavy, ornate chandelier in the chamber. \n\nOne of the other players unhooks the chandelier's chain and drops it on Scoria, which pins her down long enough for them to escape. Half the party flees into the partially-flooded basement, and half to a laboratory on the second floor. \n\nThe Basement Party immediately notices a tall, freestanding pillar, sitting on the edge of a lake. Turns out to be a giant battery, still sparking to itself. As they try to edge their way around the lake, the water begins to bubble, and Scoria bursts out of it! (She had left the castle, then swum into the basement via the lake outside). She manages to bite the monk, but one of the fighters shoves over the giant battery, and, with a huge surge of lightning, Scoria is stunned and sinks back under the water.\n\n(Since Scoria could only be in one place at a time, the Laboratory Party got off scot-free. That didn't stop the party rogue from almost super-electrocuting everyone with the tesla coil intended for Scoria, though.)\n\nBoth parties meet up in a library, full of tall shelves with those fun rolling ladders on them. At one end, just below a hole in the wall, is an enormous pile of loose paper and books, the only way out. Before anyone can really do anything, Scoria crashes through a window and bellows \"INTRUDER ALERT!\"\n\nAt the sound of her voice, the fighter's Helm of Dragon Scales lets out a blinding light [and begins to scream](https://youtu.be/2E6d5j3qrss?t=16), and the rogue's Boots of Dragon Strength suddenly weigh 2,000 pounds. \n\nAs the rogue frantically tries to get the boots off, Scoria lands and does a fire breath attack. No players are in range, but she ignites a bookshelf and the heap of papers. The fighter bull-rushes the shelf and tips it over on top of Scoria, pinning her, and the bard (a flyer who had cast invisibility) flies behind Scoria and casts Thunderwave (concussive area-clearing blast) on a huge statue, which collapses on Scoria and pins her further. \n\nThe players manage to get up and out of the room by scaling the papers. They find themselves standing on an open-air walkway which leads deeper into the castle, and a balcony just above them.\n\nWell. Turns out half the party can fly (darn you, sorcerers and your Fly spells!), and one got a crit-success on his wall-jump check. About half the party gets up on the balcony, which leads to a small-ish room. As each player enters, I hand them the same note. The note provokes some knowing nods, a couple wide-eyed stares, and one or two nervous chuckles. \n\nBack at the ranch, the non-flying party charges down the walkway and into the building--and straight through a lab. At one end were several long operating tables, and, at the other end, several large iron rings are bolted to the wall. In the center of the room is a tall black obelisk covered in writing, very out of place. The players basically ignore everything and keep running up the stairs, which leads to the strange machine on the roof on one side, or to the balcony-room on the other.\n\nAt about this time, Scoria shows up. She flies into the balcony-room, then stops cold. **\"Stop,\"** she bellows.\"You *can't!\"*\n\nIn the balcony room is Scoria's small hoard of gold--and, off in the corner, her nest, with a single dragon egg inside it, very close to hatching. (This is what was causing the nervous chuckles.)\n\nThe players (to my immense relief) immediately try to talk Scoria down. After some encouragement, they ask why Scoria is even here in this place of evil, and she replies, \"Did you read the stone?\"\n\nHalf the party immediately scurries back to the lab, where, after reading the obelisk, they find that *this* is the place where the Warforged were created--and the Elves powered their experiments with the fire magic of the dragon, Scoria. She was a prisoner in this place herself, and returned here when she could find nowhere else to live. The whole castle was a shrine to arrogance and folly, and remained to remind others of their own hubris.\n\nThe party manage to convince Scoria to allow them to dedicate the shrine to the Goddess of Knowledge, and successfully convince her to stay around and be its guardian--since, after all, she is the one who knows its story best. \n\n[Yes, she is supposed to be Chaotic Evil--but she's also lived a long, traumatic life, and now wants to live quietly with her child. Plus,  the proposed course of action was awesome enough that I let it slide.] \n\nIn the middle of the conversation, the Goddess of Knowledge herself appears, primarily to help the Monk make his pre-determined transition from Monk to Knowledge Paladin, but also talked to Scoria and, essentially, made her a Cleric. \n\nThe party fixes things up and waves bye to Scoria, now a relatively-friendly red dragon and life-long ally.\n\nRight before we end, the fighter reveals that he's still wearing the helmet--which is still screaming at the top of its non-existent lungs. That really kinda killed the tension a bit :)\n\nSo that was how my party gave Cleric levels to a Red Dragon.",

        "text": "(This is my first Game Tales post, I hope you guys like it!  Civilization VI has been an excellent emergent story generator so far, and I can't wait to create more stories!)\n\nI am King Mvemba a Nzinga, but you may call me by my Christian name, Afonso I.  I rule the Kongolese Empire, and I love my people.  I have led them to greatness, building an expansive and populous empire.  Furthermore, I have always sought peaceful relations with other empires.  However, they have not always wanted peaceful relations with me.\n\nIn the realm of foreign policy, I made two great friendships: one with Theodore Roosevelt, ruler of the Americans, and one with that woman whom I detest with all my being: Queen Cleopatra of Egypt.  To the west of Cleopatra, far beyond the Kongo, lay the militaristic and expansionist Greece.  Fearing war, the queen of Egypt demanded that I gather a more formidable military to deter Greek aggression.  Although I increased my military expenditures tenfold, Egypt still demanded more.  With regret, I ended my friendship with Cleopatra.\n\nThe Kongo was growing at an unprecedented rate.  The mbanzas, neighborhoods of huts built within forests and jungles, gave cities far more available housing.  But that growth came at a price.  The Kongolese demanded luxuries - bread and circuses.  Within the bounds of my empire, I did the best I could to satisfy the people I loved.\n\nBut it was not enough.  \"More spices!  More chocolates!\" my people cried.  I was desperate.  I looked to the north, where I found the city-state of Preslav.  They had luxuries.  What's more, they were an ancient enemy of Egypt.  In my correspondence with Cleopatra, I learned that she had waged war with Preslav several times over the centuries.  Yes, with this idle military Cleopatra had ordered me to build, I would wipe out her ancient foe and regain both her favor and the favor of the Kongolese.\n\nSo my troops marched on Preslav.  Although the city-state was situated within rugged terrain, my cannon and musketry quickly pierced the inner highlands.  First fell their military encampment, then the city itself.\n\nThe Kongolese praised my efforts and ceased their cries for more amenities.  But, to my dismay, only a day after I had seized Preslav, I received a letter from my foreign minister: The Empire of Egypt had declared war upon the Kongo.  It was a trap!\n\n(In Part 2: The siege of Mbanza Kongo and the First Musketry Company's stand at the Preslav Pass)",

        "text": "We were defending on the Oil Fields. Myself, one friend and an acquaintance, remnants from earlier parties split and spilled. \n\nThe first map was an absolute walk in the park for the attacking British. Never have I witnessed such inept defending, it was embarrassing. None of us could do much either, despite finishing top three. It'll get better next map, we said. \n\nWere we wrong. There was more cohesion from our team which, while earlier seemed to be made up of people who had not once nodded heads to one another, never mind communicate about the fate of their crumbling empire, made a concerted effort to at least stick to where the objectives were. We actually managed to wear the enemy down at the last section, thanks to near constant laying of anti-tank mines and all three of us switching between classes like mad men making up for whatever hole was currently in our defensive setup. Still, the behemoth arrived and the energy had seemed to sap from our fellow countrymen's legs, as we were railroaded with over 100 tickets remaining. \n\nCometh the final map, cometh the man. The sniper man, that is, as most of our team decided this was the best course of action. And who could blame them, having been spanked like naughty school boys amidst a right jolly old knees up for his Majesty's forces, who may as well have cracked out the sun tan lotion for all the resistance they faced on this map. Indeed, surely the Sun and cancer was of a greater threat than our ne'er-do-well marksmen. One sector was lost within 15 seconds. Fifteen seconds! Many of the team did toil, and us three continued to switch between all classes, never comfortable, never in the flow, harried and harassed at every turn. \n\nBut no, my brothers, no. I was not having this. We would not have this. The last sector, our Alamo, was comprised of three areas: A, B and C. Impossible to defend, surely? Well, we would test them. They had over a hundred tickets left, as well as a spare battalion in the wings, but we would show them that the Ottoman Empire doesn't go down without a fight. \n\nAnd boy, did we give them a fight. I stuck to assault, Max to support and AJ also support. I mined all around B, which took their trucks out, I mined all around C, which took their tanks out. Max skirted left to B, and AJ would skirt right to B, and while they got stuck at C we would reclaim B, however briefly, before retreating back to take C. And we repelled them! \n\nWe couldn't believe it, and had a good laugh. They had a whole 150 tickets for one sector, with an additional behemoth that would effectively secure A. We were done, but we had our fun. \n\nOr were we? No, my friends, we were not. For we fought like lions, never before seen on the battlefield, back and fore, back and fore, and it was close, too close at times. But Tommy made a mistake - he left a tank, beat up and broken, but not beyond repair, he left it open and right next to B. I jumped in, my friends spawned on me, and we took down another ten, twenty (ok 7) men, before it blew up, me escaping my brethren not so lucky. Tommy had 60 tickets left. \n\nOur men needed their morale boosted. \"If we do this, I'm recording it all, sitting my parents down in front of the TV at Christmas, and making them watch the whole bloody thing!\" I shouted gleefully, a young boy again. We laughed, we were having fun, we were relaxed. \n\nMayhap too relaxed! AJ had started sounding drowsy, effects of the dastardly gas now doubt, but his words almost became slurred and fatigue hit him hard. But what was this? The two other, random members of our squad - they were... They were actually playing the objective! One started intermittently reviving Max, another was looking for a sniper spot and inadvertently provided a good spawning point for flanking! \n\nTheir numbers ever decreasing, the odds suddenly turned in our favour. Max - our Wilfred Owen, our Siegfried Sassoon - muttered half-intelligibly \"Oh shit, we might do this.\" But there was still a tank, heading like a cricket stump straight for our final objective to defend: C. \n\nLittle did it know there were mines upon the turf! KABOOM! It exploded, I rose up to see Max and AJ in a pincer like formation closing in on B, if only I could defend C for a few seconds more. I shot the medic down from the water cooler, gunned down an assault running toward me, whipping round to empty my magazine's last few bullets into another medic. If he didn't die, he would revive his squad and victory would be their's. But I still had my revolver, and jumping to the floor fired off a shot that brained him, as Max and AJ secured B. \n\nWe had done it! We had turned back the Empire of Britain, turned back the tide of at least 250 of her best troops, turned our last sector into a stronghold, one the great Ottaman Empire would to celebrate for centuries to come! A victory to show that no matter what the odds, the impossible *can* be achieved. ",

        "text": "&gt; Dome: YOU WILL RUE THE DAY YOU CROSSED ME, BILL! I WILL--\n\n&gt; Bill: No you won't. Goodbye.\n\n&gt; -- /u/ZetsuTheFirst, [\"Bill-Sanctioned Shenanigans\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/24wbhe/shenanigans_comiccompilation_plus_domalakazam/)\n\nSo, to recap, it was our inaugural setting in [Twitch Trolls Pokemon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TTPloreplaycentral/) For anyone who's watched [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/) (which is still a thing, in-between [Pokemon Battle Revolution betting](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon), on the stream, which is also a thing), TPP is like regular Pokemon, only completely different. And often Darker and Edgier. Which is precisely what Twitch Trolls Pokemon was well on its way to becoming, possibly even for Twitch Plays Pokemon itself. \n\nOur plucky crew of misfits had just survived an escape from the Lifeboat of Doom, with our [Zigzagoon](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Zigzagoon), Bane, in critical condition after a [Carvanha](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Carvanha) bit his tail off. Thanks to the actions of Agent 006 (aka the most awesome she-[Bibarel](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bibarel) that ever lived), we'd survived dealing with a school of [Sharpedoes](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sharpedo) that wanted to eat us, and we made port in a region called Draysten, which was entirely made up for the purpose of this roleplay (and ironically wound up canonized in another RP group's TPP-based Pokemon roleplay, which I wound up joining... but that's another story).\n\nExxy, the sentient computer program now inexplicably in human form, managed to remember that his creator, Lord Bill, presumed dead at the time (and you can tell from the wording that eventually he's gonna show up) had been in Draysten before. Which would have been fine except for two problems: one, Lord Bill was a insane criminal mastermind with psychopathic tendencies and the most hated man in the world, and two, Exxy looked almost exactly completely like Bill. My other character, Eureka, stated the obvious -- Exxy going into Draysten looking like Bill could only end in his becoming an... ex-Exxy. \n\nBill's most recognizable traits were his tousled green hair (which looked like a rat made a nest in a sewer pipe) and his fancy red coat (the last thing his wife gave him before she died of cancer, a pretty poignant plot point that has nothing whatsoever to do with this session). Eureka wisely suggested that Exxy lose both. He didn't have anything on him to cut his hair with at the time, so the best option was to quickly lose the coat.\n\nWhich wouldn't have been too bad except for problem number three: Exxy was getting a cold.\n\nDespite his constant sneezing and shivering, Exxy manned up and gave his coat to Eureka, who headed into town to find the local Pokemon Center. Exxy gave what would become his usual Heroic Sacrifice speech about how if anyone tried to murder him for looking like Bill, the rest of the group should run away as fast as possible. \n\nOf course no one else in our group would have that, but we didn't have the chance to say so before our villain, G, spoke up through the lifeboat speakers, announcing an Important Plot Point:  Bill's oldest enemy, the Dome Fossil, had heard that Bill was alive in Draysten and was coming not just for Exxy, but for our entire group, which G had conveniently described to him.\n\nIn Twitch Plays Pokemon canon, all 'fossil' Pokemon are revered, or reviled, determined by individual affiliation and opinion, as gods. The Dome Fossil was both: a controversial figure in the first run due to his association with Democracy, later on becoming more accepted by the 'Voices' who played the game, but was never viewed as sunshine and rainbows. That was more of the Root Fossil's job, although once again that was quite another story.\n\nVarying headcanons notwithstanding, Dome was NOT a god you wanted on your bad side. For starters, he [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/j7zOKE7.jpg) (artwork by /u/froggerooh) when fully evolved. For another, the interpretation of Dome in the roleplay had once sunk a continent. And practically *every* interpretation of Dome, including this one, had a severe, furious, murderous hatred of Bill for [turning him into a genderbent spider](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/241qqh/bill_sanctioned_shenanigans_hi_mr_dome_how_can/) and [locking him in a PC box.](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/243vy1/bill_sanctioned_shenanigans_spiderbro_finally/)\n\nDome was coming for us, eventually. But until that point, we had to survive.\n\nI had Eureka make it to the Pokemon Center between sessions, by virtue of starting the next session topic myself, and told everyone else to head to the Center after me. Which lead to this OOC conversation with the GM:\n\n&gt; GM: Kitty, sorry to rain in your parade, but actually plot changed \n\n&gt; Me: How so? I already read all the comments. \n\n&gt; GM: Plot changed, you were not supposed to enter town yet lol \n\n&gt; Me: Whether I was supposed to or not, I already did.\n\nI won't go any further with the details to protect the guilty (namely me). The long and short of it was that the GM let me have it, and we apologized to each other after the session (mostly for the parts that have not been printed to protect the guilty). It was a brief reprieve in a campaign that would not be known for them. But I'm getting ahead of myself here.\n\nAs every Pokemon player knows, a Pokemon Center is a hospital for Pokemon, only free. Exxy's cold had gotten worse, and he was admitted into the hospital, despite not being a Pokemon himself -- this Center also treated humans, thankfully. He'd also managed to have Agent 006 cut his hair before entering, so he looked a little less like Bill and a lot less like a rat made a nest in a sewer pipe on top of his head. \n\nThe nurse offered Exxy some pills to take to help him with his condition, which turned out to be pneumonia with [Pokerus](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9rus) added (in Twitch Plays Pokemon, Pokerus is not an entirely beneficial virus). Having only been fully human for maybe four hours, Exxy had no idea how to take a pill. Which meant that one massive spit take later, he had to have an injection, which gave the living computer program a swift introduction to sharp stabbing pain and to crying like a baby. \n\nAt least it gave Exxy an excuse to hold Eureka's hand. This continued the running gag of my friends shipping Exxy with Eureka (which was pretty much my self-insert), despite my being somewhat uncomfortable with being given a husbando based on an actual glitch I'd had a month or two before. Did it all work out in the end? Well... spoilers. But suffice to say that I don't hold it against my friends at all.\n\nAs our group reconvened over dinner (and Exxy had to learn to physically eat), we learned that G, being G, had killed off all of Agent 006's friends (the Court of the Sun, although who they were doesn't become important to this storyline until much later on) and eaten her baby. Literally eaten. And G sent a piece of the meat to us as proof. Definitely Darker and Edgier than your typical Pokemon journey.\n\nWe also learned that we had a new companion, of sorts. Major [Monferno](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Monferno), know mostly just as the Major because he was actually a Major Monogram expy in a Monferno mask, and a part of the first agency for multi-universal co-operation, known as the International Chimaera Agency Still Working On A Cool Acronym. He'd also had a negative history with Exxy, who had previously been a villain like his programmer and a bit of a hothead at times, but the Major was willing to call a truce under the circumstances. At that point, the Major was only communicating with us via webcam calls, as support from afar. This would eventually change, but not quite yet.\n\nAll together, the group at the Pokemon Center planned to go out into the wild and catch an [Abra](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Abra), which is a first-generation Pokemon that can teleport. This way, we figured, we could easily escape from Dome when and if he tried to destroy us. The GM told us that the next episode was going to be Abra-hunting, which... I don't know if he forgot or what, but that was not exactly how the next episode went at all.\n\nTo this day, none of our party has ever encountered *any* wild Abra in-RP, which ought to tell you something about how well things are likely to go according to plan in Twitch Trolls Pokemon.\n\n",

Ghazgull and the Nightbringer were going at it on some secluded end of the battlefield, when suddenly a tiny squad of Gretchin plunged into combat with the god of death, their runtherder sticking the elder god with a cattle prod to the side.  \nSee, Runtherders had this rule where their zap-sticks could reduce enemy attacks by one, but not below, it made them real useful to have in boss battles, but what stuck with me is that here's this ancient and powerful god who is associated with the very concept of death across the whole galaxy and beyond, and here he is getting tazed by some no name Ork Boy, that's what I love about the Orks.",

        "text": "A rather large group of five young men were sitting in a garage. One, spectacled, in a shirt reading ‘The Death Star was an Inside Job’, passed a burning roll of paper containing a crushed herb to the guy on his left. “There’s something I don’t quite get about it though.” “What aren’t you getting, Mitch?” asked another, who appeared to be putting together a second roll. “I mean, like, why didn’t Ulfbert stay?” Andy groaned. “Did you even listen to the podcast?” “I mean, yeah, but it was like, a while ago.” “Yeah, yesterday’s quite hazy, eh? So explain what happened in the episode.” Mitch creased his brow, deep in thought. They could see memories bubbling up to the top of his head, and finally lifted him enough to speak. “Okay. Before they got there, Geldin spoke to Ulfbert:\n\n“Any chance ye’re stayin’ in Conaghy, then?”\n\nUlfbert looked at Geldin silently, and appeared to think seriously. He turned his head to one of the others briefly, and back to Geldin. “I don’t know yet. We’ve still got a few days before we get there. I’m sure I’ll make up my mind by then.” He moved his horse a little closer to Geldin’s, “I’ll tell you one thing, Furrio’s not the one without supernatural power in the prophecy. I can’t decide if I think it’s me, or if Sillith was right, but there’s no getting around prophecies one way or another.”\n\n“I don’ know what ye mean really, tha’ stuff’s na’ my callin’, nah. I jes know I’d miss ye’s all.”\n\nUlfbert was silent for a minute. As he opened his mouth to speak, Furrio shouted, “Stop!” Everybody stopped their mounts. “Did anyone hear that?”\n\nAra’k-azur looked up into the treetops above. “Now I do. Sky Bite, go investigate.” Sky Bite blinked into the treetops for a moment, and blinked straight down. He let out an excited yelp on arrival. “Oh no!” the Orc called, “I *hate* spiders!”\n\nFurrio quickly threw a bolt of fire into the air above him, apparently not hitting anything, as three dark shapes hit the ground from the treetops, surrounding Sillith. Sillith drew her rapier, and thrust it into the nearest object without looking, and she cried out when she saw the horse-sized arachnid she’d just skewered. She pulled the sword back, and it jumped at her, trying to bite.\n\nSantabane jumped over the other spiders, and killed the furthest in one powerful chomp, as Ara’k-azur slashed with his poleaxes at the next nearest. A dozen or so more spiders dropped down, surrounding the party, and cutting Ara’k-azur off from the others. Furrio lit his blade ablaze, and cut cleanly through the nearest one. It exploded in magical energy, injuring the nearest two. Two more of the spiders leapt for Sillith, but Ulfbert stopped them, blocking with his combat shield, and beat them back. Sillith used the opportunity to bleed one dry magically, and had her father dismount and start chopping at another. The spiders surrounding the group were dealt with completely before anyone was injured.\n\nAra’k-azur himself had killed a few with his axes, but soon they overpowered him. One bit deep into his face beside the left eye, but Santabane returned the favour in the thing’s abdomen, apparently killing it. The remaining few spiders tried to escape, but these were finished by Ara’k-azur, his dogs, and lastly a fireball from Furrio, which did not kill it outright, but finished it some time later when it burned to death.\n\n“So now you can throw fire,” stated Ulfbert, nonplussed.\n\n“Looks like it,” replied Furrio.\n\n“Then why did we endanger Ara’k-azur’s dog the last couple times we needed fire?”\n\n“Wasn’t my decision.”\n\n“And how come we’re only now finding out about it?”\n\n“Nobody asked.”\n\n“Oh, what an excuse! So now-”\n\nA loud thump drew attention to the grounded Orc, who seemed to have lost balance and fallen off Santabane. Ulfbert quickly dismounted, and went to Ara’k-azur’s side. “He’s been poisoned,” said Ulfbert. “Those things must’ve been venomous.”\n\n“They’re called Vektiss if that helps,” offered Furrio.\n\n“It does. Ara’k-azur’s gonna be in pain and immobile for a little bit, but when the venom passes he’ll be fine. Shouldn’t take more than a day.” Ulfbert spotted some weeds growing at the base of a nearby tree, and started pulling them. “I’ll grind this to a paste that’ll relieve some of the pain. Better than doing nothing.”\n\nSillith’s voice was near a shout, “so we have to stay here a whole day? And we have all these brand new spider corpses?”\n\n“Umm, yes?”\n\nSillith jumped off her horse, and started unpacking some rather nasty looking tools. She set upon one of the spiders, and started carving into it, seemingly at random. Everyone thought better of asking what she was doing, until mid-morning of the following day.\n\n***\n\nGeldin was sitting under a tree next to Ulfbert, both unable to look away from Sillith’s work. After hours of tireless work, Sillith rose up and  shot some green energy from her hands into the thing. Its exoskeleton appeared to heat up, and all of the flesh melted and poured out of the various stab wounds and orifices of the thing. Seemingly impartial to the bits of brain it was vomitting, the thing rose up of its own accord, and faced Sillith. Geldin shot up and screamed obscenities, but Ulfbert simply sat, staring at the monstrosity. Sillith whispered to it in some ancient tongue or other, then stood back. The spider-that-was, now clean of any flesh, turned to Geldin and waved one of its legs at him. Geldin gagged, but managed to wrest control of his stomach in the end, apparently devoting too much brainpower to that task to avoid shouting, “ye’re a necromancer!”\n\nUlfbert calmly rose and put a hand on Geldin’s shoulder. “You must’ve seen that her ‘father’ hasn’t a face under his cloak now, Geldin. We’ve been travelling near two weeks together. That ‘man’ is a skeleton.”\n\n“Huh, I’m impressed you saw that, Ulfy,” said Sillith, “Y’know I’ve got this spell that makes people not look at my pets? You must be pretty smart if it didn’t work on you!”\n\nUlfbert shrugged. “You get to my age without dying, you’ve picked up a few things. One of the things I’ve picked up is, ‘always look a gift sword in the mouth,’ but another is, ‘the necromancer of my enemies is my ally.’ You’re immature, hard to pin down, and if I were religious I’d call you an aberration, but I’ve seen enough to know whose side you’re on.”\n\nGeldin put his mace away, “tha’s somethin’ thar. I don’ trus’ a necromancer as far as I can trow ‘is biggest zombeh, bu’ I guess I migh’ as well stay wit’ you lot to Conaghy. G’luck t’ye, Ulfbert, in dealin’ wit’ *‘er* when I’m gone. I fear fer ye.”\n\n“I’m not worried,” said Furrio, “like Ulfbert says, more firepower on our side is a good thing.”\n\nSillith appeared satisfied and went back to work on the next spider. Shortly after she finished, late in the day, Ara’k-azur woke up. When Ulfbert asked him how he felt, he responded, “I think I’m fine other than my eye.”\n\n“What’s wrong with your eye?”\n\n“It’s been hurting and I couldn’t see out of it since that last dungeon. I’m starting to think it’s broken.”\n\n***\n\n*Andy interrupted. “So you’re telling me that what you remember is that he tells them about his eye after the spiders.” Mitch looked to the side. “Yeah, I guess.” Zach said, “I think he would’ve said something earlier.” “Maybe,” Mitch replied, “anyway, his eye was all screwed up. I think it said he never saw from it again.” “Maybe the venom or Ulfbert’s salve messed it up.” “No way,” said Andy, “Ulfbert knows his stuff, and he said he’d be fine. If anything Ara’k-azur’s just too cool to say anything about losing an eye.” Mitch inhaled some smoke, waited for the others to stop, and continued his retelling.*\n\n***\n\nThe party approached the borders of Conaghy, trailed by two undead spiders. A few dozen meters^1 from the edge of the forest a sort of barricade wall had been erected since the party had left. “I don’t think that was the people’s doing,” said Ulfbert. “They’ve never done something like it before.”\n\n“I see people walking around on the wall,” said Furrio.\n\nSky Bite blinked to the wall and back. Ara’k-azur relayed Sky Bite’s intelligence, “they’re blighted nyss.”\n\nGeldin took off his helmet. “Haen save us, they must’ve killed them all. All me friends, me kin, ther all gone.” Ulfbert rode closer to him, and put a supportive hand on his shoulder. Geldin looked up at the blacksmith, with the sort of twisted expression that can never be relayed by sound. “Ye’re me only friend now.”\n\n“And I’m chopped liver,” muttered Sillith.\n\n“We’ve got work to do,” said Ulfbert, trying to distract Geldin. “We don’t have the supplies to get to any other town from here, let alone New Aurora.”\n\n“Why do you say New Aurora?” asked Sillith.\n\n“We need to research the prophecy,” said Furrio. “There’s nothing we can really do until we know more about it, or the Blight.”\n\n“I already told you about the prophecy! You don’t need some stuffy wizard’s view of it, bards are the real experts on this stuff, and I’m basically a bard.”\n\n“You’re a soul-weaver, not a song-weaver.”\n\n“I’m both! The only thing I don’t weave is baskets!” Sillith took out her Harmonica and started to make a racket.\n\n“Quiet! Don’t let the nyss know we’re here!” said Ara’k-azur. “We’ll need every advantage to sneak past this wall to steal supplies, and noise-making is not an advantage.” Ara’k-azur looked at Sillith sternly, but his expression quickly lightened. He looked at Hot Dog, and the Spiders. “Ulfbert, are you any good at starting fires?”\n\nUlfbert fingered some runes on the trim of his armour, and smiled.\n\n***\n\nBy Furrio’s request, they waited for the following day. Geldin was grateful for a few hours with which he could perform a ceremonial funeral for his wife, and the others all attended respectfully. Even Sillith resisted the urge to make some comments about undeath or the dark god Neth or fluffy adorable spiders. \n\n***\n\nA little after dawn, two blighted Nyss patrolling the edge of the wall saw smoke rising up from the base of the wall below them. The taller of the two leaned over and looked at the base of the wall, and discovered an Orc riding a large white wolf, next to a small red wolf that was breathing fire on the base of the wall. The wall, made quickly out of refuse, wood, and mud, had not yet been enchanted to resist flame, and so the first Nyss immediately used a small tool at her belt to create blue sparks at the tip of an arrow wrapped in fabric. When this went alight in cool blue fire, she launched this into the air as a signal, and turned her attention to the wolves.\n\nHer partner had already launched a couple of arrows at the insurgents, and missed both times. The red wolf seemed satisfied with the quantity of fire now sustaining itself at the base of the wall, and sped off into the forest with the Orc and other wolf. She knocked an arrow and drew, took careful aim at the red wolf, followed it, saw its path, lead it, she didn’t let it go, she noticed the wind, calculated, thought hard, adjusted, fired. A yelp confirmed her skill in marksmanship, and she turned proudly to her partner beside her. Her smile faltered quickly as she saw another signal come up from the opposite end of the wall, and a billow of smoke a good deal closer.\n\n***\n\nUlfbert never feared fire. Maybe when he was a kid he’d been startled, burned himself, seen something burned, but if so we’d never know it. He’d become interested in smithing at a young age, learned from his father, from his father before him and that whole story. Fire was the servant of his family, and helped them with their metal wares. It is this revere for flame that could be seen in the function of his precious armour. Though he did not work with magical flame himself, he’d had some imbued in his finished product, and used it now.\n\nUlfbert rode slowly beside the wall, his arm outreached touching it. Flames licked up around his steel-clad appendage, and spread to some of the spots he’d touched. Behind him, smoke was starting to rise up. A few Nyss were running along the wall, chasing him or running from the building fire, and shooting arrows at him. Several were hitting quite consistently, but the armour did much more than heat up; it protected, and Ulfbert knew his craft, so it protected well too. When he was at the end of the forest, beyond which he would no longer have easy escape, he still had no scratch on him. He pulled away, satisfied, and made for the meeting place in the woods.\n\nPerhaps he had been going too slowly for too long; three riders on antlered beasts were behind him, and followed swiftly.\n\n***\n\nA second spider climbed up the wall, and jumped on a nyss archer who was about to launch the distress signal. The first had taken some damage, but was still going after killing two nyss on its own. The melee was getting bloody fast, and the nyss present at the gate were getting worried. Finally one dodged away from the second spider, picked up the still-lit distress arrow, and fired it. These monstrosities were bad enough, but they were being blasted by magic from the ground below, and it was just too much to handle. The archer felt some hope when he saw a half-dozen more nyss come from the encampment in town, though why so many were streaming to other places on the wall with buckets, he couldn’t guess. When riders chased the spell-slinger away, he thought that he just might survive the day, and it was at this moment that the spider sliced through his neck. The last thing he saw was that same spider jumping off him, running down the wall, and crawling into the forest after the spellcaster.\n\n***\n\nThe swiftest rider caught up to Ulfbert very easily. He had his longsword drawn, and expertly guided the beast with his legs, poised to strike. It was remarkable how slow the human’s animal was, perhaps it was totally unused to running through the rough terrain of the forest floor. The rider swung at Ulfbert, as his comrades’ arrows bounced off the glistening armour. Ulfbert blocked the sword with little effort, then stabbed with his spear in the same movement. The rider fell, wounded, and was left behind.\n\nUlfbert turned around, and charged the next nearest rider. He pulled back too late, and more or less skewered himself on Ulfbert’s spear. The last rider saw she was beat, and retreated. Ulfbert dismounted to finish off the fallen rider, and, satisfied, rode to the meeting place.\n\n***\n\n“They’re up this tree,” said one of the two remaining nyss, dismounting. The other dismounted as well, bow drawn.\n\n“I can’t shoot them if I can’t see them.”\n\n“Not to worry, I’ll burn them out. Cover me.”\n\nThe first nyss took out the sparking tool, thought again, and pulled out a tinderbox. “They’re as good as ours,” he said, as he sparked some tinder at the base of the tree.\n\n***\n\nFurrio joined the other three at the meeting place, and dropped the supplies he’d stolen on the ground. It was easily enough to cover their trip to New Aurora, plus some special ingredients Ulfbert had asked for. “Where’s Sillith?” he asked.\n\n“She’sn’t returned,” replied Geldin. “How’d ye get these without bein’ seen?”\n\n“I have my ways. Besides, the distractions really helped.”\n\n“I jus’ hope Sillith survived providin’ her share of trouble.”\n\n***\n\nThe second spider dropped on the second nyss. The first, engulfed in flames, staggered back, and Sillith rushed out of hiding to put out the fire at the base of the tree. “Good job, you cuddly thing!” she said. “That was clever using his fire against him there!” She softly pet the thing’s head, as the sound of one nyss burning played against the sounds of the other being disemboweled. It gave her an idea for a song she thought she’d sing to the others when she returned. \n\n“There’s no way Furrio’s going to succeed, I can’t believe we sent that lumbering *warrior* to sneak in,” she said to the spider. “I can’t wait to kill more nyss! We’re going to be here for days doing this stuff! I bet we can even reanimate some and make them fight each *other*! This is so much better than travelling all the time.”\n\n***\n\n\nIn the third week of travel between towns, Sillith asked Furrio how he escaped Conaghy unseen for the 17th time. For the 17th time, Furrio told her that he had his ways. This was the most disappointed she’d been so far to hear this excuse, and resolved not to bother asking again. One hour later, Sillith asked Furrio how he escaped Conaghy unseen for the 18th time.\n\n***\n\n ^1 As far as I can tell, measurements in Kephrea are pretty close to the metric scale.

        "text": "This story takes place in a game played during a road trip. It starts with the main offender of the tale in fact. On the way back from Seattle in July of 2014, four friends crammed into one Prius decided to play a road-trip game on the way back to D.C. The names will be abbreviated as T, A, C (narrator), and ***I*** (will be italicized and bolded for the story to differentiate from the personal I). \n\nT had the great idea of asking A (who was our dm) if we could roll d20s for stats. A accepted under the condition that you roll once and keep all the results. T rolled amazingly high, with only one score below 10 (which he put in his Charisma); he played a Kobold Grapple-Monk. ***I*** rolled pretty average, with only one high stat (which he put in Charisma); he played a Half-orc Draconic Sorcerer (for flavor, he was born with the scales). C rolled three great scores, two abysmally low, and one average; he played a Dwarf Plant-Growth Druid with a 3 Dexterity and 5 Charisma. \n\nT's kobold was a wandering monk who was on a quest to become strong enough to wrestle and defeat a devil that killed his kobold tribe. ***I***'s half-orc was an illusionist that made money playing minor tricks on the street for dwarves and humans. C's dwarf was the mining-town farmer that grew mushrooms from the town's waste. He always kept a few stashed in his beard and he often smelled of the shit he clumsily fell into. He grew poisonous mushrooms that were edible to dwarves but almost deadly to the humans in their town a few miles away. Oh and the dwarf also wore a beerhat. As if he didn't look dumb enough, he was also perpetually drunk.  \n\nThe meat of the story picks up when we were trying to cross a mountain range. Because of his high Constitution score and his single Barbarian level, C's Dwarf was often the front-liner, letting one or two people get by so T's kobold could grapple one and I's half-orc could kill the other with his greatsword. While crossing the mountains, a band of orcs attacked us in the night, and the trio was in danger. As T and ***I*** were busy killing off the stragglers, C was busy fighting an orc barbarian... and losing. When C fell (With a 16 Constitution score, he was at -13, important later), ***I*** and T hurried over and killed the raging barbarian in a battle that almost got themselves killed.\n\nHeavily injured and with an unconscious Dwarf, the surviving two set up camp in a corner and set about their special healing process for C. T used his tribe's special \"Moon Treatment\" to help C's dwarf recover without being finished off by a hungry wolf. This \"Moon Treatment\" involved covering the unconscious Dwarf in as much shit and detritus as possible to mask the scent of his blood and injury, while burying him in a hole that left only his head above ground so he could breathe. His head was covered with leaves and the piss-and-shit scent had to be replenished occasionally to ensure no beast would think a tasty dwarf was there.\n\nAfter the first night of this, ***I***'s Half-orc realized that this was a shitty plan (pun VERY intended), and they decided to just push through the mountains without sleep and get him to the town on the west side of the mountains (they were travelling west, so this was their destination anyway). Through four days of recovering without any magical way of healing, C had finally recovered enough hit points to be one day away from recovery (he was at -1 hit points).\n\nThen the worst happened. T had an idea. I'll try to summarize the conversation as best I can.\n\nT: Hey A, I have a question.\n\nA: Sure, what do ya got?\n\nT: If beer-hats exist in this world, then shouldn't defibrillators?\n\nA: *sigh* You don't have a defibrillator though. \n\nT: Yeah but **I** can cast Shocking Grasp, the same principle should apply, right?\n\nA: You can try.\n\n**I**: All right, that night after some discussion about this, I cast Shocking Grasp on C's hairy chest.\n\nA: Okay roll 3d6.\n\nT: Wait why is he rolling for damage you said it would work‽\n\nA: No, I said you could try. I made no promises about it's ability to work.\n\n***I***: shit, I rolled 14.\n\nC: **WHAT THE EVERLIVING FUCK NOW I'M EVEN CLOSER TO DEATH THAN I WAS WHEN THE ORC KNOCKED ME UNCONSCIOUS‽**\n\nA: All right, C is now at -15 hit points, stable, and has a large hand print burn scar above his heart. \n\nT: Oh sorry C, I didn't think it would hurt you.\n\nC: **A BEER HAT AND A DEFIBRILLATOR ARE ON TWO DIFFERENT TECH-LEVELS WHAT THE HELL!**\n\nT: No hard feelings? \n\nC: *sigh* I'm stuck in the car with you for another 1300 miles, so yeah, I'll try to let it go.\n\nMiraculously, C survived with just a fraction of health. Realizing they'd almost killed C, ***I*** and T decided to seek out a professional healer. The town had a mayor who had taken the position by force, a wizard that claimed he was powerful, but was really just level 5. He forbade any other magic users from using their magic in town, and included alchemy. The town healer was an alchemist that lived outside of town about a mile. She came into town each morning and left each evening. This was allowed by the mayor-wizard because she didn't actually brew in town, just sell. \n\nSo ***I*** and T sat by the West Gate from sunrise when it opened to around noon, looking for this healer. After a while, they realized they'd never actually figured out what the healer looked like, so they were just sitting around like idiots for half the day. They decided to ask where the healer lived and sought her out the next evening. Finally, C was able to recover, though when he woke up, he found the Handprint-burn-scar had healed improperly and was now a golden-colored scar; and worse, it was permanent. \n\nBut finally, the trio was whole again, and ready to set out for their next dumb adventure, but that's a tale for another time. (Also, sorry if the formatting is off, this is my first post to Gametales). ",

        "text": "Okay, so this is just one story in a campaign full of weird bullshit. For starters, some background. This is a Pathfinder semi-homebrew campaign based around a pirate crew. We got the game all set up with serious pirate characters and a serious pirating world and a serious kingdom-endangering curse happening in the background.\n\nOur first session out, we get to the gates of the main city and our arcanist immediately tells the guards that we're pirates. \n\nSo that sets the precedent for the rest of the campaign. We end up calling ourselves the Wing King Pirates. Our jolly roger is a crossed chicken wing and a blunt. Our battle cry is \"wing kiiiiing\" in a comically low voice. We've made our beds and now we must sleep in them.\n\nSo in this particular session when the story occurs, we're actually on land. We're pretty shitty pirates. We've done a total of one maritime battle before moving to land for the rest of the campaign. \n\nAnyway, we're in a gnoll fortress at this point. These are \"snolls\" by the dm's description, so they live in cold, snowy areas. \n\nWe've been through a lot of bullshit in this snoll fortress. To get in, we had to fight a frog that looked like Donald Trump. Then there was a bunch of funhouse-style building traps that we had to navigate to get further into the fortress. \n\nImportant to the story: one of our running themes for this session was to convince random snolls that things we did were actually the work of Keith, a particularly shitty snoll who keeps eating other people's lunches in the break room and fucking up the traps. \n\nNear the end of our time in the fortress, we came across a guard group of snolls near a weird fountain with black liquid. We couldn't convince them to chill out, and we couldn't catch them, either. What we could do was have our bard play some music to try to get them to calm down.\n\nIt works on one female snoll. She stays behind and listens to the bard play. Our barbarian rolls to try and sing for it so she can seduce the snoll. She rolls a 2 and the snolls nearly leaves.\n\nI, playing the gunslinger, roll to perform as well to try to get it to stay. I manage to get an 18. It stays and eventually wanders over to us.\n\nBarbarian grabs it and picks it up so it can't get away. While we have this captive snoll, our argument over what to do with it diverges into three camps:\n\nA. Let the snoll go because this is getting weird\nB. Interrogate the snoll about the rest of the fortress and this weird fountain we're standing near\nC. Throw the snoll in the fountain. The snoll does not want to be thrown in the fountain.\n\nEventually, we begrudgingly move to throw the snoll in the fountain. The snoll slips under the black water and then bursts out, having mutated into a terrifying monster. \n\nWe're fucked. So we start fighting this huge, crazy-strong snoll. When we're about halfway done with it, the guard party comes back with another, even bigger mutated snoll in tow. \n\nShit. We will never get through that guy.\n\nSo we turn to the party alchemist. He tries to bluff his way out of this travesty. The bigger mutant snoll (named Hee-haw. seriously.) is clearly angry because he told the female snoll (Khala) never to go near the fountain. Hee-haw, though, is a pretty rational (?) snoll and listens to us. \n\nWhile listening to us, he murders Khala by tearing her face off. Just to drive home how terrifying he is.\n\nWe somehow successfully convince Hee-Haw that Keith told Khala to hop in the fountain, that we're just very, very lost, and that all the random murders were not our fault. He believes us, but makes us fight him for our honor anyway.\n\nSo while we're fighting Hee-Haw, I keep some 40-50 feet away from Hee-Haw at all times. However, I'm attacked by a random smaller snoll (unmutated) and have to fend him off. The party barbarian comes to help me.\n\nI try to stab the snoll with my bayonet. I roll a 1, stab the barbarian, and somehow manage to shoot her while pulling my bayonet out. She's dead.\n\nEventually, we manage (somehow?) to get Hee-Haw down to 1 health. He concedes we're honorable and we get to stay in the snoll village for a little while to heal up.\n\nAfter we rest up, we move out to a new area. We pick up a snoll character along the way to replace the barbarian. Immediately after this, we find a huge black monolith in an ice cave. This, we think, is the source of the wintry curse plaguing the kingdom. \n\nThe dm says the monolith is basically a direct reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey. So we tell it some impossible math problems (asking it about parallel lines, etc) which make it explode a little, then press one button and leave. Curse fixed.\n\nWe live in a really strange campaign.",

        "text": "So, I teach protestant religion in our school. Because of the Belgian constitutian everybody can be taught their own religious beliefs in school, which leaves us protestants with very small classgroups (About 1% of the population considers itself protestant (this goes from reformed to evangelical to pentecostal).\n\nNow in this case I am teaching two seven year olds and the theme for this moment is friendship and teamwork. Having seen all the story and theory that was needed, I thought by myself: \"It would be pretty cool to test this knowledge out by roleplaying.\" And so I choose the carebears as a theme and made a very simple dicepool system.\n\nBasically your carebear had a name and a talent. Their talent would be depicted on the drawing on their tummy. When you try to do something important: Roll 4d6. If you use your talent: Roll two extra dice. Every die that was rolled 4 or more was a success. Depending on the difficulty there would be need for a certain amount of successes.\n\nSomething I learned immediately is that I'm getting old, since none of the pupils of two of my clases knew the carebears. A real shame that! But then again, it gave us more narative freedom. I kept it all animal based.\n\nWhat I also learned is that they still scare easily, even if it is just make belief. They did not dare to talk to the angry looking bear! Not even if their talents were giving gifts and saying nice things, which would otally have calmed the bear down! So what do you do? You change the story and start over.\n\nNow I had shown them the example characters I had made beforehand and so when they got a letter from mister turtle (Actual prop! They love reading at that age because it's still so new for them but they are getting good at it!) to ask for their help because there is a big rock that has fallen in front of the door to his hole, they went to take a look. It was a big rock! I had set the difficulty so that it would be impossible to lift it if only one of them tried.\n\nIt's then that they got creative! They asked me if they could ask the bears I had shown them as examples, to which I agreed. They should call them on the phone. The gift giving bear gave the other bear a phone as a gift and they called them. The other bear's talent was saying nice things, which in a previous adventure she had been able to upgrade to an extra talent called politeness, so she did her best to convince the other bears. Two of the four could come, of which one had a relevant talent (teamwork) And so all of the dice were rolled, I think 18 in total, with which they succeeded very well, and within the goal for the game, to showcase friendship and teamwork.",

        "text": "I feel that our party’s most recent character death deserves a tale worthy of a tuesday morning telenovela, drenched in betrayal and disaster of the foulest type.  \n\nHere, I write of the murder of our beloved Ellaria Havenshow.  \n\nThere was none like her, in this campaign or any other.  An elf raised by dwarves, driven to the perfection of the smith’s craft, she created a device which could throw bullets with deadly accuracy.  Beloved for her down-to-earth nature and wry sense of humor, Ellaria led the party unerringly in the path most practical.  She was singular among the group, our gunslinging elf.  The sorcerer listened to her; the revenant obeyed her; the child-druid adored her; the wild man respected her.  And she always kept her word.\n\nYet the cursed land of Barovia was her undoing.  From the moment she stepped beyond its boundaries, the demon Strahd had marked her- for her bright hair, reminiscent of his beloved.  To him, she was an abomination- Tatyana’s hair on an elven form, who spoke with a dwarf’s tongue- he singled her out as the first to fall.  But Ellaria found a kindred spirit in Ireena Kolyana, and pledged her clan name to protecting her and her brother Ismark.  And she always kept her word.\n\nIt was on a bridge, far above the deadly waters below, that the first breach of trust occurred.  Rising from the mist, Strahd attacked with the risen bodies of those the party had already killed.  While the others struggled with the foul undead, Strahd approached Ellaria, standing steadfast before her charges.  And with a spell and a few words, he twisted her mind against her.  The devil Strahd sowed doubt in her mind of her newest allies, Ireena and Ismark.  As she stepped aside, confusion coloring her judgement, Strahd struck.  With a gust of magical wind, he pitched Ismark over the brink, to fall to his death hundreds of feet below.  And Ellaria’s word was broken.\n\nWith a cruel laugh, Strahd departed, leaving only the hacked, twitching remains of their twice-killed enemies.  But rather than band together, the party dissolved into argument- who could they trust?  Who was the spy who had told him their location?  They retreated to a nearby cave rather than venture onward, but more misfortune was yet to come.  A phantom approached in the night, weaving wistfully through the trees to their makeshift camp.  Singing of its loss, it entered unbothered by the guard, who was more preoccupied with keeping the party from killing each other than with surprise attacks.  It let loose a ghastly scream, terrifying some few- but not Ellaria, stalwart dwarven soul.  And not Ireena, broken with grief and wanting vengence.  Both stood, on opposite sides of the specter, and both attacked simultaneously.  But while Ireena’s sword slid harmlessly through, Ellaria’s bullet travelled faster.  As Ireena fell, her life’s blood spilled by hands sworn to protect her, Ellaria cried out: “In Moradin’s name, why won’t you die already!”  Betraying her deity, her solemn oath, and her clan name, Ellaria’s word was shattered.\n\nIt was not until the next day that the effects of her actions would be felt.  Distrusted by her companions, Ellaria was locked in a room while they decided what to do with her.  They took her weapons and armor, and left a guard on her door.  But when the spell faded and Ellaria was forced to confront all of her actions the previous day, her failures and traitorous words and deeds, her mind broke.\n\nWhen the party finally decided to confront Ellaria, they found a very confused elf unlike herself- who didn’t remember her party members or their quest.  Horrified by such madness, they ordered her to stay while they argued over how- and if- to cure her.  Unwilling to sit passively by and let strangers decide her fate, Ellaria decided to take matters into her own hand, and do some exploring.  Wandering the streets of the town, she saw strange and horrifying things.  A doll shop with strangely familiar faces staring out the window at her, accusingly.  Wretched people dressed in donkey’s heads locked into the stocks, who moaned pitifully as she passed.  Ravens with too-intelligent looks.  Eyes both familiar and not, gleaming at her out of the shadows.  The glint of lantern light on sharp teeth, as they attacked.\n\nThe party came running when they heard her scream of fury, and the battle was one for the great tales of the bards.  The living, fighting their dead predecessors- one long-toothed vampire spawn for each of them, leaving the party hopelessly overmatched.  And they stood their ground, protecting their ally against these undead predators.  Even if, afflicted with amnesia, she did not remember them.  \n\nThe revenant took on two alone, dealing wounds that the spawn healed almost as quickly.  The sorcerer dealt blow after blow, scattering ice and frost across their battlefield.  The child-druid called on the power of the moon, burning the undead with radiant flames and calling on the creatures of Barovia to help them.  And the wild man laid about like a man possessed, never letting them retreat from justice.  It was no good.  The child-druid was hauled to the rooftops, held powerless before falling to the ground far below.  \n\nWith just a glimmer, Ellaria remembered a promise once given- to be bestest friends and always help each other, and never fight.  She ran to the child-druid, heedless of the danger, and kept him from dying.  In that instant, the sorcerer had a brilliant idea.  With the power of an illusion and a knack for mimicry, he created a booming voice from above them.  A cold, aristocratic voice which every being living or dead knew to fear- that of Strahd.  The sorcerer ordered the vampires, in Strahd’s voice, to stand and accept their fates at the hands of the newcomers.  Almost, they did.\n\nBut there was another, invisible presence in their battle.  One with a long memory, and a penchant for cruelty.  His voice came from over the sorcerer’s shoulder, whispering congratulations- Strahd himself.  He imitated the other’s magic, throwing a spell at another party member which looked like betrayal, before fading into the night again.  Chaos erupted, as the vampires attacked once more with vicious intent- only to be stopped.  “You have your orders,” were Strahd’s bone-chilling words.  So the spawn faded into the shadows, retreating over the rooftops of the town.\n\nStrahd found his prey, however, huddled over the unconscious body of a child she barely remembered.  Without a word, he took Ellaria’s life, in an act of unintelligible vengeance.  As a last act of spite, he even spirited away her body.\n\nThe party wandered the streets of the city, pursued by shadows and illusions and Strahd’s taunting laughter.  They never saw him, nor Ellaria’s body- only her blood, smeared on each of their faces in the twisting darkness.  They were left without closure.  Any hope of safety or survival was wiped away, and only despair and vengeance live in their hearts.\n\n[I found myself writing this for one of my players, amazing storyteller which he is.  He plays his characters so honestly, he pushes the entire game to new heights.  He's done everything from horrified, hopeful, furious, charmed, broken, amnesiac, and finally one of the best death scenes I have ever seen- all in three three-hour games.  Don't worry, Ellaria isn't gone forever (and if any of my players see this, shhhh).  But with the party out for blood, things are about to get a lot more interesting.\n\nIn case you didn't catch on, we're playing the WotC Curse of Strahd module with 5 players: Ellaria, the wood elf/dwarven gunslinger (courtesy Mercer), a half-elf child-druid, wild man the human druid, a half-elf sorcerer, and a drow revenant rogue/fighter (the edgiest of edgelords)  If you guys enjoyed reading this, I might keep posting next week's session.]\n\n[tl;dr good RP will make the GM weepy and the game so much more interesting]",

This is not about that. This is about the game of Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf I ended up playing with the 3 relatives who had never played any sort of Tabletop RPG before. \n\nBefore I begin, might I just say that the Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf RPG is excellent for beginners to TTRPGs\n\nLet me start by listing the characters and the setting\n\nSetting: Small town amusement park home to Shia LaBeouf where the workers willfully trap visitors to feed his hunger\n\nCharacters:\n\n&gt;Clark Lawrenson: A 28-year-old American marine biologist with a two-liter bottle of Pacific seawater that he thought had a jellyfish in it but actually didn't\n\n&gt;Throckmorton (Throck) Coflagen: A 23-year-old Czechoslovakian accountant who was on vacation. He had a billy club for some reason.\n\n&gt;Jebediah Menards: An 18-year-old Amish dude on his Rumspringa. He found a weed-whacker in a bush.\n\n****\n\n&gt;Clark got trapped in the bumper cars\n\n&gt;Throck got stranded on the roller coaster\n\n&gt;Jeb was left on top off the ferris wheel\n\n&gt;The park shuts down\n\n&gt;Night falls\n\n&gt;Half moon so there's some light\n\n&gt;Their rides start moving, freeing them\n\n&gt;The rides shut down once they're off\n\n&gt;They all head toward the main gate\n\n&gt;It's locked and there's a fence around the park with barbed wire\n\n&gt;They do some basic introductions\n\n&gt;They decide to group up to look for keys\n\n&gt;Look at map in front of park entrance\n\n&gt;They are in south-west corner with ticket booths and office\n\n&gt;Center has carrossel\n\n&gt;South is concession stands and stuff\n\n&gt;South-east is bumper cars and a little maintenance shed behind it\n\n&gt;East is one of those spinning leg thing rides. You know, the ones with planes or whatever.\n\n&gt;North-east is the only roller-coaster\n\n&gt;North is a bunch of scam carnival games\n\n&gt;North-west is the ferris wheel\n\n&gt;They figure keys would be in the office if anything\n\n&gt;Go to check\n\n&gt;Enter park proper\n\n&gt;See figure on highest point of roller-coaster\n\n&gt;Figure sees them\n\n&gt;Jumps off of coaster\n\n&gt;40-ft. drop at least\n\n&gt;Lands in overgrowth\n\nClark: You saw that guy, yeah\n\nOthers: Yeah\n\nClark: Was he up there when you were stuck?\n\nThrock: No\n\n&gt;They agree to keep an eye out\n\n&gt;Make it to office\n\n&gt;Unlocked\n\n&gt;Lucky them\n\n&gt;Clark agrees to keep watch while the other two look through the office\n\n&gt;He has a two-liter of salt water\n\n&gt;They find a set of keys and a Swiss Army knife\n\n&gt;Jeb takes keys and Throck takes the knife but doesn't write it down and everyone forgets about it for the rest of the game\n\n&gt;Also find a board of unlabeled buttons and switches\n\n&gt;Agree to press one\n\n&gt;Let Clark know they're pressing a button\n\n&gt;Turns on carrossel\n\n&gt;Clark informs them as such\n\n&gt;Shia suddenly attacks from the bumper car pit\n\n&gt;He leaps across the tops of concession stands and lunges directly at Clark\n\nClark: Holy shit, it's Shia LaBeouf\n\n&gt;Gets slammed against the wall but it doesn't do more than bruise\n\n&gt;Gets thrown aside but still remains relatively unhurt\n\n&gt;Shia rushes the office door only to get a billy club across the head\n\n&gt;Shia flees toward the ferris wheel, clutching his temple\n\n&gt;They decide to check the shed by the bumper cars since Shia might be watching the main gate\n\n&gt;They sneak through the concessions and hop the fence next to the bumper car pit\n\n&gt;Get to the shed and start trying keys\n\n&gt;Shia is back\n\n&gt;Charges them\n\n&gt;Throck readies billy club\n\n&gt;Clark readies water bottle\n\n&gt;Shia leaps over both of them and crashes through the roof of the shed\n\n&gt;Shia is crashing around in shed\n\n&gt;The three hide around the corner\n\n&gt;Shia blasts door open and charges forward\n\n&gt;Knocks down fence in front of shed\n\n&gt;Tears part of the wall of the bumper pit revealing wires\n\n&gt;Live wires contact fence\n\n&gt;Entire fence around the park is electric\n\nYes, I know it wouldn't cover the whole fence, but I went with movie logic\n\n&gt;Enter shed to see what's still intact\n\n&gt;Two pairs of hedge clippers, another weed whacker, and a safe with one of those twisty locks\n\nThrock: If you put your water bottle on the safe you can watch for its vibrations when the tumblers fall into place\n\nI was expecting the safe to remain a mystery, but that suggestion was so unexpected and awesome that I had to allow it.\n\n&gt;Clark begins breaking into the safe with his water bottle\n\n&gt;Shia is back\n\n&gt;Throck blocks front entrance and Jeb watches the roof hole with a pair of hedge clippers\n\n&gt;Shia jumps into roof hole and Jeb steps to the side\n\n&gt;Shia swings at Clark\n\n&gt;Clark panics and swings the water bottle\n\n&gt;Neither attack hits\n\n&gt;Jeb manages to stab Shia in the side with the hedge clippers\n\n&gt;Shia grabs the hedge clippers and throws them at Throck before fleeing out the roof hole\n\n&gt;With Shia gone Clark finishes working on the safe\n\n&gt;It's just money but they pocket some in case they survive this\n\n&gt;They head out and spot an access door to a crawl space under the bumper car pit\n\n&gt;They open it and decide to try to trap Shia in there\n\n&gt;They grab the extra weed whacker, turn it on, and throw it in the crawlspace\n\n&gt;Have Throck hide behind a car in the pit while the other two try to hide a little bit away\n\n&gt;The plan falls apart when they realize that Shia was waiting on the roof of the bumper pit\n\n&gt;Shia leaps down and manages to deal his first bit of damage\n\n&gt;Leaps at Clark, grabs him, tumbles to the ground, and takes a big bite from his left shoulder\n\n&gt;Clark punches Shia in the head\n\n&gt;It doesn't deal much damage but it gets Shia off of him\n\n&gt;Shia dashes off towards the ferris wheel with a chunk of flesh in his mouth\n\n&gt;Throck realizes the plan has failed and rejoins the others\n\n&gt;They decide to go to the office to press all the buttons\n\n&gt;Maybe one will be an alarm or something\n\n&gt;If not, everything will be on\n\n&gt;Clark actually decides to shout this plan out to Shia\n\n&gt;He thinks they can get a good blow in while they're there\n\n&gt;Shia dashes into the office and does them a favor\n\n&gt;He turns on every single ride\n\n&gt;They book it back towards the bumper pit and manage to lose Shia\n\n&gt;They head up towards the multi-legged ride thing\n\n&gt;Sneaking behind benches and dark patches\n\n&gt;They get in a small argument about where to go from here\n\n&gt;Throck wants to go to the game stalls but the other two want to head towards the fence with the intent of knocking Shia into it to shock him\n\n&gt;They decide to split up and turn to move\n\n&gt;Shia was standing silently behind them the whole time with the hedge clippers that he threw by the bumper pit\n\n&gt;Everyone scatters\n\n&gt;Throck toward the game stalls, Clark toward the fence, and Jeb toward the coaster\n\n&gt;Shia chases down Throck but misses his first attack\n\n&gt;Throck tries to retaliate with his billy club but the strike is deflected and he gets stabbed in the leg with the hedge clippers\n\n&gt;Throck's second strike connects with Shia's eye and he drops the clippers and flees back toward the concessions\n\n&gt;The clippers stay lodged in Throck's leg, merely twisting upward and digging into his leg\n\n&gt;He limps to the game stalls and uses fabric from the toys to make a tourniquet \n\n&gt;He hides amongst the toys\n\n&gt;The others hear Throck's screams and rush to find him\n\n&gt;It takes them a little bit but they eventually track him down under a giant stuffed animal\n\n&gt;They decide that at this point their best bet might be trying to get Shia onto the ferris wheel where they can push him off for massive damage\n\n&gt;They start moving toward the ride and have to cross an open space to get to it\n\n&gt;They enter the open space and immediately spot Shia on the roof of the ticket booth, pacing on all fours like a cat\n\n&gt;Shia spots them too and leaps off, chasing them\n\n&gt;They dash to the wheel, Throck lagging slightly behind\n\n&gt;The other two put Throck onto one of the the carriages before getting onto the next one themselves\n\n&gt;Clark thinks it would be a good idea to jump onto whatever carriage Shia gets onto to fight him\n\n&gt;Shia does not get on a carriage\n\n&gt;Shia climbs one of the support beams and jumps onto the roof of Throck's carriage\n\n&gt;Shia tries grabbing Throck from atop the carriage but gets a nasty blow to the hand instead\n\n&gt;Jeb still has the weed whacker at this point, but hasn't really used it\n\n&gt;Clark climbs on top of their carriage with the intent to jump to Throck's once he reaches the peak\n\n&gt;Shia jumps back two carriages, putting him behind Clark and Jeb's\n\n&gt;Clark trades his water bottle for Jeb's weed whacker and leaps after Shia\n\n&gt;Clark lands square on top of Shia, knocking him over\n\n&gt;He runs the weed whacker over the side of Shia's face, hurting him something fierce\n\n&gt;Shia manages to get up and jumps back to Throck's carriage, holding his wounds\n\n&gt;Clark manages to throw the weed whacker back to Jeb who manages to fail to throw back the salt water\n\n&gt;The bottle tumbles down and breaks open on the ground, splattering everywhere\n\n&gt;Jeb gets onto the roof, turns on his weed whacker and jumps after Shia, just as Clark did before\n\n&gt;Clark then attempts to jump from his carriage over to Throck's\n\n&gt;He makes the jump to the middle carriage fine, but his foot catches on Throck's and he falls and breaks his nose\n\n&gt;Clark spends a blood token to guarantee that he grabs Shia's ankle while the other two wind up attack\n\n&gt;Clark gets a swift kick in the head, but manages to hold on\n\n&gt;Shia ducks under the weed whacker and deals a nasty blow to Jeb's knee, but he doesn't manage to dodge the billy club\n\n&gt;The blow staggers him and he trips because of the grip on his ankle\n\n&gt;Shia tips off the side and is only being held up by Clark, who swiftly lets go\n\n&gt;Shia tumbles to the ground, striking his head on the ledge of the ride before righting himself and dashing toward the bumper pit\n\n&gt;They group gets back into the carriage and rides around the wheel once more clearing the cobwebs from their heads and planning their next step\n\n&gt;While they're going around part of the bumper pit explodes\n\n&gt;Shia tried to break the weed whacker under there and ended up igniting the fuel\n\n&gt;They see him run off to the office \n\n&gt;The shed is on fire something fierce\n\n&gt;Once they get off the wheel they run as best they can to the coaster to enact their latest plan\n\n&gt;The cars are cycling around, stopping for a little bit at the station before taking off again\n\n&gt;They get up to the boarding platform and prepare an ambush\n\n&gt;They shout insults and goad Shia into attacking\n\n\"Transformers 3 was terrible\"\n\n&gt;Clark intends to trip Shia as he runs up, Jeb will then hit him with the weed whacker, Throck will hit him with the billy club, and Clark will try to use Jeb's keys to gouge Shia's eyes, and once he's back on his feet, everyone pushes him into a car\n\n&gt;This does not work\n\n&gt;Every attack fails, Throck is left on death's door, Clark and Jeb are close behind\n\n&gt;Clark sacrifices his last bit of health body slamming Shia into the car right before it takes off\n\n&gt;Both Clark and Throck are on death's door and Jeb is nearly there\n\n&gt;Shia regains composure and starts moving again\n\n&gt;Clark decides that since he's probably going to die anyways that he would at least go out hurting Shia\n\n&gt;He stands next to the electrified fence\n\n&gt;Once Shia grabs onto him, he grabs the fence, electrocuting them both\n\n&gt;Shia is stunned for a bit, but once he regained his bearings he began eating the corpse\n\n&gt;Both Throck and Jeb head towards the burning shed\n\n&gt;Maybe, just maybe, they can get him that way\n\n&gt;Arriving at the shed they realize that the fence doesn't actually go around the shed, but stops right next to it\n\n&gt;The fire has burned a way out\n\n&gt;A dangerous burning way out, but a way out\n\n&gt;Throck knew he wouldn't survive going through the flames, but that Jeb could\n\n&gt;Jeb sacrifices his last bit of health ensuring that he gets through the flames and out of the park\n\n&gt;He's on death's door but he's out\n\n&gt;Throck distracts Shia with his corpse long enough that Jeb is long gone\n\n&gt;Jeb manages to get to a hospital and they treat him\n\n&gt;He may be amish, but he's insured\n\n&gt;The fancy TV in his hospital room says nothing about what happened at the park that night\n\n&gt;Once he's released from the hospital he finds the park\n\n&gt;None of the destruction or mayhem is evident anywhere\n\n&gt;Nobody will acknowledge his questions about that night\n\n&gt;He eventually goes back home\n\n&gt;He decides to stay amish and never leaves his community ever again\n\nSorry if it's not the best writing. I tried to do it all in one go while it was still fresh in my mind.  \nI have to say, it was some of the most fun I've had in a TTRPG ever, and none of the other three playing had ever played a TTRPG before.",

We decided to take a different approach to story telling and figured that it'd be interesting to tell our own Game Tales from the perspective of characters themselves. But one point we discovered that we could do so much more. So we expanded our horizons. A home for characters that had been retired, decommissioned, between campaigns, or just lost to time. A place where heroes that we once loved to play could have fresh life breathed into them. A place where heroes of old could meet up with soldiers of fortune from the future. A place where you share more than just a story. You can share drinks, fight battles, sing songs, trade items, and learn more about your character. \n\nSo we want to invite you all. Grab a seat, and order a drink. Spin a tale, and enjoy your time.\n\nCheers,\n\n/r/WayfarersPub",

        "text": "Some background: This is a game that I DM in which a group of 4 players take part in a homebrew setting filled with Pokemon. The dnd monsters are all pokemon and make up for the vast majority of pokemon available. However there are 'legendary' non-dnd pokemon, and these are the official pokemon that have been converted over into the system. These either pop up as part of quests, npc's might have them in their arsenal or part of fixed encounters. It's safe to say they don't pop up as often as the dnd variety.\n\nWith that out of the way...\n\nOur tale begins when the party of four are making their way to a nearby town to take part in their first tournament. This party consists of Grint, the dwarfen cleric; Professor Gareth Mapleson, a wizard; Avaaz, the teams bard and finally, Ultimate Trainer, a crazed half-orc barbarian who is the center of this particular tale. Together, they form Team Ultima! (They were having trouble coming up with a name, and the crazed orc suggested Team Ultima, and they reluctantly rolled with it).\n\nFollowing the road south towards the town, Team Ultima come across something odd; in the middle of the road is a small bag, and something is wiggling inside it.\n\nProf.Mapleson gets his pokemon, Hermes (blink dog), to have a look. As Hermes pads up to the bag, it opens. What they didn't see was a very thin string attached to the bag which was pulled by some unseen figures hiding out in the nearby bushes. \n\nAs the bag opens, out pops a Jigglypuff! And it starts singing... (I actually play the Jigglypuff song through teamspeak). The party have to make a saving throw to resist the effect, less they fall asleep. During all this, Ultimate Trainer is screaming \"Kill the pink devil, kill it!\" while the others are more interested in capturing this thing. Problem with Ultimate Trainer is that Ult really really hates Jigglypuffs. More fear actually than hate, cause of something that happened in his background. None of the other players are aware of this little detail, only the player who plays Ult and myself.\n\nUltimate Trainer fails his saving throw, and goes asleep. The others however manage to endure. But their trouble is only starting. The whole thing was a trap set by some local bandits who were using a stolen Jigglypuff to rob unsuspecting travelers. The bandits come out and demand that the party drop their weapons. Naturally, the party don't, and combat begins.\n\nTo summarize; the party win the ensuring duel. The Jigglypuff is currently unconscious but unharmed as a result of Grint's pseudodragon's sting. The party are quite delighted that they now have in their possession, a rare Jigglypuff, although they're currently unaware that the Jigglypuff is indeed actual property to a little girl in a town they're heading for.\n\nUnfortunately for them, Ultimate Trainer wakes up. As the party (particularly Grint) admire the curled up little cute pink ball of fur with the intention of nurturing it back to full health, Ultimate Trainer comes along carrying above his head a big massive rock. Before anyone could react to this sudden development (there was a failed roll to intercept Ult) the rock suddenly comes crashing down on the unconscious little Jigglypuff. SQUISH!\n\nBlood begins to ooze out from underneath the rock. The Jigglypuff is most definitely dead. Cue sad piano music playing over teamspeak while the party tension meter explodes and a fierce in-character debate begins to unfold. As for the players, there was some disappointment that their first 'real' non-dnd pokemon ended up getting murdered, but they did find it all very humorous if not slightly horrified.\n\nGrint says a prayer to his god on behalf of the dead Jigglypuff, and the party move on, albeit the tension is very high. In fact the tension was so bad between the characters that as a DM I felt that Ultimate Trainer would probably have a very hard time with the group, and a split could be on the horizon.\n\nThat night the party setup camp. Tension is still in the air, particularly with Grint and Ultimate Trainer. Grint's a cleric of Kesmeria (homebrew god) and needlessly killing a pokemon is something he can't abide. Each member of the party takes a turn to keep watch, and it's now Ult's turn. As the rest sleep, Ult notices something stirring up ahead, something moving... A big black bear comes stomping out, and Ult doesn't hesitate to engage the bear.\n\nUlt grapples with the bear, but neither gain advantage, however this is not a fight Ult can win on his own as the bear is much stronger than he is. The ensuring fight wakes up the rest of the party, and they all chip-in to help. Needless to say, its certainly a group effort as the bear is indeed strong and after a few rounds of battle, they whittle the bear down, with much effort on their part.\n\nOnce the bear is ripe for capture, Ult throws his pokeball at it, and captures himself a bear which he now names MachoBear Savage.\n\nThe fierce fight brings the group together and they do their signature victory pose; everyone does a performance roll and they achieve a remarkable pose. Most importantly of all, Grint is standing on Ult's shoulders at the end of the pose.\n\nThe tensions have certainly died down, and by the next morrow, there is no mention or talk concerning the dead Jigglypuff.\n\n... Until they come face-to-face to the little girl that lost her sweet Jigglypuff that she calls Miss's Snuggims.\n\n",

Its Warsaw.\n\nOur group goes through the underground tunnels, while hearing the bartender, who at this point pulled out a bottle of vodka\nand is just downing it, go off about mutant aligators, and vampires.\n\nCosmic: Vampires?\n\nBartender: What do you expect? Its Warsaw.\n\nPhilip: Hey I'm detecting something, and a whole lot of something on my radar.\n\nFelipe: Night vision activate.\n\nGuns: I thought it just activated by itself, considering you have robotic implants.\n\n[Outside the game]\n\nFelipe: Can I roll to tell Guns that it was really cool to say it out loud?\n\nDM: Charisma check, and I want 3, 5's\n\nFelipe: I only have two charisma\n\nDM: 2, 5's.\n\n2, he rolled a 2.\n\n[Inside the game]\n\nFelipe: I thought it would be rad to say it out loud!\n\nThe whole group nods in disapproval. Felipe continues to look around and he sees a outragous number of pale, white, people\n\n???: Bleh, you're sorrounded, bleh\n\nGuns: Everyone stand down, come into the light sir, let us see you.\n\n???: Bleh, I refuse, you'll have to come with us, bleh.\n\nPhilip: Fuck that.\n\nGuns: I'll give you a whethers original if you come with us\n\nPhilip: Okay.\n\nThey are escorted to a underground santuary, where it is revealed that the bartender is correct, there is a large community of \nSewer vampires, however the sewer vampires believe in a free market, that isn't nessessarily free to everyone, but is free-ish.\nThis annoys the bartender, and it causes the sewer vampires to look down at us, and how we are pretty much fascists in their eyes.\nThe first sewer vampire escorts the group to a giant building, almost like a cathedral.\n\nSewer Vampire: Bleh, Our king will decide what to do with you heathens, bleh.\n\nThe sewer vampire points at Philip Guy.\n\nSewer Vampire: Bleh, you're not allowed in.\n\nPhilip: Why not?\n\nSewer Vampire: You're in a giant robot and thats scaring the children.\n\nPhilip: Fair point.\n\nThe bartender also stays behind, and Felipe, Cosmic Saturn, and Guns Macintosh waltz right in.\n\nGuns: Alright, I have a plan\n\nFelipe: Shoot.\n\nGuns: He might do something bad to us because, look at us, we look like a couple of Jabronis\n\nSaturn: Jabroni?\n\nGuns: Remember, wrestling? However if we make ourselves seem like a big deal, he might let us slide.\n\nFelipe: How so?\n\nGuns: I'm a good impersonator, so how about I tell him that, I'm the leader of the Polish Fascist party.\n\nSaturn: Yes.\n\nFelipe: No.\n\nGuns: I can do a good goosestep.\n\nFelipe: And you think that could convince him?\n\nGuns: Yes, and if all things fail, you know what to do, you smite them you crazy spanish inquistior.\n\nFelipe: Thats a plan.\n\n\nThe Vampire king, is a meanacing figure, his size and figure is almost intimidating,\nhis throne room has 12 guards sorrunding a chair and a lightswitch that says \"Oh Nosferatu\" on it.\nhe sits upon a throne, with one bucket of hares to his side, he picks one up,\nsmiling at the young hare, looking at its adorable face, then he bites into its neck draining its blood and throwing it into\na bucket on the otherside that has \"Waste\" crudely written above it.\n\nV. King: Bleh, welcome to my lair, what are you humans doing venturing in my obode?\n\nGuns: Sir, I am Adolf Von Ludwig, leader of the Polish Fascist party, we uh...we uh are just trying to pass through\n\nV. King: I don't believe you, how about you explain to me what Fascism is.\n\nGuns goes on a tangent about the free market, because he does not know a single thing about Fascism, but he manages\nto impersonate a man who knows facism well because it appease the Vampire King.\n\nV. King: Okay bleh, I don't need you humans scaring my people. I can show you the way to leave if you help me do something\n\nGuns: Anything for a friend.\n\nV. King: Bleh, Friends. Not. The favor is, there is this other group of Vampires to the north and I need you to eradicate them\n\nGuns: How so?\n\nV. King: Bleh, we're a very progressive group of vampires but they've been killing my people cause they're traditionalist vampires,\nthey run around naked, and preach about social darwinism and how we should let the world do its own thing instead of existing because\nbesides humans, Vampires have also ruined the natural flow of the wor-\n\nGuns: I got it, and good thing for you my partner in the \"Giant robot\", hates people like that as much as you.\n\nV. King: Bleh, Okay, you should know where you're going when the sewers start to have graffiti of peace symbols, Bleh.\n\nGuns: Don't worry. Also can I grab that waste bucket?\n\nGuns grabs three heads of rabbits, and fashions a bunny head necklace while Cosmic grabs five bunny feet, much to the confusion of the Vampires\nand Felipe. They exit the Cathedreal and find Philip and The bartender sharing war stories.\n\nBartender: And that is how me and a few other friends, managed to pin down a dragon for the 1, 2, 3!\n\nPhilip: Hey you guys are back, how did it go?\n\nGuns: To spare you the details, we're gonna go north and kill a bunch of hippy vampires\n\nThe word hippy rattles in Philips head. You see, Philip has always had a hatred for Hippies, as well as a hatred for enviromental terrorists,\nthese but intertwine in his mind, and the anger in his eyes sends shivers down Guns spine.\n\nPhilip: Hippies? Where? I'll kill every single last one of them.\n\nGuns: Down here.\n\nGuns to prove to everyone that he is totally Adolf Von Ludwig, leader of the Fascist party of Poland, pulls off a really good Goosestep as he \nGoosesteps out of the lair. The group then continues their path up north and are soon once again sorrounded by vampires, but this time they are naked,\nand have deep red burning eyes.\n\nGuns: Bleh!\n\nGuns tries to communicate with the vampires to get to their leader and kill them all, but Philip's mind breaks, and his shoots a rocket straight at the Vampires\n\n**Combat is Initatied**\n\nGuns, confused swings his trusty Katana at one vampire, cutting it clean in half.\n\nPhilip opens a hole with one rocket and inside is a nest of these Vampires, He screams and blows up the nest.\n\n**Combat has ended**\n\nPhilip breaks a pipe that spews water, and breaks the whole sewage system for North poland. However this reveals a matinence tunnel for the group to escape.\nEventually they make it back to the Flogging Molly bar, and go around back and hide the walker.\n\nBartender: Fun adventure!\n\nGuns: That was horrifying\n\nBartender: Warsaw!\n\nThey enter the bar where a big group of Fascists cheer for the group, and they hoist them above their heads and take them to their phone.\n\nBartender: Hey, you guys.\n\nGroup: Yes?\n\nBartender: We may not look like much, I mean there is a guy dead on the floor over there, but what you guys did is much more better then working with the Indians or the \nPolish mafia. Consider this, the start of a new friendship, and if you guys need a favor, within reason, you can always find us here at the Flogging Molly.\n\nThe Bartender buys the group a round of drinks, and after a long and boring party which included the group breaking out the karaoke machine in the back of the bar to sing\n80s music, Guns finally sits down and dials his friend Johnson Johnson.\n\nJohnson: Hello this is Johnson Johnson, owner of the Johnson Job finding co. How can I help you?\n\nGuns: Hey John its Guns over here.\n\nJohnson: Hey Guns, how is your johnson Johnson?\n\nGuns: Johnson?\n\nJohnson: Johnson (But like in a cool way), alright Guns, what can I do ya for.\n\nGuns: So I'm sorta stuck in Warsaw, can you help me find a job?\n\nJohnson: Good for you, Aztec has some positions open for package delivery.\n\nGuns: Thanks Johnson, nice speaking to you.\n\nJohnson: Nice speaking to you to.\n\nPhilip: How do you know Johnson?\n\nGuns: Well, he was in the wrestling business with me when we were both young we won the Tag titles together, He moved on after we loss and won the world title, but due to a scandal\nwhich turned his life upside down, he started helping criminals..\n\nPhilip: Sorta like you\n\nGuns: Yeah but, I make it look cool. Alright gang, we have to head on over to Aztec corp, but lets make sure to get these Sharpie Swastikas off, or at least cover them.\n\n**To Be Continued**\n\nHey guys, sorry for the long delay in submitting. I have no idea whether or not we are continuing this campaign. However I'm writing two stories, a One-off called \"Return of the Rasta Punchers\" and a ongoing campaign called \"Adventures in Romania\".",

The party was thrown together hastily, with need and availability as driving factors in party creation.

[Wade](http://img4.mmo.mmo4arab.com/feature/kingdomunderfire2/gunslinger.jpg), a human brawler, would have been a paladin had he been raised in another environment. He simply wanted to take care of others and do the right thing. These adventurers quickly vanquished the goblins and dispersed the gathering horde of other monstrous humanoids by killing its leader. Overnight, they became heroes.\n\nThe party wandered from place to place, adventure to adventure. They stopped slavers from trapping Fey, forcibly restructured the leadership of the Tuckus Clan crime syndicate, saved the king from assassination on his deathbed, and redeemed a town from the clutches of an Efreeti summoned by an apprentice who didn't know what he was doing. They made various friends and contacts along the way. They met Atnas, a jolly dwarven bard, when they shared a campsite with him. Ari sang a bit while he fiddled, and the party looked forward to their meetings with him. They met Atriflyn, eternal elven Guardian of the North, whilst acting as escorts for a messenger. They stumbled upon the trapper Burrhis every now and then, who would yell at them for disturbing his traps set for various animals. Initially, the party was confused when they saw a carrot laying in the road, as bait for his rabbit trap. He soon grew to foxes, wolves, bears, and then owlbears. Jeremiah prayed that Burrhis would not trap something larger than he could handle. When solving the case of a serial killer, they met [Soren](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e3/e4/5b/e3e45b5ae095b17e595bc132570016d9.jpg), a masked half-orc sorcerer with an obsession with dragons and fire. Soren joined the party as an equal, though he couldn't understand why everyone kept referring to Vittle (clearly a normal adult halfling) as a rat. There were other figures, of course, like the poor single mother whom Wade financially supported, or the dwarven loggers and the dinosaur-riding druids, but that would be telling a different tale.\n\nThe strands of fate began to intertwine with an ill encounter with a band of ogres. A wounded girl in ragged clothes approached the party, saying that her sisters had been taken captive by ogres. The party naturally agreed to help her. The girl led them through some rough terrain and through a hilly region. Just when Jeremiah began to think that the terrain was a perfect plan for an ambush, ogres started pouring down the hillside. The girl revealed herself as a hag and joined her coven sisters. The party split their attention between the coven and the ogres, with Wade taking on the full brunt of the assault almost single-handedly. In-between arrow shots, Jeremiah cast a silence spell on Stringfellow and directed the falcon to fly above the hag coven to disrupt their casting. One of the hags grew to a monstrous height and snatched the bird from the sky, crushing it instantly. Wade finished off the ogres with crossbow assistance from Vittle, and the hags scattered. Though heavily injured, Jeremiah cast a fly spell on himself and flew after the hag which had slain his familiar. Seeing him separated from the rest of the party, the hag turned on Jeremiah and slew him. Soren had flown after Jeremiah and witnessed his death. Before the hag turned on him, he blurted out his willingness to switch sides, while telling his own familiar to warn the party, who had finished off one of the other hags, while the last escaped. The hag with Soren agreed to his deception and was baited into the ogre cave where it was slain after a tense battle with the rest of the party. There, the party did find three girls held captive, whom Wade immediately freed and started giving first aid. Of perhaps greater concern was a note which was addressed to any and all worshipers of Lamashtu, goddess of monstrous humanoids. She planned to establish her own rule in the North, where the adventurers called home. They tucked the note away and limped back to town with Jeremiah's body in tow.\n\nShortly before they reached town, they encountered the trapper Burrhis again, negotiating with a [woman dressed as an adventurer](http://jortagul.deviantart.com/art/Aelys-400116062). Behind her was a massive hill giant on a cart, tied up and unconscious. The woman was apologizing for slaying the man's owlbear, saying that she had brought him what he had been trying to catch. Burrhis accepted this, then declared that he now had everything he needed for his dragon trap before wandering off. The woman saw the party and introduced herself as Jill. She said that while she had taken down that hill giant herself, there were limits to what a solo adventurer could do. She asked if she could join the party, at least for some time. Immediately, the adventurers began to suspect that this was the hag which had escaped them earlier, come back to exact revenge and kill them in their sleep. This was seemingly confirmed when Vittle's magical crossbow determined that her alignment really was evil. Jill refuted this, saying that she was an orphan raised by full-blooded orcs, but a person's natural disposition wasn't deterministic of their actions. She took off all her magical gear, then said that if that wasn't enough, then she couldn't trust them. After confirming that Jill was not under any illusion or polymorph spells (and could not be the last hag), Soren removed his mask and revealed his tusked face. He said that he understood her point about not wanting to be judged by others. After a quick party council, the adventurers decided to accept Jill on a trial basis, watching their backs to make sure she wouldn't stick a knife in them. Not that she had knives, of course. Her only weapons were two saps, a weapon of nonviolence if there ever was one. The first night back in town, Soren observed Jill sneaking out of their inn to go to a thieves' den. Shen proceeded to incapacitate every thief, plant some very illegal poison in a desk drawer, then leave a note for the town guard. When Soren asked her about this, she said that she was just wrapping up some unfinished business. When he shared this with the rest of the party, they decided that while Jill may be evil, she was still the honorable type.The party let Jill accompany them and referred to her as their intern.\n\nWhen Jeremiah was raised from the dead, the party set out on more adventures with Jill. A dragon egg which they had been carrying hatched, much to Soren's delight. The party recovered a holy artifact of Irori from a temple which had been submerged under a river. Of some concern was a forest town which had been slaughtered down to the last man, which the party did not solve. The disturbing note from the ogre cave resulted in the great wizard Atriflyn calling a gathering of heroes from across the land to do battle with the armies of Lamashtu while she banished Lamashtu's herald from the land. At this gathering, the party discovered that Jill and Atnas knew each other, and that Atnas had looked after her for a brief time during her childhood. He vouched for her character, and the party's last remnants of unease were put to rest. The battle with Lamashtu's herald went off smoothly. Ari displayed her true worth of providing supernatural morale and courage to the entire gathering of heroes. Jill participated on an equal footing, and after this, her status as intern was a mere formality. Atriflyn promised each participant a hand-crafted reward of their choosing, which she would complete in the following months.\n\nA few months later, Vittle received a sending from Atriflyn, saying that their rewards were ready to be picked up. As the party made their way to her tower, they were ambushed by two summoners. They identified themselves as the last remnants of the Tuckus Clan. The summoners were defeated, but they identified Jill as the culprit behind the mass murder of their clan. The party had not parted on good terms with the clan, as they had tried to rob Wade, and so they were not actually upset by this accusation. Wade even joked that if she had done it, she would have done him a favor. The party still wanted an explanation though, so Jill told them a bit more of her past. She had been raised by orcs, but she had a biological younger sister who was also raised up with her. While Jill had been taught evil and come to live by it, her sister reveled in it and all of its cruelties and sufferings. Jill pleaded with the party to finish off the summoners, which the party readily agreed to do. They then proceeded onwards without a second thought about the matter.\n\nRumors began to spread of a lich who was creating an undead army in the mountains. The party seemed to always have more pressing issues to take care of, until they were surprised one night by a large group of Blast Shadows. The party began to track down rumors of this lich in town, while Jeremiah and his new roc familiar scouted the mountains for traces of where the blast shadows had come from. He managed to backtrack into the foothills of the mountains before he felt a magical pressure on his mind. Jeremiah shook off the influence and left to rejoin his compatriots. The party discovered in the capital that a lich could not be destroyed while its phylactery was still intact, which would be hidden far from the lich's current location. However, the party also heard that an artifact of life could be used to trace the path which a lich's spirit took to its phylactery when its body was destroyed. The only artifact of life which they knew of, the Branch of Life, was private property of a noble house. While scouting out the noble house, they saw a mysterious figure break in. They discovered that this was Wade's sister, who filled them in on the details of the situation. She was visiting a child of the noble house who was so physically ill that he could not leave the presence of the Branch of Life or he would begin to die. This was serendipitous, however, since the Branch could not tolerate anyone in its presence for long who was not holy and good, which few people were. Borrowing the Branch was out of the question, but the party conferred with the child and took him along with the Branch, under the cover of night. The child and Wade's sister traveled separately from the party on Jeremiah's roc familiar, while Jill and the party rode the waterways by boat, then later by foot. The group traveled this way until they reached the site where Jeremiah had felt the magical attack.\n\nThe group began a search for the lich's hideout and discovered a likely candidate in the form of a cave in the side of a mountain. They made their plan. Jeremiah would take the Branch of Life for safekeeping. The party and Jill would enter the cave, while the child and Wade's sister waited outside. The child assured them that he could survive a few hours without the Branch, though they vowed not to take this long. If the party found the lich, they would destroy him, use the Branch of Life to track down his spirit to his phylactery, and destroy him for good there. They prepared their equipment and spells, then entered the cave.\n\nAfter fighting a few cultists acting as guards, the party discovered that the entire cave had been set up with magical guards and wards, inhibiting their progress. Fog, spiderwebs, hidden doors, and disorienting intersections confounded them at every turn. Nevertheless, they battled through groups of undead and cultists as they cleared the dimly-lit dungeon. While interrogating one of the cultists, they learned that there was no lich... yet. However, the head necromancer was in the middle of his ceremony to become one. The group eventually made their way to a set of large mithral doors with loud chanting on the other side. The party buffed up, steeled themselves, then disintegrated the wall beside the doors and rushed in. \n\nThe found the necromancer with a horde of lackeys, and his top spellcasting devotees. The necromancer hit Jeremiah with a feeblemind spell which caused him to lose command of his divine magic, though he could still shoot his bow. Soren was trading with the spellcasters, though he was obviously outmatched due to numbers. Wade was taking care of the mundane lackeys, and Vittle and Ari were helping Soren against the spellcasters. Then Jill stepped forward and approached the necromancer. The party had seen how effective she could be in combat, and they held their breath in anticipation of if she would be able to take him down. \n\nInstead of fighting him, Jill dropped to one knee, reached into her pack, and presented the necromancer with the Branch of Life. The necromancer smiled and said, \"Finally, the last piece of my ritual.\" The party fell into despair, as they realized they had been played all along. The rumors of a lich had been started by Jill, as well as the method of tracking down the lich's spirit to defeat him permanently. She had been the one who had been responsible for the massacre of the one forest town as well as the Tuckus Clan. She wasn't raised by orcs. She had no sister. While she did spend some time with Atnas, it was only when she had just run away from home. She was and always had been dedicated to the necromancer, becoming his most trusted henchman. And now, she had hoodwinked the party into doing what she could never have done herself: deliver a pure, holy artifact which removed itself from the presence of evildoers, into the hands of a necromancer who would use it for his most unholy ritual.\n\nIt then fell upon the party to try to salvage the wrong that they had done. Vittle ran into the middle of a group of enemies and detonated himself, taking them out in a self-sacrifical blaze of glory. Jeremiah's feeble mind could not comprehend what was going on, but he kept firing at the enemy spellcasters. Ari was singing and using minor magic, until she was trapped behind a wall of stone. Soren managed to get a lucky fireball in which dealt serious damage to the necromancer and Jill. The necromancer grabbed Jill, waved his staff, and teleported away, leaving the party to deal with the remaining spellcasters. They managed, though not before the spellcasters had also dealt serious damage to Wade. In the end, a bloodied Wade, a drooling Jeremiah, a shell-shocked Ari, and a singed Soren were left standing over a room full of corpses. They did not relish the idea of going outside and seeing the convulsing body of the boy they had sworn to return the Branch to, or Wade's sister, who had displayed complete and utter trust in them. Nor were they keen on going back to the capital, where they were most assuredly wanted criminals for kidnapping and theft of a holy relic. They did, however, swear that if they ever crossed paths again, that would be the day to Kill Jill.",

        "text": "So, our party got ambushed by a group of orcs. Several are down and captured, but my Elf Rogue managed to get away. It also happened that we dinged 3rd level at the end of the session.  I decided to write up a little story for how he got his Arcane Trickster abilities.  I hope you enjoy. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRunning was the smart the thing to do. It really was; no matter how much it galled him to do it. That damn paladin started a fight we couldn’t possibly win, but once the avalanche has started it’s too late for the pebbles to vote.  Sean had managed to take out a few of the mounted combatants, but when the Paladin and that creepy girl went down in a hail of bullets he decided it was time to go. Just as he was making that decision the thrice damned Orc in charge shot him in the stomach.  There was no choice at all now. \n\nHe gasped out a quick order to the druid to run for it before he disappeared into the shadows. Praying to whatever gods might be listening that he could find somewhere to shelter in place until he could get the bleeding under control. \n\nRunning for all he was worth, sticking to the darkest shadows, Sean made his way deeper into the dilapidated neighborhood. Holding his stomach, praying that he wasn’t leaving a blood trail that even an Orc could follow, he splashed through puddles left by rain and gods knew what else.  Finally feeling that he had lost his pursuers, at least temporarily, he found a mostly intact dwelling to hunker down. \n\nAn hour later, washed sterilized, and pumped up on painkillers Sean was feeling much more Elven. He’d even managed to find a can of baked beans in a forgotten corner of the pantry he was huddled in.  They were cold, and a little spoiled, but you know what they say about beggars and choosing.  The house was also cold, and a little spoiled, but at least it was dark and quiet and hidden, or so he thought. \n\n“So, got yourself into a little trouble?” Came a voice from just on the other side of the pantry door. The voice was smooth, like a newly sharpened blade, and spoke in an old Elvish accent that Sean could not place.  There was no point in denying his presence or trying to fight his way clear. His tactical situation was abominable. He had counted on hearing his pursuers approach, Orcs are not known for their subtlety.\n\n“It would appear so, though nothing that I couldn’t handle, given time to rest and reconnoiter.”. \n\nThe voice laughed at this. It was a hearty laugh, and Sean could tell that it was used often. This man liked his humor, especially at other’s expense. “I like you. You’ve got style.  Sitting here eating your cold, moldy beans. Bleeding onto the linoleum, and you’re still cracking jokes.”. \n\nSean didn’t remember making any jokes, but didn’t see that it was the time to argue with the man.  Slowly, very slowly, he slid his short swords out of their sheaths and made ready to attack.  It was far from optimal, but options were limited, and time was his enemy. So far this voice was alone. Perhaps a scout, or a turncoat spy, such things happened though they were never spoken of. Either way, his best bet was to strike hard, and try to evade while the man bled out. \n“If you’re thinking of sticking me with those toothpicks of yours, I’d reconsider.  I’m here to give you something, and I’d hate to have to say I was wrong about you.  The last time I was wrong...No, wait. I’m never wrong.”\nSean blinked. Then resheathed his weapons.  It would appear that this man was more than he seemed.   His trainers always said “closed mouth, open ears”.  So he kept his mouth shut and waited to hear what this loquacious know-it-all had to say.\n\n“You have potential. Most elves do. Its why even the least of us know a spell or two.  But your potential has potential, if you follow. I’m going to give it a little nudge. There...you feel it? Eh, you’ll figure it out or you won’t... To make sure that you stay out of trouble. \n\nOh who am I kidding, I want you in trouble, but the **right** kind of trouble. \n*My* kind of trouble.  \n\nI’m leaving a friend behind. His name is Copernicus.  Use him. Listen to him. He’ll pass along messages if I feel talkative. Or if you cock something up. Which judging by your current humble location, is bound to happen.   Don’t let me down Sean. Or if you do, then do it in spectacular fashion.”\n\nSilence followed. Sean let 10 minutes pass before he eased the pantry door open and peeked outside.  Once he did he was greeted to a strange and unexpected site.  There was a gray horned owl sitting on the kitchen counter, waiting it would seem, for him.   Copernicus greeted him, it was an odd sensation. Not so much words, but the meaning was clear. They could communicate.\n\nWell, this changed the game a bit. Time to go and stage a daring rescue. \n\n ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/59hd90/ikrpg_hell_on_kephrea_chaos_above_chapter_25_the/",
        "text": "*Some background knowledge is useful at this point in the Hell on Kephrea; Chaos Above serial, and so all of this is given in a summary below of the legend of Carl’s Saviours (or, ‘the rise and fall of the IEC’, or, ‘the legend of Sigurd of Cragkeep’) as told by Sillith to the other adventurers at the end of Chapter 2. A proper telling would be as long as the entire HoKCA, so this quick summary is necessary:*\n\n\nOver the first two decades of the 38th century on Kephrea, two powers, the Ironclad Enlightenment Company (IEC), and the Hurm Empire, grew quite large. They became partnered, and by 3716, a man named Thomas Calvin ruled both. The IEC was an adventuring company which aimed to use new advances in technology to militarize the eradication of monsters, making the continent of Munida safe for everyone. The Hurm Empire started in a city-state in the North of a region called the Blue Coast, where many city-states had existed independently for millennia. It came to conquer and unite the last of these city-states in 3717.\n\n\nThe last city-state to be conquered was a mountainous fortress known as Cragkeep. By some miracle, the prince of the ruling family, a human named Sigurd, survived, although the rest of the family was saughtered. Sigurd became very good friends with a human warcaster named Rene “The Renegade”, who had come to Cragkeep the sole survivor of his small adventuring company, “The Renegades.” The Renegades had encountered a regiment of IEC troops, and for no discernable reason, the IEC slew the entire party. By some miracle, Rene stabilized by himself* some time after the IEC left, thinking him dead. He came to Cragkeep to escape the IEC, but arrived too late. In any case, they seemed uninterested in him. Sigurd taught Rene how to play a few card games, which he became extremely skilled at. For a few days, Rene was able to support the two with his gambling.\n\n\nSigurd encountered two members of his family’s regime, an elven spy named Danton, and the high priestess Mirash. Mirash was a peculiar woman indeed, it seems that she worshiped a mostly unknown god of fiery vengeance named K’Cam. K’Cam was so obscure, in fact, that the others initially believed she had completely made him up. These four banded together under Sigurd and form the Blue Coast Adventuring Company to make ends meet.\n\n\nThe first few missions of theirs were mostly uneventful, and can be summarized thusly: the Company acquired a strange artefact, and ended up pawning it off to some wizard at the Blue Coast University in Opulia. In fact, seemingly the only worthwhile event was that while running a dungeon, they met a totally incompetent necromancer named Carl, who they spared and dropped off at BCU, paying for his schooling. Proud of this action, the Company was renamed “Carl’s Saviours,” which is all well and good because they never technically incorporated as BCAC in the first place for pressing tax reasons. As a sidenote, Rene decided at this point that his horse was also named Carl, and from then on he cherished the horse closely.\n\n\nAfter leaving Opulia, Carl’s Saviours ran into Esmeralda, a drow, ex-lover of Rene’s. Over the next few days Esmeralda journeys with them, for the rest of her adventuring company had fallen to The Blight. Over the next few days, the meaning of her words was better understood, as the Saviours notice that she was blighted herself, and losing control rapidly. By the time they got to Bulue, they’ve had to bind her and tie her to a spare horse; Rene was determined that The Blight would one day be curable, and was unwilling to kill Esmeralda, even though he claimed to no longer have feelings for her. Obviously Esmeralda did not enter the city with them.\n\n\nNow, unbeknownst to Carl’s Saviours at this point, Thomas Calvin had written a whole treatise on why humans are the only real non-monsters, and Kephrea belongs to them and them alone. In Hurm, the slaying of non-human persons was decriminalized *(not wishing to get into the politics, I’ll just say this is a major cause of the weak government in Ormael over a decade later)*. In Bulue, a mysterious and outrageously handsome figure named [Caspar](https://www.theculturium.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/caspar-david-friedrich-wanderer-above-the-sea-of-fog-feature-the-culturium.jpg) was drumming up support for his army of adventurers and generally anyone who isn’t a human who planned to march on Hurm City to destroy the IEC.\n\n\nMirash was dragging the Saviours to a city called Ormand in order to climb Mount Ormandus and claim it for K’Cam or something, so Sigurd spoke to Caspar, explaining that they supported his cause, but were headed in the opposite direction. Sigurd and Danton together convinced Caspar of their competence, and Caspar charged them with destroying an IEC research facility atop Mount Ormandus of all places.\n\n\nCarl’s Saviours made it to Ormand quite quickly, but reports of the actual storming of the IEC compound vary. Some say Danton cleverly snuck them all in the back, others say Rene lead a small army of peasants from the town to bullrush the front gates, and there are those who say they all got themselves captured and escaped the jail within the compound to get to the center. A few things are sure: they made it to the site of a prototype bioweapon, a massive [Thrullg](http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/p/1006667/10877681/1313549237727/thrullg.jpg?asGalleryImage=true&amp;token=RPa6pYLy5kFngywIFjRWOVHlymI%3D) powered by some sort of Mundane generator. They encountered an elven paladin named Illisir who helped them slay this monster, and took Rene on as a squire, seeing promise in a young warcaster who takes great pains to spare his ex-lover. Mirash communicated with K’Cam, and became his Prophet, being granted a massive fiery sword called the Kiss of K’Cam. After the compound, Danton went to the local spy guild, and discovered that there had been a burn notice on him, since Hurm believed that the “real” Danton was killed in the capture of Cragkeep, and so this elf must be an imposter. Danton never was able to explain this oddity to the Saviours, but after what they’d all been through at the hands of Hurm, they accepted his story that he was the rea Danton happily.\n\n\nBetween Ormand and Valenti nothing really happened, more adventurey stuff. Valenti is just ouside of Hurm City, and was the location Caspar was gathering his troops to march on Hurm City. Carl’s Saviours made it there just a few days before the march, giving Caspar time to name Sigurd one of his captains. Sigurd and company would be joined by a human gunmage and dwarven field commander, both trusted dearly by Caspar, in penetrating the keep as a strike force on invasion day, and killing Calvin.\n\n\nThe day of the battle was very bloody. Mirash decided not to join the Saviours in storming the keep, and helped by creating fiery chaos on the battlefield. She burned to death in combat. Caspar, rather than stay behind and command his troops, ran into the fray personally, and was killed near the end of the day. Illisir and the dwarf both died before making it into the keep. It was Rene, Sigurd, Danton, and the gunmage who managed to enter the keep alive.\n\n\nIn the throneroom, the four discover that Calvin is actually none other than the ancient Paladin named Tyranny. The gunmage reveals himself to be the mythical figure named Feste, and has to flee the battle after greatly weakening Tyranny, due to serious injuries he had sustained.\n\n\nTyranny, a near godlike entity of evil, stood before Rene the Renegade, Danton the Lucky, and Prince Sigurd of Cragkeep. By some magic of Rene’s, or some trick Danton had kept up his sleeve his whole life, it is said that Danton appeared to multiply himself, and stood surrounding Tyranny, unloading round after round from his rifle into him. Tyranny managed to dodge every bullet, whether real or illusory, while fencing with the master duellist Sigurd near effortlessly. It was then that Rene saw Illisir’s ghost, and allowed it to possess him, gaining some fraction of a paladin’s powers. He channeled all of Illisir’s energy into a single blow, smiting Tyranny. Tyranny was weakened so greatly by this mortal strike, he staggered, and became riddled with Danton’s lead. Sigurd stabbed once, twice, three times into his heart. Tyranny’s last action was to blast each image of Danton with such dark energy that all dissipated, killing Danton. Finally, Tyranny melted into a black miasma, and was never seen again.\n\n\n*That is the story as recounted by Sillith, anyway. Again, accounts differ. Nobody spoke of Danton again, or of that nameless gunmage. Most people accept that Calvin was, indeed, Tyranny, who was, indeed, slain. Mirash probably died, but not long later another woman named Mirash became high priestess of Rosetti, goddess of romance, in that city. No worshipper of K’Cam has been heard from or spoken of after that day, save for the few Witches who still know his name (but that’s another story).*\n\n\n*So what happened after? The son of the old emperor was restored to the throne of Hurm. He granted the various city-states of the blue coast their freedom, claiming his father’s conquests were under the influence of Tyranny. Hurm City was renamed Caspar in honour of the man who lead the army which freed the land. Sigurd became the king of Cragkeep, and never adventured again. Rene was guided in a quest to become a paladin by the ghost of Illisir. After the battle, the great losses of many adventurers, particularly Caspar, caused despair among adventuring folk in the land, and a decade later, that despair had soaked into the culture of the entire Northern half of the continent. Some 11 years after the battle, a small port town called Conaghy was attacked by the Blight, but you knew that.*\n\n\n*So what was Sillith’s point? I return you to the grove where Sillith was telling this story at the end of chapter two.*\n\n\n***\n\n\n“So you see, that story had four adventurers killing a great evil, Tyranny. Danton, a spy, often hid his identity. Rene was a great friend to his mount, Carl. Sigurd was brave, and the only one to never use a supernatural power of some kind. Mirash was basically an agent of chaos, but K’Cam was sort of an evil god, and mislead her.”\n\n\nFurrio shook his head in disbelief. “But the four didn’t actually kill Tyranny together. Sure they were all there in the end, but the prophecy can’t have been about them. Plus, why would this prophecy appear so far Northwest of Cragkeep, a decade after all of this happened? That’s not how prophecies work.”\n\n\n“Ignoring your ridiculous misunderstanding of what happens when people write words on walls, there *were* four who fought Tyranny, maybe I just miscalculated. It’s just that Feste was the agent of chaos, not Mirash.”\n\n\nSillith and Furrio argued, and argued. Whether Furrio truly believed in the prophecy, or whether he was just trying to pick Sillith up after she lost Snowball is unknown. All that can be said is that Furrio never again mentioned the Emerald Watch, and the party all rode back to Conaghy together with Geldin.\n\n\nThey did not arrive at Conaghy in the manner in which they expected.\n\n***\n\n*Rene stabilizing by himself is very peculiar given the mechanics of Iron Kingdoms RPG. Normally this would be totally impossible.",

        "text": "Hello again! Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment or send me a \nprivate message. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThis is a continuation of '[Mutants and Masterminds] The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story part 13', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/57q983/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/.\nPreviously, our intrepid criminals evaded capture by Pinnacle's forces by hiding beneath the Hudson River. While they argued about their next move, Patterdemalion revealed that his brother was waiting for them in the New York City Fire Museum. \nPilot, now possessing the vampiric Lady Cold-heart, performed reconnaissance on the Resistance and discovered that they had already been destroyed. Realising that time was short, the team decided on a daring escape. \nArriving at the Fire Museum, they found Tatterdemalion and his captive prey: Angelus the Holy Avenger. This will be the finale of The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying. Strap yourselves in for a wild ride and please, keep your arms and legs inside the\nAngelus engine at all times.\n\nKitsune lounged across a beaten sofa, miraculously unharmed among the ravaged staff room. The rest of his team were scattered across the Museum or it's grounds; Patterdemalion assisting his brother with the ritual while Pilot went hunting for nourishment. Event Horizon was, predictably, on the prowl for coffee. This left Minato with the opportunity to simply kick back and relax for the first time in a long time. A cold can of soda in one hand and a cushion behind his head were once small luxuries but the recently deceased criminal felt like a king reclining on his throne. He was idly flicking through TV channels, listening to the panicked newsreaders trying to inform the world of it's doom. There was little no information, though Kitsune was surprised to learn that Australia had survived the assault mostly intact. He was wondering why before the broadcast was replaced with another.\n\n\"Greetings, my fellow survivors.\" Minato choked on a mouthful of bubbling drink as Pinnacle's chiselled face dominated the screen. \"I am Pinnacle. Many of you think me a criminal, a villain, and you would not be wrong. I have wronged society many times in my past, done abhorrent things, but I seek to rise beyond my past. The Zel'tan are a threat to the world as a whole and I will not stand by when our planet is threatened. I implore the governments of the world to stand beside me, to demonstrate the true power of humanity to these invaders. Together, we can drive the alien menace back and reclaim our home!\" Kitsune fumed silently, small trails of sticky liquid running down his hand from the crushed can. The medium lurched up from his seat and opened the door. Horrifying screams immediately echoed into the chamber from the foyer but he pushed on and headed outside. \n\n\"Pilot! Where the hell are you?\" He called out into the scattered debris. The only answer was silence before a layer of mist roiled towards him and coalesced into the vampire. Pilot wiped a smidgen of black ooze from her lip with a thumb, licking it off with a grimace. \n\n\"Those damn lizards taste like shit. What do you want?\" Minato shivered every time that Pilot spoke, unused to the innately seductive tone of his friend's new body. \n\n\"Remember how we couldn't figure out Pinnacle's master-stroke? He just sent out a broadcast asking the world to help him destroy the Zel'tan.\" Pilot hissed, her fangs popping into view for a moment. \n\n\"That would do it. He convinces them to ally with him then ingratiates he and his team with the government, makes them invaluable.\" The mercenary shrugged. Despite her demeanour, Pilot seemed almost impressed. \"It's a good plan. He must have been working towards this for years now.\" \n\n\"Question is: How do we fuck up his plans?\" Event Horizon asked from beside them, sipping nonchalantly from a paper cup. Neither Minato nor Pilot jumped, having grown accustomed to his high-speed entrances and exits. \n\n\"No-one would believe us if we revealed what was going on. We have no solid evidence and our credible sources were killed on national television.\" Kitsune leaned against the ruins of a wall and crossed his arms. \"If we pop up and start hitting his facilities then we'll have an army of clones chasing after us, even without the army of lizard-men. We need to cut the head from the serpent in one blow.\" Event Horizon snorted derisively, draining the dregs of his coffee. \n\n\"Pretty sure we tried that already, didn't we? Anyone else vaguely remember running the fuck away?\" Pilot levelled a glare at him, her eyes burning angrily. \n\n\"Raise your hand if you died up there.\" She and Minato threw a hand in the air while Event Horizon looked away sheepishly. \"Alright, so stop bitching about it.\" Pilot turned to Kitsune with an expectant look. \"What are you suggesting? You want to take another run at the bastard?\" The con-man chewed his lip contemplatively before finally nodding. \n\n\"Yeah, I think I do. If we don't take him out soon then we're going to have to deal with a Pinnacle that has the remaining world powers behind him. If you thought we were fucked now, imagine being on the run from literally everyone.\" He sighed and rubbed his eyes tiredly. \"It's not a good plan. Hell, it's not even really a damn plan and the chance of walking away is close to zero.\" He looked at his friends, an ember of determination burning brightly in his eyes. \"But I don't want him to win. I can't let that happen, not after how many friends we've lost.\" Minato spat on the ground. \"So that's that. I'm going to do whatever I can do bring Pinnacle down. I'm not asking you to come with me but I won't turn down the company.\" \n\n\"That was a lovely speech, my dear fox.\" Patterdemalion floated gently behind him, a toothy grin on his face. \"I concur with your analysis. Pinnacle has done too much to simply get away with it now. My brother and I shall assist you in this foolish endeavour.\" Minato nodded in thanks to the demon. He looked to his friends for their decision, a small smile on his lips.\n\n\"Pinnacle dies. No-one kills me and gets away with it.\" Pilot snarled, her eyes glowing vividly. The three of them turned to Event Horizon expectantly, watching as he groaned in resignation. \n\n\"This is literally a suicide mission. We are going to our deaths and whistling merrily about it.\" The speedster tossed his cup into a trash can. \"Do we have time for a quick stop-off? I'm not doing this without drinking enough coffee to replace my blood.\" Event Horizon asked cheekily, spinning his staff in lazy circles. The group shared a quiet chuckle before Patterdemalion requested their attention.\n\n\"I believe that my brother and I have finished with our transportation. If you will come this way, I will introduce you to the vessel of our revenge.\" With that, the demon flew slowly inside. His friends followed warily, uncertain they really wanted to meet whatever had made that screaming. Patters led them into the foyer, now lit up by scintillating runes that glowed with an infernal light. At the centre of this unholy light show sat a fire engine, or what had once been. Now the metal was marred and pitted with demonic sigils, chains of hell-fire wrapped around the surface. Small trails of molten magma dribbled from the headlights, small pools of scorching liquid burning into the tiles beneath. The truck shook visibly and a soft weeping could be heard from the engine. Tatterdemalion swaggered towards them, his tiny frame full of smugness.\n\n\"My friends! I humbly present to you my master-piece, the culmination of three thousand years of conflict: Angelus the fire engine!\" A keening wail followed his words as the angel screamed from her new prison. A coiling tendril of sickness rose from Minato's stomach, though he managed to quash it. Instead of expressing his disgust, Kitsune smiled politely.\n\n\"What a wonderful creation! May I ask as to the capabilities of this amazing device?\" Tatterdemalion preened beneath the praise while Patterdemalion rolled his eyes good-naturedly, fully aware of Minato's ways. \n\n\"The Angelus is capable of flight at super-sonic speeds while remaining completely undetected by any technological means, though I suspect a skilled sorcerer could still detect it. She is also impervious to mundane harm and powered by a volatile mixture of hellish and celestial energies.\" Tatterdemalion brought his hands together suddenly, the sound echoing through the museum. \"That means a big boom if we need one.\" Event Horizon laughed hysterically and wandered away from the horrific sight. \n\n\"Alright then. We have a vehicle so all we need now is to call up the heroes and find out where Pinnacle is.\" Pilot spoke up, staring at the possessed truck. Minato patted her on the shoulder, subtly admiring the strong yet supple muscle there until his hand was smacked away. Holding the wounded appendage to his chest, the con-man laughed.\n\n\"Any weaponry we can get our hands on wouldn't be remiss either. Besides, we know where Pinnacle is. He broadcast from that tacky stage on his secret island fuck-pad.\" Pilot scowled at him for a moment longer before rattling off a series of numbers. When Minato stared blankly in response, the vampire growled in aggravation.\n\n\"When I was still working with the mercenaries, I helped to set up a few safe houses across the United States. We filled them with vehicles, guns and enough ammunition to stock a Walmart.\" She walked away, long heeled boots clacking loudly against the shattered tiles. \"Those were the coordinates to one in New York. If I was a betting man, or horrible flesh-eating vampire, then I'd say that Pinnacle hasn't got a great guard on them. He did kill me, after all.\" Pilot called from the doorway before her flesh exploded from her bones, erupting into a chittering colony of bats. The howling cloud spiralled into the night sky and vanished from sight. Minato retched loudly behind her, his face green from revulsion.\n\n\"Did Pilot just turn into a flock of bats?\" Event Horizon asked indignantly. When Kitsune nodded weakly, the speedster spat angrily. \"Motherfucker, that's an awesome trick! Do you think my powers will get even cooler if I die?\" He chuckled to himself quietly, his faux-anger evaporating completely. Event Horizon waited until Minato had finished before speaking again. \"Am I the only one worried about him? Her? Fuck it, him.\" Kitsune wiped his hand across his mouth and then his hand across Event Horizon's costume, ignoring the disgusted cries. \n\n\"I don't think we've really got the time to be worried, if we're being honest.\" He shrugged helplessly. \"I'd suggest that he go see a therapist after all of this but I doubt any of us will survive.\"\n\n\"Hey, I might. I'm fast and stuff...\" Event Horizon protested halfheartedly. Minato gave him a small, tired smile. \n\n\"Maybe you're right. Either way, we need to wait for Pilot to get back and we have to contact the heroes.\" He wandered towards the demonic brothers with a question on his lips, leaving the speedster dejectedly kicking over some ceramic shards. A quick scrying ritual was performed, alerting the wayward superheroes to the plan. There was surprisingly little argument from the champions of justice; Minato assuming they had realised that a world with Pinnacle at the helm was worth dying to prevent. The valiant trio arrived half an hour later, followed shortly by Pilot. The former mercenary was dragging a decrepit truck by several heavy chains, laden with scattered weapons and boxes of ammunition. Deep gouges had been torn in the soil beneath incredibly thick rubber and unrelenting strength. Everyone inside was alerted first by the groaning of metal before Pilot slipped inside. \n\n\"Plus side, I'm stupidly strong now.\" She swaggered up to her compatriots, bearing a crate of assault weaponry. \"Choose your poison, boys and girls.\" A beam of mystical energy slammed into her, launching Pilot through a damaged exhibit. Steam rose from Doctor Paradox's gloved hand and an arcane glyph began to form behind his head, light pulsating from his form. Event Horizon zipped over, wrenching the sorcerer's arm down with an unbreakable grip. \n\n\"Enough with the lasers! That's Pilot. Pinnacle killed him, so Kitsune put his soul inside the hot vampire.\" Hero and villain glared at each other for a short time before Paradox shook his head incredulously, dispelling the magical power bubbling around him. Pilot emerged from the blemished display with a gurgling groan as her torso and face slowly began to regrow, the flesh knitting together with a wet smacking sound.\n\n\"Now that the introductions are out of the way, can we move on to business?\" Minato forced the group back on topic. There was a brief murmur of assent, with River Fox catching his eye. With a single look, the hydromancer expressed a myriad of emotions before settling for a contented pride. \n\n\"I knew you'd make a hell of a hero.\" The entire group chuckled quietly as Kitsune blushed beneath her praise. He tried in vain to gather his composure but the red streak across his face spoiled his facade. \n\n\"If we've embarrassed the lad for now, let's get this underway.\" The Scarlet Sentinel crossed her arms beneath her chest, a crimson blade held loosely in either fist. The ragtag team glanced at each other in silent acknowledgement as they came to a grim understanding: Pinnacle would die or they would. The Scarlet Sentinel nodded solemnly and began rooting through the scattered crates of weaponry. The others joined her wordlessly, preparing themselves for the last great battle they would ever face. The group shrank slowly as each of them climbed aboard the sentient fire engine until only Minato and River Fox remained. \n\n\"Any regrets?\" The heroine teased her long-time villain/flirting partner. Minato hummed consideringly before shrugging. \n\n\"Ask me after this is all over, maybe over dinner?\" River Fox tucked a stray strand of hair over one ear and smiled at the charismatic criminal-turned-resistance fighter. \n\n\"I'd like that.\" Her features hardened and the woman became the hero. \"Do we have a plan, beyond hit him really hard?\" Kitsune winced and shook his head. \"Alright then. Hit him really hard it is.\" The super-hero gripped Minato by his shirt and pulled him into a brief but intense kiss before pushing him away. \"Try not to die again.\" \n\n\"Right. I will try not to do that. Yes.\" The stunned villain clumsily boarded their transport with a goofy smile while River Fox vaulted into the front carriage. The Angelus screamed once more as Tatterdemalion began to direct the infernal energy through her mechanical form. The traumatic vessel rose off of the ground slowly, gouts of flame belching forth from the exhaust port. Waves of fiendish power rippled across the scarred body, pulsating faster and faster, until there was an ear-piercing shriek and blinding flash of light. The museum was once again empty, a shattered ruin of commemoration and history.\n\nHundreds of miles to the south-east, nestled between the strange electromagnetic fields of the Bermuda Triangle, Pinnacle prepared his forces for their debut. He would present his modified super-hero team to the world as saviours, with himself at the helm. His last broadcast had stirred hope in the neanderthals of Earth but they were slow to forget his previous, less than charitable deeds. They would need convincing and Pinnacle was the man to do so. His clone army, once modified to appear different from their source template, would serve as the enforcers in his new world order. All that remained now was to apprehend the small batch of malcontents who had decided against becoming wealthy and powerful. Pinnacle scoffed as he smoothed his mantle with a thought. \n\n\"Sentimental fools.\" He glared out to sea, standing at the centre of an open courtyard. One of his loyal soldiers appeared by his side, whispering into his ear. \"Very good. Thank you, Reginald. I will take the stage in a moment.\" His minion nodded and turned to leave before exploding into ash. Pinnacle scowled with displeasure, preventing any of the fall-out from touching him with a shimmering shield. Beams of intense heat rained down around him, immolating his henchman and turning much of the courtyard to molten slag. The would-be dictator fixed his gaze to the sky, preternaturally keen vision locked on the flaming truck soaring towards his island. He thumbed a hand over his ear to activate the communications device there. \"Summon my team to Courtyard Alpha. Our prey has arrived.\" \n\n\"Did we get him!?\" High above, Event Horizon roared to make himself heard over the bellowing hell-cannons. He could not make out Tatterdemalion's answer but saw the frustrated look on the demon's face. \"I guess not. Keep shooting?\" Whether the imp heard him or not, the diabolical weaponry fired again and again. Patterdemalion and Doctor Paradox sat side by side, using their mystical skill to deflect any return fire. Explosions tore through the sky around them, rocking the Angelus but causing no real harm. Event Horizon glanced at the meditating form of River Fox and prayed that she was ready. They rocketed towards the island fortress, Pilot guiding the Angelus to weave between a barrage of anti-aircraft rounds. They skimmed the sea violently, sending up waves in their wake.\n\n\"Here we go. Shields to maximum!\" River Fox snarled, her voice reverberating through the cabin. Her eyes snapped open and wisps of cerulean energy leaked forth. The ocean stilled for a moment before surging into motion. The sea became a living, wrathful entity at her command; Colossal waves battered the facility, sweeping away soldiers and crushing machinery beneath the immense volume of water. Patterdemalion strained and Doctor Paradox groaned at the effort of protecting their vessel from the immense weight of a tsunami, though they managed to persevere. Between the repeated thermal assault and a furious ocean pounding at their doors, the fortress had little choice in the matter: With a terrible screeching of metal, the exterior defences buckled and crumbled. The Angelus' crew seized their opportunity and rocketed inside. Their triumphant entrance was undone when the truck came to a sudden, jarring stop. \n\n\"Of all the villains in all the world, why did I end up with the idiots?\" Pinnacle snarked at his foes, suspending their transport in mid-air with his power. \"Thank you for saving me the trouble of tracking you down. I was hoping to avoid a drawn out pursuit.\" He likely would have monologued at them for longer had the hell-cannons not opened fire point blank. The Angelus hit the ground hard but intact and it's passengers exploded forth with a wordless battle cry. They were met mid-charge by Pinnacle's team and bloody conflict unfolded. \n\nBlurs of motion streaked across the battlefield as two or more speedsters tried to slaughter each other. A bestial clone of Stonewall tore at the gelatinous mass of Tatterdemalion but his powerful blows were rendered useless by the gibbering heap. Lionheart danced between the assault of the Scarlet Sentinel, his magical shield barely withstanding her frenzied assault. Doctor Paradox engaged Bloodstone once again in a scintillating display of magic, the mighty sorcerer prepared to give his life to snuff out his nemesis. River Fox brought up waves of twisting water to absorb the electrical onslaught of Boogaloo, the energetic being unable to harm it's prey. Through it all, Patterdemalion contended with the telekinetic might of Pinnacle himself. The air trembled and small craters formed as psychokinetic energy rent the earth asunder. Patters knew he would never be able to defeat Pinnacle with his power alone. \n\n\"You should have stayed in Hell, you pathetic whelp. It would have saved you the journey home.\" Pinnacle hissed at his demonic foe, advancing on the winged being. His march stopped abruptly as a rocket slammed into the ground at his feet, throwing him through the air. Pinnacle rolled to his feet with as much grace as he could muster, unharmed save for his pride, and found himself face to face with a smirking Kitsune.\n\n\"Hi there.\" Minato wrapped the villain in a tight embrace and ignited his ghostly flames. The spectral fire burned at Pinnacle's very soul and the tyrant screamed in agony for the first time in a long time. A wave of force ripped from his suffering body, scattering earth with it's force; Minato turned into a fine mist of pink and red. His spirit threw up it's translucent hands in frustration. \"Oh come on! I just got that body.\" His irritation turned to panic quickly as his phantom began to fade away. \"What the hell? This took like ten minutes last time!\" Kitsune spun frantically, trying to decide on an appropriate host even while as strength abandoned him. A wicked idea entered his mind, watching Pinnacle toss Patters around like a sack of potatoes. He gathered his ghostly might and hurtled towards Pinnacle.\n\nThe conqueror hissed as he felt something try to possess him, shrugging off the attempt effortlessly. One hand raked out like a claw, shredding Patters' wings from his body. The imp gave a choked cry and hit the ground in a flailing mass of tiny limbs. As his foe advanced, Patterdemalion looked out across the pandemonium: The Scarlet Sentinel lay dead, her throat sliced with deadly precision, and Lionheart staggered towards an exhausted but triumphant Doctor Paradox. His brother had begun to succumb to Stonewall's clone, the unyielding mountain of a man striking his foe again and again, while Pilot tried to distract him. River Fox had dissipated the lightning form of Boogaloo by locking it in a whirling cage of water and Event Horizon dropped one his inferior duplicates with a skull-shattering blow. Mercenaries were flooding the courtyard now, accompanied by hulking Zel'tan shock troops. The battle would not end in the rebellion's favour. \n\n\"Brother. It is time.\" His mental command echoed through Tatterdemalion's mind and the shape-shifter dropped beneath a potentially lethal blow, a tiny ferret scurrying away from the conflict. Pinnacle summoned his diminutive foe to him with a thought and grasped Patterdemalion by the throat, savouring the sensation. \"Flee, my friend. We will finish this.\" Event Horizon jerked back, confused at the presence of a foreign voice in his head. He swivelled in place, narrowly avoiding a speeding clone. His eyes met Patterdemalion's across the battlefield and the demon smiled. \"Run.\" Pinnacle roared in triumph and flexed his superhuman muscles, tearing the imp's head from his body. Event Horizon hissed and sped past the massacre, snatching River Fox from her attempt to save Doctor Paradox. The speedster held her tightly to him to avoid whiplash and zipped away from the fortress, his density control keeping them over the ocean. \n\n\"How embarrassing for you.\" Pinnacle followed the sound and his eyes widened: Tatterdemalion held a crackling crimson orb in one hand and the open grill of the Angelus Truck in the other, a violently shuddering mass of energy inside. \"All those years of careful planning and preparation foiled by some idiots with a grudge.\" The twinless twin laughed maniacally and rolled the sphere like a bowling ball. It melded gently with the amorphous power and time seemed to stop. \n\nPinnacle screamed silently in seething disbelief as silence fell over the devastated fortress before a deafening explosion howled into existence, fuelled by an unholy abomination of divine and cthonic energy. A perfect sphere of liquid destruction expanded out from the truck, disintegrating everything that it touched. It grew and grew until it began to devour the very ocean itself. The surviving speedster clone was consumed by the ravenous globe and Event Horizon could feel the hungry presence at his back. All he could do was keep running, his legs desperately pumping. The spheroid hunted the across the ocean, unmaking everything behind them until even light began to wither and die. Still, Event Horizon ran. It was, at the end of the day, what he was best at.\n\nWeeks later, the Government's of Earth were still recovering from the Invasion. Pinnacle had succeeded, though not how he had hoped; Unconditional support went out to anyone in need and there was a peace brought about by shared suffering. An organisation was created to monitor and prevent threats of such magnitude from every happening again, with River Fox at the helm. The only surviving member of the Resistance had set the record straight about the Zel'tan, the Invasion and Pinnacle himself. She led raids across the world, destroying his laboratories and euthanizing the clones they had produced. Pinnacle's mercenary forces and his collaborators were tried before the Hague, where they were sentenced to life in prison without a chance of parole. Those who had lost their lives against Pinnacle, whether they were hero or villain, were honoured by the Department of Superhuman Affairs. It had been a time of great horror for humanity but it had led to a golden age of peace.\n\nEvery year that passed, one of River Fox's accountants would come to her regarding a discrepancy in the department budget: There was an annual payment being made to a small dance studio in New York City. It would have gone unnoticed, given that it was a comparatively tiny portion of their enormous funding. And every year that passed, River Fox would smile slyly and answer the same way.\n\n\"Let's keep that between us. After all, what harm could a dance instructor do?\" ",

        "text": "\"I've done it! By God, I've finally ***done it!!!***\" came the exuberant cry from Blue's workshop.\n\n\"Done what, sir?\" Came Sergei's startled reply as his master barged into the main room of Red Rocket Station. Master Blue had come home all of a sudden after 3 straight days of scavving, then shut himself in the workshop for another week. So Sergei was a little alarmed at Blue's sudden exclamation, and that alarm only heightened when he saw Blue rushing at him holding an incredibly deadly-looking rifle of some sort. He had to resist the urge to activate his defense subroutines.\n\n\"This, Sergei, *this!*\" Blue explained, waving the rifle in the air excitedly. \"This is, without a doubt, the single greatest weapon I've ever had the privilege to build.\" Activating his scanner, Sergei noticed parts scrapped together from several other weapons, all cobbled together to create a truly impressive piece of weaponry; automatic barrel, beta wave tuner to set things on fire, sturdy stock, short-range scope, probably meant to keep distractions in his peripheral vision. and a beam-splitting barrel.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I see it, but what does it *do*? Sergei asked.\n\n\"Let's go outside and I'll show you,\" Blue said, a slightly manic grin on his face.\n\nFive minutes and one hastily set up test-dummy later, Blue was outside with Piper, Sergei, Cait, Codsworth, Ada, and Curie standing by just in case someone got hurt. Sergei took a look at the target Blue had asked Codsworth to set up while he rounded everyone up. It was a ramshackle thing, just some sticks tied together with spare junk wires and decorated with old leather clothing and a broken powered-armor helmet. Sergei almost felt a little sorry for it.\n\n\"Okay, I'm ready!\" announced Blue. \"Everyone, kindly step away from the dummy. The test-fire will officially begin!\" Everyone hastily backpedaled away from the training dummy like it was a Glowing One as Blue took aim.\n\n\"Firing in three...two...one...*FIRE!!!*\"\n\nThe ensuing cacophony of lights and sounds was so furious that someone looking on from afar would be forgiven for assuming some fireworks had gone off. Clusters of red light shot out from the barrel of Blue's rifle, knocking the barrel upward with each shot until he was eventually blasting holes in the roof. When the noise had subsided, Blue surveyed the damage. The training dummy had been all but completely obliterated, burning holes left in the chestpiece, the power helmet lay shattered a few feet off to the right.\n\n\"Well, that was...certainly a learning experience,\" said Blue as Cait helped him up. \"Anyone hurt?\" he asked, looking around. When everyone affirmed they were fine, he turned around and headed back to the workshop, muttering to himself. \"...maybe loosen up the pistons on the recoil dampeners in the stock, decrease the output of the lasers...\"\n\nSergei just shook his head and muttered to himself as he set about his patrol.",

One player stood up and offered to run Dark Heresy while we're on the hiatus.\n\n---\n\nThe party consists of: Feral-world Guardsman (yours truly), Shrine-world Adeptus Mechanicus and a Voidborn Psyker. Technically speaking, we're not in service to an Inquisitor (yet), but in service to the planetary police force - it's a Hiveworld. Lots of people. We've been tasked with finding the source of a certain new drug which utterly fucks you up.\n\nWe knew where you can buy it. _Buying it_ was the difficult part. The second one of us tries to get in is the second the dealers disappear. We are obviously cops.\n\nSo we go track down Benny, a local junkie, dealer and general sleazebag. One of the other party members dealt with him before. We track him down and try to get him into our service. He doesn't really want to. I offer a trade - favor for a favor. Perfect! Benny needs a ton of cash. He loaned some money and the loan shark's going to break his legs... soon.\n\nWe can do it. Just get rid of the loan shark.\n\nWell, the Psyker went in to scout. It was a small fortress - direct assault was deemed suicidal. Getting (counterfeit) money from our superiors would take forever and we weren't in the mood of owing a service to anyone in the station. So we went to Benny's flat.\n\nWe haven't solved his problem.\n\nHe wasn't delighted.\n\nHe didn't want to let us in.\n\nSomeone tried to intimidate him into letting us in... failing spectacularly. I, on the other hand, had different ideas.\n\nI took a frag grenade and a piece of duct tape, showed it to Benny, grinning like a maniac I am, and said \"I'm going in one way or the other.\" Benny was terrified: \"You're crazy!\"\n\nNow comes the title - \"I've seen him do crazier things, Benny.\"\n\nBenny reluctantly let us in. There was some scuffling, but nothing really important (Benny tried to escape). We waited until the thugs banged at the door. Cue full-auto autogun and semi-auto lasgun at the door.\n\nThe two thugs never stood a chance. \n\nWe quickly looted them and went on, now forcing Benny to work with us - or he _will_ lay dead at the loan shark's feet.",

        "text": "Link to previous \"adventure\" :https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/58e0j7/the_green_dangler/\n\n\nThis segment of the Dangler's adventure takes place a bit after the events of the first, and this portion of the tale is going to have some extra emphasis on our celebrity bard who is name Tem Cruz btw.  At this point, the group has found the location of the BBG's hideout, an underground facility producing drugs that cause those who ingest it to rapidly morph into  a monstrous humanoid controlled by frequencies.  \n\n\nAfter preparation the group heads out to the shore of an ocean on the western coast of the continent where there information for the hideout's location pointed to.  A bit of time searching passes and the group finds an \"entrance\" into the facility through an underwater tunnel serving as a water pump for the underground facility.  Upon entering the tunnel, the group swims through it having to destroy an underwater spinning fan in order to proceed.  Shortly after they discover a grate leading into the facility into a control room for the pumps.  Above the grating they see two individuals walking above approaching the grating, likely coming to repair whatever is causing the pump malfunction (the damaged fan).  Luckily for the group, the tunnel is dark and the room above is lit so the approaching people do not seem to notice them approaching.  As soon as the individuals removed the grating, the team went for a surprise attack.  First, the sacred huntmaster's lioness, named Momma Kitty Love, leaps from the water biting into the human man above and pulling him into the water, followed by the oread zen archer popping up and firing an arrow through the skull of the human woman accompanying him.  Gotta be care of them water lions of course.  \n\n\nNow we were all drinking a bit at this point so as a DM I was feeling a little immature.  Upon looting the bodies and examining the room, the group found, among some other mundane items, a locket on the woman with a picture of her, the man, and a little girl who was determined to be their daughter.  YAY ORPHANS!!!  The group feeling a little guilty, decides to trudge on up a ladder to a hatch.  Upon opening it, there is a another man above facing the other direction.  They pull this man through the hatch and dispatch of him quickly.  The man was wearing an officer's uniform so Tem uses his hat of disguise to dawn an officer uniform, albeit smaller since he is a halfling.  Crowthorn, the Dangler, and Momma Kitty Love are made to be invisible, and the Huntmaster disguises himself as the now deceased mom. \n\n\nNow that all disguises and preparations are ready the team heads above and are at the intersection of a \"T\" of hallways.  Choosing to go the the right, after getting about halfway down the hall, a little girl walks around the corner (I'm so evil).  \"Mommy!\" the little girl yells and begins running towards the group, only to be stopped by another man in an officer's uniform grabbing her by the arm and yelling at her to return to the barracks.  The little girl refuses and keeps trying to go to her \"mommy\" saying that she doesn't like living here and just wants to go home while pulling against the man.  The huntmaster, not being able to disguise his voice remains silent as the little girl watches confused pleading for help as her mom stands there doing nothing, saying nothing.  Now Tem, being most proficient in perform (actor), is diligent in staying in character as an officer for the BBG.  He approaches the little girl, standing roughly the same hight as the child, and slaps her across the face and orders her to go back to the barracks or face the threat of punishment for her parents.  The girl, stunned, retreats back to her room with tears in her eyes.  The other officer laughs and tells Tem good work, and then goes on his way. Tem Is obviously very lovable.\n\n\nFrom here, the group splits up to collect clues, and gather information from their fellow \"comrades\" in the facility.  During this time, Tem stumbles upon a section of the facility with a bunch of engines and similar machinery.  Tem then decides that it is time for him to be a good little worker and make sure the crew is working at maximum efficiency.  He approaches the engineers and commands them to increase the power of the machines and proclaims that they are not working nearly hard enough.  The engineers nervously turn up the power slightly causing the room to grow a little warmer.  This does not satisfy Tem.  He commands them to reach maximum power or face punishment.  The engineers tell him he doesn't know what he is talking about and refuse.  Tem, a dutiful minion that doesn't take shit from those working below him, then stabs the nearest one with his dagger and then immediately heals him,  but not to full hp.  The workers now stricken with fear nervously increase the power to maximum causing all kinds of gauges to fall into red zones and the heat of the room to skyrocket.  The engineers plead with Tem to let them stop, but he refuses.  The engineers begin running from the room as an alarm begins blaring, signaling Tem to dimension door back down into the pump room.  He does this just in time as the entire engineering wing explodes and collapses half of the top floor of the facility.  \n\n\nIn the chaos, the group slips past the guards into a lower level of the facility requiring higher clearance.  More of the story is to come, but this is where I will end for now.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Background: I'm a new DM, running a game for people who are themselves almost entirely new. I think each of the players has played 1 or 2 sessions of D&amp;D in the past. I've played around 10 sessions, plus I've watched a lot of D&amp;D games on YouTube, particularly Acquisitions Incorporated. We're running LMOP, the starter adventure, but with some alterations.\n\nNormally, we have a 3-person party, the Rogue (CN), the Warlock (CN), and the Paladin (NG). This week, though, the Warlock was busy and another friend wanted to join the party, so he joined as the default Cleric (NG) from the Starter Adventure, so the party was:\n\n* Rogue (Chaotic Neutral)\n* Paladin (Neutral Good)\n* Cleric (Neutral Good)\n\n---\n\nLong story short, the party was supposed to retrieve a shipment of stolen drugs for the innkeeper, Toblen Stonehill. A shipment of opium was coming down the Triboar Trail, but it never made it to Phandalin. A group of human raiders had attacked the caravan, left no survivors, and stolen all of the drugs. If the party can return the drugs, the innkeep will help them with (an election for mayor that's going on in Phandalin.) The innkeep points out the rough area of the trail where the caravan was last seen, and the party hurries off.\n\nAfter 6 hours of walking, they find the approximate area where the caravan was last seen. They see no wagon wheel tracks, but they do find a small, worn path heading off to the north of the trail, into the woods. They sneak along either side of the trail, the two heavily-armored, unstealthy Paladin and Cleric to the east of the path, and the Rogue to the west. The Rogue sees in the distance a small clearing, and smells smoke, so he sneaks forward and investigates. He rolls kind of eh, so he makes out a burning campfire surrounded by 3 tents, with some crates at the edge of camp, but he can't tell where anyone is.\n\n**Assuming that the crates indicate these are the guys they're looking for,** he goes back and tells the other two to advance. He comes up along the west side of the path, while they come up along the east side. What neither the Rogue, nor the Paladin or Cleric saw, was a scout sitting down taking a shit, right where the Paladin and Cleric are walking to sneak up on the camp. They both roll badly on their Stealth checks, and run smack into him. He stands up, but I give them 1 round to do something about it.\n\nThe Paladin decides he's going to try to knock the guy unconscious by smacking him with the flat of his blade, but he bungles his roll and ends up smashing the scout's nose in, causing the scout to scream out in pain. The Cleric panics and tries to 'knock the scout unconscious' with his warhammer. He also messes up his roll badly, and instead smashes the scout in the chest for a lot of damage, to which the scout says, \"What the fuck!?\"\n\nIt's at this point that the party stops to think, **\"Wait a minute, what if these guys *aren't* the guys we're looking for?\"** but all the noise the scout has made has alerted the 2 other guys in the camp, who jump out of their tents, and initiative is rolled.\n\nThey hack and slash at 2 of the 3 guys, killing the scout and 1 of the guys who were in the tents. The entire time, these guys are yelling, \"What the fuck is going on?\" as, from their perspective, they're getting slaughtered by a group of raiders who snuck up on them from the forest. The party interprets this as yet more evidence that these aren't the guys they're looking for, and they're laughing and kind of freaking out, but it's too late to stop now that they've started slaughtering these guys. \n\nThe Rogue sneaks up behind the last guy, puts a knife to his throat, and tells him to surrender. He does, and the Paladin intimidates him into telling them what he's doing. He says that he and his 2 friends had stolen some crates of armor from a merchant in Phandalin, and were planning to sell it in the next town over. The Paladin asks if he or his friends had killed anyone in stealing the armor (hoping, no doubt, that there might be justification for the party having just killed 2 people in cold blood). Unfortunately, the thief says that they had broken into the merchant's business in the middle of the night, hurting nobody. \n\nThe party knock him unconscious, and then they have a moral dilemma on their hands. These thieves, while surely deserving of punishment, did not deserve to be spontaneously *murdered*. The surviving thief also doesn't deserve to die, but on the other hand, he might go back to Phandalin and tell the whole town that the \"Heroes of Phandalin\" had just murdered 2 of his friends in cold blood. The Rogue, as Chaotic Neutral, is more than willing to kill the thief to ensure he doesn't spill the beans, but the Paladin and Cleric both feel that they cannot in good conscience kill a man who does not deserve death.\n\nThe players argue OOC for a while, and then the Rogue tells the Paladin and Cleric to bury the other 2 dead thieves since they didn't deserve to die, so they \"at least deserve a proper burial.\" While they're doing that, he goes over to the unconscious thief and cuts his tongue out. He rolls well, and manages to staunch the bleeding. He goes back over to the Paladin and Cleric, at which point the Cleric (who knows OOC what the Rogue has done, but not IC) says, \"Oh yeah, once that guy wakes up we'll have to confirm with him that he won't tell anyone what happened here.\"\n\nThe Rogue then makes up several excuses for why only he needs to go back and confirm with the guy once he wakes up, while the Paladin and Cleric can go load up the shipment of stolen armor onto a cart to take with them and return to the merchant in Phandalin. The Rogue goes back to the thief, wakes him up, half-chokes the guy pouring a potion of healing down his throat (which the Rogue himself notes will restore the thief's health but doesn't restore his tongue), and then drops a pouch of 100 gold in his lap, telling him to not speak of this day to anyone, or he'll kill him. The party return to the Triboar Trail and eventually find another path leading off into the woods, which this time *is* the right path to the raiders.\n\n---\n\nThe best part of all of this is that I as the DM *didn't plan for this to be the wrong group of guys*; originally it *was* going to be the raiders. When the Cleric and Paladin started smacking down a surprised scout, though, I had the scout yell out, \"What the fuck\", thinking it was a natural reaction to taking a shit and then suddenly getting attacked. They interpreted it as meaning this guy might be innocent and not have any reason to be attacked by them, which I went along with. I even had them roll a d20 when they opened up the crates (behind the scenes to determine if the camp they had attacked were innocent thieves or if they were the raiders). They rolled a natural 1, so the group really were innocent thieves.\n\nEverybody was laughing pretty much the entire time this whole thing is going on, as they all realized they fucked up. The Cleric's player also pointed out that his character had joined the party to do good in the world, and the very first thing they did together was accidentally murder 2 people. Whoops.",

        "text": "[The Witch Is Dead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/58ala1/the_witch_is_dead_is_a_free_onepage_game_about/) Killed in her own home by a witch hunter. Her animals, familiars really, gather around her, each mourning in their own way. This wasn't fair. It wasn't *right*. Something has to be done- and someone has to *pay*. And perhaps there's a way to do both. If the animals can bring the eyes of the murderer to the witch's body, perhaps she could come back... maybe. If not, then they'd torn out a complete bastard's eyes, so no real loss there.\n\nJasper the black cat was only marginally invested in the quest for revenge, as people weren't so much *individuals* and more *dispensers of food*. But the witch had been very good at making fish, so perhaps he would deign to be dragged along... and besides, he might finally make use of his open-and-close spell.  \nFidget and Gidget, the twin owls, were in an uproar about this. This was injustice. Fidget, with the power of dinner, would keep everyone's spirits up and provide advice, while Gidget, a bit more fussy, would be more hands-on and use her power of Mage Hand to help out in a jam. Plus, they could fly, which was nice.  \nBjorn, the dog, was already foaming at the mouth about how he was going to tear the witch hunter to shreds. And with his power of tearing people to shreds with his teeth because he was a goddamned dog, he was already pretty much halfway to doing it. He also thought he knew a spell, but he probably forgot it.\n\nThe three of them set off for the village that the cowardly witch hunter had hidden himself in, following the scent trail that Bjorn had picked up. But then, they remembered some important details about the village- it was highly superstitious, and the residents did not trust people of the forest. A gang of animals- occult animals, with a black cat and everything- would not be welcome. Thankfully, though, Fidget had a cunning plan.\n\nThree minutes into his cunning plan, Fidget had coated everyone in clam chowder and had completely failed to open a bag of flour in his effort to bleach Jasper to a white, non-witchy color. As he clawed and struggled at the cloth bag, getting himself smeared in a sludgy mess with roughly the consistency of boiled snot, Jasper himself proved to be the voice of 'reason' and coated himself in the flour to avoid suspicion. Then, he sauntered into the town, under the watchful eye of Gidget.\n\nGidget got distracted by the conversations of the people in the town, and by using her keen intellect, she discovered that the people were uneasy about the death of the witch. She was occult, yes, but she kept to herself- and killing her would be terrible luck. Jasper, not paying any attention, proceeded to track the lingering scent of witch hunter to a powerfully-warded hut that would not open for a simple spell. But Jasper was a terrific climber, and had a marvelous plan.\n\nSo, with nary a thought in his head, he leapt down the chimney into the ***LOCKED, WARDED, OCCUPIED*** home of a man personally responsible for killing a magical powerhouse of a woman. When the witch hunter brandished a glowing talisman and a cudgel, Jasper realized that the world had not met his high expectations, and would promptly be making his life difficult.\n\nFidget and Gidget, having lost sight of Jasper, tried to close in to assist, but the warded hut couldn't be broken into easily by things without opposable thumbs. Bjorn prowled in, fending off inquisitive townsfolk by barking menacingly, and the three arrived just in time to see Jasper turn the situation from a bad one into a complete shitstorm. See, Jasper had noticed an amulet around the Witch Hunter's neck that glowed with runes, and in a burst of speed, he had leapt onto the man's face and torn it off his neck, disabling his hut's wards. Then, running like satan himself was following with a raging stiffie and a bottle of lube, Jasper slammed open the door and made a break for it.\n\nFidget and Gidget made a show of helping by the targeted use of greasy dinners and remote manipulation of objects into the path of the witch hunter, but it didn't work well against the Witch Hunter's personal warding rings. Bjorn, not dependant on magical tricks, promptly hounded the Witch Hunter through the streets, turning the entire thing into a giant benny hill skit. Eventually, the Witch Hunter got close enough to make a swing at Jasper, who caught a nasty bruise, but managed to escape. Fidget and Gidget attacked with their talons and pinpoint application of piping hot chili to the face, but the wards and the Witch Hunter's cudgel made this a losing proposition. Things looked bad right up until Bjorn lunged in and bit the Witch Hunter right in the danglies.\n\nGidget successfully talked everyone into running away from the absolutely infuriated, white-faced witch hunter wielding the club (though Bjorn took a few hits and was nearly caught by a concerned villager), and the group retreated to lick their wounds and consider their next move. Fortune was on their side- the Witch Hunter could not stand the thought of animals making off with his magic talisman, but he would have no assistance from the villagers, who were not comfortable with this, and saw the animal attacks as an omen of restless spirits. The Witch Hunter was going to come for them alone.\n\nSo, the gang made a trap. Bjorn put his doggish skills to work digging a deep hole with his paws, while Fidget and Gidget searched for ways to set up a snare, or something to line the pit. Fidget managed to stretch creepers and vines across the path, concealing them well enough to work as a tripwire. Gidget accidentally happened upon a venomous snake, and with some intervention from Gidget, managed to talk it into assisting them in exchange for a dinner of mice for its hungry family (Gidget was rolling quite well just now). Jasper, still injured and bruised, wore the magical amulet and positioned himself on the far side of the pit, arrogantly washing himself and giving no care to the world.\n\nWhen the Witch Hunter arrived, furious and limping, he charged at the unaware Jasper, tripping on the creepers and tumbling into the pit with the venomous snake. Several bites later, he subdued the snake with a charm, and climbed his way out of the pit and into the jaws of Bjorn. Fidget, Gidget and Jasper all leapt in on the man, a furious dogpile of teeth, beaks, and wicked claws. The Witch Hunter's protective charms were no use, but his flailing cudgel caught the injured and weary Jasper a crushing blow to the head, breaking the poor cat's neck. Soon after, Bjorn tore out the Witch Hunter's throat, and the battle was over.\n\nIn the exhausted aftermath, the owls consulted each other. The eyes of the witch hunter would bring one person back- that was the power within them. But only one... And they had two dead on their hands. Eventually it was decided that, all things considered, there were many cats in the world, but only one witch that fed and cared for them. They tearfully cared for the body of Jasper, and brought the bloody, savaged eyes of the Witch Hunter to their dead witch.\n\nAnd, miracle of miracles, she was brought back! Confused and alarmed, she inquired about the safety of her animals, and was deeply saddened to hear of her demise at the hands of the Witch Hunter, who was always jealous of her magic and power. And she expressed concern for the people of the village, who were not guilty, and would surely take this the wrong way. And finally, she mourned the death of proud Jasper, who had given his life for hers. With a hand to his head, she gave his battered soul what help she could, and sent him to a land of milk, warm sun and kipper for every meal. And so, life went on, and the Witch and her animals lived happy lives.\n\nBut nobody brought up the subject of the Witch Hunter's severed balls, which Bjorn had torn off and had improvised into a necklace.",

D1, druid 2 (D2), and the gunslinger are all inside the cube. Both druids are unconscious, and D2 has failed two death saving throws. The bard casts invisibility on himself and the cleric in a last ditch attempt to prevent a TPK, and the dogs lose track of their prey. Now, the only members of the party they can see are stuck inside the cube. One failed intelligence check later, and the dogs are attacking the cube in a desperate attempt to kill us, and even manage to paralyze it.\n\nIt is at this point that the cleric remembers he has a puling ranseur; any target he hits will be magically pulled to him upon a failed charisma save. Does he hit one of his friends trapped within the cube and pull him to safety? No. He's not going to save one of his friends; he's going to save ALL of them.\n\nThe cleric takes aim and throws the ranseur at the cube. It fails its save and is pulled in front of him, leaving the two druids and the gunslinger behind while also engulfing most of the unfortunate dogs standing in front of the cleric.\n\nAt this point, the gunslinger looks down at his companions. For the entire adventure, he's talked about how all he wants to do is go home. He's bickered with us. The cleric has tackled him on multiple occasions. But somewhere along our journey, he must have come to see us as friends, because in that moment, he takes his gun, his prized possession, and purposefully rigs it to explosively misfire before hurling it into the cube. The explosion does damage to the cube and the dogs.\n\nNow, the still invisible bard (who had maneuvered his way around the cube) manages to kill one of the dogs that had escaped the cube, and heals D2. Unfortunately, another dog manages to paralyze him and bring him to dangerously low health. The fighting continues, with some dogs managing to escape the cube. They all fall except for one, who goes for the vulnerable bard. Desperate to protect his friend, D2 dives in front of the dog, shielding the bard from the attack, but falling unconscious once more.\n\nBy this point, D1 has been revived. He promptly turns into a polar bear and eviscerates the final dog. Now, only the cube remains, separating the cleric from the rest of the party. The cleric once again hucks the ranseur at the cube. He walks to the side of the bridge, sticks his hand over the edge, and summons the ranseur. The cube is once again pulled to the cleric, and this time it has to make a dexterity saving throw.\n\nNATURAL. 20.\n\nBut it doesn't matter; even though it only takes half damage, the fall into the hedge maze does more than enough damage to kill the badly injured cube. The party begins to celebrate, thinking they have won the fight...\n\n...and then our shadows start to move.\n\nTL;DR Cleric turns gelatinous cube into a weapon, gunslinger turns gun into bomb, and a near TPK ends with exhausted party about to fight evil shadows.

        "text": "Four young scholars are sifting through a ruined library, an orange sky is visible through the broken roof. Jane turns to the others and beams her excitement, as she sees their mentor “Dr.” Friedrich coming in. “Maybe we’ll finally hear the rest of that story!” she says, tugging on David’s sleeve. By the time Dr. Friedrich has lumbered to the chair near the entrance and sat down, the scholars are all sitting cross-legged in front of him. “I suppose you want another mythology lesson, is that it?” asks Friedrich, smiling warmly. The scholars all nod their agreement. “Well, okay, yes. Hmm. Where were we? Ah yes, the charm dragon gobbled up Sillith, and spat her remains out on top of Furrio’s corpse.” “NOOO!” cries the scholars. “That’s not right! The ruins!” “Oh ho ho!” laughs Friedrich, “you’re right, we’re not nearly there yet. Now, let me see, ah yes...\n\nThe adventurers approached the place marked on their map. They got to a small clearing, where immediately Santabane stopped. As the others watched, Ara’k-azur dismounted, and looked around, confused. “Something is here,” he said. Searching around them, the party only saw a malformed tree in the center of the clearing, whose large roots appeared to be have been decorated by having small green stones attached along them, where they showed above the ground. “The tree?” asked Geldin, worried. “I don’t know,” replied Ara’k-azur, under his breath, “I just feel the presence of... something.” \n\nLight poured into the clearing as Rea* finally passed above a massive old tree visible some distance to the east. The Orc approached the tree, and the others dismounted, following him. “These stones were tied to the roots by someone,” he said, removing some of the stones to investigate them.\n\n“What are you doing?” asked Ulfbert. “Couldn’t those be dangerous?”\n\n“I don’t think so,” replied Ara’k-azur, as he removed one after another, until the entire root was bare. At that point the root sank into the ground, and the tree, wood creaking, leaned towards him. With this he stood up and walked to the next adorned root. As he touched the first stone of this one, the root wiggled. “I changed my mind,” he said.\n\nUlfbert was not discouraged. He started digging into the ground beneath that root, and soon he came to stone. Curious, he dug around the stone, until an entire elongated diamond shape was visible. With that, the root rose out of the ground, stone with it, and it hovered in front of the party, [appearing to stare at them](http://www.ciphergames.com/media/Hordes/Circle/woldwyrd.jpg). After a moment, it turned around and started gently floating due east.\n\nThis was all the party needed to see. They hopped on their mounts, and started to follow the strange thing.\n\n***\n\nThe floating root passed through a curtain of moss, and the party dismounted to follow it. The moss was covering a hole, it seemed, which went down into a sort of ravine. At the bottom of this ravine, with sun now high in the sky above them, they saw the ruins of some massive stone building. The entrance to this building was blocked by some massive logs and carved stones, all tied together. Above this, four unfamiliar runes were displayed, supposedly presenting some message to those who could speak some ancient language. The root was floating, facing the building.\n\nAra’k-azur pointed at the door. “Those logs are made of wood. Wood burns.” He and Hot Dog approached the doorway, and the hellhound began to breathe fire on the pile. In reaction to this, the logs and stones spilled forward, and started to arrange themselves into [humanoid shapes](http://store.miniwargaming.com/images/P/woldwarden_box_full.jpg). One of them slammed its fist into Hot Dog.\n\nFurrio charged one of the three figures with his maul, shattering its head. The thing groped the empty space, then swung at Furrio, but failed to coordinate enough to hit the quick warrior. Meanwhile, Sillith blasted the second figure with dark magic, as her pet started chewing on its arm. Ulfbert deftly blocked an attack meant for Hot Dog, and retaliated with his spear, knocking the third thing back.\n\nEach time Sillith cast a spell, she felt injured by the floating root, and now it shot energy at Hot Dog. This snapped Ara’k-azur into focus, and he commanded his wolves to destroy the root. Sillith’s father aided them, and together they tore it apart.\n\nSoon Furrio had smashed his foe to pieces, and held the next figure steady as Snowball tore at its limbs. As they finished this one off, Ulfbert expertly dismantled the last one, slashing at the ropes that held it together until it was no longer together to fight.\n\nWhen the battlefield was quiet, they heard a sort of repeated clicking noise, as if someone were tapping wood against rock repeatedly. Geldin pointed to the bush from where this sound seemed to be originating, and approached it, cautiously. He poked his head in, grabbed something, and came out holding what looked like a stone shield with stubby pieces of wood attached to it, and a cylindrical wooden head with a green spherical opaque eye in the center.\n\nGeldin set it down in the middle of the group. It seemed to be shivering, afraid. Furrio crouched down and approached it slowly, and tried to calm it down by cooing to it and stroking its head. It responded well to this, and did its best to hug Furrio’s leg. This was enough for the group, and for reasons now lost to time, they decided to call it “Eugene.”\n\nEugene, flapping its arms excitedly, ran into the ruined building, followed by the adventurers.\n\n***\n\nThe party reached the bottom of a long flight of stairs, and found themselves in a deep ravine in front of yet more ruins. The walls of the ravine were stone up to a point, and above the walls they could see that great tree from before just ahead, above the new ruins. Carved into the stone were various runes and pictograms, depicting such images as a tree falling on five figures of various height, and a shield being placed atop a thick humanoid figure, and a wolf’s snarling head, and a figure with wings and a halo with a sword running through it.\n\nBetween them and the ruins were three statues, [two very thick and dangerous looking](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/file/view/woldguardian.png/140314489/296x260/woldguardian.png) but dormant, and one standing in front of a thick stone doorway, almost human-looking, staring at them intently. Furrio carefully moved forward, and noted that the statue moved its head to follow him. However close as got, though, it would not attack.\n\nWhile the others were comfortable with this and got to investigating the runes, Sillith walked forward, near the statue. She stared up at it for a few second, and seemed to have an idea. “Are you really really really really stupid?” she asked. Then, she ran to the statue’s far left, and then in front of it again, and to the right, back and forth twice more. This caused the statue to move its head left and right following her, as if it were shaking its head. She dropped to the ground, and giggled in delight. Soon this entertainment wore off, and she went to go see what the others were doing.\n\nGeldin had just finished writing down what appeared to be the important text from the wall. “Must be Auroran,” he said. “That’s what Jorge said, Auroran ruins, aye. So I think we c’n take these here runes an’ get a scholar in New Aurora to the North to translate them.”\n\nFurrio was looking intently at the runes. “Nobody here knows any Auroran, do they?” There was no response. “Alright. I guess we should do that.” He sounded disappointed (his face, as always, being hidden behind his visor, was impossible to read). “As for these ruins, I have a plan.”\n\nFurrio drew his arm up into the air, and the ground beneath him rumbled. An elemental of stone rose out from the keph, and looked to Furrio. “Not to worry, friends, he’s with me,” the Ogrun said. He made some inarticulate grunting noises at the elemental, which nodded its... upper body in understanding. The elemental walked through the stone door like so much water, then after a moment came back. Furrio spent a few minutes trying to get it to mime for him what was in the room, but, unfortunately for him, stone elementals don’t speak, and so no information was gleaned about the building ahead.\n\nUlfbert pointed to the pictogram of the shield above the humanoid form. “Hey, that kind of looks like Eugene, right?”\n\n“Eugene’s not that fat,” replied Sillith.\n\n“I meant the shield, not the statue.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nFurrio grabbed Eugene, and placed it on top of one of the dormant statues. It nodded its understanding, and kicked the statue’s head off. Climbing into the hole where the head was, it seemed to gain control of the statue, and started clumsily walking it to the stone door.\n\nThe humanoid statue stepped out of Eugene’s way. Eugene swung back the thick statue’s massive arm, and rammed it into the door, caving it in alongside much of the building around it. An echoing boom rang out from the door, and rocks fell from the walls of the ravine. The stairway they came down started to collapse, and the party knew they only had a moment to make a choice.\n\nEugene hopped out of its statue, and walked forward into the new building beneath the tree. There was no decision left to make, and the party followed it in.\n\n***\n\nThe building appeared even larger on the inside. The walls rose up and became the walls of the ravine, the roof was mostly natural, and the roots of that massive tree were growing down into the building, with some so long you could almost jump up and touch them. The first thing the adventurers noticed, according to their nature, was the fortune in gold and jewels lying around the walls. The second thing they noticed was the [massive statue](http://www.wargamestore.com/images/T/file643040b51e864e90b6b88c696ca8061d-01.jpg), not powered, and similar to the others, standing sentinel above a big stone sarcophagus. Only third they noticed the other few statues, similar to the human-like one outside, these powered on and watching.\n\nThe spectre of an old shamanic orc, wielding sword in one hand and staff in the other, rose out of the sarcophagus. It screamed at them in an ancient tongue that only Furrio could understand, “Bringers of the apocalypse! You have entered my domain! You shall perish!” The spectre waved its staff, and Eugene’s green light turned red. As chunks of dirt fell from the roof above (for the slow collapse of the building had not stopped), Eugene climbed up into the massive statue, and seemed to gain control of it, lighting the entire thing red. It and the spectre stepped forward together.\n\nFurrio and his elemental moved as one straight at the spectre. Sillith cried out, “Furrio! Ghosts can only be hurt by magic and magical weapons!” Whether he heard or not, Furrio slashed at the spectre with his sword. The spectre’s form wavered briefly, and ectoplasm gushed from the place Furrio’s sword hit it. “Oh, you’ve got a magical weapon, alright, then,” said Sillith.\n\nSillith turned her attention to the statue to her left. Geldin had already charged into it, and was busily deflecting blow after powerful blow. Snowball and Sillith’s father surrounded the statue with him, and Sillith started to wear it down magically amid the cat, “man,” and dwarf’s storm of blows. \n\nSeeing this, Ulfbert motioned to Ara’k-azur and charged the rightmost statue alongside the pack of wolves. “I’m fine dealing with this ghost and massive statue alone, thanks,” called Furrio. \n\n“Oh, perfect,” replied Ulfbert, shielding the stone fists attempting to beat down on Two-Faced-Sonofabitch, “I was going to go help, but as long as you’ve got it.”\n\nThe spectre ran straight into Furrio, but appeared to be stopped  by something (other than Furrio’s physical presence, as it did partially manage to occupy the same space). It screamed at an ancient tongue in Furrio’s face, but Furrio never did tell the others what exactly it said. They screamed unknowable words at each other, until Furrio yelled back at his compatriots, “this thing’s like a recording! It keeps going on about bringers of the apocalypse, I don’t think it’s really intelligent.”\n\nFurrio turned his attention to the elemental, which had once again become totally encompassed by the massive statue’s fist. Although it was wearing the elemental down, it was able to sort of phase into the stone fist as it came into contact with it, and so doing, avoided most of the force, and distracting the monstrous statue for the sake of the others. Inspiration struck Furrio then, but so too did a bolt of lightning from the spectre.\n\nAt this moment, a bolt of green energy jumped from Ara’k-azur to the spectre, appearing to harm it. With all that was going on, nobody saw it fit to comment on this, but it did draw Sillith’s attention. She drew her own enchanted rapier, and ran at the spectre. As her tip penetrated the translucent torso, it grabbed hold of her head, and poured into her. Furrio finished giving orders to his elemental, and turned to see Sillith, now with eyes glowing red.\n\nUlfbert started to say, “okay, that’s not good, let’s figure out a plan to carefully subdue and exorcise her, then deal with these statues,” but before he got to “good,” Furrio smashed the young elf in the face with his left fist, drawing blood.\n\n***\n\nA small elven girl sits alone in her father’s private study. She has stolen a book of legends, and was reading about a necromancer’s defeat by a very clever elven warrior. Her father, a stout, severe man, entered the study silently, and crept up behind her. “I thought I’d find you in here.”\n\nThe girl jumped out of his large armchair, and dropped the book. “I- I’m sorry, I-”\n\nHer father shook his head and shushed her. “You know not to go in here, my love. I go here to relax, and it’s not for nosy little girls. You should be in the courtyard, training. Enn gave you a longer lifespan than the humans so that you could train longer, not so you could squander it on books.”\n\n“But this story!” she cried, “it’s so cool! I want to read more stuff like it.”\n\n“Hmm? Which one? Oh ho ho, you’re reading about Illisir and Kelgouth, that one is a classic. I used to travel with him, you know.”\n\n“The necromancer?”\n\n“No, of course not, silly girl. Illisir, the warrior. He taught me what a big brain can do for warriors like us. This is the story where he abuses the necromancer’s instructions to his minions and turns them against him, right? Very clever. See, a necromancer does not control his undead mentally, he prepares them with careful instructions, like, ‘hurt anything that hurts me.’ So, he forced the necromancer to draw his own blood, and that was that.”\n\nShe just looked up at her father in awe. “So... so can I keep reading to- to learn more and become a better warrior?”\n\nThe stout man drew his face up into something like a smile. That’s when he did it. *Thwap!*\n\n“Do not test me, Sillith. You are to be outside training, and that’s that. You will become a great warrior, and that’s enough of these silly stories. I will see you outside in five minutes for fencing, and you will have cleaned the blood from your face”\n\nAfter her father closed the study door behind him, Sillith began to cry. The spectre materialized beside her. “Why are we here,” she asked.\n\n“Use this anger, Sillith. Give into it. I can give you my power, and we can take revenge.”\n\nSillith looked up at the spectre, a determined look on her face.\n\n***\n\nThe elf’s body flew back from the force of Furrio’s blow. Rather than hit the ground, it hovered for a moment, and then righted itself. Sillith looked at Furrio, wearing a crooked smile, and wiped the blood away.\n\nUlfbert sighed. “Ara’k-azur, you cover this statue, I need to help Furrio.” He charged the possessed elf, and tried to skewer her with his spear. She dodged out of the way, and jabbed at him with her rapier, but it could not pierce his thick armour. They kept this back and forth up while Furrio got into position behind her.\n\nSeeing this, Snowball and Sillith’s father turned their attention from the statue to Geldin. He began to slowly back away, and was unable to block attacks coming from all three sources. He took a couple of bad hits from the statue in front of him, but held strong.\n\nFurrio’s elemental dove into the big statue’s foot, and started to “swim” up it. Soon it was at the head, where Eugene seemed to be controlling the thing. The elemental wrested Eugene free with some effort, and tossed it to the ground, and the massive statue started to slowly fall backwards.\n\nFurrio grabbed Sillith by the back of the head, and slashed her back with his free hand. Following up, Ulfbert whacked her with the dull end of his spear, and she fell to the ground. The spectre floated out of her, and Furrio swiftly drove his sword through it, finally causing it to dissipate completely. Eugene’s light went out as it hit the ground, and the massive statue fell into the wall opposite to the entrance, causing it to collapse outward. The building’s slow crumble accelerated, and the roof itself seemed to come unbound, and it slowly descended.\n\nFurrio picked up Sillith. “Let’s get out of here!” he cried, at the same time that she managed to wheeze, “get out,” to her father and pet.\n\nEverybody stopped their fighting, and ran for the newly created exit. Except, of course, for the statues, one of which managed to grab Snowball. Before anyone could react, the statue tore Snowball’s head clean off, and tossed it to the ground, shattering it. “Just go,” someone called, and they just went, many grabbing gold and jewels from the floor on the way.\n\nGeldin, slowest of the bunch, was the last to get out, and just barely, for as he jumped out into the open air behind the wall, the roof finished collapsing, and the ruins were no more.  The ground within the building had even collapsed a bit, and the great tree above it was now just below the level of the party.\n\n***\n\n“It’s a prophecy.” Furrio had been looking intently at incredible sketches Geldin had drawn of the writing around the courtyard before, which preserved every detail, including the appearance of the stone on which the runes were carved.\n\n“How can ye tell?” Geldin asked.\n\n“I can speak this language. I didn’t say anything before because I... wasn’t sure, but now I am.”\n\n“How’s it an Ogrun’s goin’ round knowin’ ancient languages?”\n\n“That’s racist,” replied Furrio, in a tone that did nothing to inspire further confidence. “Do you want to know what it says or not?”\n\n“Tell us,” they all said. Sillith was sitting up, her wounds having been mended by Ulfbert and Furrio. She was still mourning Snowball, and not really listening to the others.\n\n“Then tell me what order these were in back in the ruins,” Furrio said to Geldin.\n\n“Ech, I can’t. I jus’ wrote those rough sketches quickly, di’n’t think they’d be c’nected.”\n\n“Very well, I’ll just read them in the order they’re in here.\n\n*“I am named Ta’k-ros, prophet of the aurorans. I have been granted vision over these events, for I shall still walk on Keph’s ground until they are near culmination, either in body or in spirit. This is what I have seen.*\n\n*“I can see not whether this evil will fall again, but I see clear that it shall not be reborn twice. Whether this fact bodes well or ill, I cannot tell, for the spirit who shows me loves mystery.*\n\n*“A great evil has driven us from the land we call home. This evil is ageless, and if ever it is slain, its power shall become that of a god’s, and an army shall rise under its service. This I see shall come to pass.*\n\n*“This removal will have dire consequences. The decisions around it will decide entirely the fate of the world long after, but I cannot see beyond this point, for I, of course, shall no longer walk the Keph at this time, and so this area is hazy.*\n\n*“Although I cannot see how, this swift removal will be welcome. I see clearly that it will be necessary for peace of the soul, and for peace of the land.*\n\n*“Four shall come to the evil: One with true identity oft hidden, One a great friend to that creature he rides, One brave without unnatural power, One a misguided agent of chaos.*\n\n*“As they approach the Evil, the Four shall be spirited out of reality as it is known to us. They will be surprised by this unforeseen removal, but it will reveal much to them.*\n\n*“I shall be present at the discovery of this great Evil. I shall be removed from the realm of Kephrea before the Evil is confronted, and taken to the land of the dead at last.”*\n\nThey looked among each other. “Well, that’s not us,” said Furrio. “There’s six of us.”\n\n“Six?” asked Arak-azur.\n\n“Me, you, Ara’k-azur, Sillith, Geldin, and Sillith’s father.”\n\n“Oh, I see your mistake. You forgot Santabane, Hot Dog, Two-Faced-Sonofabitch, and Sky Bite because they’re off scouting ahead right now.”\n\n“Yes,” said Furrio, “that’s exactly why I didn’t count them.”\n\n“Well I don’t know about you guys,” said Ara’k-azur, “but I sure love Santabane. If it’s not about us ten, then maybe I’m included. And Metal-Bender and Knee-Crusher are very brave, but have no unnatural power.” Ara’k-azur also looked at Sillith. “So that leaves someone who’s hiding their identity.”\n\nEveryone looked at Sillith’s silent father.\n\n“Well I don’ think it’s abou’ me, anyway,” said Geldin. “After tha’ collapse ther, I think I’m done wit’ advernturin’ fer a while. Aft’r all, I’ve got me wife’s funeral t’ attend t’.”\n\nThere were mutters of disappointment, and someone muttered, “I forgot about that.”\n\n“Well I don’t have ‘unnatural’ power either,” said Furrio, as his elemental slid back into the ground, “so I’ll bet I’m included. All things considered I’d bet Ulfbert’s included too, after all we don’t know much about his past.”\n\n“We don’t know literally anything at all about yours,” replied Ulfbert.\n\n“But I’ll let that slide,” continued Furrio, ignoring him, “because it looks like we all have a destiny together, and a big one. Adventurers like us don’t just come across prophecies all willy nilly, I think that whatever this evil is, we’re destined to vanquish it.”\n\n“I can think of someone else it might be about” said Sillith. “Do you know the story of the four heroes who killed Tyranny?” Some nodded, others shook their heads. “Very well. Listen up.”\n\n*Rhea is the name given to the star which Keph orbits, the realm, domain of living things, etc, being called Kephrea, like \"Earth\" was used before it began to refer only to our planet. Rhea is also the name of the sun goddess, and Keph the name of the earth god, both so to speak.",

        "text": "It's been awhile since I've had an audio clip from [our epic campaign of Vampire the Masquerade](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com) (now over three and a half years running). Or rather, a while since I've had one that works outside the context of the game. This one, though, came up recently and I think it will be appreciated by anyone at all familiar with the world, or even just general fans of GM fuckery.\n\nFirst, a touch of background:\n\nI play Tom Lytton, a massive Brujah as gay as he is gorgeous, prone to decisions that are terrible in retrospect but [seemed pretty awesome at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2phxnk/vampire_the_masquerade_why_you_dont_give_a_brujah/?). Recently in our plot he made one bad decision too many, got Blood Hunt called on him by the Camarilla authorities of San Francisco (or at least, the ones still left alive), then got hunted down by the other player characters. Rather than killing Tom, though, one of the other PCs decided to make an example out of him and had him taxidermied and staked up against a wall as decoration during a massive party. A week or so after this, due to circumstances still unclear, someone stole Tom from the middle of the party and ran off with him, running the full length of the bay to find sanctuary in San Jose with the Sabbat. The Archbishop of the Sabbat, a Malkavian named Liedesdorff, begrudgingly took Tom in as a favor to whomever stole him (who may or may not have been associated with the Black Hand, still unclear). Once Tom was healed, Liedesdorff told Tom in no uncertain terms that he was to stay put in Sabbat territory and keep the fuck out of trouble.\n\nWhich means, of course, that Tom ran off as soon as he could, *and* convinced half of Liedesdorff's War Party to come with him.\n\nThis scene opens with Tom just having left the California Academy of Sciences, which he broke into to recover a bunch of guns and weapons stolen from him before the Blood Hunt by the curator of the museum (who also happens to be a dragon). Some of the other PCs have learned Tom is back in town and are looking for him, and Liedesdorff has been leaving angry messages. Tom's ignoring all this, though, because his main concern at the moment is trying to figure out how to trick a load of Red Talon werewolves into going to Marin to fight a bunch of Black Spiral Dancers trying to end the world. You know, as you do. \n\nAnother character mentioned in this scene is Leeland, the Toreador Chancellor of UC Berkeley who would rather be left to his school but keeps getting dragged into werewolf bullshit, [as we've seen before](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/37aqke/vampire_the_masquerade_why_its_important_to_keep/?).\n\nAnyway, without further ado, to the clip:\n\nhttp://raptor.zombox.org/vampire_recordings/2016_04_26_Toms_Sabbat_buddies.mp3",

        "text": "This is going to be somewhat brief, if only because I can't recall all the details. Facebook timeline is telling me that today is the fourth anniversary of one of the most insane gaming sessions that I have had the privilege of GM'ing. \n\nFor a little background, the party consisted of five godlings; abandoned children of the gods who'd learned of their heritage. They are the daughter of Sun Wukong (the Chinese monkey god of fighting); the daughter of Hecate, the Greek goddess of magic; the son of Hermes, the Roman god of messengers and medicine; and the son of Baron Samedi, the voodoo god (?) of zombies and death magic. The campaign's BBEG was Janus, the Roman god of portals (who could teleport anywhere as a move action, and who was also all-seeing, so he could follow every step the party took).\n\nIf this seems a little sparse on details, it's because this was originally a facebook status post, but the craziness inherent was quite typical of the sessions in that campaign.\n\nJanus starts a smear campaign against the party. To retaliate, two PCs go to Jimmy Kimmel Live (create a thunderstorm inside the studio, Liam Neeson is shot in the knee), and then Conan O'Brian's show (\"whooo, team coco!\" shouts the new Sun Wukong) and give free interviews.\n\nBaldur and Freya are suspended in animation to prevent the mere possibility of Ragnarok. Freya is almost assassinated. One PC steals a deer from a local zoo, they sacrifice it in a local park.\n\nYahweh visits them in their dreams. Lucifer bids the plane of creation goodbye.\n\nA covert force attacks Disney World, tries to take it back from Baron Samedi's control. The PCs go all-out super-saiyan avatar, and animate ALL the Disney characters, to fight alongside. Mickey, Donald and Goofy, the 7 Dwarves, and more, are all sacrificed to fuel the PCs' powers.\n\nHecate is subdued, her essence eaten. One PC, Shyham, dies from a sneak headshot from Janus; is reborn when Baron Samedi doesn't take his soul but sloughs off his mortality instead. Denny's becomes a local shrine to Shyham.",

        "text": "I originally posted this in /r/burningwheel, but my players asked me to post it here as well. I should probably mention here that Burning Wheel has a failed casting table, and we basically rolled as good/bad as possible on it depending on your point of view. Anyway, here comes the story about how a broken led lead to the start of the apocalypse.\n\nFirst a bit of background to our campaign. Our situation is the conflict between the citizens in a remote region of a large kingdom and the supernatural beings that are living in the land. The civilized parts are basically medieval Sweden, and the supernatural parts are taken from 19th century nordic folklore. I added a few sprinkles of norse mythology in ancient ruins and old stories as well.\n\nReligion was initially not something I had given much thought, but one of my players decided to take gravedigger and cultist lifepaths and made his backstory that he been working for the church and slowly been manipulated into aiding some kind of evil cult in it. So we created the idea of the gods being gone from the setting and that big religion instead had some idea of being holy or following a holy spirit. The cult was trying bring the gods back, especially the god caused the war between the gods in the first place. This would also explain why the cult was connected to the church. \n\nFast forwarding a bit. The group has travelled a bit, helping out villages and trying when they can to find a balance between the supernaturals and the humans and dwarves and they’ve had run in with the cult as well. Lars, a fat cobbler in his 50ies and the informal leader of the group, gets his leg injured when a pack of huge wolves attacks his horse. The start looking around for a competent healer, something that turns out to be rare in this part of the world. In the end they decide to go back to an old friend of theirs who is skilled in herbs and the ancient art of sejd singing. She heals the leg and attempts to cast blessed hands, which results in the aforementioned unintended summoning. \n\nSo between sessions I was left with the dilemma of coming up with how a chief deity can show up when the gods are dead. I thought for a while that one idea could be the gods being resurrected, but that felt a bit anti-climactic considering my players are working against a cult who are working very hard to achieve that thing. My other idea was to just make the most powerful living divine being show up. In the end I kind of went with the second idea, but with a twist. \n\nToday’s session started where the last ended. The group is still inside the witch’s hut when a bright light starts shining through the window and then the temperature starts getting hotter. In the middle of the village there is now a pillar of fire reaching the sky, and emerging from the fire comes Ildariel, the last of the fire spirits, the first of the seraphim, queen of the heavens, and guardian of the gods. \n\nShe proclaims that humankind has been fooling around with magic without understanding what effects that could have on the divine realms, and because of that the eight seals (that keeps the eight gods from returning) have begun to crumble. She went on to say that humankind must restore restore the holy metal in order to stop the process. \nAt this point the dwarf in the group who doesn’t worship gods decided that he could probably talk her into making deal. After all dwarves knows things about metal and she seemed reasonable. He failed, and she just told him to be silent. \n\nShe then pointed out that a thief turned pilgrim character (who had the faithful trait) had the right idea of things. This was perhaps a heavy handed way for us to introduce a new character to the group for a player who had been gone since the beginning of the campaign and wanted a new start. \n\nThe warrior of the group then commanded the goddess to tell him more about the metal and what they were suppose to do with it. For that she casted Lights of St. Andrew on him and the dwarf and told them that this was their final warning. Perhaps she was a bit too patient, but I wanted to show them how powerful she was before that would result in their instant death.\n\nShe the proclaimed that she would take the witch with her and a punishment for the misuse of magic. The players who hadn’t just been stunned tried to beg her to show mercy, but failed their persuade test. So the witch disappeared in a ray of light which came down from the sky. \n\nIldariel then proclaimed that she would return to the village after eight days, and after eight weeks, and after eight months, and after eight years to check on their progress. She then disappeared but the pillar of fire remained in the middle of the village. \n\nThe party then debated for a bit on what they would do and the three big ideas was to through a lot of the holy metal into the pillar of fire (which I really hope they do considering one PC is a greedy dwarf), killing all wizards or at least making sure that no-one ever uses sorcery again, and the third option travel south and tell the inquisition to take over.\n\nThere is one more thing I’d like to share that happened during tonight’s session and that was the warrior (the guy who tried to command a goddess) had apparently not learned his lesson about hierarchy in a feudal society because he later got whipped after talking back to her grace the high inquisitor of Ytterland Regina Lorrensteiner von Hansenholm the third.",

        "text": "Aright, this is the story of Crowthorn the Spiritualist, and his spiritual partner, who would later be named, \"the green dangler.\"  Preface: the spiritualist's int is as low as he can get, his spirit is a large phantom of jealousy that used to be Crowthorn's partner in a buddy cop situation and hates when anyone interacts extensively with his master, The spirit is green and more often than not stark naked, and the bard is a narcissistic trouble stirrer.  These two characters do not like each other very much, and there have been multiple acts of random hypnotism, touches of idiocy, public defacing, and some other incidences between the two.  Never outright attacking or anything, but more of a grudge to see who could mess with the other the most.  \n\nSo the spiritualist, a celebrity bard, a zen acher, and a sacred hunt inquisitor have received a clue that within the capital of my homebrew world, there was someone possibly working for the BBG.  After finding another possible clue, the team decides to go and report their evidence to the city's guard captain.  Upon arriving, they are told by the captain's secretary that the captain is currently in a meeting and the group will have to make an appointment to see him.  The team makes an appointment and then heads out of the building.  In order to buy some time the party wants to go visit a magical item shop and browse around, but Crowthorn had other ideas. \n\nThe player in charge of Crowthorn turn to me the DM and says, and I quote, \"I want to make a disturbance.\"  A little confused I say \"okaaaayyy.... what would you like to do?\" and the following proceeds.  Crowthorn casts fly and flies into the air and with his spirit begins yelling at the top of his lungs demanding he guard captain come out and speak with him.  Several guards in the area approach and tell him to come down and that he is making a ruckus.  Crowthorn replies to this by maintaining his yelling and casting random spells into the air like lightning bolt and such in order to cause a bigger scene.  At this point, the guards draw their crossbows and begin ordering him to cease his actions or they will use force.  As you can imagine, Crowthorn had no intention of stopping.  Crossbows fire.  Now Crowthorn was a damage sponge and just took the bolts like a champ and carried on, so our celebrity bard decides he has an idea.   He begins trying to summon a crowd (lvl10 so a large crowd) using his ability to due so. He rolls a d10 to determine how many rounds it would take for the crowd to gather and miraculously rolls a 1.  Fantastic.  The bard being very proficient as a public speaker begins trying to rally the people to stand up against this menace in the sky and rid him of THEIR city.  He rolls a 52 on his perform/diplomacy and the crowd now wants blood.  Now, in addition to the barrage of crossbow bolts being shot at Crowthorn, all of the townspeople begin throwing rocks and debris up at him in order to try and drive him off.  After a couple of rounds of this mess, with the bard actively spurring everyone on, the guard captain emerges from his office with his super amazing greatsword on his back.  Seeing this, Crowthorn flies down to meet him to discuss the BBG's plans and is met with a greatsword to the face.  Crowthorn, now having had taken a great deal of damage dimension doors away to safety.  \n\nFollowing this incident, the team, with Crowthorn near permanently disguised begin seeing wanted posters of him and his partner, \"the Green Dangler\" all around town and in neighboring cities.  More happens later, but that is a whole different story.",

        "text": "I played (and currently play) Pinky on a forum tabletop RPG which uses a mix of Fallout and Shadowrun as a setting, following the adventures of various people in a post-apocalyptic Western US coast after a nuclear war that ravaged the world.\n\nPinky, her official nickname by the way, is a character I made during my weeaboo phase following almost all the tropes of anime : an robot girl with an AI able to imitate human behaviour, waist-length bright pink hair, a katana as her main weapon, maxed-out hand to hand and melee skills (with of course a bonus to bladed weapons), very good with guns, a master of sneak (cuz ninjas ; yeah, I was stupid) with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the pre-War world and technology in general. And of course, above-average stats everywhere and a smoking hot body. Very good on paper, but as I discovered later, all of this came with a huge flaw : Pinky can't heal. Without a skilled enough engineer and the right components, any damage received will stay for good, with makeshifts repairs at best. I dismissed it at the time,  thinking that I was too awesome to ever be hit by anything...\n\nAfter a few quests and a 3 year-long pause due to personal problems, I came back to the game. The GM let me in again to the condition I kept Pinky in her current state. Having grown out of the weeaboo and with much more experience at tabletop now, I accepted.\n\nAfter her last quest where she had to find, with the help of a mercenary troop, a lost magical flying city that crashed in the Californian desert, Pinky found herself in said city. Without me, the mercs unearthed and unknowingly activated it, which also broke out of magical stasis the four very confused and powerful 15th century mages ruling it. One curbstomp later, only Pinky and a mercenary engineer were still alive. The engineer ended up with a slave collar and programmed her to obey the mages, who wanted to become one of the Wasteland's top dogs despite having no idea where they were or how to do it. At this point, I thought the GM screwed me for giving up (especially since I took wounds during the battle) and thought about quitting, but things dawned on me.\n\nI had in my hands a character that could slice and dice or punch to death people without too much hassle, but could also act as an assassin-style character using stealth and guns, keeping melee as her last resort. And it would lessen the risks of getting hurt (the engineer could do some makeshift repairs, but nothing too important). Exit Pinky the shonen hero, enter Pinky the Wasteland's assassin.\n\nWilling to try their new toy (the mages saw her as a more complex and intelligent golem), the mages sent me and one of them in the nearest city, where the mage tried to make some money by putting me in the town arena and betting on my victories. After cutting through the opponents without being hit (the GM confessed they had awful rolls), the final boss of the arena faced me. A few katana strikes and a critical dodge later (described as \"jumping over his claymore when he swung it at me\" by the GM, which resulted on the crowd going bananas), the boss KO'd himself by headbutting me. He was bareheaded, my skull is made of titanium. A few hundreds dollars richer, I discovered the mage who came with me was kidnapped during the matches by a local gang who either would sell her as a slave or use her powers to crush their competition, and also because they were losing a ton of money on bets with her (rule number 1 of betting : the betting shop is here for that, not the suspicious looking guys).\n\nMy restraining program ticks in, I have no choice but to go save her. Armed with only a knife, my sword, a M4 and one grenade, I fail my infiltration of their hideout and a gunfight ensues. With the grenade, half a magazine and a few knife strikes, the whole gang lies dead in 6 turns with only a broken rib for Pinky after being pistol whipped. I walk out with the wounded but alive mage and more than 10 grand of loot. A few NPCs spot what happened and add \"gangster eliminator\" to my rep, already bolstered by my near-flawless victory in the arena.\n\nAnd that's how Pinky went from someone out of a manga to a decent character worthy of her reputation. That's player development for you.",

        "text": "I originally wrote this for the comment section of a webcomic, asking us to share our favorite story about area-of-effect things, before I realized that it would work perfectly here on Reddit as well. It's a little terse as a result.\n\nMy first experience DM-ing was for a game of Pathfinder for my friends. They had built some level 10 characters with the intent to fight each other in some sort of arena thing, but that never came to fruition. I took the opportunity to offer the chance to use their characters in a little adventure.\n\nOne of the players had originally designed their character as a level-adjusted Marid with class levels, which would mean that she'd be a nasty physical presence and also unimpeded by water. With this in mind, I found my now-favorite monster: the Chuul. A group of three of the surfacing from the lake in this cave would make a good challenge for them, as they would grab with their claws, then move them to their tentacles, and finally try to submerge with their food. The Marid would have been a pain for them to grapple, and could enter the water to rescue anyone who got grappled. Easy peasy, right?\n\nThe Marid player decided his character was a little nuts (I can't remember how I contributed to that thought, if I did at all) and made a new character, a Wizard this time. Now, the party consisted of a half-orc double weapon Fighter, an ifrit Sorcerer, our new Wizard, and a ratfolk Rogue.\n\nSo, the adventure went rather smoothly, apart from Mr. Wizard insisting on crafting himself a weapon overnight I'm not sure he was able to use. I ended up restricting him to fewer spells until he actually took time to rest. They fought some chumpy Morlocks, and a cranky Earth Elemental that they woke up. Finally they made their way into the cavern with the three Chuul, which I had failed to adjust for the lack of beefy Marid Monk.\n\nCombat ensued, and half of the party got grappled within two rounds. The Fighter was hacking away, the Sorcerer burnt a few, and the Rogue faffed about setting a trap that did nothing. The Wizard, now grappled, decided things were going poorly. As in, poorly enough that a point-blank Fireball, with the entire party in the radius, was a good idea.\n\nMiraculously, nobody died. I'm laughing my ass off, and the players are all extremely mad at the Wizard for roasting everybody. If I recall correctly, things were actually going pretty well in the fight; the worst thing that happened were the grapples, which still left enough time for the Fighter to hack them to pieces. Overall, the Wizard hurt them more than the Chuul did!\n\nThey made it through the next encounter, more Morlocks and a Giant Slug with a Mite riding its back. Unfortunately, the adventure petered out before the bosses, twin Medusae and a gaggle of Morlocks. Overall, I was pretty happy with how it went. Every so often we recall the event, and I get a mad cackle as the Wizard player draws some fire again.\n\nAll in all, I'd love to be able to DM for them again, if only to make them fight more Chuul.",

        "text": "Last night, during our weekly session of Through the Breach, the stars aligned in a beautiful way.\n\nIn our previous session, the party managed to take down some kind of two-headed werewolf creature with black, acidic blood. We were fairly injured from the fight, and a thankful mayor let us use one of the empty homes in his town to rest up.\n\nThe mayor sent someone for us the next morning, but we were very tired, so we told him to go away, caught some more Zs, then woke up and had breakfast. We had a gremlin in the party that started cooking bacon for everyone.\n\nIt was roughly around this time that I remembered something. The town we were staying in was named 'Providence'. Not a crazy name for a town in a game where fate is super important, but I made an off-hand comment, 'Oh, I didn't realize we were in Rhode Island this whole time'.\n\nThe GM started laughing. It had completely slipped his mind that there was a city in Rhode Island named Providence. The capital, no less. I kept the joke going, interspersing comments here and there. Collated, the conversation between me and my GM looked something like this.\n\n\"I want to cook up some clam fritters.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"You know, clam fritters. Fried dough with bits of clam meat inside.\"\n\n\"Oh. Uh, okay?\"\n\n\"It's a Rhode Island specialty.\"\n\nHe laughs for a second. \"Okay, well, you don't have any clams.\"\n\n\"Well we're in Rhode Island. I'm assuming there are just clams all over the place here.\"\n\nAt this point another party member asked if we were even near a body of water. \"Well, yes, actually, you're in a marshy area. There's a lake nearby.\"\n\n\"Okay, cool, I'd like to go to the lake.\"\n\n\"Alright. You go to the lake. Doctor Crenshaw (My character's name.) is now dead.\"\n\n\"Cool, cool. I want to make a clamming check.\"\n\n\"Sure. Go ahead and flip, but if you get a black joker you are dead.\"\n\nNow, at this point, everything had been pretty much 100% facetious. I knew I wasn't dead. The GM knew I wasn't dead. And as far as both of us were concerned, I hadn't even gone to this lake in the first place.\n\nBut then I flipped the black joker.\n\nFor those who don't know, in Through the Breach, you use a deck of cards instead of dice. So if I had a 5 in a skill, and flipped a 10 of whatever, the end result is a 15. The best possible flip is the red joker, which is basically a critical success, and the worst possible flip is the black joker, which is a critical failure. A few cards had already been drawn from the deck. There was a 1/50 chance that the card I drew was the black joker. And it was.\n\nEveryone loses it, but I decide to double down. \"Alright, well, this is canon now. Doctor Baxter Crenshaw has died in a clamming-related accident.\" I decided to retroactively justify it- saying my character was actually from Providence, Rhode Island, originally, and that as a doctor he had developed a taste for some unsavory pharmaceuticals, and on a particularly bad day he had a lapse of cognizance and wandered out to do some clamming in a terrible place. We decided that after breakfast, my character muttered something about getting some shellfish and left without another word.\n\nFor the next hour and a half of play, the rest of the party started getting things done, talking to NPCs and all that. Numerous times, they were asked \"I thought there was one more of you. Where is he?\" The session ended with them finally agreeing to go find out what happened. I'm pretty sure it's not *actually* clam-related, but I'm happy no matter what.\n\nIn the background of our Discord call, one of the GM's roommates commented, \"You not knowing the name of Rhode Island's capital just killed his character.\"",

        "text": "Cast: Jake (GM), Leo Bonhart (Chiss, Bounty hunter), Verity Newman (Corellian Human, Bounty hunter), Papalazzarou (Human, Mechanic)\n \nAs the empire imposed martial law over most of the inner rim in order to keep the peace work for smugglers and even honest traders became harder and harder.\nVerity and Papalazzarou found temporary work cutting wrecked ships apart for salvage for a small salvage company, the pay was poor and the work was potentially dangerous but it was better than starving to death.\n \nWhen the both turned up to the landing pad here they were to meet their boss they were confronted by what appeared to be a piece of flying junk, an old wayfarer class freighter with enough questionable scorch marks on it to raise more than mild concern was sitting there like a piece of disused scrap, Verity prayed that that wasn't the ship they were working with but a feeling deep down told her otherwise.\n \nA twi'lek briskly walked up to them and firmly shook their hands \"Hello my name is T'Loth, I take it you’re the new blood who will be working for me\"\n\"We are, is that the ship we will be using to get to the site?\" Verity asks while Papalazzarou is busy try to not burst into tears at the sight of such a poorly abused ship.\n\"Yes, she might not look like much but she'll get you there and back in one piece\" and with that T'Loth walked off, as the two boarded the death trap, they noticed the pilot was a Chiss, and a heavily armed one at that.\n \nThe wayfarer took off and with a couple of shudders and only a minor loss of power to the weapon systems got into a low orbit in order to map a route to the wrecked freighter they would be salvaging. a small screen flickered to life in the cargo bay, Verity and Papalazzarou read the terms of the job, they were only going to get paid ten credits per crate of scrap metal plus a variable amount for anything more expensive such as weapons systems and intact data terminals.\n \nAfter what seem to take an age Leo pulled up at the site of the wreckage, it appeared to an old YT-1300 that had been torn into two pieces, and judging by the blast marks all along the hull not by accident, he opened the cargo holds main door after the crew had gotten suited up into their space suits and the began to float their way to the wreckage.\n \nPapalazzarou took one side with two other crew members and Verity took the other with the other two members and they began to take the ship apart from the inside. Papalazzarou found a partially intact control terminal that would bag him a nice bonus to the ten credits a crate he was going to be getting anyway and quickly cut the system out of its housing and hauled it to the cargo hold, verity while cutting through one of the corridors fond a secret compartment, inside was  an old blaster pistol, probably there as a last defence, she quickly pocketed the weapon and continued to work.\n \nTime past slowly as the number of full crates piled up in the cargo hold as Leo scanned the area for any incoming vessels, unfortunately in a ship this beat up that was easier said than done as the display kept cutting out and showing interference, thinking it was nothing he ignored the interference and proceeded to attempt percussive maintenance on the terminal.\n \nA few hours past and Papalazzarou  worked his way to the where the dorsal turret was housed and to his surprise it was still there and fairly intact, he took it upon himself to cut it free being careful not to cut through anything that was keeping the wreck together, unfortunately he neglected to notice he as cutting through one of the main structural beams to get that the turret and as the turret was pulled free of its housing the whole half of the ship started to warp and twist, the hull was collapsing and he was bang smack in the middle of it he quickly hauled his prized loot from the wreck and made a beeline to the wayfarers cargo hold, as he cleared the ship the hull collapsed into itself rendering what was left of that part of the ship worthless.\n \nVerity was slowly working her way backwards through the ship, less interested in finding valuable items. Vertiy wasn't used to cutting ships apart for resale and didn't have a very good understanding of what is and isn't safe to cut through, unfortunately Verity start to cut through one of the many beams holding the wreck together, as she finished cutting through the final beam the whole wreck started to disintegrate she had mere seconds to leap from the wreck towards the wayfarer or risk being crushed by the mass of metal collapsing around her, as she leapt towards the ship one of the crew members, a rodian, grabbed her ankle and used her to pull himself forward and as a result drag her back towards the wreck which is now little more that a meat grinder, luckily verity had enough forward momentum to continue on her glide to the ship but he force of the rodain grabbing her put her off course, flying dangerously quickly towards the cockpit of the wayfarer, Verity quickly jammed on her emergency thrusters and managed to angle herself towards the cargo bay. After making a rough and very dangerou landing Verity stood up and brushed herself off only to be nearly knocked off her feet by a panicking Papalazarou rushing back in from his own disastrous salvage mission. \n\nEveryone got strapped in again as Leo turned the Wayfarer and headed back to Hapes, as he started his return journey he spotted something in the distance, an Imperial cruiser with the imperial customs insignia on the side. Not risking any of the crew being dragged in by imperial customs he quickly fired up the engines and sped for safer space. As Leo nimbly flew the rusted bucket towards the salvage yards landing pad all the crew including Verity and papalazarou had to talk about and look at was their pitiful bounty of scrap, knowing that even their valuable pieces included this job wasn't going to pay well enough to get off world Papalazarou and Verity decided to take a look at the local bounty board once they get off the ship and get paid. \n\nSoon after Leo skillfully lands the ship and reports to T'Loth who hands him a credit stick with his payment on, Leo thinks to himself \"500 credits is not worth flying that death trap to and from imperial patrolled space\" He pocketed the credit stick and turn to head towards the local cantina when he spots Verity and Papalazarou checking out the bounty board, originally Leo came to Hapes to track down a couple of lucrative bounties but they turned out ot be a bust and without enough money to get of world took up jobs s a pilot, see these two checking out the bounty board means he might be able to join up with them and go after bigger bounties and finally be free of this place.\nVerity turns to see Leo walking towards her, they exchanged pleasantries before deciding that there i really only one bounty on offer that pays well enough for all f them to share, a rodian named Borox, as his image loaded Verity realised she knew this guy, the rodain who tries to kill her before. \n\nTo be Continued.",

        "text": "To understand this story, you need to understand that Firestorm was a psychopath. Wicket knew this, but hadn't known when Firestorm found him in hiding months before to collect his bounty. But relationships change, and while the two of them began working together under the oversight of a morally-questionable jedi, Wicket started to realize that maybe a sane person doesn't change their name to Firestorm and have a body count in double digits at the age of 18. They worked well together none the less, bonding over their status as the party rogues, fanboying whenever their noble friend bought them a new invisibility clip.\n\nThe group had been trailing the ships for almost a week undetected. They didn't know where it was going, but they new who was on it: Avandris. When they found Avandris stuck on a trash planet only a month before, they thought they had found a new ally. She was a force user who didn't know her own strength and had the same vendetta they did against the shadowy science corporation Mobius. But letting her off the planet she was abandoned on was a mistake, as she quickly began terrorizing a local system with a group of already established terrorists. The group didn't know the motivations behind her actions, but they were sure ready to find out what she was up to and how she risen the ranks of the terrorist group so fast.\n\nThe group could finally land when Avandris' ship touched down on Arkanis at Al's space port. The group waited and landed a few spots away from her, greeting the original Al's grandson Al the Third upon arrival. Firestorm and Wicket immediately set off for the ship. Outside stood Avandris and a single guard, watching the open ramp. Avandris seemed to be waiting for something, but the two outlaws didn't want to start a scene and ruin Al's business, so instead they embarked inside.\n\nWicket went in first. The ship was small, only holding four rooms and a cockpit, but it seemed populated. While no one stood in the main hall, conversations could be heard in most rooms and the cockpit, with only one room seeming empty. Wicket opened the door and blindly ran into the dark room, closed the door and immediately turned on the light. He froze. He wasn't alone. A human guard slept in a cot against the wall, quietly breathing as Wicket stood in anticipation. He didn't wake up. Wicket carefully began walking around the room, looking for anything of interest: there were spare uniforms, shelves, more beds, not much to look at. The first thing on interest he found was the sleeping man's ID; looking him up on social media seemed to show he had quit his job and left his home planet two weeks ago. He had little friends and family, so no one seemed to notice.\n\n*Knock knock knock* Startled, Wicket looked up in horror as a knock on the door sounded through the room.\n\n\"Henry, get up! They're here.\" A voice shouted from outside. Wicket had no time to lose. He quickly ran to the closet cabinet, quietly through to the side any items taking up too much room and hid himself inside, just as Henry began to awake.\n\nOutside, Firestorm got a look at who \"they\" were. A group of men in suits and shades approached the ship, carrying an unmarked box. The guard called outside and a few men came of the ship to help retrieve the package. This was his que. He went somewhere quiet, turn on his invisibility suit and made his way back to the ship. He waited quietly and watched the guards carry the seemingly heavy box into the middle of the main hall. Finally, Avandris walked in behind them, closing the ship's ramp. Firestorm leaned against a door, avoiding touching anyone and watched in anticipation as they prepared to open it.\n\nBut all his hopes vanished as the door behind him slid open and the man inside rushed out before he had a chance to move. The rest of the ship watched in startling confusion as their companion bumped into seemingly nothing and fell to the ground. Avandris was quick on the draw and forced Firestorm into a wall.\n\n\"You can decloak. I can sense you anyways.\" Avandris waited until Firestorm turned off his invisibility cloak and then continued, \"Fancy meeting you here.\"\n\n\"Have we met?\" Firestorm quipped, \"Because the Avandris I know doesn't slaughter innocent trade ships.\n\n\"Oh that's cute, the ex-deathwatch member wants to talk morals. Strip him.\" The guards moved to Firestorm and began removing his weapons and utility belt. He knew there was no point in resisting, not with 5 guns on him and a force user pinning him against a wall.\n\nThey took everything from him but the clothes off his back. They didn't bother to take his jetpack, what would he use it for anyways? Avandris commanded a guard to take Firestorm into a room and watch him, and she commanded Henry to go retrieve the key to the box.\n\nMeanwhile, Wicket was still searching the room to no avail. Not much interesting but food and extra rounds.he knew there was something going on outside, but Firestorm could deal with it. All he needed to do was stay in this room and he was gold-\n\n*Click*\n\nThe light turns on and the door opens. In walks Henry, immediately taken aback at the sight of a strange furry creature in his bedroom. Wicket had to think fast.\n\n\"Buy gold.\" He said, immediately doing a backflip. \"No one will believe you.\" He activates his stealth clip, turning him invisible. Henry stood dumbfounded at what he just saw. Avandris stormed in, having heard the commotion.\n\n\"What's going on?\" She asked.\n\n\"Now, I know you're not gonna believe me, but-\" Avandris cuts of Henry before he can finish and raises a hand to the corner of the room.\n\n\"Do you idiots not realize I can sense you? Decloak now so you don't embarrass yourself.\" Wicket decloaked as the other guards rushed into the room, but he wasn't done just yet.\n\n\"Please mam, don't hurt me, I didn' do nuffin!\" He put on a childish voice in his classic bluff, praying to god she didn't remember him. \"I thought this was my parent's ship, so I boarded it without realizing, then I saw your guard, and-\"\n\n\"Save it, you idiotic furball. I should have known firestorm wasn't alone. Strip him.\" He was fucked.\n\nThey were both fucked. Firestorm stood against a wall, feeling naked without his equipment, as a bored guard held a blaster rifle to him from across the room. He had to do something.\n\n\"You know, for close range combat, I really prefer pistols. But that rifle's neat.\" He took a step towards the guard. The guard remained silent. \"So, what's in the box? I am actually dying to know. Is it a piece of the force harvester? Cause if so I would love to take a look.\" He took another step. \"Do you feel weak being commanded by a woman?\"\n\n\"Alright, bud now that's just sexi-\" **Woosh** Before he can even get out his words with a puff of smoke Firestorm starts his jetpack and soars across the room at him, quickly knocking the gun out of his hand and pinning him against the wall.\n\n\"Oldest trick in the book.\" He says coyly. But this guard isn't gonna let some asshole scoundrel walk all over him. He quickly slams his head against his opponent, connecting his helmet with his nose. Firestorm is knocked back and the guard dives for his gun. He picks it up off the ground and cocks it but just as he pulls the trigger Firestorm grabs him, causing the shot to sail past him into the wall behind him. Firestorm raises his fist and with one fist to the face, two fist to the face, and finally three fists square across the guard's jaw, he wrestles control of the rifle and places it square against the guards chest. Finally, the guard looks ready to surrender.\n\nOutside, a guard walks out of the cockpit, having informed the pilot to take off. To his left, Avandris and a few guards are surrounding another intruder. From the room where his best friend was watching the other, he hears a blaster shot. He rushes to the door, quickly opening it to see what the commotion is.\n\ninside, his best friend lays dead on the floor, and the prisoner stands above him triumphantly, holding his blaster right at the open door.\n\nThis blaster shot would have been heard by the whole ship, if Wicket hadn't had another bright idea. As the guards close in around him, ready to search him, he knew he couldn't just give up, and he wouldn't Because he has one more trick up his sleeve. Or, in his utility belt.\n\n\"He's got a grenade!\" The guards shout as Wicket pulls a flashbang out of his bag, struggling against Avandris' force grip. The guards take cover and Wicket presses a button on his hat. He's prepared for this. Just before the grenade blows right in front of his face, ear muffs and a visor lower to protect his vision and hearing. He payed good money for this, so it better work.\n\nA ringing goes out in the ears of all the guards. They cover their eyes and raise their guns. Avandris drops Wicket, but she's not fully out yet. She was fully in control of her senses, and a single flashbang wouldn't take her out immediately. But Wicket wasn't finished, and once dropped he pulled out his next trick: *another flashbang!* This time the room and no forewarning, and Avandris had no time to react and he threw directly at her. She was out. Now it was time for Wicket to move.\n\nHe quickly pulled out his duel pistol, Didn’' Do and Nuffin, and lifted his visor. As the guards cowered around him, he knew Avandris was the biggest threat. *Pew!* A well placed shot right in her shoulder. *Pew!* Another one to her arm. *Pew!* A shot to the leg and she's on the ground. Wicket knew she was still alive and conscious, but he couldn't bring himself to kill her. At least now she's be more willing to talk reasonably.\n\nHe slowly approached as she slowly began regaining her senses.\n\n\"Avandris?\" Finally, she looks up. And she is enraged. Before Wicket can react she forces him off the ground and slams him into a wall. He recoils in pain and drops his guns, but she's not done with him yet. She picks him up and starts choking the life out of him, watching his pained expression as the life is drained out of him. As the guards around her slowly start to wake up, they don't dare to move. She starts moving closer and closer to him, choking him tighter and tighter, until-\n\n\"Hey Avandris!\" She turns around. Firestorm stands at the door, smirk on his face. \"What do you say we air this place out?\" He holds up a grenade triumphantly in his hand. She drops Wicket, but it's too late. He removes the pin and throws it, to her and every guard in the room's surprise, not towards her, but right into the cockpit, closing the door behind it and running to cover.\n\n\"You suicidal piece of shi-\" **Boom** She has no time to talk as the front of her ship is torn to shreds, leaving a gaping hole in the front of the ship. The box is thrown out and everyone on board is thrown against the wall as the ship begins plummeting to the city. A liberal estimate would give them all thirty seconds.\n\nFirestorm activates his jetpacks and soars into the room, piloting downwards alongside the ship. Avandris would love to kill him right then and there but she has to escape. She uses all the force she can mediate on to surge and jump out the ship. firestorm grabs Wicket's lifeless body in his arms, praying he's not dead. But that's not his only priority. He knows one of these guards has his equipment and he's not leaving without it. He frantically begins searching for the guard until he sees an unconscious guard with a large bag marked contraband. That's the one. He grabs the two of them and maneuvers his way out of the ship. He can't pilot this thing for ever and they've got 24 seconds till impact.\n\nBut before all this, just about 2 minutes till impact, the ship took off, and those on board weren't the only ones to notice. Rodian fish smuggler turned pilot for Firestorm and Wicket's motley crew Illusk Drood noticed the ship took off and immediately took off in pursuit. And now, with some explosion probably caused by Firestorm taking the ship to the ground, he had to react fast. And when he ment fast, he meant fast. He pointed the ship at the ground and turned on every thruster he could, in a desperate attempt to catch whatever precious cargo fell from the ship, including, hopefully, Firestorm and Wicket. How would they catch them you ask?\n\nJaxx held on for dear life as the ramp to his ship opened to reveal the sky above them plummeting away. He could not let that box hit the ground, he **had** to know what was inside. Oh yeah, and he had to save Wicket and Firestorm too, but that's less important.\n\nFirestorm could barely hang on to the two of them, especially considering one of them was carrying all his guns and ammo. He desperately flew towards his ship, praying he could make it in time, but sadly today was not his day. Anvandris's ship was not alone. Two small fighters bearing the symbol of Avandris' group emerge from the clouds, shooting at Firestorm and his ship. He tried to evade them the best he could, but in his attempt to stay alive he dropped the guard and the bag he held in his hand, and it went soaring away from him. He had to get that bag, and in a moment tough choices he decided to throw Wicket's lifeless body toward his ship and fly off towards his bag.\n\nJaxx was having a hard time focussing on the box, considering he was in a ship with twenty seconds til impact that was being shot at. but it seems the force was on his side today as one of the fighters attempts to dive towards the ship and meets the front end of a missile, blowing it out of the sky. Another missile sails into the rubble of Avandris' ship, and a few more follow, some hitting, some missing, and some Illusk has to dodge. It seems the city below has measures to stop exploding ships from hitting the ground, and their system can't tell the difference between debris and terrorists fighting outlaws. Jaxx finally maneuvers the box into the ship right before noticing Wicket's lifeless body sailing aimlessly alongside the ship. He has 15 seconds till impact as he pull him back into the ship.\n\nFirestorm flies towards his bag but he just doesn't have the time. He has to have some other piece of equipment they didn't take off him he could use... Just as he considers giving up, he remembers! He has liquid cable attached to his suit. He sprays all he can at the bag and finally catches it, dragging it behind him like a dead weight. With his bag finally in his grip, he flies back into the ship, right beside Wicket's lifeless corpse.\n\n\"What the fuck is going!?\" Jaxx screams at him, quickly closing the ramp.\n\n\"You might want to buckle up!\" Is all Firestorm can think to say, and he's right. As the ship begins to approach the ground faster and faster, many of the ship can't handle the g-force pressing them all against the back of the ship. While Firestorm has grown slightly accustom to situations like this, the rest of the ship can't handle it, and with ten seconds to impact, Jaxx has already passed out against the back of the ship. As the ship draws closer to the ground, ever Firestorm can't handle it, and collapses as well, praying to God Illusk can handle himself. Which he can't.\n\nAt the front of the ship, Illusk can barely concentrate as he's pushed back in his seat.And as he begins to lose consciousness, there's only one hope left for the group... Saul. The group's' resident droid. With his thrusters on full, and a datapad showing the group's vitals in his hands, he begins his trek to save their lives.\n\n10...\n\nHe has to fly faster than the speeding ship to get to the cockpit. put all his energy into his thrusters, he blasts towards the front\n\n9...\n\nHe grabs an adrenaline needle that passes him out of the air\n\n8...\n\nHe reaches the cockpit\n\n7...\n\nHe rushes to Lusk's side\n\n6...\n\nHe lines up the needle to his neck\n\n5...\n\nHe stabs it right into a vessel, Illusk shoots awake\n\n4...\n\nIllusk cuts the boosters pulls up as hard he can. He has less than five seconds to make the greatest piloting maneuver of his life\n\n3...\n\nThe ship begins to level with the ground\n\n2...\n\nIllusk Slams on every thruster he can and pulls up as hard as he can and...\n\nThe ship rockets towards the stratosphere, as the remaining debris crashed to the city below. Illusk and Saul rejoice as the ship rockets upwards safely from harm. Illusk had never felt more alive.\n\n...\n\nOnce the ship was safely settled above the planet's atmosphere, Illusk checked the fuel levels. They didn't even have enough fuel to land back at the spaceport. He placed a call to the local towing company and went to the medical bay to see if their medical droid had survived the flight. Besides a few bumps and scratches, it was fine.The droid went around the ship and woke up the party, administering first aid where needed. After checking their rooms to see what was damaged, the crew all gathered in the dorms. They were bruised, confused, and knew the authorities would need to have quite the word with them when they landed back on Arkanis, but for now they didn't care about that.\n\nFor now, all they cared about was finding out how the flying fuck an amateur bounty hunter and an Ewok took down a ship full of armed guards and one of the most dangerous force users in the galaxy by themselves.",

I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThis is a continuation of '[Mutants and Masterminds] The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story part 13', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/54jziy/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/.\nPreviously, the calamitous conflict between superhumans came to a brief stop when Kitsune was slain by the cloned speedster White Dwarf. His death led to a surge of righteous fury from the allied forces. After soundly thrashing his murderous duplicate, Event Horizon found himself face-to-face with the spirit of Minato. The ghost instructed him to flee the ship and promised to hold Pinnacle of with the body of White Dwarf. Shifting between bodies took a toll on the spectral villain, forcing him to inhabit one of his own clones. Knowing that they would be overrun soon enough, Stonewall sacrificed himself so his compatriots could escape. The remaining resistance fighters agreed to separate in order to avoid detection; heroes and villains taking different ships. Pinnacle and his forces engaged the villains before they could escape, resulting in Pilot's death and then subsequent second life after Kitsune forced his spirit into the vampiric form of Lady Cold-heart. That is where we find ourselves now.\n\nNew York was a beehive of activity as dozens of fighter craft patrolled the skies amidst smouldering skyscrapers and hordes of Zel'tan warriors stalked the ruined streets. Survivors of the initial assault cowered behind closed doors, desperate to avoid the attention of their new overlords. Above it all, the daunting presence of a colossal capital ship loomed over the city. On the bridge of said vessel, a most peculiar sight was unfolding. \n\n\"Perhaps I had not made myself understood.\" Pinnacle's rich voice may have shown no sign of emotion but his actions spoke otherwise. His subordinates kneeled at his feet, each of them quivering in fear. They kept their heads bowed, if only to avoid being splattered with the thick tide of blood raining from above. A vortex of telekinetic energy howled over them, a miasma of Pinnacle's fury made manifest; at the centre of this psychokinetic storm hovered the ravaged remains of Stonewall. The mighty hero had long since fallen and now his earthly remnants were used as an example. Thick strips of flesh and muscle were slowly torn from the nigh-invulnerable corpse, adding to the shower of gore pouring over the prostrate henchmen. \"I instructed you to locate and recapture the renegades responsible for our recent set-back. That was exactly sixty one minutes and thirteen seconds ago yet I do not see the knaves in question before me. So let me reiterate.\" He smiled genially, pausing to inhale. \"Where the fuck are they!?\"\n\nAt the bottom of the Hudson River, a single Talon sat motionless save for the gentle rocking of the tides. It made for a tranquil image; The passengers aboard were a different story altogether. Emphatic gestures accompanied hushed growling as the misfits argued. \n\n\"You want to go back? You literally died last time and now you want to go back?\" Event Horizon whispered furiously, violently jabbing a finger into Minato's chest. The con-man glowered back, arms crossed across his chest.\n\n\"We have to. If we don't stop Pinnacle then no-one will. We need to gather our forces and make another assault on the capital ship now, when he's least expecting it.\" Event Horizon wind-milled wildly, his face clenched incredulously.\n\n\"He won't be expecting it because he kicked our asses!\" Event Horizon's incredulous shout was shushed immediately by Patterdemalion. The small imp shot his friend a pointed glare before turning his attention to the motionless form inhabiting the cock-pit. After hiding within the watery embrace of the Hudson, Pilot had stiffly informed them that they would need to be quiet in case Pinnacle had systems for scanning underwater. The newly undead woman stared vacantly into the depths before her. Patters gently patted her on one shoulder before landing silently and shuffling to his arguing compatriots. \n\n\"Event Horizon is quite correct. Even with some of the most powerful heroes of Earth by our side, we were unable to defeat Pinnacle. If we were to reattempt such a feat, I fear it would only end in our gruesome demise.\" With a quiet grunt of exertion, the demon scrambled up onto a vacant seat. \"Stonewall is dead, Pilot is traumatised and you yourself are barely capable of thought let alone conflict.\" He gestured at Minato with a wicked talon. The con-man growled feebly but Patters continued to speak quietly. \"We have few allies, little weaponry and a not insignificant foe to destroy. An assault now would gain us nothing and cost us everything.\" His crimson gaze remained firmly locked on Kitsune until the medium deflated with a sigh. Event Horizon let loose a breath of relief, plonking down into the chair across from them.\n\n\"I don't like it anymore than you do but I want to win the fight and be able to walk away.\" The speedster grimaced, rubbing his eyes tiredly. \"Why are we even talking about this? We're not the heroes, we don't do the pyrrhic victory bullshit.\" That earned a light chuckle from his friends before Minato spoke up.\n\n\"You said your brother was around here, right?\" Patterdemalion smiled viciously. \"Could he help us out?\" \n\n\"Almost certainly. He awaits us in the Museum of Fire.\" Even as quietly as it was whispered, there was a grandiose tone to the demon's speech. Minato and Event Horizon exchanged confused glances before a low, sultry voice rang out. \n\n\"He means the New York City Fire Museum.\" All eyes turned to the beautiful woman speaking. \"Created to commemorate and remember the Fire Department of New York, particularly those who gave their lives for others.\" Pilot regarded them coolly, with the air of a predator. Event Horizon found himself incapable of holding back the flirtatious grin that spread across his face. Ignoring the raunchy speedster, Pilot continued to speak. \"It's right nearby, so we should be able to make a break for it when the sun sets.\" She sunk further into the pilot's chair, ignoring the world around her. \n\n\"Okie dokie then.\" Event Horizon chirped mirthfully. \"So we pick your brother up, rendezvous with the Resistance and plan the next move?\" There were murmurs of assent from Minato before exhaustion took him. Event Horizon rolled his eyes good-naturedly before crossing his arms and getting comfortable. \"Not a bad idea. Could use some shut-eye after that disaster.\" Patters followed suit, curling into a tiny ball of leather and malice before falling asleep. Some hours passed before they collectively awakened with a start, a sharp hiss snaring their attention. A thick mist filled the cargo bay, cold enough that even Patterdemalion began to shiver. It hung eerily for a moment before coalescing into Pilot's new body. She moved with preternatural grace, slipping into the cock-pit with a growl. \n\n\"Bad news. Since I apparently don't sleep, I did some recon for us. The Resistance has been wiped out.\" The bleak statement eliminated any grogginess that might have remained. Event Horizon began to swear up a storm while Minato hissed through clenched teeth. Patterdemalion waved a hand, telekinetically quietening the speedster. \"Now we don't really have a choice. The longer we wait, the greater chance that Tatterdemalion will be apprehended. We cannot afford to lose another potential ally.\" As Pilot spoke, she was preparing the Talon for flight. \"If I keep this thing at the lowest possible power, we should be able to slip by Pinnacle's scanners undetected. The problem we'll have is that we're still a Talon flying against formation. We get spotted, we're fucked.\" Patterdemalion floated gently to his friend and perched on her shoulder.\n\n\"What can we do to assist you?\" Pilot glanced at the demon with hungry eyes. \n\n\"Get me someone to eat, make the ship invisible or kill Pinnacle. I'd be happy with any of those.\" There was some subdued laughter from the team but it died away quickly when Patterdemalion stroked his chin contemplatively.\n\n\"I have never performed such a feat in terms of mass or size though I suspect there is little alternative currently.\" He nodded, a determined gleam in his beady eyes. \"I shall place a veil upon our vessel, shielding it from sight.\" He looked around with a toothy smile. \n\n\"Time out.\" Event Horizon interjected. He stared down at the diminutive demon with curiosity. \"Are you telling me that you could have made us invisible at any time?\" When Patters grunted an affirmative, the speedster threw his hands in the air. \"Then why the fuck didn't we do that instead of parking under a goddamn river?\" Minato shushed him with a practised hiss. Patterdemalion smiled rakishly, a disturbing sight in and of itself.\n\n\"Is there anything else we can do for you, dear Pilot.\" The born-again vampire settled into the cock-pit chair, her demeanour taking on the razor-sharp focus that the villains were accustomed to.\n\n\"Sit down, strap in and pray to Satan.\" Rolling his eyes at the infernal faux pas, Patterdemalion slipped into Minato's lap moments before the medium had strapped in. Despite the absurdity of a demon perched on someone's knee like an unruly toddler, Event Horizon had no time to snark about it; the Talon rose smoothly through the Hudson with a quiet hum. Patters' eyes rolled back as he concentrated as his friends watched on nervously. Their faith, ironic as it may have been, was rewarded: Their flight to the New York City Fire Museum was uneventful in every way. The group breathed a collective sigh of relief as they landed gently beneath a grove of trees, their Talon largely concealed by the mottled leaves. Minato carried a weary Patterdemalion down the cargo ramp, following the imp's directions. Event Horizon and Pilot surveyed the area briefly before joining their comrades inside. \n\nIt was a jarring contrast between the nigh pristine exterior and the devastated interior: Scorch marks marred most of the surfaces, piles of ash and cinder strewn across the foyer. Furniture lay shattered and many exhibits had been cleaved in twain. At the centre of the carnage sat a smugly satisfied figure, slightly larger than Patterdemalion but far more muscular and devoid of wings. The violet-skinned imp was pacing languidly before he noticed their arrival. \n\n\"My new friends! Greetings to you all.\" He slunk over to them, his body morphing into that of a serpent. \"And my dear brother! What has happened to you, Patterdemalion?\" It was entirely troubling to hear genuine concern from the horrifying combination of snake and demon. While his friends stood staring dumbly, Patters smiled weakly at his brother.\n\n\"I am quite well, Tatterdemalion. It was simply a taxing journey and I require time to recuperate.\" The reptilian devil nodded sagely before smiling, it's grin stretching unnaturally wide to display fangs the size of daggers.\n\n\"Perhaps I have something to assist in your recovery, brother mine.\" A slimy tentacle emerged from Tatterdemalion's scaled body and gently wrapped around Minato's forearm. Of all the many unsettling things that he had seen recently, Kitsune could not help but feel that this was the worst. Nonetheless, he allowed himself to be led by the abomination from Hell's depths and the others followed. \"I present to you our nemesis and serial nuisance to the Director's plans: Angelus the Holy Avenger!\" His declaration was met with horror from the villains as they gazed down at the bound arch-angel. Chains burning with hell-fire secured her arms to her sides while her own radiant sword had been driven through her spine and into the cracked tile beneath. Despite the grotesque injury, the angelic being seemed unperturbed.\n\n\"You will regret this indignity, vile creature.\" She growled down at him. Event Horizon began to pace, emitting a high-pitched whine. \"I will...I will...\" Angelus' divine features scrunched up in confusion. \"What is that one doing?\" All attention turned to the speedster as he began to panic.\n\n\"First we piss of an army of alien invaders then it turns out they aren't aliens, they're just clones made by Pinnacle and then we piss him off and he wants to kill us and now we're going to piss off God because we kidnapped one of his angels and I swear that I just wanted to make enough money to open my own dance studio...\" They watched silently as he babbled more and more until Angelus cleared her throat violently. His entire body twisted towards her with an audible snap.\n\n\"Calm yourself, mortal. The Creator cares not for the squabbling between these pests and I.\" Angelus spoke with an aggrieved tone. \"We have hunted each other for millennia. This would not be the first time I have been felled by their claws, nor they beneath my blade.\" Her explanation seemed to sooth the anxious criminal. He nodded mutely before staggering over to a partially intact chair and flopping into it. \n\n\"True, true. But this is the first time that I have managed to contain you in such a way.\" Tatterdemalion crowed, changing once again. His diminutive frame expanded rapidly until his horned head grazed the ceiling, plaster and ceramic raining from above. \"I have defeated you, Avenger. Now I shall claim my prize.\" Tatterdemalion's voice boomed down at her. Minato furtively looked between demon and angel, trying desperately to figure out if that meant what he thought it did. Pilot stared blankly at the scene, her head cocked to one side. \n\n\"Very well, hellspawn. Do your worst.\" Despite her impalement and capture, Angelus' entire being radiated defiance. Her captor leaned forward, looming above the captive angel with sadistic glee. \n\n\"Fret not, my loathed foe. I have a much greater purpose for you than torture.\" One of his arms lengthened, taking on the texture of purple rubber. He sunk his claws into the fire engine and slowly pulled it towards him. The entire group, Patterdemalion included, watched silently as the massive truck screeched to a stop before Angelus. \"We have need of transportation, after all.\" The holy warrior blanched as she realised his intention.\n\n\"And what better way to travel than by angel?\"",

They walk to the bartender and ask him for a phone, so Guns can get into contact with Johnny Johnson, his connection, or his Johnson.\n\nPhilip: Howdy\n\nBartender: What is a couple of foreigners doing in this part of Warsaw?\n\nPhilip: Well uh, we got a little lost, can we get a phone?\n\nBartender: Sure you can, but only if you can do me a favor.\n\nPhilip turns to the group and they discuss whether or not they should.\n\nGuns: I think we should do it.\n\nPhilip: But they're skinheads.\n\nCosmic Saturn: Have we pissed them off yet?\n\nGroup: No.\n\nGuns: Alright we should accept it.\n\nGuns then hits the bar, staring at the bartender and proclaims \"Yes we can!\".

However Philip Guy just asks for a armband, which he gets, to the dismay of the rest of the group. \n\nAfter a while, the group makes it towards the train tracks, and finds the Indian shipping container. We attempt to talk about our approach but as the rest of the group talks, Philip walks up and knocks on the container. The container swings open and a Indian man with a shotgun answers and proclaims\n\nIndian Man: The shipment, is not a walker, its a 12-Gauge with your names on it, fascist pigs.\n\nOutside the game:\n\nGuns: Can I talk him out of shooting us?\n\nDM: No fuck you, Combat is Initiated.\n\n**Combat Initiated** \n\nGuns goes first, he runs behind a crate, aims his ALF 75 pistol and shoots at the Indian man, he gets a direct hit.\n\nFelipe the inquisitor goes second who pulls out two ALF 75's and blows the Indian man away with two critical shoots. the Indian man, according to the DM turns into a bloody mess, \"As if you got bloody mess in New Vegas\".\n\n**Combat has ended**\n\nBartender: Oh my god, you people just annihilated him.\n\nFelipe: That's what we do, we are the greatest group of mercs that has ever existed.\n\nFelipe fails the roll to convince the bartender that we are the best shadowrunners, and the bartender looks confused, and we just shrug and carry on inside the container.\n\nBartender: Here is our shipment!\n\nPhilip: Why did they hide it in a bunch of apple sauce crates?\n\nBartender: I thought you were \"Mercs\", you should know the first thing about smuggling\n\nPhilip: Shut up.\n\nGuns: Guys lets calm down, grab some apple sauce, and go back so we can call Johnson\n\nThe bartender pulls out a giant rocket launcher, he smiles as he holds it above his head, then a bullet flies in and hits the crate above Cosmic Saturn. Guns looks outside and sees 4 Indians with sniper rifles positioned on buildings above.\n\nIndians: Give up, we got you cornered!\n\nGuns: I may not have a rifle, but you sir have made a grave mistake!\n\nIndians: If you don't get out in 5 seconds we will shoot you!\n\nGuns: You better not!\n\nIndians: 5!\n\nGuns: Hey give us at least six seconds, I think you could \"savor our deaths\" if you give us six seconds.\n\nGuns convinces the Indians somehow with his dashing charisma and negotiation skills.\n\nBartender: Hey, maybe we can use that.\n\nIndians: 6\n\nThe bartender points at the giant crate, which Felipe opens where they find a giant walker, a heavily used one, but a walker without a doubt.\n\nPhilip: I used these in the war.\n\nGuns: These didn't exist until 2032, you were in the war in 2016.\n\nPhilip: Shut up you millennial.\n\nIndians: 5\n\nGuns: I was born in 2050, you're the millennial...millennial.\n\nIndians: 4\n\nPhilip brushes off Guns and pilots the Walker, which he has heavy experience in\n\nIndians: 3\n\nPhilip walks out of the container and points it at the Indians\n\nIndians: 2\n\nGuns walks out pointing his pistols at the other building\n\nIndians: 1\n\nGuns: How would you like it if I was on a higher building, and pointing guns at you?\n\nPhilip: Shut up.\n\nCosmic: Is this guy seriously our face?\n\nIndians: Fire!\n\n**To Be Continued**  ",

        "text": "We're super heroes! Kinda. \n\nWe were new to the whole superhero schtick. All first level metahumans, recently teamed up to fight crime; all optimism and roses. Well, some of us were more rose-like than others. Although I wasn't a moody teen or anything, I had some nifty shadow-based abilities that gave me an intimidating darker look.\n\nOut on our first night patrol (on the rooftops of course!) and our police scanner (we were so poor) squawks about an alarm going off at the local bank. A nighttime robbery! We race to the scene. Some faster than others since I was the only one who could fly; accurately anyway.\n\nWe get there and observe from a rooftop across the street. The place is already surrounded by police by the time we all gather. The police scanner tells us that the robbers have a hostage; a night security guard surprised them and set off the alarm before they overpowered him and used him to keep the city police at bay.\n\nWe come up with a plan.\n\nSince I can fly, I quietly move the other characters to the roof of the bank (no police helicopters at this time) one by one and locate a roof access once we're there.  In shadow form, I slip through the crack under the door and open it from the inside. We can hear the muffled voices of panicked robbers down below.\n\nMiraculously making our crappy Prowl checks, we sneak below and check out the situation. There are three robbers. Perfect, there are three of us! Two guys are hanging back, out of sight from the front doors so the police can't see them. The apparent leader is up near the doors, using one arm to hold up the unconscious guard to show the police he's the Big Man in Control. He's making all kinds of demands while we hang back behind them all and plan our heroics.\n\n Here's our nooby nooby plan: Stretchy Guy and Lightning Guy will get behind the two henchman robbers. I'll go full shadow form and, using my flight speed, zoom up in front of the Big Man in Control and negotiate the guards release, hoping my Horror Factor from my form shocks the BMC into giving me an edge with intimidation.\n\nWe do it.\n\nThe Henchmen are armed with guns, but my Horror Factor affects them since they were facing my way and they fail their saving throws horribly.  BMC, on the other hand, is unimpressed by my appearance which, although a scary(ish) shadow creature, is relatively slight of stature.\n\n(paraphrasing)\n\nBMC: \"Ohhhh, we have some heroes here to save the day!\"\n\nMe: \"Release the guard and give yourselves up. We have you and your men surrounded. There's nowhere to go and you can't escape us.\"\n\n*My compatriots pop out to prove my words*\n\n*The henchmen, although startled, are disciplined and don't panic, but simply follow the lead of the BMC*\n\nBMC: *lightly tosses the guard aside and smirks at me*\n\nMe: (In my best hero voice) \"Did you really think you would get away with this?\"\n\nBMC: (rolls for initiative in reply and beats us all!) **Sucker punches me with a Natural 20 and knocks me out cold from his Boxing skill with meta-enhanced strength!**\n\nI drop like a stone, snoring on the cool tiles of the bank, as my friends attempt to recover from the shocking turn of events. Without me, the BMC and the henchmen turn the tide and affect an escape up through *our* rooftop access!  Up on the roof, the BMC uses his Extraordinary Strength to hurl his two henchmen to the roof of next building over and fully escape the situation from there.\n\nMy friends can only gather my limp form from the floor and exit through the roof themselves, leaving the police an empty bank.

        "text": "Decided to take a break from GMing and convinced a friend to run a one-shot game of Urban Arcana. I'm playing my most Mary Sue-esque character, a half-silver-dragon Strong hero whose built up the unarmed combat/martial arts/streetfighting feat chains, so a punch does more damage than a Desert Eagle shot.\n\nShadowrun-esque cyberpunk setting, my guy runs a nightclub. Fairly normal night until android-ninjas burst in. Bit of combat, end up trading hits with the leader, a rakshasa. He's babbling about how his boss wants to purge the city of the half-bloods. Okay, whatever, have a blast of paralysing gas in your stupid tiger-demon face.\n\nThings are going in my favour, I'm about to land the final hit on the rakshasha. He holds up his freaky-backwards hand as if to cast a spell, but the GM says nothing happens. Okay, fine, I guess? Maybe he just fluffed the roll (he was old-school and rolled behind a screen).\n\nThe rakshasa and few surviving ninjas switch on cloaking devices and run for it. Obviously I want some answers, so I go to my shadowjack contact who tries to find some information on who may have sent them. \n\nThe information leads to a crime syndicate hideout down at the docks, where I easily mop up the human thugs there. I return to my shadowjack friend, and find that he's been brutally murdered. The police storm in then, find me at the scene of the crime, and arrest me.\n\nWe RP through the grinding weeks of interrogation and incarceration. No one will listen to me. I suspect the rakshasha's boss is behind this, paying off the police. There's a trial, and I get multiple lifetime sentences for the shadowjack's murder and a bunch of other falsified charges. I'm transported to a hyper-max prison.\n\nAll the while I'm thinking \"where is this going?\"\n\nBeen at the prison for a few days. One day I'm in the yard, and the guards suddenly disappear, and I get surrounded by a gang, probably paid by the crime boss to kill me in prison. So here we go... combat starts. I get some hits in, but one of the gang shivs me.\n\n\"30 damage,\" says the GM. \n\nThat's way too much. I ask him if that was a crit, if the thugs have feats or special abilities or something; I'm expecting cybernetics, demonic powers, anything. He doesn't say. \n\nCombat continues, and I get hit again.\n\n\"80 damage.\"\n\nAgain, I ask wtf. He doesn't say. Feeling pretty salty now.\n\nGet hit again.\n\n\"700 damage\". \n\nWell dude, obviously now I'm dead. More that dead, I'm chunky salsa, seeing as 700 damage is nearly quadruple my maximum HP. I'm pissed, I basically call him out and say that if he didn't want to GM he could've just said rather than string me along for a few hours and pull this \"hurr rocks fall everyone dies\" crap...\n\nBut then he says as I lie dying there in the yard, my vision starts to swim and blur, and when I can see again, I'm back in the club, back to that moment months ago, and the rakshasha has just started to run away after blasting me with some illusion magic; that spell that I was told \"did nothing\". \n\nGM put me through a depressing hallucination/dream sequence/spiralling descent into despair just to cover the bad guy's escape. The ludicrously increased damage represented the breakdown of the illusion as it became increasingly unstable and unbelievable, and my character's mind starting to return to reality.\n\nGenius.\n\nAnd the adventure continued from there. It ended with me storming the syndicate headquarters and going down swinging against a \"pureblood\" red dragon crime boss, but that whole dream sequence thing was the highlight of the whole night.\n\n\n(edited for spelling and to expand on some details).\n\n ",

        "text": "Hello Ladies and Gents,\n\nFirst before I say anything, I want to say how damn lucky I am that I have the players I do in my Vampire the Masquerade \"Twin Cities by Night\" game. They are friggin awesome, and I am so thankful to have them.\n\nWhen I first decided to dust of Vampire the Masquerade after 15 years of no role playing what so ever, and run a game near to my heart I was friggin nervous, especially because I only knew personally one of the players.\n\nI wanted to do it on Google Hangouts, and once I heard that it could record to Youtube I wanted to do that just so I could have an archive along with the players in case we wanted to go back an watch.\n\nTo me, I think storytelling take some courage because it could blow up in your face (that's part of the reason I created the OWod and CoD Game Play Facebook Page, for the people who have overcame the fear and actually took steps to share it with the world). I almost gave up on Youtube when I couldn't figure one thing out but we ended up getting it to work. I decided, albeit nervously, to share the videos online to get feed back (with the okay from the players who wanted feedback too, because we look at the game as all 5 of us telling a story).\n\nWell now we are 10 sessions in, and surprisingly have people who watch the videos, and some who give us feedback. I am so appreciative of all of you who do watch and take your time. One of our players has mentioned numerous times that some people may be off put by the task of having listening to 3 hours of game play. So he had an awesome idea, to break down the sessions of game play into scenes so it is easier to ingest by viewers. Along with that he created our new intro too.\n\nSo without further ado, here is our very first game session in our first storyarc \"Negligence\", where 4 Kindred who have spent the first 20 years of their undead existence secluded, are now thrust together to complete a task for the Kindred leadership of the Twin Cities of Minnesota. \n\nBTW I was nervous as hell through out the session, to where I couldn't pronounce a player name right no matter how hard I tried lol.\n\nPlease subscribe, like the videos, and comment if you enjoy!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlI7udTBmjbGu7Xx4YRj1yPWhDAWbFV-0\n",

        "text": "(Preface)\n\nThe last few weeks I've been running Ocean's Eleven style heists with my Pathfinder players. They've beaten me at every turn, but this takes the cake. \n\n(Story)\n\nAs usual, our opening scene is on the Face of the group, who goes by Redford on jobs. Redford owns a nice store, no longer selling cons but truly nice items as his store has gained fame over the last few months. He has taken a teenage dragon on as a houseguest, and one of his best employees is a ferret familiar names Georgie. They have klava a lot.\n\nThen we go to the party's information-gathering Sylph of shadows, the one who goes by Bluefoot and is a master of disguise. Over the last few heists, she formed a secret information-gathering group akin to the Infinite Consortium crossed with the Library from Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nShe learns from her (percentile 99) rolls that the Council (the previous government of the city that the PCs indirectly led into civil war) are having final peace talks at the Elf council member's casino in three days. Other information she learned:\n\nSome of the Council has hired Assassins to take the group down\n\nThe Dwarf council member is planning on selling the city to the neighboring dwarf kingdom\n\nRedford likes to get Gyros with Georgie on Tuesdays. This was super important to learn.\n\nNow, bring in the final member of the party, the thief. A Sabateur of the highest order, the infiltrator who goes by Trigger. He has, in the last few sessions:\n\nDeposed on of the Council members (the Goblin mob boss named Mizzix)\n\nTaken over as Goblin Boss\n\nDeclared himself Councilman\n\nStolen from a temple\n\nMade an alliance with three of the council members\n\nBasically said to the others \"if you don't do what I say, I will kill you, or you can leave.\"\n\nThe others are not a fan.\n\nSo, Trigger is a part of the upcoming peace talk, so he's prepared to pull a final heist at the casino to send a message. Bluefoot goes to gather information on the Elf council member, She-of-Stars. I call for Redford to join me outside.\n\nI offer him, on behalf of the Council members not aligned with trigger, all the goddamn gold and power to betray Trigger and get him alone outside. He agrees to this, on the condition that it happens after the peace talks and that if the regular police get involved to let Trigger be arrested instead. They agree and leave. We go back inside.\n\nBluefoot has learned that She-of-Stars has been having an affair with a human servant, and that they had a secret baby. She even uses a body double to distract her husband all the time. She also has her real manor hidden below the casino, the one on the surface is for security reasons.\n\nThe party then gives the husband proof of the cheating, and he agrees to help them out. Trigger meets with his allies to discuss terms and conditions. They send out a message to every NPC who's helped them out before, and everyone who owes them a favor. Then, I am asked to step outside so they can plan the heist. (That's what we do each week, to give it a different and fun feel.)\n\nAfter spending enough time outside our game store to have a smoke break and hold a conversation, I am called back in. It's go time. \n\nThe \"heist\", as it was, didn't require any rolls. The husband simply led them to the treasure vault and helped them load up bags of holding. They wait a bit, and the peace talks are set to begin. During the peace talks, the casino is operating at peak efficiency. Folks from all over the city are dressed in their finest, spending money. As soon as the door to the peace talks close, the party hands out all of the loot yet just stole to people on their way out the door. \n\nDuring the peace talks, Trigger reveals the Dwarf's treachery, and she is scheduled for execution. The Halfling takes the hint and leaves the city. The human and the elf are the only ones left who oppose trigger. Wizard angrily leaves to prepare, and the elf goes back to her casino to find it emptying out and treasure being given to commoners. As she starts to freak out, she notices her secret half elf daughter handing out the treasure, with the dragon behind the daughter pantomiming eating her.\n\nThe husband, by the way, has the servant's dick cut off, handing it to his wife to say \"fuck yourself.\"\n\nNow, here's where I lost. I had my assassins ready to go, but Trigger steps outside. Since Redford was on my side, I didn't question him playing the chief of police, and I didn't question Trigger getting arrested with no struggle.\n\nThey let everyone know exactly where Trigger is being held. The assassins go to the prison and break into Trigger's cell. A trap goes off, lowering their ability to roll good will saves, and Trigger disappears. The door swings shut and the assassins are killed by a series of nine traps. Their bodies are magically altered to resemble Trigger and Bluefoot.\n\nMy players reveal that they had this planned for a few days at least. They disguised Redford as the Chief of police. The Redford at the casino was one of their allies in disguise.\n\nTrigger was a magical clone inside the prison.\n\nBluefoot was invisible to ensure nothing went wrong.\n\nTrigger became cleared of his crimes, since the \"real\" criminal was dead, and he became the King of Fellstar, with his own council he hand picked.\n\nBluefoot's secret library of spies spread to other countries, and she became the king's spymaster \n\nRedford was happy enough just keeping his shop open, but in the years to come, he would gather up a group of thieves just like when this whole campaign started, and he set off to pull off the heist of a lifetime across the silver sea.",

        "text": "So, my buddy's birthday was a little bit ago, but we just got together to celebrate last weekend, and another of our friends decided to run a stupid and silly one-shot (he does these quite frequently and they are an absolute blast). This is a story of one of the stupid and ridiculously fun things that happened.\n\nMy barbarian's name was Byrg, he was a human, level 10, and a totem warrior of the bear. \n\nI'm going to skip through quite a bit of exposition, as it was mainly a lot of encounters that were combat related, and happened pretty quickly. \n\nEssentially, the forest we started in had been corrupted, and we were searching for the cause. \n\nBesides Byrg, we had a Moon Druid, Hunter Ranger, and a Two-Weapon Fighter. \n\nAfter making our way through the forest, we finally made it to the center. We found a 200 ft tall tree, completely corrupted, and surging with blight. Picture the Great Deku Tree from Zelda (Ocarina of Time) but dark and corrupted. Byrg was able to get to the top with a LOT of climbing checks, and once he made it, found a nest with two HUGE eggs. Obviously, the first thing to do is throw one off the edge. After which, Byrg was ambushed by a blight, and knocked off. \n\nFortunately, the Druid was an earth elemental, and caught me. The DM had me roll 19d6 damage from falling, and I was raging, so I took half. 206 HP - 33 (66/2). He made it back up, and right before grabbing another egg, made a perception check. \n\nNat 1... \n\nByrg was grappled by a roc, that came out of nowhere, and was carried off. \n\nAll he remembered after that was being impaled by a tree. 106 HP. His companions, rushed to where he was, but the elemental Druid and the fighter had other plans. The roc, was carrying the tree with Byrg stuck through it (DM was sending some serious bullshit, but we were all having fun), and then got impaled by a tree of its own.\n\nThe great bird of prey crashed to the ground. Byrg was underneath it. We rolled every die on the table. In order to kill him, with his resistance, DM had to roll I think over 600 damage. He ended up getting lucky with some percentiles and got 700+.\n\nAs his companions rushed to the crater, they noticed the barbarian's middle finger, sticking out underneath the roc, with the words \"The DM\" written on it. \n\nBest player death I've ever experienced. Thank you for reading this monster of text, but I thought I'd share. Happy gaming to all, and let me know what you thought! :D",

        "text": "Last story: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/557z7x/the_gang_accidentally_becomes_terrorists_sr_5ae/\n\nHello again! You guys seemed to like my first tale of this insane campaign I'm in, so I decided to write about session two. In case you haven't read my first story, here's the cast again: \n\nFleur- deaf French socialite and B&amp;amp;E specialist. \n\nDahzdbog- Czech native face and driver. All natural, no augs. Sadly, wasn't here for this run.\n\nLedo- Czech native, decker and a bit of a face. (As a side note, her and Dahz were foster siblings before they fell out of contact a few years back- they figured it out in some between session RP.) \n\nToast Blindfire (I know)- the heavily augged street sam, modelled after Adam Jensen. \n\nQuick prologue- in between sessions, we'd had a bit of random stuff like solo runs happening, and pretty much everything in the session changed when Fleur got attacked by a recurring antagonist and got picked up by paramedics. When her biomonitor alerted them, it also alerted the evil stepmom- who wants Fleur killed, since Fleur is the last piece of evidence of a particularly hostile takeover of a Corp. She escaped the hospital before the stepmom arrived, and we had to escape Prague. We thought of a few ways to conceal her as we exited, then she got bored and wanted to try something. One escape artist roll later, she folded up and got in a duffel bag, allowing us to leave the city successfully.\n\nSo, this session was a bit of an oddity. We open on the three members of the group that were here chilling in Dahz's van, planning theor next move, when the radio goes off. \"Urban Brawl fight, in &amp;lt;Prague Suburb&amp;gt;, this night! On radio and trid display! Apply now for a chance to win and go to the tournaments!\" Naturally, Toast and Fleur apply within minutes. We then drive down to the converted warehouse where the fights are taking place and start looking into it further.\n\n(For those unaware, Urban Brawl is kind of like a mix of gladiatorial combat and WWE. It's supposed to be fists only, and to the death or KO depending on the league. However, it's pretty much an unspoken rule that you're allowed to smuggle in whatever extra gear you can hide when you enter the cage.)\n\nAnyway, Ledo has been writing a virus the past few in-game days, and wants to try it. While the fighters go form identities and get prepped, Ledo starts talking to rich people and trying to get their commlinks to upload the virus. Nothing really happens here yet, so we cut back to the fighters. Fleur has chosen \"The Mysterious Bag\" as her persona, playing off her gimmick of fitting inside duffel bags. Toast has chosen \"Pastry Chef,\" increasing the silliness of his character by a factor of 50. His reasoning is from something about a nickname an NPC has for him, Toaster Strudel. \n\nSo the first fight begins. Its Fleur against a horribly optimized character the GM played once, a long time ago, named Princess. The fight is over pretty quickly. Then the second fight. We gloss over it, mostly, since we have a full bracket and it's just two NPCs this round. However, this round is particularly violent- triggering a flashback to the Aug Incident for Ledo. She has to leave her post to go curl up in a ball and cry. The weaker NPC in this fight gets killed quickly, and before a fight between Toast and some unmemorable NPC, Ledo asks for the commlink of the dead guy. It's brought out and she starts uploading a virus, trying to get her name out there as an established hacker. This being done successfully, we move on to the second fight.\n\nThere isn't that much to say. The guy gets destroyed by our street sam, as should be expected, and we get some cool loot from his locker. We'll skip the other boring rounds, and we make it to the semi-finals, when suddenly: SURPRISE UPSET! The GM says that a new fighter enters the arena and comes over for a fight. We're confident, until we realize something:\n\nThis isn't just any fighter. This is the min-maxed bullshit our GM threw at us before. This is the guy that nearly killed Fleur. It's clear this fight won't just be a typical round of Urban Brawl.\n\nWe kick off the round, and after I convinced Fleur that winners do drugs, she takes a hit of Jazz to match the initiative of this guy. Ledo risks the PTSD triggers to step in on the cameras to give assisting rolls with her tactics knowledge. But the bad guy goes first. Realizing who he's against, and being one of the most vengeful people I've seen, he pulls his katanas and charges straight for Fleur. Fleur decides to make a block roll- taking no damage on a tie or 1 above his roll, or dealing damage to him if she gets 2 net hits or higher than he got on his attack (IIRC, this is because of the shock frills on her armor.) She subtracts 5 from her initiative, and rolls to block. We all sit in suspense as the dice are rolled...\n\n1 hit lower than him. Everyone sighs, prepared for her to get hospitalized again, until we remember something- Fleur has one point of edge left. She's able to reroll all the dice that weren't successes. Another roll, and we're all holding our breath in suspense...\n\n3 hits. Meaning that the block is made, *and* he takes stun damage. Cue sigh of relief from everyone. Then it's Ledo's turn. She rolls her tactics, then Fleur goes next with a follow-up swing.  Ledo drops out from her PTSD. But it doesn't matter. We have, through the power of min-maxing, beaten our min-maxing GM at her own game. \n\nHer hit is followed by a hit from Toast's jacked cyberarms, and he's pretty much down. At this point, Fleur grabs a gun from Toast and gives a monologue before killing our enemy- of course, being deaf-mute, this is all in a private DNI call. Unless you want them later, I'll spare the details. Basically just screaming at him for a minute or two, then she kills him. \n\nLedo runs in a minute later and sees the aftermath. She decides to make a story out of this so Fleur isn't investigated as more than a brutal UB fighter, considering how bad this got. Ledoborec got up and rolled con, then made up a story. Again, I'll spare the details, but it was essentially just spinning the story a years long rivalry where Fleur always took the high road and the dead guy, well.. Didn't. The crowd ate it up.\n\nAt this point, we decided to leave it there and finish up the final round the next day. I couldn't make that one, unfortunately, but it ended with the NPC from the second fight versus Fleur. Somehow, Fleur won- meaning that after our next run, she'll be invited to another tournament in Austria. Due to killing the (what we thought would be recurring) antagonist, Toast was also invited. With Ledo solidified as their manager, we decided that would be our next move after we went on another run- both of which I'll be sure to transcribe here if you want to hear it! (And beware- it'll only get crazier from here.)\n\n(sorry for the formatting of its bad, on my phone again for this one.)",

        "text": "So, I was DMing a homebrew Weird West setting, heavily inspired by FFG's old Open20 Spellslinger rule set; there's some magic, but not too much. There are elves, but they're the isolated, in-hiding Native American equivalent. \n\nWe'd been playing for a few months, and having a great time. The story has organically grown into a conspiracy plot where the group is trying to foil an Illuminanti-esque demon-worshipping cult called The Quiet Brothers. Our cast is a nimble, smooth-talking conman, a surly ex-military gunfighter (both brothers), and Father Jebediah Underwood, an old grumpy preacher. Jeb's special, as he's an Apostle; someone randomly chosen and blessed with divine powers by THE LAWWRD to heal, banish demons, etc. He's got a glowy eye (inspired by the brands from Spellslinger), and his player has a secret plan that came to glorious fruition, but that's a story for another time.\n\nRight, fluff over. Actual story time.\n\nSo the group has recently returned to civilisation after hanging out with the elves for a few weeks (Jeb's an old friend), and we're approaching the endgame and the big climatic battle where they'll stop the Quiet Brothers from completing a giant ritual that'll unleash hordes of demons across the country. They get into the capital city, and they decide they need to relax, rest, and have a good time before the imminent violence.\n\nJeb knows the mistress of the city's most high-class burlesque house, the Velvet Birdcage, and they go there. The mistress is happy to see Jeb, and she gets her best girls to show the group a good time; the conman starts making sweet-talk with the girls, the gunslinger enjoys some quality brandy, and Jeb plays the piano (his player had always taken every opportunity to play the piano in saloons and had hilariously always rolled 18 or higher, and I'd said Jeb had actually started to get a reputation as a bit of celebrity; after all, he's a piano-playing preacher with a glowy God-eye). \n\nAll's going well, when there's a disturbance at the front door, and in walks the BBG's lieutenant, who's the leader of a large outlaw gang. He's just muscle, he doesn't have a Quiet Brothers membership card. He is however an Apostle himself and has similar powers to Jeb (nothing about being an Apostle says you have to be a good person!), and he's with some of his cronies; some regular thugs, and a huge Mrs. Trunchbull-esque woman (the sister of a similarly huge thug boss the group had dealt with in a previous session). \n\nNow, the outlaw leader has given the group trouble before, and is the nemesis of the conman and the gunslinger brothers (he killed their parents and burned down the family home). They've tussled with him before, and fended him off, and he's not happy about it. \n\nWhile the burlesque girls start to appease the outlaw leader and his gang, the group hide in a private room before they're seen. Inevitably, assassination is discussed. But how? The outlaw leader's really tough, and he's not alone. The gunslinger is all for storming out there, guns blazing and to hell with the bystanders (his player has a history of running characters who are generally unconcerned about collateral damage), but the conman and Jeb want to play it smart and subtle. \n\nA plan is hatched; get the outlaw leader's gang away from him, stealth-kill them off one by one, then spring an ambush on him. A solid plan, but the Dice Gods, the cruel and fickle Polyhedronae, would have other ideas...\n\nJeb asks the mistress to send a few of her girls to take the outlaw leader up to a private room and \"distract\" him. She's not happy about it, but reluctantly agrees. Turns out the outlaw leader is ahead of them, as he's already dragged one of the burlesque girls upstairs. The conman, the chivalrous ladies man, wants to try and save her, but Jeb stops him and they go ahead with their plan. \n\nMrs. Trunchbull hasn't actually seen the two brothers herself, so the gunslinger draws her away, claiming to be a friend of her dead brother and offering condolences. Jeb can't risk approaching the other thugs because he's way too recognisable, so it falls to the conman. Naturally, the conman is quite the cardsharp and there's a poker game going, and after he makes a big act of being drunk off his arse and dropping a serious amount of cash on the table, the two thugs join in, sensing easy pickings. Jeb just lurks around, ready to pitch in if things go south. So far, so good.\n\n(In retrospect, I'm not sure why they didn't just burst in on the outlaw leader while he \"busy\" upstairs and just put a bullet in his brain, but hey-ho. My group likes overcomplicating things).  \n\nThe conman starts to play the two thugs, and begins to turn them against each other; if one wins the hand he hints they might be cheating, stuff like that. It eventually erupts into a brawl between them, and the bouncers are quick to throw them out, so that's them taken care of. \n\nMrs. Trunchbull sees what's happening, and goes outside to chew out the two thugs, and the gunslinger follows her. And this is where the tight plan starts to unravel. \n\nSo after spending time earning Mrs. Trunchbull's trust, what does the gunslinger's player do? Pull a gun on her? Nope, he just kicks her in the crotch. So, minimal damage, I make a saving throw for her so that she doesn't fall prone, and then the gunslinger panics and runs away down the street. The rest of us are just baffled but the gunslinger's player is adamant that it was the best plan, even though it's had the exact polar opposite result. Mrs. Trunchbull (whose now just really, really confused with what just happened) goes back inside for another drink. The conman then tries to get rid of her, but she's having none of it. After a short while, she just leaves. Anticlimatic perhaps, but I guess it's a success?\n\nSo with the goons out of the way they can prepare to take down the outlaw leader (the gunslinger came back), and this is when the plan starts going seriously off-page. There's a dance stage with a trapdoor, and the players are dead set on getting the outlaw leader onto that trapdoor and dropping him through, so they concoct a plan of putting together a huge show, again as a distraction, and hope the outlaw leader will get on the stage? I'm dubious of the plan (I don't flat out say \"it won't work\" but man, I am heavily implying it), but they won't hear of it. \n\nThey spend a while getting all the girls together, the band, everything, for a big song-and-dance number. The conman and the gunslinger hide behind the stage curtain and will ambush the outlaw leader and push him into the trapdoor. Jeb's just like \"eh, I guess I'll do my part and play the piano.\"\n\nAs I said, Jeb's become a bit of a celebrity due to his fine piano playing skill (think he had something like +12 on his roll due to proficiency bonus, feats, and high stats). Rolls, natural 20, amazing performance, the best of his life. Dude’s a freaking artist with the ivory. We all have a laugh about it, and someone jokes that what if his performance is *too* good? \n\nYES. Rolling with it.\n\nUpstairs, the outlaw leader hears the piano music, and grabs his clothes and volcano gun. “UNDERWOOD!!!”\n\nHe rushes out, earlier than expected. He and Jeb talk some smack about foiling one another’s plans, yadda yadda. Roll for initiative, outlaw leader starts taking pot-shots with his handcannon. The staff and patrons of the burlesque house panic and run.\n\nThe plan’s gone up in smoke, but behind the curtain, the conman and gunfighter are ready to launch the perfect ambush. Like I said, the conman is quite nimble and had recently picked up a magic revolver and was eager to give it a shot. He wants to get higher, find a good vantage point. \n\n“Are there lighting rigs or gantries or something?”\n\nSure, why not?\n“Well, are there some ropes or something backstage I can use to climb up?”\n\nAbsolutely, roll!\n\nMeanwhile, the outlaw leader stomps onto the stage, roaring “WHERE ARE THOSE DAMN DWYTE BROTHERS!?”\n\nConman’s player rolls.\n\nNatural 1.\n\nHe pulls the wrong rope, and the curtains pull back to reveal him and his brother, completely unprepared. \n\nThe whole plan is now non-existent, and the situation dissolves into a messy three-on-one gunfight which results in Jeb and the conman being seriously injured and three patrons killed. \n\nThe outlaw leader, bloodied but alive, escapes, and before the group can give chase, that’s where the sheriff and militia arrive... \n",

        "text": "\nThe following is a short story I wrote because my character, Raphe D’Uvamore, Cleric of Cayden, met an unfortunate turn of events and became a human arrow holder. Not wanting the story to die there my GM, Josh, gave me two chances. One was a mysterious figure that offered Raphe his life if he would take care of a little problem, kill a child before it could grow up an cause this being trouble.\n\nI could not do that, especially not as a Priest of Cayden.\n\nThe second chance was to write out a plea to Cayden as to why he should be sent back. I decided to go one better and wrote the following short story.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nIn The Afterlife\n\nSo this is what it’s like to be dead?\n\nHow long has it been? It feels like days.\n\nThe empty bar of the First Temple, affectionately known as Cayden’s Place, stretched out in front of Raphe. It was quiet, not even the ghostly bartender could be seen. A diffused dim light filled the bar making it impossible to tell if it was day or night. To Raphe it was quieter than he had ever experienced.\n\nAfter the Visitor left Raphe waited patiently for Cayden to show up to congratulate him for passing the test. Ale after ale Raphe savored as he waited. He placed his empty stein on the counter and as soon as he looked away it was filled again. After his fourth ale he noticed that he really could not feel the effects of the intoxicant, after his eighth he accepted he never would again. After his tenth he accepted that Cayden wasn’t coming. After his twentieth he started to panic.\n\nIt is an odd thing to consume twenty ales and not feel inebriated, nor full, nor have any urge to relieve yourself. In fact, Raphe felt no biological urges at all. It was all very disconcerting. The ale was refreshing and tasty, the pretzels were salty and had a satisfying crunch, the temperature was perfect, but it was quiet. There were no sounds of revelry, no friends chatting in a corner, no songs being sung, no glasses clinking, no wenches running from table to table. It may look like the First Temple, but this is not a place to worship Cayden. It was way too solemn.\n\nAm I in Hel? Raphe said to himself. He then looked around. Shrugged his shoulders and shouted.\n\n“Am I in Hel!”\n\nThe sound of his voice shattered the silence but only for a moment. He would have welcomed even the chirp crickets as a response at that moment.\n\n“Hellooooooooooooooooooo!”\n\nSilence.\n\nWell, Cayden does help those who help themselves. Maybe I’m just supposed to walk out of here.\n\nWith purpose Raphe got up from his stool, turned, and walked to the door. Not even taking a moment to look before he leapt. He opened the door and walked into the darkness… Only to arrive back in the bar on the other side.\n\n“There goes that Idea.” He announced to the silence.\n\nAfter a few more attempts he resigned himself to the fact that he is trapped.\n\n“Well, what now?”\n\nRaphe already knew the bar in detail, as every priest of Cayden serves at least one year in “Seminary” as a bartender. (Many people would be surprised at how much one learns of people doing so. Most people confide in either a Priest or Bartender when they need guidance or release, and they are ultimately more willing to confide in a Priest that is also a Bartender.) Even though he knew the bar, he took his time to examine every part of it. Finding that every exit he used just dumped him back in through  another one. All the taps were exactly where they should be, every mug exactly where Brewmaster Bosin would require it of the Acolytes, every counter clean, every chair perfectly aligned. Nothing was missing. Nothing was added.\n\n“What now? What do you want me to do?”\n\nSilence.\n\nSilence is one of the worst torcherers.\n\nSilence lets you hear all of the small monsters of your brain. Unable to drown them out with activity or alcohol, they started taking over. Everything from his early childhood, and the feelings of disappointment from his parents that he showed no spark of magic within him. To all the doubts he had ever about himself. Memories of failures.\n\nMemories of his death and how stupid he was to make himself a target.\n\nThese monsters picked at his brain for what seemed like days before he could shake them off.\n\nI need to stop this. I need to focus on now. The past is the past. Where am I now? What should I do? Think Raphe. What Would Cayden Do?\n\nHe was in Limbo, he thought, or at least a limbo. Maybe Cayden was still testing him? Unsure of what else to do, Raphe took the time to go through his Meditations. He drew his rapier and went through the Forms of Cayden, clearing his mind as he did so, focusing only on the problem at hand.\n\nIf Cayden is testing me what does he want?\n\nFrom a simple Swallow Greets the Morning he moves into the more complex Hounds Chase the Fox.\n\nCayden never asks for anything but for his followers to embrace life, do good, help others, and never let your sense of duty override doing what is right… is that all?\n\nNot even breaking a sweat he moved directly into the more defensive The Wind and The Reed.\n\nCayden does not like stagnation. He can’t stand boredom. He prizes wit and intelligence as much, or more than brawn.\n\nExcited by the fact that he was not even breathing heavy, Raphe moved into the final form, or at least the last one he learned, and the most aggressive, The Falcon and the Snake.\n\nCayden wouldn’t just abandon a follower, but he also wouldn’t reward someone that was befell by misfortune that he brought on himself. He can’t save everyone, but he wouldn’t leave them in a place such as this. Since I cannot see that I have done anything to anger him, or anything that was too stupid that he would abandon me, then maybe there is something else going on here.\n\nHis mind then turned to the Visitor.\n\nNo servant of Cayden would ever ask anyone to kill a child. I may have been tasked with mentoring the child, or saving the child, or even teaching the child, but never killing one. A true servant of Good would have at least waited until the child had become an adult and no longer innocent or savable. Ergo he must have been a servant of Evil, or worse Neutrality. Cayden would never let such a one into his domain.  \n\nAs he finishes the final form, Raphe is still amazed at not feeling tired at all. How long had it been since he last slept? How long had he been in this limbo? It feels like forever. Has it been days? Weeks? He stopped counting ales after the first hundred. With no day or night, no need to sleep or relieve himself, no ebb and flow of crowds, he had lost all sense of time.\n\nHe now knew what he needed to do. He needed to reach out directly to Cayden. To do so he would need to be completely focused, he would need to summon more power than he ever has before. He set to work on designing the ritual. Thinking back to his training here at the bar just a few years ago.\n\n***\n\nRaphe turned to his teacher after a daunting lesson on ritual, “Why do we bother with these rituals and Devotions? Cayden doesn’t seem like the type of god to go for such ostentations. I think he just laughs at us when we do this.”\n\nHis teacher, Brother Orisai, an older man with white hair and a world weary face, looked at him thoughtfully before he spoke.\n\n“The power of a Cleric is not directly from the Power of their god, “ Brother Orisai told him, “but rather from the spark of divinity within the Cleric focused through your belief and closeness to your god. This is why a Cleric of Torag and a Cleric of Cayden both have the same abilities and same access to spells and divine favors, even though Torag is much older. Rituals, symbols, devotions, and all the trappings of a Cleric are not because the gods are vain, but they are there to sharpen your own will, your own resolve, and bring your own inner divinity closer with that of your god. So even though Cayden does not require much of us, and often laughs at the idea of ritualized worship of him, we must still use these tools if we are to bring our own Spark close enough to his to be of service.”\n\nBrother Orisai was one of the few Priests of Cayden that was a Cleric before he converted. They say that he was once a High Priest of the High God Rummentens, a god of Wealth and Law from beyond the Sea, but he had lost his faith when the laws of his lands brought about misery and his god disapproved of his way of changing them. He found Cayden while in exile and pledged his life to Cayden’s cause of doing the right thing no matter what.\n\n \n\n***\n\nRemembering Brother Orisai’s words, Raphe cleared off the Area in front of the small alter at the back of the bar. He skillfully arranged pints of ale, beer nuts, candles, and even a small tankard of rum. Using what Symbols in Celestial and Draconic he inscribes a circle of power, mostly using salt and the chalk from the dart board.  The Circle was a mess, mostly because Priests are never really taught how to use them, he pulled the design from memories of his childhood when his father would communicate with other worldly beings. He inscribed Cayden’s Full name in a number of spots, as well as his titles, paying close attention to his Title of Protector of Children.\n\nAfter a long time he felt that his preparations were complete. It looked official. It felt official. And even better it made him feel official. He wished he had some incense or a least some Mutton roasting to complete the engagement of all five senses.\n\nSlowly he began the ritual, walking around the circle, chanting the five names of Cayden Cailean, before entering the circle and approaching the alter. Once there he poured the ale, wine, and rum, taking care not to spill. When he felt the power within him reach the correct level he let it out with his plea.\n\n“Cayden Cailean, The Accidental God, The Lucky Drunk, The Drunken Hero, Protector of Children, Hear Me! I am Raphe D’Ovamore, a Priest of your following. There is a Child that needs your help and it is for this I beseech you. A Stranger greeted me on my arrival to this realm and tried to get me to agree to murder a child in exchange for my life. I would not agree and I believe he has trapped me here in this limbo because of my refusal. I believe that he does not want his intentions know to you. So I reach out to you, Cayden, Protector of Children. This child is in danger and this Being has tried to profane one of your priests into performing the murder. This is an insult to you and everything you stand for. Please help this child. If you wish, I will be your instrument. If you do choose me, I promise to be smarter about it than last time.“\n\nWith that Raphe raised his own tankard of ale, and in one blast he released all the Divine Energy he had stored, and drank deeply.\n\n“And if you don’t, could you please at least send me some company?”\n\nI hope that is enough. I hope the child will be safe.\n\nI hope I don’t run out of ale. ",

        "text": "Note: Anything in brackets was ignored by the PC.\n\nI'm the DM for a group of 6 adventurers.\n\nHalf-orc Barbarian, Human Rogue, Half-Elf Monk, Half-Elf Paladin, Elf Wizard, Elf Ranger\n\nThe Paladin's never played before, so when I was telling him about the pantheon I'd created, he latched onto the true neutral god because his spheres of influence include [life and] death.\n\nI didn't want to discourage him, so I said I'd allow it, but he would have to be NG because of the nature of paladin spells and other game mechanics. His first few sessions went pretty well, but then he had to interact with a civilian he'd wounded (crit fail on a thrown longsword). He told the guy to \"shut the fuck up,\" and walked away. I made a mental note of his action and moved on.\n\nWhile travelling through a forest to the large city, this same paladin was attacked by a werewolf. I figured he would be fine since he has a 21 AC. The dice decided they hated him, so the werewolf rolled a natural 20 on its attack, and the paladin rolled a 3 on his save. I felt pretty bad about the situation, but learned a valuable lesson about what to attack people with when they can't make it to a session.\n\nI decided since it was my underestimation that gave him lycanthropy, I'd give him an easy out by going to his god's temple and finding a cleric. He hadn't had a good opportunity to show his character's personality up to this point, which was very proud. He went so far as to attempt to use his mount to threaten a cure out of the cleric. This triggered an alignment shift, and he's taken the Oathbreaker archetype.\n\nAs I was playing the cleric, I had an idea to give him a test of humility. Unfortunately, this cleric is apparently also very proud and flawed (which didn't come out until his PC cut him off mid-sentence and threatened him with a dire wolf).\n\nIn character, I told the paladin of the orb under the temple, and I mentioned a scythe that was powerful [and dark, and said to be careful with it].  He naturally took the scythe, and brought the orb up to the temple proper [receiving a vision from his god in which the scythe corrupts him, and his ambition of bringing his order of paladins back to the \"right path\" is ultimately meaningless, because he was no longer aligned with his god]. The cleric, seeing the scythe, and getting bitched at for not telling the paladin about every little aspect of the dungeon, decided to let him leave the temple with the scythe (he's actually playing his character very well, but I'm new to DMing so his arrogance is annoying to me).\n\nA few failed charisma saves later, the paladin can't find it within himself to part with a weapon of such power, despite being aware of how evil it is (DC 22, fighting gods is hard, man). The party wizard suggests going to the temple again, and upon arriving and asking the cleric for \"help\" (a quick fix), the paladin cuts him off mid-sentence again, and is told to leave and figure it out if he thinks he can.\n\nAs the party tries to take the weapon from him, he attacks and initiative is rolled. Since I don't want this to get out of hand, the cleric comes back, and casts Greater Restoration to sever the paladins tie with the scythe, and all is well...until a pair of assassins who worship the scythe's creator enter and attempt to steal the scythe.\n\nIn the first round of combat, the paladin breaks his bonds and picks up the goddamn scythe again (like I said, he's role playing very well), at which point I actually face-palmed and stopped feeling bad for his character. Role playing as the assassin, I got a solid hit on the scythe-wielding paladin, dropping him in one blow (poison, sneak attack, and high dice rolls).\n\nUpon combat ending, the wizard hides the scythe, sealing it away with an arcane lock; the cleric rage-heals the paladin, punches him in the face, performs the greater restoration ritual again, and berates the paladin for his arrogance storming out of the chapel...\n\nAnd then the paladin compared what I did to feeding a dog something poisonous, then getting pissed off when it actually bites. I do feel bad, but I wonder how he'll feel if he keeps going in this direction and can no longer summon his mount.\n\nTL;DR: Gave a PC a powerful, evil, sentient weapon; his character learned nothing; and I'm an asshole.\n\nEdited for formatting.",

        "text": "You ever have that one player who has played so many games with you, that they know your plot twists before you do?\n\nSo I will be the first to admit that as a DM I sometimes enjoy messing with my players a little too much. One of my favorite ways to do this is with Attic Whisperers, the spirits of abused and neglected children who create bodies from discarded toys and animal bones. My very first game with Steve and Al left them trapped and unarmed in the dungeon of a vindictive king, tortured by the souls of lost children who just wanted someone new to play with.\n\nThat adventure was such a success (for me) that the attic whisperers showed up time and again whenever I felt the game needed a little more of a \"creepy\" factor, and my players became more and more jumpy around children in general in my games. With good reason, because as creepy as attic whisperers are, sometimes they just weren't enough for me, which lead me to homebrew them a little (I do this a lot, mostly because my players have been known to check the monster manual for weaknesses while I have my back turned or are otherwise distracted). Enter the Whispering Orphan, all the powers of an Attic Whisperer, but disguised to look like any other living child.\n\nAnd here we are in the bright shining city of Ombaktu, and Al and Steve are running in a little one-off before the rest of the party arrives for the main mission. The Holy General Sagramoor's child has gone missing, and in his grief, he sends our two brave heroes to find her. This leads Steve to give me a less-than-happy look, he knows where this is going.\n\nOur heroes go off on a wild search, taking down a satanic orgy cult in their travels, and making a deal with a polymorphed blue dragon, the rest of our group arrives earlier than anticipated, so rather than have the dynamic duo face down the final threat, a vampire, the daughter of the General pulls on Steve's cloak and utters the fateful words: \"I'm lost, will you play with me?\"\n\n\"I shoot it in the face\" says Archer Steve.\n\n\"What?\" says the exasperated DM, trying to wrap this up so the actual game can start.\n\n\"I shoot the kid in the face.\" Says Archer Steve again, rolling his dice and scoring a critical. \n\nThe child drops to the ground, her stuffed bunny falling from her grasp, staring, not understanding, a scream is heard from an open doorway, Archer Steve is mad at the DM because \"the kids are always freaking ghost children, you changed it because I attacked first.\" The guards have been called, and the rest of the party spends the day rescuing Archer Steve from execution, instead of saving the world from the Jungle Queen, who uses her army of zombie gorillas to bring on ten thousand years of darkness.\n\nDon't kill children guys, no matter how creepy they've been in the past.",
