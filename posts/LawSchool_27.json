I am 2 weeks in and now realize this office is totally understaffed and nobody is trying to get me into any actual substantive work. Everyone is too busy to supervise me. Instead, I have been assigned a bunch of clerical work and nobody seems to care I am doing basically 1L work. \n\nI have a ton of externship experience and I’m a third year student and certified for prelims. I’m also actually working in this exact type of job (different office though) after I graduate so I really wanted to get practical experience. \n\nShould I ask someone to transfer me to a different unit? I know there is one that is better for getting practical experience. If they refuse to transfer me, should I quit? I can’t imagine a whole semester of doing clerical work that no one wants to do when I was promised a different kind of work.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10knv68)",

The university found out I reported them to the headquarters and kicked me out of their university. They said I have no right to do that nor hire an attorney. I am livid. I already contacted lawyers and the biggest red flag is the law school did not kick me out the university part kicked me out of law school with out their say. There is a lot that I can't discuss but this is unbelievable because all I did was report threats/ harassment and with no investigating the university kicked me out.

I’ve heard everything from oral lectures to full closed book exams, to handwritten essays being proposed to ensure cheating doesn’t take place (while most of these discussion’s were geared towards undergrad, the same can and will be applied to law schools). The sentiment is that if students use ChatGPT to cheat, the prof./schools will take away any opportunity to do so. \n\nMoral of the story, don’t use ChatGPT to cheat in law school.

        "text": "Hello\n\nI am writing a grad thesis on insider trading and have difficulties finding relevant case law, as I dont have all the resources you guys have (like westlaw etc) because I am from EU. \n\nMy question is quite simple: if  Chiarella v. United States established that there has to be fiduciary duty broken for insider trading (and in such case only those that have fiduciary duty may be liable) was it  Dirks v. SEC that established that not only those who have fiduciary duty ay be liable for insider trading (tipper), but also tippee as well (if there was still fiduciary duty broken). Are the other important cases that would talk about liability of other  (not corporate insiders lets call them) insiders?\n\nAlso, could you recommend other cases on insider dealing in USA (could be SEC, SCOTUS etc)? I am mostly interested in cases on use of insider information as cause for transaction, negative effects etc? I found a lot of cases in different articles referenced but it is quite difficult to filter which are important and which are not as I am not very exposed to US legal system:)\n\nThank you in advance!",

I texted them if they could give me their PayPal and got no answer. I texted every day for good 2 weeks… I never got a reply. I guess someone texted the seller and offered even more money even though the bidding was finished.

I've been trying to utilize my network, do some cold e-mails and phone calls, etc., but nothing has clicked yet.

When I get the offer I express gratitude, but then say hey, I have a few other interviews I would like to see through, and I asked for 2 weeks to decide. He said im disappointed and asked where the other interviews were. After telling them he gave a sales pitch and I said I completely understand I just don't want to accept before going through. He then asked if the other positions would start in February and I said they were in the summer. Here is where his tone shifted and said you can continue to do those interviews and accept this position, if you wish to leave in may you can, additionally if you want to stay that is also fine. I apologized and he said, I understand, it speaks to your character to be forthcoming. Then we did the whole 9 talked about coming in on the third. Then I apologized again to which he replied, no need to bring it up again. That really rubbed me the wrong way and it made me uncomfortable. Did I do something wrong by asking for more time ? do I not have a summer position, did I ruin it ?",
