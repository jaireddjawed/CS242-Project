We are responsible for submitting the documents to them. My friend did this. Unfortunately, not many people know that you then have to link your PhysiciansApply account to your CaRMS, which results in programs not receiving your proof of citizenship. \n\nMy friend got an email from a couple of faculties 2 days before the program rank list was due, stating they didn’t receive her proof of citizenship. She then promptly linked the accounts, and it’s fixed, however, is it possible that the programs that interviewed her now will not rank her because of this? I would imagine if they saw this during file review, they wouldn’t have even invited her to interview. However, checking the citizenship doc may be the task of PGME offices, not programs.\n\nIf anyone has gone through this, would really appreciate advice and insight. Thank you in advance",

She helped with/observed induction and end of surgery, but wasn't there for the actual bulk of the case. When I asked her if this was her regular, she said she was rarely really solo; she either was supervising CRNAs or teaching residents. \n\nI'm not sure if anesthesia is what I want to do, but I do know that regardless of what I do, I want to be *doing* more than supervising. So from this I have two questions: \n1) is attending anesthesia life mostly supervising or will you be able to do cases yourself? \n2) aside from emergencies, is the middle of the case really important or something I'd feel like I'm missing out on? I've not been able to observe in the OR yet, so I don't know what that looks like.",

As I enter my second year, my husband will be departing from the military. He does have plans of returning to school/working in order to support us while I’m in school but he also wants to begin trying for a baby. For reference: I’ll be 25-26 at the time. If things go according to plan I’ll likely be in school until ~30, have around a 3 year IM residency, and then hopefully a fellowship.  While I do know I wouldn’t be knocking on deaths door, waiting until I reach attending status will mean I’d have a geriatric pregnancy and also will mean my husband wouldn’t be able to have a family for an additional 10 years. \n\nHaving a child can strain any relationship even when something as stressful as being a medical student/resident/fellow is not a factor. My biggest worries are that I will be studying and I’ll be studying a lot - leaving very little time for the relationship between my husband and I even without a little one in the picture. I am of course also worried about the lack of sleep that babies bring and once I reach the point that I enter clinicals and prepare for residency, I’m worried I’ll be spread too thin. I’m also worried about never being around - such demanding schedules are usually not very friendly for families. \n\nMy question(s) is (are): how exactly did you navigate this? Did anyone here decide to wait until training was complete to begin their family? Anyone decide to not have children altogether?\n\nLastly, any major regrets having a child in medical school or deciding to not have one thus far?",

Are there any resources that you guys used that can help me bridge my knowledge gap or help me do better on rounds?\n\nFor example, I got a PICU transfer for DKA today and I don't really know when they would be stable to go home.

I said sure. He began to ask me some personal questions, one of them being about where I lived. I told him I was living with family at the time. He proceeded to say, “So you’re a parasite.”\n\nThese unprofessional, unwarranted comments made me resentful. In addition to problems that were occurring at home which I found myself in the middle of, I began to lose focus on my studies and ultimately lose interest in continuing at the school.\n\nI eventually decided to go see the class counselor. I didn’t report the student-related incidents at that time, and when asked what the issue was, I kept it vague. I said it was multifactorial, including issues at home. We discussed taking a one-year leave of absence and continuing my education where I would have left off. During my time off, I received a follow-up email from the school saying that I needed to come back before the one year to start back up at the beginning of the fall term. Meaning I would have to entirely redo my first year. I decided to withdraw. An emotional decision, but I was pissed.\n\nAfter some time, I decided to try to get my withdrawal overturned, citing extenuating circumstances, but this request was unsuccessful. After some back and forth via email, I requested a meeting with one of the deans but did not receive a response. My dad, who also happens to be a physician, requested a meeting with a dean, and his request was granted. Another infuriating event.\n\nTo end, I know I could have handled all of this in a much better way. I let my emotions get the best of me. Now I find myself wanting to go back to medical school, but feel as if there is a huge mountain to climb (motivation level now vs when I first applied, reapplying, old MCAT score, withdrawal, etc.).",

What if I match at the bottom of my list? I don’t know. I don’t even remember what I had for dinner two nights ago. I also don’t know if I locked my car unless I consciously lock it twice minimum. CONSCIOUSLY! This is why I am feeling this way. I try to do as many things consciously. Oh and then NRMP is expecting us to just sit tight and wait for the results when all they have to do is literally pushing the button? How cruel is that? I am very sad. I don’t even drink alcohol these days and I might have to just for this week so the time can go faster. Dogs are barking outside and my heart is racing and I am nervous.

        "text": "I'm really, really struggling with knowing if I'm cut out for general surgery (no pun intended). MS3 is ending in just a few weeks, and honestly, I haven't enjoyed most rotations. The only one that I did enjoy was surgery (and to a lesser extent, OB/GYN), particularly because I felt like I was actually doing something productive in the OR. The immediate impact felt great. I feel like so much of medicine is just talking, rounding, trying a new med, and then waiting to see what happens. It's just too slow for me and I feel like I'm just wasting most of my day on most rotations. Plus, I think the OR is an awesome place. A team all focused on accomplishing the same goal—very cool environment overall. I actually feel like I'm doing doctor-things during an operation. Also, in gen surg I felt like you learned a bunch of medicine as well, so I felt like surgeons are super complete docs. \n\nBut I can't get over the lifestyle aspect of surgery. I constantly read people's posts about how the hours for a surgeon are miserable. I'm very passionate about my health and like to workout pretty much every day, and I hope to have a family one day as well. I like to chill and my mental health is important to me (I'm prone to anxiety). I've been going back and forth for months; some days I'm totally sure I can do surgery, the next day I freak out about what I'd be committing myself to and I get cold feet and start questioning if I'm making a huge mistake. The only rotation I haven't done yet is EM, btw.\n\nI don't know what to do or how to approach this. I just don't want to be miserable. Is this a normal feeling/is this a sign that surgery isn't for me? How do I know? What do I dooooo.... ANY help would be so much appreciated. Thank you all!",

        "text": "See title. I've always had a problem with internet use but I think med school took that and made the issue 100x worse. Between reddit, twitter, tik tok, youtube, netflix, and maybe half a dozen other sites plus video games, I literally spend more time online or in front of the TV than I do actually studying. I have also somehow made it to age 24 without any friends I talk to on a regular basis which means I don't have any IRL people to speak to aside from calling my parents (no siblings either).\n\nI was always the lonely/socially isolated kid as far back as middle school and ended up turning to the internet as a \"cope\" for not having any actual friends or IRL experiences. Unfortunately I've gotten stuck in this trap more or less permanently and I legit don't know what I need to do to turn my life around. I tried being social for the first few months of med school and made some decent friends/acquaintances but it's kinda hard to relate to people as someone who's in a completely different life stage as everyone else. Like people are legit getting married and reminiscing about the \"good old days\" and stuff with their high school buddies and I'm still stuck at the emotional equivalent of a 12 year old who's never been in a relationship, has zero close friends, and did literally nothing for the past entire decade aside from 1) getting into med school and 2) waste my life playing video games and browsing the internet. So every time I try to \"log off\" and focus on the real world I just get intensely depressed and feel like I'd rather drown out my emotions with the internet again.\n\nI think the worst part is that I'm not even doing that badly at school. I'm smart enough that I can slack off, spend just a couple hours a day actually studying, and still score around average which is more than enough to pass at my P/F school. So there's no incentive for me to change my behavior either. I tried talking opening up to a few people I know about my issues but every time I do this I just get confronted with extreme doom and gloom reactions. My older cousin (M4 at a different school) told me I should probably just drop out if I ever want to get my life together. My parents are also kinda loners and don't have any solutions because they don't see anything wrong with my life. Another guy I thought was sort of a friend decided to give me a \"polite\" lecture about how I might actually be developmentally disabled and should seek out a possible autism diagnosis (I don't think I come off this way IRL? but at least 2 other people have told me that my face doesn't express the right emotions which weirds them out.)\n\nSo I am completely lost and don't know what to do. Should I see a professional therapist? A psychiatrist? Do I just give up and acknowledge that I'm gonna be a loner for the rest of my life? Honestly at a complete and total loss here. Any suggestions would be appreciated :/",

Since the post and the attention it’s gotten, I’ve been thinking and would like to share some thoughts. First of all, yeah it was kinda scary to name and shame. However, in the real world, there was no actual retribution or knowledge of my identity. I’m still a resident in good standing who’s kicking ass in my program. Second of all, when I talk to friends in other professional careers, they are blown away by how little we feel comfortable sharing in the medical field and how few rights we have. Never forget that the NRMP, USMLE, AMA, etc are MONOPOLIES. We have to remember that there is strength in numbers, and every time someone speaks up against bullshit in a way that names it, the stronger we get and the closer we get to dealing with less bullshit.  We don’t deserve it, and there’s enough literature about how burnout negatively impacts patient outcomes to know that it negatively affects our patients, and they don’t deserve it.\n\nSo I guess what I’m saying is that each of our voices (even anonymous) are powerful and valuable and worth being heard. I would like to encourage more of us to speak out, so if you want to and can without repercussions I would like to ask you to consider to adding to my name and shame big dick energy. I would be beyond delighted to hear from more of you below in the comments about the bullshit you’ve faced and how it affected you, so I encourage you to also name and shame. \n\nTLDR: let’s get empowered, keep up the name and shame or contribute to a mass vent sesh below 👾",

        "text": "Looking into these two specialties and am honestly very confused about which to go through with. I have worked with physicians in both fields and can see myself happy regardless of what I choose. I definitely lean towards plastic surgery just because I like the bread-and-butter procedures slightly more and have been interested in the field longer so I've gotten to know residents and physicians at my home and outside institutions (if that's of any benefit). I still really like ENT though and think it would be more lifestyle-conducive in the future, with the opportunity to do facial plastics if I really wanted to. It would also be nice to still do some medicine during my practice. \n\nHowever, I do know that plastic surgery is basically the most competitive specialty out there, even though ENT isn't that far behind. Is ENT any less competitive compared to plastic surgery to justify choosing one over the other? If I do go through with plastic surgery, I would most likely take a research year, but if I go through with ENT, I would try to find a research year opportunity but might have to just go straight through.",
