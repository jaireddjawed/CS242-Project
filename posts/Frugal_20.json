I would order 20 lbs of mushrooms or a crate of tomatoes or 25 lbs of quinoa/chickpeas… I know this is not for everyone but it was great for me. For instance, I enjoyed prepping and freezing the mushrooms, and the throwing them into risottos or curries for months. Saved me time AND money because those were wholesale prices. But now that restaurants are back in action, restaurant suppliers have turned their back on me. Do you all have any ideas where I can order bulk quantities of veggies and grains? I live in New York and don’t have a car, so can’t make it to big box stores that I have to drive to.",

        "text": "Here’s a frugal tip for those of you who need soil in bulk. This doesn’t work if you only need a small amount. \n\nI recently purchased a home that wasn’t maintained as much as it should be. Rain over the years washed out the garden and lawn. We had 20-40 foot beds that needed 6-12 inches of soil to top them up. \n\nI checked around for prices and top soil here costs about $35 per yard (yard is like 5-8 wheelbarrows). So 10 yards would be $350. This does not include the $150 delivery fee. \n\nThe alternative options is I could get soil dumped into my truck at 1-2 yards at a time and still pay $350 but avoid the delivery fee. \n\nBags are not even an options. The cheapest I’ve found is $2.48 for a cubic foot so 10 yards would be 270 bags = $669 plus tax\n\nInstead, I called a local pool excavation company. Weeks later a dump truck showed up at my house. He brought 12 yards of soil. I asked for 10 but they want to get rid of as much as possible. Anything less than 10 and they’ll say no. \n\nDelivery was free. Soil was free. I dumped it on my driveway on a Harbor Freight tarp. 12 yards was about 60-80 wheelbarrows so easily 10 man hours of backbreaking work.\n\nIf you decide to call around, be prepared, they will bring a lot of soil. To increase the likelihood of the company saying yes, you want to basically ask for a truck load. They are wasting time by bringing a half load to your house. \n\nIf you can’t use it, notify your neighbors you have a lot of soil coming and to help themselves. \n\nThe soil quality if I paid $350-500 at the yard would be a bit better, but after I put a yard of compost on this for $35, it will be competitive.\n\nI think $35 instead of $500 is a win and I had to share.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10skxqa/help_uber_keeps_charging_me_for_ride_canceled_by/",
        "text": "TL;DR Uber is repeatedly charging me for a ride that the driver canceled. Their customer support refuses to fix it. How can I escalate this so that I don't lose money?\n\nHi, I really need advice: Uber keeps charging me for a ride that was canceled by the driver. I've sent countless emails to their customer support and have contacted them on Facebook, but they refuse to fix it. Here's the situation:\n\n* My original ride was for October 2022. I had prescheduled the ride the day before and paid an extra fee in return for the driver waiting up to 5 minutes.\n* On the day of the ride, the driver arrived at my location early and called me to say they were downstairs. I said I'd be right there, and he said, \"No, I'm not waiting.\" By the time I got downstairs, 2 minutes later, I saw the back bumper of his car as he drove off. Five minutes after my scheduled pickup time, I got an email from Uber saying that the driver had waited for me but I didn't show up on time, so I was going to be charged a fee of about $32.\n* That same day, I got in touch with Uber and explained the situation. The customer support rep that I spoke to said that I did not owe anything and would not be charged, and that the charge showing up on my credit card was only an authorization hold and would disappear. I told him no, it was not an authorization hold because it was not listed among my pending charges anymore. It had already gone from pending charge to posted charge and needed to be refunded. The Uber rep refused to believe me and kept repeating that it was an authorization hold and would disappear. After a few messages back and forth, I told him that Uber needed to refund me, and if they did not refund me, I would file a chargeback with my credit card. He stopped responding.\n* The charge was not refunded and so I filed a chargeback with my credit card, using the Uber rep's written confirmation that I did not owe any money as my supporting documentation.\n* I don't use Uber often, so several months passed before I opened up the app again. When I tried to use the app again, I scheduled a new ride and paid for it -- and only after I had paid for what I thought was my new ride did it tell me that it was charging me again for the ride back in October. I filed a second credit card chargeback, confused about how this had happened. Then it happened a third time.\n* I got back in touch with Uber customer service. This time, they told me that they were unable to refund me because refund requests have to be submitted within 30 days of the ride in question. I told them that I did submit a refund request within 30 days, and that they could confirm this by looking in their own records. I've gone back and forth with Uber reps many times about this, but they keep repeating that refund requests have to be submitted within 30 days.\n* I've also tried reaching out to Uber over Facebook messenger, but I haven't gotten far. The rep responded to me ask for my contact information so they could follow up, I gave it to them and explained the situation, and then they get back in touch a few hours later to ask for my contact information...the information I'd already sent them. I'm not optimistic that this will go any better than customer support over email.\n\nI'm really shocked at how poor Uber's customer service is, and I'm at the point where I'm ready to just delete my Uber app. \n\nThe original ride that I was supposed to take on October 2022 was my ride to the airport. After the Uber driver canceled on me, I had to scramble to find a cab. It cost me twice as much, and I was worried that I'd miss my flight. I feel like Uber is now holding my account hostage until I pay for the experience of being screwed over. The fee is not that much (about $32), but it's not nothing -- and I also refuse to pay it on principle.\n\nAny ideas on what I could do? I wasn't sure what sub to post this on, but I think I've seen other posts on r/Frugal from people in similar situations. Thanks for any help you can give.",

        "text": "We moved last year, and we had a very warm summer so we never got a sense of how effective the insulation/heating is in our new place. But this winter was very cold. We're in an old building that is not well insulated, all single pane windows, high ceilings. We're billed every two months, and our last power bill absolutely sky rocketed. I work from home, and spend basically 99% of the day chained to a desk, so I really don't even need to heat an entire room let alone the whole house. Effectively I just need a single radiant heat source in front of me to keep my face/chest/hands toasty while I work. Of course I could buy a small electric space heater, but I'm curious if a terracotta pot heater would ultimately be cheaper in the long run. I know you can get really cheap tea candles, and can even buy raw paraffin wax by the block. I know that vegetable oils and shortening are effective and relatively clean burning fuels too. But between the options I don't know which burns the best/longest and which is the most cost effective. Tea candles seem like the obvious choice, but are quite short lasting. \n\nSo I guess my questions are, do any of you have experience with terracotta pot heaters and if so have you done the napkin math on what the cheapest fuel is? If not, do you have other frugal tips for heating (that don't involve renovations).\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Here's my tip for the very frugal in cold climates. It works especially well for households with fewer people where the house is empty a lot.\n\nI have spent years needing to rent very poorly maintained old houses in very cold winters. The first thing I always do is add a programmable thermostat. It's easy, they're relatively cheap, and landlord opinions don't matter so just go ahead. You can take it with when you leave. \n\nThe trick is to just program the thermostat to always turn the temperature back down to the lowest you can stand when using any other tips like dressing warm at home, heated blankets, etc. Warm enough that extended periods won't cause cold spots in basements or walls to burst pipes though.\n\nThe advantage is that any time you want it warmer you are free to go over and make the choice to spend money on that comfort, but at programmed times it will turn it back down. \n\nI chose a time an hour before I usually leave in the morning, because I'm usually fully dressed by then and it takes a while for the house to cool. Again mid day in case I'm home or stop in at lunch and turn it up. Again about the time I get home. Again about when I settle down to relax, again before bed and once shortly after bed. The only exception I make is right before I get up when it turns it up because I hate morning enough already and with most the registers shut that gets my bedroom and bathroom to a super warm 68.\n\nMost thermostats have that many times, but you could condense them. I can usually get my base turn down temp to 56 and almost never have to turn it up except when I have company, ran out of laundry, or just really want to relax. Not that I haven't just told company to go ahead and keep a layer on if we're not staying long. \n\nReally keeps the heat bill down with no conscious effort, and makes it easy to decide every once in a while to enjoy some extra heat while you learn to acclimate and adapt to the cold.",

Based on that, I am trying to get together a list of common sales and sales categories that happen throughout the year to help me better plan my purchases. \n\nFor example:\n- TVs are generally better priced around the Super Bowl than on Black Friday \n- Fitness equipment goes on sale in January (curious if this is actually true)\n- Computers and small apartment basics go on sale as kids prepare to head off to dorms in the summer\n\nSo I’m wondering:\n- Does anyone have a reliable list of these kinds of things? \n- Maybe we can compile one here? \n- Would also love to hear about sales that have turned out to be “sales” like if it’s November and I’ve saved up for an exercise bike is it actually worth waiting til January?",

        "text": "The typical American grass lawn, especially if it is maintained with gas-powered mowers and blowers, costs a lot to maintain, contributes nothing to the ecosystem, and is a major source of pollution. \n\nConvert turf grass areas to all natives: trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants. You won’t have to mow or hire someone to do it. \n\nThe pollinators and insect predators your native plants attract will take care of pest control and improve quality and yield for your food garden crops. \n\nLeaves are free mulch.  Leave them on the ground where they will close the nutrient loop and help the ground retain moisture. \n\nGently sweep or rake leaves off the driveway and sidewalks, but otherwise leave them alone. \n\nThe eggs for next year’s lightning bugs and butterflies are on the undersides of those leaves. By spring, the leaves will have decomposed, and caterpillars will be in the trees and on the ground. \n\nCaterpillars are the only thing baby birds eat, so if you get your leaves hauled away, there goes next year’s birds. \n\nPut your outdoor lights on motion detectors. Having your outside lights on constantly creates reliable shadows in which thieves can easily hide anyway. Lights on motion detectors are a better deterrent. \n\nLeaving lights on all night wastes expensive electricity and is terrible for the health of people and animals. \n\nDon’t have your yard sprayed or treated for mosquitoes. Despite what Mosquito Joe might tell you, even if the pesticides used are “organic” pyrethrins made from chrysanthemums, they are indiscriminate killers of all insects — good and bad. Plus, the sprays only kill adult mosquitoes. \n\nA better tactic is to police all unintentional sources of standing water, then put a bucket of water with some grass clippings and a mosquito dunk in an inconspicuous place. \n\nThe mosquito dunks are a bacteria that is harmless to people, pets, birds, etc. \n\nThe bonus you get from these money-saving changes is more birds, pollinators, butterflies, skinks, and dragonflies. \n\nLocal native plants gardening enthusiasts will gladly share plants with you, as well as advice. As your plants get established and proliferate, you will have plants to share and trade.",
