If this is true then... who wanted to evolve to just a human??\n\nNow, there are some confirmed models of the Hito Hito no Mi:\n\n* [Nika, based off a Sun god](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hito_Hito_no_Mi,_Model:_Nika)\n\n* [Daibutsu, based off Buddha](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hito_Hito_no_Mi,_Model:_Daibutsu)\n\n* [Onyudo, based off a japanese yokai that looks like a giant monk](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hito_Hito_no_Mi,_Model:_Onyudo)\n\nNotice a theme here?  They are all have religious themes.  And what about Chopper?  Are we expected to believe that he just at the Hito Hito no Mi Model: Athiest or something??  Chopper's hybrid form is way too cue to be an athiest.\n\nI think the plain Hito Hito no Mi doesn't exist and Chopper at a model that's based off another religious figure.  But which one???\n\nWith the Hito Hito no Mi, so far there has been a connection between the user and the model.  Luffy has liberated countless people.  Sengoku has an afro.  Onimaru was an actual fox which is what Onyudo disguise themselves as.  So... what clues can we find out about Chopper?\n\nWell, let's see.... his birthday is December 24th... he essentially wants to heal all of mankind... he has no sexual interest in human women...  and his most meme'd moment is him weeping.  Not to mention that he looks up to God Usopp...\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this?\n\n\nThis also finally explains why Blackbeard was at Drum Island.  He was obviously looking for this Devil Fruit because there'd be nothing more advantageous to Blackbeard than the ability to walk on water and turn water into booze.",

        "text": "It's officially break week, so you know what that means. I've got way too much time to think about all of the crazy possibilities of the future of One Piece. I've had this thought for a while, but after the appearance of a certain character this chapter, it's coming back to the forefront of my mind. \n\n\nThe One Piece itself is shrouded in mystery and linked in some way to the Void Century and true history of the world. If it fell into the wrong hands, it could turn the world upside down and harm a lot of people. I think that a certain someone was on Roger's crew, found the One Piece, and has taken an interest in making sure the right person, maybe even a certain Joyous Boy, is the one to find the One Piece next. \n\n\nThis is a person who we have seen since chapter 1. Someone who has been along for every major step along the way. He's been on pretty much every important island, oftentimes ahead of the Strawhats, to keep up with current events. They've been seen in the company of such villains as Baroque Works, in Makino's bar, and most recently supporting the might of the Red-Haired pirates. \n\n\nWho is this mysterious man? Of course, it's PANDA MAN!!! Panda Man has charged himself with the monumental task of ensuring that the right crew and right captain finds the One Piece. He has been a silent force in the background of the One Piece world since the very beginning, and I believe he will be there at the very end of it all. \n\n\nPanda Man will welcome Luffy and his crew to Laugh Tale, where they must pass a Where's Waldo style test to proceed. Why? What evidence is there? What possible reason could there be? \n\n\nI'll tell you later, but for now just trust me bro. Don't think about it too much and go celebrate break week by catching up on some TV and games. Maybe go touch some grass. See you all on the other side of break week!",

        "text": "Garp will likely retire by the end of the series along with Sengoku and any other old marine, so they're out imo.\n\nI think Smoker will take helm as fleet admiral. He's got the spirit of a leader, he didn't hesitate to sacrifice himself for his men on Punk Hazard, and he's got ambitions to change the navy, which he needs the position to do.\n\nNext I believe Koby will become an admiral, it's already his dream to be one and with his progress, I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes the youngest admiral in history.\n\nThe next 2 admirals are hard to decide. Helmeppo could potentially be one as he is also very gifted for his age, but at the same time I can only see him reach vice-admiral. I suppose Tashigi could become an admiral, proving her swordsmanship to Zoro and herself, but the nr 1 will still be Zoro of course. But then again, I believe the ship for her to become anything more than a vice admiral has sailed. She hasn't made much progress during the timeskip compared to Koby for example, which  is a shame because I really liked her character and was eager to see her progress.\n\nMomonga could also become an admiral by this point. He is popular and strong enough. But where he stands politically has yet to be shown.\n\nMy final candidate is Fujitora. I believe he will remain as an admiral by the end, as his kindness and good-natured spirit will allow him to keep his position by the end of the show. The same cannot be said for Kizaru, who while isn't as brutal as Sakazuki, has shown where his loyalties lie. Greenbull naturally is out, he is a fanatic.",

        "author": "robinator305",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11deysl/usopps_curse_theory/",
        "text": "So I've always had this kind of far fetched theory regarding Usopp and his lineage.  The theory involves 3 concepts from real life which I think may be the foundation of Usopp's hidden strength and lineage. The concepts are as follows. The first is the story of Pinocchio and the \"curse\" that was placed upon him. The second is Thor, and his battle with the giants as well as Loki. The third is the prophecy of Ragnarok\n\nUsopp's character design clearly draws inspiration from Pinocchio's trademark long pointy nose, but there is another character that also has this design, Usopp's mother Banchina. A character we barely get to see, since she is sick and bedridden until her death. At the time of her death Yasopp was off sailing with Shanks but Banchina never doubted Yasopp's intentions or his nobility. Why would Banchina not resent Yasopp for leaving her to become a pirate? Raising a child, near 20 years, and with an illness that eventually lead to her death. Why would Usopp not resent his father after all of that? The theory goes as follows; ***Usopp's mother, and subsequently Usopp himself, are cursed***. A curse which Yasopp has sailed the seas for years to try and break but has been unable to.\n\nTo understand the curse placed on Banchina first we have to understand some of the prophecy of Ragnarok. The short version of the prophecy is that it was made by a Giant named Groa, and talks about the end/rebirth of the world in which Oden and Thor are both killed. There are many parts to her prophecy but the main cause of all of it is Loki the god of mischief, a half Giant. I believe **there will be a very similar prophecy made by a Giant in One Piece, a prophecy which states that a Half Giant will cause Ragnarok.**\n\nDue to this prophecy Giants have basically completely isolated themselves from the world, but there are still quite a few giants outside of Elbaf how could this be? Would the elders of Elbaf risk a giant leaving and having a child with a non giant? Maybe the answer is a lot simpler than it seems. **Giants are to remain on Elbaf, the price to leave would be to never reproduce**. They may even have them drink something to make them infertile before they are allowed to leave/banished. Banchina however ignored the prophecy and got with Yasopp anyway, while she lied to giants about it. The giants found out and cursed her to normal size, banishing her from Elbaf, a curse which eventually killed her. They believed since she was no longer a giant there was no way she could have a half-giant child. The curse made her nose grow to punish Banchina and anyone who loves her but Yasopp did so anyway. They hoped the curse wouldn't be passed on to their child but upon seeing that Usopp too had the trademark long nose of the curse Yasopp left with Shanks to try and cure it.\n\nHow would this curse come about? I believe the easy answer is a devil fruit. A devil fruit that can manipulate someone's lineage factor would probably be able to stop someone from reproducing, and also able to alter a Giants lineage factor to that of another species. What would happen if someone were to \"lock\" a giant's lineage factor and replace it with that of a Tontatta? Would a giant suddenly grow a long nose and turn the size of a regular human? That is what I believe happened to Banchina, and that the owner of this fruit that cursed both Usopp and Banchina is somewhere on Elbaf.",

Either it will be because Shanks is a Tenryubito kid born in God Valley and raised by Roger (becoming a natural enemy to the Joyboy) or because he followed Roger's path and learned about the Lost Century and now wants the Joyboy to fully bloom before reaching Laugh Tale (Luffy, in this case, is the one reaching the last island)\n\nAnyway, that's my theory\n\nIt would also explain why Shanks would be the last enemy, he new Luffy's true power since day 0 and was waiting for him to develop his Akuma no Mi to the maximum\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nJust to clarify, I don't think he waited on Luffy so that he would be strong, I'm pretty sure Shanks was another one waiting for the return of the Joyboy. Who should be the true owner to the Hito Hito no Mi I'm unsure, but for me it makes sense that this was the plan after all the reveal about the steal from the navy",

He can throw a hunk of metal from high up into the ocean and magnetize luffy and make him fall into the ocean. But yeah, i also know luffy can defeat kid in many ways as well.\n\nThanks for reading :)",

        "text": "I know many people associated Shanks with Norse god Tyr because of one arm, but I think he can be more similar with Odin except that part. \nMany fans already think that Shanks is son of rocks or celestial dragons. I think he can be both like Odin's father was god and mother was giantess.\nWe know Shanks got scar from blackbeard but we don't know why they clashed. What if it was about some secrets? Fighting over valuable information seems to suit for both character. It makes sense to me if Shanks got information but also got scar on his eye like Odin gave up his eye for wisdom.\nShanks' crews are emphasized as strongest, most well balanced, threatening one many times. They might be inspired by Einherjar. Odin's chosen warriors who preparing¬†for¬†Ragnarok everyday. Shanks might gather great crews carefully to ready for final big war or event.\nIn 1076, Shanks seems to has long, close relationships with giants of Elbaf. I can imagine he having same one with their prince Loki, like in Norse mythology Odin was sworn brother of Loki.\nOdin wanted to gain knowledge/wisdom of things hidden from him and would do anything to achieve that. Shanks seems to has upper hand in the information and secrets department. Good example would be Nika fruit.\n\nIf Shanks inspired by Odin like Hancock inspired by Greek mythology, it would interesting.",

        "text": "Well oda has said he hopes no one dies and I‚Äôm taking this as people are going to die. So you do guys really think he‚Äôll start killing people off like a madman now that we‚Äôre in the endgame and if so who do you think will perish. \n\nHere are some of my picks off the top of my head \n\n1.captain eustass kid - sorry kid fans but he‚Äôs stumbled into shanks with his allied crews AND THE FUCKING GIANTS BACKING HIM! Big mom said the giant army backing her would be enough to take to one piece and well shanks seems to have their respect so I do not see how kid can survive this situation without a random massive wave killing shanks allies like roger vs shiki. \n\n2.trafalgar D. Water law - can see law dying in a 3 ways in the near future. Via Blackbeard, immortality surgery. I only had 2 ways. Now I do not see law having the guts needed to defeat Blackbeard he is not coming out that situation unscathed and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it leads to a terrible future for the heart pirates. \n\n3.Blackbeard - I know what your thinking but hear me out I can legitimately see luffy killing this monster in the future. Blackbeard is the lowest of the low scumbags a true pirate and will do anything to achieve his dreams. I do not see things ending well at all for Blackbeard once he encounters luffy especially after what luffy done to kaido. Yeah akainu was the donut maker but Blackbeard gave him the dough and luffy will make him pay for it I reckon. He used luffys brother and countless other lives to see his goals come to fruition he deserves what is coming. \n\n4. Shanks figglehorn - I dno I do think shanks will meet luffy again but I don‚Äôt see it being a happy ending for our red haired friend. Especially now that he‚Äôs officially joined the final fight for the one piece. Someone‚Äôs gotta kick his ass. \n\n5. Dracule Hawkeye mihawk - the greatest swordsman needs a fitting end and a final showdown vs roronoa zoro is a great one for this legendary man or should I say swordsman oh oh oh. \n\nOkay men and women my phones lagging like hell now so I‚Äôll leave it to you to finish this post who are your candidates for future deaths.",
