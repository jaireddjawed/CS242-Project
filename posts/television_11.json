It takes me out of the immersion a bit. \n\nThe most recent example is The Patient on FX, where serial killer Domnhall Gleason is caked in orange makeup when his character wouldn’t wear any! Same with Steve Carell he’s been locked in a basement he should look bedraggled! \n\nI know this is the job of the makeup artist to make it subtle but I feel like in some cases none is needed at all!",

        "text": "Wouldn't it be cool if there was a show that stress test your local self-defense class? Is there currently any show about that? I wrote a short version of the idea. \n\nThe Premise goes something like this:\nSelf-defense classes are often advertised as the key to personal safety and security, but how effective are they really? To answer this question, we've enlisted the help of a group of skilled Muay Thai students who will attend local self-defense classes and put them to the test.\n\nEach episode will focus on a different self-defense class, with our team of Muay Thai students attending as undercover trainees. The self-defense students and teachers will be unaware of the true purpose of their attendance, believing that they are just regular students looking to improve their self-defense skills.\n\nAs the classes progress, our team of medium skilled Muay Thai students will begin to test the effectiveness of the techniques being taught, engaging in sparring and simulated attacks to see how well the students and instructors can defend themselves. Along the way, we'll get to know the self-defense students and teachers, learning about their backgrounds and motivations for pursuing self-defense training.\n\nBut the real question is, will the self-defense classes stand up to the stress test? Will their techniques be able to repel the attacks of medium-skilled Muay Thai practitioners? And what will happen when the self-defense students and teachers find out the true nature of the show?\n\nEpisodes:\n\n\"Krav Maga\" - Our team attends a Krav Maga class, where they learn techniques designed for real-world self-defense scenarios. But will these techniques hold up under the pressure of a skilled Muay Thai attack?\n\n\"Women's Self-Defense\" - This episode focuses on a self-defense class specifically designed for women. Our team will examine the unique challenges faced by women in self-defense situations, and see if the techniques taught in class can really provide effective protection.\n\nIm putting this idea out there, hoping there already is a similar show for me to watch or that this idea would be stolen/borrowed by someone who works in that industry",

I'll give you guys a brief picture of my preference while also listing down the shows I've already seen. I'd prefer a long, ensemble cast type sitcom a la Modern Family or FRIENDS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here are the Shows I've already seen, in a Tier List of how much I liked them \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLoved them: Brooklyn Nine-Nine (My all time fav), F.R.I.E.N.D.S, Parks &amp; Recreation, Ted Lasso and New Girl  \n\n\nLiked them: How I met your Mother, Modern Family, Community \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDidn't like them: The Office (I'm sorry), The Big Bang Theory, The Good Place\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Metrics by which I judge a Sitcom are \n\n(a) Quality and Quantity of Jokes \n\n(b) Character Development and Plot \n\n(c) Heartwarming moments between characters \n\n(d) Romantic Relationships (This is why P&amp;R beats New Girl despite being far less funny imo) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe current recommendations I've gotten are Superstore and Blockbuster, any other recommendations from seasoned Sitcom watchers would be appreciated. :)",

        "text": "I honestly cant think of anybody right now but I'd probably pick 2 or 3 people who are a little younger and still have their exuberance but also plenty of talent and experience. \n\nRight off the top of my head: NO ONE from the big bang theory. that show sucks and isnt funny and none of the actors are funny I dont wanna hear it so do not bother.\n\nI'm thinking many of the core cast from The State, The Upright Citizens Brigade, and Reno 911 would be great regulars. Thomas Lennon in particular would be wonderful, as would Kerri Kenny.  The Kids In The Hall are getting up there in years and might make wonderful guests, but thats all. Some of the funnier Office people would be ok as occasional guests, particularly  Rainn Wilson. Gary Anthony Williams of course would be a fine choice as a regular or a guest. Some of the Brooklyn Nine-nine people might make fine guests, but not regulars. \n\nBut the truth is I cant think of too many young people who are good improvisors and would want to be on the show for 20 episodes each year.",
