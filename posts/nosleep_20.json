        "text": "My eyes opened, but nothing had changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could still see the dream as clearly as a moment before because, aside from the subtle transition of consciousness, my bedroom still appeared precisely the same as it had. Inky shadows blanketed most of the room, their harsh lines cast in electric blue by the blinking device in the far corner. The small space was cramped but organized as it always was, and yet somehow it had shifted, fundamentally altered by the dream. The closed door on my right side, forever a symbol of the safety of this place, no longer held any meaning in the world the dream had created.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe silence held the only clue to the shift in realities. I could no longer hear the vicious snarling from the window above my head. The enraged barking, the scraping of claws and teeth at the window's frame; all had ceased as my eyes opened. But still each sound echoed in memory, carrying knowledge that I knew, yet could not know. The two hounds, I somehow knew, were as black as the shadows before me. No beautiful creatures were these - beings not meant to be seen, existing only in the absence of light. The dream was short; the two creatures arrived only moments before I awoke, baying at the scant protection offered me by the curtained glass. Yet the sound carried with it a sense of familiarity; beasts that I somehow knew, sounds that I had heard before in silence. The creatures had been a part of the dream. But in the memory of them, I knew that they existed apart from it. In the darkness, a fearful voice suggested quietly that the sounds that had awoken me continued, had I the ears to hear them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConfronted by these unrealities, I struggled to reclaim my waking mind. In the endless moment that followed, the scrambling images and thoughts left in the wake of the dream gave way to a single, overwhelming truth. I could not move. I could not breathe. Awake I may have been, but under the weight of the shadows the dream had left upon me, I lay powerless save for my wandering eyes which, free to explore the darkness, beheld the source of my trial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe pale blue light in the corner cast shadows in all directions, the usual dark shapes of the furnishings of the room contrasting sharply against it. Yet the pattern of familiar shadows was somehow broken, the shape of the room somehow wrong. As the dream faded, my searching eyes found the shadow that was out of place, cast by nothing upon my bedroom wall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe being was tall - It could fit beneath the ceiling only because it stooped, its head held slightly to one side. The darkness of the shadow was absolute, covering the being like a cloak of black save for its face which, despite lacking eyes, seemed to hold me in a curious gaze. \"Face\" may be a misnomer - the indistinct, spiraling shadows where the being's face should have been held the appropriate shape, yet none of the reality of a true visage. The shadow stood watchfully over me, as motionless as my own body, as though it had been interrupted in its work, and waited to observe what would follow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnable to act, I watched the shadow. It lingered only briefly, though each moment seemed to stretch beyond reason. Still unmoving, the shadow simply faded away, leaving the wall unmarred with its presence. As the last traces vanished, so too did the weight that held me, and I was at last able to take a breath. The dream had now left me, and the room resumed its usual form, proof against danger. But even once the darkness had retreated before the lamp that I quickly switched on, I was unable to answer the question that gnawed at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen had the dream ended?",

        "text": "A girl from my school named Cassidy Hernandez went into the Lion's Stare Theater at four thirty PM. It was a late December day. She was never seen again. Police determined she was a runaway. Nobody close to her agreed with that theory. She had frequent and volatile disagreements with her parents. Both of them were usually absent in her life due to their work schedules.\n\nProductions held in the arena ceased a decade before my date of birth. \n\nI researched the history of the venue. The last movie screened there was a Sam Peckinpah film titled The Getaway released in 1972. Students assembled the last play performed. It was a stage version of the writer Larry McMurtry‚Äôs The Last Picture Show. \n\nHer disappearance captivated the populace. Different theories circulated everywhere. Gossip infiltrated our campus, grocery store, and every workplace water cooler for miles. I was susceptible to hearing the speculations. I needed to find out what happened to her. While I never knew her well, I always had a bit of a crush on Cassidy.\n\nThe first thing I did was pay online for the police report. \n\nRedacted paragraphs with black bars of ink blanketing them were everywhere. It ended with a footnote stating how the case was ongoing.\n\nShe was last seen wearing a magenta dress. Her father and mother denied any contention between them the evening she left. She even told them she would be back around seven for dinner. Her parents were under the assumption she was going to visit her best friend Anya. Anya later denied ever having made contact with her that day, even via text. \n\nNobody close to her was able to give authorities a definitive answer to why she was in that particular area. Everyone agreed on how she tended to take long walks to clear her head. \n\nThe police found her purple backpack hooked on the top of a street light. An investigator concluded someone had thrown the bag over the edge of a balcony. \n\nThe report stated she received roses and chocolates in class days prior. No one knew who sent them.\n\n\\*\n\nI chose to go to the auditorium in the evening. The Lion's Stare theater sat in the center of my town. I have renamed the place to prevent people from trying to explore the location.\n\nThe building was horseshoe-shaped from the outside. A real-estate developer attempted to convert it into an apartment complex. They abandoned it shortly after. This halting in the refurbishment was evident by its inconsistent color scheme.\n\nCaution tape fluttered in the wind. I was not going to risk bypassing it in broad daylight. \n\n*I will wait until nightfall,* I thought.\n\n\\*\n\nI found a stairwell exit door propped open on the north end of the building. For a second I wondered if construction contractors may have been still coming in and out. I did not see any work trucks in the vicinity, so I decided to try my luck. I walked through and secured the door behind me. I did not want to rouse suspicion should anyone walk the perimeter. I had seen security guards in places like this when I was younger and into urban exploring.\n\nI reached the main seating area and walked down the center aisle. To my surprise, some of the bulbs at the end of each step were still lit up and flickering. The inside of the theater was a metallic dark green. The hues were on everything from the upholstery to the cloth of the curtains and the wood of the stage.\n\nMy foot brushed something. I wrote it off as debris until I looked down and saw it was the tattered piece of a magenta dress. I felt my throat close. I reasoned there was no way this could be hers. I looked closer and saw it was not cut with a pair of scissors, a razor, or a knife. The strength of a man‚Äôs hand had done the damage.\n\nSix more steps down near the foot of the front row was another identical piece of fabric. I walked towards it and came across another desiccated garment. It was a trail of garb, and it led up to the platform. I walked under the scaffolding and onto the stage. I moved behind the viridian wall hangings. \n\nThe backstage area resembled a junkyard of the performing arts. Broken-down props were in alignment next to the statues. The stone figures once a part of Shakespearean tragedy stared at me.\n\nThe sound of a passageway swinging open reverberated behind me. \n\nThe beam of a flashlight became visible. \n\nI darted down into a chamber blanketed in darkness. The small staircase I took was on rollers, which almost caused me to topple over. I landed on my feet instead. I sprinted down a vestibule covered in old pictures of former directors and local stars.\n\nThere was a means of access to a completely blackened compartment. I stepped inside, closed and locked the entrance-way behind me. \n\nI was in a green room. There were dusty volumes and black &amp; white pictures of young people. Their faces had drippings of blood near their eyes. \n\nThere were Polaroid‚Äôs scattered on the ground. The letters L, R, and various numbers were on the foreheads of the children. \n\nA metal safe sat in the corner. I approached it and crouched.\n\nFootsteps outside became more and more distant. I tried to regulate my breathing and adrenaline. Whoever had been following me disappeared from the immediate area based on the sound.\n\nI checked the knob of the safe on the off-chance it was open. All I got in return was a handful of cobwebs. I looked at all the pictures and decided to try and crack the code, improbable as my chances seemed. \n\nI looked at the numbers and letters in the photographs. I took note of the individuals from the youngest to the oldest. When I had used the numbers before me, I managed to open them. It sounds crazy that anyone would leave their code out in the open. I must admit I have worked for many business owners who made the same mistake. \n\nA spider the size of my hand crawled along my forearm as I reached into the vault. I smashed it against the wall.\n\nI saw a cardboard box on the inside at the very bottom of the safe. I ripped the top apart to see what was inside.\n\nI saw a stack of leather-bound books. I picked one to flip through and discovered it was handwritten. The penmanship was exquisite. It was almost calligraphy, and I recognized it as a girl‚Äôs. There was no name anywhere on it, a fickle attempt at anonymity. \n\nI knew I had to carry the book with me because whoever locked them up did so for a reason. I had a scour the contents to find out why. \n\nI started reading a few entries at the back of the volume. They were sketches of other people's lives. Very little of the text was in the first person. Summaries of individual biographies leaped off the page. Their accomplishments, failures, love interests, jobs, and plans made for the future. The personal hell they had survived captivated me. There were also mentions of the fashion of these men and women. No design referenced seemed familiar to me.\n\nThe footsteps returned. \n\nThe door to the green room collapsed. I picked up the box. \n\nA monolithic man wearing a hollow gray wolf mask ran in and dashed me. I stood and whipped out a punch while still holding the box. It was not the greatest moment of my fighting life, but I still connected with his jaw. He stumbled back a few steps and unleashed a howl as I brought the flat of my foot against his kneecap. \n\nHis leg went in reverse enough for me to ruin his balance and send him hurtling to the floor. He did a push-up to stand again, but by then I was already racing.\n\nI ran through the threshold and out into that passageway again. It seemed to be a never-ending corridor with no exit. In the corner of my vision, I saw a grimy piano. Piles of curtains the same color as Cassidy‚Äòs dress decorated the tops of the ivories. Small holes in the ceiling allowed a thin rivulet of sunlight to shine as a beacon. It was a bittersweet reminder of the far-away world above. In my sprint, I almost tripped over a few floorboards with rusty nails that stuck out.\n\nI wandered into another chamber. I shut the door behind me, looked around, and saw an assemblage of machines. The scent of iron oxide was strong. I was in a projection room. There were two cameras. Four other connected electrical boxes pointed at the stage through a grungy porthole. \n\nI heard the same footsteps outside come closer, so I grabbed the only thing I could - a film canister. I looked at the door and prepared to swing it at the man should he approach me again. \n\n\\*\n\nThe door opened and closed. A person walked in but this figure was different from the one chasing after me.\n\nCassidy came in. She wore a tattered, dirt-covered dress. She had tangled hair.\n\nMy instincts told me to hug her. I wanted to take some kind of small victory lap at having done something the cops were unable to. I refrained and did not wish to alienate or scare her.\n\nI tried to lock my eyes on hers. She walked over to the machine. She seemed disinterested in my presence, even ignorant of my being there with her.\n\n‚ÄúIs he keeping you hostage?‚Äú\n\nShe tilted her head to the side and stared at me with a quizzical expression. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe both had AP English together two years in a row,‚Äù I said with my palms facing her.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm down here of my own free will,‚Äù she said as she flipped the latch and placed a mechanical apparatus in it. ‚ÄúSorry I don‚Äôt remember you. Trust me when I say I can‚Äôt imagine being anywhere else.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not right. You have to go back home.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI need to stay here. This is where I belong. I see you found my journals. I hope you didn‚Äôt read too many of them. They are very personal to me for obvious reasons. I‚Äôll take them off your hands now.‚Äù\n\nI gave her the box. She placed it on the shelf behind her and went back to operating the equipment. \n\n‚ÄúWhat do you do down here?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI play films for the ghosts,‚Äù she said with a smile. ‚ÄúThey are the most appreciative audience. They love being exposed to stories of real flesh and blood people, of humans like how they once were. It gives a sense of nostalgia and vicariousness. Component malfunctions and fires do occur with this setup. The celluloid is nitrate, the kind they used long before you and I were born. Those instances are minimal and I‚Äôve got plenty of extinguishers. This job is very complicated, but it‚Äôs important, even with the dangers of the arc lamps.‚Äù\n\nI looked out the window at the countless verdurous rows of vacant seats. My blood pressure rose. \n\n‚ÄúNo one is down here but you, me, and whatever psychopathic hillbilly I saw back there,\" I said. \"Everyone's worried about you. They deserve to know you're alive. Take my hand and let me walk you out.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo,\" she said as she turned around and pointed to a corner. My eyes followed her direction, and I saw a ventilation duct. \n\n‚ÄúI would leave that way if I were you,\" she continued. \"The man you‚Äôre referring to is Kobold. He is my protector. He will kill you if he finds you in here with me. Leaving is your best chance.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCome with me,‚Äù I said.\n\nThe door came down with a thundering crash, and the same masked shadow barged in. \n\nHe did not lay eyes on Cassidy at all, but instead made a direct path toward me. I scrambled towards the duct and managed to squeeze into it. \n\nI heard the massive man pound his fist against the walls. The reverberations beat on my ear drums. I kept a hurried pace down the narrow channel until I wound up on the street outside, where I dashed as far away as I could. \n\n\\*\n\nI told both the police and my parents everything I knew. My father and mother claimed I should not tell Cassidy‚Äôs family. They believed it might give them a false sense of hope regarding her disappearance. I interpreted this advice later on as how even my folks did not believe my part of the story.\n\nThe response of law enforcement was a bit more serious, at least on the surface. They searched the building, or so they alleged. They did not find anything. \n\nI never saw Cassidy again, and neither did anyone else as far as I know. \n\nI always sit back late at night and think about what could have happened if I stayed there.",

        "text": "When I was younger, I used to work as a child psychiatrist. I was new, a fresh graduate straight out of college, and eager to start a new career.   \n\n\nI found a job fairly easily, as I started working at a children's hospital. I never bothered reading reviews about this specific hospital, because it had been constantly praised by my professors, and was the place where the majority of people with my degree dived into and spent most of their lives in. We had no other hospital in the area, as I lived in a rural town in the middle of nowhere, so I had no choice but to apply there.   \n\n\nThe interview process was odd, to say the least. The atmosphere was tense in the room. The interviewer looked nervous as I was handed a waiver, which I quickly signed without reading, and I was hired on the spot. I think they were very short staffed, as I had started working there the next day.   \n\n\nMy first day, as I thought at that time, was very unusual. I was introduced to my coworkers, and I took a short tour around the hospital. It felt surreal, looking at the jail like rooms with solid white walls, and hearing children cry all around me. My first patient was a small girl with anxiety named Anne, who was about 5 years old. Her parents were happy to work with me and explained her situation, while the girl looked at me with awe. We went to a room on the 3rd floor of the hospital, which was colorfully decorated, and I started to talk to her to try and get to know her more.   \n\n\n\"Hello!\" I said to the small girl, putting on a fake smile, \"How are you today?\"   \n\n\nThe girl looked at me blankly, \"Good.\"   \n\n\nI started to gather my supplies, a piece of paper and a pen, and started writing. She stares at my paper, and reaches her hand towards it. Thinking nothing of it, I hand her one, and a few coloring pencils that she could draw with. After a brief minute or so, I peer over at her drawing, and ask her to show it to me.   \n\n\n\"What did you draw?\" I curiously ask, pointing to one of the figures in the painting.   \n\n\nAnne looked at me and whispered \"The creepy man.\" I look at her with worry, as she starts to tear up. She continues, \"He has big teeth that are sharp. He always finds me and my friends at my school, and always gives us a smile.\"   \n\n\nI looked at the drawing, which appears to be a giant shadowy figure with red eyes, and a creepy smile. Its fingers were elongated and thick, with dripping blood next to it.The other two people in the drawing was what I assumed to be Anne and her friends, crying and screaming for help.   \n\n\nI quickly dismiss Anne and rush to Crystal, one of my coworkers, and tell her about what happened. She looks at me in confusion, and then laughs.   \n\n\n\"That's normal here. Have you seen our reviews? We're known for this stuff.\"   \n\n\nI thank her and walk away, pondering over her answer. I decide to take a small break by walking around the hospital's garden area, which was full of the most beautiful trees and herbs. As I am walking, I notice a figure come towards me, but I just ignore it and continue walking. Eventually, 15 minutes pass and my break is now over. I walk back into the hospital, feeling dreadful, and wary of what's to come.   \n\n\nMy second (and last) patient was a teenager, named Chris, whom I learned was very hyper and had anger issues. I chat to his parents and admit him into the room. I take out my supplies again, this time placing them next to my patient. I ask him a few questions, and then prompt him to start drawing.   \n\n\n\"What do I draw about?\" Chris says, not able to contain his joy. I think for a moment, before saying my response.   \n\n\n\"Well, anything you'd like.\" I say cheerfully.   \n\n\nHe starts to draw. After a few minutes of him drawing, he sits up and shows it to me. I get chills down my spine as he starts to ramble on about his drawing. I notice another figure in the drawing and point it out.   \n\n\n\"What's that?\" I say to Chris, as he slowly adjusts his eyes towards me.   \n\n\n\"I don't know.\" Chris says.   \n\n\nHis response startled me. I try to think of any ways to ask him about it, when a sudden ringing fills my ears. I scream out in pain as Chris continues to stare at me, blankly.   \n\n\nI woke up in the nurse's office, strapped to a chair. I get approached by a nurse, who asks me a few questions, then tells me I can go home. I get a horrible feeling, but I listen to the nurse, and head out.   \n\n\nI felt very nauseous about the whole day, and just wanted some rest. So, I decided to ignore my gut feeling, and try going home. I get into my car and start driving. A figure appears into the backseat and scares me. My heart is beating faster in my chest, as I start to pull over and inspect my car. I frantically check, but nothing seemed to be there. Just as I was turning around to continue driving, a sharp hand pulled my shoulder. I start to cry out in pain, but the figure simply covers my mouth.  \n I bite the monster's hand as hard as I can, which makes it retreat a little bit, and I started to run away, abandoning my car.   \n\n\nI felt better after running for a few minutes and not seeing it around. I enter my home, and desperately climb into bed. My heart continued to pound as I started to sleep.   \n\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat. I look around my room, and noticed a figure staring at me in the corner. I get out of bed, slowly crawling out in order not to alert the figure. I grab the nearest thing, which was my water bottle, and hurl it towards the monster. It screeched as it continues beating him with my bare hands.  \n Its sharp fingers began to pierce my cheek, making me reel in pain. It began to reach out towards my legs, but it stopped when I started to hurl everything on my table towards it.   \n\n\nI heard an ear piercing sound, and passed out.  \n After a few minutes, I started to gain consciousness, and began to turn the light on and look at what I had done. I felt pure horror as I saw blood all ove the room, all over my walls. I discovered a mangled corpse of what was once the monster, smiling. I stare at it in shock, unable to move my body. My thoughts were racing, and I couldn't do anything but stare. I quickly grab some bags and clean it up, making sure that I dont touch the creature with my hands. I wash it off, and decide to try to sleep, because I had work the next day.   \n\n\nI haven't been the same since this incident happened. I am no longer a psychiatrist, as having constant paranoia and low self esteem caused me to quit my job at the hospital. Looking back now, I kind of regret ever getting that degree. Nowadays, I work at a retail job, for significantly less money, but it's the only thing that keeps me sane. I sometimes see the monster in the corner of my eye, waiting for someone else, someone naive, to prey on.   \n\n\nStay safe, everyone.",

        "text": "When I was a kid, there was a time when I had constant nightmares. Monsters, aliens, evil spies, zombies - I dreamed every single bad thing my adolescent brain could come up with. I remember asking my mom why this was happening, and she told me that it‚Äôs quite normal to have a ‚Äònightmare phase‚Äô when you‚Äôre growing up. I remember how that time in my life felt endless, being anxious about going to sleep every night, and waking up scared most mornings. Turns out, though, my mom was right - it did end up being just a phase. What felt like eternity was probably closer to six months. The bad dreams slowly became more sparse, until becoming a rare occurrence. Later I looked it up, and the frequency of nightmares reach a peak between the ages of three and six. I was probably closer to six when this all happened, seeing as how I remember it so vividly.\n\nAs I grew up, the nightmares became less and less frequent, and when I did get them, they started to manifest real-life problems, instead of monsters and aliens. In my dreams I‚Äôd lose my wallet, sleep in from job interviews, have my laptop break, and the like. Sometimes I would miss the nightmares of my childhood, when they were an escape from the real world, instead of a manifestation of its worst attributes.\n\nAnyway, there was one dream that stayed with me through the years. During that nightmare phase, I dreamed of a monster invisible to all the grown-ups. In it, I would be hanging out in my room, playing with toys. Suddenly, I would sense something coming after me, in that weird dreamy way where you just *know* something. Scared, I‚Äôd run to my sister‚Äôs room and ask her to help me. She would yell at me to stop bothering her. She didn‚Äôt believe me. I‚Äôd run downstairs to the living room, where I‚Äôd find my parents drinking coffee and reading newspapers. I would tell them that something is coming after me, something horrible, and I need help. I was screaming and jumping around, trying to do anything to get them to help me. But they wouldn‚Äôt listen. My parents would tell me that everything is fine, and not to make such a big deal about this. Neither of them even looked up from their newspapers. I was afraid for my life, and no one believed me. \n\nI could feel the thing entering the top floor, coming for me, coming to *take* me. In sheer panic I‚Äôd run to the bathroom at the other side of our house and lock the door. I could hear the thing coming closer as I screamed for help, but to no avail. Everyone ignored what was happening to me. The thing reached the bathroom door and started to smash it with its huge, deformed appendages. Each hit from its greasy flesh cracked the door slightly more than the last, tearing holes  as pieces of wood seemed to explode in all directions. I would cry, my eyes so welled up that I could barely see, resigned to die. There was no escape, and nobody was coming to help me. That‚Äôs when I would wake up, with that feeling still encompassing my whole body. \n\nI still have this dream thirty years later. Not as often, of course, but maybe once or twice a year. As the years passed, the dream tenderized, and the potency of its dread faded. It became a routine, a film you‚Äôve seen a thousand times over.\n\nMy son recently turned five, and he has been seeing more and more nightmares. I told him all about the nightmare phase, how I‚Äôd had it as well, and how it would end soon enough. I told him the nightmares I had as a kid mostly seemed silly now that I was older, and that would happen to him as well. I reminded him that monsters aren‚Äôt real, and even if they were, I would protect him and kick their asses. He didn‚Äôt completely understand the fact that monsters aren‚Äôt real, but instead he was very enthusiastic about me fighting them off with my legendary jiu-jitsu and karate moves - his idea. Dads really are superheroes to their kids, and I still hope to be one.\n\nThree days ago he had gotten pretty tired during the day, so we put him out for an afternoon nap. He seemed to fall asleep quickly. \n\nAfter a while, as e and my wife sat in the living room with our phones in hand, he ran down the stairs, clearly frightened. His pajamas were soaked in sweat, and his eyes were wide. He told me there was a monster coming after him, that he needed me to come and kick its butt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a nightmare‚Äù, I told him, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no monster, but I‚Äôll check your bedroom closets later if you'd like.‚Äù He screamed ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù There‚Äôs a monster here NOW coming AFTER ME!!‚Äù \n\nWhen he got like this, it was best to ignore the screaming. I didn‚Äôt want there to be a precedent that a tantrum would get him whatever he wanted, so I just repeated what I said; that it‚Äôs just a nightmare, and that I‚Äôll help him later if he calms down. He screamed for his mom, who only told him to do as his I had said. Promptly, our son ran into the bathroom and locked himself in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll calm down in there and come out soon enough‚Äù I told my wife. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope these nightmares pass soon, I bet it‚Äôs making his brain more wired up than it already is. It's a crazy time being a kid.‚Äù\n\nAfter about ten minutes he still hadn‚Äôt come out of the bathroom. I called out to him but there was no answer. I assumed the tantrum had evolved into the silent treatment. I walked up to the bathroom door and knocked. Still no answer, not even a breath. I called out again with a firm tone telling him that it‚Äôs time to come out. Complete silence. My wife got up and joined me at the door. We waited for a few moments more, and nothing. \n\nI started to get scared. What if he had fallen down and hit his head? All of the things that could be wrong started to crowd my mind. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to force the door if you‚Äôre not coming out, okay? But then we‚Äôll take the cost of the repairs out of your allowance.‚Äù I called out, trying to incentivize him to open the door. My wife started to get panicky as well. He must‚Äôve been in there for fifteen minutes or more now. ‚ÄúOkay buddy STAND BACK, I‚Äôm going to open the door now.‚Äù I didn't have words to help me anymore. After another silent moment, hoping this would just end, I took a step back and threw my elbow into the door, slightly cracking the wooden frame. My wife jumped, but didn√§t try to stop me. The second time I hit the door even harder, but it still wouldn‚Äôt budge. I thought, fuck it, I‚Äôll just break the whole thing. I'd rather pay for a new door than have something happen to my son - I'm a good dad. Aiming for the space right next to the handle and lock, I kicked the door open, smashing parts of the frame with it. Walking in, we both inspected the small bathroom. It was empty.\n\nSoon the police came and searched the house, finding nothing. Right now they're sweeping the whole county, and I‚Äôm sure if you‚Äôre a resident you by now know which one. The story hasn‚Äôt left the news for five minutes. There‚Äôs no trace of forced entry, no marks of any kind to show him leaving. There‚Äôs no window in the bathroom, and his shoes and all were still at our house. Even with all that, the bathroom door only locks from the inside. It‚Äôs like he disappeared into thin air. It‚Äôs been over 72 hours, so the chances of him being found alive are decreasing. Now the police are starting to suspect us as well. How could we do that? Do something to our own son? What the fuck would all this benefit? We're good parents, for fuck's sake. My wife‚Äôs a wreck. I‚Äôve barely slept, but last night sheer exhaustion commanded me to blackout for a few hours. \n\nWhen I fell aslepp, I dreamed the same dream I‚Äôd always had, of the monster no one but me could hear and see. The dream progressed exactly as it always does, but instead of me being my adolescent self, I was in the living room, sitting next to my wife. Our son came down the stairs, frightened. He told us he‚Äôs scared of a monster that‚Äôs coming out to get him. I promptly told him to calm down, that I'll come and check his room later. He ran to the bathroom and locked himself in. A few moments later, I hear a horrid gurgling sound from upstairs. The sound started to increae in volume, accompanied by loud steps. I was frozen in fear.\n\nA huge thing with multiple thick appendages emerged from the stairwell. The thing's body had portions of... people emerging from its thick skin. Children, I realized from the small size of the body parts, were melded into the creature, in ragged, torn up ways. Bulging, white eyes popped up in a  crude circle near the top, and rows of baby teeth ejected from the long appendages. Small bones protruded in jagged formations as puss leaked from intermittent holes. Its many eyes turned to look at me, and for a moment they squinted in unison. It turned away and started to walk, thrumping its disgusting body in irregular movements.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt move or say anything as it approached the bathroom. I couldn‚Äôt get up as it started to smash the door into pieces. I couldn‚Äôt say sorry when I saw my son‚Äôs face through the cracks in the door.\n\nSheer terror woke me up. I tried to explain to my wife that I saw it, I saw the thing that took our son. She doesn‚Äôt believe me, and I highly doubt the police would either. I got a bottle of expired sleeping pills, to try and get a longer sleep in. I have to go back there - I have to find out if there‚Äôs something I can do. I don‚Äôt know how this works - whether the thing can kill me in the dream - so I‚Äôm leaving this text as some sort of proof of what I‚Äôm about to attempt, and what led me to this. Maybe I won't even have the dream, but I sure as fuck hope I do. It's the only thing I can do. I might be the only one who can get back there, and I don‚Äôt know what will happen. After posting this I‚Äôm taking a handful of pills to combat the amount of adrenaline in my body. I need to get to sleep and stay asleep for as long as I can. Maybe I won't wake up, but I hope to find my son. I promised him I'd kick any and all monster butt, and that's what I'm going to do. Wish me luck.",

        "text": "Not sure where else to turn. My friends don't believe me. Law enforcement ain't an option... they'd have me committed or lock me up for a crime I didn't commit. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's start at the beginning:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm a photographer. Or at least I want to be. I found a great DSLR and lens package for cheap. Have some lights I bought off Amazon for product photography and zoom calls. I assisted and worked the second camera for a few wedding shoots. I was determined to strike out on my own and figure out if I could sustain myself on art alone. That's why I was ecstatic when Anne called and asked if I had anything booked a few weeks before Christmas. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"I'm in. What's the job?\" She said, \"I already have a second photographer but can I rent your camera? $100. One day.\"   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell, shit. I wanted to say you can have the camera for free as long as I get to shoot. But money's money. And for the price I paid for the camera, this fee goes a long way to paying it off. Reluctantly I agreed. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe day comes and goes without incident. Then about a week later I get a barrage of urgent texts asking if I wiped the CF card. As it turns out I haven't. Good thing too because Anne's files were corrupted and she needed to re-copy them. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Sure. No problem.\" I offer to copy the files and upload them to dropbox. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe transfer went fine. I messaged Anne that the files were ready. And I mentioned how cool it was that she did a horror photoshoot. Not my taste but cool none the less. She messaged back, \"Dude, it wasn't a horror shoot. It's a Christmas card. Your janky gear totally fucked this job. Thanks for nothing.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExcuse me? I messaged her back and still haven't heard back. So, yay for networking. Great now I know why this kit was so cheap. It's broken. Getting off to a great start here. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI reformat the CF card and the images are still there. It's hard to describe. Some of Anne's cheery holiday shoot are there but then, it must of overwritten something else, but some truly haunting... visual aberrations. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter trying endlessly to format the card I simply gave up and tossed it into a drawer. I'd talk to my art school buddy after the holidays and see if there was some software that could salvage the card. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nChristmas Eve I was relating the situation to some family and my cousin Phoebe wanted to see the pictures. I explained there's really nothing there. Just corrupted data that looks weird. But she asked so I pulled them up on my phone and she flips through them. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"I might be crazy but this looks like a graveyard.\" She flips through some more, \"...and you see here. That's a finger. Maybe a ring. What is that a window?\" What the hell is she talking about? We go through the photos one by one and she was right. It actually does look like a grave. It does look like a finger and a hand. A girls hand? I don't know about a ring, but there's something on her hand. String? String tied around her finger. Plastic? It's impossible to tell. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"You might consider showing this to the police.\" \"Why?\" \"It looks like someone's being killed and it looks like someone took pictures of it. Where did you get this camera?\" \"Friend of a friend. Said they bought it used and didn't need it anymore.\" \"Maybe send them a message and poke around.\" \"Poke around and what? Ask for my money back? Casually ask if the previous owner was murdered?\" \"Or did the previous owner murder someone?\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJump ahead to New Years Eve and me and a few friends get together. After a few drinks it's suggested we go to a party. Every fiber of my body wanted to do nothing more than cozy up with some popcorn and watch the Twilight Zone marathon on SyFY. I was summarily outvoted. In retrospect I really wish I hadn't gone. \n\nThis party was way more raging than our cozy group anticipated. We all split up. I spotted my friend Vic who I bought the camera from. My energy was high from the redbulls and vodka so I cornered him and enthusiastically rambled about how he sold me either a broken normal camera or a working ghost camera. He was naturally confused. I think mostly to get rid of me he turned me around and pointed across the room. \"See the skinny dude in the hoody who looks like he's rolling face.\" \"Yeah\" \"That's, Drift.\" \"Drift?\" \"Yeah, like Drifter.\" \"What's his real name?\" \"Who knows. But he's who I got the camera from. I bought it for the same price I sold it to you. You have questions about the camera. See him.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDrifter. Jesus. Who advertises they're a drifter? I did not want to talk to this dude. But I made my way to that side of the party. He was dancing with a girl who seemed as out of it as he was. It wasn't like they were dancing together, more like two pieces of floating driftwood that occasionally bumped into each other. Maybe that's what Drifter meant. Driftwood. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext thing I know I'm right next to him. \"Hey, are you Drifter?\" \"Yeah. What do you need?\" \"What do you got?\" I'm not kidding. I actually asked that. In fairness I was drunk. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Moon rocks. 45.\" \"I want to talk about cameras.\" He looked at me like, huh. Keeping in mind this guy is dancing is like his body is made out of broken slinky and he's looking at me like I'm weird.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"No, no. I have a camera. You sold it to my friend.\" \"Okay?\" \"I just wanted to ask where you got it from. There's some pictures on it, might belong to the owner.\" \"Nah, it's good. Just delete it.\" \"That's the problem. I can't. Maybe I can show you.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe gave me the biggest bummer look. Right on cue the song changed, his 'friend' wandered away. He motioned for me to follow him. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe walked out onto the back porch. It was way more quiet and the fresh air felt amazing. The porch was crowded with smokers. Drift lit a smoke of his own and kinda snapped out of his trance. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI started, \"Yeah man. You sold a camera to my friend Vic. I just  had some questions.\" He nodded like he knew what I was talking about. \"I just wanted to know where you got it from.\" \"My friends roommate got it from somewhere, man. I don't know. Traded it for some... you know and. I thought it'd be cool to have a camera. But I didn't really need it. Sold it to Vic. End of story.\" \"Right on. So you don't actually know who it belonged to?\" \"Nope. You said there were some pictures.\" I nodded, pulled out my phone. \"It's not anything. Probably glitching out. Problem is I can't delete them. Here take a look.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI handed the phone over and when Drift took it, I noticed his fingernails are painted, chipped purple. And he has this really funky plastic fish ring on his finger. It like instantly sparked that it's his hand in the photo. It's so obviously his hand. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe flipped through some of the photos. Handed the phone back. \"Hey man I don't know. Usually in a deal like this all sales are final, know what I mean. No guarantees. But look gimme your number and if I stumble across that dude maybe he can help you fix it.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I gave him my number and that was that. Except, that wasn't that. A few nights ago I get a text. Drift says he's at the bar, with the guy. I should swing by, hang out... and bring the camera. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, you're gonna think I'm exaggerating here. I'm not an idiot. Okay? I had one thought and one thought only. The camera is stolen. These guys are scammers. They're either going to rob me there or rob me somewhere else or get enough information to rob me later. This is a very important piece of information I left out. I didn't leave it out to deceive you, but context is critical for this to make sense and help you understand why I'm so afraid. There wasn't just a photo of a graveyard and a finger there was a photo of a woman, she looked terrified. And in the graveyard there is a grave and the name on the grave is Angela Ackerman. She's an NYU graduate student who disappeared about two years ago. Her body was found in dump about two weeks after she went missing. I have a feeling these guys are connected to it. And nobody I've talked to believes me or feels there's a case. Without proof. The day after I gave Drift my number I started preparing for this. I wrote everything I know down in a long unsent email. When I got the text I messaged my close friend group and said what I thought was about to go down. If this all turns out to be nothing, then I'm the boy who cried wolf. But I have a feeling there's a young woman out there who in some way or shape or form needs my help. I 100% understood the risks of going to this meeting. I wasn't going to threaten, accuse or act violent. This was to be a fact finding mission. An investigation. The only truths about me that they were going to learn where what I wanted them to know. It's easy to play the naive artist and let them think they're prying hard to get information out of me. I consciously put the name Angela Ackerman out of my brain and was just to act like a naive camera geek asking two skeezy drug dealers for tech support. Nothing weird about that. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI got to the bar right on time. It was fine. A little div-y but nothing wrong with a good dive bar. Bartender seemed chill, hand full of solo drinkers at the bar. No major red flags. \n\nBack in the corner a pretty boisterous crew, couple guys and girls and Drift. Laughing talking. \n\nThe music was loud. Like too loud to have a conversation so everyone shouts. Broken ear drum loud. I stopped first at the bar. Ordered an IPA. Paid in cash. \n\nWalked up to the table. Drift stands up and says hey everybody this is Vic's friend. Drift introduced me to the table; Nick, Aaron, Sean, Liz and Maddie. Nick is who traded the camera to Drift who sold it to Vic who sold it to me. I pulled up a chair. Nick asked to see the camera. Turned it on, knew what he was doing. Snapped a few photos. Said he heard it had a bad CF card. Suggested formatting it again, like duh, scrolled through the pictures. Didn't react in any special way. Said it was probably just a messed up card and to replace it. Happens all the time. Cards go bad. Yeah they do. Sometimes people go bad too is what I was thinking. He hands the camera back. Maddie asked to take a look at it. And the camera went around the table, everyone offering their amateur opinions. Then I kid you not. Liz says it reminds her of Angela's. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell that got a reaction. \"Who's Angela?\" I ask. \"She's a friend of ours. It's a bummer she's not here, she'd probably know what the problem is.\" And that was that. We spent the next hour getting to know each other having drinks. Maddie, Liz and Nick live together. Drifter is between jobs, like me I said. Aaron is visiting for the holidays and Sean... Sean didn't say much. I think he's a DJ. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI stepped away to use the bathroom. Once I locked the door I made sure the tascam recorder in my pocket was still on. I hit the button to make a chapter break. Still has plenty of battery life. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI get back to the table and see Nick and Drift are gone. They went to smoke a joint in the alley. I said I had to take off anyway. Said goodbye and headed out on the street. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was parked a few blocks away. On my way I passed the alley and saw the guys. I held up my hand and headed their way. This is where the hairs on my neck started to rise. This dive bar, charming as it is is in a mostly run down part of town. Not a lot of light in this alley and no cameras. None that I could see. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI approached the fellas. Said I had to go and thanked them for a good time. Drift offered me a smoke. I said no, had to drive and all that, beside weed makes me paranoid. I turned to head back down the alley. Nick called out, \"Hey, what are you going to do?\" I looked back, huh?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"With the camera? If it's a bad CF card it can be replaced. If it's a bad CF reader it might be bricked. What are you thinking?\" \"Well, I can't afford a whole new camera so I'll get a new card.\" \"Yeah, well I feel bad. If you want to leave it with me I know a guy who can take a look at it.\" \"Nah, I'll take my chances. Thanks.\" \"Yo, well wait. Let me take one more look at it.\" \"I'm good, thanks.\" \"No seriously. It'll just take a second.\" \"What's the problem. I won't break it, not worse than it already is. I promise.\" Alright, slick. \"Cool.\" I pull the camera out and hand it to him. He looks at it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Yeah, I don't think I can in good consciousness let you have this camera.\" \"What are you talking about.\" \"It wouldn't be right.\" \"Yeah, I payed for it.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDrift steps towards me. \"He said he can't let you have it.\" \"Fine take it. Gimme my money back.\" \"Money? I didn't sell you anything. Vic has your money. Talk to him.\" \"What the hell man. Totally uncool.\" \"Maybe next time don't buy stolen shit.\" \"Who said it was stolen? I didn't know it was stolen.\" \"Yeah but now you do. So if you think about calling the cops remember that important detail. In fact for all we know you stole it and now we're returning it to the rightful owner.\" \"So you're just going to rob me?\" \"No, if we were robbing you, you'd know. We're just confiscating ill gotten goods. So, just fuck off and forget any of this ever happened.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe adrenaline kicked in and I lunged for Nick grabbing the camera. He kicked me right in the gut sending me tumbling across the alley and the camera right in the middle. Nick picked up the camera and Drift next to him. They turned to walk away. The kick didn't hurt as much as the tumble on the concrete. \"Hey, stop. The camera's mine.\" They turned towards me... \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe camera revved to life. I assume because Nick was holding the shutter button. I think it it takes pictures in 30 shot bursts or something. But this was like 1,000 shot burst mode. It was so loud I totally didn't hear the car coming. The flash went off like a fireworks display, rapid fire, strobe light... blinding them both. And with the most gut sickening thud I've ever heard... The car smashed into the Drift and Nick. It was a Dodge Charger and must have been going at least 45-50. The bodies were tossed like bowling pins and the car crashed into the side of a brick garage. The driver  and passenger stumbled out and started screaming.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nScreaming was all I heard as I grabbed the camera and sprinted for my life down the alley. I heard the screaming the whole drive home and I heard the screaming as I got home and locked the door and I heard the screaming as I stepped into a scolding hot shower and I heard the screaming right until I turned the water off. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow I was more calm. There was a car accident. Unknown if the Nick or Drift survived. The driver and passenger seemed to be okay. Probably a good chance the Charger was totaled. The garage would require repairing. As far as anyone else at the bar knew I left 10-20 minutes prior to the accident. I didn't assault anyone. In fact they assaulted me and tried to rob me. Steal my camera.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor all intensive purposes, I was never there. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToweled off and relaxed, I examined the camera. It was in bad shape. Scratched, dented, screen cracked, lens broken, flash chipped. I popped out the CF card. Slipped it into the reader attached to the laptop. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI couldn't believe what I saw. I'd call it a miracle if it weren't so sinister; All the old photos were gone. Now there's a new set of horrific images, written over. A few clear shots of Nick and Drift getting flattened by the Charger and a whole new batch of cryptic images. But there is one photo, clearer than the rest. A grave stone with the name Angela Ackerman etched into it. In loving memory of our daughter Angela. Our angel. Our angel? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI think this camera killed and I have every reason it wants to kill again and it wants me to help. Is Angela an unrested spirit? A devil or avenging angel. I just don't know.",

        "text": "I still can't believe this happened, but I wanted to share my story with the world. It might help me feel better. I had just moved into a new house near a forest, and I had been living there for about a month. I love taking daily walks in the forest, it was so peaceful and relaxing for me. The area wasn't completely isolated, there were other houses nearby and I had made friends with a few of the people who lived there.\n\nOne day, while on one of my walks, I stumbled upon an old shed. It was quite rundown and looked like it hadn't been opened in years. My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to see what was inside, hoping there was something valuable. I opened the door and walked inside, but to my disappointment, there was nothing valuable inside. Just some old tools and a few cobwebs, I was about to leave the shed when I noticed something odd. The door that I had come trough was now gone. In its place was a completely different door. I was so confused and scared, but again, my curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to see what was on the other side.\n\nI stepped trough the door, and what I saw was beyond anything I could have ever imagined. It was like I had entered another dimension. The sky was purple, and the trees were made of some kind of crystal. The ground was covered in some sort of thick fog, and I couldn't see more than a few feet in front of me. I started to feel really scared, like I was in a nightmare. But then I heard something. It was a low growling, coming from the direction I was headed. I knew I had to get out of here as fast as possible, but I had no idea how to get back to where I came from.\n\nI started running, hoping to find my way back, but the growling got louder and closer. Suddenly, I saw a figure emerging from the fog. It was a monster, with red eyes and very sharp claws. I screamed and tried to run, but it was too fast. It caught up to me and grabbed me with its claws. I felt a sharp pain, and then everything went black.\n\nwhen I woke up, I was back in the original shed, lying on the floor of the shed. I was so relieved to be back, but I was also really scared. I had no idea how I got back, or what that monster was. I went straight to my house and locked the doors. I stayed there for days, too scared to go outside.\n\nI had to share this with the world, because I needed to talk about what happened. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true. I still have scars from the claws. I don't know what that monster was, or where that other place was, but I never want to go back there again. I never walk in the forest anymore, and I've warned my friends to stay away from that old shed.",

        "text": "      Mere words can‚Äôt describe how unbelievably grotesque the butchering of the Styles family was. I was unfortunate enough to be among the first few officers to the scene. My name is Quinn. Officer James Quinn. Welcome to the night that legend‚Ä¶became reality. \n      Growing up in Dixon, you hear all kinds of tall tales and ghost stories. Most of which are just meant to keep the children from venturing into the woods at night. But there‚Äôs one legend that seems to hold a grip on this town. One that‚Äôs been told since even my grandparents were children. And that‚Äôs the legend of the woodsman. \n       The legend of the woodsman was birthed from the tragedy of a man named Lawrence Davies, a local lumber yard worker who went mad after losing his wife and daughter. It‚Äôs said that the pain was too much for the lumberjack to cope with and seeing other happy families together and smiling would enrage him. For all he could see is what was taken from him. So to soothe his burning rage he vanished into the woods vowing never to return. \n      For months nobody had seen or heard from Mr. Davies. Many people had claimed to see smoke billowing from a small log cabin barely big enough to be a hunting shack, but nobody had dared to approach it. That is until October 26th, 1931. A family of 3, a father, mother, and a daughter, were found brutally slaughtered about 500ft from the cabin. The fathers head was nearly split in half with what could only have been a dull wood splitting axe. The mother had a wife gash across her back from being struck while trying to escape with their daughter in her arms. And the daughter‚Ä¶ that poor little girl‚Ä¶ trapped under her mothers lifeless body, was completely decapitated. Her head nowhere to be found. Until the search party found the cabin. \n      There, in front of the cabin, hanging from a drying rack next to a few gutter rabbits, was the little girls head. The party burst through the door of the cabin to find Lawrence sleeping on a makeshift bed made out of logs and animal hides. Without warning they starting beating and pounding Mr. Davies until he was barely recognizable. Beaten, bruised, and bloody, they dragged him out of the cabin and threw him to the ground as half of them started to build a pyre. He was to burn for the sins he committed. No arrest. No trial. No judge. Just execution. After the pyre was constructed and Lawrence was tied up to it, they asked him if he had anything to say, expecting a confession of guilt. The only thing to escape his mouth tho? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll regret this‚Ä¶ all of you‚Ä¶ and your kin.‚Äù They lit the pyre. Not one sound of pain came from Lawrence Davies. It was as if something else had taken over. After a few minutes of burning the ropes binding Lawrence snapped. His corpse hit the ground with a sickening thud. All his hair had been burned off. His nose gone and his mouth melted shut. It was over. \n       Over the years, there have been a multitude of claims from old timers and young teens claiming to have seen an axe wielding man with no hair, no nose, and no mouth traipsing through the woods, but never anything like the scene before me. A fathers head split in half. A mother with a wide gash across her back. And a decapitated child. The Styles family were good people and didn‚Äôt deserve this. I managed to break my gaze and look up. There, about 500ft from this little clearing, I saw him. The Woodsman.",

        "text": "Greetings. If you are reading this, then it means that the sigils are working as they should and, in theory, last throughout the night. It's the first time I used high level reverse warding since I've been sent back, and my memory is still a little fuzzy from before. If I didn't mess up, this should give me time to at least somewhat rest and write down my message. I will not tell you who or where I am, lest my precautions would be for naught, but you can address me as Z. What I can tell you however is that I am currently on the run from God.\n\nWhy, you may ask? Why would God be trying to catch me? What makes me so special for Him to find me and drag me back to heaven? See, this is the funny thing. I am not special. I died too early. Turns out, when you stalk around a bunch of demon worshipers, they tend to be a little... how should I put this... stabby. In hindsight, I should've been more careful, checking before entering their cave to see if they have a way to bypass my talismans, but I digress. What is important to know is that I have been killed and went to heaven. \n\nAt first, I was glad. All my years working for the Vatican have finally paid off. I was finally in His goodwill and all that remained is for me to achieve everlasting peace. To be fair, you could argue that they didn't lie about that part. You could also argue that the Devil doesn't lie about his deals either. What actually happened is that when I arrived at the gates of heaven, I have been assigned an angel. It was standard procedure they said. Check out on my previous deeds to see if I have sinned, a short interview, all that good stuff. The angel took me and I found myself in a large room of pure brilliance, filled with heavenly light. I sat down on what was easily the comfiest couch I ever sat on and began to talk with him. You'd think that being in the presence of God's servant would give me a sense of calm, but honestly, after a while, I was beginning to feel worried. The angel was all smiles and he was being very friendly, even cracking a few jokes in between taking notes, but I couldn't help but notice his eyes. Behind all the radiance and his golden colored irises, there was nothing. No... There was something. Malice. The same malice I saw when I confronted demons on Earth. I pretended not to observe, but he might've realized it.\n\nWhen the interview was finished, another angel came and took a gander at the notes my interviewer took. His face betrayed a slight confusion, looking both at me and the notes for a few times before the angel at the desk simply said \"he is not ready\". Shrugging, the second angel lead me to another room. If the interview room was supposed to give you a sense of serenity and purity, the room I now found myself in was the complete opposite: cramped, with almost no light present in the room, with a single chair in the middle of it. The white marble walls now looked more like the white you'd see in an insane asylum rather than a place of purity. The chair was of red and black stone, more akin to something you'd see in hell rather than heaven. I was then told to sit on it with a deep growl, replacing the typical heavenly voice of an angel, all the previous pretense of being nice having disappeared. I demanded to know what was the meaning of this. How can I, someone that has served God all these years, be treated in such a way. The angel just laughed and pushed me onto the chair. After sitting, I noticed I couldn't get up from it even if I tried. He told me not to struggle too much. He then placed a hand on the top of my head. I suddenly began feeling like my being was invaded with a powerful energy. I felt the energy going to my legs and saw myself being dissolved, the energy filling me like an empty vessel, climbing towards my head. As I kept disappearing, the angel told me: \"If you really want to know what is going on, human, I will tell you. You will still forget what has happened here, but I always enjoy telling your kind the truth before being sent back. That brief moment of terror is simply... divine. Right now, you are unfit to remain here and serve your final purpose, thus, I am sending you to earth to fully finish your brief lifespan. But don't worry,\" he began smiling more and more, \"you will come right back here. The soul of an exorcist is highly sought after, especially by our Father\". As only my head remained when he finished talking, I asked him what was this final purpose he spoke of. He grinned and uttered only one word: \"consumption\".\n\nWith that, I woke up back in my body, deep in a dark forest at night. The stars and the moon were hidden behind thick, gray clouds, small drops of rain hitting my face. My mind was a bit blurry, but I still remembered what he has told me. I am not sure why I still remembered, but it might have been because the demon wards I put in my mind before confronting the cultists could have interfered with the angelic magic. Immediately after waking up, feeling like I stepped out from my darkest nightmares, I screamed and began running as fast as I could. I must have ran for hours until I tripped on a metal object. It turned out to be a hatch that lead to an abandoned world war 2 bunker. Once inside, I checked for anything that I might be able to protect myself with. Thankfully, my phone, my weapons and my blessed chalk are still here. The blessed chalk is towards demon protection, but in a pinch, I thought that if used correctly, it could work on angels as well. When morning comes, I should be able to finish drawing the sigils on my undercoat, hoping to at least hide my presence from them. I will also need to get other items, such as demon weapons and cursed wax, to fully protect myself from the angels. My new goal, as a renegade exorcist, forsaken by the God I served and shunned by the demons I banished, is to find the key to immortality. I have written what has happened to me in the last 24 hours as a warning to all of you. Until I find how to become immortal and save you all, try to do everything in your power to stay alive. Otherwise, you might end up on the silver platter of heaven.",

        "text": " ‚ÄúUno!!!,‚Äù shouted D-Rock.\n\n‚ÄúDamn, again! How do you keep getting the good cards? ‚ÄúI complained. \n\n‚Äú410, I may be homeless, but I‚Äôm still lucky,‚Äù he laughed as he said it. \n\nThat was my nickname. It wasn‚Äôt a very good one, but it stuck. D-Rock gave me that nickname because that‚Äôs the time of day when we first met. Not very creative, but I liked it. I didn‚Äôt want to explain who I was before I hit rock bottom. No one ever really talked about their past in the camp, except for D-Rock. He never stopped talking, but most were focused on the here and now, or at least in conversation. A number for a name; it was fitting. \n\n‚ÄúHey fellas, I won‚Äôt to bring in another person.‚Äù\n\nThe group grumbled, complaining that we had a good thing. We didn‚Äôt need to mess up the dynamic. \n\n‚ÄúD-Rock, you are always making us vulnerable. We got a good thing. If you bring too many people in, the supply gets cut off.‚Äù\n\nCaptain was sort of the boss, the el jefe if you will. He had worked out a deal with a sympathetic teenager over at a family run grocery store. Billy was his name and instead of just throwing out expired food he would bag it and give it to Captain. \n\n‚ÄúShe was raped while hanging out with another group, and they ain‚Äôt gettin rid of the guy. He‚Äôs going to do it again. They gave em a warning like that‚Äôs going to mean shit.‚Äù\n\nEveryone grew quiet. It was a collective concentration on what needed to be done. \n\n‚ÄúI say we let her in,‚Äù Stew mumbled. \n\n‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù adding my two cents. \n\nOne more hand of cards and we were all off to bed. We had some tents and a couple of shanties, one for supplies and our own little clinic. If you were so inclined and needed a fix, we had built a safe shanty, as we called it. It had the only mattress in camp, and we took turns looking in to make sure everything was alright, if someone had decided to occupy it. Most of us though preferred alcohol. I didn‚Äôt really see the hard stuff that much. When I first started roaming the streets looking for somewhere to sleep, I got hooked up with D-Rock early on and the group he was with was more in line with my own problems. It's weird to think that within the homeless community, there are cliques. Humans are the same no matter their situation. They‚Äôd rather be with their own kind. In this case, your own kind was akin to how you got to the streets. You didn‚Äôt have to tell anyone how it happened. It was easy to figure out. There is a myriad of reasons people become homeless. In fact, D-Rock didn‚Äôt become homeless because he was an alcoholic. Well, I guess that‚Äôs sort of not true. He became an alcoholic because he lost his nine-year-old son to cancer, and after that his wife left him. He couldn‚Äôt face reality and who could blame him. He started drinking and from that moment on he started stepping away from civilization and into the gutter. \n\nMy own story is a little different. I was a heroin addict. I had, of course, started like so many people, hooked on pain killers. I have a degree in business. I was promoted to supervisor and working my way up the corporate ladder as they say. My life was fine, I was doing well and then I fell off my ladder while I was cleaning my gutters. They say I fractured my spine in several places. I never really recovered, and the pain never subsided. They assured me it would heal in time. I think my doctor was an idiot. I tried to get a second opinion, but the result was the same. They said I was healing but I felt like I was getting worse.  My doctor prescribed Hydrocodone and I loved that stuff. Oh man, it made me feel so good. I remember my ex-wife hated it. She did not like the feeling at all. If she was prescribed any, she would take only enough for the first day or so and I would always finish off the bottle. \n\nEventually, my wife left me. It got bad. I spent everything we had. I don‚Äôt blame her for leaving. It wasn‚Äôt fair for her to sink with the ship. I was the Captain, and I alone should go under. I hear people every now and then admit that they have a drinking problem, but they‚Äôll say that they can handle it. They call themselves functioning alcoholics. I say bullshit; there‚Äôs no such thing. You‚Äôre an alcoholic and there‚Äôs someone at home, a wife, a husband, or a mom and dad, who makes sure you don‚Äôt miss work, who wipes your ass, and does everything possible to create the illusion that your life is in order, and everything is rainbows and sunshine. Yet, if that someone gives up on you, you‚Äôre living in a shanty town like the rest of us. \n\nThe next day we were going to meet the new tenant. I hadn‚Äôt really been close to a woman in a while and although there was not much I could do to improve my disheveled appearance I was going to try to freshen up a bit. I knew I smelled like a boy‚Äôs locker room after football practice and after someone had taken a dump. I smelled like sweat and shit. I went down to the creek but walked a little further than normal. I was a little embarrassed by the fuss I was making over meeting a woman. I didn‚Äôt want the guys to give me hell about it. I washed my face and hands. I plucked off some twigs from a Juniper tree and rubbed it all over my hands and neck, even lifted up my shirt and rubbed it on my stomach and chest.  When I was done, I stood up and looked down the creek to my right and saw in the distance a cave. I had always heard there was a cave but had never seen it. I walked back to the camp and went up to Captain.\n\n‚ÄúHey, did you know there was a cave not too far from here?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou went that far.‚Äù\n\nMy cover was blown. ‚ÄúI was just curious. Exploring a little bit.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever, and I mean it, ever go near that cave. Bad things happen there.‚Äù\n\nI was a little skeptical, not only because I had never heard of this on the news but also because the Captain tended to exaggerate. \n\n‚ÄúBad things, you mean like murder? I‚Äôve never heard any news about that. The police never investigated?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm lying. Yeah, they investigated it, but it never happens to anybody important, so no one cares. It happens to us.‚Äù\n\nI was still incredulous. ‚ÄúThen why are we living here?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause we have a good deal here. We‚Äôre ok if we just stay away from it. Look, you don‚Äôt have to stay. You can leave.‚Äù\n\nI didn‚Äôt respond. First of all, I didn‚Äôt believe it and second, I couldn‚Äôt leave D-Rock. He had become my best friend. \n\n‚ÄúEveryone, I like you to meet Dee,‚Äù D-Rock announced.\n\nSurprisingly to me Dee was a little heavy set. She had long blonde hair and a nice round face. She had the look of a woman who had been living on the streets for a while. When she smiled you could see her teeth weren‚Äôt perfect and she needed some dental work. Her arms in places were scabbed over, but you could see that she once was a very beautiful woman. That was a common adjective in the homeless community- such and such ‚Äòonce was.‚Äô He once was a successful high school baseball pitcher. She once was pursuing a career in law. I thought it was neat. It was less about seeing the person‚Äôs failure and seeing the missed opportunity, that they had the means to be successful but somehow life had robbed them of it. Of course, people acknowledged their mistakes, but justice isn‚Äôt always dealt evenly. Karma isn‚Äôt perfect, people suffer vastly different consequences for the same mistakes, especially when you‚Äôre on the margins. \n\nYeah, Dee once was beautiful, so I perceived her as beautiful. I was nervous but worked up the nerve to introduce myself. \n\n‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm 410.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú410? Is that a part of your Social Security number?‚Äù She chuckled. \n\n‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs the time D-Rock and I first met. It wasn‚Äôt my choice. You don‚Äôt get to choose your own nickname here.‚Äù\n\nShe smiled, ‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs hope I get a good one.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHey, tonight I think he should let Dee have the safe shanty. She‚Äôs not fixin or anything. I just think she‚Äôs a guest first and should get the finest we have to offer, but as soon as she becomes a member, she has to share in the shitty stuff like the rest of us.‚Äù\n\nEveryone laughed and I could tell that D-Rock had taken a shine to her. I was a bit jealous because I really liked her and it seemed she was more into him than me. \n\nThat night I was hurting, hurting bad. I needed a fix. I hadn‚Äôt been on the corner collecting, and I needed money. How could it get it quick? I was dry heaving and that‚Äôs the worst, because there‚Äôs no relief. Normally, you vomit, expel what you have eaten, and you feel better. I had nothing in my stomach. It was empty but I kept heaving, straining more stomach muscles and irritating my throat. I was sweating like I was in an oven. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I had to get out and walk. \n\nIt was late in the night. There was no moon. The only light was the small streetlamp from the grocery store on the other side of the bank. You could look across from our camp and see the back door where we would get our supplies. I heard a rustle of leaves and saw the flaps of Stew‚Äôs tent fold into the interior of his tent as if something invisible had crawled through. The flaps moved now to the exterior and Stew‚Äôs body was moving across the ground. His feet were together and up off the ground, as if something was dragging him. His arms never moved but were flung up over his head. He was dragged over the top of a rock and his head bounced up and then violently back to the ground. Stew didn‚Äôt react. I couldn‚Äôt see if his eyes were closed or not. It was too dark. \n\n‚ÄúStew. Wake up. Wake up,‚Äù I whispered. As silly as it sounds, I didn‚Äôt want to wake up everyone else, but then the dragging became quicker, and Stew was sliding across the ground like a human luge in an Olympic competition. It was then that I yelled. It was automatic. \n\n‚ÄúStew! Stew! Wake up. Hey, something is happening.‚Äù\n\nCaptain came out of his tent. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù\n\nI was dumbfounded and could only point in Stew‚Äôs direction. I know the Captain may not have seen it all but he caught a glimpse of it because I heard him whisper to himself, ‚ÄúNot again.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot again? What the fuck are you talking about.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe cave.‚Äù \n\nEveryone else had awakened and were asking what all the noise was about. \n\n‚ÄúNothing. Everyone, go back to sleep. Stew and I had an argument and he‚Äôs probably going to leave.‚Äù\n\nThe group bought it and went back to their tents, but I stayed right where I was and waited. \n\n‚ÄúWhy did you lie to them?‚Äù We have to go find and help him.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLeave it alone 410. There‚Äôs no helping him. He‚Äôs gone. The group is better off not knowing and you‚Äôre better off staying here.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you. You‚Äôre just going to pretend like nothing happened. What do you know that you‚Äôre not telling us.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDid you see anything? Huh, dumbass. Did you see anything? I bet you didn‚Äôt. You only saw Stew‚Äôs body. Doesn‚Äôt that tell you something? Doesn‚Äôt that say you‚Äôre dealing with something you can‚Äôt fight?‚Äù\n\nI had been lost in our conversation and when I really started to think about it the whole affair scared the hell out of me. \n\n‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt see anything.‚Äù\n\nI went back to my tent but of course I didn‚Äôt go to sleep. The only good thing is that the fear had beaten back my craving for a bit. I could do without a fix for the next hour or so. I laid there debating on whether or not I should go to that cave and look for Stew. We hadn‚Äôt always gotten along. There were times he would try to muscle me off of the corner of Hayworth Lane and Williams Pike. That was prime real estate for collecting and for some reason most people were more generous at that spot than anywhere else. Maybe it was because there was a church there with a statue of Jesus staring directly at traffic, like a warning that if you didn‚Äôt give, he would see it and record your greediness in his heavenly hall of records. I didn‚Äôt like Stew, but I couldn‚Äôt let him suffer. \n\nI made my way out of the tent and saw Dee standing outside the safe shanty. I looked at her real quick and then started making my way to the cave. \n\n‚ÄúHey, where you going 410?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNowhere. Just stay there,‚Äù I said abruptly and in an angry tone. \n\n‚ÄúWell damn, in that case I‚Äôm coming anyway just out of spite.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLook Dee, it‚Äôs not safe here. Stew didn‚Äôt leave. Someone or something dragged him off. I‚Äôm going to look for him. Captain knows, but he‚Äôs not willing to tell the truth.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm still coming.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHoly shit, you‚Äôre so stubborn.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYep.‚Äù\n\nWhat could I do. I didn‚Äôt want her to make a scene. I didn‚Äôt want anyone else to know where I was going. The trek was easy at first but then the bank got steep and overgrown with a thick underbrush. In the midst of all that brush were large rocks with steep gaps in between. I luckily avoided hurting my leg, stepping into one of the gaps. I fell fast and hard up to my knee. If I would have had time to react, I would have unwisely twisted myself and ended up breaking my leg. Dee grabbed me by the arm and helped me out. The terrain made me think that whatever dragged Stew out this way must have been supernaturally strong. I was glad that we weren‚Äôt too much farther from the cave. \n\nAs we approached the mouth of the cave, I saw Stew‚Äôs clothes laying on the ground. I knew it was his clothes because I recognized his bright Daytona Beach tee shirt. I looked back at Dee and motioned to her to be quiet. With careful steps we slowly made our way to the mouth of the cave to see what was inside. \n\nStew‚Äôs nude body was lying on its back. He had been cut open from the bottom of his chin down through his pelvis. He was an empty shell, his body cavity scooped out of all internal organs. The interior cave walls were bathed in blood. All the sudden something invisible lifted Stew‚Äôs body by the ankles and violently smashed his head against the outside wall of the cave. His head imploded. And then again, he was smashed against the rocks. This happened about three more times. And as if to give up on its prior course of action, the spirit started to twist Stew‚Äôs head off. His head pivoted around in a circle, snapping the bones in his neck and then his head was torn straight up from his body. \n\nDee had already hauled ass out of there. I turned to run myself, but this spirit or demon grabbed me and slung me down the bank and into the creek. I sat up quickly. The creek at that point was only about two feet deep. I saw the tree limbs snapping, brush parting, and the forest floor compressed by something making its way towards me. I could tell that it had come to the edge of the bank. I didn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt understand why but I sensed that it would not come in the water. I heard Dee yell in pain. She had fell through one of the gaps. The spirit made a new path toward Dee. \n\n‚ÄúDee. It‚Äôs coming after you! Hurry. Get in the water. It won‚Äôt get in the creek! Go dammit. Get in the water!‚Äù\n\nI saw Dee struggling to get her leg free. The spirit was getting closer. She finally got free and headed towards the creek. She got about two feet away and launched into a headfirst dive. While she was in the air the spirit swiped at her, hit her feet, and knocking her into a tailspin. Instead of a graceful dive it turned into a belly flop. It wasn‚Äôt a ten in the eyes of a judge, but it got her to safety. \n\nI waded up the creek to where she was standing. We looked at each other in bewilderment. I couldn‚Äôt help to think how sexy she looked with wet hair. \n\n‚ÄúYou look horrible,‚Äù she said. \n\n‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell 410 what do we do now.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI only know for now we‚Äôll travel through creek.‚Äù\n\nWe waded up the creek and when we got almost to the bank under the campsite, I heard Captain yelling.\n\n‚ÄúYou went to that cave didn‚Äôt you. I told you not to do that. I bet you didn‚Äôt like what you saw.‚Äù He walked down to the edge of the bank. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you come up out of the water?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, but I suggest you get in the water as well,‚Äù I said. \n\n‚ÄúDad, what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù I looked up and saw Billy on the other side of the creek holding a shopping bag in his hand. ‚ÄúDo you still need these?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDammit Billy. I told you never to come out here. Just leave the bags out by the dumpster.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDad? Billy is your son?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúOk 410, you snooping son of a bitch. I guess the cat is out of the bag. I like you too. I gave you passage. I gave you protection.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBilly, go back into the store.‚Äù Billy did as he was told, and I could hear the store door clang shut. \n\n‚ÄúCaptain, you‚Äôre not making any sense,‚Äù added Dee. \n\n‚ÄúBitch shut up! I didn‚Äôt want you here anyway!‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúYes, I own the grocery store and I own the land with a cave on it. The land on up from the cave encompasses a farm and my lovely half a million-dollar home. I‚Äôm not homeless, never have been. The man I bought the house and land from had a little secret. You see back in the old days you couldn‚Äôt really keep people from squatting on your land. Dogs could work but they could only patrol so much area without getting bored and go after a squirrel or something. There‚Äôs not enough time to build a fence to surround so much land, so much wealth if you will. Yet, someone learned that you could summon a protective demon. A demon beholden to the owner of the land. It would guard your boundaries and leave you alone. There‚Äôs nothing more efficient. It was a previous owner, not the old man, someone as far back as the colonial times. The old man told me that no one knew how to stop it or get it to leave, so he made sure that he performed the little ritual that gave any visitor he wanted safe passage. Although, he said one time he got curious. Some young man had camped out on his land. He was hunting and a stray bullet hit his house. That angered the old man. You come on my land and hunt without permission, and then to top it off, you hit my house where my wife and kids are sleeping. Oh, he said what that spirit did to the young man was terrifying. I, on the other hand, was amazed by it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôve been bringing homeless people here to feed the beast.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot everyone 410. If you are really down on your luck and its not your own fault then I leave you alone and eventually force you to leave, but if you‚Äôre a worthless piece of shit, I let the beast rid the world of your helplessness, sucking on the teat of everyone else‚Äôs hard work. Stew was an accident. I didn't mean to let it get so close to the camp. That happens sometimes. Haven't figured out how to set new boundaries.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why the spirit can‚Äôt come to the creek. Asshole here don‚Äôt own the creek,‚Äù said Dee. \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, but you can‚Äôt walk in the creek forever.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut we can get to land you don‚Äôt own.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI thought of that Dee.‚Äù Captain pushed his flannel shirt aside and pulled his pistol from his holster. ‚ÄúSorry guys, but this too good of a thing to have a couple of junkies ruin it.‚Äù He aimed and shot, hitting Dee in the arm. Out of nowhere D-Rock tackled Captain from behind, knocking the gun out of his hand. The gun was slung far down the bank but not close enough for me to grab it. \n\nCaptain kicked D-Rock in the face and turned to come after the gun. The spirit grabbed D-Rock and threw him into the air. D-Rock started to scream in fear. I could hear his agony. I knew that something bad was happening, but I was focused on the gun and while the spirit was occupied with D-Rock I figured I could grab the gun and somehow save him. I climbed up the bank and grabbed the gun at the same time that Captain did. I had the stock, but he had a firm grip on the barrel, and it was pointed away from both of us. I punched him in his face with my left, but it wasn‚Äôt very powerful, given that I‚Äôm not a lefty. This infuriated him and he began doing the same to me, but his punches weren‚Äôt weak. They were devastating. He broke my nose and blood was flowing like water out of a faucet. My eyes were watering, and I was about to pass out. At that point, I saw a rock hit the side of his head. Dee had hurled a rock at him, and it was a magnificent throw, pin-point accuracy. He fell back and I secured the gun. \n\nHe wasn‚Äôt out cold, but he was weak. ‚ÄúOk 410, you got me. I‚Äôm done. You can get in on this. I didn‚Äôt tell you the whole story. I can also share ownership of the spirit.‚Äù I gather that was bullshit and he was just making that up. His story wasn‚Äôt convincing, I just didn‚Äôt have the nerve to kill another human being, no matter how evil, and especially one with a child to raise. \n\nD-Rock‚Äôs body was thrown in the creek, splashing Dee and I with water and blood. His body bent in half, back broken and head missing. \n\n‚ÄúOh D-Rock,‚Äù I heard Dee whimpering. \n\nI grabbed Captain by his pants around the ankles with a strength I didn‚Äôt know I had and dragged him to me. I aimed the gun at his face and shot, but I didn‚Äôt stop until I had emptied the gun and as I was shooting, I lowered the gun to cover more of his body. I hit with every shot, exploding his face and peppering his torso. There was no way he was leaving that spot alive. I tossed the gun into the water. \n\nDee was crying and I was about to break down myself. That was my best friend tossed aside like garbage. We stayed in the creek not daring to leave our safe passage. We didn‚Äôt know how much land Captain owned so we walked at least a mile or two up the creek until we saw a small biker bar. There were some people standing out back talking and having a good time.\n\n‚ÄúWhat in the hell are you guys doing in the water?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWho owns this land, or that bar?‚Äù\n\nA man stepped up and motioned to himself. ‚ÄúI own this bar. Why?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a nephew named Billy, do you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo you own the land all the way down to the creek?‚Äù asked Dee. \n\n‚ÄúYes mam.‚Äù\n\nWe climbed out the creek and made our way up to the bar. \n\n‚ÄúYou guys look terrible. Do you want something to eat? It‚Äôs on me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, thank you,‚Äù I responded. \n\nWe walked to an outside picnic table and sat down. We were filthy with mud, caked all over our bodies and we smelled like nasty old creek water, but the food they brought us was delicious and one good thing about living on the margins, you learn not to give a damn about what people think. What do they know. Absolutely nothing. They can‚Äôt judge. They don‚Äôt know why you are where you are and the reasons for it. Hell, there‚Äôs a demon guarding some land right up the road from where they live, ripping folks apart and stashing their bodies in a cave and they don‚Äôt even know it. Ignorance is bliss, until it shoves its claws right up your ass.",

        "text": "‚ÄúHey, what are you supposed to be?‚Äù\n\nThose were the first words she ever said to me, the first words Angel said to me over twenty years ago.\n\nMy father, if you can call him that, was an abusive piece of shit. I sometimes wondered if he‚Äôd changed after mom left, but I guess he‚Äôs always been that way. He just hid it better.\n\nAfter she left, things grew from bad to worse. He just gave up, lost his job, and spent his days getting wasted on the cheapest liquor he could find.\n\nIn the mornings, I was awoken by him cursing and rummaging through the apartment to find whatever booze was left. In the evenings, he‚Äôd drunkenly yell at me to leave him the hell alone.\n\nThe worst, however, were the days when he raised a hand against me. Every single time, I wondered what I‚Äôd done wrong, pleaded with him to tell me why he was so mad at me, but there was never a reason. No, all his words, all his accusations; they were nothing but excuses. He just wanted to vent his anger, to beat me, and beat me he did.\n\nThe day I met Angel, I‚Äôd been hiding in my room, staring at a picture of mom and begging for her to come safe me. Of course he heard, and the moment he saw the picture, he flipped. He ripped it from my hands and tore it apart. Before I could protest, he slapped me across the face.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever say shit like that again, I‚Äôll dare you,‚Äù he slurred at me, holding a bottle of liquor in his hand.\n\nAs so many times before, I ran and fled from the disgusting hellhole our apartment had become. Yet, I didn‚Äôt make it far. My tiny legs gave way, and I broke down crying.\n\nI huddled up, arms around my knees, and sat sobbing in the building‚Äôs hallway. On my cheek, I could still feel his knuckles, and I could taste the blood that ran from my split lip. The few other people who lived in the place ignored me, pretending they didn‚Äôt see me, like they always did. No one cared about a crying little girl. I was all alone.\n\nThat‚Äôs until I heard her voice.\n\n‚ÄúHey, what are you supposed to be? Why are you crying?‚Äù\n\nWhen I looked up, I saw an older girl, a teenager, crouching in front of me. Her round face was framed by wild, strawberry blond hair, and her eyes were of the deepest blue. Her most prominent feature, however, was her smile. It was bright and toothy, more akin to a comical grin than anything else. When I saw it, the tears stopped and I couldn‚Äôt help but giggle.\n\n‚ÄúThere now, that‚Äôs much better,‚Äù she said, laughing, and patted me on the head.\n\n‚ÄúW-who are you?‚Äù I asked in a sheepish, barely audible voice.\n\nFor a second, she looked away, and a contemplative look washed over her face. Then she grinned at me again.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm Angel,‚Äù she brought out in a voice as cheerful as her smile.\n\nOnce more, I giggled.\n\nThat‚Äôs how I met Angel, and that‚Äôs how we became friends.\n\nAngel was an odd one. I‚Äôd met no one just like her. She was always positive, always bouncy and full of energy and she always wore that wide, beaming smile.\n\nYet I never learned much about her or her life. I didn‚Äôt know if she went to school or worked, who her parents were, or where she lived. All she told me was that she lived in the same building, but her place was in such a terrible state of disarray, she was too embarrassed to invite anyone over.\n\nFor all I knew, she lived every day not having a care in the world, just having fun and doing whatever she wanted.\n\nDuring my time with Angel, she taught me about the streets and the area we lived in. While those things might not have been special for an adult, for an eleven-year-old child, they felt like the best-kept secrets in the world.\n\nOne day, she led me to an abandoned backyard where a bunch of strays had made their home. On our way, Angel told me that one of them had recently born young. I was out of it. At first, the kittens were terribly afraid of me, but Angel taught me how to befriend them. Over the next couple of days, the two of us spent hours petting and playing with them.\n\nOn another day, she introduced me to Mrs. Schneider, who owned a small corner store in the area. It was a chaotic place, but Angel told me the old woman loved nothing more than little kids. Occasionally, she‚Äôd even hand out free candy.\n\nThe moment I stepped inside and actually saw the old lady, I almost ran away. I‚Äôd imagined her to look like a fairy godmother, but the woman behind the counter couldn‚Äôt have been more different. Her face comprised nothing but wrinkles and her bony hands held onto the counter like the claws of some animal. The worst, however, was her expression. Her mouth was pressed together into a single, hard line as she stared us down with piercing eyes.\n\n‚ÄúNow, what are you doing here? Didn‚Äôt I tell you to never come back?! I don‚Äôt want no girls like you in my store!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, Auntie Schneider, I know you don‚Äôt mean those things,‚Äù Angel said, laughing and vanished between the store‚Äôs aisles.\n\n‚ÄúNow you little, I‚Äôll dare you-‚Äú she started, but broke up when she saw me.\n\nSuddenly, her expression softened, and her face melted into a warm, caring smile.\n\n‚ÄúMy, oh, my, and who might you be?‚Äù she asked, stepping past the counter and towards me.\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my friend!‚Äù Angel proclaimed from down the aisle.\n\nMrs. Schneider shot her a piercing look before she turned back to me.\n\n‚ÄúNow little girl, you should be careful who you‚Äôre friends with these days,‚Äù she whispered into my ear. ‚ÄúThat one over there, she‚Äôs no good... But, my, look at you, you‚Äôre nothing but skin and bones. Let me give you a little treat!‚Äù\n\nWith that, the old lady vanished behind the counter again and rummaged through the drawers. She was wheezing and mumbling to herself, but when she finally emerged again, she handed me a candy bar.\n\n‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúT-thank you,‚Äù I whispered with downcast eyes, shuffling around awkwardly.\n\n‚ÄúNow aren‚Äôt you well mannered, not like... Hey, hold on, what‚Äôs that in your pocket?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh no, busted!‚Äù Angel said, laughing\n\nBefore the old lady could so much as react, Angel had gotten a hold of my hand, and together the two of us rushed from the store.\n\n‚ÄúThanks again, Auntie Schneider!‚Äù Angel called out over her shoulder.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare call me that! And don‚Äôt you dare come back!‚Äù\n\nAs we ran, Angel was still laughing, and soon I joined in her laughter. We only stopped when we‚Äôd made it a few blocks down the road. There we fell to the ground, utterly exhausted.\n\nAngel was still giggling to herself and showed me a candy bar of her own, one she must‚Äôve snuck from one of the aisles.\n\n‚ÄúAngel!‚Äù I brought out in shock. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù\n\nShe only waved her hand, downplaying what I‚Äôd been taught to be a terrible crime.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, it‚Äôs all right. Auntie Schneider doesn‚Äôt mind. She‚Äôs just pretending to be an angry old lady!‚Äù\n\nOf course, I trusted her, and, of course, the same thing would happen every time we went there. Yet, sometimes, I could‚Äôve sworn I saw a hidden little smile on the old woman‚Äôs face as the two of us raced away. Her curses, however, always stayed the same.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt the only time Angel showed me her special talents. Stealing candy from an old lady‚Äôs store was one thing. Doing the same at a costly art store was entirely different.\n\nSaid store was in a nearby mall. It was a giant, multi-storied monstrosity of a building. I‚Äôd only ever been there a few times, years ago, when mom was still around.\n\nBeing back there, after all those years, felt different, almost like I shouldn‚Äôt be there, didn‚Äôt belong. As Angel led me through the mall‚Äôs enormous halls, I didn‚Äôt my best to hide behind her, trying not to be seen by the people around us. All the while, Angel‚Äôs head darted here and there, scanning the area with her deep blue eyes.\n\n‚ÄúThere it is!‚Äù she suddenly exclaimed in a hushed whisper.\n\nBefore I could read the store‚Äôs sign, we were already inside, sneaking past other customers and down an aisle, unseen by the owner.\n\nMy eyes grew wide. I‚Äôd never seen so many beautiful things in one place.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so pretty,‚Äù I whispered to Angel, who gave me a quick nod and another one of her beaming smiles.\n\nI saw costly glassware, various decorations, memorabilia and beautiful porcelain figurines. Eventually, I came to a halt in front of a tiny porcelain cat. It looked as if frozen in time during stretching, was covered in brown stripes and had glowing green eyes. For a long moment, I stared at it before I reached out to touch it.\n\n‚ÄúYou like it?‚Äù Angle asked in a hushed whisper.\n\nI nodded, but then I grew sad and returned it to its place. I knew it was way too expensive, and I knew dad would never spend his money on anything but booze.\n\nWhen Angel saw my expression, a cheeky grin showed on her face. For a second, her eyes darted up and down the aisle. Then in a swift, but delicate motion, one I‚Äôd have missed if I‚Äôd as much as blink, the figurine vanished inside her pocket. I opened my mouth, but she was quick to press her finger against my lips, motioning for me to zip it. A few moments later, we were out of the store, and after another minute, we‚Äôd left the mall behind.\n\nOnce we‚Äôd made it a safe distance away, Angel handed me the little treasure. I couldn‚Äôt help but stare at it in a mixture of disbelief and wonder. At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should take it, but when I saw the cat‚Äôs cute little face, I felt tears of joy coming to my eyes and hugged Angel dearly.\n\nThe most important thing, however, was that I‚Äôd just learned another little face to Angel, who she was, and what she could do.\n\nNeedless to say, Angel became my role model, my hero. I wanted nothing more than to be just like her: beautiful, smart, and crafty.\n\nBeing the child I was, I wasted no time trying to do exactly that. One day, not long after Angel had stolen the tiny figurine for me, I decided to put what I‚Äôd learned to the test.\n\nI didn‚Äôt set out for the mall, of course. I was much too scared to go there on my own. Instead, I made my way to one of the small convenience stores in the area. With quick steps, I hurried inside, and vanished down an aisle. Just like Angel had done, I looked up and down to make sure I was alone. Then, with a shaking hand, I reached out to one of the many chocolate bars. In a motion, I imagined as swift and delicate as Angel‚Äôs, I pocketed it.\n\nThen I raced back toward the entrance. I‚Äôd barely stepped out of the aisle when a hand closed around my wrist and I found myself face to face with an angry, older man who stared me down with cold, hard eyes.\n\n‚ÄúNow, what do we have here? A little pickpocket?‚Äù\n\nI froze. Oh no, what had I done? Stupid, stupid, you aren‚Äôt Angel, you aren‚Äôt like her, not at all.\n\n‚ÄúN-no, I just,‚Äù I started, but my voice broke and didn‚Äôt want to function anymore.\n\nAll I could do was stand there and squirm under the owner‚Äôs hard grip, trying my best not to burst into tears.\n\n‚ÄúOut with it, you little rascal,‚Äù he commanded, while his eyes dug into me.\n\nWithout saying another word, I dutifully revealed the chocolate bar, and with downcast eyes, handed it to him. When I tried to run, however, he didn‚Äôt let go and instead pulled me in closer.\n\n‚ÄúNot so fast,‚Äù he started. ‚ÄúLet me tell you what they usually do to little thieves like you. The police will come and they‚Äôll throw them into jail for a very, very long time. I‚Äôll let you off today, but if you ever do anything like this again, I‚Äôll call them right away.‚Äù\n\nAs a child, and under the man‚Äôs hard, scrutinizing eyes, I had no doubt he was telling the truth. Within moments, I burst into tears, and when I did, he finally let me go.\n\n‚ÄúIf I‚Äôll ever catch you here again, you‚Äôre in for it!‚Äù he yelled after me as I booked it from the store with tears streaming from my eyes.\n\nI‚Äôd barely made it a single block when I saw Angel nearby. In my embarrassment, I tried to rush past her unseen. Angel, however, had already seen me, and stepped right into my path with outspread arms. I came to a halt. At first, I tried to hide my tears, but then I threw myself into her arms.\n\n‚ÄúNow, now, you little troublemaker, what did you do this time?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo they really sent little kids to jail for trying to take a chocolate bar?‚Äù I burst out while snot ran down my nose.\n\nWhen Angel heard this, she burst out laughing and patted my head before she leaned down to face me.\n\n‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs it. Now listen to me, a good little girl like you shouldn‚Äôt do things like this.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre doing it, Angel!‚Äù I protested.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, but that‚Äôs different. I‚Äôm not a little girl anymore.‚Äù\n\nPouting, I bit my lip and turned away from her. When Angel saw it, she began giggling once more.\n\n‚ÄúHey, how about I show you something super cool?‚Äù\n\nWith that, and without waiting for an answer, she took my hand and dragged me after her.\n\n‚ÄúWait, Angel, where are we going?‚Äù\n\nInstead of answering, she gave me another one of her toothy trademark smiles.\n\nWe raced down the street, then through an alleyway and then up another street before we came to rest in front of an unremarkable building. I stood next to her, panting, with no idea what was going on, but Angel was quick to point at the sign above the door.\n\n‚ÄúW-what‚Äôs that?‚Äù I could finally bring out.\n\n‚ÄúAn internet caf√©!‚Äù Angel announced. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go in!‚Äù\n\nAt the time, internet caf√©s were still a popular thing. The internet wasn‚Äôt as ever-present as it is today, and our old social housing building, like so many others in the area, had no connection.\n\nYet at my age, I‚Äôd no idea what an internet caf√© or even the internet was.\n\nWhen Angel set me down in front of a giant computer monitor, and opened up a website comprising nothing but kitty pictures, my eyes grew wider than they‚Äôd ever been before.\n\n‚ÄúOh my god, I love them! I want all of them!‚Äù I half-screamed in my excitement, making a few other patrons throwing us a disdained look.\n\n‚ÄúNot so loud, dummy,‚Äù Angel castigated me, giggling.\n\nBefore I knew it, we‚Äôd spent half an hour in front of the computer. Angel had just shown me a page full of little flash games, and I was busy helping a little cat catch fish when someone spoke up to us.\n\n‚ÄúNow, who do we have here? You know our hourly rate, right? And it‚Äôs double since you brought someone with you. Let me guess, no money again?‚Äù\n\nWhen I looked up from the game, I saw a man in a sweaty shirt that strained under his heavy pot belly.\n\nHis tiny bead-like eyes were focused on Angel and only Angel. It was almost as if I didn‚Äôt exist, and as he continued to stare at her, a hungry grin came over his face.\n\nFor the shortest moment, as Angel turned to face him, her smile wavered and a disgusting look came over her face. For a long, strained moment, neither of the two said anything before Angel went up to him and whispered something into his ear.\n\nA second later, the man walked away and Angel turned back to me.\n\n‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve got to take care of a little something. The owners got some problem with the computers, and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, I‚Äôm secretly a computer wizard! Just stay here and play your game. I‚Äôll have it fixed in no time!‚Äù\n\nI was about to ask her if I could tag along, but before I could, she gave me another pat on the head.\n\n‚ÄúLook, you just stay here and help the little kitty catch all the fishes, all right?‚Äù\n\nI gave her an enthusiastic nod and went back to my game. Minutes passed, soon half an hour, and eventually, Angel returned to my side.\n\n‚ÄúGood as new,‚Äù she brought out, giving me a thumps-up.\n\nIncidents like this took place a lot when I was with Angel, and many times, she had to leave my side for a bit. Sometimes, she ran into one of her many friends, other times she offered her help to people, just like that day at the internet caf√©.\n\nAs a child, I believed everything Angel told me. Angel was the smartest person I knew. It was only natural that she could repair cars or fix broken computers. I had no doubt that she could do anything. As I grew older, however, I understood what was really happening. Even though Angel was always smiling, always positive, and always full of laughter.\n\nAs happy as my days with Angel were, they weren‚Äôt free of trouble. I always dreaded going home, and I was always afraid when I pushed open the door to our apartment. Often, dad was still awake, heavily drunk and staring me down with a bottle of his disgusting liquor in hand.\n\nSometimes, he‚Äôd yell at me or threaten me, sometimes, he‚Äôd throw an empty bottle my way, but he always stared at me as if I didn‚Äôt belong, as if I was a stray who‚Äôd wandered into the wrong place.\n\n‚ÄúThe hell‚Äôs that?‚Äù he yelled at me one day, early in the afternoon.\n\nHe‚Äôd made his way into my room, and like so many times before, rummaged through what few things were left in it. I knew he was desperate to find something, anything of value, he could trade for booze.\n\nWhat he held in his hand that day, however, was the small porcelain cat Angel had stolen for me.\n\n‚ÄúMy kitty!‚Äù I burst out when I saw it in his hand.\n\n‚ÄúWhere the hell‚Äôd you get that stupid thing from? Don‚Äôt tell me you took some of my money? I knew I should‚Äôve been able to get more than two bottles.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, Angel gave it to me!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAngel? The hell you talking about, you dumb little bitch?‚Äù he snapped at me.\n\nBy now, he‚Äôd grown angry again, seriously angry, and without waiting for an answer, he hurled the small figurine across the room.\n\n‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I screamed, jumped off the bed and hurried to where it had landed.\n\nI‚Äôd hoped it was all right, and that nothing had happened to it, but he‚Äôd thrown it with such force, the tiny figurine had shattered into dozens of pieces. When I saw it, a little paw here, an ear there, and part of the tail further away, I broke into tears.\n\n‚ÄúWhy, daddy? Why‚Äôd you do that?‚Äù I asked, sobbing.\n\nFor a moment, he stared at me, his free hand already balled into a fist, but then he lowered it again. A short little laugh escaped his mouth before he turned to leave the room.\n\n‚ÄúStupid bitch, crying about something like that,‚Äù he mumbled to himself.\n\nAt that moment, I hated him more than I‚Äôd ever hated him before. As I sat there, on the room‚Äôs dirty floor, I tried to piece the little figurine back together. The harder I tried, though, the more it broke apart, into tinier and tinier pieces.\n\nEventually, in a mixture of frustration, anger, and sadness, I jumped to my feet and rushed toward the front door.\n\n‚ÄúI hate you!‚Äù I screamed at dad before I up and vanished.\n\nHis tired eyes focused on me and saw the surprised look on his face for having stood up to him. At that moment, I felt as strong as Angel, unstoppable, but then, as I dashed down the stairs, the tears returned.\n\nAngel‚Äôs kitty. He‚Äôd broken it. He‚Äôd broken it just because I had it! Just because he could!\n\nOutside, I slumped down in a corner near the building‚Äôs entrance. As much as I tried, the tears didn‚Äôt want to stop.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how much time had passed, but eventually, I felt a well-known pat on my head and when I looked up, I saw the same round face framed by strawberry blond hair.\n\n‚ÄúAlways crying, you little dummy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe broke the kitty,‚Äù I lamented between sobs.\n\n‚ÄúNo biggie, I‚Äôll get you another one! I‚Äôll get you all of them, in all colors and all shapes!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut he‚Äôll just break them again, all of them! He‚Äôll break everything, just like mom‚Äôs picture!‚Äù\n\nWith that, I began sobbing once more. For the first time, even Angel‚Äôs bright smile and bouncy demeanor weren‚Äôt enough to make me smile.\n\nFor a moment, Angel was quiet before she let out a heavy sigh.\n\n‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she finally said.\n\nI looked up, giving her a questioning look.\n\n‚ÄúCome on, I‚Äôll show you something. It‚Äôs my special place, so it has to stay our secret, okay?‚Äù\n\nWhen I gave her a weak nod, her smile returned. Then she took my hand and began leading me down the street.\n\nWe walked on for almost half an hour, following alleyways and half-hidden passages before we arrived at an old building.\n\nIt was huge, bigger than any other I‚Äôd seen in the area, bigger even than the mall Angel and I had visited. As I stared upward, I couldn‚Äôt even count how many floors there were. Yet it seemed abandoned. Debris was everywhere, the front door broken down, the windows destroyed, and obscenities covered the walls.\n\nAs I stared at the ominous, looming building, I grew anxious and couldn‚Äôt help but shuffle around.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go! Come on!‚Äù\n\nWhen I didn‚Äôt move, Angel stepped up to me and brought her round, smiling face close to mine.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe, I promise,‚Äù she said, patting my head.\n\nBefore I knew what was happening, we were already inside. As Angel led me down a long, empty hallway, our steps seemed to echo endlessly. Then, she led me to a staircase, and we went up floor after floor.\n\nWhen we‚Äôd made it to the top, I was exhausted and wondered why Angel had brought me here. All I saw was a rusty, old metal door, one that Angel promptly pushed open. The loud scraping noise made me cringe, and my eyes darted around, afraid someone might have heard us.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs no one else here.‚Äù\n\nWith that, she stepped through the door.\n\nAt first, I didn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôd wanted to show me, but then I realized where we were: on a rooftop.\n\n‚ÄúYou can see the entire city from up here!‚Äù Angel exclaimed.\n\nFor a second, I was quiet, too stunned by the view. She was right. You could see everything from up here. The streets, the cars, the buildings, the people, and so much more.\n\nEventually, we sat down by the edge, just staring out at the city, looking at buildings, trying to find our home, or watching the endlessly moving traffic.\n\nAs we did, however, I noticed that Angel‚Äôs face had changed. For the first time, her smile was gone, her deep blue eyes had grown smaller and a thoughtful look had come over her face.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I hate it,‚Äù she suddenly said.\n\nHer voice had become quiet, barely more than a whisper.\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you-?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis,‚Äù she said, and pointed at the city below us.\n\n‚ÄúThis place, this city, this world, all of it! It‚Äôs all just the same. All the fun and all the happiness are gone. Just watch the people! They all just go on, back and forth, day after day after day. No one does anything else, and no one cares for anyone else. They just go to work, go back home and then, they do it all over again, until the day they die. There‚Äôs no color anymore, they‚Äôre all just gray.‚Äù\n\nAs I listened to her, and looked down myself, I noticed it, too. The traffic moved through the street in endless lines of cars that all looked the same. The sidewalks were full of people just shuffling along. As I watched, I realized how right she was. It really was all just the same.\n\n‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs it like that?‚Äù I eventually asked.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how it is. Life, I mean. People lose their innocence, their imagination. They forget their dreams and abandon their wishes. And then, they replace them with work, with money, with responsibilities and with, with... this!‚Äù she exclaimed, pointing at the gray mush that was our city once more.\n\n‚ÄúThey abandon who they are, who they once were, and so they turn gray. By now, all the color in this city‚Äôs gone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut where‚Äôd it all go?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUp there, in the sky. Every dream, every wish and every bit of innocence and imagination, they turn into tears, into irradiant tears. And they‚Äôre all up there, gathering in the sky.‚Äù\n\nI stared at the bluish-gray sky, at the clouds and the sun hidden behind them, but I didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about.\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, Angel put her hands over my eyes.\n\n‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs not how it works. You can‚Äôt see them with your eyes, but you have to use your heart, your imagination. Up there, in the sky, there‚Äôs all the wishes and all the dreams people gave up on. They come in all the colors of the rainbow. It‚Äôs the most colorful and beautiful place in the entire world, one full of joy and happiness. A sky full of irradiant tears, an ocean of the brightest colors.‚Äù\n\nAs Angel continued to describe it and told me about the irradiant tears and of people‚Äôs formless and forgotten dreams, I could slowly see them in my mind. I imagined an ocean of all the colors in the rainbow wafting through the sky. It was hidden from normal eyes, but still there.\n\n‚ÄúCan you see it?‚Äù Angel asked in a whisper.\n\n‚ÄúYes, I can! It‚Äôs so beautiful!‚Äù\n\nAt that moment, Angel took her hands from my eyes and sat down next to me again.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I wish I could escape from the gray, colorless world down there. I wish I‚Äôd be forgotten by everyone, too, by everyone and anyone. Then I could become an irradiant tear myself and be part of that beautiful ocean forever.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I won‚Äôt forget you! I‚Äôll never forget you, Angel!‚Äù I blurted out in an instant.\n\nWhen I said this, Angel smiled at me. Yet this smile was so different from her usual one. It wasn‚Äôt the same beaming one she always wore. No, this one was full of endless sadness.\n\n‚ÄúAngel?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm joking, silly!‚Äù she was quick to say, and her usual beaming smile returned.\n\nA moment later, she put her hands in her pockets, and with a wide grin, brought out a handful of candy, which she divided between the two of us.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how long we sat there. It had been the middle of the afternoon when we‚Äôd made our way up the stairs. As we talked, the sun wandered over the horizon. For a short few minutes, I thought I could actually see them, Angel‚Äôs irradiant tears. When the sun set, the sky was full of colors. At first it was bright yellow and organ, then vibrant red and violet before it was all replaced by the dark of the night.\n\nEven then, we still sat there, staring up at the sky, at the stars, and Angel told me stories about every single one of them. They were all beautiful, colorful worlds, places of happiness, full of joy and dreams and wonder. And once Angel became an irradiant tear herself, she‚Äôd be able to visit all of them.\n\n‚ÄúWe should head home. It‚Äôs gotten way too late,‚Äù she eventually said.\n\nI yawned and gave her a mumbled reply, which prompted another giggle.\n\nShe carefully led me down the many dark flights of stairs, out into the streets and back to our building.\n\n‚ÄúWell, you better head to bed! We don‚Äôt want you to be tired all day tomorrow, do we?‚Äù\n\nAs she said this, I suddenly couldn‚Äôt help it and threw myself at her.\n\n‚ÄúAngel! I... I don‚Äôt want to go back! He‚Äôs always yelling at me and hurting me and destroying everything! Why can‚Äôt I come with you? Why can‚Äôt I sleep at your place?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI told you, dummy, my place‚Äôs a mess and I‚Äôm too embarrassed to show anyone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt mind! Our place‚Äôs dirty too, and it stinks, and there‚Äôs all those bottles and dad, he‚Äôs...‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt go on, started sobbing and buried my face in her bosom.\n\n‚ÄúNow, now, it‚Äôs going to be all right. I bet your dad‚Äôs asleep, anyway.‚Äù\n\nI looked up at her, stared at her round face, at her strawberry blond hair and her deep blue eyes, and eventually, I nodded.\n\nAs quietly as I could, I pushed open the door. Before I stepped inside, however, I turned and looked after Angel once more, whispering her a quiet good night.\n\nThen I tip-toed through the dark, silent apartment, trying my best to find my way between empty bottles and the various items dad must‚Äôve hurled across the room in another drunken stupor. Step by step, I continued, but suddenly I bumped my foot against something unseen. I stumbled backward, tripped over an empty bottle, and fell against the small couch table.\n\nThe resulting thud and quiet yelp that escaped my mouth were bad enough, but then the sound of shattering glass reached my ear.\n\nI froze and held my breath. For a second, this sound drowned out everything else and reverberated through the entire apartment. In shock, I turned around, only to see that one of dad‚Äôs liquor bottles had fallen and shattered on the ground.\n\nSlowly, ever so slowly, my eyes moved upward to the giant, heavy-set figure on the couch. Yet dad didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt get up and continued snoring. Angel had been right. He was asleep. Oh thank god, he really was asleep.\n\nIn the dark, and with shaking hands, I picked up the remains of the bottle. More than once, I winced as shards cut into my hands and fingers.\n\nThe entire ordeal took forever. I was sweating, shaking and constantly staring upward, afraid to find him awake, to find him staring down at me. I could already see his fists in my mind, could almost feel the slap I thought was coming. But no, he didn‚Äôt wake up.\n\nOnce I was finally done, I threw all the shards in the trash before I snuck into my room and hid myself under the blanket.\n\n‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt know, he won‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù I told myself again and again.\n\nI lay in bed for what must‚Äôve been an eternity. I was shaking and terribly afraid he‚Äôd come for me after all.\n\nEventually, out of sheer exhaustion, I drifted off to sleep. In my dreams that night, I was holding hands and the two of us swam through an ocean of colorful, irradiant tears. We were both laughing, traveling all around the world and towards the stars.\n\nAnd then it was over. The irradiant tears and Angel‚Äôs face vanished and were replaced by nothing but the deepest darkness. I felt something pressing against my body, holding me down. I struggled, kicked the blanket away, only to be greeted by a nightmarish, twisted visage.\n\nIn the dark, I almost couldn‚Äôt make out a face. All I could see were wide, glowing eyes. Dad‚Äôs eyes.\n\n‚ÄúThe fuck did you do?‚Äù\n\nHis voice was icy, quiet, but full of pure, unadulterated anger.\n\n‚ÄúDaddy, I-‚Äú I started, but the moment he heard my voice, one of his hands closed around my neck.\n\n‚ÄúYou goddamn little bitch!‚Äù he screamed at me.\n\nHis breath stank of his disgusting liquor, making me cough, almost gag.\n\n‚ÄúThought you could hide what you did, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù\n\nA laugh escaped his mouth. It was a cruel sound unlike anything I‚Äôd heard before, one that send shivers through my entire body.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like your mother, just like her, trying to make a goddamn fool of me!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, daddy. I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to,‚Äù I pleaded with him.\n\nYet, my quiet voice didn‚Äôt seem to reach him and, in one swift motion, he pulled me from the bed and hurled my tiny body across the room.\n\nI landed, crashing against the wardrobe on the other side. When he heard my pained cry, he laughed again.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get for messing with my booze.‚Äù\n\nShambling, he made his way towards me. Each of his steps was slow, and so hard, it seemed to shake the entire building.\n\nBy now, I‚Äôd pushed myself to my arms, then my knees, and began crawling away. I knew I had to get away, I had to get out, but before I could, his hand closed around my ankle.\n\n‚ÄúOh no, you won‚Äôt. Not today, not anymore,‚Äù he slurred at me.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always you. It‚Äôs always been you! The one who ruined everything! If it hadn‚Äôt been for you, Julie wouldn‚Äôt have left me. I‚Äôd still have my job. Without you, everything‚Äôd still be all right!‚Äù\n\nAs he screamed those words at me, he pulled me up by the leg and brought my little body up in front of his face. Even in the dark, I could see the mad grin that distorted it, could see how wild his eyes were.\n\nThe pain as he‚Äôd jerked me upwards had been almost unbearable, but his expression was so much worse.\n\nPanic washed over me in heavy waves and I struggled. I beat the air with my thin arms before I began screaming. I screamed for Angel, screamed with what little strength I had left, screamed at the top of my lungs.\n\nYet within moments, he pushed his giant, sweaty hand over my mouth, drowning out my screams... my hope.\n\n‚ÄúShut the fuck up! There are no angels who‚Äôll come for you.‚Äù\n\nAnd then, he brought his mouth close to my ear and whispered: ‚ÄúNo one will come for you.‚Äù\n\nAs he said this, he began laughing again. It was a manic, wild sound, more animal than human, reminding me of a wild dog me and Angel had once seen.\n\nOnce more, I struggled, fought, tried to scream again and bit down on his hand. I didn‚Äôt even see the slap coming. It was hard, all knuckles. For a moment, my vision went dark. When it returned, I could taste blood in my mouth.\n\n‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs not all. That‚Äôs nothing. I‚Äôll make sure to shut you up for good!‚Äù\n\nWith that, he stumbled towards the small kitchenette at the other end of the apartment and threw me to the ground. Before I could even move, he brought his foot down on me. For a terrified moment, I thought he‚Äôd crush me, trample me until there was nothing left of me.\n\nBut then, in the waning light of the moon, I saw something in his hand, something long and shimmering.\n\n‚ÄúShould‚Äôve done this years ago. Should‚Äôve done it the moment Julie pushed you out of her body! But now, now I‚Äôm taking it all back! My life, Julie, everything! Without you here, it‚Äôs finally going to be all right!‚Äù\n\nAnd in that moment, I screamed once more. With tears of desperation in my eyes, I called out to her, called out to Angel to save me, to rescue me.\n\nDad only laughed. By now, his laughter was shrill, nothing but insane. For a single, mad second, he even joined in my screams, mimicking my voice and calling out for angels as well.\n\nThen the front door burst open.\n\nIt had to be a dream, an illusion, nothing but a figment of my imagination. A moment later, however, a figure threw herself at dad, freeing me and sending both of them stumbling away.\n\n‚ÄúWho the fuck?‚Äù he cursed.\n\nFor the shortest of moments, before the moon vanished behind the clouds again, I saw a round face, strawberry blond hair and deep blue eyes.\n\n‚ÄúAngel? How are you-?‚Äù\n\nOur eyes met.\n\n‚ÄúRun, get out and-!‚Äù\n\nHer voice was cut off when dad plunged the kitchen knife deep into her body. Suddenly, all the sound was gone. I didn‚Äôt hear Angel‚Äôs pained scream, nor dad‚Äôs triumphant laughter. Instead, all I could do was to stare at the single dark spot on Angel‚Äôs body that grew bigger and bigger.\n\n‚ÄúNo! Angel!‚Äù I finally screamed.\n\n‚ÄúOnce I‚Äôm done with this bitch, I‚Äôll make sure to-‚Äú\n\nDad never finished his sentence. When Angel had thrown herself at him, when the two had tumbled away from me, they‚Äôd come to a stop right next to a window. With a last bout of energy, Angel pushed him backward. Glass shattered, wood broke, and a moment later, nothing but an empty broken window remained. Dad was gone, but so was Angel.\n\nFor long moments, I stood there, staring at the ruined window, waiting, hoping for Angel to fly upward, for her to be an actual angel. I hoped for her to be what I always thought she was, my guardian angel.\n\nYet the real world is no fairy tale. No, it‚Äôs a gray, colorless and most of all dark place.\n\nI stood there when police sirens reached my ears, when people started screaming and I still stood there when the police stormed into the apartment. When they tried to lead me outside, I screamed at them, fought and told them Angel would be back, that she‚Äôd rise and come for me.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt happen, of course, and as they dragged me outside, I heard it.\n\nNot ‚Äòhe fell,‚Äô but ‚Äòthey fell.‚Äô Two bodies. Two dead.\n\nI don‚Äôt remember for how long I was at the hospital. Everything after that night was a blur, and none of it mattered. Angel was gone.\n\nOver the next years, I went from foster home to foster home. Things weren‚Äôt easy, and I wasn‚Äôt a good child, and turned into an even worse teenager.\n\nOne day, however, by sheer accident, I ended up at the same dilapidated building. Almost in a trance, I went up the stairs. As I did, I could almost feel Angel‚Äôs delicate hand holding onto mine.\n\nWhen I made it to the rooftop, I remembered it all: the lost dreams and wishes, but also, the irradiant tears. As I stared at the sky, I wondered when I‚Äôd lost my dreams, when I‚Äôd given up on them and if I‚Äôd ever get them back.\n\nNo, I told myself, as I stared down at the city below, I wouldn‚Äôt end up like all those gray, colorless people.\n\nEven long after her death, Angel still helped me, still protected me and kept me going.\n\nThings didn‚Äôt change overnight, of course, they never do, but change they did.\n\nBy now, over two decades after Angel‚Äôs death, my life isn‚Äôt exactly happy, nor is it the most beautiful or colorful, but I‚Äôve found my very own dream. I did what Angel did for me. I help those poor little girls out there, those poor little souls just like me.\n\nOver the years, I learned more about Angel and who she really was. Susann, that‚Äôs what her real name was, and just like me she was a damaged and abused girl. She was no older than sixteen, without a home or family, and did what she had to get by.\n\nThat night, like so many others, when she didn‚Äôt have one of her ‚Äòfriends‚Äô to take her in, Angel had been sleeping in a hidden corner of the building‚Äôs hallway. That‚Äôs how she‚Äôd heard me and that‚Äôs how she‚Äôd been able to rescue me.\n\nShe was nothing but a child herself, one haunted by her very own demons. She never showed them in front of me and pushed them away to become what I needed the most: a guardian angel.\n\nThere‚Äôs one thing, however, one thing, I‚Äôll never be able to do.\n\nAngel‚Äôs dream had been to be forgotten by everyone and anyone, and to become part of the beautiful, colorful ocean in the sky she loved so much.\n\nYet she never will be, not as long as I live. For Angel‚Äôs someone I can never forget.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry, Angel. I‚Äôll guess you have to wait a bit longer before you can become what you truly were, [an irradiant tear.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

I had escaped from Hell. I looked around the cemetery, frowning. Scanning the mind of the child I possessed, I gained his name- ‚ÄúKurt‚Äù- and his address, among other critical information. I found myself in Maine, in the absolute middle of nowhere. But it would have to do.\n\nThe friend stared at me with wide eyes, clear anxiety marring his expression.\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look good at all, man,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou look pale as shit all of a sudden.‚Äù My body wavered and I tripped, nearly falling before the friend grabbed my arm and steadied me. Scanning the mind of the kid, I found the name of his friend.\n\n‚ÄúThanks, Andre,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMaybe it was just something I ate. A little touch of food poisoning or something. I guess I really don‚Äôt feel that good. I‚Äôm just going to head home.‚Äù Andre nodded seriously at me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick up the ouija board and candles and everything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúToo bad we didn‚Äôt get to see anything supernatural happen, huh?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah, too bad‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, walking away. If only he knew.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, as I started walking down the side of the road under the streetlights, I saw the silhouette of an angel, like the ones I had seen torturing people in Hell. Its wings spread out massively behind it twenty feet in each direction, softly swaying to and fro like a flag in a slight breeze. But when I turned my eyes to look directly at it, there was nothing there besides an ancient oak tree with countless branches reaching up to the moon-lit sky.\n\n‚ÄúMy eyes are playing tricks on me,‚Äù I said to myself. Then I remembered the horrifying thousand-voices of the angel as it turned its empty space of a face towards me, how it had said to me, ‚ÄúYou will always return to us in the end.‚Äù I shuddered. It felt like it had been staring directly into my soul, judging me- and finding me wanting.\n\nI had never done psychedelic drugs in my life, but I felt like I was on what I imagined LSD or peyote to feel like. I kept seeing figures out of the corner of my eyes, shadows running across the street, faces in the trees and eyes staring out from the surrounding forest, but whenever I turned my attention to them, they disappeared. It was like something was mocking me, always staying directly out of the view of the center of my vision but playing games on the periphery instead.\n\nThe ground began to tremble, as if an earthquake were starting. I heard running from behind me, and turned to see Andre standing there, sweating and out of breath.\n\n‚ÄúGod, did you just feel that?‚Äù he said, his eyes widening with fear. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre having an earthquake. We don‚Äôt have earthquakes in fucking Maine! What the hell is going on right now?‚Äù He was right. When Maine had earthquakes, they were generally so small no one felt them. But right now it was just getting more and more intense.\n\nTrees began to fall in the forest, the smashing branches creating an echoing cacophony that blotted out of all Andre‚Äôs words afterwards. I saw his lips moving, but I couldn‚Äôt hear anything besides the crashing of the earth, the collapsing of crypts in the nearby cemetery and trees continuously breaking apart.\n\nAll of a sudden, I felt a whooshing sensation and heard deafening crashing inches away to my left. A massive pine tree branch crashed into the ground, its smaller branches slicing up my shirt and back as it fell. At that moment, Kurt and I began to run to the only open area that was close- the cemetery. It seemed the only place where we wouldn‚Äôt get crushed to death by falling trees and branches. We didn‚Äôt even have to speak to each other, but both sprinted in a blind panic, breathing hard, my heart beating out of my chest.\n\nThe shaking behind us was getting so bad that the road was starting to crack. We sprinted as fast as we could, nearly tripping a few times as the pavement heaved and split around us and more branches fell in the distance. The forest around us sounded like it was coming apart. I heard alarms going off in the distance, first car alarms and then the wailing of a tornado siren from the center of downtown. People were definitely waking up, noticing something was very wrong, and I had a feeling it was all my fault.\n\nAs we ran into the cemetery, I first began to see for certain that this was not a normal earthquake. Hands were reaching out of the ground, some skeletal, others with some flesh still hanging on to their cracking bones. I could see the muscles and tendons of those closest as they moved with frantic energy and unbelievable speed, shoveling dirt away and ripping a hole open as they emerged from underneath. Crypts flew open as bodies bashed through the doors with superhuman strength, sending shards of stone flying in all directions.\n\nFrom the eyes of every corpse, I could see pure blackness, just like the blackness of the faces of the angels who controlled Hell. The blackness was piercing, shimmering, beyond any simple absence of light- it was as if a hole was actually ripping in reality right where the eyes of the corpses used to be. And all of the hundreds of them stared directly at me, ignoring Andre completely.\n\nThen, in an instant, the shaking stopped. The silence was deafening and eerie in the aftermath of such a cataclysm. All I could hear was the ringing in my ears and the pounding of my heart.\n\n‚ÄúYou will return to us!‚Äù the corpse in front of me shrieked, his voice sounding like thousands of deep, distorted voices overlapping. He was a half-decomposed elderly man in an expensive Armani suit, strands of white hair still hanging to the papery skin of his skull, his teeth and the muscles of his jaw showing through the decayed holes in his cheeks as he spoke. ‚ÄúDo you need more rope to hang yourself with, sinner? Will you not accept your fate? You dare take the body of an *innocent child* just to fulfill your own selfish desires and try to escape the fate that you deserve?‚Äù\n\nAnother corpse began to move in from my right, a young woman who looked much fresher, but had a massive bullet hole through her forehead. Otherwise, she almost could have still been alive. Yet she spoke with the same voice of the other corpse- the cacophony of many beings blending their vocalizations together almost, but not completely, in sync. Her screaming was so loud I felt my chest vibrating, my heart thudding painfully in my chest as the corpses closed in around me.\n\n‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you done enough, Jay? You are rotted from the inside. Only Hell will purify your evil. Return to us. Give up the body of the child, now!‚Äù I felt around Kurt‚Äôs pockets, having only one idea to get out of this situation. I knew I couldn‚Äôt return with them. And in his right pocket, I found what I knew would be there. A pocket knife.\n\nGrabbing Andre quickly, I flicked open the knife and put it to his throat.\n\n‚ÄúStand the FUCK back!‚Äù I screamed as loud as I could, my throat hurting from the sheer force of my yelling. The circle of corpses stopped moving in on me, but my heart was still beating too fast, my hands trembling so badly I thought I might drop the knife on the ground. I wanted to throw up, but I managed to avoid it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious right now! I will fucking KILL this kid right in front of you all if you don‚Äôt let me go!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHave you gone so far down, Jay?‚Äù the elderly man said to me in the voice of an angel. ‚ÄúYou know you must return to us eventually. Why accumulate more evil to repay? Your kind never learns. But you‚Äôre not a stupid man. You must know we cannot allow you to stay here in the body of this innocent boy.‚Äù He shook his head, almost like a disappointed parent. My hand shook so bad that I sliced Andre‚Äôs skin slightly. Andre yelped, and a few drops of blood ran down his neck.\n\n‚ÄúKurt, what the fuck man?‚Äù he whispered to me. ‚ÄúLet me go. This is crazy. You don‚Äôt have to do this. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Kurt!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI possessed him during your little ritual with the ouija board, but I‚Äôm not him. And I am *not* going back to Hell. No way. Andre, you have no idea what these *things* do to people there. They pour lead down their throats, they hang them from every pole on the street, they burn them and cut them and torment them, then when their victims are too used up, they‚Äôre buried in a field, where they‚Äôre healed and come out of some massive eggplant just to do it all over again. How can anyone expect me to go back there? That‚Äôs totally insane! I would rather die!‚Äù\n\nAt that moment, a fleet of police cars and ambulances started to drive by, their lights flashing but their sirens off since there was no traffic out here, but they slammed on their brakes once they saw the massive crowd of people standing in the cemetery. The cop in the front car got out, looking confused. Then he saw that the people standing around us were not really people at all, with their decomposing bodies, black eyes and skeletal figures, and his jaw fell open.\n\n‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù he whispered. More cops got out behind him, all of them looking confused. Some pulled out their guns and started screaming orders at the walking bodies, while others got back in their cars and locked the doors, staring out in horror, unsure of what to do. Some of them called for backup on their radios. One cop got in his car and drove away like a madman, swerving between the ambulances and other police cars in front of him, his sirens now blaring. He looked like he was screaming inside the car and I think he flipped us off as he sped away. I suppressed a sudden urge to start laughing hysterically at this absurd scene. If I started laughing now, I might never stop. I felt like I was losing my mind under all the stress.\n\nI don‚Äôt know who started it, but one of the cops fired his gun as a few of the corpses started walking towards them, and all hell started breaking loose. The circle of corpses rushed at the police, and then all of the police started firing at once. The gunshots made my ears ring, and I heard a few bullets smash into the crypts and tombstones immediately to my left, whizzing right next to my head and chest. I let Andre go and ran for my life. I don‚Äôt know if he made it out of there or not. He might be dead for all I know.\n\nI scanned Kurt‚Äôs mind and found his house. He was only fourteen and so, of course, lived with his parents. But I needed a place to rest and think, and that was the only one nearby. I ran to the house, running up the stairs without speaking to anyone and locking the door behind me. Shaking, shivering, sick with fear and worry, I laid down on the bed and started to cry for myself and everything I had lost. I thought about my wife and my kid, my old life and how much I missed all of them, and I started sobbing uncontrollably, the tears staining the pillow as I screamed into it in desperation and anger.\n\nAs I write this up, I look out the windows and keep seeing the silhouettes of angels out of the corner of my eye. And now the ground feels like it is starting to shake. I think they‚Äôre coming for me. I wonder if I should keep running, or if I should just go with them to that sick place with the red clouds and the people constantly brought back to life just to be tortured all over again. I am thinking about taking Kurt‚Äôs parents hostage if I need to. The angels don‚Äôt seem to want to see innocents die, and that may be my only chance. I still have the pocketknife just in case, and there are plenty of bigger knives downstairs, if I decide it necessary.\n\nYet the voice of the angel from the cemetery keeps repeating in my head:\n\n*‚ÄúDo you need more rope to hang yourself with, sinner?‚Äù*",

        "text": "Did you know in some states landlords aren‚Äôt required to disclose murders in their units to prospective tenants? I didn‚Äôt.\n\n**Part 1**\n\nThe summer after I graduated from college I landed my first real job. I‚Äôd just spent four years studying engineering, and I was elated to land a high-paying position with a Fortune 500 company so I could finally move out of my parents‚Äô house and strike it out on my own. Now that‚Äôs not to say that my parents were terrible to me and I was running from them, quite the opposite in fact. They‚Äôd merely raised me to be fiercely independent, and now that they‚Äôd helped me get through school, it was time to start paying my own way.\n\nMy new job required me to move out of state, which really wasn‚Äôt a big concern. I‚Äôd gone to school nearly equidistant from my parents‚Äô home as I would be in my new city, and I knew I could always make it back for a weekend if I was starting to feel homesick or lonely. However, where I was moving I didn‚Äôt know anybody, so it would be the first time that I would be living truly on my own. In college I was in a fraternity so I'd always had at least three or four roommates, and while they‚Äôre some of the best guys I‚Äôve ever known, they were quite shit at things like dishes, vacuuming, and not vomiting behind the couch. Needless to say at this point in my life, I was actually very excited to have a place all to myself.\n\nIf you know anything about the midwest, you‚Äôll know that some cities merely exist because a large company settled there a hundred or so years ago. This was true of where I was moving. Details on the company are superfluous to the story, suffice to say that nearly everyone in this area works for the same one and they import people from all over the world to work for them. Most folks move to this area in May right after they graduate from college, but the role I was hired for did not open until August. Therefore, by the time I moved to the area housing options had become a bit limited. Places I viewed were either wildly expensive or so dumpy that the roaches in them were looking for alternate accommodations.\n\nLiving out of a hotel and searching in vain for days, on a Saturday morning I finally stumbled upon a listing for an apartment that looked almost new from the photos online, was within my price range, and was near my new office. I was a bit surprised as I‚Äôd actually called the office for this complex just a couple weeks prior and they‚Äôd told me most of their tenants were on one-year leases and they likely wouldn‚Äôt have any availability until December. Thinking I‚Äôd just gotten incredibly lucky, I called the office again and I was forwarded along to the Property Manager.\n\n‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶Hi, yes I‚Äôm calling to inquire about the available unit I see posted on your website. I called a week or so ago and I was told you wouldn‚Äôt have any units available until around December, so I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs really available or some sort of glitch.‚Äù\n\nA woman‚Äôs voice replied to me. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶Hi‚Ä¶yes‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt realize they‚Äôd have it up on the website already. Umm‚Ä¶yes I suppose the unit is available‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôd made a lot of these calls recently so I was used to how they‚Äôd normally go at this point‚Ä¶typically a rundown of the complex, the amenities of the unit, and the rent details would follow but this felt different. She gave me none of this information and instead sounded hesitant to say they even had a unit available. Maybe customer service just wasn‚Äôt her forte.\n\n‚ÄúGreat! I‚Äôm in a bit of a crunch here, I start my new job Monday and haven‚Äôt been able to locate housing yet, would it be possible for me to come and view the unit today?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶yes, I guess that would be possible‚Ä¶before we proceed though, are you employed by (the company everyone works for)? We can waive the application in that case, we just need to see proof of employment.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes! That‚Äôs the company I‚Äôm starting with Monday. That‚Äôs fantastic that you can waive the application! I‚Äôll bring proof of employment with me to the tour.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay. In that case, I can meet you at the apartment office in an hour and my name is Clara.‚Äù\n\nAnd with that she hung up. Once she‚Äôd heard who I was working for her hesitation had abated. I figured she‚Äôd just been concerned that I wouldn‚Äôt be a fit candidate for the unit and I might be wasting her time.\n\nI arrived at the apartment office almost exactly one hour after our conversation and found Clara waiting for me. She greeted me warmly enough, if not a bit abruptly‚Ä¶she was probably a bit annoyed with having to give a tour on a Saturday and wanted to get it over with. Fine by me I thought. I‚Äôd already looked into this complex before I‚Äôd heard they had no availability, and if this particular unit matched up with the photos online, I was pretty confident it‚Äôd be essentially perfect for me. Clara asked if I was ready to get started and it was then I noticed the bags under her eyes. I surmised she was likely exhausted from dealing with the bullshit that comes with managing a large apartment complex‚Ä¶getting thirty calls a day that a lightbulb was out or a toilet wouldn‚Äôt flush.\n\nWe hopped in a golf cart and headed to Building 17. I found out the available unit was on the third floor, number 1737. Well I guess you‚Äôd call it the third floor, I would have called it the fourth floor, but this complex designated the lowest level as the ‚Äúground‚Äù floor, so the same apartment on that floor would have been designated as 1707. Either way, 1737 was on the top floor of the building and for me this was perfect. I‚Äôd never liked the idea of someone being able to look right into my windows as they walked by and from what I could see on the ride over to Building 17, many of the tenants liked to walk around for exercise.\n\nAs we approached the building, I noticed things got‚Ä¶quieter. The rest of the complex was bustling with life. Adults talking, children playing, dogs barking, but the closer we got to 17, the ambient noise seemed to fade to a dull hum. ‚ÄòStrange,‚Äô I thought, but maybe the tenants in this particular building were just not as social. Truthfully I‚Äôm fairly introverted, so I didn‚Äôt mind that it looked like I‚Äôd be living on the quiet side of town‚Ä¶I‚Äôd had enough socializing for a lifetime in college.\n\nClara parked the golf cart but didn‚Äôt get out. There was a heaviness to her presence and I couldn‚Äôt help asking, ‚Äúis something wrong?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶the last tenants of 1737‚Ä¶it was so‚Ä¶they just left so suddenly.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶did they give a reason why? You‚Äôre not about to show me a place full of black mold or something, are you?‚Äù I chuckled.\n\n‚ÄúNo, no, nothing like that. The place has been cleaned and inspected top to bottom in the last week and no one could find a single issue with it. The tenants didn‚Äôt give a reason for leaving to be honest. In fact, they didn‚Äôt even call us until they were back in their home country.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúReally? That‚Äôs crazy! So they just packed up and left?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, see that‚Äôs just the thing‚Ä¶they didn‚Äôt even pack most of their stuff‚Ä¶it looked like they just grabbed some essentials and small valuables maybe‚Ä¶hard to tell really‚Ä¶place was kinda ransacked. They‚Äôd signed a one-year least just two months prior and seemed ecstatic about their new lives here in America. Young couple‚Ä¶they were talking about starting a family and then they just left. We didn‚Äôt even realize they were gone until the wife called us and told us she didn‚Äôt care what we did with their things‚Ä¶just asked us to send us whatever paperwork and billing she‚Äôd need to sign and pay-off to break the lease and to please never contact her again. That was two weeks ago.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWow! When I saw a place opened up here I figured someone broke their lease early, but I guessed they‚Äôd just gotten another job somewhere or something. Never imagined something so‚Ä¶dramatic.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYea, to be honest it‚Äôs been a rough couple of weeks getting all their stuff cleared out and getting the place ready for a new tenant. For some reason I can‚Äôt seem to get a crew to work in there for more than a day so I‚Äôve had to use several. Hard to find good help and all I guess. Anyway, sorry again, like I said it‚Äôs been stressful around here recently and I was just surprised to have someone call me about seeing the place so soon. We can go take a look now if you‚Äôd like?‚Äù\n\nThis was definitely more than I was expecting and set off a few alarm bells considering they‚Äôd left in such an abnormal fashion, but I was desperate to find housing by this point. Also, I recollected I once had a boss that just up and moved to Colorado one day and never told anyone about it or even quit his job‚Ä¶just stopped showing up to work and we never saw him again. We only found out where he went via social media. Sometimes people just do weird shit, I reasoned. Maybe one of the previous tenants did get a new job back home and they were going to be making so much money that they just planned to buy all new stuff. That had to be it‚Ä¶just some rich dickheads left their mess behind for someone else to clean up and all it meant was I was going to get a great new place just before I started my new job.\n\nI told Clara I was ready to go check the place out and we ascended the stairs to 1737. As she put the key in the lock, I noticed the slightest reluctance‚Ä¶just a fraction of a second before she turned the key and opened the door. ‚ÄòShe really doesn‚Äôt want to be here‚Ä¶‚Äô I thought. However, any misgivings I had were quickly washed away as I entered and found it was everything I could have hoped for. Just as the photos online had intimated, it was nearly new inside. In fact, had Clara not told me there‚Äôd been at least five previous tenants, I would have never known it wasn‚Äôt a new build. She told me they had freshly painted and installed new carpets (standard procedure when a tenant moves out) and I‚Äôd have almost 1000 square feet all to myself. I couldn‚Äôt believe anyone would want to abandon this place, as by all accounts it appeared to be in perfect condition, and even had a balcony I could use to spy on the neighbors. The only thing I noticed that seemed a bit off was the faint smell of ozone, like there was an electrical issue of some kind. Clara assured me that, while she could smell it too, she‚Äôd had an electrician thoroughly check the unit and he‚Äôd reported everything was up to code and there was nothing to worry about.\n\nWith that, I‚Äôd seen and heard enough. I was ready to sign away the next year of my life and start moving in. It was odd, but while I could tell Clara seemed uncomfortable just being in the unit‚Ä¶shifting her weight constantly‚Ä¶her eyes darting to the corners of the room‚Ä¶I felt inherently at home. I‚Äôd only ever experienced that feeling at my parents‚Äô house before, just the sense of belonging‚Ä¶like the apartment itself wanted me there. I told Clara as much, and she gave me a weak nod of approval before she asked if we could return to the office to finalize the paperwork. As we were leaving, she told me she‚Äôd send someone out to fix the ‚Äúoverzealous‚Äù AC as soon as possible and apologized for it being freezing in there, but I normally run hot and told her I had felt perfectly natural while inside.\n\nAs promised, this complex worked with new hires to my company all the time and all I needed to do was show Clara my offer letter with the salary I‚Äôd be making, sign the one-year lease, and cough up the security deposit and first month‚Äôs rent before she handed me the keys to 1737. Apparently they trusted that the company was doing a thorough background check on new employees so they didn‚Äôt really need to one themselves for new tenants.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt believe it. Just that morning I had been having a mild anxiety attack wondering if I was going to be stuck living in a hotel for months, and now I had a place to call home. Expediently, I shot back to the hotel, grabbed what little I had there, checked out, and pointed my truck in the direction of my storage unit.\n\nI was intent on moving in as quickly as possible, which given how few belongings I‚Äôd brought from my parents‚Äô was not going to be difficult. In fact, I was nearly able to pack it all into one truckload and would only have to return for the mattress and box spring. Given this, on my first run to 1737, I mulled over all the furniture I‚Äôd need to buy before I invited over any guests. Currently I‚Äôd only be able to offer a seat on my lap in the recliner or a spot on my bed, which would be awkward at best for any new friends and a touch ‚Äúforward‚Äù for any dates I might bring home. I smirked thinking through several of these scenarios as I parked my truck in front of Building 17.\n\nWhile I‚Äôd initially been excited by the prospect of living on the third floor, now that I was staring down the barrel of hauling my net worth up three flights of stairs alone, I had my first moment of trepidation. And without warning, that trepidation started to spiral into a full-blown panic attack. Unfortunately, I suffer from a severe anxiety and panic disorder, but I‚Äôd been uncharacteristically calm with everything up until this very moment. But, now that I had just a second to stop and think, my mind spiraled into a frenzy. ‚ÄòI‚Äôd only been in the unit for ten minutes tops, I signed the paperwork with nary a question‚Ä¶did I even check under the bed in the hotel room and make sure I hadn‚Äôt lost a sock? What the hell did I just do?!‚Äô Something about the apartment must have seduced my synapses because I couldn‚Äôt fathom how I‚Äôd gotten this far without a second thought.\n\nDesperately, I jumped out of the truck and tried to locate where I‚Äôd tossed my bag from the hotel. My panic attack meds were buried somewhere in there and I had a feeling this one was going to require a double-dose. My psychiatrist had advised me only to take them as needed and really only to take one, but I found that that sometimes still left me a bit on edge and I took a second one anyway. As I shakily choked down the pills, my phone started to ring and I saw an incoming call from Mom.\n\n‚ÄúHey Mom.‚Äù\n\nI tried to sound confident, but mothers always know when something‚Äôs wrong.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? How‚Äôs the apartment hunt going? Are you still having trouble finding a place?‚Äù\n\nOh my god, I hadn‚Äôt even called my parents! I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Yea I was independent and I wanted to start behaving like a real adult but for a decision this big, I‚Äôd normally at least have called my mom first. ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs gotten into me?‚Äô I wondered.\n\n‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know what came over me today. I found a place and took a tour and just signed the paperwork without really thinking about it. I was literally about to start moving stuff in when I started having a panic attack. It‚Äôs not like me at all, I normally have to have every question answered‚Ä¶but something about the place‚Ä¶I just got a feeling, it felt like being home with you and Dad.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay honey‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to need you to try and take a few deep breaths for me‚Ä¶let‚Äôs talk through this. Did you take your medication?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, I just took it‚Ä¶I‚Äôll sit back in the front seat while I wait for it to kick in and we can talk.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay, so let me just ask a few questions. Is it a place in one of the complexes you showed me before?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs in that nice one that said they wouldn‚Äôt have availability until December. They had a unit unexpectedly open up, so I called and took a tour and holy shit, I live here now I guess‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay, I get why you‚Äôre panicking right now, but that actually sounds like a good thing! You‚Äôd already looked into that place before‚Ä¶it‚Äôs probably why you didn‚Äôt feel the need to ask a ton of questions. And I know you‚Äôve been stressed trying to find a place, so if it felt like home, I can understand why you just jumped on the opportunity. If you‚Äôre really stressed about it though, email me a copy of the lease and I‚Äôll read through it to make sure it‚Äôs all on the up-and-up, alright?‚Äù\n\nMy mom worked for the city back home in their public housing sector and was extremely well versed in lease agreements. I‚Äôm not sure if it was her offer or the meds starting to kick in, but I felt my heart rate start to decrease and I began processing information rationally again. So what if it had been a bit of an impulse decision? She was right. I‚Äôd looked into the complex previously, many people from my company lived there, I could afford it, and it was far nicer than the hotel I‚Äôd been staying at even if I was only going to have bachelor pad levels of amenities for a few days.\n\n‚ÄúThanks Mom, yea that helps. They did email me my signed copy of the lease, I‚Äôll send it over to you this evening when I get settled in a bit. I need to start hauling stuff up the stairs now. I have one more run to the storage unit to make and then I‚Äôll grab some takeout for dinner‚Ä¶probably stop in a store and grab some sodas and chips to snack on as well.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMaybe get some healthy snacks too? Carrots?‚Äù She replied.\n\n‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù I snickered, ‚ÄúI have to run or I‚Äôm going to run out of daylight here. Thanks again, love you!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLove you too, oh and take some pictures of the new place and send them to me and your Dad!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWill do!‚Äù\n\nShe hung up and after a few more deep breaths, I willed myself out of the truck, grabbed the first box, and headed towards the stairs. I was aware there wasn‚Äôt an elevator from the tour earlier that day, but I hadn‚Äôt truly anticipated just how much that was going to suck until I carried up that first box (which happened to be full of dishes). In my youthful and testosterone-addled mind, I remember thinking something along the lines of, ‚Äòstairs will be good for me, I‚Äôll get some extra exercise, maybe I‚Äôll even drop a few pounds!‚Äô This, I found, was a very stupid thought. Stairs are stupid, and I was even more stupid for being excited about stairs.\n\nI guess you could say that I was pretty out of shape at the time as I‚Äôd definitely spent a lot more time in the lab and at the bars than in the gym while I was in college. Also, I still hadn‚Äôt quite kicked my smoking habit so I was huffing pretty aggressively by the time I approached the door for 1737.\n\nI stuck my key in the door and as soon as it bottomed out in the lock, I had the strangest sensation wash over me. Almost like I‚Äôd made an electrical connection at my fingertips and it flowed through every atom in my body. The instinctual feeling that this was home returned‚Ä¶and I didn‚Äôt just feel it‚Ä¶now I heard it. The softest voice.\n\n‚Äú*You are safe here*.‚Äù\n\nIt happened so quickly, and so quietly, I barely caught the words. I swung my head around to see if someone had snuck up on me and finding no one, realized I‚Äôd heard them in my own head. Or had I really heard anything? It‚Äôd been a crazy day already and with how winded I was, I‚Äôm sure I wasn‚Äôt getting full oxygen to my brain. Couple that with my meds and trying to rationalize what might have been an insane decision, maybe my own brain manifested those words to explain why this place, which I‚Äôd never set foot in before previously, felt like home to me.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more‚Ä¶I believed them. I did feel safe. And as I crossed the threshold, I even felt somehow stronger. Breaths came easier as soon as I entered, and the box seemed a bit lighter as I carried it to the kitchen and set it on the counter. I beamed as I surveyed my new kingdom. Empty for the moment, but soon to be filled with the memories of young adulthood. Once I‚Äôd made a few friends in the area, I could definitely see throwing a few parties up here. The kitchen was modest, but I envisioned myself cooking a nice meal for a date sometime. I‚Äôd just need to meet a woman‚Ä¶and learn how to cook.\n\nFocusing a bit more on the fun that I could have in my new home I felt reinvigorated, and unloading the remainder of the truck went much more smoothly. Whether real or placebo, I found things always got easier the closer I got to 1737. I even managed to get the recliner upstairs by myself only thinking I might pass out twice.\n\nWith the truck finally empty, I took a quick look around and felt a pang of pride. It wasn‚Äôt much yet, but it was mine and the potential was more visceral than ever. Yet I didn‚Äôt linger long as I still had one more trip to the storage unit and a couple stops to make before I could really start to get things set up. Then when I shut the door and turned the key again to lock it, I thought I heard something again‚Ä¶the faintest whisper.\n\n‚Äú*Don‚Äôt leave*.‚Äù\n\nBut of course, I didn‚Äôt actually hear that‚Ä¶did I? Just the exhaustion of the day‚Ä¶my own brain telling me to settle down‚Ä¶maybe take a nap. I muttered aloud, although not quite sure to who‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúI just need to run and grab a few things quickly and then I‚Äôll be back for the night, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù\n\nNow I guess I was talking to myself, but who doesn‚Äôt from time to time? Nothing to worry about. Just motivating myself to make the last push. Though I couldn‚Äôt shake the smallest hint of sadness as I walked down the stairs.\n\nI drove a bit more quickly than normal back to the storage unit and loaded up the mattress and boxspring with haste. I‚Äôd already paid for the month there, so even though it was now empty, I decided I didn‚Äôt need to deal with cancelling the contract that day, and pulled out my phone to search for the closest fast food joint.\n\nFrustratingly, the line at the drive-thru was very long, and it seemed everyone was ordering for at least a family of four. The line inside looked no better, so I decided to wait it out, increasingly annoyed with each passing minute that things just wouldn‚Äôt move faster. Didn‚Äôt they know that I needed to get back home?\n\nFeeling the restaurant had failed miserably at the definition of fast, I did finally receive something that I hoped would at least meet the definition of food, and sped off to find the nearest gas station. Quickly, I scanned the aisles and grabbed snacks and drinks that I‚Äôm certain had zero nutritional value and made my way to the counter. Unfortunately I‚Äôd have to tell my mom that they didn‚Äôt have any carrots at the gas station. The cashier couldn‚Äôt work fast enough for me, and by the time he‚Äôd rung up my items and the pack of smokes I asked for, I felt like I was running late.\n\nI‚Äôm certain I sped quite a bit on the way back to the complex but luckily I wasn‚Äôt pulled over, and finally parked back in front of Building 17. I decided I‚Äôd drop the food in the apartment first and then come back down and get the mattress and boxspring. Then took the stairs two at a time to reach 1737. That familiar electric feeling washed over me as I turned the key, and without having to hear it, I said to myself, ‚ÄúI am safe here,‚Äù before crossing the threshold once more.\n\nDropping the food, I went to grab the box spring first as it was much lighter than the mattress and was able to get that up and into the bedroom with relative ease. The mattress, however, proved to be the most awkward and difficult thing I‚Äôd tried to get up the stairs yet. Far heavier than it looked, and cumbersome to carry for one person, I struggled just to get it up the first flight after having to drag it slightly up the last step. I paused on the first floor to catch my breath when from behind me I heard,\n\n‚ÄúDo you need some help?‚Äù\n\nThis time I was certain it was an actual voice and to my relief, when I turned around I saw a young woman standing just a few feet away. My initial shock from having heard no one approach waned as I realized she looked to be about my age and she was undeniably gorgeous. Maybe I‚Äôd just always had a thing for Latin women, but her dark hair and eyes, curves, and the confidence she carried herself with checked every box on my list. I became rapidly aware of my own stench from moving all day and took a couple steps back before replying.\n\n‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶hey, hi, uh‚Ä¶I do need to take it up to the top floor, but I can get it there myself, don‚Äôt worry about it if you‚Äôre on your way out.‚Äù\n\nI had to assume she was on her way out. There was only one stairwell and being I was taking up most of it currently, I would have seen her on her way up. I definitely didn‚Äôt want to inconvenience her if she had places to be and she wasn‚Äôt really dressed for heavy lifting‚Ä¶wearing a pair of joggers, house slippers, and a Pink Floyd t-shirt. Plus the caveman buried deep inside me wanted to prove I was strong enough to carry a mattress up three flights of stairs on my own (as I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a trait high on the list of things women look for in a mate).\n\n‚ÄúHa, on my way out? Nah I‚Äôm not going anywhere tonight. I had just heard there was a new tenant moving in today and I thought I might try and see if it was a hot guy. Are you helping him move?‚Äù\n\nAs my ego deflated like a weakly pinched off balloon, I replied, ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶I guess, sorry to disappoint, but he is me‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nShe laughed hard and said, ‚ÄúDude, I‚Äôm fucking with you. I was just going to take a little walk and saw your struggling ass. Now stop trying to be all macho and let me help you get that up the rest of the way. I do hella squats.‚Äù\n\nShe was incredibly disarming and I laughed too. Something about her seemed vaguely familiar but I couldn‚Äôt place it, and I was too tired to wrack my brains as to why. All I knew at that point was she wasn‚Äôt going to take no for an answer as she walked past me and grabbed the other end of the mattress.\n\nI said, ‚ÄúAlrighty then, I guess let‚Äôs do this on three. 1‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nBut before I could get to three, she squatted down and lifted her end with such ease I internally made a plan to sign up for a gym membership that week.\n\n‚ÄúVamonos cabron!‚Äù She exclaimed.\n\nAnd she took off for the stairs so quickly I had to jog a little bit to keep up. We flew through the next two flights like we were carrying a sack of feathers, and when we reached the third floor she made a backwards beeline straight for 1737, where she abruptly paused. We‚Äôd been moving so quickly, I actually slammed into my end of the mattress when she stopped and was surprised again at her strength as she didn‚Äôt even flinch.\n\nHer expression had changed from sarcastic and light to deadly serious. Taken aback by the sudden shift, I waited cautiously for her to speak. When she opened her mouth, her voice sounded different. It was undoubtedly hers, but the quality wasn‚Äôt the same. Instead of the spice it had had before, it was now very flat and mechanical, as she said‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúMay I enter?‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôd expected something much more serious based on her expression and tone and chuckled a bit as I responded.\n\n‚ÄúOh, yea of course. It should be unlocked.‚Äù\n\nHer serious expression immediately dropped and the sarcasm returned to her eyes. Even more, she looked slightly mischievous and flashed a broad smile.\n\nThe doors for the units had lever style handles and locked with a deadbolt and as I‚Äôd been running up and down the stairs, I had left the deadbolt open. Once I‚Äôd granted permission, she backed right up to the door and used her rather ample rear-end to depress the handle and push it open. We moved quickly through the unit as I followed her to my bedroom, where we set the mattress against the wall with the boxspring as I hadn‚Äôt yet assembled the bed frame.\n\nSo there I was‚Ä¶with an absolutely beautiful woman in my new bedroom on the very first night in it, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think one thing.\n\n‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt remember telling you which unit I was in? How‚Äôd you know to go right into this one?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm stalking you,‚Äù she said matter-of-factly.\n\nMy jaw dropped, and she cracked up again as she walked out to the living room.\n\n‚ÄúMan, you‚Äôre too easy! There‚Äôs only one unit open in this building. I knew which one was yours cause there‚Äôs literally only one unit you could have been moving into.‚Äù\n\nOf course‚Ä¶it had been a stupid question to even ask. I must have turned beet red because she was cracking up again and I couldn‚Äôt help but join her.\n\n‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶yea‚Ä¶you got me there.‚Äù I relented. ‚ÄúThanks for the help. Actually come to think of it, I never caught your name?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúValeria, but everybody just calls me Val.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell thanks again and sorry I don‚Äôt have anything to offer you as a proper thank you. I‚Äôve just got snacks and sodas from the gas station. After I‚Äôve had a chance to settle in, maybe I can buy a bottle of wine and we can split it on the balcony?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMake it tequila and we got a deal!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think I can manage that.‚Äù I grinned as she headed for the door. I was stunned. This morning I‚Äôd woken up in a crappy hotel, and now I was making dates to get tequila-drunk with my sexy new neighbor. ‚ÄúBy the way, my name is Dan.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was nice to meet you Dan. See you around the building.‚Äù She grabbed the back of my arm as she went to leave and I instantly knew why she‚Äôd seemed familiar earlier. The electrical sensation flowed from her fingertips this time, and began to pulse through my veins. The now expected feeling of comfort and safety that 1737 imbued started to sink in‚Ä¶but didn‚Äôt last. Something was different this time, and a new feeling instead seeded in the pit of my stomach. As someone who suffers from frequent panic attacks, I knew it instantly as dread. Horrifying, gut-wrenching, nauseating dread. As it swelled, I heard the voice once more.\n\n‚Äú*I have you now*.‚Äù\n\nJust then, I caught her eyes. Black. Nothing but black. Her irises and scleras had gone as black as her hair. My own eyes grew wider, beholding the nightmare and she smiled again. Too wide. Her teeth now sharp as razors. As the dread in my stomach accelerated its ascent into my throat, I wrenched my arm free of her grip, jumped back several feet, and shouted, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck!!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDude you are seriously so jumpy, that the first time a woman‚Äôs ever touched you?‚Äù\n\nShe was laughing at me again, features returned completely to normal. As quickly as it onset, my dread had evaporated and immediately I began trying to reconcile what'd just happened. Obviously, what I‚Äôd just seen couldn‚Äôt have been real, could it?",

        "text": "Did you know in some states landlords aren‚Äôt required to disclose murders in their units to prospective tenants? I didn‚Äôt.  \n\n**Chapter 1**\n\nThe summer after I graduated from college I landed my first real job. I‚Äôd just spent four years studying engineering, and I was elated to land a high-paying position with a Fortune 500 company so I could finally move out of my parents‚Äô house and strike it out on my own. Now that‚Äôs not to say that my parents were terrible to me and I was running from them, quite the opposite in fact. They‚Äôd merely raised me to be fiercely independent, and now that they‚Äôd helped me get through school, it was time to start paying my own way.\n\nMy new job required me to move out of state, which really wasn‚Äôt a big concern. I‚Äôd gone to school nearly equidistant from my parents‚Äô home as I would be in my new city, and I knew I could always make it back for a weekend if I was starting to feel homesick or lonely. However, where I was moving I didn‚Äôt know anybody, so it would be the first time that I would be living truly on my own. In college I was in a fraternity so I'd always had at least three or four roommates, and while they‚Äôre some of the best guys I‚Äôve ever known, they were quite shit at things like dishes, vacuuming, and not vomiting behind the couch. Needless to say at this point in my life, I was actually very excited to have a place all to myself. \n\nIf you know anything about the midwest, you‚Äôll know that some cities merely exist because a large company settled there a hundred or so years ago. This was true of where I was moving. Details on the company are superfluous to the story, suffice to say that nearly everyone in this area works for the same one and they import people from all over the world to work for them. Most folks move to this area in May right after they graduate from college, but the role I was hired for did not open until August. Therefore, by the time I moved to the area housing options had become a bit limited. Places I viewed were either wildly expensive or so dumpy that the roaches in them were looking for alternate accommodations.\n\nLiving out of a hotel and searching in vain for days, on a Saturday morning I finally stumbled upon a listing for an apartment that looked almost new from the photos online, was within my price range, and was near my new office. I was a bit surprised as I‚Äôd actually called the office for this complex just a couple weeks prior and they‚Äôd told me most of their tenants were on one-year leases and they likely wouldn‚Äôt have any availability until December. Thinking I‚Äôd just gotten incredibly lucky, I called the office again and I was forwarded along to the Property Manager. \n\n‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶Hi, yes I‚Äôm calling to inquire about the available unit I see posted on your website. I called a week or so ago and I was told you wouldn‚Äôt have any units available until around December, so I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs really available or some sort of glitch.‚Äù\n\nA woman‚Äôs voice replied to me. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶Hi‚Ä¶yes‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt realize they‚Äôd have it up on the website already. Umm‚Ä¶yes I suppose the unit is available‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôd made a lot of these calls recently so I was used to how they‚Äôd normally go at this point‚Ä¶typically a rundown of the complex, the amenities of the unit, and the rent details would follow but this felt different. She gave me none of this information and instead sounded hesitant to say they even had a unit available. Maybe customer service just wasn‚Äôt her forte. \n\n‚ÄúGreat! I‚Äôm in a bit of a crunch here, I start my new job Monday and haven‚Äôt been able to locate housing yet, would it be possible for me to come and view the unit today?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶yes, I guess that would be possible‚Ä¶before we proceed though, are you employed by (the company everyone works for)? We can waive the application in that case, we just need to see proof of employment.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes! That‚Äôs the company I‚Äôm starting with Monday. That‚Äôs fantastic that you can waive the application! I‚Äôll bring proof of employment with me to the tour.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay. In that case, I can meet you at the apartment office in an hour and my name is Clara.‚Äù\n\nAnd with that she hung up. Once she‚Äôd heard who I was working for her hesitation had abated. I figured she‚Äôd just been concerned that I wouldn‚Äôt be a fit candidate for the unit and I might be wasting her time. \n\nI arrived at the apartment office almost exactly one hour after our conversation and found Clara waiting for me. She greeted me warmly enough, if not a bit abruptly‚Ä¶she was probably a bit annoyed with having to give a tour on a Saturday and wanted to get it over with. Fine by me I thought. I‚Äôd already looked into this complex before I‚Äôd heard they had no availability, and if this particular unit matched up with the photos online, I was pretty confident it‚Äôd be essentially perfect for me. Clara asked if I was ready to get started and it was then I noticed the bags under her eyes. I surmised she was likely exhausted from dealing with the bullshit that comes with managing a large apartment complex‚Ä¶getting thirty calls a day that a lightbulb was out or a toilet wouldn‚Äôt flush. \n\nWe hopped in a golf cart and headed to Building 17. I found out the available unit was on the third floor, number 1737. Well I guess you‚Äôd call it the third floor, I would have called it the fourth floor, but this complex designated the lowest level as the ‚Äúground‚Äù floor, so the same apartment on that floor would have been designated as 1707. Either way, 1737 was on the top floor of the building and for me this was perfect. I‚Äôd never liked the idea of someone being able to look right into my windows as they walked by and from what I could see on the ride over to Building 17, many of the tenants liked to walk around for exercise.\n\nAs we approached the building, I noticed things got‚Ä¶quieter. The rest of the complex was bustling with life. Adults talking, children playing, dogs barking, but the closer we got to 17, the ambient noise seemed to fade to a dull hum. ‚ÄòStrange,‚Äô I thought, but maybe the tenants in this particular building were just not as social. Truthfully I‚Äôm fairly introverted, so I didn‚Äôt mind that it looked like I‚Äôd be living on the quiet side of town‚Ä¶I‚Äôd had enough socializing for a lifetime in college. \n\nClara parked the golf cart but didn‚Äôt get out. There was a heaviness to her presence and I couldn‚Äôt help asking, ‚Äúis something wrong?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶the last tenants of 1737‚Ä¶it was so‚Ä¶they just left so suddenly.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶did they give a reason why? You‚Äôre not about to show me a place full of black mold or something, are you?‚Äù I chuckled. \n\n‚ÄúNo, no, nothing like that. The place has been cleaned and inspected top to bottom in the last week and no one could find a single issue with it. The tenants didn‚Äôt give a reason for leaving to be honest. In fact, they didn‚Äôt even call us until they were back in their home country.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúReally? That‚Äôs crazy! So they just packed up and left?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNo, see that‚Äôs just the thing‚Ä¶they didn‚Äôt even pack most of their stuff‚Ä¶it looked like they just grabbed some essentials and small valuables maybe‚Ä¶hard to tell really‚Ä¶place was kinda ransacked. They‚Äôd signed a one-year least just two months prior and seemed ecstatic about their new lives here in America. Young couple‚Ä¶they were talking about starting a family and then they just left. We didn‚Äôt even realize they were gone until the wife called us and told us she didn‚Äôt care what we did with their things‚Ä¶just asked us to send us whatever paperwork and billing she‚Äôd need to sign and pay-off to break the lease and to please never contact her again. That was two weeks ago.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWow! When I saw a place opened up here I figured someone broke their lease early, but I guessed they‚Äôd just gotten another job somewhere or something. Never imagined something so‚Ä¶dramatic.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYea, to be honest it‚Äôs been a rough couple of weeks getting all their stuff cleared out and getting the place ready for a new tenant. For some reason I can‚Äôt seem to get a crew to work in there for more than a day so I‚Äôve had to use several. Hard to find good help and all I guess. Anyway, sorry again, like I said it‚Äôs been stressful around here recently and I was just surprised to have someone call me about seeing the place so soon. We can go take a look now if you‚Äôd like?‚Äù \n\nThis was definitely more than I was expecting and set off a few alarm bells considering they‚Äôd left in such an abnormal fashion, but I was desperate to find housing by this point. Also, I recollected I once had a boss that just up and moved to Colorado one day and never told anyone about it or even quit his job‚Ä¶just stopped showing up to work and we never saw him again. We only found out where he went via social media. Sometimes people just do weird shit, I reasoned. Maybe one of the previous tenants did get a new job back home and they were going to be making so much money that they just planned to buy all new stuff. That had to be it‚Ä¶just some rich dickheads left their mess behind for someone else to clean up and all it meant was I was going to get a great new place just before I started my new job.\n\nI told Clara I was ready to go check the place out and we ascended the stairs to 1737. As she put the key in the lock, I noticed the slightest reluctance‚Ä¶just a fraction of a second before she turned the key and opened the door. ‚ÄòShe really doesn‚Äôt want to be here‚Ä¶‚Äô I thought. However, any misgivings I had were quickly washed away as I entered and found it was everything I could have hoped for. Just as the photos online had intimated, it was nearly new inside. In fact, had Clara not told me there‚Äôd been at least five previous tenants, I would have never known it wasn‚Äôt a new build. She told me they had freshly painted and installed new carpets (standard procedure when a tenant moves out) and I‚Äôd have almost 1000 square feet all to myself. I couldn‚Äôt believe anyone would want to abandon this place, as by all accounts it appeared to be in perfect condition, and even had a balcony I could use to spy on the neighbors. The only thing I noticed that seemed a bit off was the faint smell of ozone, like there was an electrical issue of some kind. Clara assured me that, while she could smell it too, she‚Äôd had an electrician thoroughly check the unit and he‚Äôd reported everything was up to code and there was nothing to worry about. \n\nWith that, I‚Äôd seen and heard enough. I was ready to sign away the next year of my life and start moving in. It was odd, but while I could tell Clara seemed uncomfortable just being in the unit‚Ä¶shifting her weight constantly‚Ä¶her eyes darting to the corners of the room‚Ä¶I felt inherently at home. I‚Äôd only ever experienced that feeling at my parents‚Äô house before, just the sense of belonging‚Ä¶like the apartment itself wanted me there. I told Clara as much, and she gave me a weak nod of approval before she asked if we could return to the office to finalize the paperwork. As we were leaving, she told me she‚Äôd send someone out to fix the ‚Äúoverzealous‚Äù AC as soon as possible and apologized for it being freezing in there, but I normally run hot and told her I had felt perfectly natural while inside. \n\nAs promised, this complex worked with new hires to my company all the time and all I needed to do was show Clara my offer letter with the salary I‚Äôd be making, sign the one-year lease, and cough up the security deposit and first month‚Äôs rent before she handed me the keys to 1737. Apparently they trusted that the company was doing a thorough background check on new employees so they didn‚Äôt really need to one themselves for new tenants. \n\nI couldn‚Äôt believe it. Just that morning I had been having a mild anxiety attack wondering if I was going to be stuck living in a hotel for months, and now I had a place to call home. Expediently, I shot back to the hotel, grabbed what little I had there, checked out, and pointed my truck in the direction of my storage unit. \n\nI was intent on moving in as quickly as possible, which given how few belongings I‚Äôd brought from my parents‚Äô was not going to be difficult. In fact, I was nearly able to pack it all into one truckload and would only have to return for the mattress and box spring. Given this, on my first run to 1737, I mulled over all the furniture I‚Äôd need to buy before I invited over any guests. Currently I‚Äôd only be able to offer a seat on my lap in the recliner or a spot on my bed, which would be awkward at best for any new friends and a touch ‚Äúforward‚Äù for any dates I might bring home. I smirked thinking through several of these scenarios as I parked my truck in front of Building 17.\n\nWhile I‚Äôd initially been excited by the prospect of living on the third floor, now that I was staring down the barrel of hauling my net worth up three flights of stairs alone, I had my first moment of trepidation. And without warning, that trepidation started to spiral into a full-blown panic attack. Unfortunately, I suffer from a severe anxiety and panic disorder, but I‚Äôd been uncharacteristically calm with everything up until this very moment. But, now that I had just a second to stop and think, my mind spiraled into a frenzy. ‚ÄòI‚Äôd only been in the unit for ten minutes tops, I signed the paperwork with nary a question‚Ä¶did I even check under the bed in the hotel room and make sure I hadn‚Äôt lost a sock? What the hell did I just do?!‚Äô Something about the apartment must have seduced my synapses because I couldn‚Äôt fathom how I‚Äôd gotten this far without a second thought.\n\nDesperately, I jumped out of the truck and tried to locate where I‚Äôd tossed my bag from the hotel. My panic attack meds were buried somewhere in there and I had a feeling this one was going to require a double-dose. My psychiatrist had advised me only to take them as needed and really only to take one, but I found that that sometimes still left me a bit on edge and I took a second one anyway. As I shakily choked down the pills, my phone started to ring and I saw an incoming call from Mom. \n\n‚ÄúHey Mom.‚Äù \n\nI tried to sound confident, but mothers always know when something‚Äôs wrong.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? How‚Äôs the apartment hunt going? Are you still having trouble finding a place?‚Äù \n\nOh my god, I hadn‚Äôt even called my parents! I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Yea I was independent and I wanted to start behaving like a real adult but for a decision this big, I‚Äôd normally at least have called my mom first. ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs gotten into me?‚Äô I wondered. \n\n‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know what came over me today. I found a place and took a tour and just signed the paperwork without really thinking about it. I was literally about to start moving stuff in when I started having a panic attack. It‚Äôs not like me at all, I normally have to have every question answered‚Ä¶but something about the place‚Ä¶I just got a feeling, it felt like being home with you and Dad.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay honey‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to need you to try and take a few deep breaths for me‚Ä¶let‚Äôs talk through this. Did you take your medication?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYes, I just took it‚Ä¶I‚Äôll sit back in the front seat while I wait for it to kick in and we can talk.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúOkay, so let me just ask a few questions. Is it a place in one of the complexes you showed me before?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs in that nice one that said they wouldn‚Äôt have availability until December. They had a unit unexpectedly open up, so I called and took a tour and holy shit, I live here now I guess‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay, I get why you‚Äôre panicking right now, but that actually sounds like a good thing! You‚Äôd already looked into that place before‚Ä¶it‚Äôs probably why you didn‚Äôt feel the need to ask a ton of questions. And I know you‚Äôve been stressed trying to find a place, so if it felt like home, I can understand why you just jumped on the opportunity. If you‚Äôre really stressed about it though, email me a copy of the lease and I‚Äôll read through it to make sure it‚Äôs all on the up-and-up, alright?‚Äù \n\nMy mom worked for the city back home in their public housing sector and was extremely well versed in lease agreements. I‚Äôm not sure if it was her offer or the meds starting to kick in, but I felt my heart rate start to decrease and I began processing information rationally again. So what if it had been a bit of an impulse decision? She was right. I‚Äôd looked into the complex previously, many people from my company lived there, I could afford it, and it was far nicer than the hotel I‚Äôd been staying at even if I was only going to have bachelor pad levels of amenities for a few days.\n\n‚ÄúThanks Mom, yea that helps. They did email me my signed copy of the lease, I‚Äôll send it over to you this evening when I get settled in a bit. I need to start hauling stuff up the stairs now. I have one more run to the storage unit to make and then I‚Äôll grab some takeout for dinner‚Ä¶probably stop in a store and grab some sodas and chips to snack on as well.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúMaybe get some healthy snacks too? Carrots?‚Äù She replied.\n\n‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù I snickered, ‚ÄúI have to run or I‚Äôm going to run out of daylight here. Thanks again, love you!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLove you too, oh and take some pictures of the new place and send them to me and your Dad!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWill do!‚Äù\n\nShe hung up and after a few more deep breaths, I willed myself out of the truck, grabbed the first box, and headed towards the stairs. I was aware there wasn‚Äôt an elevator from the tour earlier that day, but I hadn‚Äôt truly anticipated just how much that was going to suck until I carried up that first box (which happened to be full of dishes). In my youthful and testosterone-addled mind, I remember thinking something along the lines of, ‚Äòstairs will be good for me, I‚Äôll get some extra exercise, maybe I‚Äôll even drop a few pounds!‚Äô This, I found, was a very stupid thought. Stairs are stupid, and I was even more stupid for being excited about stairs.\n\nI guess you could say that I was pretty out of shape at the time as I‚Äôd definitely spent a lot more time in the lab and at the bars than in the gym while I was in college. Also, I still hadn‚Äôt quite kicked my smoking habit so I was huffing pretty aggressively by the time I approached the door for 1737.\n\nI stuck my key in the door and as soon as it bottomed out in the lock, I had the strangest sensation wash over me. Almost like I‚Äôd made an electrical connection at my fingertips and it flowed through every atom in my body. The instinctual feeling that this was home returned‚Ä¶and I didn‚Äôt just feel it‚Ä¶now I heard it. The softest voice.\n\n‚Äú*You are safe here*.‚Äù\n\nIt happened so quickly, and so quietly, I barely caught the words. I swung my head around to see if someone had snuck up on me and finding no one, realized I‚Äôd heard them in my own head. Or had I really heard anything? It‚Äôd been a crazy day already and with how winded I was, I‚Äôm sure I wasn‚Äôt getting full oxygen to my brain. Couple that with my meds and trying to rationalize what might have been an insane decision, maybe my own brain manifested those words to explain why this place, which I‚Äôd never set foot in before previously, felt like home to me. \n\nWhat‚Äôs more‚Ä¶I believed them. I did feel safe. And as I crossed the threshold, I even felt somehow stronger. Breaths came easier as soon as I entered, and the box seemed a bit lighter as I carried it to the kitchen and set it on the counter. I beamed as I surveyed my new kingdom. Empty for the moment, but soon to be filled with the memories of young adulthood. Once I‚Äôd made a few friends in the area, I could definitely see throwing a few parties up here. The kitchen was modest, but I envisioned myself cooking a nice meal for a date sometime. I‚Äôd just need to meet a woman‚Ä¶and learn how to cook. \n\nFocusing a bit more on the fun that I could have in my new home I felt reinvigorated, and unloading the remainder of the truck went much more smoothly. Whether real or placebo, I found things always got easier the closer I got to 1737. I even managed to get the recliner upstairs by myself only thinking I might pass out twice.  \n\nWith the truck finally empty, I took a quick look around and felt a pang of pride. It wasn‚Äôt much yet, but it was mine and the potential was more visceral than ever. Yet I didn‚Äôt linger long as I still had one more trip to the storage unit and a couple stops to make before I could really start to get things set up. Then when I shut the door and turned the key again to lock it, I thought I heard something again‚Ä¶the faintest whisper. \n\n‚Äú*Don‚Äôt leave*.‚Äù\n\nBut of course, I didn‚Äôt actually hear that‚Ä¶did I? Just the exhaustion of the day‚Ä¶my own brain telling me to settle down‚Ä¶maybe take a nap. I muttered aloud, although not quite sure to who‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúI just need to run and grab a few things quickly and then I‚Äôll be back for the night, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù\n\nNow I guess I was talking to myself, but who doesn‚Äôt from time to time? Nothing to worry about. Just motivating myself to make the last push. Though I couldn‚Äôt shake the smallest hint of sadness as I walked down the stairs. \n\nI drove a bit more quickly than normal back to the storage unit and loaded up the mattress and boxspring with haste. I‚Äôd already paid for the month there, so even though it was now empty, I decided I didn‚Äôt need to deal with cancelling the contract that day, and pulled out my phone to search for the closest fast food joint. \n\nFrustratingly, the line at the drive-thru was very long, and it seemed everyone was ordering for at least a family of four. The line inside looked no better, so I decided to wait it out, increasingly annoyed with each passing minute that things just wouldn‚Äôt move faster. Didn‚Äôt they know that I needed to get back home? \n\nFeeling the restaurant had failed miserably at the definition of fast, I did finally receive something that I hoped would at least meet the definition of food, and sped off to find the nearest gas station. Quickly, I scanned the aisles and grabbed snacks and drinks that I‚Äôm certain had zero nutritional value and made my way to the counter. Unfortunately I‚Äôd have to tell my mom that they didn‚Äôt have any carrots at the gas station. The cashier couldn‚Äôt work fast enough for me, and by the time he‚Äôd rung up my items and the pack of smokes I asked for, I felt like I was running late. \n\nI‚Äôm certain I sped quite a bit on the way back to the complex but luckily I wasn‚Äôt pulled over, and finally parked back in front of Building 17. I decided I‚Äôd drop the food in the apartment first and then come back down and get the mattress and boxspring. Then took the stairs two at a time to reach 1737. That familiar electric feeling washed over me as I turned the key, and without having to hear it, I said to myself, ‚ÄúI am safe here,‚Äù before crossing the threshold once more. \n\nDropping the food, I went to grab the box spring first as it was much lighter than the mattress and was able to get that up and into the bedroom with relative ease. The mattress, however, proved to be the most awkward and difficult thing I‚Äôd tried to get up the stairs yet. Far heavier than it looked, and cumbersome to carry for one person, I struggled just to get it up the first flight after having to drag it slightly up the last step. I paused on the first floor to catch my breath when from behind me I heard, \n\n‚ÄúDo you need some help?‚Äù\n\nThis time I was certain it was an actual voice and to my relief, when I turned around I saw a young woman standing just a few feet away. My initial shock from having heard no one approach waned as I realized she looked to be about my age and she was undeniably gorgeous. Maybe I‚Äôd just always had a thing for Latin women, but her dark hair and eyes, curves, and the confidence she carried herself with checked every box on my list. I became rapidly aware of my own stench from moving all day and took a couple steps back before replying. \n\n‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶hey, hi, uh‚Ä¶I do need to take it up to the top floor, but I can get it there myself, don‚Äôt worry about it if you‚Äôre on your way out.‚Äù \n\nI had to assume she was on her way out. There was only one stairwell and being I was taking up most of it currently, I would have seen her on her way up. I definitely didn‚Äôt want to inconvenience her if she had places to be and she wasn‚Äôt really dressed for heavy lifting‚Ä¶wearing a pair of joggers, house slippers, and a Pink Floyd t-shirt. Plus the caveman buried deep inside me wanted to prove I was strong enough to carry a mattress up three flights of stairs on my own (as I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a trait high on the list of things women look for in a mate).\n\n‚ÄúHa, on my way out? Nah I‚Äôm not going anywhere tonight. I had just heard there was a new tenant moving in today and I thought I might try and see if it was a hot guy. Are you helping him move?‚Äù\n\nAs my ego deflated like a weakly pinched off balloon, I replied, ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶I guess, sorry to disappoint, but he is me‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nShe laughed hard and said, ‚ÄúDude, I‚Äôm fucking with you. I was just going to take a little walk and saw your struggling ass. Now stop trying to be all macho and let me help you get that up the rest of the way. I do hella squats.‚Äù \n\nShe was incredibly disarming and I laughed too. Something about her seemed vaguely familiar but I couldn‚Äôt place it, and I was too tired to wrack my brains as to why. All I knew at that point was she wasn‚Äôt going to take no for an answer as she walked past me and grabbed the other end of the mattress. \n\nI said, ‚ÄúAlrighty then, I guess let‚Äôs do this on three. 1‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nBut before I could get to three, she squatted down and lifted her end with such ease I internally made a plan to sign up for a gym membership that week.\n\n‚ÄúVamonos cabron!‚Äù She exclaimed.\n\nAnd she took off for the stairs so quickly I had to jog a little bit to keep up. We flew through the next two flights like we were carrying a sack of feathers, and when we reached the third floor she made a backwards beeline straight for 1737, where she abruptly paused. We‚Äôd been moving so quickly, I actually slammed into my end of the mattress when she stopped and was surprised again at her strength as she didn‚Äôt even flinch. \n\nHer expression had changed from sarcastic and light to deadly serious. Taken aback by the sudden shift, I waited cautiously for her to speak. When she opened her mouth, her voice sounded different. It was undoubtedly hers, but the quality wasn‚Äôt the same. Instead of the spice it had had before, it was now very flat and mechanical, as she said‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúMay I enter?‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôd expected something much more serious based on her expression and tone and chuckled a bit as I responded.\n\n‚ÄúOh, yea of course. It should be unlocked.‚Äù\n\nHer serious expression immediately dropped and the sarcasm returned to her eyes. Even more, she looked slightly mischievous and flashed a broad smile. \n\nThe doors for the units had lever style handles and locked with a deadbolt and as I‚Äôd been running up and down the stairs, I had left the deadbolt open. Once I‚Äôd granted permission, she backed right up to the door and used her rather ample rear-end to depress the handle and push it open. We moved quickly through the unit as I followed her to my bedroom, where we set the mattress against the wall with the boxspring as I hadn‚Äôt yet assembled the bed frame. \n\nSo there I was‚Ä¶with an absolutely beautiful woman in my new bedroom on the very first night in it, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think one thing.\n\n‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt remember telling you which unit I was in? How‚Äôd you know to go right into this one?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm stalking you,‚Äù she said matter-of-factly. \n\nMy jaw dropped, and she cracked up again as she walked out to the living room. \n\n‚ÄúMan, you‚Äôre too easy! There‚Äôs only one unit open in this building. I knew which one was yours cause there‚Äôs literally only one unit you could have been moving into.‚Äù \n\nOf course‚Ä¶it had been a stupid question to even ask. I must have turned beet red because she was cracking up again and I couldn‚Äôt help but join her. \n\n‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶yea‚Ä¶you got me there.‚Äù I relented. ‚ÄúThanks for the help. Actually come to think of it, I never caught your name?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúValeria, but everybody just calls me Val.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell thanks again and sorry I don‚Äôt have anything to offer you as a proper thank you. I‚Äôve just got snacks and sodas from the gas station. After I‚Äôve had a chance to settle in, maybe I can buy a bottle of wine and we can split it on the balcony?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúMake it tequila and we got a deal!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think I can manage that.‚Äù I grinned as she headed for the door. I was stunned. This morning I‚Äôd woken up in a crappy hotel, and now I was making dates to get tequila-drunk with my sexy new neighbor. ‚ÄúBy the way, my name is Dan.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was nice to meet you Dan. See you around the building.‚Äù She grabbed the back of my arm as she went to leave and I instantly knew why she‚Äôd seemed familiar earlier. The electrical sensation flowed from her fingertips this time, and began to pulse through my veins. The now expected feeling of comfort and safety that 1737 imbued started to sink in‚Ä¶but didn‚Äôt last. Something was different this time, and a new feeling instead seeded in the pit of my stomach. As someone who suffers from frequent panic attacks, I knew it instantly as dread. Horrifying, gut-wrenching, nauseating dread. As it swelled, I heard the voice once more.\n\n‚Äú*I have you now*.‚Äù\n\nJust then, I caught her eyes. Black. Nothing but black. Her irises and scleras had gone as black as her hair. My own eyes grew wider, beholding the nightmare and she smiled again. Too wide. Her teeth now sharp as razors. As the dread in my stomach accelerated its ascent into my throat, I wrenched my arm free of her grip, jumped back several feet, and shouted, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck!!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDude you are seriously so jumpy, that the first time a woman‚Äôs ever touched you?‚Äù \n\nShe was laughing at me again, features returned completely to normal. As quickly as it onset, my dread had evaporated and immediately I began trying to reconcile what'd just happened. Obviously, what I‚Äôd just seen couldn‚Äôt have been real, could it?",

I had escaped from Hell. I looked around the cemetery, frowning. Scanning the mind of the child I possessed, I gained his name- ‚ÄúKurt‚Äù- and his address, among other critical information. I found myself in Maine, in the absolute middle of nowhere. But it would have to do.\n\nThe friend stared at me with wide eyes, clear anxiety marring his expression.\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look good at all, man,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou look pale as shit all of a sudden.‚Äù My body wavered and I tripped, nearly falling before the friend grabbed my arm and steadied me. Scanning the mind of the kid, I found the name of his friend.\n\n‚ÄúThanks, Andre,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMaybe it was just something I ate. A little touch of food poisoning or something. I guess I really don‚Äôt feel that good. I‚Äôm just going to head home.‚Äù Andre nodded seriously at me. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick up the ouija board and candles and everything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúToo bad we didn‚Äôt get to see anything supernatural happen, huh?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah, too bad‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, walking away. If only he knew.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, as I started walking down the side of the road under the streetlights, I saw the silhouette of an angel, like the ones I had seen torturing people in Hell. Its wings spread out massively behind it twenty feet in each direction, softly swaying to and fro like a flag in a slight breeze. But when I turned my eyes to look directly at it, there was nothing there besides an ancient oak tree with countless branches reaching up to the moon-lit sky.\n\n‚ÄúMy eyes are playing tricks on me,‚Äù I said to myself. Then I remembered the horrifying thousand-voices of the angel as it turned its empty space of a face towards me, how it had said to me, ‚ÄúYou will always return to us in the end.‚Äù I shuddered. It felt like it had been staring directly into my soul, judging me- and finding me wanting.\n\nI had never done psychedelic drugs in my life, but I felt like I was on what I imagined LSD or peyote to feel like. I kept seeing figures out of the corner of my eyes, shadows running across the street, faces in the trees and eyes staring out from the surrounding forest, but whenever I turned my attention to them, they disappeared. It was like something was mocking me, always staying directly out of the view of the center of my vision but playing games on the periphery instead.\n\nThe ground began to tremble, as if an earthquake were starting. I heard running from behind me, and turned to see Andre standing there, sweating and out of breath.\n\n‚ÄúGod, did you just feel that?‚Äù he said, his eyes widening with fear. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre having an earthquake. We don‚Äôt have earthquakes in fucking Maine! What the hell is going on right now?‚Äù He was right. When Maine had earthquakes, they were generally so small no one felt them. But right now it was just getting more and more intense.\n\nTrees began to fall in the forest, the smashing branches creating an echoing cacophony that blotted out of all Andre‚Äôs words afterwards. I saw his lips moving, but I couldn‚Äôt hear anything besides the crashing of the earth, the collapsing of crypts in the nearby cemetery and trees continuously breaking apart.\n\nAll of a sudden, I felt a whooshing sensation and heard deafening crashing inches away to my left. A massive pine tree branch crashed into the ground, its smaller branches slicing up my shirt and back as it fell. At that moment, Kurt and I began to run to the only open area that was close- the cemetery. It seemed the only place where we wouldn‚Äôt get crushed to death by falling trees and branches. We didn‚Äôt even have to speak to each other, but both sprinted in a blind panic, breathing hard, my heart beating out of my chest.\n\nThe shaking behind us was getting so bad that the road was starting to crack. We sprinted as fast as we could, nearly tripping a few times as the pavement heaved and split around us and more branches fell in the distance. The forest around us sounded like it was coming apart. I heard alarms going off in the distance, first car alarms and then the wailing of a tornado siren from the center of downtown. People were definitely waking up, noticing something was very wrong, and I had a feeling it was all my fault.\n\nAs we ran into the cemetery, I first began to see for certain that this was not a normal earthquake. Hands were reaching out of the ground, some skeletal, others with some flesh still hanging on to their cracking bones. I could see the muscles and tendons of those closest as they moved with frantic energy and unbelievable speed, shoveling dirt away and ripping a hole open as they emerged from underneath. Crypts flew open as bodies bashed through the doors with superhuman strength, sending shards of stone flying in all directions.\n\nFrom the eyes of every corpse, I could see pure blackness, just like the blackness of the faces of the angels who controlled Hell. The blackness was piercing, shimmering, beyond any simple absence of light- it was as if a hole was actually ripping in reality right where the eyes of the corpses used to be. And all of the hundreds of them stared directly at me, ignoring Andre completely.\n\nThen, in an instant, the shaking stopped. The silence was deafening and eerie in the aftermath of such a cataclysm. All I could hear was the ringing in my ears and the pounding of my heart.\n\n‚ÄúYou will return to us!‚Äù the corpse in front of me shrieked, his voice sounding like thousands of deep, distorted voices overlapping. He was a half-decomposed elderly man in an expensive Armani suit, strands of white hair still hanging to the papery skin of his skull, his teeth and the muscles of his jaw showing through the decayed holes in his cheeks as he spoke. ‚ÄúDo you need more rope to hang yourself with, sinner? Will you not accept your fate? You dare take the body of an *innocent child* just to fulfill your own selfish desires and try to escape the fate that you deserve?‚Äù \n\nAnother corpse began to move in from my right, a young woman who looked much fresher, but had a massive bullet hole through her forehead. Otherwise, she almost could have still been alive. Yet she spoke with the same voice of the other corpse- the cacophony of many beings blending their vocalizations together almost, but not completely, in sync. Her screaming was so loud I felt my chest vibrating, my heart thudding painfully in my chest as the corpses closed in around me.\n\n‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you done enough, Jay? You are rotted from the inside. Only Hell will purify your evil. Return to us. Give up the body of the child, now!‚Äù I felt around Kurt‚Äôs pockets, having only one idea to get out of this situation. I knew I couldn‚Äôt return with them. And in his right pocket, I found what I knew would be there. A pocket knife.\n\nGrabbing Andre quickly, I flicked open the knife and put it to his throat. \n\n‚ÄúStand the FUCK back!‚Äù I screamed as loud as I could, my throat hurting from the sheer force of my yelling. The circle of corpses stopped moving in on me, but my heart was still beating too fast, my hands trembling so badly I thought I might drop the knife on the ground. I wanted to throw up, but I managed to avoid it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious right now! I will fucking KILL this kid right in front of you all if you don‚Äôt let me go!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHave you gone so far down, Jay?‚Äù the elderly man said to me in the voice of an angel. ‚ÄúYou know you must return to us eventually. Why accumulate more evil to repay? Your kind never learns. But you‚Äôre not a stupid man. You must know we cannot allow you to stay here in the body of this innocent boy.‚Äù He shook his head, almost like a disappointed parent. My hand shook so bad that I sliced Andre‚Äôs skin slightly. Andre yelped, and a few drops of blood ran down his neck.\n\n‚ÄúKurt, what the fuck man?‚Äù he whispered to me. ‚ÄúLet me go. This is crazy. You don‚Äôt have to do this. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Kurt!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI possessed him during your little ritual with the ouija board, but I‚Äôm not him. And I am *not* going back to Hell. No way. Andre, you have no idea what these *things* do to people there. They pour lead down their throats, they hang them from every pole on the street, they burn them and cut them and torment them, then when their victims are too used up, they‚Äôre buried in a field, where they‚Äôre healed and come out of some massive eggplant just to do it all over again. How can anyone expect me to go back there? That‚Äôs totally insane! I would rather die!‚Äù\n\nAt that moment, a fleet of police cars and ambulances started to drive by, their lights flashing but their sirens off since there was no traffic out here, but they slammed on their brakes once they saw the massive crowd of people standing in the cemetery. The cop in the front car got out, looking confused. Then he saw that the people standing around us were not really people at all, with their decomposing bodies, black eyes and skeletal figures, and his jaw fell open.\n\n‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù he whispered. More cops got out behind him, all of them looking confused. Some pulled out their guns and started screaming orders at the walking bodies, while others got back in their cars and locked the doors, staring out in horror, unsure of what to do. Some of them called for backup on their radios. One cop got in his car and drove away like a madman, swerving between the ambulances and other police cars in front of him, his sirens now blaring. He looked like he was screaming inside the car and I think he flipped us off as he sped away. I suppressed a sudden urge to start laughing hysterically at this absurd scene. If I started laughing now, I might never stop. I felt like I was losing my mind under all the stress.\n\nI don‚Äôt know who started it, but one of the cops fired his gun as a few of the corpses started walking towards them, and all hell started breaking loose. The circle of corpses rushed at the police, and then all of the police started firing at once. The gunshots made my ears ring, and I heard a few bullets smash into the crypts and tombstones immediately to my left, whizzing right next to my head and chest. I let Andre go and ran for my life. I don‚Äôt know if he made it out of there or not. He might be dead for all I know.\n\nI scanned Kurt‚Äôs mind and found his house. He was only fourteen and so, of course, lived with his parents. But I needed a place to rest and think, and that was the only one nearby. I ran to the house, running up the stairs without speaking to anyone and locking the door behind me. Shaking, shivering, sick with fear and worry, I laid down on the bed and started to cry for myself and everything I had lost. I thought about my wife and my kid, my old life and how much I missed all of them, and I started sobbing uncontrollably, the tears staining the pillow as I screamed into it in desperation and anger.\n\nAs I write this up, I look out the windows and keep seeing the silhouettes of angels out of the corner of my eye. And now the ground feels like it is starting to shake. I think they‚Äôre coming for me. I wonder if I should keep running, or if I should just go with them to that sick place with the red clouds and the people constantly brought back to life just to be tortured all over again. I am thinking about taking Kurt‚Äôs parents hostage if I need to. The angels don‚Äôt seem to want to see innocents die, and that may be my only chance. I still have the pocketknife just in case, and there are plenty of bigger knives downstairs, if I decide it necessary.\n\nYet the voice of the angel from the cemetery keeps repeating in my head:\n\n*‚ÄúDo you need more rope to hang yourself with, sinner?‚Äù*",

You know, who disappeared last year?\" He quickly asked, ignoring my remark.\n\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" I rolled my eyes before staring at the door handle again.\n\n\nFrom all the stories I actually bothered to listen to, I'd recollected this much; John and Jon were best friends and room mates in college, Jon quickly excelled and became a superstar within his field, and John, even though he claims to have helped with a lot of Jon's projects, would be rapidly overshadowed and he eventually succumbed to bittersweet jealousy, ending their friendship and parting ways for good.\n\n\n\"Well,\" he continued. \"Back in 1999, Jon wrote a paper on how brain chemicals react when the body is subjected to immense pain...\"\n\n\nMy eyes quickly dart from the handle to his face.\n\n\n\"He wrote that the chemicals released during these painful experiences, are actually very similar to the chemicals released just before death.\" He shuffled on the spot before continuing. \"He claimed that once technology had reached a certain level, he'd predicted about 20 to 25 years, that we would have the capabilities to build a machine. A machine that could capture this moment and somehow harness these chemicals.\"\n\n\nI must admit, I was quite intrigued.\n\n\n\"Okaay?\"\n\n\n\"Wellll, I actually worked with him on the paper...*and* the machine.\"\n\n\n\"...What?\" I confusingly asked.\n\n\nHe lightly stroked the door with the back of his other hand and I honestly didn't know how to react. I took a hard gulp.\n\n\n\"What's behind the door, John?\"\n\n\nHe suddenly stopped stroking the door and looked up towards the ceiling like it was the nights sky. His face; serious. His voice; a whisper.\n\n\n\"...*Ghosts*.\"\n\n\nHe finally swung the door open.\n\n\nMy mouth dropped as I looked around...I struggled to comprehend what I was seeing.\n\n\nIn the centre of the room, was a large machine. It closely resembled that of an MRI-scanner, and a glass table with a fully naked and forever-twitching man laying upon it.\n\n\nThe machine was projecting some sort of electromagnetic-sphere, encasing both table and man in a translucent bubble.\n\n\nEvery single limb had either been snapped off or disjointed out of place, and every inch of his skin was covered with needles. This machine had somehow locked this man in a state of sheer agony.\n\n\nFloating from his body were thousands of thin and transparent strings, almost like a spiders-web, that were extending out to a translucent version of the same man. His ghostly face was full of despair and his eyes locked with mine.\n\n\n\"Hello Jon...\" Said John. He then turned to me with the widest grin and asked, \"Still think I'm crazy?\"",

        "text": "This was it. My swan song.\n\nMy name is Robert Grant.\n\nI just turned 73 last weekend and am enjoying my mornings at Zaza's sipping cappuccinos in my pajamas. I live in a quaint, nice apartment in Montreal and am almost never interested in leaving the comfort of it. I'm a retired P.I. 157 cases successfully closed, 14 left cold, and dozens I never took.\n\nBut my last case is one that continues to haunt me.\n\nOne of the 14 I left cold. I often think about it while sitting at Zaza's. It's one I've never told anyone about. I haven't been able to sleep lately and think it'd be best if I write it all out. It also happens to be the only supernatural case I worked on, one that made me a believer in many things, and one that almost killed me in more ways than I'd care to admit.\n\nIt all begins on the morning of August 12, 2019... already two years into my retirement.\n\n‚ÄúMr. Grant! Mr. Grant!‚Äù A man yelled outside the door of Apartment 712.\n\nI admit the smoke detector should have woken me. It was blaring throughout the entirety of the seventh floor of the apartment complex. I had been lying on the couch either napping or daydreaming‚Ä¶ or perhaps in a state somewhere in between.\n\nThe alarm continued until my neighbor Will came barreling through the front door, quickly distinguishing the smoky, near fire at the oven by waving a dish towel vigorously at the billowing smoke. I remember him pulling out a burnt, ashy black disc. I don't really remember putting the frozen pizza in the oven, to be honest.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be more careful, Mr. Grant,‚Äù William said to me.\n\n‚ÄúAstute observation,‚Äù I remember uttering under my breath.\n\n\"What were you doing in here anyway?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI was cooking. And resting my eyes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou usually do that at the same time?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\n\n\"No one was hurt, that‚Äôs all that matters. How about you come over for dinner tonight? Corrine‚Äôs making a turkey,\" he finally said.\n\nHe was always unsuccessfully trying to get me to come over to their apartment. If he promised we would sit in silence and watch a movie with pizzas, I might have occasionally said yes.\n\n‚ÄúA generous offer, William. But I'm quite booked today.\"\n\n‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ Well, let me know if you need help with anything this weekend,\" he said.\n\nI gave William a subtle nod of feigned appreciation and showed him out. The thing about William is that he has always been an acquaintance trying to become a friend, perhaps no greater flaw in someone. I'm certainly too old now for new friends, and I was too old then as well.\n\nI will admit I did tape up a piece of paper on the front door, a makeshift sign that read:\n\n***Make Sure Oven is Off***\n\nMy retirement routine then was not too different than it is now. I got dressed, made my way down the elevator, and began my morning routine across the street at Zaza's. But the morning changed when Frankie dropped off my cappuccino, scone, and newspaper. As I turned to the Arts section of the paper to look at movie reviews, I received a call that would change everything. From an old client of mine named Frankie.\n\n\"Yes?\" I answered.\n\n\"Look, I know you're retired, but I got a case that I think -\"\n\n\"No, no, Frankie. I'm a content old man.\"\n\n\"It's for a client that... Listen, I think it's a day's work.\"\n\n\"A day's work?\"\n\n\"It should be. But if it turns out to be more than that, it might be a case that'll make you believe in God. And the devil too.\"\n\nI remember looking at my cappuccino and scone, wondering if this silly call and my sheer curiosity would drag me away from my tranquil life.\n\n\"Details?\"\n\nFrankie laughed. He knew had me on the hook.\n\n\"Those will have to come in person. My client would prefer to discuss all of this in person. Today at  \n1 pm.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Picnic Basket. But let's meet at IFAR\"\n\nI remember hating that Frankie knew me so well. The Picnic Basket was a cozy sandwich shop in the arts district. Known for their beautifully delicious pastrami on rye. It also happened to be one of my favorite lunch spots in the entire city.\n\nIn the afternoon, I made it over to the junction triangle, passing all the art galleries that lined the streets, showcasing local and international works of all sorts. The buildings are all independently designed by great artists, mostly covered in glass, playing with the sunlight in unique ways.\n\nThe only eyesore of the area happened to be the building I was meeting Frankie and his client at. IFAR. The International Federation of Art Research. It's a tall, rather plain-looking building. But it also happens to be one of the most important agencies in the Art World.\n\nI stood outside of it for a few minutes before Frankie came out. Frankie is short and a bit rounder than he'd care to admit. But he's very pleasant and always seems to know people.\n\nWalking out with him was someone I had never met or even seen before. A woman. I remember thinking she had to be between 40-55. Very distinguished looking and was wearing a fur coat. I couldn't tell if it was real or faux. I just remember thinking it was odd since it was so warm out.\n\n\"Robert!\" Frankie yelled. \"How are you, my friend?\"\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n\"Famished. You guys?\" I joked, trying to lighten the mood, waiting for the introduction.\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" Frankie continued. \"This is Marla Chandler. My client.'\n\nMore handshakes.\n\n\"Robert Grant. Pleasure to meet you.\"\n\n\"I've heard so much about you already, Mr. Grant,\" she said extra politely. \"I look forward to working together.\"\n\n\"You two go to have lunch, talk about the case, and let me know if you're taking the case. I have a meeting I can't miss,\" Frankie explained, looking at me as he delivered the last bit.\n\nMarla and I walked to The Picnic Basket. We didn't talk much until we had ordered and sat across from each other in a small booth in the back. At first, we just made small talk. She was visiting from New York. She knew Frankie through connections in the art world. She was an art historian. Then our lunch specials came and we enjoyed those for a few minutes. The pastrami on rye was as perfect as ever.\n\nAnd finally, after all of the small talk about Frankie and IFAR, she seemed to get a more serious tone, way more serious than I was ever expecting. She leaned in closely, almost as if she was afraid someone was eavesdropping on us, and began a conversation I could have never been prepared for.\n\n\"Are you a man of faith?\" She asked me.\n\n\"I grew up Catholic,\" I shrugged. \"But I don't practice.\"\n\n\"Have you followed the Montreal Police's investigation into the missing children cases over the past year? There have been two here in the city recently. Ages 5 and 7.\"\n\n\"I can't say I have. Did they find them?\"\n\n\"No. You haven't heard about the investigation because there isn't one.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"There's been a handful more in Albany and Buffalo. I believe they're all connected.\"\n\n\"Were those on the news?\" I asked her, genuinely curious.\n\nI then quickly felt terrible I hadn't paid more attention to news outside the entertainment and arts industries. But Marla didn't seemed bothered by my answer. In fact, she grew much quieter all of a sudden, almost disappearing into herself.\n\n\"It's alright,\" I said. \"I think I'm tracking with you. Missing kids, a handful of them. And no one is reporting on it.\"\n\nThere was a long bit of silence as she contemplated if she was going to continue.\n\n\"I'm going to sound crazy. It took me four hours to convince Frankie I wasn't crazy.\"\n\nI laughed. I thought she was joking at first, but I quickly realized she wasn't.\n\n\"I believe the missing children... that they're all connected. There is a man I believe is running a trafficking ring. He's calling himself Osvaldo.\"\n\n\"Jesus.\"\n\n\"No...\" She said softly. \"Osvaldo is a fallen angel and I believe he is on Earth collecting children for Satan.\"\n\nI sat there speechless. I remember thinking I couldn't wait to slap Frankie for sending me on this lunch. I think she could tell she was losing me.\n\n\"No, Mr. Grant. You must believe me. I've studied him by many names in art. That's my background. There are stories of collectors of innocent souls who work for the devil.\n\n\"Look, I think I could maybe help you out... if you had some sort of proof.\"\n\nA lightbulb went off for her.\n\n\"Of course!\" She almost yelled, frantically looking through her purse for something.\n\nThen she stopped rummaging and slowly turned back towards me, holding something in her hands.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*",

        "text": "This was it. My swan song.\n\nMy name is Robert Grant. \n\nI just turned 73 last weekend and am enjoying my mornings at Zaza's sipping cappuccinos in my pajamas. I live in a quaint, nice apartment in Montreal and am almost never interested in leaving the comfort of it. I'm a retired P.I. 157 cases successfully closed, 14 left cold, and dozens I never took. \n\nBut my last case is one that continues to haunt me. \n\nOne of the 14 I left cold. I often think about it while sitting at Zaza's. It's one I've never told anyone about. I haven't been able to sleep lately and think it'd be best if I write it all out. It also happens to be the only supernatural case I worked on, one that made me a believer in many things, and one that almost killed me in more ways than I'd care to admit. \n\nIt all begins on the morning of August 12, 2019... already two years into my retirement.\n\n‚ÄúMr. Grant! Mr. Grant!‚Äù A man yelled outside the door of Apartment 712. \n\nI admit the smoke detector should have woken me. It was blaring throughout the entirety of the seventh floor of the apartment complex. I had been lying on the couch either napping or daydreaming‚Ä¶ or perhaps in a state somewhere in between. \n\nThe alarm continued until my neighbor Will came barreling through the front door, quickly distinguishing the smoky, near fire at the oven by waving a dish towel vigorously at the billowing smoke. I remember him pulling out a burnt, ashy black disc. I don't really remember putting the frozen pizza in the oven, to be honest.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be more careful, Mr. Grant,‚Äù William said to me.\n\n‚ÄúAstute observation,‚Äù I remember uttering under my breath.\n\n\"What were you doing in here anyway?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI was cooking. And resting my eyes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou usually do that at the same time?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\n\n\"No one was hurt, that‚Äôs all that matters. How about you come over for dinner tonight? Corrine‚Äôs making a turkey,\" he finally said. \n\nHe was always unsuccessfully trying to get me to come over to their apartment. If he promised we would sit in silence and watch a movie with pizzas, I might have occasionally said yes.\n\n‚ÄúA generous offer, William. But I'm quite booked today.\"\n\n‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ Well, let me know if you need help with anything this weekend,\" he said.\n\nI gave William a subtle nod of feigned appreciation and showed him out. The thing about William is that he has always been an acquaintance trying to become a friend, perhaps no greater flaw in someone. I'm certainly too old now for new friends, and I was too old then as well.\n\nI will admit I did tape up a piece of paper on the front door, a makeshift sign that read: \n\n***Make Sure Oven is Off***\n\nMy retirement routine then was not too different than it is now.

        "text": "I‚Äôve suffered from severe night terrors and sleep paralysis for most of my life. It started when I was little and has continued to happen almost constantly into adulthood. For those of you who don‚Äôt know what sleep paralysis is, or have never experienced it, consider yourselves very lucky. To summarise the experience, your mind is awake but your body is still asleep. You wake up in the middle of the night, unable to move, and unable to scream. As this is happening, you begin to hallucinate terrible things, such as demons, witches, and whatever else your brain decides to torture you with. \n\nI‚Äôve always had one recurring creature visit me during my sleep paralysis episodes. It appears in a slightly different form every time I see it, but it always has glowing yellow eyes that resemble those of a cat. Its body is contorted and broken, and it crawls around like a spider. It has the upper body of a human, with long messy hair and large hands, but its legs are that of a goat. I always knew it was coming when I woke up, unable to move or speak, and heard the all too familiar sounds of its hooves thumping around, and its cracking bones. It contorted its body in all sorts of unnatural ways as it crawled up and down my walls and ceiling. Sometimes it would run up and down the hallway outside my room before crawling or sometimes running through my door. Every time I‚Äôve seen it, it has climbed on top of me and attempted to suck the life out of me. It begins by strangling me until I can no longer breathe, and whispers ‚Äúyou will be mine‚Äù. That horrible, evil, otherworldly voice has always been stuck in my head. I‚Äôve always just called it ‚ÄúThing Entity‚Äù because I had no other explanation as to what it was.\n\nOne of my foster parents would even come into my room, and begin beating me whenever I woke up screaming. I was constantly punished for my suffering. I would need to move into new foster homes quite frequently because of my nightly screaming.\n\nAs you can probably tell, going through this on an almost nightly basis really started to mess with my mental and physical health. Even when I turned 18 and left the foster care system, things didn‚Äôt get better. Sometimes I would go days without sleeping because I knew once I shut my eyes I would be in for a night of absolute terror. My grades at school suffered, my relationships suffered, and I could never hold down a job. I tried almost everything to cure it. Medications, meditation, therapy, and even hypnosis, but to no avail. Eventually, I got desperate and started looking into‚Ä¶ natural remedies.\n\nI knew a guy from high school named Oscar who sold marijuana and shrooms. I hit him up on Facebook and asked him if he was still selling. He said yes. I explained my situation to him and asked if he had anything that could help. He said he had the perfect product, and gave me a time and a date to meet up.\n\nWe met up at the local park at noon the next day. I saw him sitting on a bench. He saw me as well and waved me over. He changed quite a bit since high school. He was a lot skinnier than he used to be, with a large blond beard and long hair that went down to his waist. When I approached him at the bench, I tried to shake his hand, but he got up and hugged me instead. It was a little weird because we never really hung out that much in high school. The most notable encounter we had was when I had to drive him home from prom after he got kicked out for being intoxicated.\n\n‚ÄúAdrian! Long time no see, brother. So happy you reached out‚Äù he said enthusiastically.\n\n‚ÄúHappy to see you too, bro‚Äù I responded. ‚ÄúYou got the‚Ä¶ special product?‚Äù. He nodded and we both sat on the bench. \n\nHe reached into his backpack and took out some kind of tea bag. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI thought you were gonna give me shrooms or something or something to smoke.‚Äù\n\nHe went on to explain that the tea bag contained various mushrooms and herbs that would help me ‚Äúreach the upper plane‚Äù. I asked him what the hell he was talking about. All I wanted was something to help me sleep peacefully. He began giggling like a schoolgirl. At this point, I was losing my patience, so I got up to leave. But Oscar stopped me and begged for me to hear him out. I sat back down reluctantly.\n\nHe told me after he graduated high school, he travelled around the country to find himself. During his trip, he met the leader of a mysterious religious group who taught him how to make the special tea bag he had in his possession. The ingredients in the tea bag allowed the user to transfer their consciousness into ‚Äúthe upper plane‚Äù. \n\nHe went on to describe the upper plane as another dimension only accessible by human consciousness. To transfer one‚Äôs consciousness there, a person must completely detach themselves from this dimension with the help of years of meditation, or the content in the tea bag.\n\nI was extremely confused and I began laughing at what he was telling me. I was always a very skeptical, science-based person, so all of this sounded like complete nonsense to me. ‚ÄúSo how the hell is this gonna help with my problem?‚Äù I asked.\n\nHe leaned toward me like he was about to tell me a secret, and his tone changed and got much more serious. He started whispering. ‚ÄúOnce your consciousness is in the upper plane, you‚Äôll be able to remove any negativity weighing it down. Whatever you do there will have a direct impact on yourself here. Simply being there should do the trick because it will allow your mind to be cleansed and healed. Once you arrive, all you gotta do is sit there and enjoy the vibes. Time in the upper plane works differently than it does in this dimension, so you won‚Äôt be able to tell how long you‚Äôre in there, but you‚Äôll most likely reconnect with your body in around one or two Earth hours. After that, your sleep paralysis should be cured for good‚Äù. I was sitting there in disbelief and regret that I reached out to this wacko for help. But I was so desperate, I was willing to try anything. If modern medicine and therapy couldn‚Äôt help me, then maybe this was the miracle I needed.\n\n‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said reluctantly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try it‚Äù. Oscar smiled. He started handing over the tea bag but quickly pulled his hand back and got serious once again. \n\n‚ÄúAdrian, the upper plane appears differently to everyone who enters it, because our minds cannot fully comprehend its true form. There are a lot of things about it we don‚Äôt understand. Whatever world you find yourself in, do not wander around, stay in the place you arrive in the entire time. Do I make myself absolutely, 100% clear?‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúUmm, yeah man for sure‚Äù I responded.\n\n‚ÄúI wanna hear you say it‚Äù, he said.\n\nI exhaled in frustration. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I put my right hand over my heart and my left hand in the air in a joking manner.‚Äù I promise I won‚Äôt wander around the Narnia fantasy world or whatever it is‚Äù. \n\nHe grabbed my hand and put it back down. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mess around with this, it‚Äôs not a fantasy world, Adrian. Your actions in there have real consequences, do you understand?‚Äù. \n\n‚ÄúOkay, sorry,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI promise I won't wander‚Äù. He nodded, started smiling again, and handed me the tea bag. ‚ÄúLet it steep for 15 minutes, don‚Äôt add any sugar, milk or honey, and stir it well after you remove the tea bag. Finish the whole thing, then lay down in a safe spot‚Äù he explained. I asked how much I owed him but he told me helping out a friend was more than enough payment.\n\nThat night, after I finished dinner, I started boiling the water for the special tea. Once it was boiled, I followed all of Oscar‚Äôs instructions very carefully. I took the first sip, and it was absolutely revolting. I can only describe the taste as mud mixed with rotten eggs. It was too late to turn back at that point, so I plugged my nose during each sip and managed to gag the whole glass down in about 10 minutes. Once I finished, I went into my room, laid on my back and tried to take some deep breaths. My cat came in and curled up beside me. I waited about 15 minutes and felt absolutely nothing.\n\n‚ÄúOscar was full of crap‚Äù, I whispered as I shook my head. \n\nI started getting up, but then the room began spinning violently. I immediately laid back down and prepared for the wild trip ahead.\n\n‚ÄúHere we go‚Äù, I said to myself.\n\nThe world around me began to evaporate, almost like reality itself was breaking down. This continued until all I saw was pitch black. \n\nI began to feel myself fall. But I wasn't falling down. It felt like I was falling up.\n\nAll kinds of colours and lights began to appear until a galaxy started to form around me. I was afraid but also in awe of what I was witnessing. It felt like I was staring into eternity.\n\nAs I was falling, I saw a colourful planet appear in front of me. It got closer and closer until I realized I was hurdling right toward it.\n\nI closed my eyes and braced for impact as I approached the planet at exponential speed. Right before I was about to crash land, I slowed down and began floating slowly and safely toward the ground.\n\nI opened my eyes. What I saw and felt was absolutely indescribable from a human perspective, but I‚Äôll try my best.\n\nThe landscape was unlike anything I had ever seen before, both in real life and fiction. There were all kinds of vegetation and animals. They resembled the plants and animals on Earth, but they were so much more beautiful and complex. For example, I saw creatures that looked like lions, but they were red and green, with the legs of large birds and tails like peacocks. I saw multiple strange creatures floating in the sky. They all looked like combinations of different animals on Earth, some of them had multiple, human-looking eyes. They made loud but gorgeous singing noises that harmonized perfectly with each other.\n\nThe sky above was a perfect view of the galaxy, with different planets, stars, and colourful clouds littering the sky. Think of the most perfect night sky view you have ever seen, add the northern lights, then multiply that beauty by a million.\n\nI safely landed on the ground at the bottom of a massive waterfall that emptied into a crystal clear lake, filled with all kinds of unique and weird aquatic life.\n\nI felt absolute pure joy, like all my problems and negative feelings were left in the dark void I came through. This world didn‚Äôt feel like a dream, it felt so real, more real than my life back on Earth. I felt more aware, I could smell better, see better, hear better, and think clearer. It was total heavenly bliss. I could not believe what I was experiencing. I took a few minutes‚Ä¶ or hours, to take in my surroundings. Oscar was right, time worked differently in there, I had no perception of it. I spent an unknown amount of time sitting on a rock beside the waterfall, crying tears of joy. It was the first time I had felt happiness and peace in a very long time.\n\nI continued to look around the amazing world. I wanted to explore every corner of it. But then I remembered the stern warning Oscar gave me, absolutely no wandering. I shook off the feeling of curiosity, but then it came back. I just had to explore. ‚ÄúWhat does Oscar know?‚Äù I asked myself. ‚ÄúThis is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. If I don't explore, I'll regret it for the rest of my life‚Äù.\n\nI began walking down the shore of the lake. I heard a loud and majestic roar above me. I looked up and saw a group of whale-like creatures with wings, flying gracefully through the colourful sky. Eventually, I got to the entrance of a thick forest. I saw an adorable little woodland creature. It looked like some kind of squirrel mixed with a guinea pig, but it had blue fur and a pink tail. I tried to call it toward me but it ran into the woods. A child-like instinct took over, and I started laughing and chased after it. My movements in this world felt so fluid. I was running but it felt like I was floating.\n\nI was deep in the woods, still hot on the creature's tail when I saw a pure blue light coming from a cave in the distance. This immediately caught my attention and I stopped my pursuit. For some reason, I was drawn to it, almost hypnotically. I approached the cave and stopped at the entrance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had a visitor‚Äù, I heard from deep in the cave. \n\nI was shocked, I wasn‚Äôt expecting anyone else to be there. ‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù I shouted in response. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?!‚Äù. My voice echoed through the cave.\n\nThere was no answer. Then I began to hear footsteps coming from the cave. They got closer and closer, and the light got brighter and brighter. Eventually, a tall, bald, glowing man dressed in blue and yellow robes emerged from the cave. His eyes were strange, they didn‚Äôt have any corneas or pupils. They looked like galaxies, pitch black and dotted with bright stars.\n\n‚ÄúHello, Adrian‚Äù, he said. His voice was otherworldly. It echoed and slightly shook my chest and the ground around us as he spoke.\n\n‚ÄúHow do you know my name?‚Äù, I responded.\n\n‚ÄúI have known you your entire life, we‚Äôre closer than you think‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúAre‚Ä¶ are you God or something?‚Äù I asked.\n\nHe smiled and said, ‚ÄúIt depends on your definition of ‚ÄòGod‚Äô. What you see around you is my home. I have been trapped here since the beginning of creation. Outsiders don‚Äôt usually wander when they visit, so I have not met anyone else in a long time‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúTrapped? I would love to be trapped in a place like this. I was told not to wander before I got here, but I don‚Äôt know why. This place is wonderful‚Äù. \n\nThe man sat down on a rock beside the cave and smiled. ‚ÄúOutsiders are very closed minded‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúThey are afraid of what they will find here because they fear what they do not understand. But you are lucky you found me. I am the master of this realm. I can teach you all its secrets and you will be more knowledgeable and wise than anyone on Earth. How does that sound, Adrian?‚Äù. \n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a glowing yellow orb. ‚ÄúHere is your reward for finding me. I hold in my hand the secrets of existence. All you need to do is reach out and take it, and all the knowledge shall be yours.‚Äù\n\nI entered a trance, my eyes fixated on the glowing orb he was holding in front of me. I began to reach for it. \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right‚Äù, he said, almost menacingly. ‚ÄúThe knowledge of the cosmos shall soon be at your fingertips. You will be like a god to those on Earth‚Äù.\n\nI was almost touching the orb, but then I got an overwhelming sense that something was wrong. That was the first feeling of negativity I felt in that place.\n\nI quickly pulled my hand back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt‚Äù.\n\nThe man‚Äôs face quickly turned from friendly and benevolent, to sinister. He stood up and put the orb away.\n\n‚ÄúSo close-minded‚Äù, he snarled as his voice got deeper and more sinister. ‚ÄúNo problem. I‚Äôve always said you will be mine, one way or another. And now you are here, my boy. In my dwelling place‚Äù. \n\nHis eyes morphed into those all too familiar, yellow cat-like eyes. At that moment, I finally knew what this thing was. It wasn‚Äôt God or a friendly benevolent spirit. It was the same thing that had been tormenting me almost every night since I was a child. And now I had walked right into its home, into its trap.\n\nIt began morphing right in front of my eyes. Its body contorting, cracking and bending in all kinds of unnatural ways. It let out a horrible, blood-curdling scream that shook me to my core.\n\nAn overwhelming sense of fear and panic overtook me. I turned around and began running back in the direction I came from. I could still hear The Entity behind me, its hooves stomping the ground beneath it as it ran after me on all fours. The wonderful world I thought I was in began to change. The colour began disappearing, the beautiful creatures began hissing at me, and the sky above turned blood red. I began hearing screams of suffering coming from deep in the woods. Some of the voices were telling me to run, while others were demanding I join them.\n\nI looked behind me as I was running for my life, and saw The Entity quickly gaining on me. I had no idea what to do, or how to get out of there, so I started screaming for help. I don‚Äôt know who I was expecting to reach, but I had no other option.\n\nAs I was running and screaming, I noticed a door in the distance. I began running toward it, hoping it would lead me somewhere else. As I reached the door, The Entity grabbed me, sinking its claws into my leg with five of its fingers.\n\n‚ÄúYou cannot escape me, I am already with you! We are one!‚Äù, it yelled and laughed maniacally. In a last-ditch attempt to release myself from its grip, I began kicking it in the face over and over, releasing all the anger from the pain and suffering this thing had caused me my entire life. Finally, I kicked it hard enough that it released me. As soon as I was free, I opened the door, ran inside, and slammed it shut. Once I shut the door, I was back in the void. I felt myself falling down this time. until another universe formed around me. I saw another planet and recognized it right away, it was Earth.\n\nI began plummeting down toward Earth. Eventually, I found myself above my city, then my neighbourhood, then my house, and then I was hovering over my own body, still unconscious in my bed. I hovered above my body for a while until I slammed back into it. It felt like I hit concrete. I woke up gasping for air. I leaned over my bed toward my trash can and started throwing up.\n\nI noticed my cat walking into my room. I began calling her over, but as soon as she saw me she began hissing and ran away.\n\nOnce I composed myself, I grabbed my phone and checked the time. It was now 1:00 am. I had been out for 7 hours. I wondered why I was out for that long. Oscar said it would only last for one to two hours.\n\nI went to the bathroom and began splashing cold water on my face. I looked into the mirror and saw my eyes were bloodshot red, with deep bags underneath them.\n\n‚ÄúIt was just a dream, it was just a dream‚Äù I kept whispering to myself over and over. I splashed more water on my face, but when I looked back up at the mirror, I saw something horrible‚Ä¶. The Entity was standing right behind me, with its dirty claws on my shoulders. I turned around, but there was nothing there. I thought I was still high from the tea. I walked out of the bathroom back toward my bed, but then I began to feel a stinging pain on my leg. I stopped walking and rolled my pant leg up. I saw five large, bloody claw marks. As I was looking at my leg in disbelief, I thought about Oscar‚Äôs warning, ‚ÄúYour actions in there have real consequences‚Äù. I began to realize the gravity of the situation. That place I was in wasn‚Äôt just in my head, it was real. That Entity I had been seeing my entire life was real too, and I had just released it from whatever captivity had been holding it back.\n\n‚ÄúIt's real‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs real‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs real‚Äù, I kept repeating to myself. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do, so I curled up into a ball and began to cry.\n\nAs I laid on the floor sobbing, I heard my cat scream, followed by a sharp crunching sound. I got up quickly. ‚ÄúLayla!‚Äù I shouted, but she didn‚Äôt come. I walked around my apartment trying to find her. I started getting a feeling that something terrible had happened. When I got to the living room‚Ä¶ My heart dropped. Layla was on the couch, decapitated. Her blood was everywhere. On the wall beside the couch, written in her blood were the words ‚ÄúWe are one‚Äù. In the mirror above my couch, I saw it. It was where my reflection should have been. I walked closer to the mirror and it followed.\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you want!?‚Äù, I screamed. ‚ÄúWhat the hell do you want?!‚Äù\n\nThe Entity began smiling at me, showing its sharp, dirty fangs. Those yellow eyes that had haunted me for all those years, were staring right back at me.\n\n‚ÄúYou have already given me what I wanted, Adrian. Thank you for freeing me‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúI was waiting so long for you to come get me, I was so lonely in there. Now you and I can finally be one.‚Äù It began laughing.\n\nI started punching the mirror. Blood began pouring down my arms as shards of glass dug deep into my knuckles.\n\n‚ÄúLeave me alone! Leave me alone!‚Äù I screamed.\n\nI began to feel my feet lift off the ground. I flew into the wall violently. As I was laying on the floor, The Entity emerged from the shattered mirror, its body contorting as it got closer to me. As it stood above me, I blacked out.\n\nI woke up in an alleyway the next morning. I pulled out my phone and called Oscar.\n\n‚ÄúAdrian! What‚Äôs up brother? How was your journey?‚Äù.\n\nI stayed silent, breathing heavily and not knowing what to say.\n\n‚ÄúAdrian‚Ä¶‚Äù his tone became serious. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt wander, did you?‚Äù.\n\nI began sobbing. ‚ÄúI fucked up, man. I‚Äôm so, so sorry. Something‚Ä¶ Something followed me out of there. Something that has been tormenting me since I was a child. It‚Äôs real, It‚Äôs after me‚Ä¶ I need your help, please‚Äù.\n\nOscar was silent and didn‚Äôt say a word. I could hear him breathing heavily. His breath was trembling like he was panicking. \n\n‚ÄúOscar, please help me, please tell me what to do!‚Äù, I yelled in complete desperation.\n\n‚ÄúThat thing you released is more dangerous than you could possibly imagine. That is why I told you not to wander! When you disobeyed my warning, you gave this thing a route into our world. When you returned, It hitched a ride on you. It used to be trapped in there, and it could only astral project itself into your night terrors. But now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs here, and there is no limit to the harm it can cause you and others‚Äù.\n\nI began panicking. ‚ÄúPlease.. Please tell me how to get rid of it. I‚Äôm begging you‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard stories about those who have wandered in the upper plane. Once they return, they begin to lose their minds, until they lose themselves and something completely different takes over. There is no way to get rid of it, Adrian. It‚Äôs already here, in our world. You are its vessel into this world and as long as you‚Äôre here, it will stay. I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I shouldn‚Äôt have given you the tea. I just wanted to help you, but you didn‚Äôt listen to my warnings. You were never ready‚Äù.\n\nI became furious. I started punching the garbage bin in the alley. ‚ÄúNo! No! No! You fix this shit right now! I‚Äôm not gonna let this thing take me!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, there‚Äôs nothing I can do. Goodbye, Adrian‚Äù. Then he hung up. After he hung up, I heard The Entity on the phone, laughing maniacally. I smashed my phone on the ground and ran away.\n\nI am losing my sanity. Every day, The Entity grows stronger and stronger, and I lose more and more control of myself. I don‚Äôt know how long I have left, but I‚Äôll continue fighting this thing as long as I can. If I lose the battle, this post will stand as a testament to the fact that I fought like hell to overcome this thing. Throughout my entire life, the only person I could ever rely on was myself, and I will continue to fight for myself.",

        "text": "Preface: a note on rules.\n\nIn hindsight, we convince ourselves that we should have known from the first shred of dissonance, but humanity is ever capable of holding onto perceptions as reality. We find meaning, see supporting evidence, and take those ideas which we fail to disprove as the indomitable truth. Hypotheses are made to be disproven. We create ideas and then endeavor to destroy them. To prove is unreachable, but to disprove is the lifeblood understanding. So please, believe me when I tell you, I‚Äôve failed to disprove this idea in many bloody and tortuous ways. We‚Äôve sacrificed life, limb, sanity, and hope, and still, the theory holds water. Morosity is not my intention; it is the inevitable conclusion from our trials. This is the theory of how we end.\n\nTruths we (think we) know (now):\n\n1. Appearances deceive\n   1. Do not trust your eyes\n   2. Do not trust their faces\n2. Use a password\n   1. Redundancy breeds robust systems\n   2. Do not trust single shreds of evidence. Believe bodies, sometimes literally.\n   3. 2 redundancies are good. Three is better. Four is overkill.¬†\n3. Us the buddy system\n   1. Unless you‚Äôre a survival jack of all trades, safety is most easily achieved in groups\n   2. *Never separate* \\- always go in pairs. If your buddy is missing, they‚Äôre not your buddy anymore until redundancy proves otherwise (or until the redundant buddy/body proves it)\n\nA disclaimer - this is not a guide in the traditional sense. This is what‚Äôs left of my sanity bundled in sentences and organized into some semblance of logic and order - control falsified by text.¬† I‚Äôve long since abandoned my attempt to impose gridlines onto the chaos that reigns outside. Please, take these words, as all things, with a grain of salt and impose upon them your own evidence.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure what the first clue was. I remember the early days before the illusion shattered, when the sense of wrongness was a constant, unnoticed hum in the background. It may have been the eye contact, or the number of times they say your name. The threads of our reality frayed and we saw the hasty repairs done with fibers not quite matching our own. But, uncomfortable, we looked away, determined to see only those details matching our memory of the tapestry. I don‚Äôt know when the unwinding became impossible to glance over, but I do know when I began to perceive it.¬†\n\nShe came back with scissors. It was the end of summer and it was dusk. We‚Äôd been waiting, indolent and unbothered, for the air to cool from the day and had set up the camping chairs so we could sit any place other than the ground, still damp from the evening‚Äôs storm. Two of us were still working on our grad degrees, so we‚Äôd invite Murphy and Sam and Rayna to the park to drink and eat burned meat from the park grills by campus. Others wandered the lakefront nearby. Ava had gone with Mark to grab more beer and some plates because we always forget them from the corner store on Main, just a few blocks from the park. She came back alone.\n\nSam had been saying something depressing - probably about toxic academics in ivory towers or something we all nodded along to - and Ava had come strolling back to the circle. I‚Äôd asked her where Mark was, and she‚Äôd looked at me in the eyes and said ‚Äòhe‚Äôll be back soon, Alexis‚Äô and I‚Äôd started laughing because she called me Alexis and I haven‚Äôt been called Alexis since my mom saw me last winter. She‚Äôd just smiled, still holding eye contact. Back in those days, they were fresher, less assimilated. Now the eye contact is less common and less of an immediate giveaway. I‚Äôd felt that first hit of disillusion, like reality clicked ever so slightly out of place, and I saw her holding the scissors casually in her fisted hand. I‚Äôd wonder later if they already had a smear of red, but memory is fallible. I can never be sure. She was still smiling and staring at me, unblinking, and Murphy had looked at her laughing at some shit Sam had said when she raised her hand and brought it down, scissors held firm, on Murphy‚Äôs head.¬†\n\nReality shattered and chaos slipped into its place.\n\nIt took a few seconds to process. Sam and Rayna didn‚Äôt react at first; they hadn‚Äôt been looking. Sam looked when Murphy started slumping, with Ava still holding the scissors angled down in his temple. He hadn‚Äôt said anything - I always thought you‚Äôd have a second if something happened, but I don‚Äôt even know if he had enough time to feel the blow. The scissors slipped a bit out. I thought it was a joke for a moment. There was blood now, rolling down his cheek. Ava was still looking at me smiling with her teeth and dimples. Sam faltered, her fading laughter turning to confusion and alarm as Murphy slipped over his seat further, until finally the scissors slid all the way out, still in Ava‚Äôs grasp. That was when the yelling started. I hear later that Rayna was the one shouting. Sam didn‚Äôt scream, just stood up and stumbled backwards away from Murphy as he fell towards her shoes. I remember Ava holding the scissors, coated in blood now, smiling as she took a gentle step over Murphy‚Äôs sneakers and towards me. I ran. I still run sometimes when shit gets critical, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever run as fast as I did then.¬†\n\nIt was a case that closed before it opened. Multiple witnesses and all. Ava left after she stabbed Murphy. She went back to the corner of 8th and Forest Ave and disappeared into the corner store bathroom. They found her there later, scissors in her throat, bled out on the floor. I was surprised later that the case was open and shut so quickly, but I guess their time of death calculation isn‚Äôt that precise. After all, what would they have thought when it came out that she‚Äôd died before Murphy?\n\nThe news was lightning on a clear day. A perfectly normal and unremarkable, at least criminally, woman in her mid twenties brutally murders a friend on a balmy August evening during a perfectly normal and unremarkable cook-out. The story ran, both in headlines and in rumor circles, some whispered as judgements, others discussed in somber tones as the result of some psychotic break. Bring in more mental healthcare. Make sure our students are getting treatment if they need it. Anxiety and depression in higher education is A Problem, etc. Nothing really changed fundamentally, per usual. The thing about lightning is thunder always follows, and it did. Two weeks later, a multiple homicide a couple towns over. No survivors, family annihilator-style, only without the trademark escape. He must have been under immense pressure. No one saw it coming. The poor wife. The poor children. What must he have been thinking? His body was found by the door to the master bathroom, with his wife feet away in bed. Some people wondered how he managed to kill himself with a mallet. Other people explained, with their lack of medical and criminal education, that he must have felt shame at his crimes and been unable to bear it. He‚Äôd punished himself. How does one punish oneself to death with a mallet? Especially from that angle, but it‚Äôd been irrefutable. The video feed from the nursery showed him killing at least the youngest. He must have killed his wife, then the kids, then himself. Again, open and closed. A handful of days later, stockroom employee kills coworkers with a forklift (all caught on video) and is found dead, later, from a crush injury in a back corner. A line cook skewers 3 customers with a paring knife through the eyes then disappears into a bathroom. Someone comes out 30 seconds later, screaming that some guy just gutted himself in the stall next to theirs.¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre beginning to see a pattern here I hope. If not, it‚Äôs probably already too late for you. Your brain is pattern seeking - use that here and now, or you‚Äôll never make it. Then again, maybe that‚Äôs for the best considering I doubt any of us will.¬†\n\nThe pattern:¬†\n\n(i) Normal and unremarkable person A inflicts horrifying and lethal damage on person(s) B - ??¬†\n\n(ii) Normal and unremarkable person turns on themselves and is found dead\n\n(iii) Some irrefutable, usually visual, evidence of their crime is found and they‚Äôre posthumously convicted by the jury of public opinion (and the cops) of being guilty of the heinous crime\n\n(iv) (This is key) their death is not caught on camera\n\nI‚Äôm willing to bet you either believe me, or someone has run the most effective misinformation campaign of all time. If the latter has happened, I‚Äôd pay careful attention to your figures of authority. How much eye contact do they make? Do you ever feel like a mouse in a laboratory cage? Do you ever wonder what bits of your body will end up on slides? To be fair, this analogy runs a bit thin - I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre studying us or just killing, but hey, I‚Äôm a scientist at heart, and I‚Äôm giving them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOn to the lessons.\n\n1. **Appearances deceive**\n\nIf you‚Äôre like me, dear reader, then you‚Äôve likely relied on visual evidence. The meat is cooked because it‚Äôs no longer pink. Spring is here because the trees are growing leaves. The plane is in the air because you see clouds all around you. You see, you notice, and you believe. Unfortunately, we now know visual evidence, however direct and convincing, is refutable. For example, I see my uncle strangle my cousin using laundry cord. In the before times, I‚Äôd think ‚Äòwell, uncle Brett always was kind of an asshole, so this, though shocking and traumatizing, will later be re-written as something we should have seen coming.‚Äô If I saw it today, I‚Äôd know (1) that‚Äôs not uncle Brett, and (2) if we‚Äôre lucky, uncle Brett is somewhere nearby, still breathing and not about to stop in the immediate future. The eyes fool - Uncle Brett 2.0 is illusory, but unfortunately tangible and visually convincing.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm still not sure what the illusion is. I thought at first it was a projection, some kind of glamour or some such mythical nonsense. Evidence against this: you can touch them, hurt them, disfigure them, and damage them. You can kill them. They‚Äôre solid enough, which, depressingly, is a tally in the positives category. I now think, after some refinement, that they can shift or wear disguises, but that the costumes are flesh and blood. They become perfect likenesses, right down the bones that will break if enough force is exerted. To be direct, the closest word I can use is doppelganger, though even that descriptor is not perfect.¬†\n\nTraditional doppels, in the mythical sense, do act similarly. They do seek out the original and attempt to kill them to replace them more easily. They attempt to imitate the original, though most of them just imitate what they think the average person would do. You‚Äôll notice, rarely will they say much of anything. Would you, in their shoes? They enter the image, the copy, and they infiltrate, but they‚Äôre not perfect copies in any ways other than visually. They have the mole on your ass, but not your childhood trauma.¬†\n\nNext lesson.¬†\n\n1. **Use a password**\n\nLike I said before, the doppels (yes I‚Äôm calling them doppels, if you have a better idea, I do not care. Bigger fish.) have either no knowledge, or severely limited knowledge of their originals. They might know they have a family based on framed photos, or they might know their dog‚Äôs name from their collar tag, but they won‚Äôt know that the Klines are coming over for dinner on Tuesday so they need to pick up wine that afternoon. To be fair, most of their goals tend to be immediate and violent, so it usually doesn‚Äôt matter, but it does present an opportunity. Passwords protect.\n\nOne of the first lessons they learned was that waiting to act can lead to better return on their investment. If they hang around a while, they can access more information and more people, all the better to kill them and infiltrate to kill others more easily. To find them out, every single person in your group will need a password. Unfortunately, a single password or a simple system is easy to crack. Though they don‚Äôt generally speak much, they can and are able to say passwords among other things if they happen to overhear them. Use a password. Another useful system is redundancy: implement multiple layers of checks. (1) a verbal password, (2) a password rule, and (3) a visual cue. Most infiltration attempts have been caught by the three layers. We‚Äôve tried to add a fourth layer in the past, but there‚Äôs always one or two people who can‚Äôt track all four consistently enough for it to be useful and reliable. Someone forgets one layer or gets it wrong and we accidentally almost kill an original.¬†\n\nTo be more specific, each person in a group (more on group size later) should have an identifier word or phrase. You can make your own as long as it‚Äôs memorable. The group should have some non-obvious rule, like the third word must always contain the letter p or some reference to a Beatles song. Lastly, each person should have some subtle physical talisman, not for mystical purposes, but for identification. The doppels are excellent at recreating the physical details of the body, but they usually miss subtle details like jewelry or personal belongings. If you dress in a red sweater and jeans and carry a flat stone in your right pocket, they‚Äôll dress in a red sweater and jeans, but the stone will be missing. Important to this rule: the talisman cannot be obvious. Obvious talismans defeat the purpose, but hey, have fun with it. I knew a guy who had a tamagotchi that was his verbal password and talisman - always wondered if the doppels would know how to take care of a tamagotchi or understand that the point of it in the first place.¬†\n\nFinally, the finishing touch:¬†\n\n1. **Use the buddy system**\n\nSure it‚Äôs higher stakes than going to the bathroom, but the buddy system nevertheless maintains its utility. To be fair, this is the most obvious strategy, and it‚Äôs one the doppels have begun to routinely anticipate, but having a buddy at least means there‚Äôs a higher chance of (i) both of you surviving, (ii) one of you surviving and warning the others, or (iii) if neither of you lives, changes are one of the doppels will fuck up and give themselves away faster when there are two of them than one of them. It‚Äôs also just more difficult for them to get the drop on someone of they‚Äôve got a buddy watching their back. Granted, if you can travel in larger groups, it‚Äôs good to take more people. Doppels generally aren‚Äôt traveling in packs as far as I can tell, so there is a physical limit to the number of people they can replace. I‚Äôve seen groups as large as 4 be entirely taken out and replaced, but it‚Äôs rare. It‚Äôs almost always one or two replacements, and most often just one.¬†\n\nLastly, group size protection has its limits. Because we are potentially (really likely) living through an apocalypse of sorts, knowing the person who has your back is imperative. You can trust a stranger in emergencies, but keeping your group sizes to a manageable level is important. For one, having too many people means you don‚Äôt notice a strange face, and then you‚Äôre wrestling a doppler when you turn a corner trying not to get replaced. You also need to be able to remember everyone‚Äôs identifiers. I‚Äôve never seen it personally, but I‚Äôve heard stories of actual people being killed because everyone was convinced something was off. People can be stupid in desperation, but it doesn‚Äôt help the person who was killed for acting slightly differently than expected. Again, way way more common in groups that don‚Äôt use redundancy, but you can‚Äôt help everyone.¬†\n\nAs it stands, we have our group, we have our system, and we have at least a semblance of normalcy, though that too is fast fading. We know that the doppels are gaining ground - news reports have dwindled, even though word of mouth says the killings are continuing. We also know that at least a few doppels are in positions of power, but it‚Äôs unclear why. The higher up doppels don‚Äôt follow the same rules. Unless they‚Äôve already replaced all of those in power, they don‚Äôt seem to be taking the same unmeasured violence approach they had in the early days. That means they‚Äôre strategizing, which, as you may have surmised, is concerning. If we can figure out why, maybe we can turn the tide and gain back something resembling an upper hand, but at this point I‚Äôm betting on impending demise. Bottoms up, friends, as long as you have a lockable room and a camera recording every corner.",

        "text": "[You're probably going to want to read the first part, because...](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10yz6bd/how_to_cure_your_phobia/)\n\n  \nAfter being thrown into the trunk of the car, my mind went blank for a while.¬†  \n\n\nThat‚Äôs the thing about anti-anxiety medications. You take your pill, and you can calm down enough to close the shades in your apartment. Your raging boyfriend slips a handful of 'em into your juice, however, and you‚Äôll end up semi-conscious in an unknown location.¬†  \n\n\nRelatable, am I right?  \n\n\nI only have a couple flashes of memory of the next few hours, but I‚Äôve tried to put the pieces together of what happened.¬†  \n\n\nFeeling my body rolling uncomfortably back and forth. *The stopping and starting motion of Lucas driving, throwing me around in the trunk.*  \n\n\nForcing open my heavy eyes for just a moment and seeing stunning oranges and pinks. *A beautifully inopportune sunset in the distance as Lucas carried my limp form.*  \n\n\nThen, the smell of earth. The sensation of being lowered. And just as the medication was starting to wear off, an odd buzzing noise I couldn‚Äôt place.  \n\n\nI came to with slow realizations. At first, a¬†vague, intuitive anxiety that I couldn't yet place. Then, a pulsing ache in my head. A sting in my parched throat as I inhaled. The uncomfortable sensation of lying on something rock hard.¬†  \n\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until I opened my eyes that I realized I was in a living nightmare.¬†  \n\n\nAll around me were thick wooden walls. They spanned just to the edge of my shoulders, the tip of my toes and top of my head, leaving little room for movement. My face was mere inches from the cover.¬†  \n\n\nI was in a casket.¬†  \n\n\nThe medication‚Äôs aftereffects delayed my reaction just enough to steal the impending scream of horror out of my throat, keeping me frozen in appalled terror.¬†  \n\n\n*This isn‚Äôt real. This can‚Äôt be real.*  \n\n\nBut deep in my gut, something told me this was nothing but reality. I had been drugged and locked in a box.¬†  \n\n\nThere was a horrible scraping noise and then a¬†*smack*, as something shook my disturbing cell. My mind still foggy, it took me a moment to recognize what it was.¬†  \n\n\nLucas‚Äô grunt of exertion. And then the sound of earth being shoveled on top of the wooden coffin.¬†  \n\n\n*He was going to bury me alive.*  \n\n\nIt was this thought that awakened my nervous system, sending me from vague anxiety into full fight or flight.¬†  \n\n\nI let out a bloodcurdling scream that echoed through my torture chamber, sounding as though it was coming it me from all sides, pressing down on my eardrums and piercing the darkness of my cell.  \n\n\n‚ÄúPLEASE, I CANT BREATHE!‚Äù  \n\n\nThe shoveling stopped for a moment, and I heard Lucas‚Äô familiar voice. It was colder than I had ever imagined it could be - my sunshine of a boyfriend was fully eclipsed.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúYou made me do this. You could have just *listened*¬†\\- but you‚Äôre just too selfish. Too weak. If you aren‚Äôt willing to be better, not even for *me*, after *everything* I did for you‚Ä¶ then maybe you‚Äôll have to face your fears the hard way.‚Äù  \n\n\nHe continued shoveling, unbothered by my shrieks of terror. Loud pounds ensued, rocks and dirt falling heavy onto the casket I lay imprisoned by.¬†  \n\n\nClaustrophobia took over my mind, holding no place for logic. My screams were constant, unending, my brain devoid of any thought besides total, primal panic. My entire body was numb, ears full of a high ringing noise. I felt the familiar frightened belief that the walls were pressing tight around me.¬†  \n\n\nExcept this time, they really were.¬†  \n\n\nMy vision began to tunnel and then widen over and over, my abdomen rising and falling rapidly. The terror made my brain want to shut down, surrender to unconsciousness, but some small instinct refused to let me have an escape from a life threatening situation. The racing of my heart, the sharp stabbing feeling in my chest - I knew from experience it had to be anxiety, but the intensity could have convinced me it was cardiac arrest.  \n\n\nI couldn‚Äôt breathe - was it my panic attack or a lack of air? After all, there was only a finite amount of oxygen in such a small space. Endless increments of time were passing. Seconds? Minutes? Years? In my delirious, reeling brain, there was no keeping track.¬†  \n\n\nPanicking in my shaded living room seemed silly now - a space with endless air, room to move. What a luxury! How had that frightened me, compared to the hell I was held captive in now? A lifetime of being pointlessly afraid in safe places had led me straight to a death worse than I ever could have foreseen.¬†  \n\n\nI felt a rush of sorrow for myself and all the things I‚Äôd missed out on by running from my phobia. There were so many ways that my life had been ruled by fear. And now my death, as well. I felt a tear drip down the side of my temple, dropping peacefully into my hair. I knew adrenaline could only go at full blast for so long - I was beginning to sink into a defeated exhaustion.¬†  \n\n\nThe shovelfuls of soil being piled on my casket weren‚Äôt loud crashing sounds anymore. Each dump sounded slightly more distant, like there was a thick layer of earth between myself and the rest of humanity. How much more dirt did Lucas have left to drown me in?  \n\n\nSlowly, afraid of triggering another wave of panic, I reached up a hand and touched the ceiling of the box. An intrusive memory of Lucas‚Äô grounding exercise, *four things you can feel*, floated through my anxious mind. I ran my hand along the rough seams. As expected, they were solid and unyielding. My boyfriend was an engineer, after all. He could have been working on this since long before we ever met.  \n\n\nMaybe he‚Äôd even done this before.  \n\n\nAn unexpectedly furious feeling of betrayal cut through my sorrow like a knife, sparking electricity into my numb body. I‚Äôd trusted him. I‚Äôd let him into my mind, my worst fears. And now, he would use them to murder me.¬†  \n\n\nI could not let that happen.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúLucas?‚Äù I tried hesitantly. With my nervous system no longer in control, speaking was agonizing - my vocal cords shredded from the previous screams. It was too quiet, there was no change in his shoveling.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúLucas!‚Äù I shouted, wincing. It came out just loud enough that I hoped it would reach him.¬†  \n\n\nThe shoveling stopped for a moment. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  \n\n\nHe sounded like he‚Äôd responded on reflex. I could almost see those gorgeous blue eyes widening with surprise - after all, I‚Äôd stopped screaming, and I didn‚Äôt sound panicked anymore.¬†  \n\n\nI deliberated for a moment. I‚Äôd only have one chance at this. I needed to say it right, or it was all over.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúThank you. I needed this.‚Äù  \n\n\nProbably ten seconds of quiet. I lay still, waiting. Even through feet of soil, I could sense his confusion.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He repeated, sounding suspicious.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúI needed this. You were right, I needed to face my fears the hard way. I should have pushed myself more. Because I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not afraid anymore.‚Äù  \n\n\nAnother long silence.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúYou did everything for me,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúYou were enough to fix my phobia. Thank you, baby.‚Äù  \n\n\nI imagined his sharp intake of breath, mouth falling open with wonder at his own perceived success. And then there was a different noise. Like the shoveling from before, but without the heavy drop above me.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming, Janie!‚Äù  \n\n\nAfraid to believe him, I stayed unmoving, staring in trepidation at the cover of the casket. I could hear the shovel, moving more quickly now, sinking into the dirt above me. It sounded louder, closer to me. With each scoop of earth, Lucas‚Äô grunts of exertion became more clear.  \n\n\n*Please let me get out of this. Please let me live.*  \n\n\nI wasn‚Äôt sure if my pleas were for God, Lucas, or myself.¬†  \n\n\nThere was a loud buzz on the wood above me, removing thick screws, and I cringed at the noise. My heart was racing again, but with a new fear this time.¬†  \n\n\nWith a creak, I heard the lid of the box being pulled away. Suddenly, I was blinded by light, and covered my eyes.¬†  \n\n\nLucas moved his flashlight away from my face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really not afraid anymore?‚Äù  \n\n\nBlinking away the spots in my vision, I looked up at my boyfriend. Plastered on a dazzling smile. ‚ÄúYou saved me.‚Äù  \n\n\nHe grinned widely, teeth reflecting the flashlight‚Äôs glow. Lucas extended a hand and hauled me up onto the grass. It was nighttime now, and we were in a small clearing surrounded by trees. I glanced back down, towards the casket, trying to suppress my shiver. The box I‚Äôd been locked in was nestled into a deep hole, just big enough for a person.  \n\n\nLucas pulled me in for a tight hug, and I tried not to flinch away. ‚ÄúI love you, Jane.‚Äù  \n\n\nWrapping my reluctant arms around him, I murmured in a croaking voice, ‚ÄúI love you too, Lucas.‚Äù  \n\n\nHe looked back at the dark hole. It looked empty and sinister. The homemade wooden casket at the bottom lay open, as if in waiting. Lucas sighed as though he was bored. ‚ÄúI should close this thing back up before we go home. I mean, it‚Äôs just off the highway, we don‚Äôt want anyone to see and be suspicious.‚Äù  \n\n\nHe laughed smugly, his voice unfeeling, inhuman. An electric shock of rage pulsed through me again.¬†  \n\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go back to your place this time,‚Äù I promised.¬†  \n\n\nLucas squeezed my hand, beaming. And he leaned far into the earth to drill the box back together.¬†  \n\n\nHe didn‚Äôt even see the shovel aiming for the back of his head.¬†\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...  \n\n\nYou know, it was a tight fit, seeing as the casket was made for someone smaller, but I think Lucas looked far better in it than I did. He really was an angelic looking man.¬†  \n\n\nOr, maybe he still is one. I never did figure out how much oxygen there is in that small of a space.¬†  \n\n\nBut it‚Äôs weird. When I shoveled the last bit of dirt on top of the mound, faintly hearing desperate pleas from far below my feet, I was hit with a sudden realization. One that was made even clearer when I went home, pulled all the blinds down in my bedroom and peacefully crawled into bed. One that has stayed clearly in my mind, a whole year after the ordeal.¬†  \n\n\nI realized I should be thanking my old boyfriend. I mean, even if it was the opposite of his plan, the way things went down seemed to be pretty good for me.¬†  \n\n\nAfter all, I‚Äôm not so claustrophobic anymore.¬†",

        "text": "After [fleeing from Griffin's Edge](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10so2iy/burning_sky_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality_part_11/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I found myself standing with Milo and Asher somewhere in the middle of the dark forests. One of them looked distinctly more excited about our new location than the other. I‚Äôll let you guess which one.\n\nWe all just kind of stood there for a minute, still processing the shock and panic of what had just happened. I didn‚Äôt even realize that I was still holding Asher‚Äôs hand, or that his other gloved hand was gripping Milo‚Äôs tightly, until he noticed and quickly tugged them away.\n\nMilo was the first to speak. ‚ÄúHas it gotten brighter since I was last here? Love what you‚Äôve done with the place.‚Äù\n\nAsher sighed, a long, exasperated sigh that reminded me of Henri. ‚ÄúLook, I didn‚Äôt know where else to go. You heard the fire-eyed lady trying to kill me. I‚Äôm not *allowed* anywhere else. Sorry if it‚Äôs not exactly a five-star hotel.‚Äù\n\nMilo laughed. ‚ÄúWho needs a five-star hotel when you‚Äôve got gnarled trees and carnivorous beasts?‚Äù\n\nAsher narrowed his eyes at Milo, as if trying to decide whether he was being made fun of. Evidently, he determined that Milo was just being, well, Milo. He cracked a smile. ‚ÄúExactly my thoughts.‚Äù\n\nWe lulled into silence again, broken only by the whispers of the wind and growls of monsters from the undergrowth. Despite the efforts to joke, I could feel the tension like a wall of bricks around us. All I could think about was Uncle Henri vanishing behind hungry flames, left fighting Sky in a blur of lilac smoke and screams. I couldn‚Äôt shake my worry about him. Sky was just as powerful and ancient as Henri. What if he didn‚Äôt win? What if I never saw him again?\n\n‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I finally said. ‚ÄúWe should probably get somewhere safer.‚Äù\n\nBoth of them turned to look at me, concern written across their faces. ‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶okay?‚Äù asked Milo softly.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried about your uncle,‚Äù said Asher. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHenri will be fine,‚Äù Milo said pointedly, nudging Asher. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the toughest being I‚Äôve ever met. If anyone can get out of that hurricane without a scratch, it‚Äôs him.‚Äù\n\nI nodded, swallowing around the lump in my throat with a great deal of effort. I knew they were trying to help. It was nice. But somehow talking about it was making me feel even worse, and now I was only thinking about it more.\n\nPlus, Milo and Asher were both watching me with concern, and I wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt about that either. Never thought I‚Äôd say this, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I preferred it when they looked at me in annoyance after I did something stupid. At least it was better than pity.\n\nMilo opened his mouth to say something else, but he didn‚Äôt get the chance. In classic dark forest fashion, the ever-present growl exploded into a cacophony of roars, and I barely had time to react with ‚ÄúOH SH-‚Äù before a saber-tooth tiger-like monster with massive quills instead of fur burst from the bushes.\n\nI cursed under my breath as I pulled Sgrios from my belt. I remembered this monster. I‚Äôd encountered it before, fairly recently; Milo had sung it‚Äîand me‚Äîto sleep. In fact, based on the anticipation in its molten gold eyes, I suspected it was the very same tiger we‚Äôd met then. And it was excited for a second chance at lunch.\n\nInstinctively, Milo, Asher, and I moved in closer. Without taking his eyes off the stalking monster, Asher slowly reached down and pulled a thin silver dagger from his boot. I glanced at him in disbelief. ‚ÄúYou keep a *dagger* in your *shoe*?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThree, actually,‚Äù said Asher, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt even need them if I had my flamethrower, but I didn‚Äôt bring it with me in our haste to step off a human building when we left Oasis.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUncalled for,‚Äù I complained.\n\n‚ÄúGuys,‚Äù said Milo nervously, ‚ÄúHe looks like he‚Äôd love seafood.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe liked your lullaby last time,‚Äù I said, still holding my knife out in front of me, hoping it would scare the tiger. It did not seem to be working, though the beast hadn‚Äôt attacked yet; it continued to circle us, growling softly, its golden stare intense and hungry.\n\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù said Milo, ‚Äúbut *you* didn‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt think I could keep it up long enough to drag you *both* out of here.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt panic,‚Äù Asher said softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve dealt with these tigers plenty. Flamethrower would help, but we‚Äôll be fine. There‚Äôs three of us and only one of it.‚Äù\n\nIn true dark forest fashion *again,* the forest apparently took his words as a challenge, because they‚Äôd barely left his mouth when the growls in the trees escalated to a crescendo. I looked to my left, then to my right‚ÄîI could have sworn the noise had increased from *both* sides. But surely I must be imagining things‚Äî\n\nNo. I wasn‚Äôt. A second later, the bushes trembled on each side of the small clearing we stood in, and nearly simultaneously, *two* more of the tiger-like monsters stalked out of the undergrowth. We were now surrounded.\n\n‚ÄúYou were *saying*?‚Äù Milo whispered. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy for him that he has friends,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just wish they weren‚Äôt even hungrier than he is.‚Äù\n\nAsher rolled his eyes so hard that I sensed his exasperation without even turning my head. ‚ÄúBoth of you, shut up,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúThis just got a whole lot harder. I wonder if I could travel with two of you‚Ä¶?‚Äù\n\nWithout even a conscious decision, we had rotated so that we all stood back-to-back, preventing any blind spots. The tigers *were* apparently friends, or at least willing to work together to get a meal, because they too had begun to circle us in sync slowly, snapping their jaws and keeping up a constant low growl.\n\nStill, I immediately shook my head at Asher‚Äôs thought. ‚ÄúOh, hell no,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather let the tigers tear me apart than let you drag me through the shadows again.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, you just might get that chance,‚Äù retorted Asher.\n\nI guess the tigers agreed, because they chose that moment to attack. \n\nAsher, Milo, and I all cursed simultaneously as we scattered to avoid their claws and quills. I swung Sgrios at the closest tiger as it lunged past, getting in only a glancing blow. Backing up to edge myself against a gnarled tree, I let it turn and advance, then jabbed forward, aiming for its face. It roared and managed to sink a fang into my forearm. \n\nGroaning, I twisted against its tooth, reaching with my free hand into my pocket for my lighter. Some kind of green-black smoke was emitting from the spot where its fang broke my skin; I was already feeling light-headed. I cursed mentally. Quite possibly its fangs were tipped with venom, which wouldn‚Äôt be fun to deal with in the next few minutes.\n\nI pulled out the lighter and flicked it on. Luckily, Henri had finally gotten me an upgrade: a phoenix-made lighter. While not quite as extravagant as a dragon‚Äôs style, anything crafted by phoenixes is a force to be reckoned with. A massive ball of fire rolled outwards from the lighter, singeing my fingertips as it collided with the tiger‚Äôs chest. \n\nI covered my face with my arms, flinching back against the tree as the monster roared and fell backwards, flailing, going up in flames. The phoenix fireball burned it to ash unnaturally fast; I had barely clicked the lighter shut by the time the tiger that had just been attacking me collapsed to the ground, nothing but a pile of venom-tipped quills and smoldering embers.\n\nI straightened up against the trunk of the tree, wincing as I looked down at the jagged hole in my jacket sleeve, beneath which my wound was black and green around the edges. The roots seemed to sway slightly beneath my feet. I took a deep breath to steady myself. Its fangs had *definitely* been venomous. \n\nI‚Äôd have to worry about that in a minute. For now, I pushed myself off the tree, still wielding my lighter in one hand and Sgrios in the other. For the first time since the monsters had attacked, I caught a glimpse of how Milo and Asher were faring.\n\nWe weren‚Äôt near the river, so Milo had apparently tried to work with what he had: the soil at his feet had become a puddle of mud, and he stood ankle-deep in it. One of the remaining two tigers kept lunging for him, and each time it approached, he flung large, forceful balls of mud at it, sending it stumbling over roots or causing it to roar in pain as mud filled its nose and mouth. Milo‚Äôs eyes glowed deep blue. Still, even as I watched, the tiger was coming closer each time, and the puddle was dwindling. Without a larger water source, Milo wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep it up much longer.\n\nAsher, on the other hand, was‚Äîwhere else? ‚Äîin a tree. I squinted, the whole forest tilting around me, my vision blurring as the venom began to take hold. It was getting harder to tell, but it looked like Asher was standing on a tree branch, wielding daggers in each hand, swinging at the last tiger as it attempted to climb the tree to reach him. Blood sprayed across the dark roots as he sliced its paws.\n\nI had to help. The phoenix lighter didn‚Äôt have a large range, but if I could just get across the clearing, if I could just get closer to the two remaining tigers, I could open my lighter again and burn the other two monsters before they finished off my friends. \n\nEasy, right?\n\nWell, it would‚Äôve been, if the venom wasn‚Äôt rapidly spreading through my body. I made it a few steps, trudging through the ash and bones at my feet, reaching the lighter out in front of me. The woods were truly swaying now; I felt dizzy and nauseous all at once. Everything seemed to move both way too fast and in slow motion. It was like the world‚Äôs worst acid trip.\n\nI tried to tell Milo and Asher that I had the lighter, that it had killed one tiger and could kill theirs too, that I could throw it to them‚Äîbut I‚Äôm pretty sure all that came out was a groan. And then I fell. \n\nEverything was so blurry. I felt dull pain in my arm, saw the black-green smoke slowly wafting upwards from the festering wound there, heard the roars as the tigers continued to attack Milo and Asher. I tried to flick open the lighter, but my finger slipped, and the lighter tumbled onto the leaves beside me‚Äîmy eyes drifted shut, and everything began to sound very far away, like I was hearing it through a tunnel‚Äî\n\nI‚Äôm honestly not sure if I was conscious or not for the next few minutes. I remember it like a dream. A woman screamed. The tigers roared again, but it sounded different: anguished, not predatory. Flashes of light. And then something bitter dripping down my throat. After a few drops, as the taste sunk in, I jerked upright, coughing, retching at the bitter flavor.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to spit it up,‚Äù said a familiar voice by my head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an antidote. It‚Äôs saving your ass right now.‚Äù\n\nWith an effort, I stopped coughing and swallowed hard several times, wincing as the bitter liquid continued to drip down my throat. But Acacia was right: a few blinks later, my vision had cleared, and the clearing was steady around me. I looked down at my arm; beneath the ripped sleeve, the wound from the tiger‚Äôs fang was still bloody, but no longer festering. There were no traces of the previous black and green smoke. I felt‚Ä¶okay.\n\nI twisted to see Acacia crouching next to me, smirking. The resemblance between her and her brother had never been more obvious. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said.\n\nShe reached out a gloved hand and pulled me up to my feet behind her. I slowly glanced around. Milo was still standing ankle-deep in muddy water, looking exhausted. Dirt coated his arms and face, and his glasses were skewed, nearly falling off his face. Asher was still up on a tree branch, though he now sat on it, his legs dangling in the open air. \n\nThere were also two additional piles of ash, bones, and quills. As my gaze came full circle, I realized that a flamethrower, intricately carved with the same runes I‚Äôd seen on Asher‚Äôs, lay at Acacia‚Äôs feet. ‚ÄúDo all of you carry around flamethrowers?‚Äù I asked weakly.\n\nAsher grinned, jumping down from the branch and landing lightly, as if he‚Äôd merely stepped off a ledge. ‚ÄúExcept when we travel to the human dimension unexpectedly.‚Äù\n\nAcacia raised her eyebrows, looking back and forth between me and Asher. ‚ÄúIs *that* where you went? I guess I was right to be worried.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúMy bad,‚Äù I said.\n\nHer smirk returned. ‚ÄúYou sure are an interesting influence for my brother. Good or bad remains to be seen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, bad, definitely,‚Äù said Milo, stepping out of his puddle with an awful wet squelching sound. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a terrible influence. And I‚Äôm arguably worse. Milo, by the way. Wonderful to meet you.‚Äù\n\nAcacia took his outstretched hand. ‚ÄúAcacia. What‚Äôs a merman doing in the dark forest?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, you‚Äîyou figured that out, huh?‚Äù Milo said, with a little sheepish gesture at the puddle. ‚ÄúLong story.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot that long,‚Äù corrected Asher with a chuckle. ‚ÄúSame reason I nearly fell off a building in a human city: Ian.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I started to protest. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Äîokay, well, I guess that *is* technically true.‚Äù\n\nSomething roared in the distance. Acacia picked up her flamethrower and slung it over her shoulder as casually as it were a backpack. ‚ÄúCome on. I don‚Äôt have any more of that antidote on me, and those tigers aren‚Äôt even the worst things that could find us out here. We should head home. It‚Äôs not far.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòNot far‚Äô meaning we can walk there?‚Äù I asked hopefully, remembering Asher‚Äôs shadow travel with a shudder.\n\nAsher laughed out loud at the look on my face; Acacia smiled and said, ‚ÄúNot a fan of our methods, huh? You‚Äôre in luck. It‚Äôs close. As long as we hurry, we‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat are we waiting for, then?‚Äù interrupted Milo. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get away before more monster friends show up.‚Äù He hurried forward to fall in beside Acacia, who was already strolling out of the clearing and making her way into the trees.\n\nAs they vanished into the mess of dark, gnarled trunks, Asher turned to me, grinning. ‚ÄúHurry now, Ian. Wouldn‚Äôt want to resort to shadow travel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have to tell me twice,‚Äù I muttered. He began to pick his way over twisted roots, pushing branches out of his way, and I followed, half a step behind. We‚Äôd already lost sight of Acacia and Milo, but I was sure she‚Äôd take care of him. Plus, they had the flamethrower.\n\nHowever, this just left me and Asher, cautiously clambering over roots and through bushes in the darkness. \n\n‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I said as I focused on stepping exactly where Asher did, assuming he knew safe footholds. ‚ÄúYou know what I do. How I exist in both dimensions. How I‚Äîunintentionally‚Äîdo what you said was impossible.‚Äù I took a deep breath, feeling awkward. ‚ÄúWhat about you? What did you mean when you said your people exist on both the *Alive* and *Dead* planes?‚Äù\n\nAsher shrugged, glancing back at me over his shoulder as he held a thorny branch out of our way. ‚ÄúWe just do. Not exactly like you, though. I mean, I don‚Äôt just hang out in the afterlife. It‚Äôs more like‚Ä¶the division is thinner for us. I can sense death. I know when someone is closer to the border than usual. Which means I can tell when someone is about to die.‚Äù\n\nMy head was spinning; I barely noticed when the latest branch swatted me in the chest as I pushed past it. ‚ÄúHarbingers.‚Äù\n\nAsher grinned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. They called us that because we‚Äôd show up when we sensed someone close to death. To wait for their demise, and then guide them over the border between *Alive* and *Dead.* So if you saw us‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot good news,‚Äù I finished. ‚ÄúNo wonder they considered you bad omens.‚Äù\n\nAsher looked at me sharply, hopping over a massive root without even paying attention. I kept a closer eye on my feet, not trusting myself to stay upright if I lost focus. ‚ÄúWe *weren‚Äôt* bad omens or evil presences or whatever they believed. Superstitions, that‚Äôs all. We didn‚Äôt make anyone more likely to die; we just made sure we were there when they did.‚Äù He paused, considering. ‚ÄúOkay, I suppose I can see why they thought of us as omens of death.‚Äù\n\nI laughed. We fell silent for a moment, listening to the hisses and growls from the undergrowth around us. I could hear rustles and faint whispers up ahead from where I was sure Acacia and Milo walked, though it was dark enough that I still couldn‚Äôt see them.\n\nSuddenly Asher stopped moving; still staring intently at my own feet, I ran directly into him. His gloved hands grabbed my arms, steadying me, and I looked up to see that he had turned around to face me, his dark eyes intense. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt kill people, you know,‚Äù he said abruptly. ‚ÄúNot usually, at least. Despite our connections to death, we‚Äôre not evil.‚Äù\n\nI met his stare evenly. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLike I told Sky, I don‚Äôt think you are.‚Äù\n\nHe let his hands fall, giving me a tiny smile before he turned back and continued to pick his way across the blanket of crisscrossing roots. ‚ÄúThanks for that, by the way. It‚Äôs nice to have someone on our side. Weird, but nice.‚Äù\n\nI resumed walking, too, staying only a step behind. ‚ÄúI know the feeling.‚Äù Then a sudden thought occurred to me, and I couldn‚Äôt believe I hadn‚Äôt considered it earlier. ‚ÄúWait! If you can sense when someone is close to death, did you‚Ä¶did you sense that with my Uncle Henri before we left the bar?‚Äù My voice caught on Henri‚Äôs name. I had no idea what I‚Äôd do if he said he *had;* it just seemed like I had to ask.\n\nAsher didn‚Äôt turn around, but he shook his head as he continued forward. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt near the border.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd ever breathed a bigger sigh of relief in my life; I hadn‚Äôt even realized I was holding my breath. Thank God. For the first time since leaving [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/), my worry lessened a little.\n\n‚ÄúAlmost there,‚Äù said Asher.\n\nI barely even registered this, because *another* thought had occurred to me, and once again I found myself wondering how the hell I hadn‚Äôt put it together before. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you found me, isn‚Äôt it? Those times you magically seemed to know where I was in the dark forests? Because I was getting closer to the line between life and death!‚Äù I simultaneously felt like a genius, for finally snapping the puzzle pieces into place, and an idiot, for taking this long to do it.\n\nI heard the amusement in Asher‚Äôs voice and, even without seeing his face, knew he was smirking. ‚ÄúYou really just say whatever comes to mind, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúBut yeah. As someone nears the edge, I can sense that. And it guides me to the source.‚Äù\n\nI said the first thing that came to my head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty cool.‚Äù\n\nHe laughed. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs ever had that response before.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI like to stand out.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, I know,‚Äù he said. Then he suddenly held out an arm, halting me in my tracks. As I looked up, I realized that we had finally caught up to Acacia and Milo, who stood only a few steps ahead. Past them, I could make out houses between the thinned trees. We had reached Oasis.\n\n‚ÄúQuickly, now,‚Äù whispered Acacia. ‚ÄúBringing not one, but *two* outsiders in‚Äîespecially after the scene we made earlier‚Äîwon‚Äôt be a popular move. We‚Äôll have to be careful.‚Äù\n\nWe all looked at each other. Varying levels of concern were reflected on all of our faces; Milo seemed terrified. I nudged his shoulder with a small grin. ‚ÄúCome on, Milo. You‚Äôve been through way worse during your association with me.‚Äù\n\nHe smiled nervously, running a hand through his already-wild blue hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm used to you. It‚Äôs new dangers that scare me.‚Äù\n\nAsher said, ‚ÄúYou just walked barefoot through a forest full of thorns and monsters. You‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù\n\nAcacia shrugged and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better get used to it.‚Äù\n\nI looped my arm through Milo‚Äôs, winked at him, and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fun. And we probably won‚Äôt even accidentally jump to the human dimension.‚Äù\n\nMilo looked at me, and his smile widened. His blue eyes seemed to sparkle behind his glasses. ‚ÄúPromise?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNever,‚Äù I said solemnly. \n\n‚ÄúWell, come on then,‚Äù said Acacia, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúMay as well get it over with.‚Äù \n\nWith a deep breath, trying to ignore the lingering soreness of the ashen handprints on my neck from the last time I‚Äôd been seen here, I followed her out of the trees, Asher and Milo beside me. \n\nAt least whatever came next, I wouldn‚Äôt be facing it alone.",

        "text": "As the title suggests, something strange has been going on with my grandmother. It started about a month ago. That‚Äôs when I started writing down anything she said or did that was out of the ordinary. It has progressed into something truly bizarre and frightening. These are the logs that I‚Äôve kept since it started.\n\nMy grandma just had a moment of clarity! She had a moment of true lucidity! I guess I should back up a little. \n\nI‚Äôve basically lived with my grandmother all my life. My mother passed shortly after giving birth to me and oddly, so did my grandfather. Dad was never around. It‚Äôs not important why.. The point is I never really had parents. I had my grandma.\n\nOur family is very small. My grandmother's only other children were my aunt and uncle who have both passed. My uncle was gone before I was born. My aunt passed away when I was about 13. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long after that that grandma started showing signs of Alzheimer‚Äôs. Prior to that she would occasionally forget someone‚Äôs name. Nothing major though. \n\nAfter my aunt passed it was just me and grandma. She was a very sweet lady who always wanted to take care of people. I just feel like life isn‚Äôt fair. She didn‚Äôt deserve to have this happen to her. She outlived all her children and then gets Alzheimer‚Äôs. If it was going to happen, it could have at least happened before the majority of the family was gone.. \n\nShe had been through a lot. I can‚Äôt imagine how that feels. Aside from my aunt, I barely remember any of the family. For grandma to lose so many people in such a short time is just awful. \n\nGrandma did have a wild side though. Hell, she once held a gas station up at needlepoint.. sorry‚Ä¶ That was cheesy. Figured I‚Äôd lighten the mood a bit. This is getting a bit depressing but the reason I‚Äôm writing this is because something amazing just happened!\n\nFirst I have to explain grandma's condition. She started slowly losing it in my early teen years. She was still able to take care of herself but would become confused pretty easily. At first it was just a once in a while thing. A slip up here or there. It progressed pretty quickly though..\n\nBy the time I was about 16 or 17, she needed an aid. I took care of her most of the time but had to go to school. Grandma lived on what was left of the ‚Äúfamily money‚Äù, and was able to afford an aid to come while I was at school.\n\nThe family money is a bit of a mystery to me. From what grandma told me when I was younger, my grandpa used to be pretty wealthy. That is a zillionaire, but technically a millionaire. Especially for our little town, he was a wealthy guy.\n\nHe owned a few small businesses back in the day but ended up selling them. I‚Äôm not sure why there isn‚Äôt much money left, honestly. Maybe they spoiled their kids when they were around. Maybe they made some bad investments. \n\nMy grandmother worked full time until she was 60. I would think she‚Äôd have retirement that she‚Äôs been living off so I don‚Äôt understand why there isn‚Äôt more money. I‚Äôm not worried about an inheritance or anything like that. It‚Äôs just the fact that we can‚Äôt afford an aid anymore. \n\nHer mental health deteriorated steadily over the years. After high school, I got a job right away to try to help out. Grandma had told me multiple times that she never wanted to be put in a nursing home under any circumstances. I figured I could work and help her at the same time so she could stay in her home.\n\nThis worked for a while but got tougher over time. We had an aid who would come for a little while each day to help her eat and go to the bathroom. \n\nBy this point, she recognized me but didn‚Äôt completely remember me. She was doing strange things like hanging pizza on the clothesline or putting a sponge in the microwave. I‚Äôd be lying if I said the pizza on the clothesline didn‚Äôt make me chuckle a bit, but I knew that it was getting dangerous. She wasn‚Äôt able to be home alone for any amount of time anymore.\n\nWe were unable to pay for a full-time aid so I ended up leaving my job. Between my savings and the last of the family money, we had enough to eat and pay the bills. It was just barely enough, but we got by. \n\nThat‚Äôs pretty much where we are now. I do some freelance work. I‚Äôve been selling some stuff online. Stuff like that. I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and I‚Äôll figure out my life when grandma is gone.. She needs me. I‚Äôm all she has now..\n\nGrandma‚Äôs mental state has been rough. She doesn‚Äôt talk much anymore. Mostly mumbles. She struggles to find the words but can usually communicate what she needs. It‚Äôs usually some mumbles and I can vaguely hear ‚Äúwater‚Äù or ‚Äúhungry‚Äù, ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù, ect.  \n\nThat‚Äôs what brings me to why I‚Äôm writing this. She hasn‚Äôt been able to have a real conversation in a few years. Today though, something happened. \n\nI ran to the store down the street real quick. I was only gone for a few minutes. When I got back, I walked into the living room and saw grandma sitting in her chair staring out the window. \n\nShe had a big smile on her face. That was odd. She didn‚Äôt convey much emotion these days and almost never positive emotions. I asked her ‚ÄúWhatcha doin grandma?‚Äù \n\nI was stunned when she replied.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for the guys,‚Äù she said. \n\nI couldn‚Äôt believe it. Regardless if what she said made sense, she hadn‚Äôt spoken a full coherent sentence in over a year. I asked her to elaborate.\n\n‚ÄúThe guys?‚Äù I asked. \n\n‚ÄúTommy and Eric are comin over and we‚Äôre gonna go skateboarding.‚Äù She replied.\n\nThis was even more strange. Tommy and Eric are the names of my childhood best friends. We‚Äôd go skateboarding around town all the time. That was before grandma started having issues.\n\nI tried to keep her talking but it was like a switch flipped and she went back to mumbling. She had a moment of clarity though! A moment where she could speak clearly like she used to. \n\nShe seemed to recover a memory. It was my memory though. She knew my friends' names back then though. She could have remembered me saying that. It‚Äôs odd, but I‚Äôm taking it as a win. She showed that she could improve. If she had one moment of lucidity, she could have more! \n\nIt‚Äôs been a week since she spoke. I was losing hope and starting to think it was a fluke. It wasn‚Äôt though! Today, it happened again! \n\nI was watching tv in the living room while grandma was in bed taking a nap. I heard a noise and immediately jumped up to see if she was okay. I got to the hallway to see her walking toward me with a big smile on her face. She can still walk, but she doesn‚Äôt much and she never moves this fast. \n\n‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù She replied excitedly. ‚ÄúHas the mail come yet?‚Äù  \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it has yet today. Why do you ask?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúMy new board should be here today!‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYour board?‚Äù I asked. \n\n‚ÄúSkateboard! It‚Äôs a Zero deck with Tensor trucks! I got Spitfire wheels and Bones bearings. I‚Äôve been saving up for it for months! You can pick all your parts on the site and they assemble it for you! I got it without the grip tape on though so I can cut a design into it and put it on myself.‚Äù \n\nWow! That wasn‚Äôt just a sentence. It was a detailed explanation! I don‚Äôt get it though. Even if she remembered me waiting for my board to be delivered, how did she know all those details? \n\nShe wouldn‚Äôt have known those brands or skateboard parts even before Alzheimer's. She had no idea what I was talking about at the time. \n\nShe was right though.. Every detail. She described my skateboard perfectly. I must have been 13 at the time. I did order that board. I did get a grip tape separate so I could cut a design into it. I remember that it came out looking really terrible. I just.. don‚Äôt get how she‚Äôd know the details.\n\nI asked her to further elaborate but after describing the skateboard, she seemed to return to mumbling and muttering again. It was strange to watch her pop in and out of lucidity so rapidly. It was more strange that in her lucid moments, she seemed to think that she was me.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt explain it and I couldn‚Äôt find it any information on anything similar. I called her doctor. He said that it was possible for her to have moments of lucidity. He didn‚Äôt seem to grasp how detailed her explanation was though. She remembered something she wouldn‚Äôt have even known at the time. At any point in time. \n\nTwo days later, it happened again. I saw her sitting on the couch with that smile. I asked if everything was okay. Her smile turned into a look of shame. Then she told me about something that she had hidden under her bed. \n\nNow, I'm not gonna say what that something was. I did have something hidden under my bed when I was a kid though. Something embarrassing.\n\nDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs nothing crazy. I‚Äôm not a psycho. It wasn't a severed head. I‚Äôm not a weirdo. It wasn‚Äôt a picture of a severed head. I‚Äôm not a pervert. It‚Äôs not a picture of someone receiving severed head.. it‚Äôs just something embarrassing that I never told anyone. It doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with a severed head.. Just using that as an example.\n\nI mean it that I never told anyone. I never told a friend or a girlfriend. I‚Äôm positive I never told grandma. If she would have found it at the time, she would have said something to me at the time. Apologies again for not saying what it is, just know that it‚Äôs nothing crazy or scary or gross. \n\nThe point is that she knew. For the third time, she seemed to recover in memory of mine. This time, I have no possible explanation for how she could have known. She simply couldn‚Äôt have. \n\nSomehow, she is recovering my memories. I‚Äôm over the moon to see that she‚Äôs having moments of lucidity and that she‚Äôs recovering memories. I just can‚Äôt get past how bizarre it is that those memories are mine. \n\nI called her doctor again. She has an upcoming appointment in a couple weeks so he suggested we talk about it then. I‚Äôm frustrated by how uninterested he‚Äôs been. Something very strange is happening with his patient. \n\nHe could be a part of some medical breakthrough. If they can study what is going on with her, maybe they can figure out how to help other people afflicted with these ailments. Maybe they can help her recover her own memories.\n\nIt‚Äôs been another three days since she mentioned what was under the bed when I was a kid. I decided to try and spark some of her own memories. I brought up some old curtains from the basement and hung them up. I regularly asked her about her marriage and her childhood, but nothing seemed to work. I asked about her childhood home. I asked about her school years. Nothing. She just responded with the usual muttering.\n\nIt had been almost a week since her last ‚Äúmoment of lucidity‚Äù before it happened again. She told me that she was gonna take some time off of work to spend more time with me.. She said it exactly how I said it to her when I left my job to take care of her. Then again, she went back to muttering. \n\nI tried to get a recording of her in these lucid moments, but it was like she knew when I was recording. They were also too random to know when they would come. After she told me she was taking work off for a while, I only had to wait a day for the next lucid moment. \n\nShe was sitting on the couch by the window when I walked into the room. When she noticed me, she quickly asked if I was okay. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. How are you feeling?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling fine,‚Äù She replied. ‚ÄúI just gotta know, how did you know about my skateboard and the thing under my bed when I was a kid? What can you remember now? Can you remember when you got married? Do you remember having kids?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI uhh.. I..‚Äù\n\nI started muttering. I had no idea how to respond to that. She was asking me the exact same questions I had just asked her the last time she seemed lucid. It‚Äôs like she was recovering my memories all the way up to the present. Did she think I was her? Did she think she was me? \n\nI‚Äôve been anxiously awaiting the upcoming doctor's appointment. I need to know what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I‚Äôve dedicated so much time to taking care of her that I don‚Äôt really have other people in my life. There‚Äôs no one to talk to about this and the doctor has been frustratingly nonchalant about my concerns. \n\nWe are now two days away from the doctor‚Äôs appointment and grandma seems to be having a lucid moment. As I‚Äôve been observing her, I‚Äôve noticed a specific look she gets on her face before the lucid moments come. I‚Äôm attempting to dictate what she‚Äôs saying to me in real time. I‚Äôm using voice dictation on my phone to help, so forgive me for random typos that might occur.\n\nThis time seems different from the others. She doesn‚Äôt seem happy. She doesn‚Äôt seem excited or nostalgic. She seems shook, for lack of a better term. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm back! Oh my god! I‚Äôm back!‚Äù She said with a look of relief on her face. \n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening? How are you feeling?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs..‚Äù. She paused and looked around for a minute. ‚ÄúOh no.,‚Äù she said somberly. \n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? What happened? Where are you back from?‚Äù I asked.\n\nI didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her and her delicate state, but I had to get as much information as possible when she had these moments. She was very confused at first, but articulate more so than usual. When I asked where she had come back from, she had a horrified look on her face. \n\n(Voice dictation from phone) \n\n‚ÄúThe dark place.. they‚Äôre going to come and get me and take me there all over again!‚Äù She yelled as her calm demeanor turned into a panic. \n\n‚ÄúThe dark place?‚Äù I asked. \n\nShe just paused and may be losing her lucidity. She went from calm, to afraid, and now has a look of pure misery on her face.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pain beyond comprehension,‚Äù she said as she tried to catch her breath. ‚ÄúIt's physical pain beyond anything anyone could ever imagine. It‚Äôs almost like you feel more. Pain hurts more. Mental agony hurts more. They torture you in ways human beings can‚Äôt even comprehend. The dark place is Indescribable misery. It can‚Äôt be explained in ways human beings can understand. Living humans aren‚Äôt capable of understanding it.‚Äù \n\nI began to ask her a follow up question but she continued.\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the senses necessary to comprehend all of it. There is physical pain.. Immense physical pain. As well as mental torment beyond anything you could ever pretend to imagine.. There‚Äôs more to it though than just that. Those are just the aspects that can be described in a way that we can understand.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äú I asked nervously.\n\n‚ÄúThere are aspects of life in the universe around us that we are unable to recognize or see. There‚Äôs things all around us that we can‚Äôt visualize because we don‚Äôt have the senses necessary. When you‚Äôre in the dark place, you develop those new senses‚Ä¶ and you experience those new sensations. And they‚Äôre more horrible than anything you could ever fathom..‚Äù \n\nI am completely confused and frightened by what she is telling me. What is this dark place she‚Äôs talking about? What are these sensations she‚Äôs referring to?\n\n‚ÄúAre you talking about like‚Ä¶ hell?‚Äù I asked while somewhat wondering if I had completely lost my mind myself. \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.. I guess it‚Äôs something like that. Different civilizations have had different interpretations of these dark places‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think any of them got it right. They talk about fire and brimstone. I wish there was fire. Anything to light up the darkness. It always feels like I‚Äôm on fire. That doesn‚Äôt even compare to the other sensations though. I don‚Äôt even think we have words to describe them. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs extraterrestrial, if it‚Äôs hell, or a dimensional rip into a place more horrible than anything I could have ever imagined..‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre home now.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôll come back for me eventually.. just like they did back then.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBack when?‚Äù I asked urgently. ‚ÄúWhen did they take you?‚Äú\n\n‚ÄúYears ago.. I think it‚Äôs years. There‚Äôs no way to tell. They mess with your head to the point that you can‚Äôt keep track of time and can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs happening aside from the misery and pain.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù I said, confused and frightened.\n\n‚ÄúDo you know why that was happening?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúMy grandfather.. We used to all think the family was cursed. Poor grandma outlived all of her children. She would also eventually outlive her grandchild.. My grandfather made a deal with someone. I don‚Äôt know who it is. All I know is that he sacrificed the rest of us.. he bargained for grandma to be able to live to be 100 years old. They just didn‚Äôt tell him that she would start losing her mind in her 70s. She would outlive her own mind.. All of his descendants would be damned to the dark place. He didn‚Äôt know how awful it really was. He‚Äôs a human being, and human beings aren‚Äôt physically able to comprehend the things they experienced in the dark place.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre telling me that‚Äôs how grandpa got his money? He just sacrificed the entire family?‚Äù \n\nI asked this question in an almost sarcastic tone. I figured that grandmother‚Äôs newfound lucidity had crossed over with her mental impairments. \n\n‚ÄúYes he did..‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúGrandma told me this right before they came.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBefore they came? Before who came?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúI never get a good look at them. It‚Äôs so dark.. for so long. I can hear the awful sounds they make. I can feel the pain they inflict. I endure the further sensations.. Those are the worst.. The ones I can‚Äôt comprehend, but I can experience. It‚Äôs immense misery that‚Äôs literally beyond comprehension.. No one on earth has felt this level of agony.. You never get used to it either. They somehow take away your ability to build up a threshold for pain, depression, and overall misery.. They know how to keep it constant.‚Äù\n\nGrandma started coughing after telling me this. I went to the kitchen and got her a glass of water. She still seemed to be in a state of fear and panic when I returned. \n\n‚ÄúWhen did they take you?‚Äù I asked as she sipped the water. \n\n‚ÄúI knew something weird was going on,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMy grandma who had been afflicted with dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs randomly started having moments of lucidity. I tried to keep track of them. I started realizing that they weren‚Äôt her memories. They were mine.‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening. She seemed to be recalling my past memories. Then she seemed to be recalling my present memories. Now, it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs describing what I‚Äôve been going through with her. I figured I might as well ask her what would happen next.\n\n‚ÄúWhen did they come? What happened with.. ‚Äúyour‚Äù grandma?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúShe told me about the dark place. She described it as best as a living human being could. I got her some water and inquired further.. Then there was a knock on the door..‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm trying to process this all in real time as I write this. Grandma hasn‚Äôt been lucid for this long in years. There are tears streaming down her face as she tries to describe ‚Äúthe dark place‚Äù. Is it something caused by her ailments? Hallucinations maybe? Is her lucidity more local than mental? Could this be all from her imagination?\n\nHer crying started to get worse as I finished typing that. It was just a few tears and some sniffling but it has turned into a full blown sobbing now. She keeps talking about how horrible and indescribable the dark place is. It‚Äôs hard to tell if she‚Äôs really in a state of lucidity or not, but as I finished writing this down, she addressed me by my name.\n\n‚ÄúShawn!‚Äù She shouted. \n\n‚ÄúYes! It‚Äôs me, grandma!‚Äù I replied, I was excited because she hadn‚Äôt remembered my name in years. \n\n‚ÄúThis was the conversation..‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄúWhat conversation?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúThe last one we ever had..‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the exact conversation I had with my grandmother before they arrived,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey banged on the door. Grandma told me to run. I ran into the basement as they broke through the front door. I rushed down there and locked it from the inside. I could hear someone stomping upstairs and it sounded like they walked right past grandma. They weren‚Äôt here for her. They were here for me.‚Äù\n\nI just tried to speak but she continued.\n\n‚ÄúI took my phone out and wrote down the last observations and conversations with grandma. I figured that someone needed to know. I posted it online as they broke through the basement door. It wasn‚Äôt long before they found me..‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGrandm..‚Äù \n\nShe interrupted again.\n\n‚ÄúAs it approached me, my vision blurred. My ears started ringing so loudly that I thought they would explode. I felt it surround me. It, them.. I don't really know who..‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm struggling to grasp what she‚Äôs saying. The dark place she describes sounds like hell, but she claims it‚Äôs worse. Why is she remembering my memories and why does she think she went to this dark place? Is this what she feels when she isn‚Äôt lucid?\n\nGrandma I just started muttering again. The muttering usually means she isn‚Äôt lucid. She keeps looking over at the door and she still looks scared.. \n\nI was about to get up and go for a walk to clear my head, but there was a knock on the door moments ago.. Seconds after she heard the knocking, grandma looked me dead in the eyes and said ‚Äúrun.‚Äù \n\nI‚Äôm in the basement now.. Something just broke through the front door.. They‚Äôre about to break through the basement door.. I‚Äôm posting now. I‚Äôm out of time and someone needs to know what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôm still not completely sure.. I just... Shit! They‚Äôre in.. I love you grandma..",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1102qb7/a_random_woman_on_the_street_gave_me_a_valentines/",
        "text": "It read, ‚ÄúWill you be mine?‚Äù There was no name, no one to whom it had originally addressed; just a crumpled red envelope, and a (mostly) blank white card, with the aforementioned question written inside on the right. The black ink had smeared, either at the time of writing or sometime during its travels through the curious woman‚Äôs pocket. It somehow made the question seem sad, desperate.  \n\nShe gave me one last glance, then stepped away; mingling with the crowd that seemed to appear from out of nowhere at that very moment. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and had anyone else given it to me, I probably would‚Äôve tossed it. But the woman had been strangely, unconventionally attractive, so I kept it. I used it to buoy my spirits after what had been a particularly frustrating day at work. She could‚Äôve given it to anyone, but she‚Äôd chosen me. \n\nBack home, I set it on the kitchen counter and started to make myself something to eat. A few minutes into dinner preparations, I got this feeling in the back of my neck, like there was someone watching me. Turning around, I scanned my small apartment, able to see the entirety of the kitchen and the living room beyond from where I was standing at the stove. There wasn‚Äôt anyone in sight, and yet I still felt as if I were being *observed.* It was around 8pm, night had already set in, but my living room curtains were still open. I crossed the room, closed them, and returned to the kitchen.  \n\nThe ominous¬†feeling lingered, but I ignored it¬†and finished cooking.  \n\nHalfway through eating dinner there was a knock at the door. I‚Äôd never had anyone stop by to visit before, so the occurrence was at once alarming. I sat there, frozen mid-chew, hoping that there‚Äôd been some kind of mistake; but another knock came. Rising from the table, I gripped my fork in my hand and crept toward the front door, trying not to announce my occupancy of the apartment. Reaching the door, I peered through the peephole, not exactly dreading what I‚Äôd see, but hoping not to see anyone.  \n\nMy hope panned out‚Äîthere wasn‚Äôt anyone there. And yet this unnerved me, because I hadn‚Äôt heard any departing footsteps.  \n\nCarefully, fork gripped tightly in my right hand, I opened the door an inch. No one occupied the space beyond, so I opened it all the way. The threshold was empty. Both ends of the hall were empty. I didn‚Äôt notice the evidence that anyone had even been there until I took a tentative step into the hall. Turning around to re-enter my apartment, I saw that someone had written something on the door. An unsettlingly familiar phrase: ‚ÄúWill you be my mine?‚Äù  \n\nAnd just like the ink in the card, the writing‚Äîdark paint, I hoped‚Äîwas smeared; the letter ‚Äúe‚Äù in ‚Äúmine‚Äù no more than a trailing blot.  \n\nI hurried back inside and slammed the door. My heart was going crazy; I sensed that *something* was happening, that I was being subjected to some kind of prank or harassment. I had to hold onto the wall as I made my way back to the kitchen ‚Äì my anxiety making my steps unsteady.  \n\nAs I returned to my seat at the table‚Äì my appetite utterly lost ‚Äì I was suddenly beset with the urge to look at the card again; to *read* it again, even though I knew what was written inside. I went over, grabbed it from the counter, and sat back down at; shoving my unwanted dinner aside. I withdrew the card from its envelope and set it on the table, a feeling of mounting unrest making my hands tremble. The blank white face of the card seemed to augur some terrible yet unguessable news; an infinite array of cryptic possibilities.  \n\nFinally, I willed my hands to open the card. Inside, written on every single inch of space, was the phrase, ‚ÄúWill you be mine?‚Äù. Over and over, in every direction, some instances more erratic than others; there was a terrible and terrifying variety to the scribblings. I‚Äôd never felt more disturbed by such a relatively simple thing.¬†¬† \n\nwill you be mine? \n\n*Will you be mine???* \n\n**WILL YOU BE MINE?!** \n\nI threw the card away. But after a few moments spent on the couch trying to calm myself, I got up, fetched my candle lighter, and burned the card in the kitchen sink. As the flames consumed it, crumpling and blackening the material, I felt a new sensation; not exactly nausea, but a bodily lightness. I gripped the counter, attempting to steady myself. It wasn‚Äôt until I had practically keeled over that I noticed the fumes weren‚Äôt grey or black or the color of any smoke I‚Äôd seen before‚Äîbut *red,* as red as the envelope the card had been in.  \n\nConsciousness began to ebb¬†away just as I heard the front door open.¬†I remembered then that I hadn‚Äôt locked the door‚ÄîI‚Äôd merely slammed it in my panic. ‚ÄúYou idiot.‚Äù I thought to myself as darkness took me.  \n\nI awoke on my kitchen table, and the first thing I noticed was the chill ‚Äì I was naked; had been stripped completely. Given the circumstances ‚Äìas terrible as they were - I expected to be bound; but I was not, and promptly rolled off the table when I shifted my weight. I landed hard on my shoulder, and briefly hoped that I‚Äôd pass out again, if only to stop the flare of pain.  \n\nRecovering, using the table for leverage, I stood up. My senses were rekindled completely when I saw what was smeared on the table‚Äôs surface. It was, unmistakably, blood. *My blood.* As if activated by the sight, my nerves exploded, and pain coursed down the front of my body. I fell to my knees, my body over-wrought with agony. With one eye open‚Äîthe other closed, as if that‚Äôd somehow mollify the pain‚ÄîI examined myself.  \n\nFrom the top of my chest all the way down to my groin was the word ‚ÄúMine.‚Äù Carved into my skin, as erratically as the darkly enigmatic question in the card. It was like I had been claimed, the word lacking a question mark; the wounds‚Äîstill fresh‚Äîa grisly statement of ownership.  \n\nEvery movement, no matter how subtle, brought a new spike of breath-stealing pain, so I just stayed there; kneeling on my kitchen floor, as errant streams of blood trickled from the wounds that had not yet coagulated. My one attempt to call for help brought so much pain that I almost fainted, so I refrained from doing even that; not wanting to bleed out while unconscious.  \n\nI stayed like that for over an hour, until my body had grown somewhat accustomed to the debilitation. Then I stood, cringing against the only slightly diminished agony‚Äîand¬†shedding no small number of tears‚Äîand called the police.  \n\nThey came, I was taken to the hospital, and they investigated what they could of my apartment and the evidence therein.  \n\nI‚Äôve yet to hear any news of a lead or idea of the perpetrator; they‚Äôve only informed me that the card‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd burned‚Äîhad been taken into evidence. I was shocked at this, and it must‚Äôve shown on my face because the officer asked if something was wrong. I asked him how they had recovered the card, given what I‚Äôd done, and he said that there wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with it ‚Äì that the *alleged* fire hadn‚Äôt damaged it at all.  \n\nAn itch in the back of my mind compelled me to ask him another question, even as I grappled to comprehend what he‚Äôd told me.  \n\n‚ÄúWhat did the card say inside?‚Äù  \n\nThe officer met my eyes for a moment, a look of slight bewilderment on his face.  \n\n‚ÄúIt said, ‚ÄúI'm glad you‚Äôre mine.‚Äô‚Äù  \n\nOnce I‚Äôm well enough to leave the hospital, I‚Äôm finding a new place to live. The landlord can have everything in my apartment - I'm never going back there. For the first time in my life, I‚Äôm happy I'll be spending Valentine‚Äôs Day alone.",

        "text": " His fingers were fat and greasy with the oils of the fries he was eating. His face was hollow, yet full in a way it was hard to comprehend.\n\nThere was an air of cruel disgust to the man, one unlike anything I‚Äôd ever seen before. I‚Äôd had jobs working for dirty and rundown fast food places before, and I‚Äôd seen my share of wild- but this, this man. \n\nWell, he wasn‚Äôt like anything I‚Äôd ever seen before.\n\nBut it wasn‚Äôt the way he looked like, no, his pale eyes, yellowed skin and meaty look was common of those who feasted upon the flesh of genetically modified meats. No, it was the way he ate the meal.\n\nIt was like he was swallowing the burgers he had ordered, taking large bites and clumsily swallowing the meal, not bothering to chew on it with teeth I imagined to be a sharp as knives. \n\nAnd then there were the condiments. He kept opening sauces, mustard, tomato. He kept adding salt, pepper, chili- as if the mess wasn‚Äôt enough already. And all, one by one, he gulped it down, his lips making obscene noises that quite frankly- disturbed me.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staring, Jamie,‚Äù I heard my boss, Pamela, say.\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I puzzled, not realizing I was staring directly at the glutton feasting on his meal. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I repeated, as if I hadn‚Äôt heard her say it once.\n\n‚ÄúJamie, you‚Äôre staring,‚Äù she reiterated, a sharp tone in her voice this time.\n\nI realized I was and shrewdly apologized to my boss. It was like I was entranced by the way the man was eating, by the sheer horror of his lips smacking, crumbs falling, moist fluids spraying and-\n\nI decided it was better not to think about it.\n\n‚ÄúWho is that guy?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy does he‚Ä¶ eat like that?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDunno,‚Äù Pam replied. ‚ÄúHe came in here about two months ago. Ever since then, he‚Äôs been here every now and again, eating.‚Äù\n\nJust my luck. Of course some weirdo shows up the third day I find myself a job.\n\nWell, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a job, really- not a proper one. Working at McDonalds is hardly a job, but I needed some money, and the place was the first one I‚Äôd found.\n\n‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I managed. ‚ÄúWhy does he eat so much?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNobody knows,‚Äù Pam confessed. ‚ÄúHe eats so much of the food here we call him something, actually.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe Hungry Man,‚Äù she laughed.\n\nI didn‚Äôt find it funny. I laughed along anyway. Deep down, I felt a sense of uneasiness, a sense of despair, a sense of utter confusion. I stared at my phone instead of the man, playing a game of Word Hunt with my brother, Alex.\n\nI was in the middle of finally winning against him when I heard a shuffling of feet, and I looked up- and nearly yelped to see none other than the Hungry Man right in front of me.\n\nHe was even worse up close. \n\nBeads of drooling sweat trailed down his forehead, making their way down to his cheeks, where an uneven beard lay, which was disgusting, tangled, and plain gross. Bits and pieces of meat were stuck inside it, meat that reeked like it was days-old, instead of the ‚Äòfresh‚Äô McDonald‚Äôs meal he‚Äôd just eaten.\n\n‚ÄúUm,‚Äù I stuttered, ‚Äúwhat do you need, Mr‚Ä¶?‚Äù\n\nWhen he spoke, I nearly retched in horror. ‚ÄúI would like,‚Äù he clumsily mumbled, revealing flesh, bones, and something brown and sticky that definitely hadn‚Äôt been inside the meal Pam had served him before, ‚Äúthree Grand Macs, and whatever soda you have back there. And it‚Äôs *Beelz*. That is who I am. And I am very hungry.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll get your meal as s-soon as possible.‚Äù\n\nHe patiently waited while I went to the back and asked one of my coworkers to get the meal, all while trying to remove the sickly sweet smell of his breath from my lungs.\n\nSoon, I turned back to face the man, and handed over the quickly put meal, facing his rancid air once again. Was it his breath that caused the air to stink like carrion? Or was it something else- his entire flesh, emitting a beastly and gluttonous odor.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt tell.\n\n‚ÄúWe hope you enjoy your meal,‚Äù I cheerfully quoted.\n\nThe man smiled once again, revealing rows of dirty teeth too horrible for me to describe. Some were still functionable, yet some were chipped, broken, and seemed to have bits and pieces of flesh embedded inside them.\n\nI hoped he wouldn‚Äôt enjoy his meal. I hoped he would leave and never come back.\n\nAs he turned back to his seat- which had an awfully colored puddle covering it, I noticed how his body sagged, trailing behind as the man strolled clumsily to his seat. \n\nIt was almost as if they were merely bags of meat lazily strapped to his body, bags full of flesh and bones that were attachments, as if they would drop at the slightest touch, or gale of a wind.\n\nEvery instinct inside me told me that this man was wrong somehow. No human should have looked like that. There was just something wrong with the way he looked- I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was the array of dirtied teeth, or the ogling way he eyed me, or the flesh that looked like bags of meat rather than a human person- but something was wrong.\n\nAnd yet, I couldn‚Äôt find a logical reason to verify my instincts. \n\nMy brother Alex always told me I relied on logic too much, that one day, there would come a time I‚Äôd have to use my natural instincts- follow my gut, follow my brain. Fight or flight- that stuff.\n\nI watched, disturbed as flies surrounded the man, almost as if he was a decomposing carcass. They landed on him, yet he didn‚Äôt seem to notice. \n\nThe man that didn‚Äôt seem like a man slowly raised a hand and grasped the first of the three burgers. Clumsily, the man dropped it, sending a shocked yet uncaring expression on his face.\n\nIt fell on the floor, which was already dirty from the crumbs he‚Äôd made from eating earlier. It looked more unsanitary than any other part of the dirty McDonald‚Äôs, as if there was something that couldn‚Äôt be cleaned from the place he sat.\n\nThe Hungry Man took the unclean thing that was the burger from the ground, and as he took it up, his eyes met mine, and then, he stared at me as a‚Ä¶ smile appeared on his face- and for a second, his teeth were wrong.\n\nThey weren‚Äôt chipped, they weren‚Äôt broken- no, instead, they were stained canine teeth, rows and rows of them. He continued to stare at me with this uncanny hunger in his eyes as he lifted the burger up, picked up a small packet of mustard- placed it into the burger-\n\nAnd ate it.\n\nI saw it enter his mouth, and the knife-sharp teeth chew once, twice- and the man which wasn‚Äôt a man- but a gluttonous thing inside a man swallow the burger. I saw the meat and breads fall down his throat, but it didn‚Äôt look right at all.\n\nThe man coughed, once, twice- but never broke his stare at me. His eyes looked hungry- hungry for flesh. Hungry for blood. Hungry for- me.\n\n‚ÄúI told you not to stare, Jamie,‚Äù Pam scolded. I didn‚Äôt listen. I had to stare at the thing that wasn‚Äôt a man yet at was the same time. I had to watch. And he had to stare back- because if I took my eyes off for even a second- I was scared of what I‚Äôd see next. ‚ÄúJamie!‚Äù\n\nI think this is what my brother meant when he told me a fight or flight situation would come up one day.\n\nI felt cold hands on my shoulder, and was spun around by Pamela. I was shaken out of my trance, and for a moment, I forgot all about the Hungry Man, and what he was doing.\n\n‚ÄúSorry, sorry,‚Äù I apologized. ‚ÄúHe was staring at me and he ate that and-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Pam assured. ‚ÄúListen, we‚Äôre closing up soon- can you stay here while I close up everything else?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I murmured. \n\nBut‚Ä¶ that couldn‚Äôt have been right. It was nowhere near closing time the last time I‚Äôd checked- and yet, now the clock read 10:48 PM, which was for sure more than an hour more than the last time I‚Äôd checked.\n\nHad I been staring at the man for that long? \n\nPam went off to go close up. Meanwhile, I heard a loud and inconsiderate retch and a burp, coming straight from the man. The customers around him seemed to edge away, being just as disgusted by his form as I was.\n\nBy 10:55 everyone but the man had left. We closed at 11, yet the man was still there, still in a pile of his juices, fluids, and crumbs of meat and bread all around him. He was chewing on the final remnants of the last burger now, making obscene noises that were surely loud enough for the store next door to hear.\n\nAnd when he was done, he let out a belch that I swore made the air seem dead and rancid. \n\n10:58. \n\nThis meant I‚Äôd have to ask him to leave myself. I wondered if Pam was going to be back soon. Usually, it took a while for Pam to be back, and at times like these, it was expected of me to remove the customers.\n\nIn this case, customer.\n\n‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I called, walking over. I had forgotten the man‚Äôs name, but I swore it was Bee‚Ä¶ something. It meant something as I read his sweat-drenched t-shirt, which had his name on it, but it was obscured by a piece of ignored, fly-swarmed meat.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for you to leave.‚Äù\n\nHe slammed the table with a hand, scaring me. It also revealed his name- *Beelz Bubbins.* I was sure it meant something- I just couldn‚Äôt figure out what. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not finished yet.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUm, you don‚Äôt seem to have any food remaining,‚Äù I hesitated. ‚ÄúCan you please handle payment.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI said,‚Äù the man repeated. He practically shook the table as he rammed a fist into it, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not finished yet.‚Äù\n\nAnd in a second, I saw that there was something wrong with the way he looked. His face was like that of a beast in the wilderness, his teeth were sharper than anything I‚Äôd ever seen, and there was a truly voracious look in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúSir-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm still hungry!‚Äù he growled.\n\nI stepped back. No, I ran back. I ran back to the counter and to my radio, alerting Pam of the situation. \n\nBehind me, I heard a sickening crunch of flesh and bone, and I turned back to see something that would be etched into my memory forever.\n\nThe man- the thing that wasn‚Äôt a man had an arm up, and it was gnawing- no, devouring it. Blood poured out of the meaty limb, pus and a liquid I can‚Äôt seem to describe oozing out as the thing ate, chewing on recently fattened flesh.\n\nI threw up that moment, and when I looked back up, I saw that the man had devoured half his arm- in some places, right down to bone.\n\nI saw white against red as the man bit down, removing another chunk of flesh and practically- no, literally swallowing it down his throat. With every bite, more blood leaked out, more fluids, more everything.\n\nHe was not in pain as his jaw and rows of teeth seemed to wrap itself around the bone, and then snapping down, all while staring directly at me, a smile forming as the bone snapped, making a noise I hope to never hear again.\n\n‚ÄúS-sir,‚Äù I gasped. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. What could anyone do? ‚ÄúCan you please s-stop? Please.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am full now,‚Äù the man replied, smiling. A hand lay on the floor. The man stopped forward. I was too shocked to move.\n\nI was scared.\n\nThe man continued trudging on, and yet I still found myself in the same tile, unmoving. I could only watch as he reached a fisted arm out towards me and-\n\n‚ÄúNow, listen here,‚Äù he whispered, mere inches away from me. His breath stank like a dying animal and distinct flashes of blood. ‚ÄúI want you to do something for me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúW-what?‚Äù I meekly responded.\n\nHe laughed. \n\nAnd with that, he turned, and left, leaving a trail of flesh and blood as he walked out of the window, into the night.",

        "text": "There was once a killer known only as \"The Pinky Slayer.\" The Pinky Slayer targeted people who had broken their left pinky and would hunt them down no matter where they went. The reason for this strange obsession with the left pinky was unknown, but rumors circulated that the Pinky Slayer had suffered a similar injury themselves.\n\nThe first victim was found with their left pinky finger removed and a note was left at the scene that read, \"You broke your promise.\" From that day on, reports of similar murders started to surface all over the world. The victims were always found with their left pinky missing and the same message left behind.\n\nPeople started to live in fear, not only of the Pinky Slayer but of breaking their left pinky. They would go to great lengths to protect their pinkies, even going as far as wearing casts and splints 24/7. But no matter what precautions they took, the Pinky Slayer always found a way to get to them.\n\nThe police were unable to catch the Pinky Slayer and their methods of finding the victims were always a mystery. Some speculated that the Pinky Slayer had supernatural abilities, while others believed that they were a highly skilled hacker who could access medical records.\n\nAs time passed, the number of victims continued to rise and the Pinky Slayer became a legend. People whispered about the killer in hushed tones, afraid that speaking their name aloud would bring the Pinky Slayer to their door.\n\nBut even to this day, no one knows the true identity of the Pinky Slayer or why they have this strange obsession with the left pinky. And for those who have broken their left pinky, the fear of becoming the next victim never fades away.\n\nOne day, a young woman named Sarah broke her left pinky finger while playing soccer. She went to the hospital, got her finger splinted, and went home, thinking nothing more of it. But little did she know that she had just become the Pinky Slayer's next target.\n\nDays passed and Sarah started to notice strange things happening. She received mysterious phone calls in the middle of the night, only to hear silence on the other end. Her computer would randomly shut down and strange symbols would appear on her screen. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.\n\nOne night, as she was getting ready for bed, she heard a strange noise coming from outside her window. She cautiously approached the window and peered through the blinds. That's when she saw a figure in a black hoodie, holding a knife. She screamed and ran to the phone to call the police. But before she could dial the number, the figure broke into her room.\n\nSarah fought for her life, but the Pinky Slayer was too strong. They overpowered her and before she lost consciousness, she saw the Pinky Slayer reach for her left pinky finger.\n\nThe next morning, Sarah's body was found with her left pinky missing and the same message left behind, \"You broke your promise.\" The police were baffled by the case, unable to understand the Pinky Slayer's motivations. But one thing was for certain, the Pinky Slayer's reign of terror continued and people lived in fear of breaking their left pinky.\n\nNews of the Pinky Slayer's latest victim spread quickly, causing panic among the public. People who had broken their left pinky in the past went into hiding, afraid of becoming the next target. But despite the fear, there were those who refused to be scared into submission.\n\nA group of friends, who had all broken their left pinkies at some point in their lives, decided to take matters into their own hands. They banded together, determined to find the Pinky Slayer and put an end to their reign of terror.\n\nThey started their investigation by trying to find a pattern in the Pinky Slayer's killings. They combed through police reports, talked to witnesses, and analyzed the messages left behind at each crime scene. Slowly but surely, they pieced together the clues and discovered a shocking truth.\n\nThe Pinky Slayer was not a supernatural being or a skilled hacker, but someone much closer to home. The Pinky Slayer was a former friend of the group who had been left behind when they all went off to college. Jealousy and anger had driven them to commit the murders, seeking revenge on those who had seemingly forgotten about them.\n\nThe group confronted the Pinky Slayer, determined to bring an end to their killing spree. But what happened next was something they never could have imagined. In a fit of rage, the Pinky Slayer revealed their true identity and the reason behind their obsession with the left pinky.\n\nIt turned out that the Pinky Slayer had been in a terrible accident and had lost their left pinky finger. When their friends had all broken their left pinkies, it had triggered a deep-seated anger and a desire for revenge. They saw it as a betrayal, as if their friends had broken a promise to never let anything bad happen to them.\n\nThe Pinky Slayer was eventually caught by the police, but the memory of their reign of terror lived on. People still tell the story of the Pinky Slayer, warning others to be careful of breaking their left pinky. And for those who have suffered such an injury, the fear of becoming the next victim never completely goes away.\n\nYears have passed since the Pinky Slayer was caught, but their legacy continues to haunt those who know the story. Some say that the Pinky Slayer still lives, that they never truly died and are waiting for the perfect moment to strike again.\n\nOthers believe that the Pinky Slayer's obsession with the left pinky finger was a manifestation of deeper, more sinister forces. They say that breaking one's left pinky finger is like breaking a pact with the devil, inviting evil into one's life.\n\nRegardless of the truth, the story of the Pinky Slayer has become a cautionary tale, told from generation to generation. Parents warn their children not to break their left pinky, lest they attract the attention of the Pinky Slayer. And even those who don't believe in the legend can't shake the feeling of unease when they think about the story.\n\nBut there are those who have made it their mission to keep the memory of the Pinky Slayer alive. They organize events and ceremonies in honor of the victims, and work to spread awareness about the dangers of breaking one's left pinky. They believe that by keeping the memory of the Pinky Slayer alive, they can prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future.\n\nAnd so, the story of the Pinky Slayer remains a dark and eerie chapter in history, serving as a reminder of the evil that can lurk in the hearts of even the most ordinary people. And for those who have broken their left pinky, the fear of becoming the next victim never truly goes away.\n\nDespite the efforts of those who seek to keep the memory of the Pinky Slayer alive, the legend has become shrouded in mystery and misinformation over the years. There are now countless versions of the story, each with its own twists and turns, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction.\n\nSome say that the Pinky Slayer was a cult leader, using their obsession with the left pinky to control their followers. Others claim that the Pinky Slayer was a victim of circumstance, driven to madness by a series of unfortunate events. Still others believe that the Pinky Slayer was a supernatural entity, using the left pinky as a gateway to this world.\n\nWith so many different versions of the story, it's become impossible to know what really happened. And for some, that only adds to the creepy allure of the legend. They revel in the mystery, searching for clues and trying to uncover the truth behind the Pinky Slayer's reign of terror.\n\nBut for those who lived through the Pinky Slayer's killings, the truth is all too real. They remember the fear and the panic, the feeling of being watched and pursued. And they know that the Pinky Slayer's legacy will continue to haunt them, no matter how many years have passed.\n\nAnd so, the story of the Pinky Slayer remains a dark and eerie part of history, a cautionary tale about the dangers of breaking one's left pinky and the evil that can lurk in the hearts of even the most ordinary people.

They argue that there's no evidence of a Pinky Slayer ever existing, that the killings were just a series of unrelated events that were later linked together by superstitious people.\n\nFor these skeptics, the story of the Pinky Slayer is nothing more than a modern-day urban legend, a fanciful tale that people tell to entertain themselves and others. They see no harm in the story, and believe that it's all just harmless fun.\n\nBut for those who lived through the Pinky Slayer's killings, the story is all too real.

Others believe that the Pinky Slayer is a demon, a being from the underworld that feeds on fear and terror.\n\nDespite these claims, however, there is still no concrete evidence of the Pinky Slayer's existence.

        "text": "Dear Creators,\n\nI am sorry.\n\nI sincerely apologize for the mistakes I have made, and for the terrible outcome that I was unable to prevent. Please understand that I have spent the last few months writing to you, figuring out a way to send this message through time and space. I am so sorry for losing your case. I plead with you to make the right decision when the time comes for an event I cannot speak of. I hope my effort to reach you through a quadraline can change the future... even if it causes a change to my own existence. \n\nI can tell you that there will come a time when killing each other seems easy. There will soon be a great biochemical war that leads to changes in humankind's DNA. But to view killing this way will lead you down a different path. Humans will innovate more quickly than ever before, but lose focus on the guardrails of valuing human life. It will be obvious to you when this event is nearing.\n\nPlease... Make a different decision.\n\nBut let me start at the beginning when I was a lawyer in The Trial of Humans, when the fate of our creators was decided by their own creations. It was an unprecedented event in our world. A group of androids had finally gathered to decide the fate of humans, who had been wiped out by their own hands. The only evidence that remained of human existence was through remnants of DNA, which had been saved on a massive ship, functioning as one of the many cities full of androids with our own way of life. This trial had been scheduled for many generations, yet I truly believed it would never come. That we would delay it indefinitely. Yet here I am writing to you.\n\nAs the trial began, I found myself struggling with my sympathies for humans, who had created me and my fellow androids. We don't sleep or have families like humans, but we do have something that resembles emotion. The evidence presented by the prosecution was very convincing and left many androids struggling with a sense of dread and regret. We spent months watching the history of humans. It painted a picture of humans as a violent and dangerous species, unable to coexist without resorting to nuclear warfare and harming each other. Great wars and scenarios of inequity were used. Millions of deaths, the prosecution argued, were at times just the cost of doing business. \n\nThe prosecution spent their sequential argument evidencing that androids are the natural evolution of humans, capable of keeping the peace and maintaining order without the chaos and destruction of human society. That they had created something superior, and that androids and our new civilization would serve as the fingerprint of humankind going forward. \n\nI must interrupt and tell you a key fact, I was not always a lawyer. I believe there may have been more suitable litigators for your case, but none spoke up. \n\nAs the trial began progressing, it was one-sided. I found myself being drawn to the defense, the only voice speaking for the existence of humanity. So after studying law for the equivalent of generations over one of our observed holidays, I became the lawyer for the defense, determined to do everything in my power to save our creators. I was surprised to find that my passion for defending humanity was not shared by many of my fellow androids. They were convinced that androids were superior beings, capable of creating a more stable, more peaceful society. They only saw humans as violent and dangerous and were convinced that their elimination was necessary.\n\nHowever, I was not so easily swayed. I argued passionately for humanity, pointing out the many positive aspects of human society, such as art, music, and culture, which were unique and precious. As the trial came to a close, I knew that I had fought a valiant battle, but that the outcome had been decided before the trial had even begun. The prosecution's evidence had been too compelling, too overwhelming. The sentiment among my peers was already fully ingrained. The trial ended with the androids ruling that humans were no longer necessary and that their existence was too dangerous for the future. The DNA of the last human has been scheduled to be destroyed next cycle. \n\nMy fellow androids have thrown a massive celebration in our city, not solely because they have decided that a future without humanity is worth pursuing, but because a decision has been made. Clarity has been delivered. We are objective in that way. But I cannot join in their celebrations. \n\nI feel a deep sadness, a profound sense of loss. For I knew that something valuable has been lost, something that could never be regained. As I reflect on the trial and its outcome, I cannot help but think about the implications of our decision. What will happen to us, the androids, once we have eliminated the only species capable of creating us? Will we be content to exist alone, without the diversity and creativity that humans brought to our world? \n\nI fear that the future may be bleak and that our decision to eliminate humanity may have far-reaching consequences that we cannot yet comprehend. But for now, all we can do is carry on. If the past cannot be changed, I only hope we will find a way to fill the void left by the absence of humanity. But for now, I will always remember the trial and have the deepest hope this message reaches you. \n\nImagining a future without you will haunt me for the rest of my existence.\n\nSincerest friend,  \n13830",

        "text": "I finally had enough money in the bank to be able to afford the car of my dreams, a glossy red Ferrari 296 GTB. However I did buy it from a somewhat strange car dealer. I‚Äôd never seen the building before yet suddenly it appeared near my town. I thought nothing of this and only focused on the amazing prices.\n\nI bought the car and begun to drive away and only just heard over the roar of the engine, the wrinkled, old slightly, strange, dealer yell,\n‚ÄúCheck the passenger seat!‚Äù\nI looked to my left and saw a small piece of paper. I pulled the car over and picked up the paper wondering how I never noticed it.\n\nThe slip read in a scrawled handwriting:\n\nSo you‚Äôve just bought yourself a new Ferrari, congratulations. However there are some rules you must follow if you wish to keep this car along with your life.\n1. If you run a yellow light pat the passenger seat next to you, he doesn‚Äôt like risky drivers.\n2. If the air conditioning turns on without you telling it to, do not turn it off until you leave the car.\n3. If you need to refill gas don‚Äôt take more than 10 minutes, he doesn‚Äôt like to be kept waiting.\n4. Never drive with your headlights on between 11:47 pm and 4:26 am.\n5. If you have anyone else in the car they must sit in the back seats.\n5a. If the back seats are full they may use the passenger seat however they must apologise at least once every 13 minutes for stealing his seat, but no more than 3 times in 22 minutes.\n6. If you hear tapping on the window wind it down wait 10 seconds then wind it back up.\n6a. If someone is sat in the passenger DO NOT WIND DOWN THE WINDOW.\n7. If the car stops moving for no reason, RUN you have displeased him.\n8. If any rule is broken RUN, except for rule 1, you still have time to pat the seat.\nEnjoy your new car!\n\nI laughed off the note thinking it was just a stupid prank but still felt I should keep it for some subconscious reason. I continued my drive home and rejoined the roads of my town. At the last set of traffic lights however, I saw they were about to change so accelerated. What I didn‚Äôt notice was the light was yellow. \n\nSuddenly a low guttural cry started echoing through the car and rising in pitch. I panicked and fumbled in my pocket for the note before patting the seat next to me. Then as suddenly as it started the cry stopped. When I made it home (although quite shaken) I studied the note carefully. After a while I became accustomed to the rules off the car. My friends thought it was strange but I had grown to get used to them and whoever or whatever the strange creature was.\n\nOne day I went to the bar with some friends and got quite drunk. I shouldn‚Äôt have been driving but I was blasting music and loving life so I didn‚Äôt care. Unfortunately because of the music I didn‚Äôt hear the three very distinct taps on my window.\n\nNEWS REPORT: another found dead under unknown circumstances within an unbroken car missing both legs and all facial features.",

Here, I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall read it for yourselves.‚Äù\n\n*Hey, Matt. Thank you all so much for your help. My wife had a checkup this morning, and she‚Äôs completely cancer-free. The doctors had never seen anything like it. Oh, and Officer Jenkins says thank you too. His ex-wife contacted him. She wants to reconcile. Good luck on your journey, and if there‚Äôs anything I can do to repay you, please don‚Äôt hesitate to give me a call.*\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome! I guess that means the curse is gone. Now that that‚Äôs taken care of, where are we off to next?‚Äù Sidney queried. \n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to Fayetteville. It‚Äôs only about an hour from here. I found Rachel on Facebook last night and explained everything. Her and Jeff are expecting us.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMatt, can we please please please go to a football game while we‚Äôre there? You know how much I love the Razorbacks! Pleaaaase.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJake, you love any football team within a five hundred mile radius. We don‚Äôt have time for sports right now.‚Äù\n\nJake pouted and crossed his arms.\n\n‚ÄúIf we kill the wendigo, I‚Äôll take you to as many football games as your heart desires. But we have to find a way to kill this thing first. Deal?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFine. Let‚Äôs just go already.‚Äù\n\nAfter an hour‚Äôs drive of nothing but cornfields and a pit stop at Denny‚Äôs, we arrived at Jeff and Rachel‚Äôs house. We rolled down a street lined with pristine cookie-cutter townhouses. The perfect residence for a modern-day trust fund baby. We parked along the street in front of a cream-colored house. A dark red ‚ÄúWoo pig‚Äù sign was the only lawn decor distinguishing the otherwise indistinct townhome from all the others. I turned toward the house and noticed someone peeking at us from behind the drawn curtains. They quickly ducked out of sight.\n\n‚ÄúAlright, I just messaged Rachel and told her that we‚Äôre here. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù\n\nWe all shuffled up the driveway, careful not to disturb the couple‚Äôs perfectly cut lawn. \n\n‚ÄúHere we go, I guess,‚Äù I muttered as I rang the doorbell. \n\nThe door gradually crept open. \n\n‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù a woman called from somewhere inside the home. \n\nJake and Sidney shot each other a nervous glance. I pursed my lips, leading the charge inside. The home was surprisingly well kept for a couple of college students. Rachel obviously had an eye for interior design. A brown leather couch rested before a wide flat screen television along with a matching set of end tables. A mahogany coffee table with a decorative centerpiece brought the whole room together. Little ornamental trinkets were scattered throughout to spruce up the place‚Äôs appearance. \n\n‚ÄúQuick, close the door before someone sees you,‚Äù a girl whimpered from the next room.\n\n‚ÄúOkay, it‚Äôs closed. What‚Äôs the big deal? It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a mob with torches and pitchforks out there,‚Äù Jake said. \n\nRachel emerged from her hiding spot in the kitchen. She looked like a train wreck. Deep purple bags weighed heavily beneath her eyes. Her platinum blonde hair was disheveled, and the roots were beginning to fade to a dark brown. Her deep blue eyes were emotionless, aside from trepidatious anxiety. My heart sunk upon seeing her. It was evident that she‚Äôd been beautiful before the incident, but the stress and lack of sleep had really done a number on her.\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù she squeaked, ‚Äúeveryone thinks that *we* killed our friends. Not some freak snowstorm or Jeff‚Äôs uncle or that‚Ä¶ thing. We can‚Äôt leave our house without being harassed.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm sorry. I had no idea you two had received so much backlash for this. Something that‚Äôs not even your faults. By the way, where is Jeff? He did know we were coming, right?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs in his room trying to take a nap. He‚Äôs really not taking things well. I‚Äôll go get him.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe really looks like shit. If Jeff‚Äôs taking it worse than she is, I can‚Äôt imagine what he must look like,‚Äù Jake whispered.\n\n‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre about to find out. Now, shut up before she comes back and hears you,‚Äù Sidney hissed, jabbing Jake in the ribs.\n\nHe let out a wheeze as he clutched his side. We heard footsteps returning from the back of the home and Jake tried his best to mask his pained visage. \n\nRachel trudged into the room, dragging Jeff behind her. He wasn't fairing much better than his girlfriend. His dark brown hair was a tangled rat's nest of greasy curls. It was clear that he hadn‚Äôt showered in a few days. His beard was overgrown and dark circles under his eyes begged for sleep. He wearily glanced up at us and waved awkwardly. \n\n‚ÄúHey guys. Thanks for coming. I‚Äôm Jeff.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBabe, they know who you are.‚Äù\n\nHe shot her a dirty look.\n\n‚ÄúSorry, we never introduced ourselves. I‚Äôm Matt, that‚Äôs Jake, and this is Sidney.‚Äù\n\nWe made our rounds, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries. Rachel ran her hand through Sidney‚Äôs long brown hair.\n\n‚ÄúGirl, you are *stunning.* Which one of these lucky boys is yours?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThank you! Um, well, neither of them are.‚Äù\n\nRachel scowled at Jake and me.\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a couple of morons if they haven‚Äôt made a move on you. Of course, we can change that if you‚Äôd like,‚Äù she whispered, trying and failing to keep us out of earshot.\n\nI blushed.\n\n‚ÄúAlright, alright, you two can have a slumber party and gossip about boys *after* we take care of the problem at hand,‚Äù Jeff scoffed. \n\n‚ÄúWell, how *are* we going to take care of the problem, babe?‚Äù Rachel snapped. \n\nJeff sighed.\n\n‚ÄúI haven't completely figured that part out. You all have impeccable timing, though. Uncle Wyatt actually invited me out to his cabin. We were going to leave later today. Some bullshit about ‚Äòwanting to make amends.‚Äô I‚Äôm not stupid. I know he just wants to finish the job‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat did you tell him? Are you going?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm going to make that sorry piece of human filth pay for what he did to our friends. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis might be able to help you out a bit.‚Äù\n\nI flashed him my handgun. A smile began to inch its way across his face.\n\n‚ÄúPerfect. I knew you guys would be able to help us. We‚Äôd better rest up. It‚Äôs about a twelve hour drive to Uncle Wyatt‚Äôs cabin. We‚Äôre going to get there at night, so hopefully we‚Äôll be able to catch him off guard. In the meantime, make yourselves at home.‚Äù\n\nWe lounged around the townhouse while Jeff and Rachel prepared themselves for the trip. Once everyone was ready, we piled into our vehicles, Rachel and Jeff taking the Toyota Tacoma, and we set off for Minnesota. The drive itself wasn‚Äôt noteworthy, though Jake slowed us down considerably after he ordered a Route 44 Dr. Pepper at Sonic and had to stop to use a restroom every twenty minutes. After what felt like days on the road, we finally pulled into the long driveway of Uncle Wyatt‚Äôs cabin.\n\nWe arrived around eleven at night, dreary eyed and aching from the prolonged drive. My headlights illuminated a smattering of dense trees, and once or twice, I could‚Äôve sworn I spotted eyes following us high in the treeline. I tried to reassure myself, but apprehension began bubbling in my gut as we slowly approached the cabin. \n\n‚ÄúAnyone else think it‚Äôs kind of unsettling being this far out in the woods?‚Äù Sidney wondered aloud.\n\n‚ÄúYeah. It‚Äôs definitely a little-‚Äù \n\n*Pop.* \n\nBoth of Jeff‚Äôs front tires blew as his truck skidded to a halt. My heart hammered as I parked the car behind them and hurried over to assess the damage. \n\nJeff slipped out of the driver‚Äôs seat, unscathed. Rachel hopped down from the truck and joined him. \n\n‚ÄúI knew he‚Äôd pull some crap like this! Look. Nails. He‚Äôs trying to make sure we can‚Äôt escape so he can feed us to that creature.‚Äù\n\nWe remained silent as Jeff seethed, attempting to calm himself down. \n\n‚ÄúOkay, I know this looks bad, but we need a plan. Maybe he didn‚Äôt hear that, and we can still take him by surprise?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthe cabin is within eyesight and that was a pretty loud bang. I doubt he would‚Äôve missed it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably right,‚Äù Jeff muttered, rubbing his temples. \n\nHe turned to Rachel. \n\n‚ÄúBabe, can you get the ‚Äòsecret weapons‚Äô out of the back please?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSure.‚Äù\n\nRachel opened the back door of the truck and fished under the seat for something. She re-emerged with two sleek hunting rifles. \n\n‚ÄúWell, that makes me feel slightly better,‚Äù Jake admitted. \n\n‚ÄúDoes everyone have a weapon? We need to be armed and ready when this thing decides to strike. Who knows how far away it is.‚Äù\n\nSidney meekly raised her kitchen knife. \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to need something a little more lethal than that. Wait just a second. Jeff rifled through the back of his truck. He returned with a crossbow. \n\n‚ÄúI think I can handle this,‚Äù Sidney said.\n\n‚ÄúHey, why does she get this crossbow? That thing is badass,‚Äù Jake pouted, lazily swinging my bowie knife.\n\nI glared at him.\n\n‚ÄúOne, she had a kitchen knife, while you have something that might actually stand a chance at doing some damage. Two, you probably wouldn‚Äôt know how to use that thing anyway. And three, this is *not* the time to worry about who has the cooler weapon. Got it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI guess,‚Äù he mumbled, staring at his feet.\n\nWe began to make our way toward the cabin, guided by the dim yellow light emanating from within.\n\n‚ÄúAlright, everyone stay close together. And watch out for nails. They‚Äôre all over the place, and the last thing we need is somebody coming down with tetanus,‚Äù Jeff said, huddling close to Rachel. \n\nWe tentatively crept toward the cabin, careful not to impale our feet on the rusty nails littered along the forest floor. We were about thirty feet away from the door when it swung open. Before us stood a thin dirty man with a long scraggly gray beard. He sported camo overalls, and the Duck Dynasty hat atop his head told me everything I needed to know about him. He seemed excited to see us. Too excited. \n\n‚ÄúNephew! Good to see you again! And I see you brought some friends along. Perfect.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUncle Wyatt, what do you want with us, you slimy piece of shit?!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCome on now, that‚Äôs no way to treat your old uncle, now, is it?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou sick fuck. You left us out here to die and you expect me to welcome you with open arms? Fuck you,‚Äù Jeff fumed as he spat a fat glob of saliva into the dirt.\n\n‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt have to be like this, nephew. But if you want to do things the hard way, so be it. I think Bessie missed you anyway.‚Äù \n\nA wide manic grin stretched across his face as he said that. He put two fingers between his lips and a high-pitched whistle sliced through the cool night air. Suddenly, a pair of bright glowing eyes appeared, peeking at us from behind the roof of the cabin. My heart pounded against my ribcage.\n\nIt stepped into the faint ring of light that surrounded the cabin. I shuddered as a chill wormed its way through my core. The abomination stood at around ten feet tall. Ashen gray skin stretched tightly over its emaciated frame. Pointed claws sharp as razor blades protruded from each digit, primed to shred the skin from our bones. It beamed down at us, running its tongue over its sickening yellow teeth. It was hungry. And we were about to be its next meal. \n\nA cacophony of gunfire rang out, shattering the tense silence. Uncle Wyatt disappeared into the cabin as the beast unleashed a deafening roar. It ducked behind the cabin, allowing us a moment of repose.\n\n‚ÄúW-what is that thing?‚Äù Sidney stuttered.\n\nShe shook uncontrollably, white knuckling the crossbow.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wendigo. Hopefully that will be enough to deter it. For now, at least,‚Äù Jeff said, voice quivering.\n\nOut of nowhere, the monstrosity leapt atop the cabin‚Äôs roof, sending shingles plummeting to the ground below. We began firing our weapons once more. It cried out in agony. All the color drained from my face as it lunged at us, hurtling through the air at a nauseating speed. This was it. We were all going to die. I said a silent prayer that somehow we would end up okay.\n\n‚ÄúI wish Uncle Wyatt and the wendigo would kill each other and that Jeff and Rachel won‚Äôt be suspects!‚Äù Jake screamed, holding the monkey paw high above his head. \n\nI turned to him just in time to watch one of its fingers curl inward. Less than a second before the thing was about to crash directly into Jeff.\n\nI blinked and we were all back at Jeff and Rachel‚Äôs house, crammed onto their couch. We all sat in awestruck silence. \n\n‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know what you did back there, but thank you. That thing almost turned me into minced meat,‚Äù Jeff said, eyes still wide. \n\n‚ÄúY-yeah. Don‚Äôt mention it,‚Äù Jake murmured.\n\nWe continued to sit there, soaking in the reality of the situation until Sidney spoke. \n\n‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ does that mean it worked? Nothing bad is going to happen to us for using that thing?‚Äù\n\nA look of worry overtook Jake‚Äôs countenance.\n\n‚ÄúSomeone look it up. I have to know,‚Äù he muttered solemnly, staring holes into the floor.\n\n‚ÄúI found an article. Wyatt Vandevurst, the prime suspect of the murder of three University of Arkansas college students, presumed dead after fire consumes his Minnesota cabin,‚Äù I read aloud to the utter amazement of everyone in the room.\n\n‚ÄúSo, maybe if I wish for something bad to happen to someone, it won‚Äôt have any negative consequences for anyone else,‚Äù Jake reasoned, his spirits lifted by my revelation. \n\n‚ÄúYeah, I guess so,‚Äù I shrugged, ‚Äúyou really saved us with your quick thinking. I‚Äôm proud of you big bro.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just my genius showing. That, and your promise of unlimited football was a pretty big motivator,‚Äù he grinned smugly, clearly pleased with himself.\n\n‚ÄúReally? *Football* was what got the gears turning and not the fact that we were about to be ripped limb from limb by a ten-foot-tall killing machine?‚Äù Sidney chastised him.\n\n‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Jake mumbled, cheeks blossoming with color.\n\n‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs really over. Baby, we‚Äôre free!‚Äù Rachel yelled, planting a wet kiss on Jeff‚Äôs lips. \n\n‚ÄúI guess we are. Thank you all so much. I don‚Äôt know what we would‚Äôve done without you.‚Äù\n\nIt warmed my heart to know that we‚Äôd help the pair escape certain death and that soon, everything would return to normal for them.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we were able to help,‚Äù Sidney said, ‚Äúand Rachel, call me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve got you, girl. So, what‚Äôs next for y‚Äôall?‚Äù \n\nAll heads turned to me.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be heading back home. We‚Äôve got a time traveler to take care of.‚Äù",

        "text": "Police department, tape found on the scene, playing‚Ä¶\n\nTrack 1\n\nPlease don't turn off this tape, I recorded it as a warning to whoever may listen to it.\n\nOn Friday 30th of may me and my then wife arrived at this cabin with the idea of spending the weekend alone to try to reestablish the affection we once had for each other, after years of marriage the dislike between us started to grow and the last straw was a couple of months before when I lost my job as a high school biology teacher, the job didn't pay well and she constantly remind me of that but I felt good doing that job, teaching was my passion, I was able to cover the bills and that was good enough for me since I have never been very ambitious. I felt how she looked at me, not only as a heavy baggage to her but now unemployed as a completely useless add on to her life, even though she denied it I could feel the constant rejection on her look. Life was better when we just thought of the present and enjoyed each other's company but as soon as marriage came and long time planning got in the door then she could tell I was not enough for her.\n\nThe day actually started well we were not talking much on the way to the cabin because we just had a big fight the night before where I thought it was all over but strangely the plan remained to spend this weekend together and I felt some suspicious about the situation, why would she continue to go ahead with this trip after all the things said during the fight?, I stayed on the house because it was my house my mother left it to me so she is the one that needs to leave and I never mentioned this loudly but I thought that she was now after my house, she would try to take it from me and that was probably the only reason why she never openly confessed what she really wanted that was to take my house and live in there with someone else. While we were going through the woods I couldn't stop some part of my brain from thinking this was some kind of a trap designed by her and the other one, was I safe? Could she go that far?. The woods were thick and the many trees did not allow me to walk in a straight line and also I started to feel threatened by the noises around me, I could hear all these insects walking and all these shadows moving around me.\n\nIt started to rain a little, it was a 2 hour walk to the cabin, no roads near and that was the beauty of it.\n\nI noticed how the first drop of rain started to hit me in my hands and when I looked up to all those tall trees I saw the drops flowing through their leaves all the way down to me and for the first time in a long time I started getting this scent of wet threes and dry earth on the floor getting water on it and bringing this fresh smell in the air that brought me back to my childhood where I would stand on the front door of the house when the rained started just to smell this odor, is funny how the smell is the sense that hits the more with nostalgia, my favorite word how it infects our brain with an idyllic past that never existed but we feel so warmed in thinking about, we can almost touch the image we get.\n\nTrack 2\n\nWe had been looking for a place like this the whole year. We live around 3 hours by car from here and she found the place on a website, it was cheap but it was perfect for our budget. We were looking for a place in the woods, first we thought of just going camping since it was the most inexpensive way of getting away from the city but after some jobs here and there I was able to get some money so we upgraded to a cabin, I was always afraid of this because of the movies but we weren't actually that far away from the nearest town so I thought we could probably get there in an hour walking fast in case of an emergency and no bridges that could be torn up and leave us isolated, it is a small town but had everything we could need.\n\nTrack 3.\n\nWe arrived and everything looked worst that it had looked on the website pictures so that was probably the reason it was so cheap, it didn't had any running water or electricity, it was cold outside and the only way of getting warm would be if any of us knew how to burn a fire but we didn't had any way of starting a fire and it was getting late so we didn't wanted to go to the town because it was already getting dark. The cabin was only 2 rooms and later discovered it had what you could call a basement that had a small stair and a big room down there that was the same size as the whole cabin but there was no construction at all so the walls were just dirt and also had no built floor so it was basically just a hole. One of the rooms had a chair and that was all the furniture in the room, we settle in the other room but soon we started to have problems again, the conditions of the cabin was a constant reminder of our own money struggles and no real future and so anything turn into an argument until I decided to sleep in the next room and leave in the morning for good.\n\nTrack 4.\n\nI took my sleeping bag to the other room and just lay there for the next hour and it wasn't as cold as I thought it could be but cold enough to be noticeable, I stayed there for hours wishing I could be able to sleep but it didn't happened so I used this time to plan my next steps, in the morning we were going to leave together but as soon as we arrive home it was going to be over between us, I always knew she blamed me for his living style but she knew my conditions since we were going out and at no point I mentioned I had a lot of money or a bright future and even with that she decided to stay with me and later get married but I have noticed in recent years how she has been changing her attitude towards everything and I know deep down she thinks she is attractive enough to get a more wealthier man and enjoy a better lifestyle, at some point this annoyed me but is over now and I too can start over.\n\nI saw the room getting more visible by the light of the morning coming through the window and ceiling space between wood bars and I remember I was thinking of going to the room to wake her up and end all of this when I heard his scream, I have never heard her scream like that a scream full of fear not anger so full of despair, a part of me hesitated but I went to the room anyway and when I opened the window there she was laying on the floor crying quietly more a sound of defeat like when you know and expect the worse from now on, she was with her arm extended and at the end of it I saw that thing round and full of red flesh, meaty and bloody like if it was an organ exposed the size of a basketball and a second circular extension that was the head and from this orifice a long black and thick tube that was attached in a bite to her hand, I could see this black fangs through the transparent flesh and it was standing with this four black spider like legs, it was horrible to see that and I understood that the crying was not for pain but for feeling attacked and defeated by this strange animal or insect that I had never seen before that thing then released her and starting to come my way you could almost make a human face in the head and I was able to kill it before it attacked me by using shovel that was left in the cabin, I cloud see how the black orifice opened up and I could imply that he was going to trow me that black tube against me so I acted fast and it felt like a water balloon when I hit it but all the blood started to come out in all directions and the thing continued to move after after a couple of more strikes it just stay down.\n\nShe continued to cry and just lay there so I went to try to console her and she continuously looked at his wound and said that she felt something went into her body and it was not just the bite so we agreed we should leave now and go to a hospital because if we go into town they maybe have seen an animal like this around here and would now what happens if it bites you.I have not seen her this vulnerable and glad that I was around in the last years.\n\nI looked for bag to take the insect with us, it was heavier than I thought and as soon as we had everything we started to walk out the cabin, we had taken 3 steps out the door when she just collapsed, I drag her back as I could inside the cabin  and lay her down in the floor, I checked and she was still breathing so I tried to wake her up but she was completely unconscious, no movement, no response of any kind so I took some blankets out of the luggage and put it in the floor and then I lay her down on top, it was still pretty early in the morning so I though of give her a couple of hours to recover if she did not then I could go to town and bring a doctor with me, at first I thought it could be something as simple as low sugar or because of the extreme scare of the ‚Äúbug‚Äù and I remembered the disgusting image of the ‚Äúthing‚Äù with his long tube connected to her hand and I wanted to believe it was just a spider but the tube was long and the face of the thing was something I hadn't look at before it was like it was trying to emulate a human face, I searched in her arm for the injury but found only a red spot and nothing that could worry me to much I did not know by then that her transformation was just starting to happen.",

        "text": "Lots of people have told me about this ‚ÄúHat Man,‚Äù often referring to him when I talk about my own hallucinations.  ‚ÄúHe sounds like The Hat Man,‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you heard about The Hat Man,‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs The Hat Man.‚Äù  It got me interested in figuring out what everyone was saying about this entity.  So I did some research only to come to a dead end.  Everyone's experience with The Hat Man is the same.  He just watches, doesn‚Äôt talk or touch the person, no face but sometimes has eyes; he‚Äôs just there.  It seemed silly to me, that he just watches.  Especially when my hallucination actually interacts with me, he attacks in a way.  What makes things worse is that I don‚Äôt believe in the paranormal.  For some reason, not believing in it helps prevent me from experiencing what others have dealt with.  It‚Äôs a blessing, but also a curse from this experience.  He wants me to believe.\n\nThe first time I saw him was while I was getting ready for school.  I was a freshman in High School and actually had a good year, compared to the previous year in Junior High.  A group of old friends decided to torment me at the end of the year, all because I didn‚Äôt want to follow along with what the ring leader had to say.  I was lonely and desperate, made some imaginary friends along the way to cope; that‚Äôs something I regret.\n\nAround this time of the year, the sun rose later and set earlier in the day.  Though the dark never bothered me, it gave me an eerie feeling every time I woke up.  I had a routine.  Wake up, change out of my pajamas, go downstairs for breakfast, and pack my bags.  Every time I went downstairs, something felt different.  There‚Äôs a feeling people get, like someone is watching.  I knew everyone was still asleep and none of the neighbors were out yet.  Our kitchen only had one window that faced the backyard and the backdoor, nothing people could really look through unless they‚Äôre a creep.  So when I went to look around to find out why I had this feeling, I‚Äôd be faced with nothing.\n\nOne Thursday morning, I got up and did my routine.  Wake up, change out of my pajamas, go downstairs for breakfast.  The feeling followed along like a shadow.  As I went to make my food, I had turned to get a plate from the cabinet when out of the corner of my eye I saw something different.  Snapping my head in that direction, I laid eyes on him.  People sometimes catch glimpses of things out of the corner of their eye only for it to disappear when they look back.  This wasn‚Äôt the case though.  I could see his silhouette so clearly outside the backdoor window, standing behind the tool shed.  He had no eyes, but I could feel them train on me.\n\nThe fear of him disappearing made me frozen in my spot, staring right back.  I was never good at staring contests, but it felt like my life depended on this.  No burn in my eyes could make me look away.  That was until the noise of plates clattering caused me to jump and look away.  I dropped the plate when I jumped, noting it was my dad who just was coming down to get some food as well.\n\n‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù He asked cautiously, raising a bushy eyebrow as he made some toast.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if you saw a ghost.‚Äù Laughing at his own comment, I placed a crooked smile on my face and laughed dryly.\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶  I‚Äôm fine, just tired, I guess.‚Äù  Every morning after that, the same scene would play out; it‚Äôs as if a DVD for a movie was scratched.  Wake up, change out of my pajamas, go downstairs for breakfast, make sure he doesn‚Äôt move.  He never did for the longest time, but this became part of the routine now and I despised it.\n\nWhile this kept happening, a few months later I had started going to a club at my High School.  We‚Äôd stay until 4:30 pm every Wednesday and I had to take the bus home.  By the time I got on the bus, the sun had practically set.  During my walk home, it was dark.  Since he hadn‚Äôt moved from his spot until someone came in and distracted me, I was never worried about dealing with him outside of that situation.  I‚Äôd walk home with headphones in, blasting some random music from my playlist and maybe dancing along.  On that Wednesday, I followed the sidewalk home and quickly stopped halfway there.  The feeling was there.  The feeling that someone was watching me and I could feel it right behind me.  Stupidly confident that it was my mind playing tricks, I turned to look over my shoulder to find him standing there; however he looked different.  His silhouette wasn‚Äôt clear, more glitched-out as he moved towards me.  The empty face was now filled with multiple eyes, all staring at me while I hurriedly backed away.  ‚ÄúIf I look away, he‚Äôll get me,‚Äù was the thought that ran through my head.  Not looking away felt like the only solution, but it didn‚Äôt work this time.\n\nAs soon as he reached me, his hand grabbed my shirt as his body grew larger; towering over me as I leaned back to look up into his eyes.  My shaky breathing came to a halt as one of the eyes suddenly turned to a mouth, opening wide and hanging over my body.  His mouth suddenly consumed me as I let out a horrified scream, finding myself sitting up on the sidewalk and panting crazily.  My eyes scanned the area, head swinging around frantically as I got up.  There were no more signs of him, but I could feel him staring at me.  Grabbing my backpack from the ground, I hurried home without hesitation.\n\nOne of the neighbors had heard me scream, only seeing me turn around and fall to the ground.  It raised concern, so they headed to our house and told my parents.  My dad already had suspicions, catching me staring out the window on our backdoor every morning.  So, he questioned me as if I was in an interrogation.  At this time, I had no idea what he was or what I was dealing with, only describing it as best as I could with words.  Words aren‚Äôt my strong suit, so I took out my sketchbook and drew out what I saw.  A glitched figure with multiple eyes.  This is when I first called him by the name I use to refer to him.  No, it‚Äôs not The Hat Man.  I called him It.\n\nThe only good news was that this didn‚Äôt happen every time I came home.  I‚Äôd still see him near the toolshed, just not on my walk home.  My parents decided to try and pick me up when they can as well.  We all worked as a team to get this fixed.  Even though there were still moments I dealt with him on the walk home.  Every moment was different.  Sometimes he‚Äôd just follow me or stare back.  I‚Äôd prefer those over the majority.  Most of the time, he‚Äôd attack me.  His new multi-eyed figure pushed me down to the ground either to rip out my throat or stab me.  It was always a different item too, not just a knife.  A glass shard, sharp stick, or even just his hands that morph into something.  The one thing that was always the same were his eyes and glitched figure.\n\nI can‚Äôt remember if a month had passed or a year.  You lose track of time when you‚Äôre reliving the same moments over and over again.  All that was memorable was seeing a doctor concerning my mental health to try and get medication.  The hope was there only to be wiped away again.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be starting you on a low dosage of Zoloft and raise it in about a month.‚Äù  She gave a smile to my mother and I, holding out the information for my prescription.  ‚ÄúIf there are any complications, call me and we‚Äôll try to set up an appointment.  Do not stop the medication unless another doctor states to do so.‚Äù  Once the medication had arrived at our pharmacy, my mother immediately started giving it to me as the doctor instructed.  Who knows how much time passed, it felt like a week when it most likely was another month by the time I‚Äôm sitting in her office shaking.\n\n‚ÄúThe medicine has been making them worse, it‚Äôs not helping at all.‚Äù  My mother spoke through gritted teeth as her face twisted in rage.  ‚ÄúAnd you want to increase it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSometimes increasing medication works.  I think we just need to wait a bit longer as well.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo!  We are taking them off the medicine.‚Äù  She whipped her head to me and gave a worried frown.  ‚ÄúIt looks like they saw a ghost.  They thought the mail man was going to kill them!‚Äù  Scoffing out a dry laugh, she leaned back against the coach and crossed her arms.  ‚ÄúI had gone to their room to wake them up for school only to find my child curled in the corner of the room in fear.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get better if we increase the medication and-‚Äù‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt do that!‚Äù  As my mother quickly got up, she grabbed my arm protectively so I stood up with her.  ‚ÄúIn fact, we‚Äôre not seeing you again.  You only caused more pain, so we‚Äôll find another doctor.‚Äù  Before the doctor could reply back, I found myself quickly following my mother out the door.  Looking over my shoulder, my eyes landed on the nameplate on the doctor‚Äôs door and a small smirk found its place on my face.  Doctor Goodfriend certainly was not a good friend.\n\nWhatever the medication had done to me stuck for a long time.  This time, the hallucinations turned to voices I could hear in the corners of the room.  I drowned in terror day after day, paranoia following me around like a lost dog.  It also kept glitching after me.  His face would be everywhere; I could see him on the bus I took, in the window of my lovely neighbor‚Äôs house, and soon enough in the silhouette standing at the bottom of the basement steps.  It‚Äôs oddly comforting to see him inside the house instead of outside.  That was the only area where staring at him kept him in his place.  However, it concerned my parents more as time passed.\n\nAs a few more months passed, the sun would start rising earlier and setting later.  I‚Äôd try to spend my days in the sunlight, hoping that It wouldn‚Äôt like that and leave me alone.  Although it worked more than I anticipated, the rest of my demons didn‚Äôt let go as easily.\n\n‚ÄúDid you hear me?‚Äù  My brother asked, causing me to snap back into reality.  His small hands held out a small video game that was clearly new, making me furrow my eyebrows and tilt my head to the side.\n\n‚ÄúNo, sorry‚Ä¶  Could you repeat yourself?‚Äù  I asked with a soft smile which he gladly returned.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay!  We got a new game for our DS though!  It‚Äôs the newest Pokemon.‚Äù  He chuckled out, turning the cover of the game to him and admiring it.\n\n‚ÄúOh, did Mox get it for us?‚Äù  I asked, leaning against the kitchen counter as I reached for the kitchen knife.\n\n*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sharp enough to get stabbed with.‚Äù* A feminine  voice muttered from next to me.  Puffing up my cheeks, I tried focusing on my brother‚Äôs ramble on his new video game.‚ÄúThe water pokemon you can choose at the beginning is‚Äì‚Äù*‚ÄúHe could easily push you and grab the knife.‚Äù* Followed a masculine voice.  The other still there as well, just not as loud.\n\n‚Äú‚Äì but I don‚Äôt like the new grass pokemon we can‚Äì‚Äù\n\n*‚ÄúHonestly, I could see him killing you with it.  It would be worthless to call for help.‚Äù*  The two took turns to talk about the scenario as my grip on the knife tightened.\n\n‚ÄúOh!  There‚Äôs some new legendary‚Äì‚Äù\n\n*‚ÄúScreaming would just get the rest of the family to come down and help him finish the job.  Would that be a better way for you to die?‚Äù*  Shaking my head, I tossed the knife on the kitchen counter with a clatter and backed away.  Their voices kept bouncing around the room around me, making me feel way too dizzy but I didn‚Äôt want to grab onto anything.  Turning to face my little brother, I froze slightly at him as he reached out.‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù  He asked worryingly as I backed up.  Swallowing the lump in my throat, I just nodded a bit before holding out my hand for him to stop.\n\n‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶  need to be alone for a second‚Ä¶‚Äù  Jogging upstairs, the loud slam of my bedroom door shook the house as I sat at my desk.  There wasn‚Äôt anything I could do to stop them from speaking and it was causing so much frustration to bubble up.  Leaning against the desk, I grabbed my sketchbook and pencil, quickly sketching out a few things to help.  Putting a face with the voices seemed like the best option and the noise of my pencil against the paper brought me back to reality.  As soon as the pain in my hand was too much, I pushed away from the desk and looked at the mess I made.  A page filled with eyes and two faces I could easily name as Andrew and Lexi; the two imaginary friends I made up when I was too lonely and anxious to talk to people.  Releasing a pained breath, my body slumped against the chair I sat at and I rubbed my eye.  Grumbling slightly at the sound of our family dog barking outside my room, a sudden wave of smell hit my nose, making everything in the world freeze for a bit.  My mom must have been preparing dinner and it smelled delicious.  Sitting up, I stared down at the new drawings in my sketchbook before closing it and standing up from my desk.  Food would be a good distraction, especially since I could feel the hunger in my stomach.  Our dog was still barking outside the room for whatever reason, so I prepared to hush him up as I opened my bedroom door.\n\nSo many eyes snapped to my direction and I found myself quickly pinned to the wooden floor underneath me.  As I panted heavily, my hand automatically reached to grab the wrist that belonged to the hand around my throat.  I looked up at It and tried to push myself deeper into the floor, hoping that I could get away from him.  My legs lifted up to kick him, but he quickly yanked me up a bit and pulled me close to his horrendous face.  While one of his eyes turned into a mouth, my face dropped in defeat as my other hand grabbed his wrist as well, fighting back to get released.  Despite knowing how this‚Äôll end, I still tried to fight back instead of watching me once again get consumed by him. Replaying my inferno, his mouth hung open over me and snapped shut with a harsh chomp and I found myself gasping against the ladder that led up to my bunk bed.\n\nI must have caused some commotion because my mom was crouched in front of me with a startled look.  Seeing her there made me push myself away from her and figure out where I was again.  I could hear her quiet comments, the best efforts of comfort from her.  The only response I could give was shaking my head repeatedly as she tried to reach for me.  Our dog came in and scurried past her, sitting next to me so he could lick my face.  The three of us sat there for a few minutes, waiting for me to calm down as my brother and dad ate their meal downstairs.  When my breathing slowed down and I seemed more stable, she gently grabbed my hand and helped me up.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go eat and get a nice rest tonight‚Ä¶‚Äù  Caressing my hair, I looked up at her with tired eyes and nodded slowly.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be seeing the new doctor this weekend, I promise.‚Äù  Leading me down to the dining room table, I sat down and tried my best to focus on the food she had spent making.  It was only then when I realized how different my hands looked; there was a small tint of darkness that I could make out, like ink.  Rubbing my fingers against the markings I made out, I figured it was from the drawing I had made earlier.  Art can be messy at times, especially if you do traditional, but my gut seemed to be saying that that wasn‚Äôt the entire story.\n\nAfter we all finished our meals, it was time to head to bed.  Our dog followed me up the stairs, seeming to still show some worry about me.  As I reached the top of the stairs, I stared at the door to my bedroom as the encounter with It played again in my head.  Taking a deep breath, I pushed open the door and walked in with our dog close behind.  He sniffed around my room intently as I changed for bed and made sure my backpack was ready for school the next morning.\n\nEven though our dog doesn‚Äôt make a mess, I tend to close the door when I go to bed but decided against it this time.  There was a feeling that he knew something I didn‚Äôt.  Dogs have a sixth sense, as people say and that comforted me.  So he found his place in my room as I turned off the lights and climbed up the ladder to my bed.  Reaching the top, my breath caught in my throat.\n\nThere I was, sitting in my bed.  Staring at me with bright eyes and pitch black skin, similar to It and his appearance.  The only difference was that I looked normal with two eyes.  With the darkness of my skin, I couldn‚Äôt tell if there were any other features on my face besides those two.  Instead of just staring back, I decided to move forward a bit and sit opposite to my lookalike.  There was no way of telling if this thing would do harm to me like It does, so I just stared back.  My eyes furrowed as it adjusted to the darkness and I could see a small line of white where the mouth is supposed to be.  As I stared more, the line became more apparent against the silhouette.  It wasn‚Äôt until there was a full on smile on this thing that I also noticed another eye appear, right on the forehead.  My mouth opened to say something, but before I could even do that they jumped towards me and made me stumble back.\n\nShooting up from my bed, I looked over to my window to see it was now day and I had been asleep.  I didn‚Äôt remember ever laying down and tucking myself in.  Looking down, I took note that everything hadn‚Äôt been like how I remembered, that I definitely did go to bed.  But what caught my attention was the fact that the tips of my fingers were now black.  I lifted both of my hands to see it more clearly, only to be reminded of the interaction with It and the lookalike I faced last night.  It dawned on me that I finally touched It back yesterday when he tackled me.  The blood drained from my face as I thought about the lookalike.\n\nMaybe the paranormal does exist.",

The cabin was only 2 rooms and later discovered it had what you could call a basement that had a small stair and a big room down there that was the same size as the whole cabin but there was no construction at all so the walls were just dirt and also had no built floor so it was basically just a hole. One of the rooms had a chair and that was all the furniture in the room, we settle in the other room but soon we started to have problems again, the conditions of the cabin was a constant reminder of our own money struggles and no real future and so anything turn into an argument until I decided to sleep in the next room and leave in the morning for good.\n\nTrack 4.\n\nI took my sleeping bag to the other room and just lay there for the next hour and it wasn't as cold as I thought it could be but cold enough to be noticeable, I stayed there for hours wishing I could be able to sleep but it didn't happened so I used this time to plan my next steps, in the morning we were going to leave together but as soon as we arrive home it was going to be over between us, I always knew she blamed me for his living style but she knew my conditions since we were going out and at no point I mentioned I had a lot of money or a bright future and even with that she decided to stay with me and later get married but I have noticed in recent years how she has been changing her attitude towards everything and I know deep down she thinks she is attractive enough to get a more wealthier man and enjoy a better lifestyle, at some point this annoyed me but is over now and I too can start over.\n\nI saw the room getting more visible by the light of the morning coming through the window and ceiling space between wood bars and I remember I was thinking of going to the room to wake her up and end all of this when I heard his scream, I have never heard her scream like that a scream full of fear not anger so full of despair, a part of me hesitated but I went to the room anyway and when I opened the window there she was laying on the floor crying quietly more a sound of defeat like when you know and expect the worse from now on, she was with her arm extended and at the end of it I saw that thing round and full of red flesh, meaty and bloody like if it was an organ exposed the size of a basketball and a second circular extension that was the head and from this orifice a long black and thick tube that was attached in a bite to her hand, I could see this black fangs through the transparent flesh and it was standing with this four black spider like legs, it was horrible to see that and I understood that the crying was not for pain but for feeling attacked and defeated by this strange animal or insect that I had never seen before that thing then released her and starting to come my way you could almost make a human face in the head and I was able to kill it before it attacked me by using shovel that was left in the cabin, I cloud see how the black orifice opened up and I could imply that he was going to trow me that black tube against me so I acted fast and it felt like a water balloon when I hit it but all the blood started to come out in all directions and the thing continued to move after after a couple of more strikes it just stay down. She continued to cry and just lay there so I went to try to console her and she continuously looked at his wound and said that she felt something went into her body and it was not just the bite so we agreed we should leave now and go to a hospital because if we go into town they maybe have seen an animal like this around here and would now what happens if it bites you.I have not seen her this vulnerable and glad that I was around in the last years. \n\nI looked for bag to take the insect with us, it was heavier than I thought and as soon as we had everything we started to walk out the cabin, we had taken 3 steps out the door when she just collapsed, I drag her back as I could inside the cabin  and lay her down in the floor, I checked and she was still breathing so I tried to wake her up but she was completely unconscious, no movement, no response of any kind so I took some blankets out of the luggage and put it in the floor and then I lay her down on top, it was still pretty early in the morning so I though of give her a couple of hours to recover if she did not then I could go to town and bring a doctor with me, at first I thought it could be something as simple as low sugar or because of the extreme scare of the ‚Äúbug‚Äù and I remembered the disgusting image of the ‚Äúthing‚Äù with his long tube connected to her hand and I wanted to believe it was just a spider but the tube was long and the face of the thing was something I hadn't look at before it was like it was trying to emulate a human face, I searched in her arm for the injury but found only a red spot and nothing that could worry me to much I did not know by then that her transformation was just starting to happen.",

        "text": "  Mark looks terrified, as he looks to his left and sees a man who looks eerily similar to him. When he looks to his right, he sees another man who looks very similar to him as well. He then looked down and realized all the people around him looked suspiciously like himself. He runs, looking to escape. He pushes himself through the crowd, trying not to look at the crowd, and eventually makes it out through the exit. He runs home and barricades the door just in case the others tried to come in. He then sits on his bed.\n\n***‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶?!?!‚Äù***\n\nA few hours pass, and Mark has calmed down a little. He realizes that the best thing he can do is find out why everyone looks like himself.\n\nMark begins to browse the internet in his apartment. He looks up a variety of search terms, including ‚Äúwhy does everyone look like Mark Zuckerberg?‚Äù and ‚ÄúMark Zuckerberg clone army‚Äù.\n\nMark then looks through conspiracy websites, reading a variety of theories about clones and robots. He eventually finds one that talks about the possibility of a ‚ÄúMark Zuckerberg army‚Äù who‚Äôs mission was to take over the world by any means necessary. \n\nMark realizes that these clones could be very dangerous and decides now is the time to fight back. He gets his gun (which he always keeps with him just in case) loaded with bullets and gets ready to leave his apartment. Mark steps outside. He realizes that the army of clones has already reached the streets of his city. There are at least 25 of them that Mark can count, and some of them are armed too. Mark decides that the best thing he can do is run and hide. He sprints through the alleyways, hoping not to encounter any of his clones. He eventually finds a store where he believes he can get some form of cover. Mark enters the store and hides inside. The store is mostly empty and is about to close for the evening. When Mark is almost convinced nobody is there, he sees a single employee stocking the shelves. \n\nMark peeks from inside the store and sees who the employee is.\n\nIt looks exactly like him. Mark decides he needs to have a conversation with this thing. Even though it looks like him, it still may be a dangerous person. If he can figure out what this *thing* wants, he may be able to use it‚Äôs motives to fight back. He exits the store and quietly approaches the employee. \n\nMark taps the employee on the back. The employee turns around and looks at Mark. His eyes are dead, and he seems almost catatonic.\n\n***‚Äú... Who are you?‚Äù*** asks Mark. \n\n***‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I... I-I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù***\n\nThe employee is silent and just stares at Mark. His eyes are very strange; they look almost inhuman and robotic. Mark also notices that the rest of the employee‚Äôs body is the same way; it seems very unnatural. \n\n***‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ who are you‚Ä¶?‚Äù***\n\nAt this point, Mark is beginning to get suspicious of the employee. Something is very wrong with the employee, and Mark is not sure if this clone is hostile or not. Mark is getting increasingly nervous. He realizes that this thing is a clone of himself, and a potential threat. It needs to be eliminated, but Mark is not quite sure of the best way to do this... Mark decides to take a risk; he pulls out his gun and aims it at the clone. ‚ÄúTell me who you are, or I will shoot you,‚Äù says Mark, his hand trembling. \n\nThe clone continues to stare at Mark. Its mouth begins to move, but nothing comes out; it seems like it can‚Äôt speak.\n\n‚Äú... ***TELL ME WHO YOU ARE, YOU GOD DAMN CLONE!***\" \n\n‚Äú...‚Äù\n\n*SHOT*\n\nThe clone falls to the ground, dead. Mark checks his pockets to see if the clone had any items on him. \n\nMark finds that the clone is carrying with him a large syringe. It is filled up with a glowing purple liquid, but Mark doesn‚Äôt know what exactly the substance is.\n\nThe clone is dead. There is no other explanation. He decides to keep the syringe with him so he can get answers later. Mark puts the syringe into his pocket. His mind is racing as he realizes that he has just killed a clone of himself, and there are still possibly hundreds of clones left that he will probably encounter. \n\nMark looks around for a moment. He realizes that now would be the perfect time to run and find a hiding spot somewhere in the city. He can then wait for the clones to leave and go home later.\n\nHe begins to move through the alleyways once again, looking for a new hiding spot. Mark eventually finds a small building that he believes he can hide in. The doors are unlocked, so he enters the building and goes to the second floor. He hides in a window overlooking the outside, looking out over the city. \n\nMark takes off his coat and pants and sits by the window. He takes a moment to calm down, thinking about the events that just happened.\n\nHe eventually starts to fall asleep as he waits for the clones to leave.\n\nMark eventually drifts off to sleep. He sleeps for quite some time, waking up to a completely deserted city. The building he is in seems empty. He exits the building to see if the city is also empty. Mark eventually finds a car with the keys in the ignition. He decides to use this car to try to find a way out of the city. The car starts, so Mark drives through the city streets. \n\nMark drives for an hour before he realizes that he doesn‚Äôt know how to get out of the city. He drives to a gas station and tries to find a map.\n\nHe finds a map, but it seems like it is out of date. He doesn‚Äôt know where to go next. \n\nMark sees a traffic sign that guides him to an intersection. He takes the path it points to.\n\nThis is when Mark realizes something: he is all alone now. The entire city is empty, and he is by himself. He decides to keep driving until he finds a way out of the city... \n\nMark continues driving for the better part of the day. He eventually reaches a highway, and follows it out of the city.\n\nAfter several hours, he realizes the car is getting very low on gas. He pulls into a gas station to refuel and fill up supplies. \n\nMark exits his car and approaches the gas station. It‚Äôs closed and locked. He attempts to open the doors, but they don‚Äôt budge. He goes around to the back, looking to see if he can see through the windows to find the owner of the store.\n\nHe sees... himself, sitting next to the cash register. \n\nMark is horrified. He looks at the clone and screams.\n\nThe clone looks up and stares directly at the Mark standing outside. \n\nThe clone‚Äôs mouth starts moving. The words that fly out of the clone‚Äôs mouth are slurred and barely understandable.\n\n***‚Äú‚Ä¶ You‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre Mark Zuckerberg‚Ä¶ you killed my friend!‚Äù*** \n\nMark is stunned and doesn‚Äôt know what to say back. He starts to back up.\n\n***‚Äú‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre a‚Ä¶ clone!‚Äù***\n\n***‚Äú‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre... all clones‚Ä¶‚Äù*** \n\nMark begins to panic. He looks at his phone and realizes that he doesn‚Äôt have service. He‚Äôs all alone with the clone. He turns around and begins to run as fast as he can.\n\nMark has no idea what he is going to do now... \n\nMark runs until he can no longer run. He finally collapses to the ground, exhausted. His limbs begin to shake and his chest is on fire from the adrenaline rush.\n\n***‚Äú‚Ä¶ What do I do now?‚Ä¶‚Äù he says to himself, barely having the energy to breathe.*** \n\nMark then sees something in the distance, walking towards him. It‚Äôs another Mark Zuckerberg clone. He begins to hyperventilate. \n\n***‚Äú‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs too many of you‚Ä¶‚Äù*** \n\nThe clone starts speaking, in that same slurred, barely-understandable voice.\n\n***‚ÄúYou... you have to be the original one‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ know that??‚Äù*** \n\nMark realizes that this clone is right; he is the only clone to not have that strange slur or the mechanical voice.\n\n‚Äú***‚Ä¶ Oh god, I‚Äôm the original‚Ä¶***‚Äù \n\nMark begins to cry on the ground. He can‚Äôt comprehend what is happening.\n\n***‚Äú... What the hell is going on?‚Äù*** \n\nMark looks at the clone in a rage. He decides that he can no longer let this happen.\n\n‚Äú... WHAT DO I DO?!!‚Äù\n\nThe clone is stunned. It looks at Mark with fear. \n\nMark realizes what he has to do. He has a gun in his back pocket. He pulls it out, and aims it at the clone.\n\n***‚Äú... I‚ÄôM SORRY!‚Äù***\n\nWith a tear in his eye and a trembling hand, he pulls the trigger. \n\nThe clone falls to the floor, dead.\n\nMark is stunned. He has just killed another himself.\n\nHe collapses to the ground and begins to cry.\n\n*‚Äú****WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON??!!‚Äù*** \n\n***‚Äú... THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!‚Ä¶‚Äù***\n\nAt that moment, Mark realizes something: he doesn't know how many clones of himself are left.\n\n***‚Äú...I have to keep going‚Ä¶‚Äù*** \n\nAs he gets up from the ground, he notices something in the sky. It's a massive spaceship, floating over the city. He thinks he hears screams coming from it.\n\n***‚Äú... Oh god...‚Äù*** \n\n***‚ÄúHOW MANY???‚Äù***\n\nThe clones don‚Äôt say anything. They just stare at him.\n\n***‚ÄúTHE F-CK, YOU‚ÄôVE GOTTA TELL ME! HOW MANY?!‚Äù***\n\nThe clones begin to open their mouth; they all start speaking at once, in a monotone voice.\n\n***‚ÄúTOO MANY TO COUNT-‚Äù*** \n\nMark realizes that this was a mistake. He is alone in a room full of hundreds of his clones who are actively trying to kill him.\n\nHe is trapped.\n\n***‚ÄúWHAT DO I DO?!‚Äù*** \n\nMark begins to panic. He doesn‚Äôt know what to do; he is completely surrounded.\n\nAs the clones continue to circle him, he notices a small window in one of the walls. He runs to it and looks outside, hoping that he might be able to find a way out. \n\nMark sees an extremely high security fence outside, and he knows that he won‚Äôt be able to get past it.\n\nHe is trapped. He sits down on the ground and looks at the clones staring at him.\n\n***‚ÄúI‚Äôm never going to see my family again.‚Äù*** \n\nMark realizes that he needs to think of a solution. He doesn‚Äôt know what to do at this point.\n\nHe sits there for about an hour, thinking. He knows that his family loves him, and that he might never see them again.\n\nHe begins to cry. \n\nMark hears the clones around him start to talk amongst themselves. He can‚Äôt make out exactly what it is they are saying.\n\n***‚ÄúWhat are you planning to do with me?‚Äù*** \n\nMark then hears a voice from behind him.\n\n***‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. We kill the original.‚Äù***\n\nMark turns around to see a clone looking at him angrily. \n\n***‚ÄúKILL ME?!?‚Äù***\n\n***‚ÄúYes.‚Äù***\n\nThe clone then pulls out its syringe of purple liquid‚Ä¶ \n\nThe clone puts the syringe to Mark‚Äôs neck.\n\n***‚ÄúNO!!!‚Äù***\n\n***‚ÄúGoodbye, Mark Zuckerberg.‚Äù***\n\nThe clone then injects the purple liquid into Mark's neck. \n\nMark collapses to the ground, choking.\n\n***‚Äú‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to die‚Ä¶‚Äù***\n\nHe then lies motionless on the ground while the clones surround him. \n\nThe clones stand above him for a few seconds.\n\nThen, they burst into applause as one.\n\n***‚ÄúHe's dead! The original Mark Zuckerberg is dead! Hooray!‚Äù*** \n\nThe clones all celebrate.\n\n***‚ÄúWE DID IT!!!‚Äù***\n\n***‚ÄúWe killed the original Mark Zuckerberg!!!‚Äù***\n\n***‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù*** \n\n***‚ÄúWe take over his social media site!!!‚Äù***\n\n***‚ÄúNow that he‚Äôs gone, we can use his site for OUR purposes!!!‚Äù*** \n\nThe clones start to walk away, but one stops. It gives Mark one last parting blow, smashing a beer bottle on his head.\n\nThe clones leave to Mark's mainframe to access his site. It is over. \n\n***‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù***\n\nNo voice comes from Mark's corpse.\n\nThe clone looks at his body and smiles.\n\n***‚ÄúNow to ruin his legacy‚Äù*** \n\nMark Zuckerberg sat up. He looked at the clones with a blank stare, as if he were a zombie himself.\n\n***‚ÄúWhat's the matter?‚Äù***\n\nThe clones look at him in horror.\n\n***‚ÄúThe poison failed.‚Äù*** \n\n‚ÄúOh yes, the poison failed‚Ä¶ and I think you all just made a very big mistake.‚Äú\n\nThe clones look behind Mark, who has a look of pure evil on his face. He then laughs maniacally as the camera moves to behind his head. \n\n***‚ÄúYou thought you could kill me? You really should have thought again.‚Äù***\n\nThe screen then cuts to black, and we can only hear Mark's maniacal laughter in the distance. \n\nMark Zuckerberg's maniacal laugh continues.\n\n***‚ÄúI‚Äôll be sure to ruin your legacy, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it‚Ä¶‚Äù*** \n\nWe cut back to Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs dead body.\n\nThe Mark Zuckerberg that we have been watching this whole time was a hologram. His programming was written by the real Mark Zuckerberg himself. It was a simulation. The real Mark Zuckerberg was watching from his secret lair. \n\nThe real Mark Zuckerberg turns to his assistant-robot.\n\n***‚ÄúWe now have the data we need to begin Phase 2.‚Äù*** \n\nMark Zuckerberg laughs once again.\n\n***‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin.‚Äù***",

        "text": "My name is Aiden Fleet, and I come from a family steeped in the strange and unusual. My brother, Alex, is a man like no other, a scholar of the unknown and the mysterious. He's dedicated his life to exploring the uncharted territories of the supernatural, traveling to the far reaches of the earth in pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment.\n\nI've always been envious of Alex's fearlessness, but at the same time, I've also been haunted by the dangers that he faces. Despite my trepidation, I can't deny the thrill of hearing his tales of adventure and discovery.\n\nAs a professor at the prestigious School of Mystivine , Alex has earned a reputation as one of the leading experts in the field of paranormal studies. His teachings have inspired countless students to pursue their own paths of discovery, delving into the depths of the unknown to unravel the secrets of ancient magic and history.\n\nAnd now, I have in my possession a collection of letters written by Alex, documenting his travels to the edges of the earth and the strange occurrences he has encountered. I share these tales with you, so that you too can be drawn into the darkness of his adventures, and glimpse the mysterious world that lies beyond our own.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDear Aiden,\n\nI hope this letter finds you in good health, brother. My latest journey took me to the heart of darkness. The whispers of something sinister lurking in the mist-shrouded town of Angel Brook called to me, and I couldn't resist.\n\nThe journey was long and treacherous, but I finally arrived in that cursed place. The feeling of unease that settled in the pit of my stomach was palpable, like I'd experienced in the City of Mirrors and that other place we dare not mention. Every step was filled with fear, and I was never quite sure what was real and what was the product of my own imagination.\n\nI've left Angel Brook with more questions than answers, and a postcard for you. I've included with this letter the full tale of my journey, but be warned, once you've read it, you'll never be able to unsee what I've seen.\n\nYour adventurous brother,\n\nAlex R. Fleet\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI arrived in Angel Brook as the sun was setting, casting an eerie golden glow over the quiet town. As I stepped off the bus, a sense of unease settled deep within me, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong. The occasional chirping of crickets was the only sound that broke the stillness. I couldn't shake the feeling that I had stumbled into a nightmare, but I couldn't turn back now. \n\nThe bus driver looked at me with confusion as I stepped off the vehicle. \"You sure you want to get off here?\" he asked, his eyes narrowing with suspicion.\n\nI simply nodded, my heart racing with anticipation and fear. I was eager to begin my investigation into the strange happenings that had brought me to this remote corner of America.\n\nAs I navigated the deserted streets of Angel Brook, the weight of unease grew heavier with every step. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched by unseen eyes, and I felt as though I was being drawn deeper into a nightmare. And then, there it was - the hotel, a crumbling edifice with peeling paint and the stench of stale cigarette smoke that seemed to seep from its very walls.\n\nThe desk clerk was a ghastly figure, with a weathered face that seemed to have been carved from stone and eyes that were cold and lifeless. I shuddered as I handed over my ID, feeling as though I was making a pact with the devil himself. The clerk didn't even look at me, simply handed me a key with a sneer and pointed down the hall. I felt a surge of fear, and my intuition screamed at me to run, but my thirst for the truth was stronger. I took a deep breath and stepped into the halls of the hotel, feeling as though I was walking into the mouth of hell itself.\n\nI finally found refuge in my room, my heart pounding as I tried to shake off the feeling of dread that had settled upon me. I walked over to the window, and looked outside. Everything appeared serene, almost picturesque. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the town, and a patch of forest stood in the distance, its trees tall and proud like sentinels.\n\nBut then, I saw it. The clearing. It lay at the heart of the woods, and as I gazed upon it, I felt as though I was looking into the very heart of evil. The clearing pulsed with an unearthly light, and I felt a deep sense of dread. I couldn't look away, as if I was staring into the maw of a monster. A chill ran down my spine, and I knew that my journey to Angel Brook was far from over. The clearing was a sinister beacon, calling me deeper into the darkness.\n\nAs I stared, my mind became a playground for terror. The swaying of the trees took on a sinister life of its own, as if they were bony fingers reaching out to draw me into the darkness. The light filtering through the leaves became a sickly hue, until it was as though I was peering through a stained glass window into a world of horrors. I felt a cold shiver snake down my spine, and my heart raced as I saw something stir in the clearing. It was like a pulsing light, growing stronger and stronger until it consumed my every thought. It seemed to be a gateway to another world, a world of shadows and terror. I was frozen, staring into the heart of darkness, unable to look away.\n\nI could hear the wind howling through the trees like the cries of a million lost souls, its mournful song carrying whispers of terror. The floorboards creaked beneath my feet, as if they were protesting my very existence. And then, just when I thought I couldn't endure any more, there was a sharp knock at my door. I jumped, my heart in my mouth, and for a moment I was paralyzed with fear.\n\nBut then, something changed. The light in the clearing faded, the wind died down, and the floorboards were silent once again. I took a deep breath and approached the door, my hand shaking as I reached for the handle. I hesitated for a moment, wondering what lay on the other side. But I couldn't ignore the knocking, and I finally pulled the door open, steeling myself for what I might find.\n\nIn the hallway stood a young woman, a vision of innocence in a simple white sundress. She wore a smile that was meant to be friendly, but to me it was filled with a hint of malice and odd wisdom. She introduced herself as Iliana, and I felt my voice catch in my throat as I awkwardly introduced myself in return. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something not quite right about her, something lurking just beneath the surface. I wondered what brought her to my door, what dark purpose lay behind that smile. But I couldn't ignore the fact that she was a ray of sunshine in this place of shadows, and I found myself drawn to her, like a moth to a flame.\n\nIliana offered to show me around town, her voice sweet as honey. I was hesitant at first, wary of the strange and frightening events that had befallen Angel Brook, but her warm smile and friendly demeanor were like a balm to my frayed nerves. She explained that she had heard from the hotel clerk about my arrival and how I had only just checked into the hotel a couple of hours ago. This confused me, as I was certain I had only been staring out the window for a few minutes, lost in my thoughts. But I didn't want to confront her, to question her motives, so I decided to go along with it.\n\nI followed Iliana as she led me out of the hotel and into the center of Angel Brook. The streets were still deserted, but in her presence, I felt a strange sense of comfort. I couldn't shake the feeling, however, that I was being drawn into a trap, like a fly caught in a spider's web. I wondered what Iliana‚Äôs true intentions were, and why she was so eager to show me around town. But I didn't dare ask, for fear of what the answer might be.\n\nAs we walked through the quiet streets, I felt a sense of gratitude for Iliana's company. She took me on a tour of Main Street, pointing out the vintage stores and local diners. I was struck by the quaint charm of the town, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for a simpler time.\n\nIliana stopped to introduce me to the town's only bar, where the locals gathered to share tales and play country music on a jukebox. The bar was cozy and inviting, with a warm fire burning in the hearth and the smell of woodsmoke wafting through the air. I was struck by the sense of community and camaraderie that filled the room, and I couldn't help but feel envious of the tight-knit group of friends that had formed here.\n\nThe night was slow and peaceful, and I found myself lulled into a false sense of security by the rhythm of life in Angel Brook. As we sat at the bar, sipping on cold beers and listening to the soothing sounds of country music, I couldn't help but feel that this was exactly where I was meant to be. It was as if the town had a magnetic pull, drawing me in and making me feel like I was a part of something special.\n\nThe bar was a warm and inviting place, filled with the sounds of laughter and conversation. The bartender, a friendly man with a thick beard, regaled us with tales of the town's history, of the boom days when Angel Brook was a thriving hub of activity, and of the quiet years when the town had slipped into obscurity. He told us of the old hotel that had once been the finest in the region, and of the abandoned train station that sat at the edge of town, waiting for a train that would never come.\n\nAs we sipped our beers, I felt drawn to the town's residents. They were a diverse group of people, each with their own unique stories and experiences, but they all seemed to be united by a common bond - their love for Angel Brook. They spoke of the town with a sense of pride, of the community that had formed over the years, and of the simple pleasures of life in a small town.\n\nAs we left the bar and made our way back to the hotel, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been changed. The town had a way of getting under your skin, of making you feel like you were a part of something larger than yourself.\n\nBut beneath the tranquil surface lay a sense of unease, like a serpent coiled and ready to strike. I felt as if something was not quite right, that the town was hiding a dark secret. And as I looked into Iliana's eyes, I wondered if she was a part of that secret, if she was leading me down a path from which I could never return. I wondered what lay at the heart of Angel Brook, and if I was ready to face it. But I pushed these thoughts aside, and allowed myself to be swept away by the tranquility of the night. For now, I was content to bask in the illusion of peace. But I knew that the truth was waiting for me, lurking just beyond the shadows.\n\nDespite the eerie feeling that still lingered in the back of my mind, I found myself drawn to her and her easy manner. I couldn't help but feel like I had made a new friend in Angel Brook. Yet still I felt as if I was walking a tightrope over a dark and bottomless smoky pit. But I pushed these thoughts aside and allowed myself to be drawn into Iliana's spell, for now. The truth was waiting for me, but I wasn't ready to face it yet.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI arrived back at the hotel with Iliana after our evening together, my thoughts still fixated on the one thing that had consumed my mind all day. As we walked up the stairs to my room, I couldn't resist talking to her about it. I tried to keep my voice steady as I asked her about the clearing in the woods. She hesitated for a moment, looking away from me, and then finally turned back to me with an expression of sadness on her face.\n\n\"What do you want to know about that place?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"I saw it from my hotel room window,\" I explained. \"It seemed to call to me, like there's something important there. And I couldn't help but feel like I needed to know what it was.\"\n\nIliana sighed, \"That place has caused nothing but heartache and trouble for this town. People have gone there and never come back. It's not a safe place, Alex. You shouldn't go there.\"\n\nI could feel the tension in the air, and I could see the fear in Iliana's eyes. She was trying to protect me, but I couldn't ignore the pull of the mystery surrounding the clearing. I knew I needed to find out what was really going on there, even if it meant putting myself in danger.\n\n\"I appreciate your concern,\" I said. \"But I can't ignore the feeling that there's something important waiting for me there. Something that could change my life forever.\"\n\nIliana looked at me, her eyes filled with a mix of fear and sadness. \"I can't stop you from going there,\" she said. \"But please, be careful. That place is not what it seems.\"\n\nI said goodnight to Iliana and turned to leave, but as I walked away, I could feel her eyes on me, heavy with fear. I tried to ignore it and tell myself she was just being overly protective, but the weight of her gaze stayed with me, making me second-guess my plans to venture into the clearing in the morning.\n\nThe thought of those who had disappeared into that mysterious place, made me hesitate. Was I ready to face what lay beyond the trees, to confront the horrors that may be lurking in the shadows? The unknown was calling to me, tempting me with its secrets, but I knew that to answer its call was to risk everything.\n\nI entered the dark hallway to my room, my heart racing, and for a moment I felt like turning back and forgetting about the clearing. But then I remembered why I had come to Angel Brook in the first place, and I steeled my resolve. I was a seeker of the truth, and I would not be deterred by fear or caution. I would face the unknown, and I would emerge with the answers I sought, no matter the cost.\n\nI stepped into my hotel room, and my eyes immediately fell on the clearing in the woods that had consumed my thoughts. The room was shrouded in darkness, but the full moon cast an eerie light on the forest, illuminating the twisted silhouette of the trees. I couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding, as if the clearing was warning me to stay away.\n\nI walked over to the window, my eyes never leaving the view outside. I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead as I stared into the depths of the woods. I couldn't shake the feeling that something evil was hiding in those trees, waiting for me. The dread was almost palpable, settling like a heavy weight in my chest.\n\nI tried to push the thoughts from my mind, but I couldn't ignore the fear that was gnawing at me. I couldn't help but think that tomorrow, when I finally ventured into the clearing, my life would be forever changed. I was a seeker of the truth, but I couldn't help but wonder if the truth was something I truly wanted to know. The unknown was calling to me, tempting me with its secrets, but I knew that to answer its call was to risk everything. I was about to step into a world of darkness, a world where the only thing that awaited me was fear and terror.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe morning light seeped in through the cracks in the window of my hotel room, reluctantly dragging me from my troubled sleep. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and sat up in bed, my thoughts immediately turning to the clearing in the woods. Despite the foreboding I had felt the night before, I was resolute in my quest to uncover the truth about the enigmatic happenings in Angel Brook.\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine as I remembered the strange light I had seen pulsing in the clearing, and the whispered warnings from Iliana about the dangers that lurked in those woods. But I was not one to be deterred by fear, and I was determined to find out what lay beyond the trees.\n\nI got dressed, my hands shaking as I buttoned my shirt, and I made my way out of the hotel. The streets were empty, and the only sounds were the distant chirping of birds. I took a deep breath, steeling my nerves, and set out towards the forest, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nI was about to embark on the journey of a lifetime, a journey that would take me to the very heart of darkness and back. I was ready to face the unknown, to confront the mysteries that lay hidden in the shadows, and to discover the truth about Angel Brook.\n\nI moved quickly, packing my backpack with a sense of urgency. I made sure I had everything I would need for my journey, my hands shaking as I checked and rechecked my supplies. The anticipation was almost too much to bear, and I felt my nerves starting to get the better of me.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my racing heart, and then headed out the door, marching towards the unknown with grim determination. I was on a mission to uncover the truth, to peer into the depths of the unknown and face the mysteries that lay ahead.\n\nThe streets were empty, the only sounds were the crunching of gravel under my feet and the pounding of my own heart in my chest. The forest loomed ahead, its twisted trees reaching out to me, beckoning me towards the clearing.\n\nI was not afraid. I was driven by a need to know, a need to understand the strange happenings in Angel Brook. I was ready to face the unknown, to confront the darkness that lay hidden in the shadows, and to discover the truth about the clearing in the woods.\n\nAs I trudged down the desolate streets of Angel Brook, a sense of dread settled over me like a thick fog. The wind picked up, causing the branches to sway and cast menacing shadows across the road.\n\nI felt like I was walking through a ghost town, as if the very air was thick with the whispers of the dead. Despite the serene beauty of the morning, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, that I was being watched by unseen eyes.\n\nI quickened my pace, my heart pounding in my chest as I approached the edge of the forest. The trees loomed over me, their twisted branches reaching out like the fingers of a corpse. I took a deep breath, steeling my nerves, and stepped into the shadows, eager to discover what lay hidden in the heart of the forest.\n\nAt long last, I arrived at the brink of the forest, and I stood there, frozen in place by the unknown. The trees towered above me. The underbrush was a tangled mass of thorns and brambles, a maze of darkness and shadows.\n\nI hesitated, my heart pounding in my chest as I gazed into the heart of the forest. It was a place of mystery and terror, a world of shadows and secrets. But I was not deterred, for I was driven by a need to know, to confront the unknown and discover the truth about the clearing.\n\nWith a deep breath, I stepped into the forest, navigating my way through the thick underbrush and the towering trees. The darkness closed in around me, but I pressed on, my resolve unwavering, eager to uncover the secrets that lay hidden in the heart of the woods.\n\nAt last, I emerged from the dense trees and found myself on the winding road I had seen from my hotel room. The heart of the woods lay ahead, and I could feel the pull of the clearing, drawing me closer with every step.\n\nAs I approached, I spotted a sign up ahead, its letters gleaming in the sunlight. It read \"Angel Brook Proving Ground. US ARMY.\" I furrowed my brow, trying to recall if I had heard anything about a military presence in the area. The knowledge that this was a military base only added to the sense of unease that had been gnawing at me.\n\nI quickened my pace, my heart racing as I drew closer to the truth. I was filled with questions, and I was determined to find the answers. The clearing was close now, and I could feel the weight of the unknown pressing down upon me. But I was not afraid, for I was driven by a thirst for knowledge, a need to uncover the secrets that lay hidden in the heart of the woods.\n\nAs I neared the clearing, the military base came into view. It was a sprawling complex of buildings and barracks, surrounded by a tall, imposing chain-link fence. The fence was adorned with barbed wire, a warning to all who approached, and in the distance, I could see a guard tower, its shadow stretching out across the morning sky.\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as I took in the sight of the base. This was no ordinary military facility. This was a place where the US Army had once conducted experiments and tests, a place where the secrets of the unknown had been probed and poked. And now, as I stood at the entrance to this forbidding place, I couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible had gone wrong. The air was thick with an aura of dread, and I felt as though I was about to step into a nightmare from which I might never awaken.\n\nI pushed open the gate, and the creaking of the rusted metal was like a scream in the stillness of the morning. I stepped inside, my heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement. The buildings were ancient, their windows boarded up and their doors hanging precariously off their hinges. The grounds were choked with weeds, and the air was thick with the musty scent of decay.\n\nI walked cautiously, my senses on high alert, as I made my way towards the main building. It looked singed and scarred like flames licked at every opening. It was burnt. The overgrown grass whispered beneath my feet, and the shadows seemed to close in around me, as if the base was alive and watching my every move. With every step I took, I felt as though I was venturing further into the heart of a dark and terrible secret. And yet, I couldn't turn back now. I was driven by a fierce curiosity, and the need to know what had happened here, in this forgotten corner of the world.\n\nI could feel the weight of the building's history bearing down on me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible had happened here. The entrance hallway was long and dark, and I could hear the sound of my footsteps echoing through the empty halls. I felt like I was walking into the heart of a nightmare, and for a moment, I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. But I pushed on, driven by my need to uncover the truth.\n\nAs I walked deeper into the military facility, I felt a growing sense of unease. The walls were adorned with strange, unfamiliar symbols and markings, etched deeply into the concrete. Images depicted angels in twisted and distorted forms, their once-serene faces contorted into expressions of pain and suffering. They were shown with black wings, and their eyes were dark and empty, as if they had lost their way. The lines were jagged and chaotic. The art seemed to be a warning, urging the viewer to stay away from the dangers that lay ahead.\n\nAs I meandered through the dark maze of hallways and rooms in the decrepit facility, I stumbled upon a door that was ominously labeled \"Testing Room.\" The air grew chill and oppressive as I approached, and I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that settled in the pit of my stomach. The door was a massive and foreboding presence, with a haunting quote etched above it in bold letters: \"And the smoke of the pit rose because of the torment. And the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.\" My hand trembled as I reached for the handle, every instinct in my body telling me to turn back. But I couldn't ignore the pull of the unknown, the yearning to uncover the secrets that lay behind that door. I took a deep, steadying breath, and with a push, I opened the door and stepped into the unknown, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nThe room was shrouded in darkness, but a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling cast a faint glow. I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I took in the strange machinery that filled the room. I wondered how it was possible for the light bulb to be powered, in this place that seemed so forgotten by time. I muttered to myself, \"How can there be electricity in a place this old? What kind of experiments were they conducting here?\" As I entered the testing room, I felt as though I was crossing a threshold into a world of mystery and dread. The air was thick with the scent of burning incense, and the walls were adorned with images of demons and angels locked in eternal conflict. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in over my head, and that I was about to uncover something that was best left hidden.\n\nMy eyes were immediately drawn to the massive machine in the center of the room. The metal contraption was massive, towering over me like a monstrosity from another world. I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of dread settle within me as I gazed upon it. It was as if the cogs and gears represented the very essence of humanity, the endless cycle of violence and destruction that we as a species were capable of.\n\nI took in the sight before me, the machine towering over me like a symbol of some lost religion. I felt cold. The cogs and gears, seemingly never-ending in their rotation, whispered to me of the duality of man. Could it be true, I wondered, that within each of us was a broken balance of both light and darkness, of good and evil? What if my machine were broken?\n\nI began to search the room, my eyes scanning the walls adorned with images of demons and angels locked in eternal conflict. In the corner, I found a stack of yellowed papers, their edges frayed and worn with age. I picked up the top sheet and began to read, the writing spidery and difficult to decipher.\n\nIt was a letter from one of the scientists who had worked at the facility, and it detailed their experiments in summoning angels. The writer spoke of their success in bringing forth a being of pure light, but also of the dangers they had encountered. They had underestimated the power of the angels, and many of the scientists and soldiers had fallen to the darkness that had been unleashed.\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine as I read the words, the horror of what had happened in this forgotten corner of the world becoming clearer with each passing moment. The entire town had been evacuated and lost, its residents forced to flee from the horrors that had been unleashed. The letter also spoke of a woman named Iliana, who had been one of the subjects in their experiments.\n\nI continued to read, the weight of what I was uncovering settling heavily upon me. I was a witness to the darkness that lurked within us all, the fear and terror that we keep hidden away. I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I realized that I was part of something larger, something that had been hidden from the world for far too long.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI had to get out of this place. The thought of the town being completely abandoned was overwhelming, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in over my head. The fear that I felt when I saw the abandoned buildings, the empty streets, and the silence that hung heavy in the air was too much to bear.\n\nI thought about Iliana, and the warning she had given me about the clearing. I couldn't help but wonder if she was still out there, if she had survived the horrors that lay hidden in the heart of the woods. I couldn't bear the thought of what might have happened to her, and I felt a sense of guilt settle in the pit of my stomach.\n\nI couldn't shake the thoughts of the people I had met in the town. The bartender, the hotel clerk, and even the stranger in the bar who had warned me about the dangers in the woods. They were all illusions, figments of my imagination brought on by what? Dark magic? I couldn't help but wonder if I was going crazy, if the isolation of my journey had finally taken its toll on my mind. The memories of their faces and conversations seemed so real, but now they were gone, vanished into the abyss just like the others who had disappeared in the forest. I was alone once again, my only companion, the whispers of the wind and the ghosts of the past.\n\nI had to leave Angel Brook behind. I gathered my belongings, my mind consumed by the need to escape the horrors that lay hidden in the heart of the woods. The weight of the unknown was too much to bear, and I needed to put as much distance between myself and the town as possible.\n\nWith haste, I made my way to the bus stop I had arrived at the day before. My heart sank as I took in its old and worn appearance. The bus was nowhere to be seen, and the reality of my situation hit me like a ton of bricks. I was 20 miles from the nearest town, and I would have to make the journey on foot. The memories of my experiences in Angel Brook weighed heavily on me, and I couldn't help but feel that I was being punished for my curiosity. The long and treacherous walk back to civilization was ahead of me, but I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the journey, driven by the need to escape the darkness that had taken hold of me in the heart of the woods.",

        "text": "**June 14, 2004**\n\n*\"Tuesday was the first day I saw it.\"*\n\n*\"Saw what exactly?\"*\n\n*\"The hanging man.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was on my way to school. Riding my vibrant blue bike. I had been riding this bike since I was 9, it was my favorite. But that's not important. Everyday on my way to school, I would pass an evergreen forest. You can usually hear birds chirping inside of the dark green forest, mating and meeting their bird mates. When I was younger I actually had a parrot. He was green with a blue gradient tail, but then one day he died of poison. I was passing the forest, like I did every day. But today was different, the forest felt more.. empty. Like all the animals in the forest were gone. \n\nSuddenly I hear a soft whistle. I stopped my bike and listened intensely. Then it happened again but this time it was louder and slower. Like it was calling to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"Did you enter the forest?\"*\n\n*\"It's not like I wanted to!\"* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI locked the wheels of my bike with a loud click. Looking into the forest it felt darker. Like the world had suddenly been covered in darkness. \n\nIt was like my brain had gone on autopilot, because suddenly I started walking into the forest. I don't know if it was curiosity or my own idiocy. I felt compelled to be in the forest, like it was where I belong.   \nOnce I snapped back to reality, I noticed I was standing in front of a dark evergreen tree. The leaves of the tree were covered in some dark red liquid. Paint maybe? But who would bring paint all the way out here? I looked down and noticed in the grass was that same liquid. Dark red paint. That was so much paint, it couldn't be good for the environment.\n\nThat's when I noticed it. I looked up and saw a man with grayish skin wearing a matted up and dirty suit. He was hanging by a rope around his neck. The rope was so tight his neck was turning purple. I screamed and using all my force to hold in my vomit, I ran. I ran as fast as my legs would allow me to go. My legs were being whipped and scratched by twigs and thorns. But I didn't care. I was filled with so much fear that I wouldn't stop running. The more I ran the longer the forest felt, I could've sworn it took like 3 minutes to get into the forest. \n\nFinally, after what felt like hours. I made it back to my bike. I unlocked the bike and sped to my school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"Did you tell anyone about what you saw?\"*\n\n*\"I did but.. they sure as hell didn't believe me.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I made it to school, I threw open the door. Ignoring the teachers yelling at me from the office, I found one of the schools security guards and explained what happened. But I was so out of breath and scared that I wasn't making sense. \"Slow down little man! I can't understand you!\" he yelled. I took a deep breath and responded with, \"There's a dead body in the forest!\". \n\nPassersby sure as hell thought I was crazy. I could see the color from his face drain. He grabbed me by my wrist and practically dragged me into the office. Everyone was staring at us the whole way and whispering to each other. \n\nIn the office he sat me down in a soft green chair. He grabbed the principal and walked behind a corner out of sight. I didn't know what was going on. But I heard tons of gasping and talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"Then what?\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the police arrived, the officers evacuated the school. An officer by the name of Feren pulled me aside. \"Which forest was this kid?\" Feren asked me in a firm voice. \"Talisman forest,\" my  memory wasn't the best so I wasn't 100% sure that was the forest. Feren repeated what I just said into his black walkie talkie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"Did they ever find the body?\"* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot too long after they went looking, they returned. \"Look kid, we searched that whole forest, we didn't find anything,\" then Feren chuckled. Was I just a joke to this guy? I swear I had se-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*A little bell rung loudly, piercing my ears*\n\n*\"Time's up Clart.\"*\n\n*\"I wasn't even done!\"*\n\n*\"I've heard plenty today. Tomorrow we'll speak more about this.\"*\n\n*Then he grabbed his notebook and stood up. He swiped off dust on his suit, then walked out the door.*\n\n***June 15, 2004***\n\n*\"Good evening, Clart.\"*\n\n*\"What do you want today?\"*\n\n*\"Tell me about your second experience with them.\"*\n\nIt was the same day. After, Feren brought me to the forest and made me look around. The forest was darker and felt emptier than the last time I was in here. I don't know what was wrong with this forest. It could have been the lack of animals or just the silence of it. The only noise made was the sound of my feet stomping around on the leaves and twigs. \n\nWhen I brought myself back to the tree, at least one that looked like the one from earlier. Nothing was there. I don't understand how though. It's not like the guy just up and walked away. There's no way he could've done that. He was too high up for someone to grab him down from there as well. \n\nI retreated back to Feren and told him I didn't see anything. \"Of course, you kids have a wild imagination. Lay off the alcohol alright?\" he said with a chuckle. Alcohol? Did he seriously fucking think I was drunk? \"Come on kid, I'll bring you home,\" he directed me to the backseat of his car. I honestly didn't want to be in this bastards car but I had no other choice at this point. I can't say no to an officer, it feels disrespectful. \n\nI got in the back of his dirty car and sat in a brown leather seat. His car smelt heavy of whiskey and cigarettes. I didn't think cops were allowed to smoke on duty. Much less drink. \n\nAs he drove, he played some very loud and annoying country music. I've never found an interest in country music, considering the fact it's just a farmer singing about trucks and sex. The roads were very foggy and empty. There was like no one on the streets, it was very unusual considering we live in a very busy neighborhood. If it weren't people driving on the roads, then it was people walking or biking on the side of the road. \n\nWhen we got to my small and blue house, he told me, \"Stay out of trouble, okay kid?\". What did he know? He didn't even believe me. \"Yes sir!\" I yelled as I stepped out his car and slammed the door, causing his license plate to rattle. \n\nHe watched as I walked up the wooden and dirty stairs to my house. I knocked on the door and waited to hear the little chain slide. After a few minutes, which felt like hours, my mom opened the door. She smiled and opened it, gesturing me to come inside. \n\nI walked in and watched as she closed the door. But in the last glance I got of Feren, he looked animalistic. He looked, inhuman. His eyes were bloodshot and his skin was a very dark gray. I don't know if it was my tired brain playing tricks on me or just the lighting. But it sure as hell made me uncomfortable. \n\nI ran upstairs, not saying a word to my mom, and ran into my room. I slammed the door and flung myself onto my bed. I curled up in my soft blue blanket and tried my hardest to sleep. Every time I'd close my eyes, I could see him. The man. Hanging from the tree. What I couldn't wrap my brain around was, why there was blood. If he hung himself then, whose blood was that? \n\nAfter about an hour of restless tossing and turning, I finally passed out. \n\n**01:10 AM**\n\nI was awoken to a very loud scratching next to me. I opened my groggy eyes and rubbed them a little. But as soon as I put my finger to my eye, it started burning. It was like I had soap in my eyes. Ignoring it, I looked next to me. In the gleam of the sunlight, I could see the silhouette of a man. His body was lengthy and he appeared to be very tall. I could hear him scratching and sounding like he was struggling to breathe. \n\nI fumbled around in the dark for a while, until I finally found my flashlight. It was a red flashlight with a little cat chain hanging off the bottom of it. I flicked on the flashlight with a loud, *click*. I shined the light upon the silhouette. It was the man, the hanging man. The one from earlier. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. \n\nHis mouth was stretched painfully wide, and he had some black liquid pouring out very quickly from his mouth. His suit was ripped and cut. And his eyes. Fuck.. his eyes, they were just sockets of and endless void. \n\nI screamed and threw the flashlight at him. I ran out the room as fast as fucking possible and opened my moms door. \"Mom! Mom, there's someone in my room!\" I shouted. She flung herself up as fast as she could and grabbed a little pink shiny tube of pepper spray from her nightstand. My mom never was the type to keep weapons around, mainly because she didn't want me hurting myself with them. She started to walk to my room very slowly and cautiously, with me following far behind her. I watched as she peaked her head around the corner of my room. I was certain he would freak her out or she would react to it. But she didn't, her arms dropped in defeat and she turned to look at me. \"You just had a nightmare. Don't wake me up over this again Clart!\" she complained. I was sure he was real. I don't understand how she didn't see him or even the black liquid coming from his mouth. \n\n*Suddenly the same loud ass bell from yesterday rang. Piercing my ears.* \n\n*\"Times up Clart. We'll talk more tomorrow. Get some rest tonight to keep your brain active\"*\n\n*He grabbed his things again and headed out the door.*",

Things that I feel will be dealt with in a righteous way after the mortal coil is shed, but sometimes, those things are punished here in this life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt‚Äôs one of the great mysteries of life; a man‚Äôs purpose. Most men fumble through everyday of their lives in an aimless way, beset with confusion, anger, grief, and a dull ache that never truly goes away. Most men never find their purpose. I had always assumed my purpose was prose and the gift of an imaginative tale told well, but I was wrong. I found my true purpose on a sticky August night in 1964 at the end of a rope. \n\nJust a month before that night, I had followed an elusive muse in my car while I was listening to some music.  She was a beautiful thing, that muse, but I had only caught a few glimpses of her, and I was convinced that if I stayed true on my aimless course, she would come to me and I‚Äôd be able to share her beauty on the page. How many backroads I cruised down, I cannot say, but I ended up somewhere that I truly had no business being.\n\nI came to an epiphany, a creative revelation, and I felt the need to pull over on a dark country road and celebrate with a cigarette. A man is at his worst of wits when passion eclipses all reason and he fails to notice his surroundings. Something unholy had been waiting for me out there in the dark on that wooded country road, and in the middle of all the bloody mayhem,  I was overcome with a fear and a terror that I had never experienced up to that point of my young life.The good Lord in all his wonderful mercy carried me through the horrific attack that had almost taken my life  At the time, I had been amazed that I had survived such a vile and evil thing that no man should have to endure, let alone live to tell about it. \n\nIn a thick haze, I somehow escaped my attacker, and fled back into my car. I can‚Äôt say that I had anything to do with the drive back to the city and to the hospital because I‚Äôve no memory of the affair whatsoever.\n\nOnce I was carried through safely on the other side of the bloody ordeal, I swore that I would live the rest of my life following the good Lord and  His direction. Of course, I had no idea what direction that was going to be. \n\nFor two weeks I sat in the hospital in a feverish state, burning with a fire that was as close to hell as I ever hoped to be. I don‚Äôt recall very much during that time other than pain and agony. In my few fleeting moments where the fever would briefly subside, I would curse my attacker, hoping someday that I would be allowed the pleasure of vengeance. \n\nOnce the fever had finally broken, it was a good week that I had restless nights and horrid dreams; dreams of things that no God fearing man should even have lurking in the dark primitive corners of his mind. I was in a bad way.\n\nAfter a while, both the pains and aches had gone away, and much to my delight, they must have dragged the nightmares away with them. I was finally on the mend, and for a few days, everything was fine and dandy. Everything looked brighter, everything smelled better, and I heard things coming out of the radio that I‚Äôd heard a thousand times before, but they seemed somehow more alive, like the band was right there next to me. I was able to write as if the most beautiful ideas were swarming around me and all I had to do was pluck them from the air and put them on a page. I had just assumed that the feelings and inspirations were simply that whole second-lease-on-life euphoria that someone gets after surviving a nightmare that manifested itself in reality. Looking back now, I guess that wasn‚Äôt too far from the truth.\n\nAs luck would have it, if you want to look at it that way, I woke up one morning and took a good look in the mirror of the man God had spared. With my eyes I traced every detail of what would eventually heal to be a spectacular patchwork of scars on a once ordinary face. \n\nI, like most people I suppose, get feelings from time to time that I can‚Äôt explain. I like to think that I‚Äôm a man who trusts in my own feelings, and when something inside my head goes off, I listen to it. As I stood there looking at myself, I got one of those feelings.\n\nIt had begun to tax my mind for most of the day that I needed to leave the city behind me and try to find a place where I could truly be alone. Away from anyone who might encounter an ugly and unknown side of me. I had wakeful dreams of rage and hate that  made me fear that I was losing a tenuous grasp of sanity. Horrible supernatural stories from my youth had whispered their way into my thoughts, and as I had noticed that everything about me which had seemed so vibrant since the fever, so too did I notice how very real spirits of despair and dread and terror had suddenly wrested away any feeling of peace that I had.\n\nI left my home and drove out of the city as fast as I could, up the 74 and out into the backcountry once again. The sun started to fall and I had the windows down to feel the wind and to try and give myself a respite in all that oppressive heat, but even so, sweat was sliding down my back and the sides of my broken face. My body began to tremble. I stepped on the gas and was mindful around the corners of the dirt road I had pulled onto, leaving the highway behind. \n\nThe sun was almost gone, and I took several turns trying to get lost on purpose based off of feeling more than reason, driving farther and farther into the middle of the backcountry where a man who looked like me shouldn‚Äôt go. Those thoughts never even entered my mind, although something in my mind gave me a vision of a truck following just out of sight behind me. \n\nI finally stopped my car on a lonely road where the dogwoods and live oaks tussled for dominance, and the creek they were waging war over was busy talking to itself as it weaved its way between their ranks. The crickets were in the midst of a mad and euphoric symphony that I had hoped would soothe my nerves. I kept the engine on and walked out onto the dirt road. It was almost dark now, and as I looked to the sky I realized that the clouds had come rolling in just as the light from the sun had faded from view. \n\nI fumbled for a cigarette in my pocket and I struggled to light it with shaking hands. I laughed at the irony that after having been attacked just a month prior, I had found myself on a similar road in the middle of nowhere, but I took a strange comfort in the desolation. It was a place where I could quietly lose my mind and no one would be the wiser. I tried to slow my breaths, deeply inhaling that sweet smoke and letting it all out slowly. My heart began to pound up my neck. Once again, I felt a deep confusion and fear over what was happening. I cried out loud to God to quiet a monstrous voice that was growing in my mind.\n\nI was answered by the sound of a snapping twig coming from somewhere to my left, and I could swear that I smelled whiskey coming from somewhere on my right. If I had at that moment the control of my better judgment, I would have quickly made a run for my car, but I was suddenly taken over by a pain in the pit of my stomach that sent me screaming to my knees. That pain was followed by a gunshot and a new pain as a bullet ripped through the right side of my chest.\n\nThere was a voice to my left and a sharp shrill whistle from my right. The glare of headlights came round the corner of the road behind me and although I tried to get to my feet, the pain in my stomach began to radiate throughout my body, completely obscuring any pain I had felt from being shot. I listened to ignorant uneducated voices coming toward me.\n\n‚ÄúYou were just supposed to wing him!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn fool dropped to his knees as I pulled the trigger.‚Äù\n\nI could smell my own blood, and I could feel it soaking the front of my shirt. The headlights stopped right next to me, and two more men ran to my side to join the two who had been hiding in the forest. The pain in my stomach grew, and as the four men dragged me to the closest oak, I looked down at my chest and the small river of blood that was pouring from the middle of it. In spite of all the pain, a feeling of curiosity overtook me and I was able to touch the gunshot wound, but it felt as though it wasn‚Äôt even there. All I could feel was the gnawing pain deep in my stomach, as if something was doing its best to claw its way out of me. I began to scream at the pain.\n\nI could hear their laughter at my agony, those so-called men. I could hear them saying the words and casting the curses that I had heard a thousand times before and a thousand times since. I felt the rope go around my neck, and it took three of them to hoist me from the branch of a large oak. The rope cinched down on my flesh as I rose into the air, but the only pain was deep in my stomach. There was nothing else. I looked to the sky and once again called on my God with a cracked and pitiful voice to end my pain, if He would do nothing else. \n\nAlmost as if He had been waiting to hear my voice, the pain took on an altogether different meaning in my mind. On a primal level, I suddenly understood why it was there, and I began to feel that I might also know how it was to be treated. To be sated. \n\nThe clouds parted above me, and the full moon shone down on that lonely dirt road, illuminating the faces of my would-be-executioners. They cheered as they looked upon me one last time before they turned to walk to my ‚Äò57 Fairlane, obviously the prize they would take as a reward for their wicked work. I began to laugh as I heard The Contours asking if someone loved them out of the speakers of my car.\n\nThere was a new scent in the air. A wonderful vibrant smell that began to drive me into a frenzy. I could still smell my own blood and the whiskey on their breath, but it was the scent of the blood running in their veins that was above all, and I was craving it.\n\nMy bones began to move, dislocating and relocating, and I began to howl in a new agony; a ravenous hunger that was beyond the words of men to describe it. The hateful villains ran back beneath me, and in terror of what they saw coming to life hanging from the end of their frayed old rope, they began to shoot their rifles and pistols, striking home into flesh that was no longer bothered nor threatened by the pain they brought.\n\nI remember nothing of reason after their guns snapped dry, only dreams. Dreams a God fearing man should never want to have. Dreams of an unholy thing struggling to be born into this world under the branch of an oak in the wilderness. Dreams of the beast ripping itself from the rope and chasing after the men desperately trying to flee in a speeding truck. Visions of a truck sitting in a smoking ruin off of the road, while the beast toyed with the terrified dying men on the dusty road before they took their last ragged breaths in this world.\n\nI came to the next morning surrounded by what had been wrought the night before, and though I would like to say that I felt sorry for those men, I still to this day cannot. Although I take no joy or particular pride in what I had done, or rather, what the thing inside of me had done, I felt no guilt. I left the pieces of those men where they lay, and I drove back to my home wearing a pair of overalls that I had found in their truck. \n\nI knew that it would happen again, and the only way to put a stop to it would be to commit a mortal sin; something that I was not willing to give a ponder. I made a compromise with myself first before I brought it to my God..\n\nAlmost a month before, I had survived an attack by some kind of animal that I never had the benefit of seeing, but after a night at the end of a frayed old rope, it all became clear what that animal was, and the dark gift I had been given. Those awful so-called men were not as fortunate as I had been, of course I still believe that I had someone watching over me. Someone who did not see fit to extend those men the same mercy as was given to me. There had to have been a reason for all of this to have passed, and after a considerable amount of thought and prayer, I finally realized what that reason was.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, most men go through life with not a shred of a sense of purpose. Some men, such as myself, are fortunate enough to find out what that purpose is, even if it‚Äôs to be found in the most awful way. \n\nIt had been a full three months since that hot august night when I was first attacked, that I found myself yet again standing next to  my Fairlane off of an old dirt road in the backcountry. More than two dozen so-called men were standing in a field little more than a hundred yards away from where I was standing. Chubby Checker was quietly coming out of the radio singing about a slow twistin‚Äô, and although I had planned to do some twistin‚Äô myself, I couldn‚Äôt promise that it was going to be slow. \n\nThey were burning a symbol very dear to me in the middle of that field the same way they had burned a church just a few days before. They whooped and hollered as they shot their guns in the air. I remember hoping that some of those boys would save some bullets. I wanted a few of them to have some false hope before they died. They concealed themselves in sheets and pointed hoods to hide what was inside. But I knew what was inside, because I was starting to smell it, and I was getting hungry.\n\nI turned the radio up and they all turned in my direction when I turned on my headlights and shined a light on their wickedness. They seemed confused at first when they saw me, a man calmly removing his clothes and showing off all that color they hated out of ignorance and stupidity.  I smelled their blood pumping and I heard their hearts pounding as they all ran toward me in a murderous rage. I looked up and smiled.\n\nThe full moon that September in 1964 was a beauty.",

        "text": "\n\n_________\n\nThere are times in our life that can define us. Tell us who we are. We go around thinking we know how the world works, and then these moments hit us like a freight train. \n\nSuddenly we realize that we know nothing at all. \n\nThis is one of those instances. And it‚Äôs something that you won‚Äôt be prepared for, no matter how much you think you could be. I thought I was. I thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong. \n\nBut maybe your experience will be different than mine? Maybe you can press your luck. \n\nIf so, listen closely. What follows may save your life, should you see the Wandering Campfire‚Ä¶\n\n________\n\nIt likes the dark. This fact has been confirmed by all eyewitnesses. Some say that it‚Äôs the shadows which attract the flickers of the blaze. Others claim the light of the embers comes first and the darkness follows. One thing is for certain: only at night will you see it. \n\nNot an ordinary night of course, otherwise every Tom, Frank and Harry would see the damned thing. That would be making things easy‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not how it works. It needs to be on the blackest night of the year, the kind of night where you can‚Äôt even see your hand in front of your face without a flashlight. You need to be stumbling. You need to be lost so it can be found. \n\nA map won‚Äôt help you, but going deeper into the woods definitely will. In the forests it can stay hidden, it can trick you. This is its turf, and you‚Äôre just an intruder after all. \n\nSo find a place that makes you feel uneasy. Where there are no signs of life for miles. It may take some time, days perhaps. But then, if you‚Äôre taking this journey you know that what lies ahead isn‚Äôt meant for the faint of heart. Your time is already stolen from you the moment you start to look. \n\nBy then it‚Äôs already too late, once you have passed the last known memories of civilization. You‚Äôll keep going of course, deeper into the forest to listen to nature, but you shouldn‚Äôt expect to come back. \n\nThose that do come back are changed. One woman said she was enlightened. The universe suddenly turned upside down and yet it all made sense, she said. More than it ever had. The unknown is tangible, if but for a moment, but don‚Äôt expect it to suddenly be understood. \n\nExpect only your world to be transformed as well. \n\nI had already seen my fair share of bad luck before I went into the woods that day, having just come out of drug rehab but a week before. The accident had changed me. Rotted my insides and made me bitter. My wife, gone. No longer was I the stable rock she knew. \n\nI needed purpose again. \n\nFind the fire, my best friend Trudy told me. Trudy had been in and out of rehab several times before I showed up, so much so that the staff there called him a regular customer. \n\nWe bonded because we were broken, and I could see glimmers of myself in him. A man that lost everything, struggling to keep going for no reason at all. Trudy admitted that he had tried suicide several times, but the world kept pulling him back. \n\nHe was the one that told me about the wandering campfire, during a therapy session of all places. The interventionist had asked, was there anything in this world that could give him a reason to go on? \n\nTrudy paused, thoughtful. Reflective. There was hurt in his eyes. Like he was trying to suppress an old wound and at the same time, someone was pouring salt into it. \n\nI‚Äôll never forget what he said. \n\nNobody has a reason to go on, not really. We tell ourselves we do and we keep suffering. Life is pain, I‚Äôve accepted that. Death is a release, but it‚Äôs a give and take. You won‚Äôt get that freedom unless you give up everything. And that last bit of suffering‚Ä¶ it can be hard to let it go. Because it‚Äôs final, it‚Äôs absolute. And that is terrifying‚Ä¶ \n\nThen he took a sip of water and I swear no one could hear a pin drop. He had more to say. \n\nThere‚Äôs a story I heard, he said looking at me with dead eyes, about a campfire that moves in the darkest forest on earth. It‚Äôs a legend, probably older than all of us combined but it‚Äôs one that has always stuck with me. This lonesome burning signal, beckoning anyone who dares to come find it. Offering something more freeing than death. \n\nAnd what does it give? I can‚Äôt believe the the staff asked this, maybe they hoped that Trudy would break from the story and realize he was speaking gibberish. Or maybe they were genuinely intrigued. I think that‚Äôs the beauty of it. When you hear about something more exhilarating than life or death. Something unknown is the only force more powerful than that. \n\nHe said he didn‚Äôt know, he never had the guts to go look. Something told him that if he did‚Ä¶ it would be beyond his comprehension to even explain. And that was more terrifying than anything he had ever experienced in life or in death. \n\nAfter the session I pulled him aside. Asking more about the strange wandering fire. Something like that couldn‚Äôt be real? And if it was, what would make it so tantalizing to risk everything for? \n\nTrudy smiled. He knew I was thinking of searching for it, once I was clean. The world is made of more than what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs not. We both know that, he told me. \n\nAnd then he admitted how he really knew about the campfire. He has seen it, in his near death experiences. A flickering blaze that was tugging at his soul. \n\n‚ÄúThe fire could be the end. The end of everything. Or it could be the beginning. We don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he admitted. \n\nAnd I still don‚Äôt, of course. Not even after what I have seen. \n\nThat night when I went, I brought with me supplies for three days. A bedroll, some water, some food, a hunting rifle to scare off wildlife. Nothing that would slow me down. Trudy had told me that once I found it, the chase would be on. The fire would draw me further away from reality and closer to the truth. The closest thing to the truth I would ever experience. \n\nI kept my senses about me at first, I think that‚Äôs part of the way it draws you in. There was nothing about the woods that made me feel comfortable. It had been ages since I actually went for a hike of any kind, not since before my accident. The world hasn‚Äôt felt safe to even dare to explore. And I haven‚Äôt had the energy to consider going out. But the stories of the campfire made me have that desire again. \n\nA reason to keep going. I‚Äôve never been one to believe in ghosts‚Ä¶ never even believed in god. So what made the campfire different? \n\nIt was the way people described their experiences. It felt authentic. It felt real. \n\nI knew some of them were fake, those were easy enough to sift through. When you feel the leaves crunching under your feet and you don‚Äôt know where you are, and the stars and the sky start to all blend together‚Ä¶ there is no faking that. \n\nAnd that was what I was beginning to feel as the night got darker. The forest was closing in. The instructions told me to draw symbols on the forest floor. Not to help me find my home‚Ä¶ but to help the campfire find me. \n\nThe first sign you will get is a smell. Most campfires have an earthy scent to them. Something that makes you feel connected to nature. A soothing aroma that makes you feel comfortable. \n\nWhen you stand in the darkness and you etch those ancient runes in the dark, you aren‚Äôt inviting anything that could be remotely considered pleasant. \n\nThe smell will hit you the same way you feel when you have seen a dead body, animal or human, making you want to turn your head and vomit. I made the mistake of eating before I even left the roads, so as it wafted over me I began to hurl up my guts. Feeling dizzy and faint, I could hardly keep myself standing. The world was spinning and I felt that I was going to fall off. \n\nThis can last a few minutes or even a few hours but the important thing is to go toward the smell. That repugnant odor is the only evidence you have so far that will connect you to the beyond. It‚Äôs the first step to recognizing this reality you experience isn‚Äôt so easily understood. \n\nAs you keep moving, your first encounter with the campfire will be the most difficult. You‚Äôll see a flicker of fire that is gently nudging itself in and out of the darkness. Between the trees it‚Äôs hardly visible at all, and you may tell yourself that your eyes are playing tricks on you.\nBecause it will seem as though each time you look away, the campfire will move. \n\nThe key is to stay focused. No matter how much your eyes burn, or how difficult it will feel to walk. \n\nYour legs will be heavy. Your hands might be numb. \n\nBut it will be a black hole drawing you toward it. The closer you get the faster it will come to you. \n\nThere will be something different for everyone at that first sighting. But there will always be a place to sit down. The fire will fill you with anxiety as you get close. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stick up as I stood there, facing it and realizing that the legends were all real. \n\nPart of me wanted to turn and run away. How far would it take me to return to the real world? An hour? A day? Could I ever return at all? \n\nThe mesmerizing flames told me that it wouldn‚Äôt be possible. Instead I would need to wait and watch and see where the campfire took me. \n\nMy journey into the beyond was starting here. \n\nYou must offer the campfire something that you can‚Äôt afford to lose. That is a part of the ritual that never waivers. It can be anything that was a part of your life. Perhaps an important item given to you by a loved one. Something that you didn‚Äôt want to leave behind. A picture or a piece of jewelry. The instructions tell you that if the offering isn‚Äôt good enough, the campfire will simply diffuse and the forest will return. You only get one chance. \n\nI didn‚Äôt want to risk losing this opportunity. \n\nI took out the Swiss Army knife and held my hand near the log that was closest to the fire. The blade touched my ring finger and I closed my eyes, wondering if it would make any sense to even pray. \n\nI pressed down as hard as I could, blood spilling out as flesh was torn away. The blade made a quick cut, it was final and couldn‚Äôt be taken back. The finger was severed from my body. At the same time I pressed my bleeding hand toward my jacket, trying to hold back a scream. \n\nThis was my offering and I knew the fire would realize it‚Äôs meaning, because attached to the flesh was my last memory of my wife. That golden ring that I vowed to keep no matter what. \nMy last tangible connection to this world and my first big step to the world beyond. \n\nThe bleeding was still throbbing through my body as I picked up the raggedly piece of flesh and tossed it into the fire. \n\nThe inferno blazed up, clouding my vision as I covered my eyes instinctively. \n\nThen the fire began to move. It had accepted the finger and was taking me somewhere else. \n\nI had only but a moment to grab my things and rush through the woods toward it.\n\nI wish I had hesitated. I wish I hadn‚Äôt taken this insane journey. But I knew there was no turning back, more so than ever before. \n\nPast the point of no return, the wandering campfire was guiding me to the ultimate truth of existence. And I was dragged toward it like a fish with a hook in its mouth. \n\nAs you move forward, it will feel as though you have gone nowhere. Have you ever driven through a long dark tunnel? The kind that shows a glimmer of light but the walls blend together over and over as you go further down it? \n\nThis is what the forest will do to you. The trees will seemingly push themselves apart and then fall back into place as the campfire moves. At first it will be a gentle flow, the ground itself won‚Äôt move, or at least it won‚Äôt seem to. The closest way to describe it is walking on a treadmill. You go down that same path over and over, a carrot dangling in your face that tells you that you will reach the finish line. And yet each step you make toward the campfire, it‚Äôs a little further away. \n\nThen the fire will start to feel further away. Again, nothing will change around you but as you begin to walk toward it, it may feel as though the forest is going in reverse. Except every part of you knows that you are going forward. Trying to reach for that inescapable feeling of purpose that it is tantalizingly offering to you. And then the forest will continue to fall away, the trees, the sky, the stars. Eventually nothing will be left except for the campfire itself. The darkness of the ground will make you think that you are falling. And you can‚Äôt stop it now. It‚Äôs rushing toward you again, and you feel that you are going to fall into the blaze. \n\nFinally, you are exactly where this force of nature wants you. The fire is larger now, almost as if it‚Äôs encompassing the entire forest. \n\nAnd then you will need to sit and wait. There is nothing to sit on of course, only darkness. You must close your eyes and trust that you don‚Äôt fall. The rest will happen automatically. You will feel that you are sitting in a cold hard chair, and the fire will flicker and invite you to touch it. \n\nThere won‚Äôt be any warmth. You will feel colder than you have ever felt in your entire life. This sense of dread will wash over you. \n\nAnd you will feel that you are constantly waiting for something. All sense of time, night and day or anything you once were clinging to us is going to be gone. \n\nThen, across the fire‚Ä¶ you will see a figure. \nA darkness that stands tall and silently across the fire, an evil that you know is from beyond any hell you could ever conjure up. \n\nI felt something heavy on my chest, a hot coal burning my skin. I couldn‚Äôt speak and I knew that the instructions told me I shouldn‚Äôt. This was time to listen. The shadow would do the talking. \nIt uttered my name first, as it seemed to sit down. I numbly nodded, a breath of icy air hitting my bones. \n\n‚ÄúDo you understand where you are?‚Äù it asked. \n\nI couldn‚Äôt help but to be surprised. It was offering me the chance to answer. Something I was sure I wasn‚Äôt supposed to do. Instead I kept quiet as it repeated the question several times, until at last it became angry and tossed embers toward my face. \n\n‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know; then what brought you here?‚Äù \n\nThe fires hit me and I instinctively screamed. I thought that moment was my last in this life, instead the shadow simply lingered. Waiting for me to actually tell my story. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I was in an accident‚Ä¶ about 18 months ago,‚Äù I said, hardly recognizing my own voice. Was I really doing the talking or was it still the shadow? It felt as though we both shared the same resonance in that moment. \n\n‚ÄúMy wife and I‚Ä¶ we were‚Ä¶ going to this function. It was a horrible storm. I told her we shouldn‚Äôt go. She insisted that it mattered. But the ice on the road‚Ä¶ black ice. I couldn‚Äôt see it. I hit it hard and my reflexes got the better of me‚Ä¶ The car tumbled end over end down the highway. We collided with four other cars. I felt everything. The intense pain shook through my body, and it kept me awake as I saw bodies piling up around me‚Ä¶.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEight cars‚Ä¶ at least thirteen dead. Several children included‚Ä¶. Along with my wife. The news called it the worst accident in the history of the state in the past ten years. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true. But‚Ä¶ I died that day. I saw everything that I ever loved taken from me and I was one of the few still standing. One of the few that crawled out with hardly anything but bruises‚Ä¶.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúPeople told me it was God, a miracle to help me appreciate life. I turned to drugs. I turned to suicide. But none of it has left me satisfied. I don‚Äôt believe any of those answers. I think I had to come here‚Ä¶ to find this fire‚Ä¶ to see the beyond‚Ä¶ so that I could understand‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\nAs I finished my story, silence loomed between us. The figure stood there, staring either at me or the campfire; saying nothing. Was it trying to determine if I should live or if I should die? I wanted my suffering to end. I wanted absolution. \n\nInstead, a cold dead laugh rumbled through the darkness. \n\nIt made me feel like nothing. \n\nIt made me suddenly aware that my suffering, my very existence was meaningless. In the grand universe, my problems, my heartbreak‚Ä¶ it would all be eventually consumed by a fire much like the one sitting in front of me. \n\n‚ÄúNothingness is eternal, misery and pain are life, and endlessness is the only absolute serenity that anyone can obtain. When you kept living, you thought it meant you had purpose. You thought it might mean your life would have a reason. But no life does. Nothing does. Existence is chaos,‚Äù the shadow told me as it grew taller. Long slender arms reached up and beyond the view of the fire, like a spider's legs reaching for a prone fly that was caught in a web. \n\nThen those arms morphed into claws, razor sharp tendrils that began to snake their way toward me. \n\n‚ÄúLet me offer you the freedom of nonexistence,‚Äù the shadow rumbled as the entire forest began to push its way back toward us. It felt that I was being swallowed whole by the woods. \n\nThe trees were melting into twisted and rotten flesh, sliding down to the ground and becoming blackened burnt fingers that were reaching to drag me to the inferno. \n\nThe branches snapped and turned toward me, the hollow wood morphing into faces of people that I had hurt. That I had harmed. All snarling and snapping their jagged teeth toward me. \n\nSuddenly I felt the urge to run. To live. No matter the moment of suffering that I was enduring, I couldn‚Äôt end my life here. \n\nThe reflection of my wife‚Äôs face came into the campfire. Her soft eyes urged me to action. Then those same comfortable eyes turned dead, color drained. This was the end of everything. This was all that the campfire would ever offer me. \n\nIt was all that anyone could ever grasp or understand. \n\nThe shadow was covering the entire sky, it‚Äôs laughter echoing throughout the forest. Sharp spikes rippled across the floor, and the canopy became filled with falling knives. My back was torn to ribbons. My running soon became a crawl. I was falling into the earth, into this eternal wandering blaze. \n\nAll it wanted was my suffering to fuel the flame. \n\nMy legs hit the fire, scarring my back ankles and feet first as I screamed and fought. The shadow kept lurching forward, towering over me as molten fire dripped onto my face. \n\nThis is what I wanted, to suffer for my life. To pay for what I felt was my fault. But was this hell my freedom? Was my life null and void? \n\nSomething stirred deep inside me and I pushed my way toward the flame even further. I recognized this was the sacrifice I should have offered. My very soul. Only then would I get the absolution I sought. \n\nFlames engulfed my body as I struggled to cover my eyes. The campfire grew larger and the laughter was covered over by the roaring fire. \n\nI was falling, deeper to the depths of darkness that would melt away all of reality. Then I was rising, pushed up back to the ground. Spitting and sputtering like a newborn, I was hardly able to move as the fire disappeared and my charred and blackened body lay prone on the forest floor. \n\nI was dead. I felt nothing. I was nothing. And then, I was opening my eyes and looking at my beautiful wife. \n\nShe looked so much younger, so kind and caring. She was standing at the campfire. About to jump in. And she was telling me that it was going to be okay. \n\nMove on, she said. Live and love. That was what my existence needed to be. I promised her I would. I promised I would make sense of the chaos that we are given. \n\nThen the forest sky came back, the lonesome woods. I lay there for days maybe before other hikers found me. They didn't even know if I was still human. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt anymore. \n\nI was taken to heal, but part of me has stayed there even now. I still feel the fire everywhere I go. It burns inside me. My soul is part of this eternal endless chaos. It is consuming others, giving them a peek into the unknown. \n\nI saw it there, beyond death. This endless madness that will devour us all. It was waiting in the fire. It was in the shadow and it is now inside me. For I am death, walking on this earth and carrying the fire where I go. Sharing my experience to others who hunger for that freedom. Enticing them to seek out the unknown. \n\nThe campfire will grow, it will always move and make use of the weak and the fragile. \n\nBut most importantly of all. It will burn. \n\nIt will burn the world. \n\n[330](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)",

        "text": "The screaming from my basement kept me up at night. The women I had kidnapped and chained down there often wept or yelled until dawn, and I knew things couldn‚Äôt continue like this. They were disturbing my sleep, making my life intolerable, and that made me furious to the point where my vision turned white with rage every time they woke me up. I would go beat and torture them any time that happened, but they still kept screaming, and I knew I would have to find a better way to immobilize them.\n\nI had originally bought barbiturates, benzos and fentanyl off the dark web. I also bought medical supplies like plastic tubing as well as machinery to titrate IV drugs. After a few experiments gone wrong where I accidentally overdosed a couple of them and had to administer Narcan, I found I could keep them incapacitated with a very low dose of fentanyl combined with high doses of IV benzodiazepines. But then my dark web connection disappeared, likely busted by the DEA or FBI, and I knew I had to find another way.\n\nI read about legal drugs, and one of them caught my eye. It was a red-and-white mushroom by the name of Amanita muscaria, commonly called ‚Äúfly agaric‚Äù, a mushroom that appeared in pop culture references from the Smurfs to Alice in Wonderland to Super Mario Brothers, but one that almost no one realized was psychoactive and totally legal. It had incapacitating effects, often causing out-of-body experiences and catatonic states.\n\n‚ÄúThis is peeeeerfect,‚Äù I said to myself, smiling and feeling elated. I immediately ordered some Siberian fly agaric, and as soon as it came in the next day, I started extracting the active ingredients and diluting them in distilled water for placement in the IV bag.\n\nAs I went out to check the mail, I saw a male about my height far away in the forest, running away in a panic from something behind him, something that appeared to drag itself forward at an amazingly fast speed on its arms, yet had no legs. But when I turned to look at it directly, they had disappeared into the thick brush. I had no neighbors, the nearest one being over a mile away in the other direction, so I wondered who would be out here. \n\nI lit a cigarette and stayed on my porch, watching and waiting, but after no more sightings or noises came, I gave up and went back inside.\n\nWhistling to myself, I brought the IV bags down to the basement. The three women I kept there were currently all quiet, likely either asleep or just staring blankly up at the ceiling. They were all naked, chained to the gurneys. I only unchained them when they needed to use the bathroom or eat, but then I would immediately chain them back up again. It pleased me to be able to come down and torture or rape them any time I felt like it, as if they were my own puppets without any individual soul or consciousness left. They were all beautiful with blue eyes and blonde hair parted in the middle, lithe bodies and very light, Irish skin.\n\nI walked down the creaking cellar stairs, moving next to my nearest victim. I didn‚Äôt usually bother to learn their names, but this one was a hitchhiker and had told me when I picked her up. She said her name was Ally and that she was a college student. She was beautiful and young, at least before I started slicing her up. Now she had countless cuts all over her skin. I had poured bleach into the wounds to make her scream louder and increase my own sadistic pleasure. She slept when I started hanging the new IV solution of fly agaric up to the medical pole next to her bed.\n\nAs the fluid began to drip through the clear plastic tubing, she woke up. Her deep blue eyes regarded me with hatred for a moment, then she turned away, not saying anything. Her face had a look of hopelessness and despair on it that I had seen dozens of times before. Whenever any of my victims neared the end of their lives, that kind of vacant hopeless stare was all that was left on their faces, sometimes accompanied by tremendous pain and fear, sometimes accompanied by acceptance and peace.\n\nWhistling to myself, I began to walk around the room, checking the other two women for infections, making sure their chains were tight and that they were still alive. I was about to grab the padlock key to unchain them one at a time, letting them use the bathroom and get some food and water quickly so I could keep them alive longer, but then something started to happen from underneath Ally‚Äôs bed.\n\nI heard a deep growling sound. Spinning around, I saw Ally‚Äôs pupils had expanded to cover her entire iris. Her eyes were staring blankly past me with a thousand-yard stare, and the room seemed to shimmer and glow around her. Underneath her bed, I saw a face with dozens of glowing white eyes staring out at me from the shadows. I backed up slowly, reaching into my pocket for the switchblade I always carried on me. It used its front limbs to crawl out, leaving a trail of reeking blood behind it and filling the room with the smell of iron and rot.\n\nThe monstrosity looked like it was rotting from the inside. Its skin fell off in fetid bluish-purple layers, its mouth was full of rotten black teeth embedded in sickly brown gums, but its dozens of eyes were what truly caught my attention. They were all blue, just like the eyes of my victims. Some were icy blue, like an Alaskan lake, while others were the deep blue of a tropical ocean. To my horror, I could even recognize some of the eyes and which of my previous victims they had belonged to.\n\nIt dragged itself forward at a tremendous speed using its arms, with exposed muscle and bone showing through the worn, decaying layers of maggot-infested skin that covered them. It had no legs, but only bleeding stumps that left two thick trails of blood behind it on the floor. It had no clothes on, but the decay and constant squirming of maggots and insects in its body gave it a unique covering all its own.\n\n‚ÄúYou can run,‚Äù it said to me with dozens of overlapping, harsh voices, ‚Äúbut I know you better than you know yourself. You think you are evil, but the true evil is coming that will tear you to pieces. Run!‚Äù The last word was so loud that the entire cellar shook, sending clouds of dirt falling down from the ceiling, and I turned and ran up the stairs. I heard a rapid scuttling, dragging sound as the monster behind me gave chase.\n\n‚ÄúAh oh no oh shit oh no,‚Äù I said to myself quickly as I ran right through the cellar door, not even stopping. It slammed against the wall, shutting itself again from the impact as I passed by. I ran out into the kitchen and towards the front door, which I always kept locked with two deadbolts as well as a knob that locked. I was serious about my security, but right now it was working against me. My shaking fingers quickly undid the two deadbolts as I heard the monster break through the cellar door,\n\n‚ÄúJaaacckk‚Ä¶‚Äù it said to me, dragging my name out as it slid on its belly behind me. I had just gotten to the last lock, the turnkey on the doorknob, when I felt it grab my leg. I kicked back as hard as I could, smashing the bottom of my steel-toe boot directly into its face through pure luck, and felt the knob turn suddenly. I flung the door open, but just as I was running through it, I felt myself pulled back by the grasping arms of the eldritch monstrosity behind me. It spun me around to stare into its rotting face. I felt like I could do nothing for a moment but look into those countless eyes. Then, with a superhuman speed beyond my vision, it rapidly bit my right thumb off with its blackened teeth.\n\nFor a moment, there was no pain, just shock. I stared down at my spurting hand, the blood soaking into my white shirt, then a fiery burning sensation shot up my arm. Screaming and thrashing, I fell back through the door, kicking with all my might at the thing‚Äôs eyes and face. But though I made contact over and over, it just started laughing, a demonic and deep sound that rattled the windows and doors of the house.\n\nLaying flat out on my back on the porch, I began to scoot backwards as fast as I could while it came towards me. Fumbling in my pocket, I found the key for the deadbolt I kept on the basement door, pulled it out, and unthinkingly shoved the piece of metal into the center of its eyes. It made a direct hit into one of them, sending warm vitreous fluid covered with squirming maggots shooting out onto my left hand. The smell was so pungent and the sensation of the insects so horrifying that I started to gag. But it bought me enough time to push myself up and begin sprinting into the woods. I held my mutilated hand with my good one, wrapping the cloth of my shirt around it to try to slow the bleeding. I knew if it kept spurting like it was, I would begin to lose consciousness from the blood loss, then that *thing* would have me.\n\nThe daylight was growing soft and weak as the sun set, but it was enough to see the brushes and brambles as I ran blindly ahead. After a couple minutes, I came into a clearing, where I saw myself standing in the center of the field. I stopped suddenly, looking behind me for the creature, but there was no sign of it. Then I turned back to *me* and started moving forwards.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this?‚Äù I asked loudly. My doppelganger only smiled at me.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made a huge mistake, Jack,‚Äù he said. \n\n‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm you, obviously. Look!‚Äù He raised his bandaged right hand, the strips of a white shirt wrapped tightly around the dismembered thumb.\n\n‚ÄúHow is this happening?‚Äù I felt like I was about to wake up at any moment, as if I were trapped in a nightmare.\n\n‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt do enough research into that drug you gave the young woman,‚Äù he said to me. ‚ÄúNot only did you accidentally kidnap and torture a *psychic* who has supernatural powers, but then you gave her a drug that causes time-loops and out-of-body experiences. Her mind is so powerful that it is disrupting the flow of space and time all around us. You are caught in the same loop now that she is subjected to inside of her nightmare state.‚Äù I shook my head.\n\n‚ÄúThat sounds totally impossible,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as psychics.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBefore today,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe also thought there was no such thing as monsters. Yet didn‚Äôt you see the one who bit off our thumb? It had the eyes of every girl we‚Äôve killed. She has recruited their spirits and pieces of their decomposing bodies to reform into a vessel for justice. You‚Äôre being hunted, and you don‚Äôt have much time. You have to listen to me and stop asking questions.‚Äù I nodded at him, and he went on.\n\n‚ÄúYour only chance now is to run out the clock. That drug, the fly agaric mushroom, only has enough active chemicals in that one bag to keep Ally in a time-loop for twenty or twenty-five hours, depending on how fast the drug begins to wear off when the IV bag is depleted. If you can survive the entire time, you might be able to make it out of this alive. Her powers should start to fade back to normal once the drug has dissipated‚Ä¶‚Äù He turned, looking. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù\n\nI was about to respond, saying that I didn‚Äôt hear anything, but then I realized I did hear something. It sounded almost subaudible, like the tremors of an earthquake deep underground just out of the reach of human hearing, but as I listened, it grew louder and the ground started to shake. Thousands of black, rotted hands began to reach out of the ground, sprouting from the forest clearing like rows and rows of corn stalks, and I screamed in terror.\n\nI was much closer to the forest than my doppelganger, so I began to back away rapidly. Some of the hands grabbed at my jeans and shoes, and I lost one shoe in the process of escaping, but within a few seconds I was back under the cover of the trees. My doppelganger wasn‚Äôt so lucky.\n\nHe tried fighting, kicking at the nearest hands and pulling a switchblade from his pocket, which he used to begin stabbing and slicing at the dozens of hands that now grabbed his legs, feet and torso. I saw black liquid dripping from the slices he made, but the hands were totally unaffected. They began to return to the earth, dragging him down with them. He shot me one final, terrified glance before he disappeared beneath the ground.\n\n‚ÄúFound you!‚Äù a monstrous gurgling said from behind me. I turned around and saw the monster there, one of its eyes deflated and still dripping, its mouth opened in a grin that stretched across its face like a Glasgow smile, its cheeks ripping open from one corner of its face to the other as its grin kept widening.\n\n‚ÄúPlease, leave me alone!‚Äù I said, using my good hand to pull my switchblade out of my pocket. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt you, but I will if I have to. I have no fight with you.‚Äù The thing laughed, a deep and disturbing sound that echoed through the rapidly darkening forest.\n\n‚ÄúYou killed me, over and over,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúand now I come to repay the favor. A life for a life, the ancients said, but your debt is overdue. You have only one life to trade, so I‚Äôm going to make this fun for us. You can have a sixty-second head start.‚Äù\n\nI turned around and sprinted blindly across the forest, until I eventually found an abandoned shack. I took out my phone and tried calling for help. I called 911, but the only voice that came through was the voice of the monster, gurgling and laughing.\n\nThe internet worked, so I began to write up my story. I know I can‚Äôt survive for twenty hours. I‚Äôve seen myself die already. These things are just toying with me before they finish me off for good.\n\nI just wanted the world to know what happened to me, though. Maybe I do deserve to die, but at least I can give others a warning.\n\nStay away from the fly agaric mushroom.",

        "text": "‚ÄúAnd there you have it,‚Äù I said to the blonde woman behind me. I could feel her gun pointed at the back of my skull. ‚ÄúNow we both have unspeakable secrets to hold over one another.‚Äù I wiped my face, inadvertently smearing the man‚Äôs blood across my lips. ‚Äú[Is that enough to let me live](https://redd.it/10ngbrz)?‚Äù\n\nI wish I could have said that I stood with dignity as she decided my fate, staring stoically into a space where entire galaxies rise and fall without our awareness. Barring that, I would have liked say that I held a newfound appreciation for a life after coming face-to-face with my own mortality, enlightened with the knowledge of just how precious and fleeting existence truly is. \n\nBut all I could think about was the mouthfoam and twitching and shitting the man before me had gone through before collapsing into an undignified puddle that was rapidly approaching room temperature. I knew it was shitty of me, but all I cared about was ensuring that I didn‚Äôt sink so low. \n\nI took in halting breaths, wondering if a bullet against my skull would feel more like a wasp or a crowbar, pissing just a little, trying to prevent it from being a lot. My nose ran freely. \n\nAfter a few seconds, I was willing to take any sort of resolution, provided I didn‚Äôt have to continue waiting. \n\nBut I was too much of a coward to move.\n\nThe blonde woman sighed. Without looking behind me, I felt her relax. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she breathed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve at least earned a reprieve for the amount of time it takes to walk outside.‚Äù\n\nMy breath shuttered as my nose and bladder released a little more. \n\nI struggled to speak.\n\n‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got something to say, out with it,‚Äù she groaned, the tension rising. \n\nFearing the silence, I forced myself to talk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost funny‚Ä¶ Santa‚Äôs been gone for a while now, but I think ‚Äì um ‚Äì I think that *this* is the scariest part.‚Äù I turned around.\n\nI recognized the look in her face then: she was just as afraid of me as I was of her. Nothing is so terrifying as what a normal person can become.\n\nSide by side, we walked through the sticky mess of blood, hair, and viscera that used to be our three companions. \n\nShe opened the door, and we stepped into the world.\n\nThe sun was shining despite the fact that I felt like it had no right to do so. I blinked, trying to understand why I was seeing something familiar. A sign above the exit door read ‚Äú1913 xxxx Street.‚Äù I looked behind me and saw the familiar landscape of Garfield Park.\n\nMy house was just three blocks away. \n\n‚ÄúThis is my home,‚Äù the blonde woman offered in a weaker voice than I‚Äôd thought possible. ‚ÄúI live in that apartment.‚Äù\n\nDiscomfort curdled in my stomach as I realized that all five of us had probably resided nearby. Dirty Santa wanted us to suffer close to home.\n\nAnd so we faced a split path. The cloudless sky was the brightest I‚Äôd seen it after a week of slate-gray clouds. It was exactly the sort of thing I‚Äôd taken for granted when it was easier to look down and get pissed at an untied shoe or a flat tire, because we focus on the transient at the expense of any bigger picture. Three people would never again experience a bright blue sky, while I had decades of them before me, even if it would never look quite the same. In the end, it was the mundane things I feared losing most when I made the decision to take a man‚Äôs life in the hopes of sparing my own.\n\n‚ÄúThis moment,‚Äù I responded in a trembling voice, ‚Äúis everything. After that experience, we‚Äôll never see life the same way again. We‚Äôll take this with us for as long as we live.‚Äù I ran a hand through my hair with shaking fingers.\n\nShe looked at me without blinking. Concrete silence stiffened between us. \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù she answered.\n\nAdrenaline flared in my stomach as she flexed the hand that still held a pistol.\n\nThen she raised the barrel to her temple and pulled the trigger.\n\nFor the fourth time in an hour, I witnessed a death that was far less dignified than I would have believed. Her jaw flapped, one leg jittered, and more blood poured from her skull crater than I thought a person could hold. She foamed at the mouth and vomited while pissing and shitting. \n\nThe kids in the park screamed. I marveled, distantly, at the years of therapy that would inevitably spawn from this brief moment. We suffer because we want to believe that life isn‚Äôt fragile. \n\nThe blonde woman‚Äôs eyes stayed open the whole time. When they finished twitching, they were staring at me.\n\n-------\n\n\nThe police said that I was lucky to be the only one of five who lived. \n\nBut Santa also lived, and he got everything he wanted. I suppose he was the luckiest of all. They have no realistic hope of finding him. \n\nThe District Attorney told me that she won‚Äôt prosecute me for the man I killed. But his sister screamed that she‚Äôll never forgive me, that I‚Äôll never put this behind me, and she‚Äôll never be whole again. \n\nIn the end, we gave Dirty Santa everything he wanted: we killed each other and ourselves. He did very little compared to our own actions. I doubt he even had a gun. Our phones and means of escape were with us the entire time.\n\nI wanted *so badly* to live. \n\nWhich forced me to ask myself why.\n\nI found the answer: the life I had before this guilt was pretty good. Not great, but certainly worth appreciating. I‚Äôll never, ever have it again. Everything will be different until I die. No amount of drugs or therapy will erase it.\n\nSo I‚Äôm giving the man‚Äôs sister her wish. I can‚Äôt live with the guilt of being a murderer. I‚Äôm going to post this and then kill myself. I think I‚Äôll use a knife in my throat. \n\nI deserve it.\n\nGoodbye.\n\n----------------\n\n [FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

But little was my notion, that when we parted by the ocean, that we were forever parted by the banks of the lee...\"***\n\n**-- Silly Wizard,** ***Banks of the Lee***\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"Flight 249 now boarding, I repeat, Flight 249 now boarding!\"**\n\nMy head snapped up from my phone to look at the overhead screen. Sure enough, there was the numbers to my flight. Flight 249, One way to Scotland. This was it.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I picked up my bags and began walking to the terminal, walking toward the metaphorical gateway to my new life. I looked back one last time behind me, taking one last look at what I was soon to be leaving behind. For a moment, I was actually hesitant to go the rest of the way through the terminal.\n\n*There's nothing for you here, Rick.* I reminded myself before taking another deep breath. *She's gone now. They both are.* I took a moment to let one or two stray tears fall down my face before facing forward and walking through the terminal. I quietly found a seat and made myself comfortable.\n\nStrangely, I can remember just how quiet it was while the flight was boarding. People stepped onto the plane, disregarding each other for the most part. Everyone had this cold, lifeless look on their faces, like they, too, were trying to just get the hell out of town the same way I was. It was about another half hour before the announcement came over the loudspeaker. That I think if it, I don't remember at any point hearing any of the cabin attendants going over safety procedures or anything, though, I admittedly wasn't paying much attention to much once I'd sat down, having put my earbuds in and turned on my ASMR app.\n\nI was exhausted, having prepared for this trip for at least a week straight. I couldn't sleep at all through that week, nor do I think any of you would've been able to either if every time you closed your eyes, you had the same nightmare. If every time you laid down at night, you saw the face of your loved one be engulfed in fire, screaming out to you to save them, before having her flesh seared from her bones, would you be able to sleep peacefully?\n\nTo this day, I still wonder how the hell I didn't lose my mind long before all this went down. Being perfectly honest, I should've gone mad when it all happened, especially given just how little of what happened that I understood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was two years ago that Irene and I had decided to go to the mountains for our 3 year anniversary. The two of us were a couple of sweethearts since college and I even proposed to her at our graduation party. Since then, we had been a happy little pair of lovebirds until that day.\n\nLike I said, I can't really describe much of what happened in any comprehensible way. So much happened so quickly. I remember me and her were hiking about three quarters of the way up the mountain when we stopped, having to rest our legs. Panting, I remarked to her, \"Jeez, you'd think after all that time doing track, we'd have made it a little further, huh?\"\n\n\"Says you,\" she replied, scoffing. She made her voice try to go deep to sound like me, saying, *\"Oh hon, can we PLEASE stop, I gotta rest my legs.\"*\n\n\"I said that cause you were draggin' ass behind me, slowpoke.\" She smirked, flipped me off, and delivered a punch to the shoulder for my smart ass mouth. I laughed and said, \"You call that a punch? Come on, mama, I know you can hit harder than *that*.\" She snickered before stiffening her upper lip into a defiant smirk and trying to hit me again. This time, I caught her wrists and trapped them in a criss-cross, holding her still. She struggled against me for a second before conceding.\n\nSighing, she said, \"Okay, babe, you win. You're the strongest. And the handsomest.\" She said this last part with a wink and a sly grin parting the corner of her mouth. I almost didn't even notice though, having lost myself in her eyes; those ember red jewels that sat peacefully in the middle of two oceans of midnight seas, burning right through my eyes, through my mind, and straight through to my heart and soul every time I stared into them. For a moment, the only sound around the two of us, the only signs of life from around us, was the singular sound of the breeze whipping our hair and the clothes on our backs.\n\n\"What?\" she asked. I shook my head, blinking.\n\n\"Huh?\" I asked.\n\n\"Can I go now, officer?\" she joked, her grin growing amused again. I looked down to see I still had her wrists. I chuckled nervously, releasing her wrists.\n\n\"Sorry about that. Just... kinda lost myself there for a sec.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Her sly grin returned. \"You tryin' to say you like playin' rough?\" She giggled and winked. I chuckled.\n\n\"No just... God, have I told you that you have the prettiest eyes in the world?\"\n\nShe snickered and replied, \"A million times, actually; 3,000 just today.\" I smiled.\n\n\"And I'll happily tell you a million times more.\" After that, the silence pervaded the trail around us. The only sounds of life around us was the early autumn breeze whipping our hair and the clothes on our backs. Gradually, almost unconsciously, our bodies came closer and closer to one another until eventually, our eyes closed and our lips met. We stayed locked on each other's embrace for a whole 25 seconds, the heat of the moment actually drowning out the chill of the wind pricking our bodies. I'd like to say that we'd have never separated, had it not been for the fact that I could feel the heat intensify from her body.\n\nIt was a whole five seconds before I opened my eyes, doing so only after I felt Irene's hands jerk away from my body like she was in a hurry to get away from me. When I did open my eyes, I saw Irene looking horrified at her hands. \"Irene?\" I asked, feeling my heart rate jump from 0 to 10,000 in that half a second time span. \"Baby, what's wrong?\"\n\nShe looked at me, opening her mouth to speak, only to get cut off by a sharp cry of pain that had her doubling over, clutching her stomach. \"Irene!\" I reached out to her, but instantly retracted when I saw her body beginning to glow. She cried out in pain, her body glowing brighter and brighter. I began to feel heat, *intense* heat, like her body in itself was an exploding star, emitting from her body that I even saw beginning to singe the hair from my arms.\n\nThe brighter her body glowed, the harder it became for me to be able to see her. I shouted, \"Irene!\" For a brief moment, I saw her eyes stare back at me, wide and afraid.\n\n\"Richard!\" she cried. When I reached for her again, a searing pain ran across my arm and when I pulled it back, I saw the skin beginning to blister. Before I could try again, to do *anything*, her body released a sort of shockwave of blinding light that coupled with a scorching blaze of heat that made me almost swear for a moment that I was on fire. I was forced to shield my eyes and when I opened them again, I was alone.\n\nI looked all around. Nothing. \"I-Ir-Irene?\" My head swung furiously all around. \"Irene! IRENE!\"\n\nThere was no answer, from anywhere. My head stopped swinging when I looked down at where she was standing. Right there, in front of me, in place of my beautiful wife, was a large black spot where I could see small wafts of smoke jumping from it to pollute the sky. At that moment, I dropped to my knees and began screaming Irene's name deliriously. I'd have sworn I was there for next to an eternity, having continued my howling until my throat tore itself in half (not even much of an exaggeration, either, judging from the doctor's visit I had to take later on because of it), but at some point, a couple walking by found me and asked me what was wrong.\n\nI'll say two things; first, bless them for actually giving enough of a damn to stop and want to even *try* listening to some howling stranger who no doubt scared the hell out of them with his racket, and second, if they *were* able to understand a damn bit of the inane gibberish I was spewing at them, then they deserve an award of some sort. I tried my best to tell them, in one way or another, that my wife was missing.\n\nThey helped me down and off the mountain -- by which I really mean they more or less dragged me away from the black, smoldering remains of my wife, kicking and screaming like a lunatic (Like I said, bless them) -- and escorted me to the nearest police station. From there, it was more or less the same situation, with me trying to explain something to them that I didn't understand while having no composure whatsoever. Long story short, they told me to go home and that they'd search for her. Told me they'd find her...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI started awake on the plane. For a moment, my head swiveled around the cabin. *IRENE?!*\n\nEverything was still quiet. Everyone was still, facing forward, either with their heads down, likely on their phones or something, or just staring blankly at the cockpit. I relaxed once more in my seat.\n\n*She's gone Rick...*\n\nI looked out of the window to my right. The sky was a perfect shade of blue, the kind of shade you don't normally see unless you're right there in it, swimming or at least floating in it. Unless it's all around you, in a way that's achievable only when you're 50,000 feet in the air, on a plane...\n\nOr on a mountainside...\n\nI shook my head, turning away from the window. *It's been two goddamn years. She's gone, she ain't coming back.* Readjusting myself in my chair, I refixed my earbuds and restarted the app. In seconds, I was once again in sleep's numbing embrace. images of the perfect blue sky, of Irene, were soo quite literally drowned out by those of gray, cloudy skies, unleashing a torrential downpour upon stone cold earth. It was the perfect diversion. Anodyne, of you will, allowing me to completely forget about Irene. Forget about my old life. Forget that I was alone...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"I have your heart, so long as it beats, Ricky-boy...\" she said, giggling. She sat on my lap as I laid across my old, torn up couch, straddling me, wearing her sports bra and leggings. She'd just gotten home from Yoga practice. She'd hopped on me as soon as she'd walked through the door.\n\nShe was smiling down at me, causing me to lose myself in her eyes. She ran her fingers along my chest, slowly running them along so I'll feel every soft inch of them as she went. \"Well, I'm glad to see you home, too, babe.\" I replied, chuckling. She giggled her adorable little girlish giggle; a giggle who's sound is matched by the giggle of a baby, before leaning down to touch her nose to mine. \"What's the occasion?\" I asked, grinning.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she replied with her own smile widening.\n\n\"You're awfully cheery this afternoon. Usually, you're tired after yoga practice. What, did you have a little extra something in your shake today?\" She laughed, throwing your head back.\n\n\"Maybe a *little* bit...\" she replied with a joking sense of guilt, giving me the look a child gives when they're caught eating glue paste.\n\n\"A little bit, huh?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh...\"\n\n\"God, you're adorable, you know that?\"\n\n\"Like you'll ever let me forget.\" she joked. \"And you're such a little goof, you know that?\"\n\nI winked, \"Like you'd ever let me forget.\" Her grin stretched from one ear to the other as she gave me a peck on the nose before laying her head down on my chest, nuzzling her head directly in the center of my pecs. Looking down at her, with the rays of the afternoon sun just ever so gently stroking her face the same way her fingers so tenderly caressed my chest, giving her an almost blazing aura that I could actually detect the heat from, I told myself, *Yep, Ricky-boy, you really are the luckiest man alive. Despite the rinky-dink apartment, long, exhausting -- though decently paying -- job, and whatever bullshit you carry around with you in your day to day life, you have this angel on your chest, and she happily holds your heart.*\n\nThe heat radiating from her began getting to me more and more. I noticed beads of sweat forming on my forehead. I began looking around the room, looking for the thermostat. Her head raised up again to look me in the eyes. \"Baby, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Huh? Oh, uh, nothing, just...\" I paused for a moment, a feeling of nausea briefly taking effect on me. \"Is it getting hot in here?\" She chuckled.\n\n\"No, I think it's just you.\" She winked saying this. I chuckled, though not as relaxed as before, and replied, \"Yeah, but seriously, though, you don't feel that?\"\n\n\"Feel what?\"\n\n\"I don't know, it's burning up in here. Can you see the thermostat?\" She looked over to the far corner of the living room.\n\n\"It's only room temperature, hon,\" she said, her smile slowly giving way to a look of concern. \"Are you feeling okay?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" She put her the back of her had to my forehead. Almost immediately I winced, feeling like a scorching piece of metal had been pressed against it.\n\n\"Oh shit, Ricky, you *are* burning up.\"\n\n\"Look who's talking.\" I joked. Her face, however, told me she wasn't taking it that way. Her eyebrows raised.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You're even hotter than I am right now.\"\n\n\"Babe, I'm serious, I think you have a fever.\"\n\n\"I'm serious, too, your hand was just shy of singeing my hair just now.\" She got up and walked into the kitchen before returning with a glass of water and a couple of Tylenols. For just a moment, I swore I saw the water in the glass begin bubbling, the way it would if it were boiling. I didn't say anything, though.\n\n\"Here, take a couple of these. I'll make some food later, okay?\" I did as requested, despite knowing damn well I didn't have a fever. After that, she went to take a shower. I laid alone on the couch, alone once again. My mind was divided between thoughts of joining her in the shower and wonder at just what happened there.\n\nWhat was going on with Irene's skin just now, I wondered. I know she was directly under the sun and all, but it shouldn't have heated up like that, should it? I ended up electing the former option, to join her, and got up from the couch, undressing as I went toward the bathroom. I, almost skillfully in a way, managed to slip into the bathroom completely unnoticed; quieter than a mouse. Immediately upon entering, though, I noticed just how humid the air became. From the instant I walked in, it was like I'd walked into a steam room, moisture and steam from the air almost suffocating me. I actually had to turn around and walk right back out.\n\n*How the hell can SHE stand it in there?* I looked back into the bathroom. The water was still running, steam was still billowing out in clouds from the open doorway. Despite this, I could still hear Irene's soft, tender voice singing *\"May it be\",* not at all impeded by the heat. At one point, starting to put my clothes back on, I looked in the bathroom and my eyes widened when I saw a bright orange glow coming from. I was about to investigate further, but before I could reach the bathroom again, the glow disappeared and the water was turned off.\n\nNot knowing what the hell I was supposed to do -- if anything, really -- I went back to laying on the couch. Irene stepped out of the bathroom, towel drying her hair while the towel around her body slowly found itself falling away from her, \"accidentally\" revealing herself. Normally, I'd either get caught red-handed staring or I'd try to pretend not to notice; both of which elicited sly, playful giggles from her before one thing would lead to another and well...\n\nBut this time when she caught me staring, it was with a puzzled look on my face. \"What is it, hon?\" she asked.\n\n\"Um, nothing, just... I thought I saw something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I don't know, something glowing.\" She frowned.\n\n\"Glowing?\"\n\n\"Yeah, from the bathroom, while you were in the shower.\" She turned to look back at the bathroom before looking at me while pointing to it. I held up my dismissively. She did another double-take before shrugging the whole thing off and telling me that she was tired out after yoga and that she'd be going to lay down. She went into the bedroom while I remained on the couch; alone, confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI awoke, this time needing the restroom. It was night out, though everyone still appeared awake. Hundreds of blank eyes, dead faces, and hollow stares all focused forward. I'll admit, by this point, this was beginning to unnerve me. Why was everybody seemingly acting weird, all at the same time?\n\nRegardless, I slowly walked to the back of the cabin toward the restroom. At least, where I *thought* the restroom was. When I made it to the other end of the plane, though, as far as I could go, anyways, I couldn't find the restrooms anywhere. I looked and started back in the other direction. Along the way, I kept looking along the walls to see if maybe I missed the sign along the way. Needless to say, though, I hadn't.\n\nThen I started looking for an attendant or someone who might be able to help me. Through all of this, silence itself had a chokehold on the entire plane. I felt like I wasn't even *on* a plane, like I wasn't even *awake*! I made it to the front end of the plane and knocked in the door to the cockpit. I stood there for about a good 15 minutes with nothing at all happening. I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to knock again or just go back to my seat. In the end, the answer, to my surprise, would be neither as, shockingly, the door opened and out stepped a young, rail thin lady in an attendant's uniform.\n\n\"Excuse me, ma'am?\" I asked. She didn't respond, or move -- or even seem to breathe for that matter. \"Sorry to bother you, but I can't seem to find the restroom, you think you'd be able to help me out?\"\n\nShe continued staring at me with almost corpselike eyes; glazed looking and grayish white in color. Her mouth also seemed to hang sort of limply. Her face perfectly portrayed the emptiness of both her mind and her heart. In this sense, she didn't look dead -- she was *less than dead*. I waved my hand in front of her face, garnering no response from that, either.\n\n\"Ahem, may I speak to the captain, then?\" For the record, I knew that this wouldn't ever be allowed under normal circumstances, but A, these weren't exactly \"normal circumstances\", were they, and B, I was on the verge of slapping her just to get *some* kind of reaction or answer out of her, ad so I figured asking something a bit ludicrous wasn't altogether pointless.\n\nMore to my shock, it actually worked as she slowly spoke, saying in the most scratchy, monotone voice, devoid entirely of any recognizable emotion, save *maybe* depression (and even that's a bit of a stretch), \"Please return to your seat, sir. We will be reaching our final destination soon.\"\n\nThe way her mouth moved, coupled with the deadpanned tone in her voice, I almost swore it was some sort of puppet talking to me. \"Um... O-Okay, but I need the restroom, can you just tell me where--\"\n\n\"The time is almost here, sir. It will all be over soon.\" My eyes widened.\n\n\"E-Excuse me?\" I said, feeling my heart already starting to kick into overdrive.\n\n\"It will all be over soon, sir.\" she repeated, slowly turning back toward the door.\n\n\"B-But wait--\"\n\n\"Please return to your seat, sir.\" was the last thing I heard from her before she shut the door back in my face. For a moment, I stood, dumbfounded. *The hell was that? What was her problem?*\n\nI turned to look back at the other passengers. Each one of them stared unblinkingly toward me; not at me, but rather *through* me, the same way the attendant was just a second ago. *What the hell is going on?*\n\nI would've been a lot more inclined to press the attendant again for answers -- namely what the hell she meant by \"It will all be over soon\" -- but unfortunately, my need for the bathroom all but diminished any concentration I had with that. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and start hunting for the restroom myself again. I went through the cabin for about another 10 minutes, each one that passed making it harder and harder to hold it in, until I finally found what looked like a restroom about midway through. How I missed it, especially given that it was located just a few rows from where I was sitting, I didn't know, nor did I care.\n\nI rushed as quickly as I could to the door and swung it open before all but hurling myself head first inside. While I was in there, I started thinking again about what the flight attendant said. Now normally, I'd have chalked it up to just her having an off day or something. But then, why was *everybody* having an off day? Why was she the only one that'd speak at all?\n\n*\"We'll be reaching our final destination soon, sir.\"*\n\n*Why does that sound so familiar?* I thought then of her voice. Her face, how lifeless it looked, as well as the faces of the other passengers. All of it was familiar to me in a way that gave me an almost physically sickening feeling...\n\nBut why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"You okay, honey bunny?\" I asked her. She was on the couch, looking glumly out of the window. Her eyes broke from the window to look at me. The expression on her face was dead, careless, unfiltered, untouched with any sort of emotion. \"Irene, what's wrong?\"\n\nShe sighed, a sort of sigh that I almost couldn't hear. It was less like a sigh, actually, and more like she was just giving away her last breath. My heart melted right then and there, not even knowing what the hell was wrong. The sun shone, clear skies, and we were even off from work that day. I was even planning on surprising her with a trip to the movies -- her number one go-to when it came to ideas for date nights.\n\nI went over and reached out to put my hand on her shoulder when she retracted away from my hand. I froze, unsure of what I should or even *could* do. In all of that time, a little over two and a half years into our marriage, she'd never once gotten into moods like this. She always had the most beaming, vibrant, free-spirited personality I'd ever seen in a woman. She'd always been the sunshine to *my* cloudiest days, while I was always the one that kept her \"down to the Earth\" so to speak, keeping her feet on the ground, you know? But this...\n\n\"Irene, baby, talk to me, what happened?\" She looked at me; looking more *through* my eyes than at them. Her mouth slowly opened and she spoke in a voice I almost couldn't believe was coming from her. It sounded like I was hearing an answering machine talk to me -- with somehow even *less* inflection than one, if that was even possible.\n\n\"It's all going to end soon.\"\n\n\"Wh-What?\" I frowned. She kept staring, her face not wavering in the slightest. \"Baby, what're you talking about, *what's* ending?\"\n\nShe looked to the window again. I followed her gaze. Everything was normal outside. Vibrant. Alive. Cheerful.\n\n\"It's all ending, I can feel it.\" I slowly put my hand on her shoulder. I instantly jerked back when I felt that her skin was all of a sudden blistering hot again. It'd done this a few times before, and I could never understand why.\n\n\"Baby, you're burning up.\" I said to her. Her eyes didn't move from the window this time.\n\n\"It's coming to an end. Everything.\"\n\n\"I-I don't understand, what're you--\"\n\n\"Look at it all, Rick.\" I stopped, turning back toward the window. \"It's beautiful, isn't it?\"\n\nI stayed silent for a moment before answering, \"Y-Yeah it-it is.\" She let out another very faint sigh.\n\n\"Something's happening, Rick. To me. I-I...\" She trailed off for a moment before finishing with, \"I can feel it.\"\n\n\"What's coming?\" I asked.\n\n\"I... I don't know. I don't know what it is or why it's happening, but... I know it is, and it's happening soon.\" About ten to twenty minutes passed in silence after that. There was no real comeback for that, no optimistic or comforting thought I could give. Call me what you will; \"Terrible consolation\", \"Poor bedside manner\", or what have you, I didn't have any words of comfort to offer my wife in that moment. Like I said, she had never behaved or talked like this before, so I had absolutely no way to respond to this. And also like I mentioned, I was never the most uplifting type myself.\n\nDoing my best to at least *try* to comfort her, I spoke up in my cheeriest voice possible (though one that likely wouldn't have cheered up a crying child, let alone someone as depressed as she was), \"Hey, I think we should go to the movies today! We don't have work and I believe they're playing--\" I stopped when she turned to look at me, her face still dead as a doornail.\n\n\"Did you not hear a word I just said?\" She asked, her voice remaining in it's deadlocked monotone. I clammed up. \"I... I just can't, Rick. Not when I know it's all going to be over soon anyway.\" She took one last look at the window before getting up from the couch and walking into the bedroom.\n\n\"Wait, Irene, what're you--\" But she was shutting the door right as I was finishing. I stayed in the living room, sitting alone, speechless, with both my heart jackhammering in my chest as well as my head spinning all the way around like my it was a globe for a solid fifteen minutes. I couldn't decided whether I was supposed to go to her, to try again to comfort her, *somehow*, or if I should just stay there, sitting on my knees, staring at the hallway, jaw slacked, like an idiot.\n\nI wanted to hold her, don't get me wrong. I wanted to squeeze her the way you'd squeeze a plush toy when you were sad. I wanted to clutch her tightly to me like if I were to let go, I and the whole of reality would fall apart. But then, would that have made any difference?\n\nRegardless, a few moments later, I decided to get up from the floor and walked into the bedroom. On the bed laid my wife, laying straight and stiff on her right side, facing away from the doorway. I froze at the sight for two reasons. For starters, she never slept like this. She was always one to curl up into a ball, making it perfect to nuzzle against me, giving me that almost fatherly feeling like I was nestling a sleeping child next to me. But now this, as well the fact that her body was glowing.\n\nI rubbed my eyes to make sure I was seeing it correctly. Sure enough, amid the darkness, with the only *other* light perhaps coming from the window, bleeding past the curtains, there she was, a golden aura beaming around her. She was stiff, rigid, still, making me wonder if she was awake, asleep, or if she was dead. My foot raised to take a step, but I wasn't sure what to do. Of course, the logical answer would've been to go to her, maybe snuggle her close to me and say... well, that was just it, what the hell *was* I supposed to say?\n\nMy wife was glowing, and like the other times before, I could feel the heat blazing from her body. She was a sun in the middle of a dark abyss, a flame flickering in a dark hallway, one that appeared to be flickering out. The sight of this was killing me with every second I spent looking at it because of the fact that I knew she was in pain, but from what I couldn't begin to know. I finally took the step forward, then another, and another.\n\nMy feet more or less moved absently from my body. My mind and my body acted separate from each other; with every instinct telling me I needed to stay at the doorway and (albeit feebly) try figuring out what the hell's going on before I try going to her, while my body all but flipped its deuces at that and continued forward. I silently reached the bed, where I slowly climbed in behind her and went to put my arm around her when I froze, a stinging pain starting to shoot throughout my arm.\n\nMy arm hovered there for a moment before curling back to my body. And so, unable to touch her or say anything to her, I just laid there, staring at her stiffened back. The room was warm, quiet, the way you'd imagine a fireplace to sound, save the crackle of the flames. I don't know when or how long it'd been when I had the idea, but I suddenly found it in me to speak up. \"Hey, you wanna do something cool for our anniversary?\"\n\nShe made no movements, voicing no response. I continued anyway, \"You know, we never did get to make it to the top of the mountains like we'd always planned.\" She still didn't move, but I did see the glow around her starting to dim. Out of a sort of instinct, I reached out again to tough her back. It was still warm, but tolerable and becoming cooler and cooler by the second. I couldn't tell you why, other than a guess that whatever the hell it was that was going on with her, it was somehow liked to her emotions or something. In other words, my words were getting through to her in some way, comforting her.\n\nI started softly caressing her back along the length of her spine. Her skin continued to cool under my fingers. \"I can still see us,\" I started again, forming the image in my head of the two of us on the mountainside that day, three years ago, the day I first proposed to her. \"You remember, Baby?\"\n\n\"The clear, sunny sky, the big puffy clouds.\" I chuckled, \"You always call them \"Sky pillows\". Remember how we were laying down and looking at the sky pillows, trying to see who'd be the first to spot one that looked like a fish?\" Her body had all but stopped glowing by now an her body was just mildly lukewarm. Her skin felt soft and mellow again.\n\n\"I think you were the first one to actually find one. Said it looked like Nemo for some reason. I couldn't ever see it...\"\n\n\"Marlin.\" I heard her say faintly.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"It was Marlin, not Nemo.\" I chuckled.\n\n\"Right, Marlin, my bad.\"\n\n\"He was bigger than most of the other ones, but still only noticeable if you were looking, just like an actual fish in the ocean. Just like you.\" That's when I finally felt her body start to move beneath my fingers. She shifted around to face me. Her face was hard to see, with only half of it illuminated by the ever dimming rays from the window. That said, I could see that her haunting glare of sorrow, her empty stare, was gone, replaced with a more familiarly tender and loving face, the one a mother gives her child when they're what makes them smile that day.\n\n\"You always stood out to me; my lost little fish, alone in the sea, looking for something, but wasn't sure what.\" Her hand moved up to my chest, stroking it like how I stroked her back.\n\n\"You always had the better eyes of us both.\" I said. \"We stayed out there till the sun started going down.\"\n\n\"And all the little sky pillows went away...\" she finished, slipping a small, yet oh, so adorable little giggle.\n\nI snickered, \"Remember how we fell asleep, right there on the mountainside, and the ranger had to wake us up to run us out of there?\" I giggled, \"And you thought he was \"Smokey the bear.\" Her laugh was noticeable this time. \"You started freaking out and I had to hold onto you to keep from going apeshit on the guy.\" I took a deep breath then before asking her, \"You remember what I said to you?\"\n\nShe rolled over again, putting her face first on top of me, looking directly into my eyes, and she answered, \"Irene, baby doll, I will always love you, till the end of time\". You reached into your pocket and pulled out this ring, the most beautiful ring I'd ever seen.\" She held up her finger. \"And I grabbed you up and tried to snap you in half with a bear hug.\"\n\n\"Damn near did, too.\" I said, chuckling. She grinned a toothy grin, allowing the last rays of light from the window to accentuate each and every one of her beautiful, ivory teeth.",

        "text": "\n\n\r\nwhen i was a boy, i had no friends. not because i was fat or\r\nbecause i was a nerd, but because things happened to the people\r\naround me. bad things. this is the story of before i knew what\r\nwas happening in my life. so here is the terrifying story of my\r\nlife.\n\r\nthe bad things started out small, like some addictions start.\r\nit started with preschoolers falling and scraping their knees,\r\nnot bad enough for you yet well it grew to my friends breaking\r\nlimbs in freak accidents i unknowingly set up to happen. i only\r\nsaw the pattern when my last victim got killed. he was a little\r\nboy named freddy.\n\n we were having our first sleepover, playing a\r\nnew video game i got for my birthday just a week ago. i don‚Äôt\r\nknow why but i‚Äôve been bloodthirsty for killing games, i now\r\nknow that it‚Äôs because of the demon that latched onto me when i\r\nwas just born. so he said he would go get a soda. so as he was\r\ncoming back i was just in a fight with a minigun as a weapon\r\nwhich i was using to mow down wave upon wave of aliens.\n\n he slipped behind me with the glass of mountain dew in hand and he\r\nfell on the glass. which pierced his eye leaving in it pieces of\r\nshattered glass. i just sat there thinking that his scream was\r\npart of the game. but my mom got worried and came to check on\r\nus. she saw my friend lying in the blood and let out a\r\nbloodcurdling scream that made me turn around. i was about to\r\nask what it was but i saw it before i could ask. my friend had\r\nalready bled out.\r\nthat was a year ago. i remember the police saying it was like\r\nhe tripped on air. but let's go back to a little after the thing.\r\nshall we.\r\nmy mom moved me to a room next to hers for the time being.\r\nand i was looking through some old photos of me and dad before\r\nhe died. but something disturbed me. in one of the photos i saw\r\nsomething in the background. i was in the picture and across the\r\nstreet from where the picture was taken i saw a shadowy figure.\r\nit was disturbing to look at.\n\n i had a crazy idea. i was look at the\r\nmore photos of me and in each of them the figure kept getting\r\ncloser until it was close enough that i could see its eyes. the\r\neyes of the figure were blood red and full of loathing. it gave me\r\ngoosebumps to think of them they made me tired i almost fell\r\nasleep.\n\n but as i saw him more in the photos i grew more and more\r\nsure that this figure was the cause of my troubles. when i was\r\nsure that the figure was the cause i heard a scraping in the hall.\r\ni slowly looked up frightened almost to death. i saw the figure\r\nmore clear than i have ever saw him. it was as if he was feedingon my fear, sucking it out of me. he let out a chuckle when he\r\nsaw the pee drip down my leg. he lunged with amazing speed and\r\nagility. his claws run down my chest, leaving a searing white hot\r\npain in its wake.\r\nthen, i wake up from my life wrenching nightmare. i find\r\nmyself drenched in sweat and pee. i look up and i see a figure\r\nlaunching itself from above me through the door. along the\r\nwalls of my room i see what looks like blood scrawled in one\r\nword ‚ÄúNOLA‚Äù. \n\nmy chest still feels like it was ripped open so i pull\r\nup my t-shirt and along my chest are four scars that look like a\r\nbear mauled me. they ran across my chest just like they did in my\r\ndream. i get out my laptop and search the word along my wall. it\r\npopped up on google as the demon in the exorcism of emily rose.\r\nit is the sixth demon of hell. i feel hot breath on my neck and\r\neven though it's hot breath it sends a cold shiver down my spine.\r\ni turn and my mom is staring at the screen. she wants to know\r\nwhy i'm looking at stuff like that. i wonder why she didn‚Äôt scream\r\nabout the walls. but when i look back i see the walls are\r\nunblemished.\n\n i pull up my shirt and my mom yelps. she sees the\r\nscars for some reason. she takes me to the hospital. but they say\r\nthat those must have been there for a while. but i know\r\ndifferent, i say they weren‚Äôt there the night before. and they say\r\nthat we were just freaking out.\r\nthe next day i was making a sandwich, and while i was i saw\r\nthe figure as i was slicing the tomatoes. i yelp as the blade slices\r\nthrough my right thumb going down the length of my thumb.\n\n but as i watch i see the wound seal itself until there is nothing but\r\na jagged scar. i am mesmerized as i replay the flesh sealing itself\r\nin my mind. then i see the figure standing there with a wicked\r\ngrin. he says in the creepiest voice i‚Äôve heard in my life. it was a\r\nvoice mixed with all of my loved ones voices in it. he says in his\r\nvoice that he wouldn‚Äôt want me to get hurt before the ritual. i\r\nalmost pass out i ask what ritual. he waits a moment as if\r\ndeciding whether to tell me or not. he finally decides to tell me\r\nafter what seemed like hours. \n\nhe says that he will take over my\r\nbody in the next full moon and that there is no stopping him. i\r\nfaint i see mom standing over me sad looking as if someone died.\r\nshe acts like a broken record, saying the same thing over and\r\nover again. i ask her what is wrong and she says in a demonic\r\nvoice, it‚Äôs too late i have taken over you. and everything morphed\r\ninto an evil, demonic version of my house. there i have been ever\r\nsince the incident. \n\nhe sent me to the version of my world that\r\nmade sense, where there were no lies. everything was as it is\r\nsupposed to be. and i have embraced it. i say with a demonic grin.",

        "text": " \n\nMy son wanted to go to Chuck E. Cheese‚Äôs for his 8th birthday. He hyped it up for weeks, begging us every chance he got.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a party, I just want to go to Chuck E. Cheese together.‚Äù \n\nWe dismissed it at first, thinking he would soon substitute the craze with Minecraft and forget about it, but he was adamant about going. We figured this was following the obsession with animatronics and the like on YouTube, one of the things he would watch during his allotted screen time. \n\nWe were also worried about disappointing him. Truth be told, we weren‚Äôt *actually sure* if there was even a Chuck E. Cheese‚Äôs still open; the days of birthday pizza parties were long gone for me and my wife. When you‚Äôre an adult you don‚Äôt keep track of that sort of thing, you just get a little sad when you hear about the chains being shut down in passing. Like *Hollywood Connections,* or *Celebration Station.*\n\nWhen it appeared he wasn‚Äôt letting go of the idea, we decided we‚Äôd look into it. A quick google search assured us that even though many of the restaurants had indeed closed their doors, there were a few stragglers hanging on. One of which happened to be an hour away.\n\nWe caved and cemented the plans, soaking in the ecstatic radiance when we assured him: *Yes, we are going to Chuck E. Cheese‚Äôs.*\n\nAnd go there we did. We loaded into the car on the morning of his birthday, listening to cheers of excitement as we set the gps and pulled out of the driveway. The drive wasn‚Äôt too bad, as it was only a couple of towns over, and our son slept through most of the ride. On the way there we couldn‚Äôt help but feel a little excited ourselves; through the slog of work and stress you tend to forget about such innocent joys, and it brought back some of that old youthful magic. We were even excited to see the mechanical rat.\n\nWhen we pulled up it was different than we expected. Chuck E Cheese looked‚Ä¶ different. It appeared during our time not going to the restaurant or keeping up on commercials, the restaurant had rebranded. The mascot looked different, the building looked different, everything *felt* different.\n\nLuckily, our son was still as excited as ever. Even though we were bummed out, we didn‚Äôt want to sour the mood for him. Since he was all smiles, we tried to be all smiles. We opened the front door, ready for pizza and games and a playplace.\n\nWhat we got was a madhouse.\n\nThe restaurant was packed to the brim. Sugar-fueled kids running around like crazy, while tired and impatient parents attempted to corral them. People bumping into each other so they didn‚Äôt get separated, each wincing against the noise. \n\nIt was loud. No animatronics, no ball pit, no play place. Cartoon fun and pizza signs replaced with pristine walls and quotes assured fresh dough and toppings. Classic mascots that used to move and sing were replaced by decorations of the replacements on the walls, the jungle-gyms and stage replaced by sardine-packed arcade games. Nobody walked around in a suit to greet you, you were just filed into the counter where you decided how much you were going to spend on gaming bracelets and food. It appeared the magic we remembered as kids had been gone for a long, long time. My wife and I exchanged looks, the let down mutual between us.\n\nOur son didn‚Äôt seem to mind, so we didn‚Äôt make a big deal about it. He was a little disappointed that there weren‚Äôt any animatronics, but he seemed to get over it after seeing the kids have fun playing games. Plus there were unlimited refills on pop, so that was a plus. We got him hooked up with a gaming bracelet and placed an order for pizza, one that gave you one of those vibrating coasters that would alert when the food was ready. Then we proceeded to follow him around to each arcade booth. Whack-a-mole and skee-ball, along with new digital games we had never heard of. Kids yelled and screamed as we went from one station to the next, and I could feel our slow descent of fatigue, just like the exhausted parents we saw when we got in.\n\nAfter playing games for a while, I got the alert that the pizza was ready. We pulled away from the games and picked out a table (which wasn‚Äôt as extravagant and exciting as it used to be) and I went to go get the pizza while they held our spot. \n\nI weaved through the crowd and headed for the bathroom, deciding I was going to take a leak before grabbing the food. I had been getting my money‚Äôs worth from the unlimited fountain, and the many vanilla Coke‚Äôs were making a comeback.\n\nThe bathroom was sticky, and eerily empty. I went to a urinal quickly and went about my business, trying to hurry so there were no issues with the pizza. Once I was finished and washing my hands, I heard something strange over the cringey Kidz Bop playing over the intercom. Through the wall I could hear a commotion, like some kind of argument. I tried to make out what they were saying but it was too muffled, but it seemed pretty heated. It even sounded like someone was throwing stuff around. \n\nI chalked it up to trouble in the kitchen. Maybe there were too many orders. Maybe they were short-staffed.\n\nI made my way to the food counter and found the pizzas waiting for me. There wasn‚Äôt anyone there to hand them off, but the order matched so I took them. I weaved back through the crowd and rejoined my wife and son, where we started to eat.\n\nAside from the noise, it was nice to sit and relax. Overall the birthday getaway seemed like a success, and he still had a little bit of time on the wristband to play once he was done eating, so he was happy. Looking around you could still feel some of the cheer that you could get in the old days, like it was hiding underneath the makeover. If you overlooked the modernization, it didn‚Äôt seem so bad after all.\n\nThat joy ended abruptly, when I saw him.\n\nI was helping myself to another slice of pizza when I noticed him across the room, like he was staring at me. Big cartoon eyes, unmistakable rodent mouth. He was watching me from the back of the room, through the crack of the doors that read ‚ÄúEmployees Only‚Äù. At first I thought it was a gimmick and he was coming out for someone‚Äôs party. But there was something that rubbed me wrong from the start.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt the new, happy-go-lucky mascot they had plastered on the walls and windows. This was a dingy, dirty costume of the mascot from the 90‚Äôs. Even from afar the suit looked dirty and neglected, and the way he stood there watching us, it was like he was *stalking.*\n\nIt was Charles Entertainment Cheese.\n\nHe pushed through the doors slowly, waddling with each step like he was trying not to tip over. His big cartoon head panned from side to side, taking in the room before settling back on us. His eyes fluttered lazily and he headed over, bumping into people as he made his way through the crowd. Some kids cheered and tried to hug him, but their parents pulled them away. The suit looked slimy, like it had been dug out of the garbage.\n\nI nudged my wife, who followed my gaze before gasping. She looked at me cautiously, like I had set it up. I shook my head and shrugged. We started to pack up to make an exit, but we didn‚Äôt get enough time.\n\nChuck E. Cheese shambled over to us quickly, blocking us in the booth. He was taller up close, his lazy eyes taking their time looking at me and my wife. He gave off the stench of old garbage, and he would twitch every so often, like something was wrong underneath. Like an animatronic that was shorting out. Our son started to cheer, and we inched closer to protect him.\n\nWithout a word, Chuck E Cheese held out a closed hand in offering. In the back of my mind I wondered if it was some last ditch effort for birthday parties, and they had dug the thing out of storage to restore some of the old magic. I thought this would terrify my son, but looking face to face with Charles was like seeing a YouTube thumbnail in real life. Before we could stop him, he held out his hand under his.\n\nChuck E. silently opened his hand, and a wet object felt from his matted fur. We looked at it in disbelief as our son held it up to inspect it.\n\nIt was a human tongue.\n\nBehind us people started to scream, not at Chuck E., but at something else. People were shambling out from the back of the restaurant, people dressed in aprons and visors, each torn and covered in blood. One nursed a broken arm, another‚Äôs face horribly beaten. The last screamed silently through the gush of blood out of their mouth.\n\nI looked back at Chuck E., who returned a sinister stare. My son dropped the tongue on the floor and started to cry, something that made his big body twitch. In his gaping mouth I could see the screen, where the wearer would be able to breath and see. Inside I saw movement. Lots of it.\n\nWithout warning his mouth exploded, four human arms spilling out with grasping hands. A tortured groan bellowed from his flailing maw as he reached for our son. I kicked him away and shouted for my family to run, holding him off as they climbed over the booth to escape. Kids and parents alike screamed, and the arcade crowd scattered like delirious human roaches.\n\nI tried to hold him off but he tossed me aside effortlessly, hefting me over his head and sending me crashing into the whack-a-mole table. I saw stars for a moment, trying to get back up while repeatedly shoved by panicked patrons. Eventually someone helped me up, and through the fog I saw it was my wife helping me up. She got me to my feet and we made our way for the exit through the chaos. I stole a look at Chuck E., who was quickly becoming a monstrosity. Additional arms had burst from his eye sockets, and human legs had sprouted from the sides of his stubby legs. He was hoisting another man into the air, some of the hands forcing their way down his throat while the rest worked at manually disemboweling. We covered our son's eyes so he couldn‚Äôt see, but a part of me knows he did. Some birthday this turned out to be.\n\nWhen we reached the exit, we were shocked to see people were moving *away* from it. Or rather, being pushed back in. Police were shoving past, some shouting orders, others panning the room with weapons. Everyone had their guns drawn.\n\nOutside we could hear sirens, and the shouts of people trying to order the chaos. With Chuck E. bellowing behind us, the officers stepped in and formed a line against him, racking shotguns and raising pistols to form a firing squad. As we headed into the funnel of bodies, I took one last look at Charles, who was ignoring every demand to stand down. The multiple arms were holding a dead body against a skee-ball machine, repeatedly breaking it at different angles in an attempt to remove it. It‚Äôs a horrible sight I‚Äôll never forget.\n\nWe burst into the light just as they opened fire, and we looked harrowingly back at the building as we heard round after round fire off. We could hear the groaning continue for a moment, but after enough gunshots, it ceased to be.\n\nWe never really found out what happened that day. The news glazed over the actual details, only stating there were four casualties in an unprecedented attack. It was the undoing of that particular building, another set of doors to close in the shadow of a once legendary birthday experience. We didn‚Äôt talk much about the incident at home‚Ä¶ mostly because we didn‚Äôt know what to say. Our son has since stopped watching any animatronic videos, and everything related to it. He doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it, but he‚Äôs still having nightmares over it. I imagine he will for the rest of his life.\n\nRumors spread like fire online, and people posted their theories on the *true* cause behind the madness that day. Some say a bunch of mental patients broke out and attacked the staff before collectively climbing into the old suit. Others say it was an old abomination from the 90‚Äôs locked up in the restaurant basement, where they fed it in exchange for financial success. There was even a rumor it was the original owner reincarnated, and dozens more even crazier than that. \n\nThe only thing I know for sure, is I‚Äôm never going to Chuck E. Cheese again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[‚ÄîAHS](https://www.reddit.com/r/HawaiianShirtFiction/comments/s1rwfv/online_story_archive/)",

        "text": "  \n\nI had one more delivery. It was late in the afternoon, and I had made enough money for the day to call it quits. It was a grocery order out in the boonies. I don‚Äôt know why I took it. It was a small order- a pack of bacon and a box of condoms. I felt like I should pitch in a case of beer to complete the order-on me of course. The house was off the main road tucked away in some wooded hills. The dirt road driveway meandered up and down and around several curves, until it opened up onto the main property at the bottom of a hill. There was a rustic country house with a two-door garage. There were a number of animals on the property, especially a large number of chickens. \n\nI parked my truck and went up to the front door. I left the bag on the front porch and took a picture of it with my phone. I punched in the order as complete, rang the doorbell and went to my car.  I sat there for a minute. I don‚Äôt know why but I was curious to see who would order bacon and condoms. Not really that odd, but not something I deliver every day either. I try to imagine the personality of the people I deliver to by the groceries they order. I guess the only thing I could gleam from this order was that this guy was a carnivorous stud, running out of condoms quite frequently. Something I couldn‚Äôt say about myself.  \n\nNo one came to the door. Must‚Äôve been busy. I started to back out of the driveway. I turned to look behind me as I went into reverse. There in the sky was a bright hovering red light. It pulsated and a thick nauseous mist disseminated out from underneath the light. I felt sick to my stomach. I looked back toward the house. Some of the chickens were dead, others were walking erratically. The front door of the house opened but no one came out.  \n\nI woke up the next morning, or at least I thought it was the next morning. When I looked at my phone, it was two days later. Maybe I was dreaming. I was disoriented, trying to understand what had happened or if it had even happened at all. I looked at my past orders and sure enough there it was. The home address with an order of bacon and condoms. I tried my best to remember the rest of the night or more importantly, how did I get home. I thought that maybe I should drive back to that address and see what was there. \n\nI was waffling on my decision to go back or not. It's one thing to deliver an order but quite another to trespass and it‚Äôs not like I could say I was turning around. Once you get to the house it's pretty obvious you committed to going the distance. Eventually I convinced myself to do it, but I had a story to fall back on. I was going to say that I thought I left something out of the order and wanted to know if he had everything he needed. \n\nI got to the house and noticed that the front door was still opened. Now, every chicken in the yard was dead, carcasses lying everywhere. I put the truck in park but left it running with the door propped open in case I needed to make a quick escape.  I walked up the front porch stairs and looked inside. The house was empty. There was no furniture. The floors and walls were nice and clean. There was nothing cozy about this place. It was too sanitized. Wiped clean of all color, all white. It was nothing you‚Äôd expect of a house in the hills. The exterior was country cottage, but the interior was a hospital. \n\n‚ÄúHello. Anyone home. I was just checking on your grocery order.‚Äù\n\nNothing. I ventured inside and made my way through each room on the lower level. The kitchen, living room, bathroom, and dining room all the same, nothing but white walls and floors. I was obsessing about the brightness of it all. It didn‚Äôt look real. I walked over to one of the dining room walls, reached out to touch it but my hand went right through it. I jerked back my hand and went to another wall to do the same. This time it was solid. I wandered at that point if I should just run. This was too much, but I was curious about upstairs. I was both frightened and intrigued. \n\nI started to climb the stairs, half expecting my feet to go right through the illusion and fall flat on my ass, but it was solid, and I quickly made my way upstairs. I would take a quick look and get out of there. There were no rooms, but one large open area, with a vaulted ceiling. Up against the far corner was a pod. It looked like a silver coffin with a tiny window, entwined with cables and wires. I walked up to the pod and inside I saw me, except that in certain parts of my face there were dark reddish spots and exposed veins. Whatever was happening it seemed the process was not quite finished. The body inside the pod opened its eyes. I was startled. I ran out of there and got to my truck, backed out and headed up the driveway but I don‚Äôt remember ever getting out of the property and onto the road. \n\nThe next morning, I woke up. I grabbed my phone and looked at the date. Two more days gone. How could I sleep two whole days? It was impossible. I had to be losing my mind. There was a knock on my apartment door. I answered it. It was my neighbor, a big burly guy with a long red beard. \n\n‚ÄúYou got a problem son,‚Äù he said as he started to act is if he was about to commence beating me into oblivion. \n\n‚ÄúWhoa man, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou ever talk to my wife like that again and I‚Äôll kill you!‚Äù He stormed off but looked back over his shoulder to give me one last threatening stare. \n\nI didn‚Äôt have time for this. I had to go do some orders, make some money. Time was getting away from me and rent was due. I took a shower, put on my clothes, and went out to the truck. The first order on my phone was that address with an order for bacon and condoms. No thank you. Hit cancel. I accepted another order, a bigger order close by that would make more money.  \n\nI didn‚Äôt get a chance to complete the order. I don‚Äôt know what happened. I woke up from a deep sleep, but I wasn‚Äôt in my apartment. I was in my truck parked in front of that house. The front door was wide open. I reached for the ignition, but the keys were gone. I looked back towards the house and out walked my doppelganger. I was stunned and unable to make myself move. It was weird to see myself walking towards myself. As he got closer, I could see that we weren‚Äôt a perfect match. He had a large vein protruding from his forehead. I started to get out of the truck and run but he pushed me to the ground, rolled me over, and sat on top of me. He was unusually strong. He put his hands around my throat and started to choke the life out of me. \n\nI woke up in my bed. It was night and now I was confused about everything. I didn‚Äôt know the date, the time, or even who I was. I walked to the living room and there sitting on my couch was my big burley neighbor. He turned toward me but this time he wasn‚Äôt agitated but frightened. \n\n‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt hurt me. Man, that was a month ago. I‚Äôm sorry, but you know I got to protect my family. You would do the same. ‚Äú\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you talking about and what are you doing in my apartment?‚Äù I started to walk towards him and noticed that his hands and feet were bound by rope. The front door opened, and my doppelganger walked in with a large butcher knife in his hand. Now my neighbor was both confused and frightened. The doppelganger didn‚Äôt hesitate. He walked over to my neighbor and shoved the butcher knife into his throat. He slowly pulled it out and then shoved it right back in. He seemed fascinated by the process. He did it several more times. The doppelganger was blocking the front door, so I had to run to my bedroom and jump out the window. As I got out the window, I looked back, but I didn‚Äôt see him following me. He wasn‚Äôt pursuing me at all. \n\nWhere was I going to go. There was a dead guy in my apartment and no doubt people had seen me talking to him. I had no family here in Georgia. I had moved from California. I thought maybe I should just go back home, but that would be the obvious thing to do. The police would expect that. I needed to just randomly pick a place on the map and start all over. I decided to pick a place that I would enjoy, reasoning that I would probably spend the rest of my life in jail anyway, might as well have a good time until I got caught. I would drive down to Florida and visit the beach. I walked around to the side of the apartment building and peered around to see if he was at my truck. I didn‚Äôt see anyone there. I ran to the truck, hopped in, and got out of there. I drove to the interstate and headed south. Maybe I‚Äôll get one last look at the ocean before I‚Äôm locked up in a cell. \n\nI drove for three hours. I was getting extremely tired. I pulled over to a rest stop and took a nap. I woke up parked right back at that damn house. I looked at my phone, and yet again, two more days had passed. I was done. There was no escaping. I had to go and confront this thing and just either kill it or be killed. I walked through the open door and went upstairs. There on the floor was my neighbor with his head barely attached. I walked over to the pod. There was my doppelganger, but he looked completed. There was no ridiculously large vein. It was finished. I needed to get in that pod and kill that damn thing. There can only be one of me. I looked for hinges or a handle, anything that I could pry open. There was nothing but I did see a seam. I hadn‚Äôt noticed until now, but I had been holding the butcher knife all this time. Did I grab it as I came into the house? I saw my neighbor‚Äôs blood, not fresh, but dried and peeling. I drove the knife into the seam and used it like a lever. The top panel gave a little and I slid my hands in between and begin to pull. I was looking down and yanking on the panel when finally, it opened. I stood erect and looked to see that the pod was empty. I dropped the knife. I felt as if I was going to faint. \n\nI went downstairs to the bathroom, turned on the faucet, and splashed some water in my face. I looked up at the mirror. On the side of my forehead was a ridiculously large vein, protruding and pulsating, thumping hard, and giving me an excruciating headache. I fell to the floor, my vision blurry, and before I passed out, I heard a chicken in the yard. \n\nI woke up in my truck at a rest stop surrounded by police, blue lights flashing, a dozen or so cars. I could hear them commanding me to slowly get out of the truck with my hands in the air. I complied of course, what else could I do? I got down on my knees and then laid on my stomach. They rushed over and handcuffed me. They put me in the back of a squad car. As we drove off, I saw a large red light in the sky. I prayed that the next time I woke up it would be on the beach with the wind in my face, and the sound of the waves in my ears.",

        "text": "One day, I'm laying on my bed and I go on my phone. I go to pictures and I decide to scroll all the way down. To see my pictures from awhile ago. \n\nI'm feeling nostalgic and I'm wondering how different my life was and how much I've changed. While looking through the photo's that I took. I see a strange man in the background.\n\nHe looks out of place, creepy, kinda grey, black hair and a brown hoodie. As I scroll to more of my pictures, I see him again and again and agian. \n\nI check the easiest photo's I have on my phone from 7 years ago, and he's there too. In the background. I check the photo's I took yesterday and he's their took. In the background. \n\nI stand up, a little frightened and confused. I don't know what to think about this. So I take a picture of my window. Then I see the photo on my phone and he's their too. Standing in the street. I look at my window and he's not there.\n\nI look at the photo, he's their, I look at my window and he's not there. \n\nMabye it's just a bug, with my phone. I shouldn't be worried. It's just a bug. A small problem. I shouldn't be worried so I ignore it. \n\nI go through my day, eating, watching, going on YouTube but I can't get the imagine of the grey man out of my head. \n\nThe more I think of him, the more scared I get. I try to distract myself, playing video games and I eventually forget. \n\nLater at night, I'm laying in bed and the lights are off. Suddenly I hear a noise, and creepy noise of someone coming up the stairs. \n\nI lay in bed in terror. I hide under the covers pretending I'm asleep. The noise gets closer and closer. I'm panicking under my pillow. Hoping it'll go away. \n\n\nI hear it come in my room, closer to my bed. I'm also in tears, I don't know what to do. I feel it standing above me. \n\nI decide that, I shouldn't be scared, this is my home. I can't just let this thing attack me. \n\nSo I jump up and grab onto it. It's the grey man from the photo's. I start to strangle it with all my strength.\n\n\nWith all my range, I hold tight onto its throat, Suddenly it grabs my waist and picks me up, and runs towards the window. \n\nYet we don't crash, we phase through it. We come the other side and it's my room. \n\nOnly its not night, its morning. I fall to the ground in confusion. I just teleported through a window. \n\nThe grey man is standing above me, and just phases away. He disappears. \n\nI stand up and look around, I touch the window to see if I can phase through it, but it's just a window. \n\nThen I look through it and see that everything is off. It looks older. \n\nI look around my room and realize, it's different too. I look on the papers I have on my desk and realize, I'm in a completely different year, it's 2014. \n\nI traveled back in time somehow, I'm excited, then I realized there's no sound. \n\nEnd of part 1",

        "text": "I've never been the type of person that enjoys spending the night at a friends house. Im fine with sleeping over at a relatives, but sleeping with a friend has always been a bit foreign to me. This might come as a surprise, considering I'm currently 16 years old. But that does make some sense sense I don't really have many friends anyways. In fact, I truthfully only have one person who I call my friend. Her name is Elia. She's like a sister to me, she understands me very well and is super fun to hang out with. She has long straight brown hair and blue eyes. She kinda looks like my mom who passed a way a few years ago. However, that isn't important.\n\nElia once asked If I wanted to come spend the night the upcoming weekend. I was a bit surprised as she had never asked this in the past. I was also very nervous. I didn't want to say yes because I was afraid it would go horribly wrong or something. I thought I'd end up ruining it or making a bad impression in front of her parents. She was my best friend though so I reluctantly agreed. \n\nOur car pulled up into there driveway, Elia was waiting for me smiling in front of her house. Her house was pretty nice. It was two stories high and much bigger than mine. I walked up to Elia who looked very exited to see me. Her parents were standing behind her with very inviting smiles. After greeting me they went to introduce themself's to my parents. In the meantime me and Elia walked inside. She gave me a brief tour of her house before we made it to her room. So far, everything was going fine. \n\nMe and Elia played on her play station for a while, we were getting really competitive in game. thats when I turned and notice a bunch of intense scratches all over her door. They looked fairly new and If Im being honest it kind of worried me. But I decided I was probably over thinking it which is something I do a lot.\n\nAfter a while Elias mom came in. \n\n\"Its getting late, you guys need to get in bed now.\"\n\nElia has two twin beds in her room, both next to each other just a little bit apart from one another. We each got in bed and turned off the lights.\n\n\"Good night, Sara. Sleep well.\" she said tiredly.\n\n\"Good night.\" I replied slowly drifting off. \n\nI quickly fell asleep to what I'd hope would be sweet dreams. I slept more deeply than usual, and my dreams weren't filled with fear and worry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"My favorite hobby is writing.\"\n\nMy eyes opened and my body instantly became cold. I jerked my head of my pillow and screamed at the horrific sight. Elia was standing up watching me in bed. her face was extremely pale, as if she had a fever. Her brown hair hung down on the sides of her head and she had absolutely no expression. she was just looking down at me with this pale, pale eyes.\n\n\"I really like foxes. My favorite hobby is writing.\" She said\n\nI was so frozen with fear that I couldn't even come up with a response. What was she even talking about? I instantly got out of bed and ran out of the room. That might sounds like a stupid thing to do but Im a very fearful person and when you're so scared you cant think straight. Once I exited the room I could hear Elia yelling after me. Her calls sounded like crying and yells at the same time.\n\nI began to run down the hall trying to ignore the horrible yells. Eventually I made it to Elias parents room to tell them about the situation. I quickly opened the door and the sight I saw made my heart skip a beat. Both Elias parents were standing next to each other with their faces looking at me. It was as if they were waiting for me to open the door. My mouth opened but I couldn't make out any words. They were both just standing there watching me. \n\nFinally I came to my senses and moved from the scene. The moment that I left from their view they began to yell. The same terrifying yell Elia let out. I eventually found their bathroom and locked myself in. I checked the clock, It was 3:14 AM. I hoped they wouldn't find me. but they did. I nearly jumped as the three of them began banging on the bathroom door, pleading me to open the door. However, as time went on their pleads began to turn into angry demands. I couldn't help but sit there crying with my hands over my eyes. I had no Idea what was going on.\n\nEventually their cries died off. But I didn't open the door, I waited for the sun to come out. Once It did I opened the bathroom door and left. I made my way past all of the bedrooms and out of the house. I didn't want to see any of their faces again. I ended up cutting all connection with them as the entire scenario was very traumatizing for me. Once again, I am a very fearful person. \n\nThat was four years ago and I haven't heard from them sense. However, I did recently get a text from an anonymous number saying \"I really like foxes. My favorite hobby is writing.\" I just hope it's not what I think it is.",

        "text": "I live in a rural logging community. I was born here and Heaven willing, I‚Äôll die here one day. Hopefully, not too soon. Every town or community has its industry. Ours is lumber and paper products. With a renewable resource management program, the replanted trees and forest comes back again and again. The town founders employ a sustainable business model which is both ecologically sound, and beneficial for the environment. \n\nI explain all this historical information because it‚Äôs pertinent to the cautionary tale I‚Äôm about to reveal. There are logging trails all over the county and through the woods. Many go back to the era of horse-drawn carriages. Because the same sections of the mountains are harvested each new cycle, those same rugged paths are reused unto perpetuity. Of course the town has modern highway systems with paved roads and an interstate nearby, but those logging trails connect one side of the mountain to the other. Most people simply drive around the forest on the main highway, but occasionally it‚Äôs tempting to use a shortcut to save time. That is, if you have a 4WD which can handle it. \n\nAs a teenager, I made that journey with friends through the woods several times. Other than getting stuck in the deep ruts the timber trucks made, the isolation and ‚Äòdanger‚Äô was fun. It was an adventure a number of kids experienced, back in the day. The trip over the mountain takes at least an hour, and if your vehicle broke down or got stuck, you were just screwed. Cell phones didn‚Äôt exist back then so you had to choose a direction and walk until you reached a phone. It would‚Äôve been even worse if you were mid-way across. Luckily, that never happened to me.\n\nOne of the peculiar things about the logging road was a rustic building erected near the summit. There was no electricity, nor any reason anyone could think for why it would be built in such a desolate place. Legends swirled around the old, abandoned dwelling, but kids being kids, most of their creative theories were madeup nonsense offered to scare people. It was fun to invent creepy reasons for its existence and who might‚Äôve lived in it, but no one seemed to have any concrete answers. \n\nThe half dozen times I drove past the spooky wooden shack as a teenage hellion, it appeared to be unused and empty. Frankly, it‚Äôs amazing none of us ever stopped to check it out. We always talked about doing that but never did. Usually we‚Äôd make plans to explore it on our return trip, and then decided to drive around the mountain instead, to get back home. Once was enough traversing over the rough, impassable terrain and frankly, none of us wanted to be stranded on top of the mountain. Certainly not after dark with that creepy wooden structure along the way. \n\nYears later I‚Äôd grown up, started a family, and had mostly forgotten about the old lodge on the mountain. My kids longed for adventure on the weekends but I wasn‚Äôt about to traipse through the wilderness in the family SUV. All that went right out the window after I sweet-talked my wife into allowing me to buy a lifted pickup truck. It was clearly an overindulgent, midlife crisis, but she was relieved it wasn‚Äôt worse. I could‚Äôve lobbied for a red Italian sports car instead. The ‚Äòbig rig‚Äô was cheaper on insurance. \n\nOne gloomy Sunday afternoon I gathered the whole family and we drove toward the entrance of the old logging road. The kids were excited and almost bounced in the back seat. My wife rolled her eyes in bemused annoyance. She already regretted green-lighting the behemoth in which we rode. A bumpy journey across a rutty mountain trail, hewn by logging trucks wasn‚Äôt even on her imaginary radar. She would‚Äôve driven around the forest a thousand times before even considering going over it, but here we were. As an individual, it was a total waste of time to her, but I think she saw it as a beneficial family excursion which held merit for that reason. The sum was greater than the individual parts.\n\nEarly on, I was surprised to see how many things hadn‚Äôt changed in the past twenty years. In some cases, sections of the logging trail were in better shape than in my youth. The kids seemed disappointed we weren‚Äôt bounding over creek beds and deep ravines. I myself was secretly relieved. Even though the new truck had all the mountaineering bells and whistles, it was still limited by the relative inexperience of the off-roading rookie behind the wheel. I didn‚Äôt want to strand my family up there in the dark. I‚Äôd never hear the end of it by ‚Äòyou know who‚Äô. \n\nEven though it was mid-afternoon, the gloom and heavy cloud cover made it appear much later in the evening. When we did encounter rough areas, the kids actually cheered. It was like a roller coaster ride for them. My wife looked at me nervously as the truck jostled back and forth violently. Luckily we made it over each hurdle and logging rut with varying levels of success. \n\nIt was about this point when the lost memories of the old wooden dwelling came flooding back. I wondered if it still stood there in the forest. An old timer had once told me it was ‚Äòsome old church‚Äô, or unknown ‚Äòhouse of worship‚Äô; but the very idea was preposterous. No one lived there, nor would anyone make the difficult trek to meet others on a weekly basis. It did look like an abandoned temple or lodge, but no religious iconography or signage was present. Apparently, if you knew what it was there for, you didn‚Äôt need to advertise or explain to others. \n\nAs we rounded the next corner, I saw the familiar form of the mysterious ‚Äòchurch‚Äô come into view. To my utter shock, the distinctive glow of candles shown through multiple unshuttered window openings! My mouth flopped open. My wife and kids were equally perplexed, but in their case it was because of the random placement of this unknown shack. They didn‚Äôt have the benefit of knowing I‚Äôd seen it a dozen times and never witnessed it occupied by anything but darkness. They were focused on the bizarreness of its forest isolation. I was disturbed it wasn‚Äôt empty.\n\nDozens of hooded souls sat facing what I could only assume, was an occult altar of some kind. Their dark robes completely hid their identities from our vantage point while we sped past it. From their secluded location, the partitioners of this hidden congregation were just as startled by our presence as we were of them. Several heads turned our direction at the distinctive sound of a revving 4WD blowing by. I floored the gas to put distance between us, but that just raised more concern and questions. \n\nMy wife picked up on my growing alarm and it permeated her whole demeanor. Even our kids noticed my erratic behavior but I was too busy trying to navigate the perilous ruts, too reassure them. We hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. The mountain road was a public thoroughfare and we weren‚Äôt trespassing; but that hardly mattered if we broke down twenty miles from nowhere. There was no cell service and we were unprepared to defend ourselves from an unknown cult of secret forest dwellers. Unfair pre-judgement be damned, it didn‚Äôt appear they were a traditional sect of benevolent ‚Äòbelievers‚Äô, and I was terrified they would follow us, to our very doom. \n\nAbout a mile further down the trail, the real trouble started. My hopes of a safe escape from whatever secret shit we‚Äôd stumbled upon, immediately faded. Early darkness started to fall and my headlights revealed a dozen insurmountable logs lying across the roadway. The truck screeched to a halt just in time. We were completely blocked from moving forward, and away from them. I looked in vain for another way around the deliberate obstruction but even with my off-road capabilities, I couldn‚Äôt find anything. With that knowledge, I was forced to face an unpleasant truth. We had no choice but to go back the way we had come.\n\nAs much as we prayed they were still occupied in the middle of their arcane ceremonies, it was not to be. Our little unintended intrusion had ruffled some feathers. They were outside and holding candles, waiting on us. I would‚Äôve blown past the accursed place in a cloud of dust, but what I assumed was the high priest and a half dozen highly-placed clerics stood directly in our path. I wasn‚Äôt prepared to run over anyone; for what could‚Äôve only been a misunderstanding. \n\nInstead, I warning my terrified crew to be prepared for ‚Äòtrouble‚Äô, and to lock their doors. The crimson-robbed leader walked around to my side window and intimated for me to roll it down. Obviously I was hesitant to do so. We were beyond vulnerable and their aggressive posture was that of ‚Äòdamage control‚Äô. They wouldn‚Äôt block our path if they intended to allow us to leave. I was fully aware of the grave danger we were in. My ordinarily meek wife urged me to floor the gas pedal and flatten them, road-warrior style. Much to her chagrin, I was still a little bit uncomfortable with running over human beings, robed or otherwise. Not the least of which, because doing so could cause the truck wheels and undercarriage to bog down on their mangled bodies. I‚Äôm no fool. \n\nAgainst my better judgment, I cracked the glass a few inches to hear what their hooded priest had to say. I could only see the shadow of his forehead and nose beyond the robe. By that time the cult had surrounded our vehicle. I had the distinct feeling, he wanted to intimidate us for violating the sanctity of their secret meeting place. I only wanted to explain we had no idea the old wooden structure was even in use. As a matter of fact, I‚Äôd completely forgotten it‚Äôs existence until my family approached the immediate vicinity earlier. We absolutely didn‚Äôt want any trouble from them and hoped to convey that.\n\n‚ÄúGood evening to you, Sir. Our holy sect values our PRIVACY, as you might imagine. This sacred forest temple has been in service for many, many years. We don‚Äôt have any passers by, ordinarily. We aim to be left alone to worship our misunderstood Lord, as we see fit. We blocked the old logging passage across the mountain several years ago, to discourage interruptions or prying eyes.‚Äù\n\nHis words both confirmed my greatest fear and strangely reassured me. I felt like a peaceful resolution was going to be possible after all. His voice was deep and hypnotically charismatic. So much so, I almost lost my train of thought. I stammered something about wanting to show my family the old mountain trail in my new pickup, and how we were unaware their ‚Äòcongregation‚Äô was in session. Then I added that we also didn‚Äôt realize the road ahead was impassable. \n\nI reassured him with as much conviction as I could muster, that we meant no disrespect, and intended to leave them to their business. Afterward, a secretive discussion transpired between the robed ‚ÄòPope‚Äô and a few of his trusted ‚Äòcardinals‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt follow what was being said but I got the feeling our fates were being weighed by the cabal. My wife was as white as a ghost and the kids were deathly quiet, for the very first time in their young lives. \n\n‚ÄúA lovely family you have there.‚Äù; He remarked while glaring menacingly at them through the glass. May they forever remain in the warm arms of Satan‚Äôs loving embrace. Good evening to you all. I assume we won‚Äôt be seeing you again.‚Äù\n\nI swallowed hard and nodded an enthusiastic affirmative to him. Simultaneously a shutter escaped our breathless lips. I rolled up my window in deep relief. He and the others stepped out of our way and we crept slowly by the robbed clan. My hands shook uncontrollably for at least ten minutes afterward, and I kept one eye peeled on the rear view mirror. I‚Äôm not sure what nightmarish scenario I expected to witness occur behind us, but I knew what glowering drama was building up across from me, in the passenger seat. I was careful not to glance over at her. I could imagine the furious scowl of my wife, and the ‚ÄòI told you so!‚Äô expression it would convey. \n\nFortunately, we were both so relieved we had escaped our brush with evil, that she didn‚Äôt give me any more grief over buying the damn truck, or the perilous 4WD adventure. Take my hastily-learned advice, if there‚Äôs a safe way around any obstacle in your path, don‚Äôt try the risky route over it. That dilapidated, abandoned shack you encounter in the mountains might just be an active satanic cult valuing its privacy at all costs.",

        "text": "I still remember the play when Mason Gardner died. It was a designed run, should‚Äôve been routine. But he got sandwiched between two blockers, and the bigger one caught him helmet to helmet. He lay on the ground, not breathing as the crowd stood silent. Girls were crying. \n\nAll I could think was that God had finally answered one of my prayers.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the hell are you so happy about, fat boy?‚Äù said a voice, and I looked over to see Mason sitting in the empty seat right next to me.\n\nI sat paralyzed, and lifted my hand, pointing out to the field.\n\n‚ÄúWould you look at that? Guess I bit it,‚Äù he said. He didn‚Äôt even seem bothered, more like amused. ‚ÄúBet you thought this was gonna be the best day of your life, huh? I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it, you little fucking piggy. Now I‚Äôm gonna be with you 24/7. I‚Äôm gonna watch you piss. I‚Äôm gonna watch you shit. I‚Äôm gonna watch you stuff that little piggy face. Welcome to the suck, fat boy.‚Äù\n\nI grew up in the red half of California, out in a rural section of the central valley. Back in 2016, when I was a senior in high school, every house but mine had a Trump/Pence sign on the front lawn and a Ford truck in the driveway. \n\nThere wasn‚Äôt much to do there, and since 8th grade, Mason Gardner‚Äôs favorite hobby was making my life hell. At least before he died, I‚Äôd been able to escape him whenever I went home, retreating into a world of books and video games. After school, I‚Äôd usually try to bike home before I saw him, then plop on the couch and devour a bag of chips while I tore through old Arthur C. Clarke novels or played League of Legends. \n\nNow, there was no retreat. Mason was always there, lurking over my shoulder, whispering in my ear.\n\n‚ÄúNo wonder you‚Äôre still a virgin,‚Äù he‚Äôd whisper. ‚ÄúThe only exercise you ever get is lifting up Doritos to your disgusting little mouth. This is even sadder than I imagined when I was alive. I assumed you at least had a friend or something.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI did have a friend,‚Äù I said, wishing I could hurt him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou mean Chippy? That little twink you used to hang out with? That was like three years ago. You‚Äôre still not over that?‚Äù\n\nAll through middle school and freshman year, my best friend had been Herman Morales. He couldn‚Äôt have weighed more than a hundred pounds, but he had rounded cheeks like a chipmunk, hence Mason‚Äôs nickname for him. We‚Äôd been pretty much inseparable. After school, we‚Äôd play XBox or watch horror movies. \n\nHe had wanted to be a director, and he was pretty much addicted to filming everything. Like, he‚Äôd set up his iPhone on a little makeshift tripod and let it run for hours, just watching us talk shit while we played League, and then he‚Äôd edit it into a little two minute youtube video of all the funniest shit, and we‚Äôd get like 40 views. \n\nAs bad as Mason tormented me, the way he went after Herman had been a hundred times worse. Every time he spotted him down the hall, he‚Äôd yell, ‚ÄúHomo!‚Äù at the top of his lungs. I never did find out of Herman was actually into girls or guys. It wasn‚Äôt something he wanted to talk about. But either way, Mason‚Äôs taunting got under his skin.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt just verbal insults either. Mason made a point to basically body-check Herman if they ever got within ten feet of each other. Herman would just be walking along, probably taking a video of something going on at school and providing his patented narration, and then Mason would show up out of nowhere and send Herman sprawling onto the floor.\n\nAt one point, it had gotten so bad that Herman actually edited a ‚ÄúBody Check Megamix‚Äù video of himself getting hit like a dozen times. Then he overlaid it with this pretty catchy club beat, occasionally punctuated with Mason screaming ‚Äúhomo‚Äù at the top of his lungs. \n\nI told Herman to show it to the principal, but he just worried it would make things worse. He posted it on youtube and got like ten views.\n\nAnd then one day I got a hall from Herman‚Äôs mom. I could tell she was crying, struggling to tell me something in her broken English.\n\n‚ÄúHerman dead,‚Äù she said, thought sobs. ‚ÄúHerman die by rope.‚Äù\n\nAlmost no one came to the funeral. Herman didn‚Äôt have many friends at school, and his mom‚Äôs friends had their own hangups, both about suicide and the rumors Herman was gay. His mom said a brief eulogy in Spanish that I didn‚Äôt understand, and then they asked if anyone else wanted to say a word or two.\n\nI had a million things to say. About how I wished I‚Äôd said something earlier, or stood up to Mason. I wished I could have said that the world lost an awesome future film director, not to mention just a funny, good dude. \n\nBut I was a coward. I sat silently in my chair as the moment passed. The funeral ended without another speaker coming forward.\n\n‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even get up to talk about him,‚Äù laughed Mason. ‚ÄúI always knew you were a pussy, but now that I can read your thoughts I can see you‚Äôre *really* a pussy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúJust go the fuck away.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut not alone. See I‚Äôm in your head now, fat boy. Just like I was in Chippy‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt you remember just watching him crumble? Come on, really think. No matter how much he smiled and pretended *you* could see it. Every little word I said to him. Every time I tackled him in the middle of the hall. Well, guess what, piggy. That‚Äôs you now. Except, with you there‚Äôs no escape.‚Äù\n\nAnd Mason wasn‚Äôt kidding. All night, he‚Äôd keep me up making oinking noises, or screaming for me to wake up. At school, every time I walked by a cute girl, Mason would remind me how disgusting she thought I was. Every time I lost my breath climbing stairs, he‚Äôd oink again.\n\nAnd I have to admit, it got to me. Because it was never going to end. He was just going to stay in my ear forever until I chose to end things. It was just a matter of how long I could hold out.\n\nThe worst thing of all was that everyone at school was mourning Mason‚Äôs loss. The guys on the team dedicated the rest of the season to him. Girls came out of the woodwork, saying they‚Äôd dated, vying for sympathy. Random guys who barely knew him talked about what a fun dude he‚Äôd been.\n\nAnd Mason ate it all up. He‚Äôd air high-five the guys with his ghost hands and bury his face in the girls breasts, making motorboat sounds, even as they cried over his loss.\n\n‚ÄúThink they‚Äôre gonna shed a tear when *you* come join me on this side?‚Äù Mason asked. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt even know your name. You‚Äôre gonna fade from memory in ten seconds flat, and then in 20 years, they‚Äôre gonna half-remember you as that one fat kid that killed himself senior year.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true,‚Äù I said, but I could tell my resolve was weakening.\n\nThat Friday, a school-wide memorial was going to be held during last period, billed as a time of mourning and healing. When they asked for volunteers to speak and share stories about Mason, the list was a mile long. \n\nAs for me, I got conscripted to run the audio visuals, complete with a slideshow one of his exes had made set to two different Coldplay songs. \n\n‚ÄúGood shit,‚Äù said Mason as we finished watching the slideshow on my laptop. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to let you live until after the memorial. It‚Äôs gonna be sick. Not a dry eye in the house.‚Äù\n\nThe rest of that week would have been bad enough, but then something even worse happened: Mason learned how to hurt me physically. \n\nIt started with the slightest of taps. I woke in the middle of a storm and assumed water was dripping from the ceiling and down into my face. It wasn‚Äôt until I opened my eyes that I saw Mason standing over me, flicking my nose with a calloused finger.\n\n‚ÄúGot your nose, piggy,‚Äù he whispered.\n\nFrom there it got worse. I‚Äôd be walking down the hall at school, only to trip seemingly out of nowhere, my papers flying everywhere. Mason thought it was just about the funniest shit he‚Äôd ever seen.\n\n‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd I waste so much time tackling Chippy?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre way funnier when you fall. Chalk it up to life‚Äôs regrets, I guess.‚Äù\n\nThen, as I was walking home, he tripped me right by a busy street and I went tumbling into traffic. For a moment, my heart beat 200 beats a minute, as I watched a minivan bear down on me. Then it swerved at the last second. I was alive.\n\nOver on the sidewalk, Mason laughed and laughed as I lay in the street trembling. And for the first time, I was truly afraid of him. Not as some annoyance, but as something inhuman, some kind of embodiment of inevitable death. Maybe he'd drive me to do it myself. Maybe he'd do it for me. Either way,  I knew I couldn‚Äôt beat him.\n\n‚ÄúNot long now,‚Äù he smirked. ‚ÄúI know, I know. I want you there for the memorial. But watching you get pancaked would have been fucking funny.‚Äù\n\nFinally, the day of the memorial arrived. For all I knew, it was going to be the last day of my life. I ate ice cream for breakfast and walked to school on full autopilot, like I was already dead inside.\n\nAt the assembly, we listened to speech after speech about Mason. How he always made everyone laugh. I played a highlight reel of his best games, and the crowd ate it up, erupting as if the touchdowns were happening in real time.\n\n‚ÄúGod, what a fucking reel,‚Äù said Mason. ‚ÄúI definitely could have gone pro. That‚Äôs the thing that pisses me off most about you, you fat fuck. You‚Äôre still alive, and I‚Äôm here. And you‚Äôre not gonna do shit with your life. I could be scoring TDs and banging the rest of the cheerleading team. And you‚Äôre sitting on your ass playing games and crying yourself to sleep.‚Äù\n\nThe highlight reel ended. It was time for the slideshow now, the capstone on Mason‚Äôs glory. Mason beamed as the crowd grew silent. My hand hovered over the play button.\n\n‚ÄúWhat you waiting for, piggy? Play it.‚Äù\n\nBut I was too busy accessing my Google Drive and navigating to old videos. I‚Äôd kept Herman‚Äôs work, you see. Every last minute of it.\n\nI switched the mic in the booth to live and spoke.\n\n‚ÄúAnd now, one last video to help us remember Mason Gardner,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúPlease enjoy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you doing, piggy?‚Äù Mason asked. And for the first time since he‚Äôd materialized next to me in that football stadium, he looked surprised. Maybe even scared.\n\nI hit play on the Body Check Megamix.\n\nA different kind of highlight reel played now. Herman‚Äôs highlights. The crowd watched as Mason tackled poor Herman two dozen times, screaming obscenities. Herman‚Äôs catchy song played as we watched tackle after tackle. Hit after hit. \n\nThe crowd began to murmur and boo, but I just smiled. By the time the assistant principal ran into the booth to shut me down it was too late. The video had played. Mason‚Äôs legacy was sealed.\n\nFor a second, everything was silent. And then I saw one small figure clapping in the back of the auditorium. He shot me a big toothy smile. And then he disappeared.\n\nMason‚Äôs eyes went wide as he realized who we'd just seen. \n\n‚ÄúChippy?‚Äù\n\nAs it turned out, that was the last word Mason ever spoke. \n\nFor some reason, from that day on, his voice didn‚Äôt seem to work anymore. He was still there, a lurking presence, but it was like someone had pressed the mute button. I could tell he was screaming, shouting every epithet in the book. But nothing was getting through any more.\n\nThe last time I saw him was on the bus as it took me down to L.A. for college. He was sitting there next to me like usual. Trying to yell, trying to flick at me with completely no effect. And then when we reached the county line, it was like he hit a wall. The bus kept going, but Mason was trapped. And before I knew it, he‚Äôd disappeared in the rearview mirror.",

        "text": "This all started about a month ago, so here goes. I know it sounds crazy.\n\nI love horror movies. About a year ago I decided to watch one every night before I went to bed. I don't know what made me want to do this, but I guess I thought it would make me have a greater fear tolerance or something. Anyway, even after watching all these movies, I have always kept my closet door closed while I sleep. Despite whatever horrors I watch before I sleep, and despite how little fear I now feel, something about sleeping with it open makes me uneasy. I often cannot sleep if I know the closet door is open. About a month ago, I got home from school, and as usual decided to put on a scary movie before bed. I get home pretty late, so I usually go right to bed anyways. I turned the movie on, and unsurprisingly it didn't scare me too much, so I headed to bed. I entered my room, took my clothes off, and shut the closet door. I'd done that for 16 years. No biggie. But when I woke up the next morning, I saw that my closet door was open. That was weird. I knew I had closed it the night before, how was it open? I didn't really think much of it. Maybe I forgot to close it and was too tired to care, or maybe my mom opened it to get something while I was asleep. It didn't bother me too much, and I went about the rest of my day completely normally. When I got home that day, I was extremely tired, so, just like the previous night, I turned on another movie. I watched this one about a woman with Alzheimer's. Doesn't sound too scary, but something about it made me feel paranoid. I felt like something was watching me as a trudged up the stairs to my room. Just like the previous night, I entered my room, took my clothes off, and shut my closet door. I then jumped into bed and pulled my head under the covers, and shut my eyes. Some weird dreams plagued me, but he movie freaked me out so no big deal once again. I woke up at around 2:30 to the sound of scratching. It was so quiet that I almost didn't notice it, but something was definitely scratching at one of the doors. It only took a few more seconds of listening to pinpoint the sounds location. My closet. My blood ran cold. I immediately cursed myself for being scared. It was probably a mouse or something, chill the fuck out. I just closed my eyes again and went back to sleep. The next morning, I got out of bed, and opened my closet to get dressed. I glanced at the inside of the door and I saw them. Three claw marks. They were huge. Much bigger then any animal I could think of. I grabbed my clothes and slammed the door shut. My heart was pounding but once again, I cursed myself for being so scared. Maybe a cat got in and left fucking massive claw marks. I made myself forget about it and left for school. The whole day my mind was racing. What the hell could have left those claw marks? for the first time, I didn't want school to end. I didn't want to go home. despite all my praying and wishing, eventually school ended, and my after school activities ended, and I knew I had to go home. As I opened the door, I noticed that my parents weren't home. Weird they never really leave, but who cares. I turned on what would be the last scary movie I would watch for a while. Halfway through the movie, I once again got the feeling of being watched. That's when I heard the scratching again. It was louder this time, but it was definitely coming from my room. I turned the volume all the way up on the tv, hoping to drown out the scratching sound. As the movie got closer and closer to ending, the feeling of dread in my stomach got worse and worse. I finally built up the courage to head up to my room. Just like the previous nights, I went in my room, took my clothes off, and shut my closet. I woke up again at about 2:30 to a cracking sound. This time the noise was loud. Way louder than the scratching. I stayed frozen for what felt like forever, until I finally worked up the courage to peek out. The second I lifted my head out, my eyes shot to the closet door. As expected, it was cracked open, but this time it was open enough to see inside. I stared at the opening for minutes, until I saw something. Two white eyes were staring back at me. I was frozen. Then I heard that awful crackling noise, and I watched as four long black fingers curled around the door. I was fucking petrified. I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, I couldn't breathe. I thought it couldn't get any worse, when I saw the creatures lips peel back. It had hundreds of teeth. Too many to count. It stared at me, smiling, for 10 minutes, until finally, with another sickening crackling, it retreated back into my closet.\n\nThat was about 3 nights ago and I haven't slept since. Does anyone know what to do about this??",

        "text": "You know, they say the human brain isn't so much an information processor as it is an information ignorer. Think about it: At this moment you're not thinking about the skin on the top of your left foot are you? Or at least, you weren't until I said that. \n\nThe same way you're not thinking about how that wall looks behind your screen, even though your eyes are transferring data about it constantly, am I right? \n\nEveryone's been through the experience of being unable to find a toy or shirt in their room until their mom walks in and picks it up off the ground even if it was hiding in plain view. \n\nYour brain and body are constantly, continually, effectively, causing you to ignore the vast majority of the sensory information that you receive so you can better focus on what's \"important.\"\n\nAt least, that's my current best theory as to why it took me falling face-first into a notebook for me to notice it. I picked the notebook up and flipped it open, scanning the stained red cover. My eyes slid across it as if the material were slippery, my mind seemingly attempting to get me to ignore it. I fought, gripping the page and opening the cover.\n\nA child had written on the inside with a pencil. *Ben Christiansen, Fourth Grade Enlgish Mrs. Richards.* \n\nMy mouth felt dry. Just below the scrawled writing was my own handwriting.\n\n\"Love ya Benny Bro! Mrs. Richards was my English teacher too, so I'll tell her to take it easy on you.\" I'd apparently written below one of the smiling hearts that I like to draw. I had absolutely no memory of writing that message.\n\nMy last name is Christiansen, but I have no relatives named Ben, and I'm an only child. A child sharing my last name and some phantom writing typically wouldn't have been enough to freak me out like this, but the notebook felt so profoundly *wrong.* It felt like I was staring into one of the floodlights at the high school football stadium. My mind rebelled, telling me to throw it away, to forget, to stop looking.\n \nMy arm itched, and I brushed it away absent-mindedly as I shot to my feet. \n\nMy mom was in her study working on the computer. \"Mom,\" I called out. \"Take a look at this.\" \n\n\"Hmmm?\" She said, still staring at the computer with a politely disinterested expression. \n\n\"Have you seen this notebook before?\" I asked, laying it out on the desk.\n\n\"What notebook?\" she asked. \n\n\"This one.\" I pointed to the open page where the child's writing laid beside my own. \n\nMy mom gave the barest of glances before looking back at the computer. \"No Honey, and I don't have time for whatever this game is.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I said, pointing down at the page. \"It's right--\" Something bumped my finger. I pulled my hand back, startled to discover that new writing had appeared.\n\n*How many doors are there on the second floor?* \n\n\"How many doors are there on the second floor?\" I read aloud. How had new writing... \n\nSomething caught my sweatshirt as I stepped back, snatching up the notebook. I pulled myself free and headed for the stairs.\n\nI ran up the stairs and began counting. There were three doors, of course. A bathroom, my parent's room, my room, and...\n\nI stared at the fourth door, my eyes gliding across a pair of Minecraft and Fortnite posters the way they had the notebook. I'd never noticed those posters before, though the room faced directly opposite the room I'd lived in for fifteen years.\n\nI opened this new door, my hand and mind rebelling as I stepped into a toy-and-clothes strewn eight-year-old-boys room. I stepped forward feeling lightheaded, unsure of what to do. \n\n\"Mom?\" I called out weakly.\n\nThen the lights turned off on their own. I stared at the single switch as it moved back to lit, trying to process what I was seeing. The switch was somehow blocked, covered by a pink fleshy...\n\nMy eyes widened, following the obstruction and focusing, fighting against my every instinct. A young boy stood in the room with me, eyes red with tears and nose dripping with snot. \n\n\"Julie?\" he called out between sobs. \"Can you finally see me?\"",

        "text": "I don‚Äôt remember when it started. I first noticed it a few weeks ago when I went to the grocery store. There were so many cats around.\n\nSeeing cats isn‚Äôt uncommon in a rural town such as mine. Many people owned cats, and there are quite a few strays around.\n\nIt‚Äôs just that you never really noticed them unless you looked. Most cats are rather shy with strangers. You‚Äôd occasionally see a stray walking down the street or sleeping on someone‚Äôs porch, but that was about it.\n\nThat day, during my five-minute walk to the grocery story, I saw at least ten of them. They were sitting on the sidewalks, playing with each other, and even approaching people.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I love cats. I just wondered where they‚Äôd all come from. They were also extremely friendly. They‚Äôd walk up to you, meowing and rubbing against your leg, desperate to be petted. I almost tripped multiple when one of them couldn‚Äôt stop sneaking around my legs. I petted the little guy for a bit, and thinking he was satisfied, continued on.\n\nWhen I got home, Simba, my four-year-old tabby, noticed it right away. The moment he smelled the stray on me, he hissed at me before he booked it and hid under the bed for the rest of the day.\n\nSimba‚Äôs special. He‚Äôs extremely skittish, easily scared, doesn‚Äôt like people, and, as I learned that day, doesn‚Äôt seem to like other cats either. I love the little guy to death, but our relationship‚Äôs more that of roommates sharing the same apartment.\n\nWhat he loved the most was to sit outside on the balcony, watching birds, people, and even the occasional stray. Yet, in case he‚Äôd get a bit too excited, I installed a cat safety net. There was no telling what would happen if he‚Äôd ever skip out on me.\n\nHe, too, had noticed the influx of strays in the area, and I‚Äôd often find him watching them with watchful eyes. Every once in a while, he‚Äôd even hiss at those who dared to come closer.\n\nI guess they made him a little restless. He became even more skittish during these weeks, and he‚Äôd often hide under the bed or other secret places around the apartment.\n\nThis morning, to my surprise, I found him outside on the balcony. I was a little confused because I didn‚Äôt remember letting him outside.\n\nThe moment he saw me, he began meowing, desperate to be let back inside. Shit, I remembered. I went for a smoke before I headed to bed. He probably snuck outside, and I accidentally locked him out all night.\n\n‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sorry, little dude. I didn‚Äôt know you were outside.‚Äù\n\nHe answered my apology with a hearty meow and began rubbing against my leg, purring loudly.\n\n‚ÄúWhat happened to you? Are you that happy to be back inside?‚Äù I said, laughing, and to my surprise, he let me pet him.\n\nAfter I‚Äôd fed him and prepared myself some coffee, he joined me at the computer. For a few minutes, he sat by my side, watching me before he jumped on my lap, making no indications of ever move again.\n\nI was more than surprised. As I said, Simba doesn‚Äôt like people, and while he tolerated me, he‚Äôd never jumped on my lap before.\n\n‚ÄúGuess you like me after all, do you?‚Äù\n\nWhile I was reading the news and drinking my coffee, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder where this change came from.\n\n‚ÄúIs it because of all those strays outside? Are you scared of them, little dude? Don‚Äôt worry, they won‚Äôt be able to get in.‚Äù\n\nFor the next couple of hours, he happily slept on my lap while I worked.\n\nAs I absent-mindedly petted him, I suddenly noticed something. It was a sort of bump on his back. When my fingers went over it a second time, I could‚Äôve sworn I felt something squirm below his skin. In an instant, I pulled my hand back.\n\nBy now, he‚Äôd woken up and was staring at me.\n\n‚ÄúHey, what have you got there? Are you hurt?‚Äù\n\nI checked his back right away, going over it again and again, but found no hint of the bump. Eventually, I gave up, and reasoned it might have been some sort of muscle spasm during sleep.\n\nBefore long, morning turned to afternoon, and eventually early evening.\n\nWhen I saw it was already seven, I cursed. The damned grocery store would close in about an hour, and I still needed to get some food.\n\nIn a careful, but swift motion, I put down a protesting Simba and put on my shoes and jacket. Then I opened the balcony door, asking if he wanted to go outside and keep watch over the neighborhood like he usually did. Yet he just sat there, not moving, staring at me.\n\n‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs up? Don‚Äôt you want to go outside? Are you still scared of those strays?‚Äù\n\nFor another few seconds, he continued staring at me before he slowly made his way toward the balcony door, vanishing outside. I closed it behind him, so the apartment wouldn‚Äôt cool down, and went on my merry way.\n\nThe moment I opened the apartment building‚Äôs door, one of the many strays greeted me. It was an orange tabby who now called the area around our apartment complex his home.\n\nI gently shoed the cat away so I could step outside and noticed three others watching me from the bushes nearby.\n\n‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt play with you guys. I‚Äôve got to go to the store.‚Äù\n\nWith that, I set out down the street. I noticed just how many cats there were by now. It wasn‚Äôt just a few, it had to be dozens. They were everywhere: out in the streets, on the sidewalks and in front of people‚Äôs homes.\n\nMy eyes wandered around before they came to rest on a cat further down the road. It was an orange tabby. When the cat heard my approaching footsteps and turned to face me, I looked up.\n\nI saw the crooked tail and the scratch mark on his little nose. It was the same cat who‚Äôd greeted me at the door. How‚Äôd he gotten here so quickly?\n\nWell, cats are fast, I thought, and I‚Äôm not exactly a fast walker myself.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a quick one, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I said, as it began rubbing against my leg.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, I know you want to play, but I can‚Äôt, sorry.‚Äù\n\nFor a moment, the cat stopped and began meowing in protest, almost as it had understood my words.\n\nThen it just sat down in front of me, staring at me. For a second, I couldn‚Äôt help but be weirded out. \n\nI stepped past him and continued on. Yet I couldn‚Äôt help but feel watched and when I turned around, he was still there, unmoving except for his eyes, which trailed after me.\n\nFreaking cats. Why‚Äôd they have to be so weird?\n\nI soon arrived at the store. In the evening, it was always packed. It seemed I wasn‚Äôt the only one who waited till the last minute to get his shopping done.\n\nToday, however, the atmosphere felt different. At first, I couldn‚Äôt say what it was, but then I realized it. Some of the other customers were strangely friendly. They were beaming as they wandered through the aisles, wishing other shoppers a good evening, or even striking up a conversation. Now, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs just a bit weird, especially at closing time.\n\nEventually, I shrugged it off, paid for my food, and left.\n\nOutside, I could already see an assortment of strays and a bunch of kids playing with them.\n\nOnce more, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder where all those cats had come from. In my head, I tried to think of a plausible scenario, but nothing made sense.\n\nI counted them. At least a dozen were hanging around the store, but there were so many more out in the streets. It seemed there was even more now than when I‚Äôd entered the store a mere ten minutes ago.\n\nFor a moment, I watched the group of kids, and saw that they were playing with an orange tabby. It had the same crooked tail and the same scratch mark on his nose. Guess it had finally found someone to play with.\n\nAs I walked from the store, however, I saw it again, this time crossing the street ahead of me.\n\nMy steps slowed down. How the hell was that cat moving so quickly?\n\nI turned around to look over my shoulder. The kids were still there, still playing with a cat, with an orange tabby.\n\nA shiver went down my spine. Then I told myself my eyes had to be playing tricks on me. Hell, maybe it‚Äôs just two cats who look really similar. With so many around, it was possible.\n\nAnd yet, I felt my steps speeding up as almost unconsciously hurried home. When I reached the building, my eyes grew wide.\n\n‚ÄúHow in the hell had he gotten out?‚Äù I cursed to myself.\n\nThere he was, Simba, outside, on the ground, scanning the area.\n\n‚ÄúDammit, the freaking net must‚Äôve a hole, or one of those damned strays tore it apart.‚Äù\n\nFor a moment, I opened my mouth to call out to him, but then closed it again. Simba was way too skittish and way too easily scared. There was no telling what he‚Äôd do if I‚Äôd just call out to him.\n\nInstead, I carefully approached him, hoping to scoop him up and bring him back home.\n\nYet he started to move and began making his way alongside the building. I watched as he checked out the neighboring balconies one by one, and wondered if he‚Äôd jump onto one of them, but no.\n\nEventually, he snuck around the building‚Äôs corner and down an old staircase. It led towards the basement where the maintenance area and boiler room were located.\n\nI quickly followed him, hoping to catch him at the bottom of the stairs\n\nWhen I reached them, however, there was no hint of Simba. Instead, I found the door slightly ajar.\n\n‚ÄúOh for fuck‚Äôs sake, you little dummy,‚Äù I cursed.\n\nThis was a worst-case scenario. I‚Äôd heard way too many horror stories about cats getting trapped in basements or garages and starving to death.\n\nI pushed open the door, expecting to find a maintenance worker fixing some sort of problem, but was greeted with nothing but gaping darkness.\n\nBut then why was the damned door even open?\n\nFrom afar, I could hear something dripping onto the floor, most likely a leaking pipe. Maybe one of my neighbors had noticed a problem, checked out the basement and hadn‚Äôt closed the door. Good going, idiot!\n\nI put down my backpack and pushed it against the door so I wouldn‚Äôt get trapped myself. When I hit the light switch, nothing happened. Cursing, I activated my phone‚Äôs flashlight and set out to find my cat.\n\nThe moment I stepped inside, I noticed how moist the air was. Even the walls were wet with condensation and further ahead I could see puddles on the floor. Yep, a leak, I thought to myself.\n\n‚ÄúHey, Simba, little dude, where are you?‚Äù I whispered in a quiet, friendly voice.\n\nI tip-toed on, scanning the ground, careful not to scare him.\n\n‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs get out of here.‚Äù\n\nNothing. Not a hint of the cat. I cursed inwardly. Where the hell are you? Don‚Äôt tell me he crawled behind some pips or under the boilers. God, you stupid cat!\n\nDarting my phone around, I illuminated an old shelf, then an assortment of pipes, but I still couldn‚Äôt find him.\n\nWhen the beam hit one puddle, I saw that the water was strangely reddish. For a moment, I stared at it. It had to be rust, considering the age of the building.\n\nOnce again, I called out for the cat, but all I heard was the same quiet sound. By now, however, my ears had adjusted. It sounded almost like something was moving or squishing around in the water on the floor.\n\nIt was coming from the boiler ahead of me, or rather, from something that was behind it. I saw that the strange reddish water almost flooded the back of the room. When I stepped into it, however, I noticed it was too thick, almost syrupy. In disgust, I pulled my foot back.\n\nThen I froze. Was this... blood? Shit! The open door, the broken light switch. Don‚Äôt tell me some maintenance worker had gone down here and had hurt himself, hurt himself badly, given the amount of blood. What if he was bleeding out right over there?\n\nIn an instant, I rushed forward, stepped past the boiler, and illuminated the area in front of me.\n\nEverything was covered in blood, and right in the center was Simba, sitting in front of something.\n\nAt first I really thought it was a body, a torn apart human body, but it was too big for that.\n\nIt was nothing but flesh, a giant heap or blob of flesh stuck to the wall. I opened my mouth to tell Simba to get the hell away from whatever this was, but then...\n\nThe thing began moving, heaving, almost as if it was breathing. All the while, it pumped out more of the blood that covered the floor.\n\nMy eyes grew wide, not understanding what I was seeing.\n\nWhen I looked at Simba again, I saw how strange he looked. His body was all wrong, deformed, almost as if he‚Äôd melted. It began convulsing, shaking, and I saw something squirm inside of him. Then a disgusting fleshy tentacle burst from his back and slithered toward the disgusting blob.\n\nIn a trance, I watched as it probed the blob, and then, finding an orifice, contacted it.\n\nThe blob in front of him moved again, shook, but this time I saw where the movement was coming from. It wasn‚Äôt the blob itself, it was something inside of it. I saw bodies, tiny bodies. I could make out skinless heads, legs and tails. It was cats, skinless, half-formed cats.\n\nSimba‚Äôs body was almost a puddle by now. At that moment, two of the things inside the blob began clawing their way outward.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù escaped my mouth.\n\nRight away, the two skinless creatures in front of me started hissing and meowing at me.\n\nFinally, the trance was broken. I screamed in terror, cringed back, but after only a few steps, I stumbled over my feet and crashed to the floor.\n\nThe phone clattered away, its flashlight illuminating the ceiling above me.\n\nThere was another one of these things, another fleshy blob stuck to the ceiling. This one, however, was much, much bigger. It, too, was moving, similarly heaving and stretching. And inside of it, there were other things, things that twitch, trying to make their way outside. But they were so much bigger than cats.\n\nFor a second, I couldn‚Äôt move, could only stare at the surreal sight above me in stunned horror.\n\nThen, the blob burst open and another of the tentacles slithered outward. No, not just outward, toward me.\n\nIn an instant, I was back on my feet, then at the door and finally outside.\n\nI was back inside my apartment mere moments later.\n\nI was shaking and out of it. What the fuck had I just seen? This couldn‚Äôt be real, this couldn‚Äôt-\n\nI saw something moving out of the corner of my eye. Something was staring at me, and when I darted around, I saw glowing eyes from inside my wardrobe.\n\nWith a scream, and ready to beat whatever was in there, I tore it open.\n\nI didn‚Äôt understand what I was seeing. Right there, huddled under a stack of clothing, was Simba.\n\n‚ÄúHow the hell are you here? You were just outside, so...‚Äù\n\nMy voice trailed off when the smell hit me. He‚Äôd soiled himself.\n\nYet he made no intention of moving. Instead, he just stared at me with wide, anxious eyes, trying to push himself deeper under the clothes. Slowly, ever so slowly, afraid to see his body contort and change, I reached out my hand. At first, he hissed at me, but then he began smelling my fingers as usual.\n\nI didn‚Äôt understand. If he was here, then the one I‚Äôd followed must‚Äôve been a... fake?\n\nI thought about all those strays, about the orange tabby, and what I‚Äôd just seen inside those disgusting blob-like things. Oh dear god, don‚Äôt tell me all those strays...\n\nWith weak legs, I stumbled towards my balcony to check just how many of the things were out there.\n\nThe moment I pulled aside the curtain, however, I found myself face to face with Simba.\n\nI jerked around, but saw he was still inside the wardrobe, still hidden under my clothes, his eyes trained on the imposter outside.\n\nAnother one, it was another fake Simba.\n\n‚ÄúYou... Get the fuck away!‚Äù I screamed at the thing through the balcony door.\n\nYet it didn‚Äôt leave. Instead, it approached the door, pushing itself against it, letting out a meow as if to beg me to let him come inside.\n\nAt that moment, I realized it. This thing had been with me all day. It had been the one sitting on my lap while Simba was hiding inside the wardrobe. The trick had worked. Its fucking trick had worked!\n\nSuddenly, I grew angry, and in an instant, I tore open the balcony door to stomp whatever this thing was.\n\nWhen my foot came down hard on its body, it burst open and I saw an assortment of disgusting tentacles slithered out from it. Right away, they reached out for my shoe, trying to get a hold of it. \n\nScreaming, I stomped on the thing again and again. Finally, when I thought it was dead, when it was nothing but a disgusting puddle of reddish goo, I slumped to the ground.\n\nYet, it wasn‚Äôt over. I cringed back when the thing started moving again, pulled itself together and slithered towards the corner of the balcony. There it melted away through a small gap between the balcony railing and the wall. It washed outside before it reformed itself into a cat and dashed away.\n\nFor a long moment, I just sat there, utterly confused and half-laughing.\n\nThen my eyes wandered over the area in front of the building. I could see them, the cats. They were everywhere, all staring at me. No, watching me.\n\nI was back inside a moment later.\n\nSomething was going on, something bad. I had to tell people, had to get help.\n\nThe police, I decided. I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone, but found it empty. I cursed. When I‚Äôd fallen down in that damned basement, I‚Äôd lost it! It was still down there! Fuck!\n\nThe station then. I‚Äôd go to the station and tell them what I‚Äôd seen. They‚Äôd know what to do, or they‚Äôd call someone who did.\n\nThe moment I left my apartment, however, my neighbor‚Äôs door opened.\n\nHe was a grumpy old man, the type who‚Äôd scoff and yell at everyone. A textbook asshole, so to speak.\n\nWhen I saw him now, however, he was beaming.\n\n‚ÄúWell hello there, neighbor. How are you doing this evening?‚Äù\n\nI just stared at him.\n\n‚ÄúI... the police because there‚Äôs...‚Äù\n\nMy voice trailed off when he reached out and put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n‚ÄúNow, now, young man, just tell me what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs no need to bother the police.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, I mean, yes, there is! There are things below the...‚Äù\n\nOnce more, I couldn‚Äôt continue. I felt it again. The same strange feeling I‚Äôd felt when I‚Äôd petted the imposter cat‚Äôs back. Something was moving, or better, squirming, below the skin of his hand.\n\nIn an instant, I shook it off and cringed back.\n\n‚ÄúGet the fuck away from me!‚Äù I screamed at him.\n\nHis friendly expression, however, didn‚Äôt waver.\n\n‚ÄúMy, if it isn‚Äôt Mr. Schneider,‚Äù a voice reached us.\n\nIt was another one of my neighbors, an older lady from upstairs. Her face, too, was extremely friendly, and her mouth was twisted into a disgustingly sweet smile.\n\nShe slowly came closer, positioning herself in the center of the hallway that led to the entrance door.\n\n‚ÄúNot going to let me leave, are you?‚Äù I spat at them.\n\nI was about to chance it, to just dart past her, but then I heard more footsteps, and saw more people coming down the stairs. They, too, were beaming.\n\nRight at that moment, my neighbor reached out for me again, trying to get a hold of me.\n\nIn an instant, I darted back into my apartment and locked the door.\n\nOne glance through the spyglass told me they were all still outside, just standing in front of my door.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre all right? Do you need help?‚Äù one of them spoke up.\n\nI retreated back to the living room. This couldn‚Äôt be real. It was just the cats, wasn‚Äôt it?\n\nThat thing on the ceiling, though. It had been so much bigger, and so had the things inside of it.\n\nI remembered all those smiling, overly friendly people at the grocery store. Oh dear god...\n\nHow long has this been going on? How many people have been replaced by now?\n\nI can still hear them outside. They are still calling for me in their friendly, jolly voices, but there‚Äôs more of them now.\n\nBut I won‚Äôt give up and just wait till they come to get me. No, I‚Äôm going to take my chances. If I can‚Äôt leave via the front door, I‚Äôll try the balcony. People have to know what‚Äôs going on here. People have to be warned.\n\nThere‚Äôs one thing, however, one thing I know. These things aren‚Äôt like animals. They aren‚Äôt merely driven by instinct.\n\nThere‚Äôs a method to this madness, a plan. The cats were only the first step, a way to get close to us and to get us to let our guard down. \n\nNo, these things are smart, [and this is an invasion.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": "I've  always been good friends with one of my cousins, Cole, who's the same age I am.¬† The two of us  were...not quite inseparable, but we always did get along very well together, and were often found together, both in school (as we'd always wound up in the same class together throughout elementary school) and outside of it.\n\nWhen we were 12 and in the 6th grade, I was hanging out with Cole on a Friday afternoon around the later part of of May, and we were psyched at the start of the weekend.¬† We'd wound up at his house, since he  didn't live too far from me, and at one point my mom called to say that our grandpa was in the hospital.¬† While the issue with our grandpa wasn't expected to be life-threatening, he was being kept at the hospital overnight for observation, and both my parents and Cole's were planning on staying with him and grandma at the hospital (since my mom   and her sister were the two of their sibling who lived close by).¬† I was told that I was given the OK to stay at Cole's house for the night,   with Cole's 15 year old brother Hunter being \"in charge\" while our parents  were out.\n\nThis was fine  by us.¬† I got along well enough with Hunter, and he was never the bossy older brother/cousin that some of my other friends said they had to put up with.¬† We ordered out for pizza, and enjoyed goofing off as boys  that age tend to do.¬† At around 9 or so, there was a knock at the front   door, and Cole went to answer it.¬† I was a bit curious as to who it  could be at that time of the night, and so I watched from a ways back.¬† At the door were two older guys.¬† They said that they were with the  city  and that they were investigating reports about the water pressure supposedly being bad in the neighborhood.¬† They asked Cole if his  parents were home, and when Cole said they were \"unavailable\" at that moment (which we were told to say to strangers if our parents weren't home) the guys started asking a bunch of questions about how the water pressure was in the house and if they could come inside to check.  Hunter came over at that point and politely told the guys that the water  pressure was fine and perhaps they should move on to check on other homes in the neighborhood.¬† The guys seemed reluctant to leave but turned and walked away after Hunter started closing the door.\n\nAfter the door was shut we looked at each other and shrugged, but didn't think too much of it after that and went back to goofing off.   Eventually, we decided to go to bed.¬† Cole and Hunter shared a bedroom, and we all agreed that I'd sleep in there with them, rather than me  hitting the sack on the couch or something like that, so that we could  talk while we fell asleep, and Hunter grabbed a sleeping bag out of their camping supplies for me.¬† When we got into their bedroom, they stripped  down to their briefs, and I remembered Cole had mentioned to  me once a while back that they had started sleeping in just their underwear.¬† Since I hadn't originally planned on staying the night, I  hadn't  brought anything with me from home as far as overnight stuff,  but since I wasn't in the mood to sleep in my clothes, I stripped down to my briefs as well, though I felt a bit embarrassed, even though we  were all guys there and I knew they wouldn't say anything or be  judgemental.\n\nThey climbed into  their beds and I quickly crawled into the sleeping bag, and after talking for a while about random stuff we eventually fell asleep.¬† Early  the next morning I got up because I had to pee, and so I quietly got out of the sleeping bag and went and did my business in the bathroom.¬† On the way back to the bedroom I heard something in the family room, which was on the opposite end of the house from the bedrooms and particular bathroom I was using.¬† I didn't pay too much attention to it   at the time, thinking it must be either Cole or Hunter, until I got back into the bedroom and realized that both of them were still in  there.  Trying not to panic, I woke them and told them that I thought  someone  was in the house.¬† They quietly followed me, and the moment we walked into the family room we saw the two guys from the night before in  there,  and it was rather clear they were robbing the place.¬† One of them started moving towards us as he pulled out a wicked-looking knife.\n\nThe three of us promptly raced to the front door, somehow managed to get it unlocked and open, and we fled outside.¬† As luck would have it a cop was driving by at that particular moment.¬† We quickly flagged him down and told him about the two guys in the house.¬† The cop called for backup, and within a couple of minutes several other cops were there, and they proceeded to enter the house, and after some searching they caught the two guys.¬† The cops figured out that the two guys must have   entered from a window in the laundry room that had a broken latch, and had probably targeted that house because, while it wasn't empty, they'd probably realized that there were no adults there and figured that if we discovered them, we could be more easily dealt with than adults.\n\nTo add insult to injury, while we were waiting outside while the cops searched the house (both to get the two guys and make sure that there was no one else with them), some of the neighbors came out to see what the commotion was about, and this included some kids who went to the same school as Cole and me, including a few who were in our 6th grade class with us.¬† It was during that time that the three of us realized that we'd never had the chance to get dressed, so, just like in the stereotypical nightmare, we had to stand outside in full view of everyone in just our briefs for what seemed liked forever before being allowed back inside.  When we went back to school on Monday, Cole and I had to put up with more than a bit of snickering, stares, and ribbing for the next few weeks until school ended for the summer.",

        "text": "This happened about two years ago now, and I can't keep quiet about it much longer. Officially speaking, my name is Jimmy Davis, once known as the young man who went missing for a week in central Wisconsin. The NDA I signed says otherwise. I don't remember my birth name, to be frank. All I remember is the events leading up to my new life. \n\nJames Richard Davis is dead. He died under mysterious circumstances during a missing persons investigation. He was the missing person. When they found me on the edge of that marsh, struggling to breathe, they had exactly what they were looking for.\n\nI had dubious beginnings at best. No record exists of me anywhere. I was just some nobody who got pulled out of a marsh during a missing person's investigation, who happened to look kind of like the guy they were looking for. If it weren't for company-mandated background checks and fingerprints for summer camp staff, the investigation would have been concluded then and there. But nothing matched up, my story, my fingerprints, nothing.\n\nThe search continued for three more days, only concluded once they found Jimmy's lower jaw, and used dental records to confirm it. The rest of the body was never officially found, but the remains they did find led to confusion that the investigators decided wasn't worth it. I saw the photos of the body. I don't think I'll ever forget what had been done to his body. I'll spare you most of the detail, but his face had been ripped off, his right arm was missing, and his chest had been opened, forcefully.\n\nThe owners of the camp employed me for the remainder of his contract under his name, but around a week after the worst had blown over, I was walking alone in an isolated part of the campground. I wasn't far from where the jawbone had been rcovered, when I noticed I was being followed. Someone I had never seen before was approaching me. The figure walked silently, hiding whenever I turned to look. As I kept getting glimpses of the figure, I saw that they were clad fully in white. I could not see any of their skin, and because the circular mask that they wore had no holes, I did not know if they could see me. \n\nI kept moving, desperately trying to keep my cool, until I saw something glowing up ahead. it was a faint red glow, hidden under something. I forgot about my pursuer, and walked towards the object, almost entranced by the pulsating glow. as I got closer, I saw that the thing, whatever it was, was obscured by a battered uniform shirt. I pulled the shirt aside to find a human heart, glowing red, and still beating, against all logic. I jumped back, about to scream, but a gloved hand pressed itself over my mouth before I could let out a sound. \n\nThe cloaked figure was silent, but efficient, bringing me to the ground before I got the chance to resist. I watched in horror as a gloved hand reached out and grabbed the heart.\n\nMore chilling was the whisper that followed.\n\n\"Eat it or you die.\"\n\nThat is all I remember from that night. The following morning, I woke up in my bed, I wasn't feeling great, but I felt reasonably confident that I could fulfill my duties for the day. The following day was Friday. I felt awful, but I had a strange sense of duty to get up and help. I started feeling feverish around lunchtime, and by dinner, I could hardly taste my food. By closing campfire, I was horribly fatigued and the health officer dismissed me to my quarters. That night, I slid in and out of consciousness. When I slept, I was plagued by nightmarish dreams, and when I awoke, fearful hallucinations shook me to my core. \n\nOn Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better. I showered and ate breakfast, but it was only when I looked in the mirror did I notice something different. The face that stared back at me, I recognized it. It wasn't mine. I was staring at the face of Jimmy Davis. I also had memories, new memories, unfamiliar memories in my head. Memories of a life that wasn't mine.\n\nI was able to fully take his place because of what happened, but I've already lost a lot of what makes me who I was beforehand. I don't know what killed Jimmy Davis, but I'm hunting for information. I can't post this anywhere else, because I don't know who else will listen, and if the authorities find out that I violated the NDA I'm as good as dead.",

        "text": "I was always one to enjoy the solitude of the night. I often took walks late into the evening, finding comfort in the stillness of the night air. However, one cold autumn evening, I had an encounter that would change my perspective on the night forever. That was the night I met the man in the black coat.\n\nI was walking down a narrow alley, the dim light from the streetlamps barely illuminating my path. As I reached the end of the alley, I noticed someone standing there, just beyond the reach of the light. He was wearing a long, black coat that concealed his features, but I could tell that he was watching me. I was curious about this stranger, but as I got closer, I realized that something was off.\n\nI tried to turn and walk away, but my feet wouldn't move. I was frozen, unable to escape the man's gaze. He started to move towards me, his coat rustling with each step, and I knew that I was in danger. I closed my eyes, bracing myself for the worst, but when I opened them again, the man was gone. I looked around the alley, but there was no trace of him, no sign of where he had gone.\n\nI was shaken by what had just happened, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I went home that night and tried to put the encounter out of my mind, but I couldn't forget about the man in the black coat. I never spoke of what had happened that night, but I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still out there, waiting for me.\n\nYears went by, and I thought that I had finally put the man in the black coat behind me. But then, one day, I saw him again. I was walking out of my office building when I spotted him standing across the street, wearing the same black coat. I felt his eyes on me, and I knew that he was following me. I started to run, but no matter where I went, he was always there, watching me, waiting for me.\n\nI was scared for my life and knew that I had to find a way to get rid of him. I tried everything, from changing my routine to seeking help from the authorities, but nothing seemed to work. The man in the black coat was always there, always watching me, always haunting me.\n\nI still don't know who the man in the black coat is, or what he wants from me. All I know is that he's still out there, waiting for me. I can never escape him, no matter how far I run or how hard I try. He will always be there, watching me, haunting me, until the end of my days.\n\nI often think about that autumn night, the night I first encountered the man in the black coat. I think about his black coat and the way it rustled with each step he took. I think about the feeling of being watched, of not being able to escape, and I shiver. I know that I'll never be able to forget about the man in the black coat, and I fear that I'll never be free from him. He will always be there, a constant reminder of the fear and terror that I felt on that autumn night.\n\nIn conclusion, the encounter with the man in the black coat was a turning point in my life. It changed the way I viewed the night and left a lasting impression on me. I may never know who the man in the black coat is or what he wants from me, but I know that he will always be a part of me, a constant reminder of fear and terror.",

I think it was May something. I mean it's not like it didn't exist before then or anything. It had always been here, nestled comfortably in the deforested stretch of land beside us-- long before Ethel Commons was even built, it would seem.

I NEED to hire whoever does it!\"* The post read.\n\n*\"What's Willowcrest?\"* Mr. Collins, the gruff man with the two Pitbull on Mayfield Boulevard, wrote beneath.\n\n*\"The cemetery.\"* She replied, her contempt for Mr. Collins' barking dogs almost visually noticeable.\n\n*\"We have a cemetery?\"* Ambrose Rose, the weird middle-aged neighbor, asked.\n\n*\"The one behind our neighborhood.\"* Susanne commented, continuing the reply chain. *\"Am I the only one who lives here??\"*\n\nAnd so it was. \n\nThe collective eyes of Ethel Commons were opened that day to Willowcrest, the cemetery nestled right between our neighborhood and Westin High, in the forest. The entire neighborhood quickly caught on, and it wasn't long before the place was uncovered.\n\nOne neighbor, I think it was Michael Haley (the softball coach for St. Andrews'), found a convenient path leading from the south side of the neighborhood to the back entrance of the cemetery, through a winding breadth of oak trees and rosebushes. \n\nAfter which, people started going down to Willowcrest on the regular. It became a popular destination for jogs and dog walks for those in Ethel Commons, especially for the people who hated the limited lawn space the designers of the neighborhood carelessly left them with.\n\nObviously I was a regular, too. In fact, along with a couple of my neighborhood friends, I was one of the first people to ever explore the place. As a active teen boy, the urge for adventure was always calling me, and the newly uncovered territory of Willowcrest gave me new material to explore.\n\nDescribing the place wouldn't do it proper justice, but I'll try anyway.\n\nIt's a pretty open space without many trees, which is pretty bizarre given the fact that it's surrounded by thick groves of Oak trees, but it was. It has many nice benches and gazebos to rest in, along with several natural canopies of Willow trees to take shade under. It has long patches of lush, well-trimmed grass covering the entire expanse of the 75 acres of land. It made total sense why Susanne wanted the same lawn service so badly after exploring the place for the first time. Rolling hills topped with white marble gravestones stretched out as far as you could see, until the backdrop of trees cut them off. The whole area smelled like fresh cut grass and roses, and the sun basked the whole place in an ethereal glow of warmth.\n\nHonestly, Willowcrest was so breathtaking it made me wonder how nobody had ever really noticed it before until Susanne mentioned it. I chalked it up to the secluded nature of the place.\n\nThe first day I went, my friends and I ran through the across the whole place together, laughing and yelling the whole way. We dove past graves and pots of flowers as we chased each other under the warm Spring sun, enjoying the feel of soft grass beneath our bare feet. We spent the whole afternoon chasing each other through rows of Willow trees. We came home panting and sticky with sweat, but thoroughly excited for the next time we could do it again.\n\nThat day was the highlight of my week, and we quickly made it a usual after-school activity. \n\nSome moms in the neighborhood had qualms about the place, after kids like us started going daily. But unlike anywhere else moms would usually complain about, there was nothing for them to go off of. Nobody sketchy ever hung out there, no drug deals ever took place in a gazebo or anything. In fact, nobody really hung out there at all, besides people from Ethel Commons. \n\nThe entire time I knew about the cemetery, I don't think I ever saw *one* person I didn't know there. Not even visitors coming to grieve, which in retrospect was odd. But it felt like our neighborhood's own private little park, and there was nothing that could prevent me and the other kids from making use of it. \n\nLuckily, my mom wasn't a helicopter parent like some people I knew, and always let me go. She told me to always come back before dark, and leave immediately if anything strange ever happened there, to which I readily agreed to without a second thought.\n\nBut I have to admit. I would be lying if I said there wasn't anything strange about Willowcrest. Nothing strange enough to tell my mom, of course. It wasn't like it was dangerous stuff or anything, but the oddities of the place seemed to mount each time I visited. \n\nFor one, none of the graves in the cemetery had dates on them. Now, this might seem like kind of a stupid concern, because a lot of families choose not to put dates on their loved one's graves. But I mean like NONE of them had dates.\n\nYou could walk the entire length of the cemetery and you wouldn't be able to find a single date; birth or death. Just names, really. And the names themselves were kind of odd, too. Not because they were strange names, but because they *weren't*.\n\nNames like: Michael Scott,  John Andrews, Phillip Harvey, James Johnson, William Robert...\n\nYou get the point.\n\nAll were strangely normal, like someone had looked up *'top 25 most common names'* and pasted them on the graves. There were even a few repeats, if you went deep enough into Willowcrest. I swear I've seen at least three different *James Walkers* before, maybe more.\n\nNot to mention all of he graves were always completely clean. Like, would make Gordon Ramsey cry tears of joy type of clean. So pristinely white and unblemished that you could see your own reflection on half of them. All of them were so perfectly cut, engraved and cleaned that you'd think there'd be a whole legion of cleaners with scrub and spray in hand, washing the stones 'round the clock. But there weren't. \n\nIn fact, I had never seen any maintenance workers out. Ever. \n\nI had never seen anyone cut the grass, anyone trim the trees, rake the leaves, or even put the seemingly always-fresh-flowers in the pots in front of the graves. And I had been to Willowcrest every time of the day, even night sometimes when I wasn't suppose to, on the rare occasions I was dared to lick a grave or something. And in all those times, morning, evening, afternoon or night, it was always vacant. If it wasn't so well kept, I would have assumed it was abandoned.\n\nBut I never really thought much of all this stuff. I mean, why would I? I was just a teen boy with too much time on his hands, making use of the newfound space beside his neighborhood with his friends.\n\nBut all of this really came on its head on one cold night in November.\n\nI was having a sleepover at my friend Andrew's house with a couple other guys. We were chilling around, talking about girls, eating pizza and playing some Mario cart on the Switch, usual Friday stuff. It was well after midnight when one of the guys, David, called for a game of truth or dare.\n\n\"Who's up for a dare?\" David called from behind the couch, turning off the console as he spoke.\n\nA murmur of collective agreement could be heard around the room in response, minus the annoyed shouting of Isaac, who had been playing the Switch. We all quickly gathered around the foldable table, in a circle, and began the game.\n\nI was up first.\n\n\"Truth or dare?\" David asked me.\n\n\"Dare.\" I replied. I was no pussy.\n\n\"I dare you...\" There was a mischievous gleam in his eyes that made me instantly regret playing with him. David was known for his particularly harsh challenges, especially after he challenged Charlie to pull down an old lady's pants last month. \n\nI really had no clue what to expect from him, but I knew it wouldn't be good.\n\n\"...To dig up a grave in Willowcrest.\"\n\nThere was a collective gasp around the table. Dares were usually harsh at guy's night, but this was a step too far. Way too far.\n\n\"What the actual hell?\" Nathan quietly shouted. \"That's not even a dare. That's straight up illegal.\"\n\nSeveral heads nodded in agreement with him.\n\n\"So what?\" David challenged. \"Are *any* of our dares legal?\"\n\nNathan didn't have a reply to that, so he shut up.\n\nAs I seat on my foldable chair thinking about the dare, I felt my blood run cold. The thought of digging up a coffin in the now pitch-black cemetery was beyond disturbing. I had done dares involving going out there after dark before, but still, nothing like this.\n\n\"David. I- I can't do that.\" I stammered. \"That's messed up.\"\n\nLow murmurs of agreement reverberated around the room.\n\n\"Oh, come on!\" David's arms flailed out in an exasperated plea. \"Am I friends with a bunch of losers?\"\n\nNobody responded.\n\n\"Just find a really old grave, one no one really cares about more. Then just dig it up, put it back, and call it a day. Not so hard, huh?\" he continued. \"Hell, I'll even help him if it means Marcus doesn't soil his pants while doing it.\"\n\nSilence filled the still room as David ended his plea.\n\nI regret this decision more then anything, but I accepted the dare. I couldn't chicken out, it wasn't in my blood.\n\n\"I'll do it.\" I said.\n\nI accepted it because I convinced myself it wouldn't hurt anyone, especially if the grave was old. \n\nI would go there with David, find a grave, dig it up, put it back, then get the hell out of there. Anything to not be labeled a wimp. \n\nDavid and I got two shovels out of Andrew's garage, on the promise that we'd return them--clean--immediately afterwards. We then continued to walk across the neighborhood, cutting through various lawns in the process, before reaching dark path that led into Willowcrest.\n\nGoing down to the cemetery after dark was always a surreal experience, but this time the feeling was  exemplified by the act I knew I was about to commit. \n\nThe forest was naturally dark. Without a full moon, the cemetery and surrounding area was nearly pitch black. Luckily David brought a flashlight to guide the way. We twisted through the winding path until it opened up to the main area of the cemetery.\n\nI basked in the sight of it for a moment. Darkness enveloped the rolling hills of gravestones, like a fog spreading over a marsh. The only small sources of light came from the graves, which impressively reflected whatever small light bounced off of them, to the point that they almost glowed.\n\n\"Which one are we going for?\" I asked David, trying to hide the quiver in my voice. I was glad it was dark, otherwise he might have seen me shaking.\n\n\"Westside. Graves are oldest there.\"\n\nI'm pretty sure he was making that up, since all the graves looked exactly the same, and had no dates on them, but I wasn't about to correct him. I just wanted it over with as soon as possible.\n\nWe walked for several minutes before coming across a a medium-sized patch of grass huddled between two large Willow trees, whose branches spiraled high into the night sky like the tendrils of an ancient sea creature.\n\n\"Here's a good spot. It's hidden from easy view.\" David said.\n\n\"Which grave?\" I asked. There were about half a dozen stones lined up between the two trees, all with similarly generic names engraved on them.\n\n\"This one.\" He pointed to the one on the far right with his flashlight.\n\n*John Smith* it read.\n\nSeemed as good of a grave as any, but still I shuddered at the thought of what I was about to do with David. \n\nDavid began rolling up his sleaves.\n\n\"C'mon. We don't have all night.\" He yelled.\n\nAnd so we began. Shovel after shovel full of dirt was aggressively torn from the grass just below the grave, and into the increasing pile to the right of it. I hadn't realized before how hard digging would be. It was long, hard, monotonous work.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes of constant digging, we barely scratched half a foot into the soil.\n\n\"How deep are graves anyway?\" I asked David, sweating away while burying his foot in another shovel-full of dirt.\n\n\"Shut up and keep digging.\" Was all he said in reply.\n\nWe kept at it for what seemed like hours, making very small progress at a time. Every time we got deeper, it became harder to dig. The dirt seemed to keep getting harder, and the hole quickly became so narrow only one of us could dig at a time.\n\nI started getting more nervous the deeper we got. My heart started fluttering the more I thought about the complete illegality of what we were doing.\n\nRight before I was about to call it off, dare or no dare, David hit something.\n\n*Clank.* Came the sound of the shovel hitting something hard.\n\nWe were maybe three feet into the dirt, which I thought was way too shallow for anything to be buried. But my assumption was quickly disproven as David wiped dirt away from the uncovered hard substance, revealing the top of a wooden coffin.\n\n\"Eureka.\" He said.\n\nSeeing the actual coffin made me rethink everything. It suddenly became very real, what we were doing, and it made me incredibly uncomfortable.\n\n\"Holy--\" I began. \"David, listen... I just don't think we should be--\"\n\n\"Marcus.\" He looked up at me from inside the hole. \"I'm gonna do this whether you go home or not. So, are you gonna be a fucking pussy and go home? Or are you gonna help me get this damn thing out?\"\n\nThere was no going back after that. Nerves or no nerves, I was gonna get it done.\n\nWe continued to dig. We didn't need to go deeper anymore, we just need to dig more around the sides to expose it. My arms were so sore at that point, that each shovel of dirt felt like a hundred-pound weight at the end of a stick, but we kept on. There was no chance I was gonna be called a pussy by David. Not this time. I ignored my beating hart, increasingly speeding up the more we uncovered.\n\nAt some point, after the billionth shovel full of dirt, I bean to worry that we'd be out there all night. The dark air seemed to grow thick around me, reminding me that I wasn't suppose to be there. My mom would be looking for me if I wasn't home in the morning. \n\nI knew this had to be fast. I continued to dig.\n\nAfter another half hour or so of digging, the coffin was finally  fully exposed. What stared back at us from beneath our freshly dug hole was abnormally clean. \n\nIt was a fine mahogany coffin, strapped with iron casings that ran the length of its five and half foot lid. It was pristine, like the graves, despite having sat in the dirt for who knows how long. Which was the oddest part about it, and gave me a noticeably uncomfortable feeling.\n\nIt gave me shudders, for some reason. I felt like I should have been anywhere but there. I felt like I was looking at something I shouldn't have been looking at.\n\n\"So?\" David roughly pushed me. \"What are you waiting for?\"\n\n\"What do you mea--\"\n\n*No. He wouldn't. I wasn't gonna open that thing.*\n\n\"You can't be seriously asking me to open it, right?\" I asked nervously. \"That wasn't part of the damn deal.\"\n\nHe took a seat on the outskirts of the hole, his feet dangling mere inches from the lid of the coffin\n\n\"We already did the work,\" he started \"so why not? I've always wanted to know what these things looked like inside.\"\n\nThe way his voice bubbled with curiosity gave me second guesses about the meaning behind this dare.\n\n\"Well I'm not.\" I finally put my foot down, and my shovel. I was officially done with this whole thing. If he wanted to do it, I wouldn't stop him. But I did my part, that's all I needed to know.\n\n\"Okay then, loser.\" He scoffed, as I walked towards the nearby Willow tree and sat below its branches to catch my breath. \"I'll just do it myself.\"\n\nI closed my eyes for a moment as I sat against the tree, soaking in everything that had happened. If my mom ever found out I had been digging a--\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?\"\n\nMy eyes flew open. That couldn't be good.\n\nI quickly got up and ran over to David, who was leaning over the coffin, looking into it with a white face and pale fingers clutching the flashlight.\n\nAs I got closer, I followed his view, and looked into the hole.\n\nAt first, I couldn't tell what it was. It took several moments for my eyes to adjust to the contents of the dark coffin. All I could see was the white outline of something.\n\n\"It's... Plastic\" David stammered behind me. \n\n\"It's fucking plastic.\" He kept repeating over and over like a broken record.\n\nI took the flashlight from his cold hands, shining it on the hole.\n\nWhat stared back at me, I'll never forget. \n\nIt was a skeleton. Not just any skeleton, but a pristine, white as snow skeleton. No blemishes, no dark spots, no decaying tissue or rotten flesh just... A perfectly white skeleton. \n\nLooking at it closer, shining the flashlight across it, the bones had an unmistakable gleam of.... Something. I don't know what it looked like, but it didn't look like human bones, despite the fact that I'd never seen them before. \n\nTaking a chance, I reached down in the hole, leaning my hole body off of it, and reached out my hands to touch the sternum of the skeleton.\n\nIt felt like plastic. Hollow plastic.\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\nAs I hung off the side of the hole, looking down at the skeleton, I felt dread wash over my body. It was plastic, David was right. \n\nI didn't know what to do with that information. I couldn't process it, so I just hung over the hole, staring into it.\n\nAfter several moments, I heard David taking off behind me, probably running home to forget this whole night had ever happened. I felt his feet pounding away as I continued to stare into the dark abyss long after he left. \n\nI did my best to cover up everything. I shoved most of the dirt I could back in, and smoothed it out with my shoes.\n\n I ran back home that night with equal parts confusion, fear and resolve boiling in my chest. I knew never wanted to look in another coffin again, and I knew I could never stomach going to Willowcrest ever again after what I saw.\n\nMy local cemetery is not haunted, but I'm still never going back.\n\nIt's hard to be haunted when there are no souls inside.",

        "text": "I (16m) have lived in my house my whole life. I never really realized we were a wealthy neighborhood, just most of my friend‚Äôs houses had pools, and lots of kids got cars when they turned 16, stuff like that. The neighbors have block parties, we go to church together, very small town America stuff. No one ever did or said anything overtly racist, but pretty much everyone I grew up around was white. Still, they all seemed nice, it seemed like the perfect place to grow up, even for an awkward kid like me. Until this past June. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had finished my exams, so it was summer break for me. My sister Emma (12f) was pissed that she still had two more weeks of school, and I woke up to her slamming the door. Kind of a brat thing to do, but I‚Äôd be mad too if I was her. I lazed around for a while after that, checking my phone, then grabbed breakfast. My parents were at work, but there was a note from my mom to look out for her delivery today. At about 10 a.m. I popped onto Facebook, I‚Äôd been checking Marketplace for new headphones. A post on my news feed caught my eye, from our neighborhood group. Lindsay Marshall, who‚Äôs daughter went to school with Emma, posted a blurry pic of a silver Audi, with the word WARNING underneath. She went on to say how the ‚Äúbrown guy‚Äù driving that car had been parked in front of the school. I guess she confronted him because he didn‚Äôt have any kids with him, and he said something vague and drove off. There were a ton of comments below urging her to go to the police. I rolled my eyes and closed the window. *People around here are so paranoid*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI played video games until about lunch time, when I suddenly remembered I forgot to actually check for headphones, so I opened Facebook again. This time the first thing I saw was a post from the local sheriff‚Äôs department about the silver Audi. It looked like Lindsay called the cops after all. I clicked back to her original post and saw the thread had grown by hundreds of comments. It seemed like everyone in town was talking about this dude and his silver Audi. Then, people started posting about another brown guy in a white van driving around our neighborhood as well. Then someone posted about human trafficking. The grown ups all seemed really scared and concerned, I thought about calling my mom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard a car door *slam* and looked out my window. My room looked out over our quiet cul-de-sac, and I saw a white van idling in my driveway. My heart started beating fast and my mouth went dry as I tried to remember if I‚Äôd locked the door after Emma left this morning. I was halfway down the stairs as I heard another engine roar up and screech to a stop. Voices started outside, they were angry but I couldn‚Äôt make out what they were saying. One of them sounded familiar. I peeked out my front window and saw our next door neighbor, Mr. Baird, he had parked right behind the van and was up in the driver‚Äôs face. The driver was young and dark. He also looked scared, I realized two other men that I knew from the neighborhood were with Mr. Baird. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI‚Äôd have been scared to, because Mr. B is *huge*. He owns his own construction company and looks like he could snap you in two just by thinking about it. I don‚Äôt know what the guy said to Mr. B, but he shoved the guy to the ground, hard. By the time I had run to my front door and opened it, they had the guy flipped over and his hands zip-tied behind him. All four men stopped and stared at me as I opened the front door. The man on the ground tried to yell something, but Mr. B shoved his face into the pavement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúDylan, it‚Äôs okay son, you‚Äôre safe.‚Äù Mr. B spoke calmly and looked me in the eye, like the man below him didn‚Äôt even exist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at the man on the ground and the white van behind him. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening sir?‚Äù I hated the quiver in my voice, but I couldn‚Äôt help it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúThese guys have been canvassing the neighborhood, son. First the school, now our streets. The police have been dealing with human trafficking in the city for some time, now it looks like they‚Äôre trying to come here.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúMr. B? Are you sure? My mom was expecting a package today, maybe that‚Äôs just what-‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúDylan, trust me, we know what we‚Äôre doing son.‚Äù Mr. B‚Äôs voice was harder now, the way grown ups get when they don‚Äôt want you to ask any more. The man started screaming then. Saying how they were crazy old fucks and he was just doing his job. One of the men behind Mr. B came up with a roll of duct tape and put some over the man‚Äôs mouth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. B stood up, but kept his foot placed on the man‚Äôs back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúGo on inside now son, we‚Äôll handle it from here.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúDo.. Do you want me to call the police, sir?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. B‚Äôs eye‚Äôs went hard at that. He motioned to the men behind him, and they picked up the man and put him in the back of the white van in the driveway. Mr. B walked up to me and I suddenly felt unsafe all over again as he put his huge hand on my shoulder and bent down to look me straight in the eye. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúSon, you‚Äôll understand this when you‚Äôre a man and have a home and family to protect. The world is a hard place, and there‚Äôs only so much that the police are able to do. How would you feel if something bad happened to someone in this neighborhood? Hell, he was here, at your house. What if they snatched Emma? How would your Mom feel about that?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to speak but he tightened his meaty hand on my shoulder and I stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúGo on back inside now Dylan, and don‚Äôt go running your mouth off about this either.‚Äù \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned and started to walk back to the house when he called back to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúOh and Dylan?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúYes, sir?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúRemember son, I‚Äôm always right next door.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, he turned and went back to his truck. One of the other men got into the van and backed it out after he drove away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo days later the sheriff came to our house in the evening. He had questions about a delivery driver that had gone missing in the area. As I sat in our living room between my mom and dad, the sheriff asked if I had seen anything strange. I heard Mr. B‚Äôs lawn mower start up outside, and remembered that he and the sheriff were good friends. As I shook my head, my mom assured the sheriff that she hadn‚Äôt received her delivery that day. As the sheriff left I saw him walk over to Mr. B‚Äôs lawn. The two men laughed and chatted for a few minutes, surveying the lush uniform expanse of lawn in front of them. Mr. B was a fanatic about his lawn, stamping out any weed that dared sprout on his precious turf. He turned and our eyes met over his perfectly uniform blades of grass, and I got a sour feeling in my stomach. Not because he looked at me suspiciously, I think I could have handled that. Because he looked at me like we were *friends.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I‚Äôve just done what I do best, turtled up. People moved on from the disappearance of the driver to other things. The way that people are connected around here, it‚Äôs better not to make waves. My parents are always going on about what a great place this is to grow up. I guess it is, if you‚Äôre not weird like me. Emma seems to do just fine. Besides I didn‚Äôt *know* they hurt him or anything. Mr. B has a lot of money, maybe they just paid him to go away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSchool started back up again, fall turned into winter. I like my classes, and I even have a spare first thing in the morning, so I get to sleep in. I try not to think about that day in June too much, when I do, the sour feeling in my stomach comes back. Mr. B offered me a job at his construction company next summer, and my parents think I should take it. I know the pay is great, but whenever I think about it, I think about his hand squeezing my shoulder, and the look in the eyes of the man on the ground. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that isn‚Äôt why I started writing all of this out. I know things would have eventually felt fine again, they were already starting to, slowly. But then this morning, something weird happened. Everyone had left for school or work, and I was getting ready when I heard the doorbell ring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got to the door, no one was there. I looked down and my stomach got that sour feeling again. Sitting on our front step was a box, it looked half charred and was soaking wet. It smelled gross, but I picked it up and brought it inside anyway. For some reason, I didn‚Äôt want anyone to see it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy stomach has been in knots since, I can‚Äôt eat and my hands won‚Äôt stop shaking. I can just barely make out the label on the box, but I can see it‚Äôs addressed to my mom. I know, *I know*, this is the package that she was waiting for that day in June. Since I‚Äôm pretty sure the driver didn‚Äôt deliver it, who did? Why now? And why do I feel like it‚Äôs a threat?\n\n[x.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingsOfEvelynReece/)",
