What could Transhumanism mean from an artistic standpoint? Could we interpret art differently? Become more skilled physically? More easily put our thoughts into a visual?\n\nTo begin, allow me to give an example to spark some discussion:\n\nThe human eye is sensitive to only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, we are aware of the existence of Infrared and Ultraviolet, as well as much more. What if the eye were able to see in a wider variety of wavelengths? What if the brain were able to interpret it? Imagine being the first person to see and interpret Infrared and Ultraviolet... and then using paints with pigments that reflect those wavelengths.",

Alzheimer's comes to mind and there needs to be more research into it.\n\nSo my question is this, can the brain last indefinitely outside of it's body as long as all biological requirements of it are met or is there some other problem that may exist that keeps this from happening? Is it possible that with an artificial life support system, sensor inputs, and outputs to allow interaction with either the information systems of the world or physical electromechanical systems, could the brain last 10,000 years?",

The thing about a monarchy is that you focus all of the attention of an entire population onto one person, and when they rise up, or another nation invades, who do you think they are going after first? \n\nAlexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Louis XVI, Hitler, Mussolini, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, Ceausescu, Slobodan Milosevic, Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein. They were all either ousted, killed, or both. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPublic support shifts. I imagine the shift increases the longer a ruler remains in power. Immortality doesn't mean that a dictator has unlimited power, it just means that they will live long enough to eventually be overthrown.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nedit: Granted, there are dictators from history who died of natural causes while still in power, but that does not mean their reigns would have continued indefinitely. It could just as legitimately be said that they didn't live long enough to be overthrown.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(This argument only works with the [non-ageing](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless) version of immortality. Add to this [indestructability](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability) and maybe they've got a point, except any tech allowing this kind of existence would not remain secret forever.)",

        "text": "(...) \"Communist life will not be formed blindly, like coral islands, but will be built consciously, will be tested by thought, will be directed and corrected. Life will cease to be elemental, and for this reason stagnant. Man, who will learn how to move rivers and mountains, how to build peoples' palaces on the peaks of Mont Blanc and at the bottom of the Atlantic, will not only be able to add his own life richness, brilliancy and intensity, but also a dynamic quality of the highest degree. The shell of life will hardly have tim to form before it will burst open again under the pressure of new technical and cultural inventions and achievements. Life in the future will not be monotonous. \n\nMore than that. Man at last will begin to harmonize himself in earnest. He will make it his business to achieve beauty by giving the movement of his own limbs the utmost precision, purposefulness and economy in his work, his walk and his play. He will try to master first the semi-conscious and then the subconscious processes in his own organism, such as breathing, the circulation of the blood, digestion, reproduction, and, within necessary limits, he will try to subordinate them to the control of reason and will. Even purely physiologic life will become subject to collective experiments. The human species, the coagulated homo sapiens, will once more enter into a state of radical transformation, and, in hiw own hands, will become an object of the most complicated methods of artificial selection and psycho-physical training. This is entirely in accord with evolution. Man first drove the dark elements out of industry and ideology, by displacing barbarian routine by scientific technique, and religion by science. Afterwards he drove the unconscious out of politics, by overthrowing monarchy and class with democracy and rationalist parliamentarianism and then with the clear and open Soviet dictatorship. The blind elements have settled most heavily in economic relations, but man is driving them out from there also, by means of the Socialist organization of economic life. This makes it possible to reconstruct fundamentally the traditional family life. Finally, the nature of man himself is hidden in the deepest and darkest corner of the unconscious, of the elemental, of the sub-soil. Is it not self-evident that the greatest efforts of investigative thought and of creative initiative will be in that direction? The human race will not have ceased to crawl on all fours before God, kinds and capital, in order later to submit humbly before the dark laws of heredity and a blind sexual selection! Emancipated man will want to attain a greater equilibrium in the work of his organs and a more proportional developing and wearing out of his tissues, in order to reduce the fear of death to a rational reaction of the organism towards danger. There can be no doubt that man's extreme anatomical and physiological disharmony, that is, the extreme disproportion in the growth and wearing out of organs and tissues, give the life instinct the form of a pinched, morbid and hysterical fear of death, which darkens reason and which feeds the stupid and humiliating fantasies about life after death. \n\nMan will make it his purpose to master his own feelings, to raise his instincts to the heights of consciousness, to make them transparent, to extend the wires of his will into hidden recesses, and thereby to raise himself to a new plane, to create a higher social biologic type, or, if you please, a superman. \n\nIt is difficult to predict the extent of self-government which the man of the future may reach or the heights to which he may carry his technique. Social construction and psycho-physical self-education will become two aspects of one and the same process. All the arts- literature, drama, painting, music and architecture will lend this process beautiful form. More correctly, the shell in which the cultural construction and self-education of Communist man will be enclosed, will develop all the vital elements of contemporary art to the highest point. Man will become immeasurably stronger, wiser and subtler; his body will become more harmonized, his movements more rhythmic, his voice more musical. The average human type will rise to the heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe, or a Marx. And above this ridge new peaks will rise.\"\n\n(source: Trotsky, Leon. *Literature and Revolution*.

I think taking Prozac for 20 years changes a person's overall nature far more than changing the molecular structure of their lymphocytes.\n\nOf course it's somewhat of a different matter if you're talking about germ line versus somatic gene therapy, but even then I would argue that one's personality has more than 50 percent to do with their environment and epigenetics.\n\nIs it just because psych drugs are far more profitable and there's too much emphasis on DNA being the basis of somebody's identity?

The actual link to it is [here](http://shop.catholic.com/featured/catholic-answers-magazine-by-issue/catholic-answers-magazine-nov-dec-2015-issue.html), but you would have to buy it.\n\nThe article also touches on the singularity too.\n\nAnyway I was talking with my Spanish professor (who is staunchly Catholic), and we sometimes talk about philosophical matters and the like, and I run a college club dedicated to promoting the understanding of futurology and its related subjects, so I have the whole singularity bent to my viewpoint as well.\n\nShe saw this article in the magazine linked above that she gets and immediately thought of me, and wanted to know what I thought about it.  I figured that I would post it here (and to the other transhuman and the singularity subreddits) to try and get some more feedback.\n\nIt might be worth noting that she believes that God has a direct hand in worldly matters and believes that \"it\" won't happen because \"it\" will be stopped, and that there are fine lines to cross or something like that.  I don't think that makes much sense depending on how broad one defines transhumanism, but you know what they say about trying to reason someone out of something they weren't reasoned into...\n\nIn your opinion, does it do a good job at explaining what transhumanism IS?  Though by definition here it has the catholic bias to it, is it still at least a fair assessment?  What do you think?",
