        "text": "**Introduction**\n\nOn 30 November 2022, Youtuber r/SimonClark, made [an excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGtAilkWTtI) on the lengthy history of climate change science. The science is rock solid, but the history less so.\n\nThe video made several claims about Eunice Foote, a nineteenth century scientist who made an important observation related to climate change, and in this section Simon made a few missteps, which I'm correcting here. I'll be covering these topics.\n\n1. Were Foote’s patents in her husband’s name?\n2. Was Foote’s paper a first for women?\n3. Did Foote discover the greenhouse effect?\n\nFor a video version of this post with additional detail, go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WbRP1GFzqw&amp;ab_channel=veritasetcaritas).\n\n**Where Foote's patents in her husband's name?**\n\nClark provides a good general introduction to Foote’s early life, and then says this.\n\n&gt;She invented a paper-making machine a thermostatically controlled cooking stove and less squeaky shoes and she was a scientist. But of course she was those things in a society in which to be a woman was to be excluded. While she was an inventor her inventions were patented in her husband’s name as women couldn’t defend patents in court.\n\nThis isn't true. Foote's squeaky shoe patent was made in her own name, as you can see when you find the patent in the US patent registry; it literally opens with \"Be it known that I, EUNICE. N. FOOTE, of Saratoga Springs, in the county of Saratoga and State of New York, have invented an Improvement in Boots and Shoes\".\\[1\\] \n\nIn fact Foote’s filing of a patent in her own name was not remotely revolutionary. The first woman in the US to apply for and receive a patent in her own name was Mary Kies, all the way back in 1809, who used a law passed in 1790 which was worded to allow “any person or persons” to file a patent application, without reference to gender.\\[2\\]\n\n**Was Foote's paper a first form women?**\n\nAt around 7:08 Simon makes this statement about the most significant scientific contribution Foote ever made, and the entire reason why she features in his video.\n\n&gt;So when she published circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays in the American Journal of Science and Arts in 1856 it was the first ever publication by a female author in any scientific journal other than those dedicated to astronomy.\n\nThis isn't true. Foote’s paper was preceded by at least 30 years by scientist Mary Somerville, a Scot. In 1826, Somerville published a six page paper in the prestigious scientific journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, entitled On the Magnetizing Power of the More Refrangible Solar Rays.\\[3\\] In it she explained she was testing a hypothesis about magnetism proposed by a professor Mirichini in Rome. This paper was very obviously not about astronomy.\n\nIn 1846 Somerville had an 11 page paper published in the same scientific journal, this one entitled On the Action of the Rays of the Spectrum on Vegetable Juices.\\[4\\] Again, it described in detail her scientific hypothesis and experimental methodology. Again, certainly not about astronomy.\n\n**Did Foote discover the greenhouse effect?**\n\nAt around 7:21 Simon makes this statement about Foote’s experiment.\n\n&gt;In her paper she detailed experiments she conducted with different gasses trapped inside glass cylinders and heated by the sun she noted that when she filled a cylinder with carbonic acid gas carbon dioxide. It was heated to a higher temperature by sunlight and crucially retained its heat much longer than those cylinders filled with other gases. She correctly identified Fourier’s heat trapping property of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide didn’t obscure sunlight, but it absorbed thermal radiation and by being present in the atmosphere even in very modest quantities this increased the average temperature of the Earth.\n\nThis is partially true. Simon’s description of Foote’s experiments is accurate, but his description of her conclusions is incorrect. It’s true that carbon dioxide absorbs thermal radiation, that is, infrared radiation, but there’s no evidence Foote knew this herself. That might seem confusing, since she came to the correct conclusion that carbon dioxide could act as an insulating agent trapping heat, but the fact is her experiment was not measuring thermal radiation, and her equipment actually couldn’t; it wasn’t even designed to. \n\nInstead Foote appears to attribute the heating effect to solar light radiation, making explicit reference to the visible light of the sun, writing \" My investigations have had for their object to determine the different circumstances that affect the thermal action of the rays of light that proceed from the sun\".\\[5\\]\n\nIt’s puzzling that Foote attributed the heating effect she detected to the visible light from the sun, because at the time she was conducting her experiment it was already known that visible light from the sun was not the primary mechanism responsible for the earth’s warming, but rather the sun’s invisible infrared light.\n\nIn his foundational work on the physics of global temperature back in the 1820s, Joseph Fourier had explained the theory of how the earth’s temperature could be raised by the atmosphere trapping thermal radiation from the sun, citing an experiment by meteorologist and mountaineer Horace Bénédicte de Saussure.\\[6\\]\n\nFourier described how de Saussure’s experiment demonstrated how the atmospheric temperature, heated by absorbing infrared radiation from the sun, in turn heated the surface of the earth. The experiment used a box with glass walls. Note that this is actually referred to as a hotbox, not strictly a greenhouse, but this is the source of the greenhouse metaphor, which was actually attributed by Fourier in a comment made by Arvid Högbom at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nIn his comments on de Saussure’s work, Fourier writes explicitly “the heat of the sun, has properties different from those of heat without light”, differentiating between visible light and invisible thermal radiation. This is a distinction Foote did not make. Fourier then explained that once the sun’s rays entered the hotbox, “Their heat thus communicated ceases to be luminous, and preserves only the properties of non-luminous radiating heat. In this state it cannot pass through the plates of glass covering the vessel”.\\[7\\] This was an explicit description of how the sun’s thermal radiation is trapped by the earth’s atmosphere.\n\nAt around 8:45 Simon says this.\n\n&gt;Foote’s work was mostly lost in a fire at the Smithsonian Institute in 1865. So she was forgotten for most of subsequent history her results were only rediscovered in 2011. So while you may have heard of Tyndall, Foote was actually the first person, despite many obstacles, to discover that CO2 kept the Earth warmer than it otherwise would be.\n\nFirstly, there’s at least some evidence that Foote was not the first person to discover that carbon dioxide kept the earth warmer than it otherwise would be. In fact the relationship of carbon dixode to the earth’s temperature was already a topic of active discussion in her time, which very likely prompted her research. That's covered in [the video version of this post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WbRP1GFzqw&amp;ab_channel=veritasetcaritas).\n\nSecondly, the reason why people remember Tyndall rather than Foote, is that Foote’s experiment did not help scientists understand the physics of climate change. Her experiment was only capable of measuring sunlight, not the longwave infrared which actually causes global warming. Consequently, Ortiz and Jackson write that her experiment “did not measure the natural greenhouse effect of the Earth’s atmosphere by specifically using longwave IR”. Nor does it seem Foote even understood that it was infrared which causes global warming.\\[8\\]\n\nLikewise, planetary scientist Ralph Lorenz notes that Foote’s work “is not a discovery of the greenhouse effect - if anything it is the opposite (i.e. an antigreenhouse effect, the absorption of sunlight rather than thermal infrared)”.\\[9\\]\n\nClimate scientist Katherine Hayoe observes “her rudimentary experimental design of simply putting jars out in the sun did not actually allow her to isolate the effects of the infrared (heat) radiation given off by the earth from the higher-wavelength energy given off by the sun”. Consequently, Hayoe comments, “her conclusion, that carbon dioxide traps more heat than the other gases she measured, is more serendipitous than evidential”.\\[10\\] In other words, it was a lucky inference rather than a conclusion indicated by her experimental results.\n\nBiochemist Roland Jackson concurs, writing “Foote did not give any clear explanation of the greenhouse effect”, observing “She may have unwittingly detected it”, but that “as she made no comment on those results we can only surmise that she didn’t recognise what might be the cause”.\\[11\\] In contrast, Jackson points out Tyndall deliberately measured the long-wave infrared radiation which he knew was responsible for warming the earth, and which he knew was trapped by the atmosphere. Additionally, Jackson observes Tyndall also “explained the greenhouse effect in terms of the absorption and radiation of heat by gases including carbon dioxide and water vapour in the atmosphere”.\n\nOrtiz and Jackson likewise explain “Foote did not explicitly theorize or investigate what we now call the greenhouse effect”, and add that her experimental data “do not provide a direct measure of the full, natural greenhouse effect”.\\[12\\] However, they still acknowledge Foote did show carbon dioxide has an insulating property which can increase the earth’s atmospheric temperature.\n\nNevertheless, they also observe that despite reaching the correct conclusion that water vapor could increase atmospheric temperature, “her mechanistic understanding as to why was incorrect”.\\[13\\]\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\[1\\] \"Be it known that I, EUNICE.

But on this day, 207 years ago, a woman named Mary Kies used both brains and bonnet to become the United States’ first woman to receive a patent. …She took advantage of a relatively new law, the 1790 Patent Act, which allowed “any person or persons” to petition for protection of their original methods and designs, and was granted the first patent ever awarded to a woman on May 15, 1809.\", Erin Blakemore, “Meet Mary Kies, America’s First Woman to Become a Patent Holder,” *Smithsonian Magazine*, 5 May 2016.\n\n\\[3\\] M.

However there was **always** that bad feeling about Kmart that you couldn’t quite **shake** off. [“Today i’m going to rant about kmart, okay so every time I'm going to kmart it’s always hot in there, the carts are old, the bathrooms are ugly, its  just disgusting”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzA4EKO1ByA&amp;ab_channel=COKACOLAGIRL59) So, where **exactly** did Kmart go wrong? What **made** Kmart fall so far behind and so **quickly** that in a matter of years they **filed** for multiple bankruptcies. [“Not even walmart, walmart is glourious, kmart however is not”](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx7qB-Au3tU_XPli0JZDOZwYwPYGY00qD_).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How was the Kmart branding an important factor that led to underperforming stores?**\n\nThe blue special was a scam. The true purpose of the the blue light special was that it was a way for managers to sell old stock that they wanted to get rid of to make shelf space for new stock. They offered discount products through variety stores and customers wanted it. A lot of us can remember getting our favourite toys from Kmart like Pokemon cards, sky dancers and dolls. Bob Anderson a district manager at Kmart used this opportunity to create the Blue Light Special. “Ladies and genetlemen direct your attention to the blue light” \\[[Blue light special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGanHnDxJlg&amp;ab_channel=CharlesLemmons)\\] It was a short term sales tactic rolled out in 1960s to tell Kmart customers a new product is being offered cheaply in store. However, many feature films like Beatlejuice would make unfavourable remarks toward the Kmart blue light special. [“attention kmart shoppers”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7pF7WNJp3Y&amp;ab_channel=JCH007).\n\nKmart had one great thing going for it and it was their own brand of toys. They made and Source toys that the audience liked. This doll with Down Syndrome was received with praise because it represents an underrepresented demographic.\n\n“Great they’re being representative but do the toys of Down’s syndrome have to have a bowl haircut? They have Downs, not a bad hairdresser.”\n\n“Now I'm not sure, but I can't recall seeing many dolls and thinking \"now that's a good haircut”\n\n“Boy dolls always get bad haircuts.”\n\nPerhaps if they stuck to this strategy at Kmart America they may have built a better reputation and positioned themselves well within the american retail market.\n\n“Kmart still exists?”\n\n“Australian Kmart is unrelated to American Kmart”\n\nSo Americans became disconnected from the Kmart's brand and have assumed that Kmart has fallen off and was a relic of the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany attempts were made by Kmart to establish their brand as a luxury discount retail store.  In 2001 Kmart and Martha Stewart announced a new long-term merchandising agreement. On Letterman, Martha Stewart was quoted as saying that she “Really loves kmart” and that [“I want to get really beautiful things into the store”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itn6wefFOgQ&amp;ab_channel=Letterman). However Ketterman replied with “Then what are you doing at Kmart”. Kmart even went further in efforts to establish itself. It signed a partnership with Disney® children's and JOE BOXER® apparel. [“Boxer shorts. Boxer shorts at kmart”](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx8afx088hmptPH9FvQzraqiT__BYRSZTj). These were exclusive and could only be found at Kmart stores. However, shoppers would find that the in demand items would often be out of stock at a lot of the locations. So Kmart was forced to display low demand items on its shelfs (reference to chairs on displays). Essentially Kmart found itself in a hole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How did Location, Assortment, Pricing, and Service create an impossible economic environment for Kmart?**\n\nKmart made really bad choices in where they opened stores. The right location increases the chances of a business succeeding. However, Kmart put too much emphasis on gimmicks that were at best funny. In an odd display of company culture, this grand opening shows Kmart employees chanting Acme Kmart.\n\n“[acme kmart](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxiDtWqyx8KUgMxEvC2Oh3_Pd-bQz1T45y), acme kmart, acme kmart, acme kmart”\n\nPerhaps if they had put less effort into novel strategies they would have noticed thier obvious own flaw. However, Walmart noticed the flaw and knew that their biggest advantage was location. While Kmart focused solely on the suburbs and refused to get off the well-worn path. Walmart focused on rural areas. [**\\[6455 US-31, Williamsburg, MI 49690\\]**](https://archive.org/details/KmartAcmeMichiganGrandOpening1989) The Kmart - Acme, Michigan store was miles away from the city whereas Walmart was closer. So Walmart tended to get more customers. Walmart intelligently opened stores near urban areas all over america. And although Walmart was a smaller competitor by at the end of 1990 Walmart surpassed Kmart in sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Walmart Affect was their super power and it overwhelmed Kmart. Walmart created well organised supply chains and gathered rural customers quickly with its 'low prices for everything'.\n\n[\\[Montage of pickles from Walmart.\\]](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/readouts/the-wal-mart-effect-how-the-worlds-most-powerful-company-really-works-and-howits-transforming-the-american-economy-2/)\n\nWalmart is known for the gallon sized jar of pickles for $2.97 that would last a year. They were essentially saying\n\n“You can buy this stinkin gallon of pickles for $2.97 and its the nations number one brand”.\n\nWalmart was able to outcompete Kmart in pricing because they has a solid supply chain strategy. Walmart were sourcing 40 percent of their inventory from china and made sure distribution methods to their stores were super efficient. Walmart used basic distribution cost-saving practices such as hub-and-spoke distribution and cross-docking which meant that they could offer the same quality at a cheaper price than Kmart.\n\n[**\\[Wallmart price advertisement\\]**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp-W7ISkcm4&amp;ab_channel=TapeHole)\n\nHowever, Kmart ignored a supply chain strategy and was more focused on acquiring companies and investing in advertisement. So, Kmart were unable to compete on price. And this oversight contributed to a decade long decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2022 this man had a melt down at Walmart for no reasonable reason.\n\n[\\[**Man has meltdown over non english speaker in Walmart**\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/zdrq9y/man_has_meltdown_over_non_english_speaker_in/)\n\nTarget recognised this gap in the retail market and they wanted to give the shopper a far greater shopping experience. Target positioned themselves differently from Walmart and Kmart. Target made sure that the customer shopping experience was good with well priced goods.\n\n”I went to Target with my granddaughter to do some school clothes shopping and she found a shirt she wanted and at checkout our cashier reminded me of a 30% discount on the Target app and went out of her way to help me obtain the discount on my phone when I couldn't get it to come up. She was very helpful and pleasant and just what I needed to end my otherwise hectic day!!” - Google reviews\n\nTheir stores were bright, well stocked and had a splash of style. Target offered an upgraded shopping experience and is the main competitor to Walmart. Kmart couldn’t compete in this retail environment because it didn’t define its unique selling point to its audience. It focused more on crazy advertisement campaigns like the ship my pants advert \\[[ship my pants for free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xwUuSM06xQ&amp;ab_channel=FunnyCommercialsUSA)\\]. Which doesn’t really show anything about what it had to offer to its customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalmart and Target attracted the best talent. **\\[Pan list of youtube videos of how to get a job there\\]** It was the place to work and they attracted talent away from Kmart. Walmart placed emphasis on the best and brightest. Those who worked the hardest succeeded as Walmart grew.\n\n“Thanks to [Wal-Mart's stock purchase plan](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/13866), the wealth of these employees was directly tied to the market value of the company's stock, creating a direct link between growth and its effect on stock price and company morale.”\n\nAs of 2022, a Walmart manager earns on average $210,000 a year. And in 2021 Walmart created a program that fast tracks graduates into managerial roles. Top performers earn a starting wage of at least $65,000 per year. The battle for the best among retailers has meant that…\n\n[“Walmart is going after highschool students in war for talent”](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/03/walmart-is-going-after-high-school-students-in-war-for-talent.html)\n\nSo, Walmart has always placed emphasis on the getting the best employees and is one of the big factors that sets it apart from Kmart.\n\nKmart failed to compete in the key areas that would have  ensured it stayed competitive. Other competitors focused on location, assortment, pricing and service which created an impossible environment for Kmart. Kmart needed to adapt in order to compete and if it didn’t. It would lead to its demise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How was Charles Conaway the final nail in the coffin for Kmart?**\n\nBy 2002, Kmart was in a desparate situation. Although it created numerous new brand deals to save its brand image and business, it was simultaneously fighting off lawsuits. Target was suing Kmart at the time because of their advertising campaign. The Ad \"Dare to Compare\" inaccurately compared its own prices with those of Target a majority of the time on in-store signs. This is damaging to Target and it showed how desparate Kmart was to turn their business around.\n\nBut the next lawsuit really highlighted the problems at Kmart. The Japanese games company, Sega sued Kmart for failure to pay for its Dreamcast systems. Kmart owed $2.2M on a $26M order. [Charles](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-feb-23-fi-29160-story.html) a SF spokesman for sega said\n\n“This ongoing, malicious lack of payment by Kmart does not produce a working environment for companies to trade with one another…”\n\nSo, Sega halted shipments in July 2001 because Kmart had issues with their debts. What this means is that the cashflow at Kmart wasn’t good. They weren’t paying their suppliers because that had no money. The profit, if any, that they made wasn’t covering their liabilities.\n\nHowever, Charles Conaway would be the final nail in the coffin for Kmart. He was the CEO hired in 2000 to turn Kmart around. He saw that Kmart wasn’t doing too well and where the company was heading. Conway used this as an opportunity for himself. He misled investors into investing with Kmart by lying about its financial crisis. Then he borrowed money from the company to fund luxury holidays, planes and boats. Eventually he was caught because Kmart default on its debts. Kmart the once greatest retail store failed and with no where to turn filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.",

        "text": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm0H9oblK8E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm0H9oblK8E)\n\nHe starts of with saying that people believe in propaganda because most people are incapable of thinking and that it's not because they're dumb, but because they have been 'trained' not to think. He thinks that people from an early age have been taught to be emotional which in turn makes them follow an authoritative figure which subsequently makes them repeat what they have been told. \n\nHe then goes on to say that what happened during WW2 were committed by the \"unthinking but self-righteous mob\". \n\nI don't know whether to take him seriously or not, but he thinks that WW2 should best be described as \"Zombie Apocalypse\" because there were \"zombies in every nation, and it was the zombies - the people themselves - that suffered the most\". \n\nTIK really is as thick as mince. He thinks that \"the sheeple of today would disingenuously\" Friedrich Kellner a \"conspiracy theorist\" or a \"flat earther\" for questioning the \"official narrative\" of Nazi propaganda about the events that were happening during WW2. He then bizarrely goes on to quote Victor Kelmperer's diary about him noting that Adolf Hitler's success at the Munich Agreement which enabled the Nazis to annex the Sudetenland part of Czechoslovakia as a success for Nazi propaganda. TIK really doesn't have a clue what a conspiracy theory is and that's why he spouts conspiracy theories himself because he's as dumb as rocks. After quoting Klemperer in which Kemperer used the 'N' word, TIK shows a photo of CEO of Youtuber Susan Wojcicki with the caption, \"Ja, he zaid a naughty vord, zend him to ze camps!\" \n\nHe then leads us into his world of thinking and why he endorses conspiracy theories and other nonsense about the Nazis, especially to do with economics. By stating that cenroship is bad, he says, \"How can you know that your narrative is right if you can't even consider what the alternative narrative is saying? But the vast majority of the population cannot even question the official narrative, let alone listen to alternative opinions. They get emotionally invested in the propaganda, shutting down their cognitive thinking.\" \n\nGive us a break TIK, your gaslight attempts are weak and pathetic. We all have listened to you and your wackadoodle claims, and we have found your claims to be totally false and your pathetic to rewrite history. To this day TIK is still claiming the Nazis were socialists, even though his 'alternative' thoughts have been thoroughly debunked.\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/05/right-needs-stop-falsely-claiming-that-nazis-were-socialists/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/05/right-needs-stop-falsely-claiming-that-nazis-were-socialists/)\n\nTIK then quotes one of his followers who talks about ethnic states. TIK then says 'ethnic states are bad', but then he says we are told that diversity is 'our strength' and that in history we have seen that ethnic states don't work and he lists the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and other places. \n\nTIK then alludes to the white genocide conspiracy theory by asking, \"So why are the politicians, the corporations, and the communists all pushing so hard for multi-ethnic States in the West? Is it because these racists want to destroy the West?\" \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\\_genocide\\_conspiracy\\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_genocide_conspiracy_theory)\n\nHe then tries to goad his viewers by saying that multiethnic and ethnic states are bad, but before he tells you the solution, he wants to hear what his viewers think. He then mentions his own views which he seems to be doing an awful lot in his videos and concludes that his answer is pretty simple and that, \"The problem isn't whether a state is mono or multi-ethnic. The problem is the State itself. It's the state monopoly on violence that's the issue. But when I say that, I evoke an emotional reaction in people, because again, people haven't done their homework, and they just believe the pro-state propaganda.\"\n\nTIK then says about historians that they don't understand and haven't questioned the \"Marxist narrative\" and that's why they have concluded Nazism was reactionary and not revolutionary. \n\nTIK is a liar. Lots of historians have questioned that aspect of Nazism. For example, read David Welch's \"Hitler: Profile of a Dictator\" and Martyn Housden's \"Hitler: Study of a Revolutionary?\". \n\nTIK truly has gone down the rabbit hole. Later on the in the video when talking about the invasion of Poland, he cites David Hoggan, a neo-Nazi historian (like David Irving) who claimed this and that. \n\nTIK then claims only 30 million people died during WW2. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\\_War\\_II\\_casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties)\n\nIt's estimated between 40-50 million people died during WW2.\n\nWhen is this stupidity going to end? It's video after video of conspiracy theories and other balderdash and he just can't help himself spouting his own political views in his videos. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/ze8gvc/a_badhistory_review_to_the_shock_of_all_and/",
        "text": "Hello, those of r/badhistory! Today I am looking at a new Youtube channel called *Knowledgia*. The video itself is called “How did Achaemenid Persia expand?”:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWr78YV6SIs\n\nMy many sources are arrayed and ready, so let us start!\n\n0.47: The narrator says that Achaemenes and Teispes established the kingdom of Anshan. They were certainly recorded as *rulers* of Anshan, but the available evidence suggests they did not found the kingdom. There is nothing in the various Achaemenid inscriptions which explain who founded it. The Cyrus Cylinder only describes the Achaemenid dynasty as being kings of that state. Herodotus does not mention Anshan at all. More importantly, one of the inscriptions produced by Darius the Great says the following:  \n\n'I am Darius the Great King, King of Kings, King in Persia, King of countries, son of Hystaspes, grandson of Arsames, an Achaemenian.\n\nDarius the King says: My father was Hystaspes; Hystaspes' father was Arsames; Arsames' father was Ariaramnes; Ariaramnes' father was Teispes; Teispes' father was Achaemenes.\n\nDarius the King says: For this reason we are called Achaemenians. From long ago we have been noble. From long ago our family had been kings.\n\nDarius the King says: there were 8 of our family who were kings before me; I am the ninth; 9 in succession we have been kings.'\n\nHystaspes himself was not a king, but was described by Herodotus as being a governor. The reference to the eight of his family who were kings before him must have been rulers of the Empire, and Anshan prior to that. From Achaemenes there was Teispes, and then Cyrus I. After this came Cambyses I, Cyrus II, Cambyses II, a civil war after the usurpation of Bardiya?Smerdis, and then Darius. That is only 6 before Darius, and so there are two more kings who reigned previously. If that is true, then that in turn means there must have been other rulers of Anshan prior to Achaemenes, which implies there was already a preexisting state.\n\n2.05: The narrator says no one knows the exact reasoning behind what Cyrus chose to do during the rebellion against Astyages, the ruler of the Medes. While this is correct in that there is always an element of uncertainty when it comes to primary sources and their accuracy and reliability, my issue here is that *Knowledgia* uses that uncertainty to avoid giving the audience the full picture of what the available sources say , and to inform them of the prevailing theories.  \n\nHerodotus says that Astyages had a dream that his grandchild (Cyrus) would overthrow him, and so summoned an ally named Harpagos, and ordered him to kill the newly-born child. Harpagos in turn asked a herdsman to leave Cyrus in a desolate location to perish, but the herdsman exchanged Cyrus with anther baby that was stillborn, and raised Cyrus as his own. Astyages later found about this bamboozling, became very angry at Harpagos, and executed his son. The son was then fed to the father at a banquet. Astyages then reconciled with Cyrus (bet none of you expected that!). Afterwards, Harpagos plotted with other Median leaders to overthow Astyages, and sent the following letter to Cyrus:\n\n‘\"Son of Cambyses, over thee the gods keep guard, for otherwise thou wouldst never have come to so much good fortune. Do thou therefore take vengeance on Astyages who is thy murderer, for so far as his will is concerned thou art dead, but by the care of the gods and of me thou art still alive; and this I think thou hast long ago learnt from first to last, both how it happened about thyself, and also what things I have suffered from Astyages, because I did not slay thee but gave thee to the herdsman. If therefore thou wilt be guided by me, thou shalt be ruler of all that land over which now Astyages is ruler. Persuade the Persians to revolt, and march any army against the Medes: and whether I shall be appointed leader of the army against thee, or any other of the Medes who are in repute, thou hast what thou desirest; for these will be the first to attempt to destroy Astyages, revolting from him and coming over to thy party. Consider then that here at least all is ready, and therefore do this and do it with speed.\" ‘\n\nAccording to this, the motivation of Cyrus appeared to be a mix of a desire to repay Harpagos for protecting him, and a wish to become ruler of both the Medes and the Persians. Reading between the lines, one could speculate that Cyrus may have revolted because Astyages might have come to view him as a threat and have him liquidated at a later point in time. Now, is any of this true? The story, by itself, has enough outlandish elements to make one skeptical, and it does not appear in any Achaemenid inscriptions. At the same time, Herodotus’ account of the usurpation of Smerdia is corroborated by the same inscriptions of Darius mentioned earlier, and Herodotus’ descriptions of Persian military equipment is confirmed by looking at Persian seals and the reliefs at Persepolis. This communicates a certain level of reliability, and so I think it one could argue that such intrigues did take place, at least on some level.  \n\n2.55: The narrator says, after becoming ruler of the combined Persian/Median state, Cyrus went on to subdue the Parthians and Bactrians. This conflicts with Herodotus, who states that Cyrus went on to campaign against the Lydians.  \n\n3.11: The narrator states the empire was made up of semi-autonomous provinces. This is not very accurate. Achaemenid administration could be very flexible, but as far as we can tell most of the provinces (called satrapies) were under direct royal control, as they were governed by satraps appointed by the monarch. There could be independent local forms of organization *within* the satrapy, as Herodotus records aPersian commander named Mardonius establishing democracies amongst the Ionian cities, but there was also much royal oversight.\n\n4.31: The narrator says that, through a combination of a powerful counter-offensive and poor tactical calculation by Croesus, the Achaemenids pushed back against the invaders. This does not appear to be the case at all. According to Herodotus, there was an initial engagement that lasted all day, with heavy casualties on both sides. This first battle ended at nightfall. The next day, Cyrus did not launch a powerful counter-offensive, but rather held back. By comparison, Croesus was concerned that his army was smaller than that of the Persians, and so decided to withdraw. If this is indeed what occurred, withdrawing was actually a *smart* tactical decision by Croesus, as fighting against an army larger than yours is generally a bad idea. For example, Byzantine military manuals advised against battle when outnumbered.  \n\n5.:49: The narrator says, during the conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Cyrus was welcomed by the inhabitants of Babylon. If by ‘welcomed’ they mean ‘resisted and had to be taken by siege’, he is absolutely right. Herodotus states Cyrus encountered much resistance, and eventually had to conquer the city when the Babylonians were distracted by a festival.  \n\n7.23: The sequence of events now jumps straight to the usurper Bardiya (Smerdis) without even covering the supposed assassination of Cambyses, and Bardiya/Smerdis assuming his identity. If this were a movie, the writing would almost be as bad as introducing a new superhero, contriving a close relationship between that superhero and a preexisting character, and then having the superhero’s military call-sign become the name of a future team of super-powered individuals.\n\n8.05: The narrator states Darius would ultimately bring 40% of the world’s population under Persian rule. They are presenting this information as if it were fact, rather than than an extremely speculative estimation. We do not even have close to *any* accurate records about the comparative number of people the Achaemenids governed, yet *Knowledgia* is having the audience think it is objective truth.\n\nAll up, this video was quite flawed. They mixed up the order of events, excluded important information, and left the audience with knowledge that was incorrect,\n\nSources\n\nThe Anabasis, by Xenphon: [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1170/1170-h/1170-h.htm](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1170/1170-h/1170-h.htm)\n\nThe History of Herodotus, Volume One: [https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2707/pg2707-images.html](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2707/pg2707-images.html)\n\nThe History of Herodotus, Volume Two: [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2456/2456-h/2456-h.htm](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2456/2456-h/2456-h.htm)\n\nThree Byzantine Military Treatises, translated by George T.

        "text": "**The Movie Rental War**\n\nEssay Question: How did the economic, social and political landscape change during the battle of Blockbuster &amp; Hollywood Video?\n\n[Movie Source Video](https://youtu.be/oKwUqB28CyY) \n\np.s first essay in a while thanks.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAmong the giant VHS companies that fell from grace blockbuster will always be remembered as the company that lost to Netflix. But, according to Forbes Netflix didn’t kill Blockbuster… something else did. Before the Netflix and Blockbuster wars billions of dollars were being poured into these VHS companies to fight the movie, rental, war. The winner would have complete access to a booming market. Employees were poached, strategies were stolen, law suits were filed, and battle lines were drawn. The best CEOs were brought in from mega companies like Walmart to fight this war and only one came out on top.\n\n**Why was Britney Spears at Blockbuster on … an iconic moment in the Movie Rental Wars?**\n\nCompanies like Blockbuster were special because it changed our lives in the 90s. Blockbuster created unforgettable memories for families in the VHS age. Gabriel Whetstine recalled being expelled from his private middle school and being taken by his dad to blockbusters on his way back to get movies and candy. He still remembers the lighting and the sound of employees constantly rewinding the VHS tapes. At the peak Blockbuster was worldwide and in 2022 J McQueen said that her 32 year old daughter occasionally gets the feeling of wanting to to go to a blockbuster and rent a movie. But, this was no accident. Blockbuster invested millions of dollars into marketing schemes to make concepts like Blockbuster Night popular which got people through the door.\n\nEveryone and their grandma used movie rental services, if you didn’t you weren’t cool. Video rentals was a clear business opportunity because back then on average a Blockbuster store made $1 million dollars. If we adjust for inflation that is $2,000,000 a year. Competitors like Hollywood video saw an opportunity and began to popup all over the US.  Hollywood video were the direct competitors to Blockbuster but offered the same service cheaper and better. Blockbuster’s strategy to remain a key player in the market was to rapidly open stores. And Blockbuster determined their success quarterly by the number of stores they opened. Hollywood video was much smaller than Blockbuster, but they had a full proof strategy. The Hollywood video strategy was to open stores where foot traffic was the highest in Blockbuster stores; and offer cheaper and better services. This was a successful strategy because Hollywood Video had grown from 117 stores to 200 stores in 1996. However Blockbuster was by far larger and many celebrities used their service. This photo of Britney in plain clothes at Blockbuster is significant because it highlights that Blockbuster was part of her lifestyle. So, it seems Blockbuster succeeded in maintaining their brand strength during the movie rental war and were the default choice for many.\n\n**How does the $10 million lawsuit in 1995 filed against Hollywood Entertainment show weakness in the Blockbuster model?**\n\nHowever these two big competitors would clash publicly and it would expose a key flaw in Blockbusters strategy. In 1996 Blockbuster filed a $10M lawsuit against Hollywood entertainment. Blockbuster sued (Talahassee Democrat clipping) on the grounds that Hollywood Video caused irreparable damage to their business. Blockbuster claimed that the employees at Hollywood Video were involved in finding key sites for Blockbuster stores and knew trade secrets. And, Blockbuster followed up with an additional lawsuit that accused Hollywood video of poached their employees. Hollywood video offered a better product and service and was a threat to Blockbuster. This lawsuit was a strike by Blockbuster to slow Hollywood videos growth so that Blockbuster could maintain its growth rate. But; blockbuster size is one of the reasons they would eventually fail. Their ground operations were large and clunky so any important adaptations to the business model were often avoided unless necessary.\n\nBut there is one small snag. A third small component of the movie rental wars was unaccounted for. Small indie rental chains. Small indie rental chains could out-compete the big companies like Blockbuster and Hollywood video. The small chains could pivot faster than the big chains. Smaller chains could offer similar prices and their success worked based on the loyalty from the locals. The three way rivalry would going on in a lot of these locations until 1997. A Redditor who worked at a small company recalled being fine with the competition from the big companies but other threats like mail order processing would end up killing the small indie businesses.\n\nWhen it comes to legal battles the client with the most money has the upper hand. But, in may 1995 a judge ruled that blockbuster had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm from the hiring. The judge ruled in favour of Hollywood video which meant that they successfully defended the $10M law suit. The lawsuit against the two former employees were settled but the details remain confidential and were not disclosed. This lawsuit shows that the edge in the market really was location. The more reach geographically these companies had the more revenue they could generate. And that was a strength and a significant weakness for Blockbuster.\n\n**How did the Blockbuster IPO in 1999 exacerbate the flaws in the Blockbuster model?**\n\nAlan Payne secretly wrote a first hand account working for Blockbuster. He started as an entrepreneur in 1985 where he realised the video rental potential. He started buying multiple [franchises](https://brandoncwhite.com/alan-payne-is-an-entrepreneur-who-built-an-incredibly-profitable-blockbuster-franchise-while-blockbuster-was-going-bust-a-must-listen-ep-91-business-podcast/) to build his business empire. Although Blockbuster was the dominant player there was some financial troubles brewing. In 1996 the average annual revenue in the US declined 20 percent from $900,000 to $700,000 over three years. The store sales were not keeping pace with the store openings and given the fixed costs of opening and running the business this trend pretty much guaranteed financial problems. Alan Payne noticed that there was dramatic decline years before any new technologies would pose legitimate threats. The current threats were other establishments and cost of operations. Alan Payne employed different strategies to compete with other video rental brands and was having much better success. However, he wasn’t asked why his stores were performing so well by key corporate employees.\n\nBy 1997 Blockbuster was desperate to improve their business model during the downturn. In a period of 4 years Blockbuster brought in three different CEOs. Under Steve Berrard (1987 - 1996) leadership, Blockbuster continued to do exactly what it had been doing the past eight years. They opened stores, ignored competition, and increasingly misjudged the evolving tastes of movie renters. But at the time Redstone realised they needed to generate revenue from other sources for Blockbuster so they brought in Bill Fields(1996) who was involved in Walmart. His aim was to increase cash flow by 20 percent in two years by selling music, books, magazines, clothing and video games at Blockbuster stores. Anything but movies to rent. Blockbuster was nothing like Walmart. Nothing Fields implemented worked, so Redstone replaced him with *John Antioco(1997)* who is known for turning down a $50M bid for Netflix.\n\nViacom &amp; Redstone made a huge miscalculation. Wall street had valued the company 5 billion dollars less than what Viacom bought it for. Viacom made a private bid on Blockbuster in 1994 and took over the company for $8.4B. Five years later in 1999 Viacom took the company public with its 9000 stores globally with a market cap of $4B. That’s a $5 Billion dollar loss. However, Blockbuster was bought with the purpose of generating cash flow, but that cash flow never happened. The real reason why Viacom needed Blockbuster was to help finance their bid for Paramount; in the bidding war with QVC network. A combination of rapid expansion and an industry downturn meant that its flaws were exacerbated, and Viacom’s stock cratered. Blockbuster’s financials were made public at IPO and wall street was less than interested in expansion and more in cash flow. However, Blockbuster wasn’t a victim of this immediate downturn, but its lack of managing the details would finally catch up to it a few years later when opening stores was no longer an option\n\nEventually small video store chains fell off and [Hollywood Video](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9125453/statesman-journal/) and Blockbuster took the fight to the stock market. Both companies raised capital on the stock market to continue their war and out compete each other.  But neither company could foresee the technological advancements that would eventually wipe them all out.",

        "author": "ByzantineBasileus",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/zbnds2/a_badhistory_review_overly_sarcastic_productions/",
        "text": "Hello, those of r/badhistory! Today I am going to review another video by Overly Sarcastic Products, a Youtube channel that is one of the worst things to happen to history since Zecariah Sitchin learned how to speak Sumerian. The video is called History Summarized – Classical India:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvbpdBfRgnY\n\nSo let us start!\n\n0:29: The narrator states that the period of Indian history they are studying tells a cohesive and consistent story. Okay, how to parse this assertion? History is not a story. Calling it a story suggests there is a beginning, middle, and end. Any attempt to categorize the past in such a manner is often imposing a narrative or greater sense of meaning. This in turn carries the risk of misinterpreting or twisting history so it matches a person's preconceived notions, which is bad academic practice.\n\n1.17: The narrator says that because the different regions of India maintained their local culture, it made it pretty tricky for one state to unify parts of India for a few decades at a time. Saying that there was a single factor that led to the failure to form an extensive governmental entity is a huge simplification. What about other elements like geography, administrative organization, or a sustainable and effective military establishment? For example, how did the plateaus and semi-arid environment affect efforts to conquer and incorporate the Deccan? What kind of taxation system could best raise the revenue required to maintain armies, and how successful were states in implementing such systems? That the narrator does not discuss such subjects shows a lack of research and critical analysis.\n\n3.24: The narrator asserts the states of Chola, Chera, and Pandya were possibly India’s most successful merchants. Evidence for this? Can they compare the recorded volume of trade with places like Sindh, Gujurat, or the various governments in the Bay of Bengal through that period of history? Since they cannot, such a comparative claim has no basis.\n\n4.49: The narrator says the Satavahana Dynasty was the first in India to start building temples from stone. An absolutist statement, and so is inherently inaccurate. The remains of structures built from brick, and dating from the 3rd century BC onwards, have been found in northern India. These are believed to be indicative of temples.\n\n6.40: When listing the different cultures India interacted with during the period, the narrator lists the Sassanians and Persians as separate. This is a mind-boggling decision as the Sassanians *were* a Persian civilization.\n\n6.43: The narrator states that the empires previously listed would play ‘villain of the week.’ Classic presentism. OSP is making a moral evaluation of the past based on today’s morals. How else would one come to the conclusion that a historical polity is a ‘villain’? This is the worst kind of badhistory.\n\n7.19: The map of the Gupta Empire from 400 AD is missing significant portions of western India that they were ruling over by this date.\n\n8.54: The narrator states Muslims from the Abbasid Caliphate arrived in the Indus valley. This actually occurred during the Umayyad Caliphate, in 711 AD.\n\n9.30: The narrator asserts the Ghurid Sultanate was ‘not very relevant’ when it came to Indian history. This statement is totally correct, if one’s definition of ‘totally correct’ translated to ‘ludicrously wrong’. The Ghurid Sultanate was quite relevant. One of their rulers, Muhummad of Ghor, defeated the Rajput ruler Prithviraja II at the second Battle of Tarain in 1192 AD. This battle was one of the events that broke the power of the Rajputs in Northern India and led to the conquest in Delhi. It was from this foundation that further advances occurred and Muslim power was consolidated.\n\n9.40: Continuing the trend of wrongess, the narrator says cavalry was ‘not really a thing’ in India prior to the Delhi Sultanate. I will be sure to mention this to the Rajputs during my next time travel excursion, and tell them to stop using cavalry.\n\n11.22: The narrator states history can sometimes feel almost deliberately incomprehensible. Only to those who don't study the sources correctly. \n\nAnd that, thankfully, is it!\n\nSources\n\nAncient Southeast Asia, by John N.

        "text": "Now, sir, this story has got many versions in it. Throughout South Africa, amongst many tribes, you’ll find stories of these amazing creatures who are capable of changing from reptile to human being, and from reptile to any other animal of their choice. And these creatures, sir, do really exist. No matter where you go throughout Southern, Eastern, Western, and Central Africa, you’ll find that the description of these creatures is the same. Even amongst tribes which never, throughout their long history, had contact with each other at all.\nSo, there ARE such creatures. Where they come from, I will never claim to know, sir. But they are associated with certain stars in the sky, and one of these stars is a large group of stars which is part of the Milky Way, which our people call Ingiyab, which means “The Great Serpent”. And there is a red star, a redish star, near the tip of this huge rim of stars which our people call IsoneNkanyamba.\nNow, this star called IsoneNkanyamba, I managed to find its English name. It is the star called Alpha Centauri, in English. Now, this, sir, is something that is worth investigating. Why is it that well over 500 tribes in parts of Africa which I’ve visited in the last 40 or 50 years or so, all of them describe similar creatures?\nIt is said that these creatures feed on us human beings; that they, at one time, challenged God Himself to war, because they wanted full control of the universe. And God fought a terrible battle against them and He defeated them, injured them, and forced them to hide in cities underground. They hide in deep cavities underground, because they are always feeling cold. In these cavities, we are told, there are huge fires which are kept going by slaves, human, zombie-like slaves. And, it is further said that these Zuswazi, these Imbulu, or whatever you choose to call them, are not capable of eating solid food. They either eat human blood, or they eat that power, the energy that is generated when human beings, on the surface of the Earth, are fighting and killing each other in large numbers. I met people who have fled from the early Masaki in Rwanda, from years ago, and these people were horrified by what was happening in their country. They said that the slaughter of the Hutus by the Watusi, and the Watusi by the Hutus, is actually feeding the Imanujela, monsters. Because the Imanujela like to inhale the energy that is generated by masses of people being terrified or being killed by other people.",

        "text": "**Introduction**\n\nPreviously I reviewed The Woman King's [trailer](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/w8mku6/the_woman_kings_history_problem_how_accurate/). In this post I'm reviewing the actual movie, which departed in some ways from both the trailer and the original marketing.\n\nThe movie opens with this narration.\n\n&gt;The African Kingdom of Dahomey is at a crossroads. A new king, Ghezo, has just taken power. Their enemy, the Oyo Empire, has joined forces with the Mahi people to raid Dahomey villages and sell their captives to European slavers, an evil trade that has pulled both nations into a vicious circle. The powerful Oyo  have new guns and horses, but the young king has his own fearsome weapon: an elite force of female soldiers, the Agojie, led by a general, Nanisca. Now, these warriors are all that stand between the Oyo and Dahomey’s annihilation.\n\nThis is the narrative which the entire movie seeks to support. However, despite the movie’s marketing insisting on its historical accuracy, despite the movie’s writers, director, and producers making statements such as “We didn’t want to shy away from the truth”, that they “Worked really hard to ground it in what we felt would be the reality of this history”, and saying they consulted historians to ensure the movie’s accuracy, this very narrative which opens the movie is wildly inaccurate.\n\n&gt;\"The director did a deep dive into research about Dahomey and the Agojie alongside production designer Akin McKenzie before reaching out to historical consultant Leonard Wantchekon, who is directly related to a member of the Agojie.\", Sonaiya Kelley, “The Truth behind ‘The Woman King’: Crew Responds to Claims of Historical Revisionism,” *Los Angeles Times*, 28 September 2022\n\nThe entire movie commits the very same kind of whitewashing and historical revisionism as previous movies such as Gods and Generals and Birth of a Nation. This review covers these topics.\n\n1. Europeans abolished slavery before Dahomey.\n2. Dahomey’s Minon (“Amazons”) were enthusiastic slave raiders.\n3. Dahomey’s king Ghezo opposed the abolition of slavery.\n4. Dahomey used slaves to produce palm oil.\n\nFor a video version of this review, go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg9ywyeOT6M).\n\n**Europeans abolished slavery before Dahomey**\n\nHistorically, these events are taking place no later than 1823, the year of the Dahomey rebellion against the Oyo empire. Although the movie depicts Europeans as enthusiastic slave traders and some of Dahomey’s elites as opponents of slavery, in reality the facts were the other way around.\n\nThe British had already outlawed the Atlantic slave trade in 1807,\\[1\\] and created the West Africa Squadron, a collection of British Navy warships, to enforce the ban in Africa. However, slavery in the British colonies was not abolished until 1833. In 1819 the US Navy also made some, admittedly weak efforts to prevent the Atlantic slave trade. In contrast, Dahomey was doing nothing but supporting the slave trade as much as possible, and actively opposing European attempts at abolition.\n\nIn 1815 Portugal agreed to stop all slave trading north of the equator, though it continued to ship slaves from West Africa to Brazil, and France abolished the slave trade in 1815, though it didn’t outlaw slavery in its colonies until 1848. Spain agreed to cease slave trading north of the equator in 1818, and south of the equator by 1820, and in 1826 Brazil agreed to stop slave trading north of the equator.\n\nThese anti-slavery efforts of the European powers were very slow in coming, very slow to implement, and very imperfectly enforced. However, they were considerably more of an effort at the abolition of slavery than anything Dahomey had ever done in its entire history. \n\nIn 1823, when the movie’s conversation between Ghezo and his advisors took place, Dahomey was still an enthusiastic participant in the slave trade, the Minon were conducting slave raids, and Ghezo was strongly opposed to ending the slave trade. European nations on the other hand had already started abolishing slavery years before. Yet the conversation between Ghezo and his advisors makes the Dahomey look like the enlightened abolitionists, and the Europeans the backwards and barbarous defenders of slavery. This is a reversal of the facts, and a deliberate whitewashing of history.\n\nIn the movie, main character Nanisca says “The white man has brought immorality here. They will not stop until the whole of Africa is theirs to enslave”. This is sheer anachronism. Firstly it explicitly places the blame for slavery entirely on Europeans, representing slavery as an external evil brought to Africa by white men. In turn this implies slavery was not practiced in Africa prior to European contact.\n\nSecondly it represents Nanisca as having a conception of “the whole of Africa”, which would have been completely alien to her. Thirdly it represents her as believing that the Europeans aimed to enslave all of Africa, which they never intended to do, and in fact never tried.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Ghezo says “The Europeans and the Americans have seen if you want to hold a people in chains, one must first convince they are meant to be bound. We joined them in becoming our own oppressors, but no more. No more. We are a warrior people, and there is power in our mind. In our unity. In our culture. If we understand that power, we will be limitless. My people, this is the vision I will lead. It is a vision that we share”. This is all totally anachronistic. Ghezo went on to pursue the slave trade for decades until forced to stop by the French.\n\n**Dahomey’s Minon (“Amazons”) were enthusiastic slave raiders**\n\nTo its credit, the movie does show Dahomey involved in the slave trade. At 12:15, 12:29-30, we see slaves with their hands tied and heads bowed, being kept in the part of the palace where the MInon are training. At 12:47-51, Nawi is told “Some of the men who raided our village. The rest will be sold, in Ouyida”. The port of Ouyida was a major hub for the slave trade, and Dahomey is estimated to have sold at least one million slaves through this port over a couple of centuries.\n\nHowever, in this scene the only people identified as slaves are bad people, described as “men who raided our village”. There is no mention of the fact that the Dahomey Minon, or “Amazons”, were used by Dahomey as slave raiders to capture men, women, and children from Dahomey’s neighbors, to use as slaves for Dahomey’s domestic slave market, or sell them as slaves to Europeans, or use them as human sacrifices in Dahomey’s annual ritual in honor of the king, in which slaves, criminals, and captives of war were beheaded to celebrate Dahomey’s monarch.\n\nLater Ghezo is discussing politics with his advisors. At 16:32 one of his advisors notes “Dahomey has prospered in the peace”, to which Nansica replies “The slave trade is the reason we prosper, but at what price? It is a poison slowly killing us, and the Europeans know this. They come to our land for their human cargo”.\n\nThis is historical revisionism, placing modern sentiments in the mouth of a historical figure. There is no evidence anyone in Dahomey was thinking this way at the time that the movie’s events are set, around 1823. It is true that the slave trade was the reason why Dahomey prospered, but there is no indication that Ghezo or any of his advisors thought that this was a bad thing, certainly not a poison killing the nation. Note also how Nanisca calls the slaves “their human cargo”, as if the Europeans are responsible for the African slave trade. She doesn’t say “They come to our land for the humans we have enslaved and turned into cargo to sell so we can profit from them”.\n\nAnother advisor interjects “They’ve come to trade, we sell them what they want”. Nanisca responds “But why do we sell our captives? For weapons? To capture more people, to sell for more weapons?”. Well yes, that’s exactly what Dahomey were actually doing. However, Izogie, one of the Minon, agrees with Nanisca, saying “It is a dark circle with no end. This is not the way”. Again, this is just wishful thinking, making historical people say things which are acceptable to a modern audience, and attempting to present the Minon as opponents of the slave trade. In reality they were not only slave raiders, they were enthusiastic supporters of the slave trade, and regularly urged Ghezo to continue it.\n\nWhen Nanisca asks “why do we sell our captives”, it sounds like the Dahomey are just selling their prisoners of war, whereas in fact many of their captives were not prisoners of war, but civilians caught by the Dahomey specifically to sell as slaves. As to why they sold them, it was to make money, buy guns, and expand the Dahomey Empire even further. Other slaves were captured by the Dahomey to use as sources of agricultural labor, a point which will become particularly important when we look at what the movie has to say about Dahomey’s involvement in the palm oil trade.\n\nNotably, the movie never provides the slaves of the Dahomey with a voice, or any agency. We are never permitted to hear their perspective, see them opposing their own slavery, or see them resisting or escaping. They are silenced and stripped of agency.\n\n**Dahomey’s king Ghezo opposed the abolition of slavery**\n\nAt 43:02, the villain Santo Ferriera is introduced. He is represented as a Portuguese slave trader who helped King Ghezo seize the throne in a coup. This villain is based on the real-life historical figure of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a Brazilian slave trader who was extremely influential in West Africa, who certainly did enable Ghezo’s ascension to the throne through a coup, and who was his reliable ally and major slave trading partner.\\[2\\]\n\nIn the movie, Ferriera uses a fort in Ouidah as his base. This is fort, Forte de São João Baptista de Ajudá, was originally bult by the Portuguese to support their slave trade. However, by the time of the movie it was no longer occupied by the Portuguese, due to European anti-slavery efforts. It was an abandoned shell in 1823. Although de Souza, the historical figure on whom the movie’s character Ferreira is based, did take possession of it in the 1820s, he did not use it as a base for his own slavery operations, and it remained abandoned.\n\nAround this time in the movie Nanisca says to Ghezo “Let's not be an empire that sells its people. Let us be an empire who loves its people”. Ghezo says “My brothers sold our own, I will never do that”. Nanisca says “Even if they are not Dahomey, they are still our people”. There are a couple of problems here. \n\nThe first is that Ghezo certainly did sell his own. In fact by this very stage of the movie, he had already done it. Historian Ana Lucia Araujo explains that when Ghezo’s his coup succeeded, and he seized the throne in 1818, “he punished his half-brother’s family members by selling them into slavery outside the kingdom’s borders”.\\[3\\]   \n\nNot only that, but Araujo also says that by 1825 Ghezo had become unpopular among his own people “for selling Dahomean subjects”. So he literally was selling some of his very own people, Dahomey citizens, into slavery.\\[4\\]\n\nThe other problem is that Nanisca’s statement that even African people who are not Dahomey are “still our people”, is anachronistic pan-Africanism. During this time there was no sense of a united African people with a shared identity. There were hundreds of ethnic groups, each with their own distinct identity, language, and culture, who not only differentiated themselves from each other but did not see each other as united by any single shared identity. They did not think of themselves or others as Africans, and they certainly did not see themselves as sharing any kind of kinship, either literal or figurative.\n\nOn this point, Kenyan historian Ali AlʾAmin Mazrui wrote, somewhat controversially, “it remains one of the great ironies of modern African history that it took European colonialism to remind Africans that they were Africans”.\\[5\\]\n\nLater in the movie Ghezo speaks with Santo, who comments “So you wish to sell palm oil”. Ghezo replies “I wish for my people to prosper, as those of your land do”. Santo says “Ghezo, the people in my lands prosper because of the slave trade, and this very same trade has made you rich, as rich as the king of England. If you stop the trade, you will be nothing”. He adds that the slave traders will “take their business elsewhere”, to which Ghezo replies “The business of selling Africans?”. \n\nAgain, there are a couple of problems here. Firstly this is more anachronistic pan-Africanism. In reality Ghezo did not think of people as “Africans”. Note also the careful framing of the business of selling Africans as something Europeans do, not something that African kingdoms do. This is particularly ironic given that Dahomey itself was in the business of selling slaves.\n\nSecondly, if Feirreia is supposed to be Portuguese it is very odd that he is referring to his people enjoying the wealth of the slave trade, and does not mention Portugal had already outlawed slave trading above the equator. This is further evidence that Feirreia is based on de Souza, the Brazilian, since Brazil had yet to outlaw the slave trade in any region.\n\nThe movie consistently represents Feirreira as the powerful and predatory European slave trader, and Gezo as the weak and submissive local ruler who is reluctantly compelled to participate in a trade from which he cannot escape. In reality Ghezo held all the power, and participated in the slave trade deliberately, because it made him very powerful and wealthy.\n\nSince an anti-slave trade party did emerge within Dahomey in the middle of the nineteenth century, supported by a group of wealthy merchants who had invested heavily in the palm oil trade, Araujo says “historians have perceived Gezo’s reign as a period of transition from the illegal slave trade to the legitimate trade of palm oil”. However, she disputes this, observing “in the early years of his reign, Gezo continued to contend that the slave trade was a central part of the kingdom’s revenue”.\\[6\\]\n\nIn fact, Araujo observes, under Ghezo the total number of slaves sold from his port at Ouidah was even larger than under the previous king of Dahomey, and “the annual averages of slave exports were very similar”.\\[7\\] \n\nOne of Ghezo’s most infamous statements, made in 1849 not only declared his unwavering determination to maintain the slave trade, but also insisted that it was essential to his people’s culture and economy. The statement, part of which has been much quoted since the release of The Woman King, reveals just how dedicated Ghezo was to preserving slavery. Ghezo said “I and my army are ready, at all times, to fight the queen's enemies, and do any thing the English government may ask of me, except to give up the slave-trade. No other trade is known to my people”. He also explicitly rejected palm oil and other forms of income as substitutes.\\[8\\] \n\nGhezo insisted on slavery as a perfectly respectable tradition of his people, explaining “The slave-trade has been the ruling principle of my people. It is the source of their glory and wealth. Their songs celebrate their victories, and the mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to slavery”.\\[9\\]   \n\nIt would be anachronistic to place this actual statement in the movie, given that Ghezo didn’t make it until around 25 years after the date of the movie’s events. However, it is misleading at best, and dishonest at worst, for the movie to represent Ghezo as merely a reluctant participant in the slave trade, only selling slaves because a Portuguese trader told him to. The fact that Ghezo is portrayed consistently as a fearful pawn of European powers is completely inaccurate. In reality Ghezo felt absolutely no concern about completely rejecting the requests of even the British government, despite their anti-slavery naval blockade.\n\nGhezo’s depiction in the movie is symptomatic of one of its key problems; in this movie Dahomeans only do bad things because other people force them to. Ghezo only sells slaves because a Portuguese trader tells him he has to, and Dahomey’s warriors only capture slaves because the Oyo empire requires them to.\n\nNot only is this historically inaccurate, it’s a deliberate attempt to absolve them of responsibility for their actions. It is also completely undermined later when Ghezo and his people decide to just stop doing what other people tell them to, which they could have simply done in the first place.\\[10\\]\n\n**Dahomey used slaves to produce palm oil**\n\nAt 17:11 Nanisca says “We have other things to sell; corn, palm oil, we can double our harvest”, adding “I want Dahomey to survive”. Ghezo agrees reluctantly to pay the tribute, promising it will be the last time, and comments “As for the palm oil, Nanisca, show me, show me how much you can produce and we will see”. \n\nAgain, this is historical fabrication. At this time in Dahomey’s history there was no domestic push to abolish the slave trade and replace it with palm oil sales. In fact as we’ll see later, it wasn’t until at around 20 years later that the British pressured a reluctant King Ghezo to stop selling slaves and sell palm oil instead. We’ll also learn more about another unfortunate fact the movie doesn’t reveal; Dahomey’s domestic palm oil industry also used slavery.\n\nAt 50:40 Workers are seen farming palms for palm oil. Nanisca says “This field alone produces thousands of barrels of palm oil. If we harvest many fields each year, we will have a continuous supply to trade”. Ghezo replies “I never saw a path before Nanisca, but look at this, now I do”. Nanisca responds “Vision is seeing what others do not”.\n\nAs mentioned previously, this is completely inaccurate. Neither Ghezo nor his advisors were attempting to transition from selling slaves to selling palm oil at this point in time. Dahomey didn’t even start producing palm oil in export quantities until the 1840s, and only then as a result of intense pressure by the British, who were trying to persuade Ghezo to end his involvement in the slave trade.\\[11\\]\n\nBut there’s more. When advocates for palm oil did emerge in Dahomey, Ghezo was not one of them. In fact he directly opposed a shift in economy from slavery to palm oil. In 1848 he wrote a letter to Queen Victoria explicitly requesting that he be permitted to maintain his monopoly on the West African slave trade, and even asking the queen to prevent European traders visiting the ports of his rivals, explaining that he was concerned the trade was making them wealthy and enabling them to resist his authority.\\[12\\]\n\nNot only that, he actively tried to suppress the palm oil trade of his neighbors. In this same letter requested the British remove all palm oil factories from neighboring regions, so that instead merchants would buy products from his own port at Ouidah, including of course slaves, explaining directly that this would increase his tax revenue. He also asked that the queen “send him some good Tower guns and blunderbusses, and plenty of them”, so that he could make war on his neighbors.\\[13\\]\n\nIn his 2020 article The Bight of Benin: Dahomey and the Dominance of Export Slavery, Angus Dalrymple-Smith explains that Ghezo actively rejected switching to the palm oil trade, writing “the state instead focused its efforts on military campaigns and reviving the slave trade”.\\[14\\]\n\nBy the 1830s, British efforts to shut down the slave trade were starting to interfere with Dahomey’s profits. In response, Dalrymple-Smith notes, “the Dahomeans responded by developing more elaborate strategies to avoid the British blockade”.\\[15\\] Ghezo was determined to preserve his kingdom’s main source of power and revenue, regardless of efforts to stop him.\n\nDuring the 1840s Ghezo went so far as to send Queen Victoria a letter explaining that it was impossible for him to end the slave trade and replace it with the palm oil industry, firstly, he said, because it was in conflict with his people’s culture, and secondly, he said, because he would lose money. He wrote “At present my people are a warlike people and unaccustomed to agricultural pursuits. I should not be enabled to keep up my revenue were I at once to stop the slave trade”.\\[16\\]\n\nGhezo’s claim that he coud not create a palm oil industry to replace the slave trade because his people were “accustomed to agricultural pursuits”, was very obviously a complete fabrication and an empty excuse to defend his perpetuation of the slave trade. In case there is any doubt about this, it is demonstrated indisputably by the fact that Ghezo eventually realised he could earn money from both the slave trade and the palm oil trade at the same time.\\[17\\]\n\nConsequently, Ghezo made a law requiring all palm oil plantations to pay him a special tax in the form of a percentage of the oil they produced, and also “declared the palm a sacred tree which it was forbidden to cut down”. This particularly shrewd act of ecological conservation ensured the tree would be preserved for economic exploitation.\\[18\\]\n\nNow we must return to another awkward fact about Dahomehy’s palm plantations. Despite the movie’s heavy emphasis on Dahomey’s development of the palm oil industry as a replacement for the slave trade, it completely omits to mention the fact that Dahomey’s plantations used slaves. Although many of the farms were privately owned by Dahomey citizens, they used many slaves in their workforce. Not only that, but Ghezo permitted the Brazilian slave trader de Souza to operate his own palm oil plantations using slave labor. \n\nFirst Ghezo made money from de Souza by selling him the slaves, then he made more money from de Souza by taking a percentage of the oil from de Souza’s plantations, and selling it to increase the royal income.\\[19\\] Ghezo was effectively profiting from the slave trade twice over; firstly by continuing to sell slaves, and secondly by taxing palm oil plantations which used slave labor. This particular stroke of economic genius is never mentioned in The Woman King.\\[20\\]\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, in 1841 Ghezo also permitted the French Régis company to continue its clandestine involvement in the slave trade, and set up its own palm oil plantations using slaves. Ghezo earned large sums of money by taxing the palm oil production of de Souza and the Regis company, so he was literally profiting from their exploitation of the slaves they purchased from Dahomey and other enslavers.\\[21\\]\n\nHowever, Ghezo didn’t stop there. Not content with earning money from the foreign slave traders by selling them slaves to work in their plantations and then taking a cut of their palm oil production, he also set up his own plantations, which of course also used slave labor. This led to an even greater use of slaves in Dahomey than ever before.\n\nSoumoni writes that the loss of Dahomey’s access to the broader slave trade, especially the American slave market,“made for a more widespread exploitation of slave labour in the King's own palm plantations and in those of other royal dignitaries”. He attributes this directly to Ghezo’s actions, writing “the big palm oil boom in Dahomey was subsequent to the setting up of the Regis factory in which enterprise both Ghezo and de Souza played decisive roles”.\\[22\\]\n\nHistorian Patrick Manning explains that as a result of Ghezo’s desire to earn money from palm oil as well as slavery, “The slave-labor sector also expanded to meet the demand for palm products, probably at a greater rate than the commodity exchange sector”. He explains how the Dahomey monarchy, warlords, officials, and merchants, all became involved in establishing plantations, not only in Dahomey’s territory but also “around the major Yoruba cities”.\\[23\\]\n\nThese plantations often used Yoruba people as slaves. Having defeated the Yoruba kingdom and freed themselves from its system of tribute, Dahomey promptly turned around and enslaved the Yoruba. Although Dahomey’s palm oil plantations did use enslaved Dahomey people themselves, Dalrymple-Smith writes “foreign slaves were usually preferred, as their labor could be more intensively exploited than slaves who shared a common cultural/linguistic heritage with their masters”.\\[24\\]\n\nHe adds “male Yoruba slaves were among the first to be used to increase palm oil production, despite their unwillingness to be involved in what was considered ‘female work’”. He also explains that although this practice began in the 1840s, it was not widespread until the following decade.\\[25\\]\n\nNaturally the Yoruba did not appreciate being enslaved in this way, and in 1855 there was a Yoruba slave revolt in the Dahomey city of Abhomey. However, it was quickly suppressed. Manning writes that this revolt “provides an indication of the scale of slavery and the severity of exploitation at that time”.\\[26\\]\n\nThe historical facts completely contradict The Woman King’s narrative. Ghezo was never convinced to replace slavery with palm oil production, since, as Dalrymple-Smith writes, “For the Dahomean monarchy and its elite supporters, palm oil was far less profitable than slave trading”.\\[27\\] Even though the production of palm oil used slaves, the process of producing and transporting the oil was labor and time intensive, making it much more lucrative and time efficient to simply sell the slaves in the first place. \n\nConsequently, Dalrymple-Smith observes “from the seventeenth to the middle of the nineteenth century it was never in the interests of the elites to stimulate a non-slave export trade”. Again, this completely contradicts The Woman King’s presentation of Ghezo as a reluctant participant in the slave trade who was searching for an alternative source of revenue to replace it.\\[28\\]\n\nDalrymple-Smith further writes that Dahomey’s dedication to the slave trade “was strengthened by the development of an elite ideology that glorified war and opposed any other trade except in slaves”, adding that “This was strong enough to survive into the nineteenth century in spite of the general decline of the transatlantic slave trade”.\\[29\\]\n\nThis arrangement of effectively profiting twice over from the slave trade, firstly by selling slaves and secondly by using slave labor to produce palm oil, was so lucrative that many of Dahomey’s elites continued to resist ending slavery even as the transatlantic slave trade was dying out. Not only that, but after Ghezo’s death, according to Dalrymple-Smith, Glele, the next king of Dahomey “attempted to re-orientate the state back towards a slave raiding model”.\\[30\\]\n\nSo, far from the palm oil industry being the method by which Ghezo ended and replaced the slave trade, as The Woman King represents, instead it was a method by which Ghezo added to his already lucrative income from the slave trade, by exploiting not only his own palm oil slave laborers, but the slave laborers on the plantations of domestic and foreign palm oil producers. Once more we find the actual historical facts are radically different from the way they are presented in The Woman King.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe movie's director, Gina Prince-Blythewood, [has attempted to defend the movie against charges of historical revisionism](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2022-09-28/woman-king-true-story-explained-revisionist-history-debunked), insisting on its accuracy.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/z5l8nl/substacks_michael_tracey_has_a_hot_take_about_the/",
        "text": "[Here](https://mtracey.substack.com/p/a-fairy-tale-version-of-world-war?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2) it is. It's **ten thousand words**, but I've saved yous the trouble of reading it, and been as thorough as I could. TLDR: \"FDR was a liar, Bomber Harris was Satan, and the Nazis weren't exterminating the Jews until after the USA entered the war.\"\n\nContext about Michael: he's a \"left\"-wing journalist à la Glenn Greenwald. He goes on Tucker. He likes Tulsi Gabbard. Now his shtick is denouncing Lend-Lease to Ukraine. He spent most of the fall [tweeting](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fc-qS3OWIAAasU9?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096) that the 1941 Lend-Lease Act had been part of FDR's scheme to get the US into the war. Of course, people responded that fighting Hitler was good. Tracey bit the bullet, and countered that fighting Hitler was *not* good. Hence, this article.\n\nIn it, Tracey treats the Holocaust as a low-level thing that boiled over once Hitler realized that he'd have to fight the USA. This *superficially* resembles a school of thought called [\"functionalism\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism%E2%80%93intentionalism_debate), which holds that as the war became increasingly savage, SS units began murdering Jews on their own initiative, and the Reich's leadership then coordinated these killings into the Final Solution. But **no** functionalist historian argues that \"the Allies provoked Germany into killing the Jews.\" That's just Tracey.\n\n---\n\nThe first half focuses on how Roosevelt used a salami-slicing strategy to get a reluctant US public ready for war. Tracey claims that FDR strategically antagonized Germany and Japan while supporting Britain, the USSR, and China more openly, betting that eventually one of the Axis powers would attack the US and give the US a valid causus belli. Tracey emphasizes the following actions:\n\n* Lend-Lease\n\n* The deployment of US Marines to Iceland\n\n* The three US-German naval clashes in the fall of 1941\n\n* The oil embargo on Japan\n\nThis claim—that FDR wanted to intervene, and built the necessary political climate for it—might be *descriptively* correct. But in my opinion, that makes FDR a great president. He wanted to do the right thing, and he found a way despite major political obstacles.\n\n---\n\n**The Inevitable Dresden**\n\nTracey then focuses on Allied \"terror bombings\" like Dresden. Interestingly, while he's a pseudo-functionalist about the Holocaust, he's downright intentionalist about the Allied bombing campaigns. He repeatedly alleges that the Allies' intention, from day 1, was to wage war by area-bombing enemy cities:\n\n&gt; There is no coherent way to separate the justifiability of these deliberate, civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns from the justifiability of entering the war. Because **a foundational feature of the war was these deliberate civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns.** \"Deliberate, civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns\" are no more separable from World War II than [...] \"house frame\" is separable from \"house.\"\n\nHe's incredibly dishonest. If you didn't know much about WWII and you read this essay, you might think that city-bombing was an Allied invention. Take this:\n\n&gt; The first “city bombing attack” conducted by British forces was in Mannheim, Germany on **December 16, 1940**\n\nNotice that date? Well, Tracey doesn't mention that the Luftwaffe launched the [Battle of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain) on **July 10, 1940**. And by early September, the Luftwaffe changed strategies, turning the Battle of Britain into an 8-month city-bombing campaign called [the Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz) that would kill 40,000 civilians. The Luftwaffe bombed Coventry [exactly one month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Blitz) before the RAF attacked Mannheim.\n\nCoventry wasn't an exception. The Luftwaffe's doctrine [had always included Terrorangriffe](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0012_MURRAY_STRATEGY_FOR_DEFEAT.pdf) – literally, \"terror attacks.\" Starting in November 1940, almost *every* major German raid on Britain was a Terrorangriff. The very last raid of the Blitz, which struck [London on May 11 1941](https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/research-enquiries/history-of-aviation-timeline/british-military-aviation/1941-2/), was one of the largest and deadliest raids of the war to date.\n\nBritain wasn't the first country to experience this. The Nazis literally started the war with terror-strikes on Warsaw in 1939. According to historian [James Corum](https://securityanddefence.pl/pdf-103158-36243?filename=The%20Luftwaffes%20campaigns.pdf):\n\n&gt; Von Richthofen believed that massive air attacks upon the city would break Polish morale and force a quick surrender - so he planned for a massive aerial attack with all available forces for the 25th of September. **Von Richthofen's attack on Warsaw had characteristics of an indiscriminate terror raid**... The Ju 52s flew over the city as airmen shoveled thousands of incendiary bombs out the cargo doors - nothing that one could describe as attacking only military targets or \"avoiding unnecessary civilian casualties.\"\n\nAnd on May 14 1940, the Nazis did [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_bombing_of_Rotterdam) to Rotterdam. They then [threatened to bomb Utrecht](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/german-invasion-netherlands/) unless the Dutch surrendered. That's the most explicit \"terror bombing\" of the war, done by the Nazis, two years before the RAF began bombing German cities in earnest. FWIW, the RAF retaliated for Rotterdam by bombing [*oil infrastructure*](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-netherlands) in the Ruhr.\n\nSo terror-bombing was SOP for the Nazis from the get-go, and the British endured it for three months before responding in kind. You may now quote Bomber Harris.\n\nGetting back to Michael Tracey: aerial bombing was a \"foundational feature of the war\" because *the Nazis made it a foundational feature.* The Allied air campaign was deadlier than what the Axis did simply because the Allies built better aircraft and had a better doctrine.\n\nTracey is also ignorant about basic philosophy regarding war:\n\n&gt; There’s a conceit that the manner in which a war is conducted can somehow be separated, in terms of moral judgment, from whether launching the war was justified. \n\nThis \"conceit\" is called the *jus ad bellum* versus *jus in bello* distinction. Thomas Aquinas wrote about it in the 13th century. Almost every philosopher since Aquinas has accepted this distinction.\n\n---\n\n**Holocaust Lunacy Starts Here**\n\nAfter **seven thousand words**, Tracey finally says what he wanted to say: that maybe if the US had sat WWII out, there would've been no Holocaust. He starts with a disclaimer that has serious \"I'm not racist, but\" energy:\n\n&gt; I have never claimed, nor am I claiming here, that the US “caused” the Holocaust, or that Nazi Germany bears any less responsibility for the Holocaust [...] What I’m saying is this: there is ample reason to believe [...] that US entry to World War II coincided with — and may well have been a motivating factor in — the acceleration of the most lethal phase of the Holocaust.\n\nIf I may editorialize a bit, I think that Tracey *is* claiming that the US caused the Holocaust. But he knows that he'd look like a clown if he spelled that out, so he's JAQing off as hard as he can.\n\nTracey cites mainstream historians, but he does so dishonestly (eg, turning \"could have been\" statements into \"was\"), a lot of his sources *weaken* what he's trying to say, and the way he interprets some of them is absurd. The worst is when he misuses this quote by Daniel Rafecas of Yad Vashem (emphasis is mine):\n\n&gt; By the fall of 1941 the Nazis [did not have] the required means to undertake a last stage to the Final Solution. In November 1941, the only facilities under construction designed to serve that end were **the gas vans in Chelmno and the three gas chambers at Belzec**.\n\nRafecas can't have meant what Tracey wants him to mean. At most, it sounds like Rafecas means that when the US entered the war, the Nazis accelerated something that they were already preparing to do.\n\nBut here's the important thing: **Tracey is ignoring Chelmno and Belzec.** This is **fucking crazy**. Those camps' existence proves that the Nazis had genocidal intent by 1941. Their sole purpose was to kill every inmate on arrival:\n\n* Chelmno had 7 known survivors out of 150,000 to 200,000 murders.\n\n* Belzec had 7 known survivors out of **400,000 to 500,000 murders.**\n\nTracey also mentions the factoid that the Shoah's first gassings happened at Chelmno on Dec. 8, 1941. It's clear what he's doing. He's implying causality, as if the Nazis decided to start gassing the Jews overnight.\n\nSome of Tracey's sources are just bizarre. They include (he uses screenshots, so I'm linking to those):\n\n* [This excerpt from a book by Laurence Rees](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a3df6b3-075d-413d-b5a3-f315a4412f02_1094x1200.png). It suggests the *opposite* of what Tracey is trying to say: Rees says that the failure of the Moscow offensive \"probably\" would've been enough to motivate Hitler to accelerate the Holocaust.\n\n* [Hitler's Jan. 1939 prediction](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F534252fc-e313-45b2-a980-3bc221ca5925_1186x1150.png) that if another world war broke out, the Jews would be \"annihilated.\" *Hitler* started a war in Europe nine months later. And in December 1941, *Hitler* fulfilled his own \"world war\" condition by declaring war on the US.\n\n* [This highlighted passage](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6b5a1e9-17c8-47e6-8824-2386149d7648_1200x803.png). Hitler attributed the new US-Soviet alliance to Jewish control of both DC and Moscow, rather than to the USA's and USSR's mutual interests. Not the actions of a rational, calculating man.\n\n* [Heinrich Himmler's Posen speech](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a83845d-35ba-41ab-a77e-41d447a41a95_1264x1202.png), in which Himmler congratulated himself for preventing \"sabotage\" by having the Jews exterminated.\n\nI'd argue that if the Nazis could rationalize the Shoah this easily, then genocide was inevitable. It was only a matter of finding the right excuse.\n\n---\n\nThat's enough of Tracey's statements. Now I'll focus on some things that he conspicuously *doesn't* mention\n\n* The word \"Einsatzgruppe\" doesn't appear once\n\n* He says nothing about the Warsaw Ghetto, which was built in October 1940, when FDR was still promising neutrality.\n\n* He doesn't mention the Nazis' genocides of non-Jews. Take the Intelligenzaktion. The Nazis shot about 100,000 Polish intellectuals, army officers, civil servants, writers, priests, and anyone else who might've kept Polish culture alive. The Nazis started this as soon as they invaded, and completed it by the end of 1940.\n\n* He says almost nothing about Operation Barbarossa, which the Nazis launched 3 months before the USS Greer incident (the first clash between the US Navy and the Kriegsmarine).\n\n* He doesn't mention the Holocaust in the Baltics, where the Nazis encouraged local vigilantes to kill Jews in mobs starting in July 1941.\n\n* He doesn't mention the Babi Yar massacre, which happened in September 1941.\n\nAll of the above, of course, happened after the Nazis had invaded and annexed neighboring countries. That's a crime in its own right, but it doesn't seem to bother Tracey.\n\nHe also ignores one of the most recognized facts about genocide: it happens in stages. There's *always* a period of social exclusion, propaganda, and intermittent violence before the perpetrators move to full-blown extermination. The Shoah was like all other genocides in this regard.\n\n---\n\nGod, writing this made me mad. Tracey's very proposal is offensive. By his own admission, the Holocaust was underway before the US entered the war; why else would the Nazis have been building two extermination camps in the fall of 1941? \"Would this monstrous, genocidal regime have killed fewer people if the US had let it do whatever it wanted?\" isn't a question worth asking.",

        "text": "Hey everyone its been a while.  Sorry, life keeps getting in the way.  I do have something special, a deconstruction of my favorite book ever made and how your favorites are also never perfect. \n\nMany people have favorite pieces of literature, sometimes its hard to pick one.  Not for me, I've known my favorite book since my birthday in 2009.  Its, The Sinking of the Eastland: Americas Forgotten Tragedy by Jay Bonansinga.  Its from 2005 and its about the titular disaster on July 24th 1915, where a passengerliner rolled over in the Chicago River killing 844 people, most of whom were immigrants and worked at the Western Electric company.  \n\nBonansinga isn't a historian, he's a novelist.  He probably is best known for writing several Walking Dead novels for Robert Kirkman, but don't let that make it sound like its amateur when it comes to history.  He interviewed every notable historian on the subject, from George W Hilton author of the 1997 book Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic to the Eastland Disaster Historical Society which was founded by descendants of survivors.  He also interviewed the few remaining survivors, talked with relatives of survivors and went over about every unique newspaper article.  The footnotes, citations and endnotes of this book is massive, one third the length even.  \n\nThe book also incorporates period details of Chicago in 1915, the world as a whole, effect of ww1 on 1915 America, beginnings of ragtime and Jazz, great lakes history, shipping history, understandable engineering, and other relevant information.  Its like the better parts of Devil in the White City when Erik Larson isn't quoting bs about HH Holmes. \n\nBonansinga uses his writing talents quite well to emphasize human stories and its done brutally effectively.  Many passages make the heart weep and descriptions of the faces of deceased still contorted in ghastly expressions has stuck with me for over a decade.\n\nIt also features something I wish more historical works included.  A list of what happened to all major historical figures, what lives they lived and how they died.  I've done this in some of my writings as a nod to the book.\n\nI could go on for hours, gushing about how much this book means to me and how much I adore it.  Its a 10/10 in my opinion easy and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the Eastland.  But enough of that, let's gut this sacred goose!  Its not perfect and some of the errors it makes are fascinating due to how primary sources were written and preserved.\n\nThis book loves quoting the Chicago Tribune and the New York Times.  Nothing wrong with that, a lot of primary accounts of the disaster showed up in those papers, Harlan E Babcock was a reporter at the scene and his descriptions are viseral.  But this does lead to problems.\n\nA minor example, in Sinking of the Eastland its written that a police officer had to babysit the children of families who went to morgue to find dead relatives.  I checked the newspaper, it says there were two police officers not one, although the quality of the preserved paper is remarkably poor, so its likely the author couldn't tell.\n\nTwo more spectacular errors exist via this reliance on newspapers.  When discussing the cleaning up of the picnic grounds the Eastland was meant to reach, it says the queen of the carnival, a miss Mary Clark, age 18, died in the disaster.  I checked the New York Times page and it is correct, it says Mark Clark, voted prettiest girl at the company and queen of the parade, died in the sinking. \n\nThere's one problem, there is no Mary Clark listed as a victim of the sinking, and all victims were identified.  There are some people who are claimed to be victims but cannot fully be confirmed, but even this list doesn't include a Mark Clark.\n\nNow according to the Eastland Disaster Historical Society, there was a Mary Ceranek who was 17 and who died in the disaster.  Its a fair assumption the NYT reporter was talking about Mary Ceranek and just made a mistake, no big deal.\n\nWell... Mark Ceranek wasn't queen of the carnival.  The New York Times claim was on July 26th two days after the sinking.  About a month later in the Tribute, there's an obituary for a woman named Louise Radoll, age 26 who died on the Eastland.  Its unusually long, comes with a photo of her, and says she was the queen of the carnival.  This has been fact checked and confirmed by the Eastland Disaster Historical Society, although the newspaper was only recently digitized that featured this information.  \n\nSo the book is half right, a woman named Mary who was 17 or 18 died and the queen of the parade died.  They just happened to be two different people.  But this is a person mentioned once in the book, its a minor detail.  The next one isn't. \n\nIn the early chapters of the book two men are named quite frequently.  Edward Bartlett and Leroy Bennett.  They are called the Eastlands two bartenders, old 50 some boxers who fought at a place called George Kerwins Saloon in the 1890s and were the best of friends.  They tried to save people when the ship capsized and were later found by divers when the bodies were being recovered.  They died hugging each other and this was the last straw for some recovery divers who retired from the scene early.\n\nIf you check records, there is an Edward Bartlett and a Leroy Bennett listed as victims.  So its correct right?  Well... Bartlett is listed as the bartender and is 52.  But Bennett..  is 21.  He wasn't employed by the ship he was just a Western Electric worker, and his only sport was casually playing baseball.  This humanly cannot be the same person mentioned in the book.\n\nThe citation is the Chicago Tribune listed July 25th 1915 and it has all the details plus Bennett having a waiter brother named George.  There is no George Bennett listed as dying.  I also cannot find a George Kerwin Saloon listed anywhere in the United States in the 1890s.  But the divers did report seeing two people embracing each other in death in the bar room of the Eastland.  I believe Edward Bartlett had been a former boxer who died embracing someone in the disaster, but the other person was misidentified and since this is the only source on the man at all beyond a grave marker, Bonansinga just went with it over nothing.  Its unfortunate.\n\nThere's another error in the book and this isn't minor at all.  The timeline of events, the Eastland sank at 7:30 AM this is reported by dozens of witnesses and double checked by historians as fact.  Its also reported the ship reached full capacity at 7:10 AM, survivors of the ships crew reported this.  But Sinking of the Eastland said it was at 7:20 AM that capacity of passengers was hit.  No other book or documentary has ever claimed this and even I wrote it wrong when making my project on the ship.\n\nBut I see what happened.  Capacity was reached at 7:10, but the gangway planks were not pulled back until 7:20.  This was mentioned in the ships long court trial but said trial is a general mess so its easily misheard.  Still it makes following the timeline a bit harder and that is a pain.\n\nThere's also an unfortunate angle thats used in one chapter that has led to the Eastland being used as a crudel by libertarians.  Let me explain. One major cause of the disaster is that lifeboats were added to the ship after the Titanic due to Congress passing the Seamens Act of 1915.  This bill made it that all ships operating under US law had to have lifeboats for all lives.  This meant the ship was now far heavier.  It definitely contributed to the sinking, and some people including Bonansinga has labeled the policy \"an example of political correctness\".  This has led some naval libertarians to use the Eastland as a reason government regulation is bad.  \n\nWell the problem with that argument is that countless nations passed similars laws post 1912 and yet the Eastland is the only major shio disaster cited as being caused by it.  Its because one, the Eastland was a terribly designed ship for about 20 reasons and this was more a last kick into the grave, and the US law made it that all ships had to make changes, compared to say Britain, which was all ships made post 1912.  Its very infuriating to see 844 deaths used to say don't regulation pollution, and I wish the author hadn't said the Seamens Act was political correctness.  It did good things include raise minimum pay and even made it harder to arrest a sailor for protesting or going on strike.  \n\nLastly there's some general issues with material becoming outdated.  George W Hiltons book and is conclusion on the Titanic causing Eastland is hardly discredited.  But other theories have risen that disagree with it.  Such as the 2015 book Ashes Under Water which puts more blame on company corruption and lack of safety features and less a government law.  I find the book okay and the argument less then persuasive beyond making it clear multiple factors are at fault, but I know plenty of people trust it more then the Hilton book so its worth noting.\n\nSo... there's some dents in my favorite book and some to an extent that I recommend reading other books alongside it.  Does this mean I'm gonna email Jay Bonansinga with a list of corrections and complaints?  No, he's not a historian and I'm be an asshole.  Am I gonna burn the book or recommend it less?  No, hell I'm fine with people still using it as a major source of information.  \n\nOver the past few months, Ask a Mortician and Part Time Explorer have made documentaries on the Eastland and both quote Sinking of the Eastland, Ask a Mortician I think used it as her primary source even.  Jay Bonansinga appears and his work is quoted in the 2019 documentary Eastland: Chicago's Deadliest Day and its the best documentary on the subject far as I care.\n\nI just think its best to not be dogmatic when it comes to books.  I at first assumed everyone was wrong, because of how much I trusted this book.  I was naïve, nobody is 100 percent accurate.  Hell I've made some embarrassing errors.  Just, when writing or researching, always double check primary sources, citations, or other historians.  Mistakes are much like life, inevitable, but it can be temporary.\n\nSources.\n\nThe Sinking of the Eastland: Americas Forgotten Tragedy, Jay Bonansinga.\n\nEastland: Chicagos Deadliest Day, Moshman Productions.\n\nEastland: Legacy of the Titanic, George W Hilton.\n\nAshes Under Water: Eastland and the Shipwreck that Shook America, Michael McCarthy. \n\nThe Eastland Disaster Historical Society and specifically Todd Wackholz\n\nNewspaper.com for the Tribune and New York Times papers.\n\nPostsinthegraveyard and Findagrave for burial information.",

        "author": "Uptons_BJs",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/yy5trb/the_1973_fuel_crisis_and_corporate_average_fuel/",
        "text": "There's a very persistent myth that the 1973 fuel crisis and the subsequent introduction of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) killed off high horsepower cars. This myth is very widely believed, even by reputable sources. For instance, today Jason Cammisa (perhaps my favorite automotive pundit) released a video that repeated this myth:  [The Pontiac Fiero was A 50-mpg Con Job - Full History - Jason Cammisa's Revelations Ep. 27 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHmoiS6QeY) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe myth is repeated around 1:30, and essentially, the misconception goes like this: In the 60s, muscle cars made a ton of power, but by the late 70s, performance cars made half the power they did in the 60s. What happened in the early 70s? The fuel crisis of course! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the surface, this does make sense. After all, consider this:\n\nIn 1969, you had three V8 options for the Chevrolet Camaro - The 350 made 300hp, the 396 made 375 hp, and finally you had the special edition [COPO 427 that made 430 hp](https://www.motortrend.com/features/sucs-0707-1969-chevrolet-camaro-zl1/). By 1974, the highest performance option [was a Z28 that made 245 hp](https://www.ss396.com/cars/1974-Camaro/). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the surface, it seems reasonable to blame the fuel crisis for the death of performance cars - Before the fuel crisis, cars were making a ton more power. After the fuel crisis, cars became anemic and slow. And yes, it is true, the fuel crisis left a massive, lasting impact on the automotive landscape forever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, despite the massive impact the fuel crisis had on the automotive industry, it was not why high horsepower cars practically disappeared for a few decades. The real culprit for the death of the muscle car is the introduction of SAE net, and the EPA's clean air act. Let's take a closer look at the history here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SAE Net vs SAE Gross - Or why the 60s muscle cars were never as powerful as they claimed to be**\n\nin the 1960s, cars were tested using a standard called SAE Gross horsepower. Defined by SAE standards J245 and J1995, the SAE Gross testing procedure was very simple. The engine was strapped to a dyno was nothing attached. There were no accessories attached, and the manufacturer was free to figure out how to handle fueling, exhaust, and cooling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSAE Gross numbers were essentially quite inflated. With no exhaust, unlimited air intake, and no accessories, engines made a ton more power on the dyno than they would in an actual car. But those numbers looked really good, and thus the quoted horsepower numbers were all SAE Gross horsepower. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe SAE thus updated their standard to a new standard called SAE Net horsepower - Defined by SAE J1349. The big difference between Net and Gross is that Net horsepower required the engine to be dynoed with the real air intake, exhaust, and all the engine driven accessories like the alternator and hydraulic pumps connected. Net output is essentially the actual engine output as installed in the car. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe industry agreed to make net horsepower mandatory for the 1973 model year, but most manufacturers rolled them out by 1972. To illustrate the difference, you can look at the quoted numbers of 1971 cars, since in 1971, some manufacturers quoted both net and gross horsepower. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Look at this 1971 Chrysler Hemi brochure.](https://i0.wp.com/www.curbsideclassic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Plymouth-1971-engines-hp-a.jpg) As you can see, every single engine configuration made significantly less net horsepower than gross horsepower. The 383 V8 with the single air cleaner and single exhaust had the biggest difference, it made 275 gross and 190 net horsepower. This is because gross horsepower didn't account for the restrictive air cleaner and exhaust. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what does this mean? Essentially, 60s were measured using a different methodology than 70s cars. And if you a 1960s car with the same methodology that was used in later vehicles, it would produce significantly less horsepower. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Clean Air Act, Catalytic Converters, and the loss of leaded gasoline.**\n\nThe clean air act of 1970 gave the EPA the mandate to control pollution and the authority to set emissions standards. The clean air act was very aggressive and ambitious - It mandated a 90% reduction in emissions by 1975. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the passage of the clean air act the EPA started moving immediately and in 1972 demanded that all gas stations must offer unleaded gasoline by 1974. The EPA required catalytic converters by 1975.  However, catalytic converters are not compatible with leaded gasoline, hence the requirement that all gas stations must offer unleaded gasoline by 1974.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the introduction of the Clean Air Act in 1970, automakers started phasing out cars that required leaded gasoline. GM was the first major automaker to phase out leaded gasoline - The majority of 1971 model year GM vehicles could run fine on unleaded gasoline, and the last few models supported unleaded gasoline by 1972. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdding lead to gasoline increased the octane of gasoline, giving it much higher knock resistance. The transition to unleaded gasoline meant that automakers had to reduce the compression ratios of their engines. For example, in 1971 Chevrolet reduced the compression ratio of their popular LT-1 engine from 11:1 down to 9:1. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the mid 70s, cars started getting catalytic converters, and early catalytic converters were quite restrictive. This further sapped power and generally late 70s cars typically had the lower power and worst drivability. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Putting it all together by tracing the decline of the C3 Chevrolet Corvette.** \n\nConsider Chevrolet's C3 Corvette. Originally introduced in 1968, it was Chevrolet's flagship sports car. Thanks to the folks at GM Heritage, and the big collector community, we can track the decline of the car over the years pretty clearly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1970, the Corvette got the famous LT1 small block engine. At 350Ci or 5.7 liters, the LT1 made a quoted 370 gross horsepower with an 11:1 compression ratio. For 1971, the LT1 engine saw its compression ratio drop to 9:1 to accommodate unleaded gasoline, and thus horsepower went down accordingly to 330 (gross).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1972 marked the last year of Chevrolet's original LT1 (Chevrolet would reuse the LT1 name 3 times), and for 1972, it was advertised to make 255 hp. This decline was explained by Chevrolet's switch from gross to net horsepower. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor 1973, Chevrolet discontinued the LT1 engine, replacing it with the L82 engine that made 250hp, and the L82 remained more or less unchanged in the C3 Corvette for 1974. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nin 1975, the L82 suffered another 45hp drop to 205hp, due to the introduction of a catalytic converter. As bad as it seemed, in 1976 Car and Driver tested the Corvette against its domestic rivals from Dodge, Pontiac and Ford, and the [Corvette was still the fastest American car on sale](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparison-test/a15142552/chevy-corvette-vs-dodge-dart-pontiac-firebird-chevy-silverado-ford-mustang-archived-comparison-test/). With a 124.5 miles per hour trap speed in the quarter mile, Car and Driver noted that to get an import as fast as a Corvette, one had to pay an extra $5000.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why was it not the Fuel Crisis that killed off the muscle car?**\n\nThe 1973 fuel crisis was a direct result of OAPEC's embargo that began after the Yom Kippur war. The war began on October 6 and ended October 25. Corporate Average Fuel Economy was actually signed into law in 1975, to begin kicking in in 1978. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we look at the history of performance cars, the drop in advertised horsepower occurred in 3 stages:\n\n1. Horsepower dropped as compression ratios went down in 71-72. This was done so that engines could run unleaded gasoline.\n2. Quoted horsepower went down in 72-73 as manufacturers switched from quoting gross to net horsepower (note: this did not change actual power, just quoted numbers)\n3. Although catalytic converters were first introduced in 1975, it was not a response to the energy crisis. Instead, the EPA announced the requirement in 1972.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, the first two drops occurred before the fuel crisis, and the third drop was due to a decision made before the fuel crisis. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I have three more arguments against the idea that it was CAFE and the fuel crisis that killed off the high horsepower performance car:\n\n1. A big reason why power went down was compression ratios going down. Higher compression ratio engines are actually more thermodynamically efficient. If there was no Clean Air Act and phase out of leaded gasoline, why would automakers drop compression ratios as a response to high fuel prices? Lower compression ratios are less efficient!\n2. High-performance, high-priced cars are typically purchased by wealthy individuals who didn't drive them that much. You'd think they would not be too sensitive to fuel prices, but the [mighty Ferrari 308 made a pathetic 205 hp in US spec,](https://www.ultimatespecs.com/car-specs/Ferrari/131821/Ferrari-308-GTS-US-market.html) and the Mercedes 450 SL made an anemic 180hp. \n3. Europeans faced the same high fuel costs and energy crisis Americans did. But the Europeans didn't have to face the same emissions laws Americans faced. From the 70s to the 90s routinely the same car made more power in European spec than they did in US spec. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n [How Many “Real” Horsepower Did The 1971 426 Hemi Really Make?

        "text": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hr9TUcWcoYY\n\nPretty much right from the start of the video TIK starts his usual nonsense about the masses being “tricked” into believing what socialism means and he is the savior of the world who is telling everyone what it really means. Also, he attempts to gaslight viewers by talking about what a society, a state, a government, etc, are, in order to confuse people and for them to question themselves. He’s a plonker. His basic argument is that the Nazis were socialists because socialism means the state owning the means of production. Has he never heard of state capitalism? Also, socialism can also mean when the workers own the means of production. \n\nThe Nazis weren’t socialists, despite TIK’s definitions of such and such.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/story/were-the-nazis-socialists\n\nAs Richard J. Evans points out, “It Would Be Wrong to See Nazism as a Form of, or an Outgrowth From, Socialism.”\n\nAnd, Ian Kershaw goes into further detail:\n\n“Hitler was wholly ignorant of any formal understanding of the principles of economics. For him, as he stated to the industrialists, economics was of secondary importance, entirely subordinated to politics. His crude social-Darwinism dictated his approach to the economy, as it did his entire political \"world-view.\" Since struggle among nations would be decisive for future survival, Germany's economy had to be subordinated to the preparation, then carrying out, of this struggle. This meant that liberal ideas of economic competition had to be replaced by the subjection of the economy to the dictates of the national interest. Similarly, any \"socialist\" ideas in the Nazi programme had to follow the same dictates. Hitler was never a socialist. But although he upheld private property, individual entrepreneurship, and economic competition, and disapproved of trade unions and workers' interference in the freedom of owners and managers to run their concerns, the state, not the market, would determine the shape of economic development. Capitalism was, therefore, left in place. But in operation it was turned into an adjunct of the state.”\n\nhttps://www.snopes.com/news/2017/09/05/were-nazis-socialists/\n\nFULL FACT followed up the claim and found that it was not true. \n\nhttps://fullfact.org/online/nazis-socialists/\n\nSo at the end of the day the only thing TIK has in his defense is propagating the conspiracy theory known as Cultural Marxism and that is that academics, scholars and historians since 1945 have been filing the masses of people and hiding the alleged truth from them. He’s a total crank and it’s so easy to see right through him.",

I'm particularly interested in the way it treats rebellions against Columbus's rule not as revolts against his tyranny, but as ungrateful colonists unsatisfied with their lot (and who conspired against him in part because of his foreign background).",

I've seen swaths of bad history about how Islam is some sort of big evil that wants to consume everything in its path and wants to wipe out all Non-Muslims. Now a lot of you are probably aware of how wrong this idea is, but I'm just going to give a quick rundown.\n\nThis idea that Islam was spread by the sword is basically just a result if the West's lack of understanding of Islamic conquest tactics and realities. A lot of the place that the Muslims conquered actually flipped willingly on a local level. The Muslims in return offered them religious freedom and a lack of persecution. Muhammad himself wrote a treat with the town of Najran protecting their religion. This policy would be used all over the Empire. So this idea that Islam tried to wipe out Christianity and Judaism is unfounded. This can also be seen in treaties with Monasteries and towns all over the empire. They even deposed the Byzantine appointed Bishop Cyrus, and brought back the old patriarch Benjamin of Alexandria. Also, later dynasties would continue to honor these treaties. Many of these groups would rather flip and pay slightly more tax than to be actively persecuted by the Byzantines.\n\nAnother myth I have seen is this idea that in Islam politics and religion is completely intertwined in the Caliphate. Yes this is 100% true in the beginning, but like any good religion, the leaders later get political. A good example of this is the Umayyaid Caliphs. Mu'awiya I deposed Ali, best friend of the prophet and seized the Caliphate and then had all of the leaders swear fealty to his son while he was still alive, turning the caliphate into a kingship. He also moved power away from Mecca and Medina to Damascus, a city with no religious signifigance. And his son Yazid would take this even further. He would kill Husayn, Grandson of Muhammad himself, and would then lay seige to Mecca. He wouldn't even be the last Umayyaid to do that. Abd Al-Malik did the exact same thing. He also centralized the power in Damascus, formed a currency, and made Arabic the official language. In short, the caliphs ceased to be fully religious authorities and the Caliphate devolved into a normal empire.\n\ntl;dr Islam has not always wanted a theocracy and is not a group that seeks to wipe out all other religions. This idea of Islam is modern and is based off of Islamism, a modern idea based off of a rose-tinted glasses idea of the caliphate.\n\nSources:\nThe History of al-Tabari- al-Tabari\nThe Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates - Hugh Kennedy\nThe Treaty of Najran\nThe Origins of the Islamic State- al-Baladhuri\nUniversity Lectures",

I used as an example most of them were fundamentalist/evangelical Christians and that region is called the Bible Belt for a reason.\n\nHis response was: \n(to paraphrase) \"The term Bible Belt is a relatively new term to describe the South.  It only came around in the 80's and 90's.  The South was actually one of the most secular parts of the country during the Jim Crow era.  \n\nAs for the churches in the south, the Southern Baptists were much more liberal.  They preached the social gospel and were adamantly against Capitalism, the Vietnam War, and they also were early supporters of Gay Rights.  They also preached segregation, which is what most liberal churches taught at the time.\n\nHowever, when Pastors in the South started reading the Bible closer, they realized segregation was not in the Bible and started moving to traditional Judeo-Christian values.  The Southern Baptists churches revolted and pushed out the liberal leadership, replacing them with Evangelical Christians.  Then became Republican shortly after that.\"\n\n(End Paraphrase)\n\nPersonally, I am not saying race was the main reason Southerners changed parties, but this is by far one the worst explanations I have heard.  I'm not sure where he's getting this from.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  Is there any accuracy to this?",

Anyone want to give it a shot?\n\nAs a sidenote, what possible motivation could you have to be a Columbus apologist more than 500 years later?\n\nEDIT: This is a \"Request\" obviously, but I don't know how to get the flair on my post.\n\nEDIT 2: Some extra detail on the video. The guy spends the first half trying to convince us that Columbus wasn't actually as stupid as videos like \"Adam Ruins Everything- Christopher Columbus Was a Murderous Moron\" would have us believe. This has nothing to do with whether Columbus was evil but I guess he decided it was worth devoting the first half of the video to. Not sure how accurate his claims are. \n\nThe second half of the video is focused on trying to show that Columbus wasn't as bad as people have said (though he still admits Columbus was a bad guy by modern standards, but still better than some of his contemporaries). He uses Google Translate several times in an attempt to show that the translations usually used for Columbus's journal are uncharitable and translate it in the worst way. Using Google Translate for this purpose is absurd and proves literally nothing, even without being a historian I can easily see that those parts of the video are just a waste of time. \n\nBasically his claims are that Columbus didn't want to enslave the native people and only wanted to make them Christians, and that his brutal punishments (cutting off hands and noses) were done to the Spanish colonists rather than to the Taino people, and that Columbus was actually critical of the colonists using under-aged Taino girls as sex slaves rather than being a supporter of it. The guy's reasoning for this is that the people claiming Columbus was bad were taking quotations out of context, and from a bad translation. He does cite sources for everything, but I have no idea how cherry-picked or misrepresented those sources are. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone can weigh in on that.\n\n(Oh an he also claims that Columbus's actions were not genocide due to lack of intent and justifies this by going off on a tangent about the Trayvon Martin verdict that would probably violate rule 2 to talk about.)",

        "author": "Gsonderling",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9i0eo1/ars_technica_explores_new_evidence_in_galileo/",
        "text": "Ars Technica just published an article about new letter, written by Galileo, and the light it shines upon the famous affair.\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/historians-find-long-lost-galileo-letter-hiding-in-plain-site-at-royal-society/\n\nWhile the article details the process behind finding, and identification, of the letter pretty well. It manages to make some rather astounding errors, in context of the affair, nomenclature and history of science.\n\nThe last being especially strange, since Ars is a tech oriented website/forum, the one place where one would expect familiarity with history of scientific theories.\n\nYeah, it is a low hanging fruit, but I think that website reporting on scientific/technical matters shouldn't make mistakes like this. Especially since there are so many sources available.\nBut let's dig in.\n\nFirst some of the classical blunders most people make, when talking about the subject.\n\n&gt;He argued in favor of the Earth moving around the Sun, rather than vice versa, in direct contradiction to church teachings at the time.\n\nAnd in a direct contradiction to prevailing scientific consensus at the time. While most european scientists of the time were priests (including Copernicus), the science they did was still solid. For the time at least. The fact that they were ordained didn't make them stupid, or their arguments irrelevant.\n\nGalileo's model, while valid in retrospect, was seriously lacking in evidence. It explained all the phenomena that simpler existing model did, and required observations and theoretical apparatus that were not yet available, and wouldn't be available for centuries (Stellar Paralax, irregularity of orbits, laws of motion). \n\nTo put it in simple terms, Galileo was only right in hindsight, at the time there was very little supporting his case.\n\n&gt;A set of nested spheres (called \"epicycles\") surrounded the Earth, each an orbit for a planet, the Sun, the moon, or the stars.\n\nThe spheres of Ptolemaic model were not called epicycles, as the writer of article on the matter should know. They were called deferents, the smaller spheres, hinged on the deferents, were called epicycles. These epicycles explained retrograde motion of celestial bodies and eventually irregularity of their orbits. This is a minor nitpick, but it shows that writers understanding of the model is rather lacking.\n\n\n&gt;Everyone loved the Ptolemaic model, even if it proved an imperfect calendar.\n\nYou can say that about any pre-modern model of solar system. And for plenty of those that came after. Making calendar \"perfect\" is not exactly easy task. That's why we have leap years. The writer implies that Ptolemaic model was unique in this regard, and only picked because:\n\n&gt; The aesthetics meshed nicely with the prevailing Christian theology of that era. Everything on Earth below the moon was tainted by original sin, while the celestial epicycles above the moon were pure and holy, filled with a divine “music of the spheres.” \n\nWhich is just wrong. It was prevailing model because it worked, and because there was lack of serious alternative. Meaning, there was no model that solved all the same problems, while also solving the existing ones. Or at least there is no evidence of it. Despite what the film Agora tries to tell us.\n\n\n&gt; Everything changed in the mid-16th century, when Nicolaus Copernicus published De Revolutionibus, calling for a radical new cosmological model that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, with the other planets orbiting around it. His calculations nailed the order of the six known planets at the time,\n\nNot much changed, since it didn't really make much impact. Calculating motion of existing planets wasn't something new either. It was done regularly by astrologists and calendar makers of the time. \n\n&gt; and he correctly concluded that it was the Earth's rotation that accounted for the changing positions of the stars at night.\n\nWe know that in hindsight, but at the time there was no reason to prefer his explanation, over the classical one (the final celestial sphere holding stars).\n\n&gt;claims were \"just a theory\"—an argument all too familiar today with regard to evolution and creationism.\n\nJust a hypothesis would be more accurate, and at the time it was an accurate statement. Considering the known evidence and the predictive ability of individual models. Equating the opposition to evolution with early modern opposition to heliocentric system is either dishonest or ignorant. \n\n\n&gt;Then Galileo came along with his handy telescope (a recent invention) and his observations clearly supported the Copernican worldview. The church started taking notice, because Galileo openly espoused the Copernican system, in his papers and his personal correspondence.\n\nNo, the Church started to take notice because Galileo had habit of making enemies. And because of the way he behaved towards his one time patron, Urban VIII.\n\n&gt;The Catholic Church had had enough and Galileo found himself facing the Inquisition, forced to his knees to officially renounce his \"belief\" in the Copernican worldview.\n\nThe Pope had enough. You see, Urban VIII was rather favorably disposed towards GG. So when Galileo wrote book about cosmology, the famous *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems*, Urban asked for his own arguments to be included. Arguments in favor of geocentrism.\n\nUnfortunately, Galileo used character of Simplicio, or idiot, as a defender of geocentric model. And to matter even worse, he made the character really, really stupid. To the point that Simplicio deliberately avoided arguments that could have helped his position. \n\nSo instead of polemic, the book was basically an attack, not just on the geocentrism, but on Pope himself.\n\nNot a wise move, while religious turmoil tears Europe apart and Papa authority is being questioned.\n\nThe book became rather popular, and despite receiving approval from the Church (specifically the inquisition), it pretty much ended Galileos career.\n\n\nI'm going to leave last paragraph of the article without response, as I think it clearly illustrates the bias and overall tone of the article.\n\n&gt;Should we conclude from this that Galileo was not the scientific hero we've long thought him to be? Surely not. The changes are minor, mostly regarding his statements about the bible, not his scientific analysis. It's difficult for us to conceive just how dangerous a time the 16th century was for scientists and scholars who dared to cross the Catholic Church. Galileo was fortunate not to have been burned at the stake for his claims; thousands of less fortunate people around the world were executed for heresy over the centuries that the Inquisition existed. Who could begrudge him those last nine years of relative quiet and contemplation? This merely shows the complicated man behind the heroic stereotype—one with sufficient diplomatic skill to soften his words without diluting his science.\n\n\n\nSources:\n* Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\n\n* The Galileo Affair: A Documentary History by Maurice Finocchiaro\n\n* History for Atheists a blog by Tim O'Neill\n\n* Britannica: articles on Ptolemaic system/Geocentric systems in general.\n",

        "text": "I was inspired to post the following in /r/Australia to try to give some level of dispassionate foundation for the crazy fights that occur in a factual vacuum in this country over, not only James Cook's legacy but even who he was or what he did.\n\nEdit: Update on the r/australia situation: Although it's not clear which, it appears one if the mods banned me for the below post. So controversial is Cook history there that any mention is deemed drama\nand not to be discussed. The mods there have refused to explain why exactly they've been on a campaign against this topic but there we are. A talking point in and of itself, I think.\n\nCommon claims by the right such as: \"The left is rewriting history by saying Cook didn't discover Australia\" or the left wing claim that Cook, assisted by eugenics enthusiast Joseph Banks, slaughtered indigenous tribes and conquered the continent, for example. He's somehow become a controversial figure for millions of people but almost no one's rhetoric seems to align with reality.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/australia/comments/9hdc23/captain_cooks_journal_april_19_1770_the_endeavour/\n\nIt's not just the controversial repercussions of settlement at issue. Politicians and media will claim he discovered the continent (he didn't). That a house in Melbourne is where he was born (it isn't) or that he used the doctrine of terra nullius to claim possession for George III (he didn't).\n\nMy question for the historiography fans here at /r/badhistory is what the hell has happened here? \n\nWe seem to have found a particular niche in the history/culture war in Australia where neither side has any regard whatsoever for the basic facts of what happened. It's progressed so far that Cook appears, in the eyes of many Australians at least, to have become some bizarre Arthur Philip/Christopher Columbus hybrid.\n\nIs there precedent for an individual as well understood as Cook to become victim to such widespread misinformation, simultaneously, from opposing sides of the spectrum?\n\nThe /r/Australia post:\n\nApparently conflicting forces have joined in a confluence of extremely bad history over the events of the 12 to 16 weeks beyond this diary entry.\n\nI think, given some of the outright lies told by both history/culture warring parties, there might be some benefit in simply showing people where they can find the original words of Cook, Banks and senior officers on the Endeavour without anyone's political or philosophical agenda trying to colour them. \n\nThere's a lot of really strongly held thoughts on this time period but it can absolutely never hurt to have a look at the primary sources we have easy to hand and Australia's National Library site is a real Aladdin's Cave. So I hope some of you find this interesting reading no matter where you sit on the spectrum (there's some pretty interesting episodes in the voyage before this too, such as Cook's falling out with the Viceroy of Rio De Janeiro who seems to suspect the little Bark Endeavour could never really be on the mission Cook describes). \n\nCook's own words also put the lie to the claim he never lashed a sailor... and they seem to support the no scurvy claims. There's even a run in with the Great Barrier Reef and an Aboriginal warrior with a remarkable and unexplained bow and quiver full of arrows. \n\nMore: Joseph Banks diary: http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/banks/17700819.html\n\nHawkesbury's account: http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/banks/17700819.html\n\nParkinson's account: http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/parkinson/198.html\n\nOf particular note are the days following these as well as the August 22 entry from Cook in which he takes possession of the east coast in keeping with his orders to do so from the King. \n\nPossession Island: http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700822.html\n\nThis one is particular important in the culture wars because, despite the left's claim otherwise Cook does not use the words \"terra nullius\". This concept becomes important about 18 years later with the landing of Arthur Philip. \n\nThe August 22 entry also cripples the right wing culture warrior whinge of \"re-writing history\" by claiming Cook did not discover Australia as Cook himself says as much in his own words here too.\n\nAnd, although this isn't a primary source, it is quite contemporaneous and sober. Here's a really handy explanation of where Mabo enters history and how Cook does (or completely doesn't as it it may more accurately be characterised) have anything at all to do with the doctrine if terra nullius and how it all fits together. \n\nRewriting History 1: The Mabo Decision, by Mark Gregory: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AltLawJl/1992/73.pdf\n\nEdt",

        "text": " So in run-up to Odyssey, I started this series looking at all the AC games from a historical perspective. I made a series of Reddit Posts on it.\n\nI am now putting an index of all the posts in one place for accessibility. I started the series with Unity before going back chronologically except for when I did Rogue before Black Flag that is. But I am arranging it here chronologically.\n\n1.

[Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9gr4m6/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_all/)\n\nI have focused on main console releases, no minor games, very little DLC, no transmedia, no movie. I have focused on the casual experience of these games. I also think that doing the main games allows me to say something about 3D Open World Game design and AAA titles in general because a lot of the decisions and choices on what to take/keep from history reflects issues about mass media and so on. What redeems AC is the whole idea of doing these games on such a big AAA scale, large 3D open world maps, cutscenes with historical characters voiced and rendered and so on. A lot of what makes these games work is stuff that only works in the gaming medium and specifically in 3D. So I think this is about bigger stuff than a single game.\n\nThey are all long posts. **The TL;DR** in terms of common themes:\n\n\\- More diversity in New World Games (AC3, Black Flag, Rogue) than in any of the European games and the ones set in the Middle East and North Africa (AC1, Origins)\n\n\\- A tendency towards sanitizing which happens even when it is being subversive.\n\n\\- Inspired more by old familiar movies, TV shows, and other adaptations than going back to scratch.",

[Syndicate](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9gey6c/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/). Now here we are. All caught up with Origins. The tenth major release of Assassin's Creed, and released in 2017, the ten year anniversary of the franchise. \n\nAs a game, ***ORIGINS*** **presents a lot of challenges.** One is this game is set in the Antiquity, the first AC game to go way back to the Pre-Crusades era. Then there is the size of ORIGINS, which is incredibly big, a recreation of a big swathe of Cleopatra' Egypt. There is also the volume of game content here on offer which is extensive and daunting. **Ubisoft released the excellent Discovery Tour which substitutes for their database and maps out events and stuff** on to terrain in an unique way. **The game consulted a lot of Egyptologists for its recreation of the pyramids** **and managed** [**to get ahead of a real-life archaeological discovery based on the theories of one of their consultants**](https://kotaku.com/this-week-s-giza-pyramid-discovery-was-already-built-in-1820130886)**.** The game has a huge number of side-quests and missions but most of them are errands of one kind or another, grounded however with a thematic unity with the main game's story. This makes them consistent and feel substantial but also repetitive and there's rarely an exploration of the world in a larger scope. **As such I am mainly going to talk about the main campaign from beginning to end, while discussing side missions only in part.**\n\n***Setting:*** Ptolemaic Egypt in the reign of Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator overlapping with the final leg of Caesar's Civil War and his dictatorship.\n\n***MAIN CAMPAIGN***\n\nBayek is a Medjay, an ancient office in the Pharaonic age. **Bayek blames the Ptolemies for the end of the Medjay** **but in fact it collapsed before Egypt's first foreign occupation by the Persians,** who preceded Alexander. As such, **Bayek's story has more fiction than history but we still have historical figures** among the Proto-Templars, **Lucius Septimus, the real-life Gabiniani Roman** who killed Pompey Magnus, and **Pothinus,** the Royal Eunuch who was main henchman and minder of Ptolemy XIII. **Among the Proto-Assassins, we have Pasherienptah III**, an obscure priest of Memphis who is fictionalized here, and of course we have **Marcus Junius Brutus**, and Cassius among Aya's Roman recruits who show up at the end of the game. **Other historical figures we see are**: Ptolemy XIII, Cleopatra VII, Julius Caesar, Pompey Magnus, Apollodorous the Sicilian, Marcus Vitruvius.\n\nThe **main story of Origins is entirely about Bayek's religious quest** to ensure that his son Khemu finds peace in the afterlife, the Field of Reeds, that his death as a result of the Proto-Templars is avenged. His son's name, as is clear in the last Siwa Quest (\"Bayek's Promise\") is based on Kemet, the Hieroglyphic word the natives used to call their land, as opposed to Egypt, the Greek word based on a transliteration of the Temple of Ptah in Memphis. There's a joke waiting to be written about how we use the Greek Word for Egypt (Kemet) and the Latin word for Greece (Hellas). Most of *Origins* because of its religious and spiritual dimension for Bayek, and his personal grief, so we see repeatedly Bayek doing missions for Temple Priests, fighting corrupt priests and so on. **Bayek's religious devotion, as an Egyptian polytheist, also brings him in conflict with Aya, his half-Greek wife** who is way more keyed into the political side of stuff, and who is more like a traditional Assassin protagonist for better and worse. And **Aya is the one who gets Bayek involved in the Civil War between Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra VII**, backing the latter and helping her come to power. Of these characters, very little is known about Apollodorous, Lucius Septimus and so on. So the game's take on them has the artistic license it needs.\n\n**The historical plot begins** **when Bayek comes to Alexandria, and meets Cleopatra** in the mission \"Egypt's Medjay\". Cleopatra is **one of the most speculated among historical figures** because even if she comes from a period from which we have a lot of written sources (the First Century BCE), **nearly everything that we know of her comes** decades later, and much of it comes **from the propaganda put forth by Augustus** in his Civil War against Antony. That propaganda **depending on how you see it either demonized her, or exaggerated her** as more important than she likely deserved to be. In any case, recent biographers note that she was pretty young when she contested her Brother-Husband Ptolemy XIII to rule as Pharoah. **The game's Cleopatra is not as young as she was, which was around 18-19 at the time she began her famous visit to the South to gain support from Egypt's traditional elite.** She is also shown as this slutty vamp who comes on to Bayek and wears seductive dresses and so on, and is basically some Ptolemaic Lindsay Lohan. In actual fact, biographers like Stacy Schiff and Adrian Goldsworthy argue that it's highly likely she was a virgin when she met Caesar, and that it was Caesar who deflowered her. **So this Cleopatra is more or less a redux of Caterina Sforza from AC2 in all matters**. The game also follows recent tradition in focusing on Ptolemy XIII as her only rival. In actual fact the Alexandrine Civil War was a four-sided civil war with Cleopatra fighting Ptolemy XIII, another brother called Ptolemy, and her sister Arsinoe (sent to Rome as part of Caesar's triumph, but who the Roman mob so pitied that Caesar spared her and then had her live as a hostage. After his death, years later Antony executed her, likely on Cleopatra's orders). **Cleopatra's appearance has an entire cottage industry** dedicated to how beautiful she was or wasn't, with again everything depending on how much we can rely on Roman standards of beauty and whether it's consistent with Western norms today. Some posthumous mural has her with Red Hair and she was part of a dynasty of Macedonian inbred brother-sister marriages. But on the other hand, [there's that report about her sister Arsinoe's tomb having African ancestry](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/also_in_the_news/7945333.stm). In either case it doesn't matter, because **Origins' Cleopatra looks almost exactly like her design from Asterix comics.**\n\n**The bigger issue for me at least is her accent.** In *Origins*, the developers took the decision to have Egyptians or Egyptian-Greeks talk with an accented English, while Ptolemaics and Romans talk like British, just like the Old Hollywood Ancient Epics. The problem is that one of the few widely known facts about Cleopatra is that she was the only one of her dynasty who learned the native Egyptian language, and indeed knew many languages including Hebrew and others. In the game we see Cleopatra speak in this accented English, when she should ideally sound like Bayek and Aya, or at least less like the other Ptolemaic-Romans. I personally think this could have been done if they used American accents which has more variety and diversity than British accents do, and it's one of those affectations, similar to UNITY's Napoleon the Corsican's English accent sounding like every other Parisien's, that for the sake of entertainment ends up communicating a distorted view.\n\n**Then we meet Pompeius Magnus on sea in Aya's first naval mission**. This mission has Cleopatra secretly sending Aya as her agent to meet Pompey to get his support before Ptolemy XIII's. There's no record of Cleopatra seeking Pompey's alliance before Caesar. Their paths did cross when Pompey in his Conqueror of the East phase sent the Gabinus and other Roman soldiers to intervene in Egypt thus leading to the Gabiniani (as they ended up being known) settling there and becoming partly Hellenized. But Cleopatra was a small child at that time. Pompey the Great looks like his sculpture but he looks too young, when he was noted for having lost a lot of his good looks at the time of his death. And politically it makes no sense to court Pompey's alliance now, because Pompey post-Pharsalia coming to Egypt was being chased by the guy who kicked his ass. And it was fear of Caesar that led to his death at the orders of Ptolemy XIII and Pothinus.\n\n**The next historical mission is Cleopatra's meeting with Caesar** (\"Blade of the Goddess\") which is an extended long mission. This scene makes a number of distortions from the record. We see Bayek and Co. with Cleopatra going to Pompey's side and then finding his decapitated body on the beach, and then deciding to go to Alexandria, where Cleopatra was exiled from, and meet Caesar. The meeting, as in Plutarch, has her wrapped in carpet, but rather than have that meeting in private (hence the whole carpet thing) we have her unfurled in the room with Caesar and Ptolemy XIII. We also see at the start of this cutscene, **Caesar being presented Pompey's head and then shrugging it away. This is a huge distortion.** Every source and every fictional version shows Caesar being grieved at seeing Pompey, ex-triumvir and ex-son-in-law being executed and especially at the hands of the smelly barbarian Egyptian-Greeks. Caesar like all Romans believed that every Roman citizen, and especially Roman heroes like Pompey, were worth more than any foreigner, king or peasant. And **no rivalry towards Pompey would lead him to condone or shrugging away the execution of a Roman general at a foreign ruler's hands**. Caesar's appearance has him looking like a John Slattery-type with a full head of white hair, when he was known for being balding and having a receding hairline (his own soldiers at his Triumphal parade called him, with affection, \"the bald adulterer\"). We have this weird thing about **Caesar looking younger than recorded, and Cleopatra looking older, and I think the reasons why is to dial down the whole old-dude young-girl romance, again similar to Ezio and Caterina Sforza in AC2**. Caesar's personality and character in ORIGINS is a major disappointment. This is one of the most important men in history, the guy whose calendar design is still in effect, but instead **Caesar is shown as some clown, a puppet, and a bore.** When Goldsworthy pointed out that when Caesar came to Alexandria, he actually relaxed, started drinking and going on binges with his soldiers, and was actually on vacation mode during his romance with Cleopatra. We also have Caesar having true love for Cleopatra. In real-life, Caesar's will left Cleopatra nothing. She was in Rome as a valued guest during the time of his assassination. Caesar according to Goldsworthy may have been fond of her, but it's more likely he saw her as another conquest. Since a bit later he had an affair with another Princess at Pergamum and a womanizer like him was probably not one to cast his wagon with a military-weak ruler like Ptolemaic-Egypt.\n\nThen we have a very fast-forwarded portrayal of the Siege of Alexandria and the Nile. Aya lights a fire at the Pharos. Then in a repeat of Connor and Paul Revere, we have Bayek and Caesar on chariot. Which again, no way a Roman military commander like Caesar would allow. We also have Caesar mutter \"The die is cast\" the familiar translation of \"Alea jacta est\". In actual fact he quoted a Greek phrase from Menander, \"anerriphtho kybos\" which is actually closer to \"Let's roll the dice\". The difference in meaning is that \"The die is cast\" shows Caesar as being decisive and fatalistic, while \"Let's roll the dice\" shows him cautious, contingent, and improvising. Modern Caesar bios favor the second translation. Then we see Ptolemy XIII die in a cutscene, we see Caesar in a cutscene killing people like Jon Snow (which I feel we should have seen in the main game). We see Pothinus dying in a boss-fight when he was just executed by Caesar. Then **in the aftermath, we see Caesar sparing Lucius Septimus**, the Gabiniani who killed Khemu. Septimus was a real-life figure and he disappeared from history. **The Shaw Play** ***Caesar and Cleopatra*** **showed Caesar pardoning Septimus but there this was shown as an example of Caesar's famous clemency. Here this is shown as Caesar selling out and becoming a Templar**, and Cleopatra turning him with her dreams up about matching up to Alexander. All of this are cliches from Mankiewicz's *Cleopatra*.\n\n**The last historical mission and also the end of the game is the big one, the Ides of March, which the game gets wrong on multiple levels.** Before we see Brutus and Cassius in Egypt with Bayek and Aya. Neither of them were in Egypt at this time. Both were in Rome, and even then Brutus had a governorship in Gaul for a while. We see Aya plotting out Caesar's assassination and then she sails to Rome. She comes to the Roman Forum and the Theater of Pompey, which was used as a temporary location after the senate house got burnt down during Clodius Pulcher's cremation. So that's true. The Roman Forum of the Republican era is quite different from the ruins in Rome today. That was from Augustus' time and he leveled Republican architecture to create a new more imperial Rome. Also the Roman Forum should be huge and crowded whereas in Origins we see a military encampment. We see Caesar call a meeting at the Senate apparently to be asked to be made King. This is false on multiple levels. The Senate called Caesar. Caesar was planning to go to Parthia to avenge Crassus' death. We also see all the senate attacking Caesar, which is a common mistake, but actually some in the Senate tried to help to Caesar but couldn't get through. Others were panicked, such as Cicero. Others were afraid I guess. **Brutus before he stabs Caesar says they want \"land for the people\". \"Land for the People\" was Caesar's policy which Brutus and his entire faction, optimates, opposed.** Then Aya, disguised as a senator (which all things considered is the least ridiculous part), stabs Caesar, and then in post-cutscene she goes to Cleopatra. We see her with Caesarion who looks too old...he should be 3 years old. Aya says, \"the people call you dead tyrant's whore\" but Caesar was popular and beloved by the Roman people. He wasn't seen by them as tyrannical. Quite the opposite. And nobody called Cleopatra anything until decades later with Mark Antony. Then the campaign ends.\n\n***GENERAL OBSERVATIONS***\n\n\\- **ORIGINS has a major problem at its core.** Namely that **Bayek of Siwa's personal quest** as a grief-stricken father which is indeed touching, well-written, well-acted and well-animated, **doesn't fully fit the larger story** of Cleopatra's reign and downfall, the death of Caesar, and the establishment of the Proto-Assassin Cult. That actually fits Aya's story better. **Aya is the one who gets the missions doing the historical stuff** and she gets to kill Caesar (on which more later) **but it's obvious that Bayek is the main central character** since he gets the side-missions and as a native Egyptian Medjay, and a practicing polytheist **he's the one who better immerses us in the open world**.\n\n\\- **This problem** in the narrative's plot **is peculiarly a result of the game's historical accuracy** in showing the segregation of Ptolemaic Egypt. **Ptolemaic Egypt**, especially in Cleopatra's reign, **is often romanticized as a time of cultural hybridity**, where Greek culture synthesized with Ancient Egyptian culture. **A lot of this comes from Ptolemaic propaganda,** and the game's cutscenes often show and state this. What with Aya being part-Greek, and her marriage with Bayek as well as the Greek-Egyptian couple of Hotephres-Khenut in Faiyum Oasis. **The reality is that the Ptolemaic era was quite segregated** which indeed led some historians to, controversially, describe this era not as multi-culturalism but as an earlier form of *apartheid* where Greeks held all important positions in government, civic administration, military and cultural power, while Native Egyptians were never promoted to real positions of power and were left alone rather than oppressed and enslaved. There were separate law codes for Greeks and Egyptians and so on. **Order was maintained in Egypt over a small minority thanks to foreign powers** like the Persians, the Greeks, and then the Romans, **patronizing, suborning, and supporting the Egyptian priestly caste,** who encouraged the population to turn to religion and away from society. **We see this in** ***Origins*** **with Bayek's religious devotion** to the Egyptian pantheon **which creates a subtle tension in his marriage to Aya who is Part-Greek** and has a more skeptical and cynical attitude to religion. That scene where they talk at Alexander's tomb and offer contrasting opinions on that formidable asshole is quite insightful. **Within the game, Bayek has no curiosity over any other faith or set of gods other than that of Egypt, which does illustrate and correct the common idea that all pre-christian polytheism was syncretic and inclusionary**, when in fact that syncretism was exclusive to Roman society. Bayek's religious quest brings him in conflict with a few bad priests but it never has him interrogate the entire system which kept Egypt down, and **the political turn in Bayek's quest never really works as compared to his own internal story**.\n\n\\- In terms of historical recreation, the most important city in the game is Alexandria. **The Alexandria of this game is extremely small** compared to the real thing. The real Alexandria was divided into five quarters based on the first five letters of the Greek Alphabet: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon. It was a city organized on a grid. And **the city had a huge population for the ancient world**, more than 500,000 in Cleopatra's reign at a conservative estimate, a more generous one suggests a million and it certainly did see that in the later Roman era. **There should be as many NPCs here as we saw in UNITY,** instead we see a city that resembles the Medieval-Renaissance sandboxes of the Altair-Ezio games, or for that matter the Colonial settlements from the New World games. One of **the reasons why Alexandria, and Rome** (which had a population of a million in the same time) **fascinated people for so long, was that it would take more than a millennium for European cities of that scale to rise**. That was as much a real reason for the grandeur and myth that was attached to it as was the famous monuments, the Library, and the Lighthouse. **Alexandria also hosted at this time the largest Jewish community outside Judea,** and 2 out of 5 quarters had Jewish majorities. There were synagogues across the entire city. **Yet within this game we have one Synagogue** and some Hebrew-speaking NPCs **with no Jewish characters in the main game, the side-stories or even mentioned in the Discovery Tour**. Alexandrian Jews were major supporters and backers of Caesar when he took the city and settled in, and given the early bad reception he and Romans got (the mob pelted them according to Goldsworthy), they were obviously a swing vote group. Caesar who was popular with Jewish settlers in Rome, actually passed laws in their favour. In other words, Jews were essential and key parts of this story, and yet once again Ubisoft neglects them from a period in which they were central to. Alexandrian Jews under the Ptolemies translated the Tanakh from Hebrew into Greek, known today as the Septuagint, and many of them contributed to what we now call Gnosticism. Origins denied us a chance to glimpse Jewish life before their exile, diaspora, and persecution. Which is one of the main reasons why an Ancient World setting is so fascinating and important to us even today.\n\n\\- **ORIGINS gets Alexandria wrong, and if it got Alexandria wrong, I am wondering why they chose Ptolemaic Egypt rather than an earlier period**. As many historians point out Cleopatra's era is closer to us today than she is to the period of the Great Pyramids. Bayek's main religious quest and interests as a Medjay has nothing real attached to Cleopatra's reign both in terms of history, and in his own personal story quest, since Cleopatra's story is tied to his wife Aya, who very definitely doesn't share his religious inclinations (which again makes me wonder why they married). **Ideally Bayek's religious devotion to the traditional gods and his general conservatism would make him suited to the reign of Akhenaten**, and indeed the Curse of the Pharaohs DLC where he hunts down ghosts and phantoms of Akhenaten's court, including his wife Nefertiti and his son Tutankhamun, obviously embellished with fantasy hijinks and so on, actually gives him a more interesting character dynamic as someone who opposes the legacy of \"the heretic\" who tried to reverse Egypt's gods. Doing a religious conflict with entirely ancient and dead faiths (as opposed to the ones which still alive) would have been a more original story. **Most of Origins' sandbox and gameplay is tied to the deserts, the small settlements, the pyramids, the tombs, but the plot is entirely confined to palace politics to which Bayek has no affection, for either the cities or its rulers.** Fundamentally, Ptolemaic Cleopatra is not Ancient Egypt and its portrayal of Cleopatra as mentioned above is inaccurate and cliched, and sentimental. The lack of diversity and accuracy of detail in Alexandria makes it a failure of historical representation. **The only reason it seems to be here is because AC wanted a familiar and overexposed and so easily retold story about Caesar and Cleopatra with a handy set of cliches to regurgitate**. [AC's in-house historian Maxime Durand in this interview with Bob Whitaker](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/BobWhitaker/20171016/307596/Interview_with_Maxime_Durand_on_Assassins_Creed_Origins_and_Discovery_Tour_Mode.php) confessed that they wanted to do Republican Rome along with parts of Greece and Egypt. Which would be fine if it actually got something right about Roman politics, but as mentioned above it didn't. But more later.\n\n\\- **Following Ubisoft's 30-second rule, I checked up Siwa Oasis on wikipedia. Do you know what takes about six seconds to find?** [This paragraph on Siwa's native homosexual tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siwa_Oasis#Siwan_homosexual_tradition). **Siwa Oasis** according to historians and anthropologists **has a documented tradition of welcoming, tolerating, and celebrating homosexual unions between men** in the Islamic era which continued until the middle of the 20th Century when Nasser came to power. Some historians and anthropologists believe that this tradition could date back to antiquity, and represents a holdover or carryover from the Polytheistic era to the Christian and Islamic eras. **Instead, we get no mention of this**, no acknowledgement or hint of this anywhere. Not in Discovery Tour, not in side missions, and not the main quest. There is no mention of homosexuality within any of the main games, [and instead there is this utterly sleazy easter egg](http://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/orgy-assassins-creed-origins/). Bayek's relations within Siwa are all with women, Hepzefa, Aya, Kensa with no hint of him being gay or experimenting. **I suppose Ubisoft thinks, based on Odyssey and its Three Hundred digital cosplay, that the only boy-lovers were in Athens** and not in any part of the East, or so on. **This information is even there in Travel Guides** to Egypt, leave alone academic works (see sources below).\n\n\\- Likewise, not dealing with slavery in the Renaissance is bad enough, but not dealing or acknowledging its reality in the Ancient World is a new level of denial because virtually every fictional depiction of the ancient world deals with slavery. Now obviously many Egyptologists and native Egyptians get upset with \"the slaves built the pyramids thing\" and so on (which isn't entirely debunked but certainly qualified better now), and Egyptians seem to have favored freedmen more than Greece and Rome, but there was definitely slavery from the time the Macedonians and Ptolemaics arrived. Aya and Bayek talk a lot about freedom and I wonder why they don't deal with slavery.\n\n\\- **The most interesting thing in Origins is the attitude to children.** Historically, Rome and Greece practised infanticide, where deformed children or a kid that seemed weak would be dumped out, literally in garbage, which happened in the classical era of both civilizations. Children were also exposed to the elements, and exposed children were sold into slavery. According to Pomeroy and other historians, this practice was less common in Egypt of the same time. Infanticide wasn't practised as much, and exposed children were often picked up and nurtured and adopted as compared to Rome and Greece, where strangers would let them die. In *Origins*, we see Greek and Roman characters more callous about hurting and killing children, whether it's the Templar who kills Bayek's son, or the Greek woman Berenike who drowns Khadja or Cleopatra ordering the death of her annoying kid brother. **So in Bayek's attitude and nurturing feeling towards children, both his son, and others, we actually see a good accurate impression of Egypt's great positive virtue** which is worthy of praise and admiration. *Origins* has us see many children in the side missions and the main story, and it's rare to see an open-world game deal with that, leave alone something as violent and bloody as Origins.\n\n\\- **The title of** ***Origins*** **has gotten a lot of chuckles** from AC fans. The AC Lore has Proto-Assassins to the time of Ancient Greece. The game *Odyssey* announced a few months after launch only made it even more ridiculous. Ptolemaic Egypt in the time of Cleopatra isn't an origin so much as a curtain call, a finale, and a farewell. But **there is in on respect the title is apt, namely in that it shows us the original political assassination**, the model for many copycats and repeats\\*\\*.\\*\\* This brings me to my final point. what is after all **the fundamental element of Assassin's Creed, the fact that these games and its narratives repeatedly justifies and glorifies murder**, especially when the victims are heads of state, guilty, and tyrants, which is absurd because as I showed in my commentary on earlier games, the Assassins more often than not serve some tyrants and attack others. But **no story brings those issues as well as that of Julius Caesar's.**\n\n\\- The self-proclaimed Liberatores, Brutus and Cassius, who are numbered among the Assassins, weren't by any means good guys. **Brutus, as per fellow conservative Cicero, a corrupt loan shark who sent goons to beat up the poor to get back his money**. He and the Liberatores claimed to be restoring the Republic, but in practice they were acting like every other optimate faction who had murdered popular reformers from the time of the Gracchi. During his civil war with the 2nd Triumvirate, Brutus minted coins showing his face on it, which was illegal and against the norms, and following in the same vein as Pompey and Caesar. In other words, according to the historical view by Mary Beard and Adrian Goldsworthy, there is good reason to think Brutus would have been another warlord or dictator had he not lost and gotten \"martyred\" for liberty. And this is the kind of figure, AC has hitched to their wagon. Historically **every good treatment of Caesar's assassination that I know presents this as a tragic act**, steeped in horror at the violence, the betrayal by Caesar's closest friends, the act of murder happening in a hall of government. The fact that the assassination unleashed a spiral of civil war and led to the Empire. **Origins treats this as a tale of good senators versus evil Caesar and presents it as unambiguously heroic.** This action which inspired John Wilkes Booth to attack Lincoln thinking he was Brutus, as well as many other figures who justified other \"propaganda of the deed\" and which provided the model for Gavrilo Princip attacking the Archduke is reduced to a level below childish, because even small kids exposed to the Caesar story at a small age know that it's not to be celebrated. **The failure to reckon with the gravity and ambiguity of this crime, the lack of reflection at the horror of their culpability in the fallout, is a major failure of this game,** and ultimately it proves that Origins should not have been set in this Ptolemaic-Roman period since to the extent that the game deals with it, it fails.\n\n***CONCLUSION***\n\n\\- **Let me say that I like Origins and I like Bayek.** The Egypt of this game is unlike any other open-world setting and it looks amazing. The game shows the pyramids as they are now believed to have been, decorated, shiny, clean with caps at the top. This is probably the most accurate re-creation of the Ancient Pyramids than any pop-culture version of Egypt. The maps, the White Desert, the Black Desert and so on are amazing. I like getting heat-stroke by being in the desert and so on. **The main redeeming virtue is its positive portrayal of Egyptian polytheism** and sympathetic look at \"pagan\" worship since too often it's demonized in Christian works, and deprecated in secular works as either \"atheists-but-not-in-name\" or \"not-truly-important\". **Egyptian pantheon in particular is often demonized** as a source of Mummy curses as compared to Greek/Roman/Norse mythology **so Origins contributed positively by offering a counter-view**. That's leaving aside the moment when they cast white actors to play gods that is. I have no idea how accurate it is to Egyptian beliefs but Origins certainly gave me more insight into it than any other mainstream work.\n\nThe combat is obviously imported from Dark Souls, but it's still fitting because it feels like a sword-and-sandal peplum thing even if the combat tactics and maneuvers are very Hollywood. **However, I will say that the main story at least the historical part is a huge letdown, it doesn't connect to Bayek's story, which given that he belongs to an older period of Egypt, the game should have been set in the time when that culture was still alive and not subjugated by foreigners.** AC like many Western game companies have a hard time getting shareholders and marketers interested in real non-western settings, so whether it's AC1 and its choice on the minor Masyaf Assassins of the Third Crusade with its Western tenor rather than the Iranian Assassins of Alamut and its non-Western tenor, AC3's choice to make its story of a Mohawk revolve mainly on his white dad and his relations with white society; and Origins' decision to do a story and setting steeped in Ancient Lore in a time and place where the power is in the hands of European invaders, there's a timidity that prevents Ubisoft from taking the next step. The European games are likewise hampered by its obvious uncritical Eurocentrism and its refusal to engage with it outside the touristy EU propaganda stuff. Of the lot the New World games are the most interesting but even then not entirely successful. Every game, at its best and worst, shows some amount of compromise and timidity.\n\nFor all the credit it gets for shining a light on the unexpected and obscure, there's a hesitancy towards following through on the multi-culturalism that it announces on its disclaimer. **The main attitude is reminiscent of Samuel Goldwyn's famous maxim, \"let's invent some new cliches\"** or replace some cliches with new ones. There's a tendency towards touristy recreation and architecture over political and social development, older sources over newer ones.\n\n***SOURCES***\n\n1. *Alexandria, City of the Western Mind*.

[Black Flag](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9g6l2d/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/). Now Syndicate.\n\nSyndicate is a game that is hard for me to cover mostly because unlike the case of the earlier games (AC1-UNITY) which I thought at the very least had interesting settings regardless of the choices made by the team in execution, **Syndicate** **in my opinion is fatally weakened by the choice of setting it in Victorian London**. My feeling is that if you are to make a game with the AC themes and concept in English history, then London in the Elizabethan-Jacobean eras, or in the period of the Restoration around the time of the Great Fire and the Plague, are far better options. **There's also the fact that Victorian London and its culture have influenced a whole number of games and popular movies and as such this leads to overexposure**. Whether it's *The Order: 1886, Dishonored, Bloodborne* in games, and in the movies you have Coppola's *Bram Stoker's Dracula*, the Johnny Depp movie From Hell, the LXG movie, and of course the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes movies, Victorian London is easily the most popular period setting for mainstream movies, TV, and games, and even *Harry Potter* which is set in modern times has a fantasy world built on a Victorian era boarding school. **Overexposure is not a problem if what you are doing is drastically and dramatically different, subversive, and has a new and powerful point of view.** **Instead, Syndicate is more or less Guy Ritchie's Victorian London.**\n\nAs such I am going to skim the game and not go into it with too much detail. **Syndicate is a steampunk album cover** **come to life** with its grappling hook pistol and other kinds of gadgets. A grappling hook is physically impossible in real life at least in the way games like Batman use it. But where Batman is a superhero, the Assassins are set in historical fiction, the grappling hook in my view ruins the game owing to the historical background, the fact that Victorian London as it existed still survives to a good extent in contemporary London. It also ruins it in terms of aesthetics, the whole appeal of Parkour and climbing in the AC game, absurd and unrealistic as those are, was to get you to interact with architecture in a tactile way. That's gone with the grappling hook.\n\nSo let's begin:\n\n***MAIN CAMPAIGN***\n\n***Setting;*** Victorian London 1868\n\n***Sequence 1-3***\n\nThe beginning has two missions. One deals with a fictional character Rupert Ferris, and the other with the real-life scientist Sir David Brewster. Both are set in the countryside rather than the city. Evie Frye is the one who assassinates Brewster. I am a little disturbed that AC decided to have your heroes attacking and killing a man of science and pass this as heroic. About the only reason given for justifying this is that the real Brewster as in this game was a critic of Darwin and was a proto-creationist. I am not sure you can support scientific freedom and inquiry by using Darwin as a cudgel to get you board with killing someone.\n\nThen they come to London, and meet Henry Green, the nom-de-plume of an Indian dude called Jayadeep Mir (Half Sikh-Half Muslim, which I can tell you is a pretty big stretch). Then we meet Sir Alexander Graham Bell who was in London at this time. He's shown with an accent and they have his nickname Aleck correct. We also meet the real-life Sir Frederick Abberline who is usually shown in a lot of Jack the Ripper murders. He was actually a pioneering cop, and later in life got involved in Monaco shutting down gambling operations while working for the European Pinkerton branch. The weird bumbling and comical portrayal of Abberline in Syndicate seems way off from the real guy and from how cops were in Victorian London. Tough, a little hardened by the poverty and corruption, and certainly quite self-serious.\n\n***Sequence 4-6***\n\nThis part has fictional targets like Pearl Attaway (who I rather like as a character) mixed with John Elliotson (another real-life figure) and then Philip Twopenny (also fictional). Dr. John Elliotson is another man of science and assassination target. The real-life inventor of the stethoscope, and as the game portrays a man who practises the now-discredited pseudoscience of mesmerism and phrenology. The problem is that while phrenology was a racist and terrible contribution to society, it was mainstream and believed in for a considerable time, as was eugenics. And Mesmerism was also believed in at the time by a number of rational folks including Dickens who in his side missions isn't presented this way. Why single out Elliotson? As for Elliotson being a psycho doctor who tortures patients, there's no record of him doing that by himself, and again dodgy medicine in the old days is something that everyone did. Then we meet Florence Nightingale in Evie's mission where she cleans up Jacob's mess. She was in that time and place, and her renders matches her photographs so it's fine.\n\n***Sequence 7-10***\n\nMaxwell Roth is a fictional British gangster who leads the gang known as the Blighters. He runs his operation from Alhambra which is a real-life music hall and theater. The Alhambra did burn down in a fire but that happened in 1882 and not in 1868. Then we have Jacob Frye attacking and assassinating the real-life James Brudenell, aka Lord Cardigan, notorious for being a commander at the Battle of Balaclava where he led the Charge of the Light Brigade.\n\nNow who exactly is responsible for the blunder that is the Charge, whether it was because of bad orders, incompetence by the messenger, or the failure of the commanders to not request clarity has an entire cottage industry in military historiography dedicated to it. So I am not going to get into that. But some such as George Macdonald Fraser feel that Cardigan got a bad hand and followed bad orders as per his command. **On the other hand, Cardigan's personality as a pompous aristocratic stuffed shirt seems accurate, he was emblematic of incompetent military officers who bought the commission but didn't live up to it**, and the Crimean War led to reforms that ended this practise. Cardigan wasn't an entirely anti-peasant guy. He was an anti-reform MP but he supported the 1867 Reform Bill which the game doesn't mention (on which more later) for the same reasons many in the Conservative party backed it, i.e. stealing the thunder of the liberals. Jacob Frye also assassinates him in Parliament when in real life he died from an injury after falling from a horse (a rare case of a real-life death having more poetic justice than the fictional actionized one). Assassinating him in Parliament is also a weird choice because there was only one assassination in Parliament historically, that was the Prime Minister Spencer Perceval who got murdered by a disgruntled POW over his handling of the Napoleonic Wars in 1812. Between then and the 1974 IRA Bombings, there was no acts of violence committed in Parliament building.\n\nThis final part also allows us to meet Queen Victoria, in her grieving for Albert phase, wearing a black dress and so on. But the missions with her come after the game in some side-missions.\n\n***SIDE MISSIONS and DLC - Historical Characters***\n\nUnity was the game that had substantive historical content in its side missions where earlier games integrated it in the main title. Syndicate follows that with a series of chained adventures with Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin, Queen Victoria, and Karl Marx. \n\n\\- **Darwin's adventures don't really have anything to do with the man's evolutionary theories** and are basically a bunch of errands and so on. Given creationism's pull in America, I think showing him as a nice decent gentleman was a good way to go but not using those missions to explain and educate some of the basic nuts and bolts about \"natural selection\" and so on seems a waste, since it's likely a lot of gamers from some parts of America, and other places in the world inspired by America, would get a better education about it from here than in their classrooms. Syndicate is the first game set in a period where photographic records exist and Darwin's look is based on Julia Cameron Mitchell's photographs of the man in the 1860s. So that's fine.\n\n\\- **Charles \"Boz\" Dickens is shown as a Victorian debunker of ghost-stories**. Which he apparently did do as a hobby, being that he was a big international celebrity. What is **missing is Dickens' work as a social reformer**, which I think would be **more fitting for the Assassins to be involved with**. Dickens was especially agitating for better work conditions and especially for better treatment of prostitutes and \"fallen women\" which a number of Victorian authors (including Christina Rossetti) supported. **It's kind of weird that Syndicate doesn't have prostitutes when this was a big concern in that era. This also allows me to discuss briefly the Jack the Ripper DLC**, where basically the prostitute victims of the Ripper are retconned into undercover Assassins who took the identity of prostitutes. A game where you briefly play the Ripper but are never a participant in the horrible violence of his murders, and nor do we get a detailed look at the crimes he committed. **I never understood why you would make a Jack the Ripper story and not show the violence he did as graphically as you can, a waste of a M-Rated Ripper game.** The idea of Ripper as an Assassin gone bad is good material and I think that this should have been a plot for a full game, but it's not dealt well there. **The way they handled the \"identity\" of Jack is fine** and I am glad they didn't go with William Gull or whoever the hell they come up with every other week. But even then somehow making a dude murdering starving weak malnutrioned women from slums into some internecine secret-society feud is a little distasteful because it tends to shift focus away from the victims to the killer. The Ripper DLC also introduces prostitutes but the bizarre thing is Evie Frye lamenting how Whitechapel has fallen in disrepair when that neighborhood was renowned for being a vast slum for several years by then. **Attributing Whitechapel's decline to the Ripper as the DLC implies has it backwards** when the Ripper murders actually sparked reform efforts to fix these slum conditions.\n\n\\- **The Queen Victoria missions** are again a series of errands. But this one deals with terrorism. The terrorism is shown as Templars and apolitical, but the 1860s was actually the era of Fenian, Irish rebel terrorists. This was a much bigger deal than any of the gang wars that you actually see in Syndicate. The final scene where Evie humbly requests Queen Victoria to give up the Empire is gloriously cheesy and hilarious. I like Queen Vicky's condescending and cold reply, since too many stories make her out to be overly nice, which she was capable of in life certainly but she was definitely out to ensure that the Crown still had a purpose and place in the sun and that's why she allied with Disraeli over Gladstone, Disraeli made her Empress and gave her the title by Parliament.\n\n\\- **Then the big one, Karl Marx.** Showing Marx in a game targeting a lot of American consumers and showing him as a guy you could hang out with is something that should be commendable. Only **the Marx we see here is a bit of a clown**, the database entry is kind of silly and makes jokes about campus brocialists, and the cuddly reformist Marx we see here, while accurate in parts is not entirely truthful either. The missions are again a series of errands, no hint is given to his larger ideas and theories. And again I don't know why you would deal with someone like Marx and not touch on his controversial reputation and ideas. Likewise I think **there should be tension between Marx and the Fryes**. Jacob Frye is a kind of purposeless anarchist and Evie is a committed secret-society Assassin and both of them are gang leaders whose whole idea was fighting the Templar gangs of Blighters and replacing it with their own gang of street criminals. **Going by Marx's writings, the Fryes are lumpenproletariat, the elements of the urban poor who have no revolutionary potential and in times of crisis ally with the ruling class interests and serve as their enforcers, being criminals, miscreants, and so on**. We see this in the game where the Fryes ultimately support the British Conservative Party, Benjamin Disraeli and then get knighted by the Queen of England. **There's no way Marx would pal around with them**. **The game never has the Fryes being divided or challenged for their chumminess in allying with both sides of the political divide** or how using multiple interests serves the Assassin cause, but to a Communist or a radical this would mark you out as a fixer and an adventurer rather than someone with commitment.\n\n\\- **Then we have this special time anomalies mission where you are transplanted to World War I London and play Jacob's granddaughter** Lydia Frye. Unity had this feature too but there it was digression without story or impact to the plot, and here we get a slice of AC History in a discreet mini-campaign. **Lydia Frye is a suffragette and we meet Winston Churchill in his time as Minister of Munitions**, a position he landed after the disaster of the Gallipoli Expedition and some time in and out of position. It was his comeback tour. Churchill is shown here asking for Lydia Frye's help against Imperial German spies and saboteurs in exchange for help in putting female suffrage on the ballot. Churchill was a famous opponent of female suffrage, but by 1917 he did actually moderate and tried to get the conservatives to back it, so it's not impossible. The portrayal of World War I London allows AC to do a multi-timeline city, so we see the London Bridge and its mechanical drawbridge. We also have anti-air guns and zeppelin air-raids. Zeppellin air-raids definitely did happen but I don't know if was a phenomenon that late. The anti-air guns, model and make, is up for military buffs to check if it's period accurate. I doubt it is. I do like Churchill's introduction in the cutscene, the minute I saw the lighted cigar stub, I knew at once who it was. This sequence is pretty good for what it is, and World War I London doesn't feel like a waste of a period and this is a slice of Churchill's life that is obscure and not really storied, so I don't have a problem with how they handle it. \n\n***GENERAL OBSERVATIONS***\n\n\\- **The portrayal of London in SYNDICATE is pretty selective.** There are **a whole host of stuff missing from the game**, the British Museum (Karl Marx's stomping ground), the Crystal Palace (which given that it burned down later, you would think ought to be recreated in a game since that's how any of us will ever get to be there). Recreating a modern city with museums and cultural life, means that a Victorian London game that doesn't recreate the museums that existed at the time and the exhibits within (which still exist in the same places today) means that the fact that I can't visit the National Gallery and see Old Master paintings, go to Victoria and Albert Museum and see Tipu's Tiger automaton, or visit the Elgin Marbles...destroys a lot of the real reasons anyone would pay to play in a recreation of a real city, unlike GTA's fake ones. SYNDICATE remember sold to a lot of people around the world and it's cheaper for them to play this game then visit London by air and as such if you are going to do this period, not doing it in a thorough manner feels like some kind of betrayal. **UNITY's Paris had a huge number of crowd NPCs to signify the population growth of the city in the time of the Revolution, but London in the 1860s had a multi-million population, the biggest for any city in the world at that time.** As such, Syndicate lacks density and falls short of hsitroy.\n\n\\- London in the Syndicate era was Post-Sanitation Movement. But it was still pretty grimy and dirty compared to a modern city, and Whitechapel in particular was a slum area. There's none of that we see here in the game. The portrayal of crime and poverty is a little too prettyfied and the lack of detail kind of hurts it. The fact that we have a Thames river in the industrial era that is swimmable without adverse effects by Assassin superheroes on their bodies and skins, is a major letdown in terms of open-world realism.\n\n\\- As Bob Whitaker, quoted below notes, **child labour which we see throughout the game, in story and open world, was illegal by the 1860s, and already reformed out of its existence**. The Victorian age also started the whole concept of childhood as a special time of play, which led to Lewis Carroll's Alice books and something which was especially close to Dickens (owing to his own past as a child laborer). **The entire class uprising shtick that Jacob Frye keeps voicing and the Assassins trying to fight capital (represented by Templars) overplays a class war angle that was already dialed down** by the 1832 Reform Bill and then the 1867 Reform Bill which raised the voting franchise. Throughout this period, wages of workers increased thanks to their own activism and union work, and we don't get any sense of the union activity in the game. Marx wrote *Das Kapital Part 1*, which mainly deals with industrial accents and it was published in 1867, and we see little of that here. The idea of seeing street gangs like the Rooks, i.e lumpenproletariat, be the agents of anti-capitalist activity doesn't allow room or acknowledgement for the work of unions and other labor agitations in that period.\n\n\\- It's a common theme in contemporary Victoriana stories to downplay class, imperialism, LGBT and other issues of the time, so Syndicate is no exception. The fact that Jacob and Evie Frye being middle-class non-Londoners fit in immediately in the span of a year, or a couple of months is not believable. Jacob Frye's retro-punk affectations is a little too 90s Cool Britannia in the way it allows him to easily interact and talk with \"social superiors\" like Pearl Attaway, and especially Benjamin Disraeli, and the Queen. Evie Frye is more believably middle-class and acts like it, but even then there was definitely issues and tensions with unmarried middle-class girls who interact with aristos like Mrs. Disraeli and so on. But with Evie her being a British gangster and so on seems more of a stretch both from a social perspective and a character perspective. I wish the game went into more time and effort on accent and other class stuff, because in a modern setting and especially something like Victorian London, a prototype for modernity as we understand it, blending mechanic can't be simple as it was in the Third Crusade. Like blending in different parts of London should pay attention to costume, hat, beard, and other social details. And accents should be modified according to station and situation. In a time where you have photography, emerging mass media, telegraph, and a modern police, you can't expect me to think that a guy who attacks a bunch of people can disappear into a haystack or sitting on a park bench. We also have Ned Wynert, a transgender character who isn't called that within the game nor does the game address any of the hypocrisy and double standards for which the Victorians were proverbial. The creepy dynamic between Maxwell Roth and Jacob Frye makes homosexuality villainous and doing a Joker-Batman dynamic in Victorian England isn't saying anything.\n\n\\- Syndicate gives us two Indian characters with Henry Green (Jayadeep Mir) and the real-life Prince Duleep Singh, the deposed Prince of Punjab and political hostage, son of the legendary Raja Ranjit Singh, and who was the figure forced to hand over the Kohinoor diamond to the English crown, by coercion. The portrayal of Prince Duleep wearing Punjabi robes and a turban and his kind of nationalist slant is not accurate. Duleep Singh for a while was noted to have blended in and become a complete English gentleman and for a while was a playboy. And even when he did get serious about making a play for a crown later in his life, it was still Punjab and not Pan-India.  The most bizarre thing is the total lack of mention in the main game to the 1857 Uprising or Mutiny. This was the largest anti-colonial rebellion in the 19th Century in any nation and the game talks about the Crimean War many times instead. We also don't get any discussion of Ireland, the activity of the Fenian groups, Irish Home Rule, or for that matter agitations in Jamaica, and British activities in China. London was a global city in this time, and there should be immigrants and expatriates from around the world, from Eastern Europe, from Asia, and from Africa. But the NPCs are mostly white and we don't get any sense of the empire.\n\n\\- **Syndicate is the only AC game with Jewish characters**, Benjamin Disraeli and Karl Marx. He's a conservative MP who converted to Anglicanism for career reasons, he's a radical atheist expatriate who became one of the founders of modernity. Together, they fight crime mostly by allying with Assassin criminals to fight Templar criminals. Kidding aside, England had a thriving British Jewish community in this time, many of them rising out and gaining equality especially in the 1860s, where the anti-semitism that led to the Duke of Wellington forbidding extending franchise and legal rights to Jews, had somewhat receded. The backlash to Oliver Twist's Fagin was sufficient enough that Dickens had to write a positive Jewish character in hiits final book (before his death) *Our Mutual Friend*. And the British Jewish community were involved with and allied with many liberal and social causes. So I wish we saw more of that. And even then showing Disraeli as a clown entirely dominated by his wife, while Marx is another clown who seems too caught up in itself, seems a bit of a disfavour to them. \n\n***CONCLUSION***\n\nWhen I talked about *Black Flag,* I mentioned that the theme of that game is that the British Empire were bigger plunderers than the pirates was part of the game's conceit in portraying that period. *Syndicate* never quite gets around to the argument that the British Empire is a bigger crime syndicate than any street gang, and it's sentimental having-it-both-ways approach, palling with Marx and Queen Victoria as if neither costs them anything, ultimately hampers the game of any teeth. The writing is so lacking that to be honest, **Syndicate is the only game where I preferred and openly rooted for the villains**, namely Starrick, Maxwell Roth, and Attaway, **to the heroes**. The former are better written, better voiced, and better characterized, and I would totally have preferred a Templar game with this set. Anyone doing a Victorian England game that wishes to discuss its real history, and the reality of the life in that time, needs a strong purpose and a deconstructive view, similar to Alan Moore's *From Hell* (separate from the bad Johnny Depp movie).\n\n***SOURCES***\n\n1. *The Making of the English Working Class*.

Now it's Black Flag. \n\n Previously when I covered Rogue, and I mentioned that I considered that game to be the most inaccessible in the series. On the other hand, **BLACK FLAG is probably the most accessible game of the entire series**. A good chunk of the people who bought it did so for being a pirate game, or a Pirate GTA game, or as the Pirates of the Caribbean game that captured some of the adventure of the first film. The main character isn't a part of any secret society until the very end of the game.\n\n**BLACK FLAG is also a game that has gotten commentary** about its historical recreation and details, from Robert Rath at The Escapist and from Bob Whitaker at History Respawned, Luke Plunkett at Kotaku. So there isn't too much original to say that hasn't already been said there, and said better. In addition, Black Flag's developers drew from historical sources like the original book on pirates (*A General History of the Robberies and Murderers of the Most Notorious Pyrates)*and Colin Woodard's *Republic of Pirates*. With that out of the way let's start:\n\n**MAIN CAMPAIGN**\n\n***Setting***: The Caribbean in the period of the so-called Golden Age of Piracy, or British Piracy at any rate. Specifically Jamaica, Bahamas, Bermuda, Cuba, with small sequences in the Yucatan, Charlestown North Carolina, and the coast of Brazil, and the island of Principe in Africa.\n\n***Pop Culture View***: The Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and in games, *Monkey Island*, Sid Meier's *Pirates*, a bunch of other classic movies like *Captain Blood, Anne of the Indies*. The developers also cited Peter Weir's *Master of Commander: The Far Side of the World* as an inspiration (mostly for its more accurate recreation of ship combat than the pirates stuff).\n\n***Sequence 1-2 \\[1715\\]***\n\nThis part introduces four historical figures (Stede Bonnet, Governor Laureano de Torres y Ayala, Woodes Rogers, Bartholomew \"Black Bart\" Roberts). We also see the 1715 Sinking of the Treasure Fleet by a hurricane. In terms of dates and place of activity it all checks out. We meet Stede Bonnet in 1715, when he was, as the game shows a legal businessman with no criminal record. Unlike other pirates, Stede didn't need to go to piracy apparently, and was some kind of thrill-seeker. To be honest, given how badly Stede Bonnet's end turned out, I don't know why the game idealizes and sentimentalizes his friendship with Edward Kenway. As we see, Edward is the one who encourages him to join the pirates and idealizes it, which kind of makes him complicit and morally culpable in Stede's eventual death.\n\nWe meet Governor Torres and Woodes Rogers in Havana, Cuba. Torres is a highly obscure figure who seems to have been a footnote in history. Unlike what the game tells us later, **there is no evidence whatsoever for Torres being opposed to slavery in any fashion**. In fact, according to one university paper, from 2013 (the same year this game came out so it might not have been available to the developers), **Torres actually returned runaway slaves fleeing English territory back to their masters.** Black Flag tried to introduce the idea of Templars being against slavery even if most of its members are aristocrats in Spain, England, and New York. **On the other hand, Woodes Rogers being a slaveowner and slavetrader is totally accurate.** Less accurate is the somewhat boring and bland personality Rogers puts on in the game, when he was actually a pretty dashing figure. He also did have a scar on his face. Torres and Rogers being associates and pals falls in with the secret society motif so that's fine.\n\nThen we come to the 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet sinking. Year is correct. It did sink in a hurricane. The map places the sinking between Havana and the North of the map, which is Florida, and that is also correct. Since I gave ROGUE a yelling for its poor representation of natural disasters I suppose it's only fair that I criticize Black Flag for not showing a hurricane appropriately. But then again Black Flag doesn't have any weather machines nor does it say that devices causes hurricanes. So that's that. After that, Edward becomes captain of the Jackdaw. One thing that I wished we saw, is Edward actually being elected to be Captain. Because pirate ships elected their leaders. In the game it's implied and understated but we don't see it happen. Likewise it wasn't always the case that the captain is the same as the helmsman.\n\nWe also meet the Sage, later revealed to be Bartholomew \"Black Bart\" Roberts. Absolutely nothing is known of his early life, so the idea of him being a Lovecraftian reincarnation of a predecessor god, is neither here nor there, and is possibly the most creative infusion of science-fiction/conspiracy with history. I like the idea of a Sage being against both the Assassins and Templars, and it's a pity UNITY destroyed that concept with its Templar Sage.\n\n***Sequence 3-8 Blackbeard, Vane and the Nassau Flying Gang \\[1715-1718\\]***\n\nWe come to Nassau in the period of the pirate republic. We see Edward \"Blackbeard\" Thatch, Benjamin Hornigold, later we see Charles Vane, then \"Calico\" Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny (as a waitress), and James Kidd/Mary Reade. The bit about Blackbeard's name having multiple spelling variations with Thatch possibly being closest to the real one is recent research and is plausible. Charles Vane being a little more violent than the rest is correct. Mary Reade's earliest life is not known but she is recorded to have posed as a dude, so that's right, and James Kidd being her alias is quite common with a number of pirates in that time. So plausible.\n\nLaurens Prins was a real-life Dutch Pirate turned legitimate slavetrader. His mission and assassination didn't happen according to the game but he did come into conflict with some Nassau Pirates. We also see Governor Torres phrase his objection to slavery which we addressed above as a huge stretch. This mission conveys **the central theme about the game's portrayal of piracy.** Namely that **piracy was prosecuted by the same government(s) and society that saw slavery as legal**. Basically **the Spanish, British, and other European Empires were bigger plunderers and looters than these pirates could ever hope to have been**. The problem with any story about the pirates is that the audience secretly and vicariously roots for the pirates. The same with gangsters and other crime stories. We are fascinated by these rogues, desperadoes and so on. But most pirate stories have a good pirate and a bad pirate. The good pirate rarely does any actual pirate work. Jack Sparrow in the Pirate movies is obvious since most of the story is about him trying to get back his ship and involved in some supernatural stuff rather than actually robbing people. In Black Flag, even the good pirates absolutely rob people. Edward Kenway robs and loots and kills a lot of British and Spanish sailors, and one of the ways the story gets us on board with this, is highlighting slavery. The fact that Edward Kenway's first mate Adewale is a former slave and since he's the one who gleefully brings up robbing English ships (on account of what the database says is because of his kidnapping as a child by English slavers), we don't actually feel too guilty. Now **the idea of making pirates some kind of retroactive anti-colonial or anti-imperial thing is seductive and even Disney's Pirates movies do that**, the third one especially had the final battle being this big ship battle between pirates of multiple countries fighting the British Movie. **The reality is of course sketchy** **and the idea of using slavery/abolition as some kind of D&amp;D-esque morality alignment as it's used in Black Flag and other AC games is arguably less about condemning oppression and more about making you feel better about some white dudes in the 1700s**.\n\nA good example is how the game makes Hornigold a racist (i.e. in the implicit \"you let your First Mate carry a gun\" kind) and Blackbeard someone who accepts Adewale. Hornigold later becomes a Templar and him being a racist makes you feel better about killing him. Charles Vane later unleashes fire on a slave ship and Rackham talks about selling Adewale. **Based solely on their opposition to slavery, we see Edward Kenway, Blackbeard, and Mary Reade as the \"good pirates\"** since they treat Adewale as an equal and so on. Edward and Mary Reade also assassinate the slaver Laurens Prins. On the other hand **we see Governor Torres opposing slavery** in his conversation with Prins and I mentioned above that **this is more out of a desire to make the Templars \"complex\" and \"gray\"** than say anything real about the time. **This kind of idea is similar to the musical** ***Hamilton*** which also tries to get audiences to sympathize with one Founding Father as a good guy, namely Hamilton, while seeing Jefferson and Burr as \"bad guys\" when in real-life there is more evidence of Hamilton trading slaves than doing anything concrete to oppose it. *Rogue* and AC3 likewise whitewashes the involvement of Christopher Gist and William Johnson as slaveowners. **There's absolutely no way the Templars can be about control and power and oppose slavery in any meaningful way in the 1700s**.\n\nTo get back to the pirates. **In real-life it's true that about 25-30% of all pirates were escaped slaves. And some ships had it up to 98% runaway crew.** But accounts suggest that pirates often claimed to own their black crewman, either to provide legal cover and status, i.e. prevent them from being arrested as runaways and returned to plantations (charitable impression) or as a way to exploit and keep them bound to one captain (pragmatic and cynical impression). Blackbeard is noted to have bought and sold slaves, but he also allowed some to serve as crewmen. The game doesn't mention this but the Queen Anne's Revenge was originally a French slave ship *La concorde* (on which more later), and Blackbeard recruited some of the slaves there as his crew, but others were left behind. In general **pirates preferred slaves born in the West Indies itself who knew European languages and other skills**, and generally didn't give a damn about Africans brought home from Africa as slave labour. In other words, Edward and Adewale's kind of egalitarian friendship while not unlikely, would be rare, and when coming in colonial society, Edward would have had to pass Adewale as his slave given how the setting and society worked. And of course Adewale's status as a slave with long years of bondage in the Caribbean who learned many European languages would of course be easier for the pirates to get along with rather than someone from Africa and so on. In either case, **it's certainly valid to claim that for runaway slaves, piracy was better than slavery,** and piracy was definitely disruptive to the Atlantic Slave Trade, and to the game's credit, the pirates are never presented as any revolutionaries and so on. They are shown to be out for themselves, and their freedom first. But the subtext of Black Flag with its separation of good and bad pirates and so on, does tend to give people the idea that more of one kind could have made a difference.\n\nWe also know now that Blackbeard never killed anyone. In the game in one cutscene he kills someone but claims he does it rarely, so Ubisoft hedged its bets. Blackbeard's siege of Charlestown trying to get medicines, and then his death is fair. Although the game doesn't show him being decapitated and having his head mounted on the ship which feels like a waste of a M-Rated Pirate game. Charles Vane's conflict with Jack Rackham is a little unfair to Calico Jack. There wasn't a real mutiny. Jack outvoted Vane, and Vane got a sloop and a small crew of loyalists. Vane and his Sloop continued to pirate until he was caught in a hurricane, and crashed on an island separate from his crew before being picked up by the English.\n\n***Sequence 9-13: Hornigold's Doom, Black Bart's Rise and Fall, Ending \\[1718-1722\\]***\n\nWhen Rogers comes to the Bahamas and dissolves the short-lived \"pirate republic\", we see Hornigold accepting the pardon and becoming a pirate hunter. That did happen. And Hornigold did crash on New Providence where he went missing. So that part is fair. But again Hornigold is aligned with Woodes Rogers a slaveowner over Torres' objections, a \"Bad Templar\" and a \"Bad Pirate\".\n\nBlack Bart taking his costume from that of his fallen captain Howell Davis is accurate, and the cool speech he gives on being elected captain is a rephrasing of a real one he's recorded to have said in *General History*. Him taking a Portuguese Man o'War and converting it into Royal Fortune is accurate as is his idea of trying to impose rules and disciplines on his pirates. So he's cool as a character but **I am disappointed with how soft-pedalled Black Bart is in this game**. Bart's pirate activity was far more violent than others. He sunk a slave ship killing 80 on board and we don't see that in the game itself. It's also weird that the game ends with Torres' death than Black Bart even if he is for all intents the main villain of this story. We see Mary Reade and Anne Bonny pleading their bellies and that happened. I kind of wished we saw Rackham before his death led to his execution if only to hear Anne Bonny giving him one of the all-time great insults, \"If you fought like a man you wouldn't have to die like a dog\". Mary Reade dying and Anne Bonny disappearing from the records i.e. becoming part of Edward's crew and then maybe an associate of the Assassins happened.\n\nGovernor Torres did die in 1722 which the game fictionalizes into a fight in some dead god's bond villain lair which is okay I guess. It's a cool story and I love the ending. I can't be the only one disappointed that Edward finally became an Assassin, I liked him better as a pirate before he got religion, metaphorically speaking. Then the game ends and unlike many of the tavern songs, sea shanties and others, The Parting Glass is an historically apt folk song dated to the 1650s-1660s. The lyric \"Since it falls on my lot that I should rise and you should not\" is especially moving in conveying that mix of survivor's guilt and sympathy we have for these characters, which I think is easily the best supporting cast in all of the ACawa games.\n\n***SIDE MISSIONS/GAMEPLAY/OPEN WORLD***\n\nThe main narrative side missions are the Templar Hunt missions which gives you that armor in Du Casse's mansion. The mission with Anto, the Assassin leader of Kingston Jamaica deals with the Maroons. The Maroons of Jamaica were runaway slaves who joined and mixed with the native population to form an indigenous community, and in a series of wars with the English settlers, they forced treaties that guaranteed their freedom well before the 1833 abolition of slavery in all English colonies. The problem is that the First Maroon War happened in the 1730s so seeing the activity and agitation here is a little anachronistic but definitely runaway slaves were a big deal and a common enough occurrence. Anto being a Maroon and Assassin seems slightly weird since the Maroons were famously isolationist. They were fighting for their freedom and rights but certainly weren't out to free all the slaves of Jamaica, leave alone the Caribbean. Which of course does not in any way discredit or dishonor their struggle, their achievement and so on.\n\nAs commentators below and elsewhere have noted, the gameplay for BLACK FLAG where you more or less have to dominate the open world ocean, taking out sea forts, fighting battles with British and Spanish ships, and then destroying and capturing ships wasn't how pirates rolled. Pirates were stealth experts, and they operated by sneak attacks, and they avoided violence or tried to minimize it if only because a sunken ship provided smaller booty and an intact vessel was a way to sub-franchise your fleet. The pirates in real-life with rare exceptions didn't fight and loot the Royal Navies either. They mostly attacked merchant ships, sloops, schooners and others. They also attacked and targeted slave ships. The biggest pirate attack and greatest heist of all time was Henry Avery's brutal attack on the Mughal trading vessel Ganj-i-Sawai en route to Mecca, full of civilians, and Avery and his crew tortured, raped, and murdered them before looting and then disappearing. As mentioned above, Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge was a repurposed slave ship. The same was true of other pirate ships at the time. **So this is another way the game slants towards pirates as an anti-imperialist force within the gameplay, and while Edward is still a robbing and killing pirate as opposed to a faux-pirate like Sparrow, him not robbing merchants and others does feel like a cheat and a letdown.** It also gives the impression that slavery and colonialism was something done by the navy and not something participated by merchants and other commerce types. When that's what happened although many of these were honest merchants not involved in immoral stuff. **What I say is true also of GTA**, guilty of the same stuff, but **any game where you play a criminal which doesn't have you robbing innocent and honest people**, as per their time, **doesn't say anything meaningful about criminal behaviour and why audiences are fascinated by it**.\n\nPersonally I feel that this is also a weakness of open-world gameplay and GTA-style rags-to-riches progression because applied to pirates it can give a distorted picture. **Pirates weren't mob-bosses.** They never had any means to convert illegal money into legal money. They spent their cash, they rarely saved and invested, and being that they were hostes humanis gestes (i.e. Outlaw who could be killed without trial or if brought to trial sentenced without defense), that meant they were damned. However in an open-world game, having to navigate an ocean with a multi-star rating and keeping on the downlow from beginning to end, would be repetitive, and punishing to gamers and also discourage exploration of the map, even if that is how pirates actually operated and lived, constantly at risk, cautious, and moving and sailing out of sight. The particular way Edward Kenway operates as pirate, i.e. taking out forts, replacing old commanders with his own, ensuring secure ports-of-call, which ends up encouraging an acquisitive monopolistic spirit among gamers **is actually closer to how the British East India Company operated** in Western and Eastern India, especially around the Bay of Bengal as documented in Jon E. Wilson's *The Chaos of Empire*.\n\n***GENERAL OBSERVATIONS***\n\n\\- **Until** ***Black Flag,*** **no mainstream pirate story in any medium addressed slavery**, neither mentioning its existence, nor its presence. In the Disney Pirates films, we have Keira Knightley who is a daughter of a British governor and lives in a mansion. That social background by itself confirms that she had the life of a Southern Belle plantation owner with slaves for servants, slaves tilling her fields and so on. But in the movie her servants are white and European. We also see Orlando Bloom as a blacksmith and he's shown as some kind of feudal villager transplanted to the New World in love with the posh girl, and yearning for someone out of his class, but new world white settlers were rarely so romantic or cute. Someone like Bloom's character would save up, hope to buy his shop, and maybe some slaves to cut labour costs and so on. ***Sid Meier's Pirates*** **likewise never once addressed slavery in any of its text-heavy descriptions.**And Sid Meier's other Civilization games have been criticized for presenting a rosy view of civilization development and advancement, plucking stuff from multiple eras without dealing with their baggage. **So while** ***Black Flag*** **isn't free of romanticism and some amount of sentiment, it deserves credit** for simply putting pirates in that context, and acknowledging that it's a foundation for the entire system of imperialism built by Europe.\n\n\\- The Assassin Order in *Black Flag* is led by a Mayan guy Ah Tabai, and they as a whole have no interest in the pirate stuff and mostly ally with natives and other indigenous people. Since the game has you play Edward who is a non-Assassin, this allows the game to simply glance and present the Mayan and other tribal peoples without actually dealing with them. ***Black Flag*** **has the advantage of narrow focus, i.e. looking at events from the view of Edward Kenway and his journey,** and being that Edward is an asshole (like Altair) for most of the game, **the game does convey a sense of there being more to the Caribbean than Edward's own story**. That's rare for an open world to do but *Black Flag* does it.\n\n\\- **I talked previously about how** ***Rogue*** **scants class, accent, and ethnic issues.** ***Black Flag*** **in its main story touches on it in more accurate detail**. In the beginning when Edward is posing as Walpole among Torres and Rogers, he adopts a plummy accent but drops to a more common register with Stede Bonnet and among his pirates peers. Later there's the hilarious bit where he dresses as that Italian diplomat, who is a total spoof of Ezio (voiced by the same actor doing the same accent), and he again affects a bad Italian accent. The epilogue of Black Flag, that cinematic after the credits in London, has Edward speaking in RP (received pronunciation) to an English guy who tries to chat up his daughter, while when talking to Kid!Haytham he uses words like \"posh gig\" and a more common register. This stuff is something that should be a gameplay open world mechanic rather than in cutscenes, especially when you are about \"blending\" in and so on. **I will say that** ***Black Flag*** **has the best dialogue in the AC games by far** and one reason for that it is the use of accents to convey detail and so on.\n\n\\- **I wish we had more about the accent and class issue with Adewale** because as mentioned above, pirates preferred slaves who had the same West Indian background and knew European languages, and I wish there was some tension or guilt with him knowing that he was preferred to other slaves because he could talk to the white man. His friendship with Edward Kenway is one of the best parts of the game but like all friendships it has to have tensions and grudges, and that could have been explored. We don't see this dealt with in FREEDOM CRY either, where there doesn't seem much tension between the slaves brought in from Africa and him. In the middle of Black Flag, Adewale seems more into the idealization of Nassau than Kenway, which is not something that entirely works, but it's still acceptable.\n\n\\- **One big problem is the Anglocentrism**. We have the Spanish character Governor Torres, we have the Frenchman Julien du Casse (who looks like a French John Marston), the Dutch trader Laurens Prins but we don't get a sense of Spanish Pirates, Portuguese Pirates, and especially French pirates. The French pirates were the original boucaniers. They were also involved in Nassau, and Olivier Levasseur aka \"La buse\" (The Buzzard), was pretty active in that time and place. He also operated with Captain Howell Davis, Black Bart's leader and so on. I kind of wish we had more of a mix, such as for instance Edward Kenway's crew having Spanish, French, and other sailors. We should also see sailors from around the world, including lascar sailors from India who served in pirate crew. Early in development the idea was to make Crew into full characters rather than just Adewale, so we see that missing here.\n\n\\- **The Caribbean and its islands are way bigger than what the game conveys.** I especially like the fact that we can circumnavigate the coast of Cuba in the open-world in a time (at fast sail) in less than 10 minutes. The fact that Cuba is the largest island in South America, the 17th largest in the world, and easily the biggest landmass in the Caribbean (and bigger than Ireland and Sri-Lanka for sake of general comparison) somehow doesn't quite come across. But the environment and open-world ocean is attractive and spellbinding. I wish we had more heat effects though because sailing for a great deal of time in the open world in the hot sun doesn't strike me as being realistic. We have three cities (Havana, Nassau, Kingston) and some small towns, and some large islands (such as Providence) that have large separate maps. Nassau is a shantytown in the pirate era, barely a city. Kingston being that it's an English colonial city resembles the New World settlements of AC3 and Rogue. Havana looks a little more grand, and feels like an European city with Spanish style architecture. I have no idea how accurate this recreation this. The story largely takes place on the oceans and as such these cities and the inner-life feels remote. Kingston seems to have more slave plantations than Havana does however, but slavery definitely did exist in Cuba and indeed its history has a lot of slave uprisings. I don't know if it's out of some motivation for revisionism (i.e. the Anti-Spanish bias in English accounts known as \"black legend\"), but the overemphasis on slavery among the English, and the downplaying of it with the Spanish either in open-world or the character of Governor Torres, seems to go a bit more in the other direction in my reckoning.\n\n***CONCLUSION***\n\nBlack Flag along with AC1 is the best game of the series. And of the two, *Black Flag* is the better historical recreation of the period and as such is the most successful historical fiction of all the games. It's a game made with confidence but it also has modesty, i.e. the impression isn't that Black Flag is the definitive pirate story but simply putting forth an idea for how to think about pirates differently than how it did before. It provides a new set of questions and it finally makes pirates into something other than Punch and Judy figures. Who thought that Blackbeard could be a three-dimensional character again after spending so many decades as a Halloween costume?\n\nSo from British Pirates to British Gangsters in SYNDICATE next time. And more to say about accent and blending mechanics there (and the lack thereof).\n\n**SOURCES:**\n\n1.

        "text": "A few days ago, the LGBTQ society at Goldsmiths University was suspended [after threatening to send someone to 'the gulag' and then proceeded to post a series of tweets trying to rehabilitate the image of the Soviet Gulag.](https://imgur.com/a/7tCANaa) In doing so, they stretched historical facts and in some cases outright lied. I recognise this is verging onto Rule 2, and if anything I've said/am about to say violates it, please tell me so I can edit it.\n\n&gt;The Soviets did away with life sentences and the longest sentence was 10 years . . . The aim was to correct and change the ways of \"criminals\". If it couldn't be done in 10 years it, it couldn't be done at all.\n\nWhile it seems to be somewhat true that pre-WW2 sentences were generally no more than 10 years, [the case of Maria Tchebotareva is quite interesting.](http://gulaghistory.org/nps/onlineexhibit/stalin/crimes.php) During the Ukraine famine, she stole three pounds of rye from a field (which originally belonged to her) in an attempt to feed her children. She was presumably discovered by a local Bolshevik functionary and she was subsequently sentenced to 10 years forced labour. When her sentence was over, it was arbitrarily extended for several more years, after which she was forced to live in exile near her camp until 1956. It is completely dishonest to say 10 years was the maximum sentence or that the punishment of prisoners ended after their sentence was finished. Large numbers, probably hundreds of thousands, died in exile.\n\n&gt;Capital punishment was reserved for the most heinous, serious crimes.\n\nThe claim that 'capital punishment was reserved for the most heinous, serious crimes' is also a complete lie. According to Soviet KGB documents, *at least* 681,692 people were shot between 1937-38.^(1) And what backgrounds did the victims of the 1937-38 killings have? It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume a sizeable number, if not majority, were those deemed to be 'kulaks'. To back my claim up, we have Order No. 00447 from the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs of the USSR, dated July 1937. This order was issued during Stalin's revamped war against perceived enemies of the state which stipulates:\n\n&gt;I. All Kulaks, criminals and other anti-Soviet elements subject to punitive measures are broken down into two categories:  \na) To the first category belong all the most active of the above-mentioned elements. They are subject to immediate arrest and, after consideration of their case by Troikas, shot.  \nb) To the second category belong all the remaining less active but nonetheless hostile elements. They are to be subject to arrest and confinement... for a term ranging from 8 to 10 years...^(2)\n\nIt is worth noting that order No. 00447 permitted the execution of 55,000 people who were not guilty of any proscribed capital crime in the Soviet Penal system.^(3) And what was a kulak? 'Kulak', like 'reactionary', 'criminal' and 'Trotskyist' was vague Stalinist jargon for anyone who dissented from the regime.  This can be seen by the fact order No. 00447 seems to conflate \"Kulaks and criminals\" into \"anti-Soviet elements\". The term was coined in the Russian empire, but it was massively extended by Lenin's government to describe what they deemed to be uncooperative rich peasants. While they were affluent in relation to other peasants, the average Kulak family in 1927 comprised of seven member and owned \"two or three cows\" and \"no more than twenty-eight acres.\"^(4) They could hardly be described as rich, and it's unlikely that their position in 1936 was any better, especially when one takes into account the horrendous famine of 1932-33 which annihilated the countryside's livestock. In fact, one could perhaps argue it was worse off. Unless this society thinks 'kulaks' are 'heinous criminals' for owning two or three cows and up to twenty-eight acres, I think it's safe to say they are wrong.  It also goes without saying significant numbers of peasants were tortured and then deported to certain death during the famine for trying to hide food.^(5) This was effectively a death sentence.\n\n&gt;Educational work was also a prominent feature of the Soviet penal system. There were regular classes, book clubs, newspaper editorial teams, sports, theatre &amp; performance groups\n\nWhile I am sceptical of those who try equating the Holocaust to the Gulags, I find this line of reasoning to be similar to the Holocaust deniers who say 'Auschwitz couldn't have been a death camp because there was a pool and camp orchestra'. While it's true that conditions in the Gulags varied considerably in terms of dates and (likely) geography, I don't particularly see the relevance. The number of peasants who died in the Gulag or in exile during the 1930s was around 700,000.^(6) This doesn't include the million more who were deported to these camps simply for belonging to the wrong the ethnic group during the war.^(7) The fact prisoners could read Stalin's bibliography and recreate the October Revolution under Secret Police supervision does not change the fact conditions in the Gulags were at their best harsh, and at their worst barbarous.\n\n^(1) J.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9fcctd/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/",
        "text": "I started this series with [UNITY](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9d9ra2/assassins_creed_unity_a_near_complete_list_of/), then went to [AC1](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9dq6uy/historical_inaccuracy_in_assassins_creed_series/), [AC2](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9dzdbq/historical_inaccuracies_in_assassins_creed_series/), [Brotherhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9efp0k/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/), [Revelations](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9es3gt/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/), [AC3](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9f2ai7/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/). After AC3, Ubisoft chronologically went backwards with first Black Flag set in the Pirate Era in the Caribbean, and then **Rogue** which **is a prequel to AC3 that revisits the Seven Years War prologue**. Rogue was the last of the Seventh Gen Consoles games, coming out in the same year as AC:UNITY. Anyway, after AC3, I had two choices, going back to Black Flag, or going back to Rogue. Since I've already partly read up on the Seven Years War and Colonial Era, I will do Rogue first and then do Black Flag. **Rogue strikes me as being the least accessible of the main games**. To completely understand the game, or at least the main central campaign, the side missions, and the collectible lore, you need to be familiar with the basic Assassin-Templar conflict, the conspiracy motif about First Civilization stuff since the game's big dramatic scene and the entire conflict entirely revolves around that. You also need to know Assassin's Creed III, and to a lesser extent, Black Flag, and the tie-in novel Forsaken. The advantage of historical settings and periods is that each game can be newcomer friendly since even those who don't care for the overall stuff can come for the setting, the gameplay, the cities and so on. ROGUE owing to its brevity (at 6 sequences, it's half the size of AC3 and shorter than Brotherhood an Revelations) doesn't have that. It's mostly a sandbox title. As such **the game has far less historical stuff** than other games do, **however it also has the most brazen,** over-the-top **and ridiculous reinterpretation of any historical event** in the series. Anyway let's start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Setting***: The French and Indian War, North American theater of the Seven Years War (1752-1760), and the Lisbon Earthquake (1755)\n\n**MAIN CAMPAIGN**\n\n*Sequence 1-2: Shay's Assassin Years, the Lisbon Earthquake.*\n\nOur protagonist is Shay Cormac, an Irish Catholic immigrant to the New World who, along with fellow Irishman Liam O'Brien is part of the brotherhood run by Achilles, Connor's mentor from AC3. **Cormac being an Irish Catholic immigrant in 1750s America is pretty weird for a number of reasons owing to class and ethnicity.** The majority of early Irish immigrants to America were from Ulster province, and they were descended from the Protestant Ascendancy. According to one census from wikipedia, by 1775, only 20,000 Catholics counted in a total population of 2.5 million Irish immigrants in 1775 or as the book cited below states, one-fifth of the total Irish immigrant demographic. The big wave of Irish Catholic immigration happened after the Potato Famine a hundred years later. Irish Catholics in Cormac's day faced a lot of discrimination from Protestant Irish (later called Scots-Irish even if most aren't actually Scottish origin), as indeed did many Catholics at the time in USA. Not that this discrimination was equal to what was faced by black folks and native tribes of course. But it definitely did exist and still did even after the American Revolution. It's not an accident that all American Presidents with two exceptions have been White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. The exceptions are Kennedy who is Irish Catholic, and Barack Obama who is African-American Protestant.\n\nAs such **the part where Cormac would** **be** a kind of poor street criminal and then later **part of the Assassin brotherhood is believable**, since the Assassins are supposed to stand, at least metaphorically, with the oppressed, the outsiders and the marginalized. What is **less believable is that Cormac, especially with his name and his exaggerated Irish accent, would be accepted among the more Protestant-coded Anglo hierarchy**. It's weird because Assassin's Creed III actually addressed this. In an optional conversation with William Johnson in the Prologue of AC3, Johnson mentions his own Catholic roots and the fact that he had to convert to Protestantism to get ahead in life. That is true of the historical Johnson and is representative of the barriers of class and ethnicity. **Since the Templars are all about** taking the world as it is and **assimilating heavily into society's norms and mores to better exploit and undermine it**, the fact that **Shay joining the Templars does not involve some kind of real compromise** **such as converting to Protestantism** changing his name, or an attempt to put on a less ethnic accent, **makes it totally unbelievable**.\n\nIn previous AC games I had talked about how the games scanted religious issues, slavery, antisemitism, and racism. In Rogue and later Syndicate, they get class wrong.\n\nThe opening sequences introduce the Assassin brotherhood. Achilles is again the only African-American. We have Kesegowaase an Abenaki mercenary, two Irish Catholics, and a real life historical figure in Verendrye. An obscure explorer. Verendrye is the local asshole among the Assassins, insulting and making fun of Shay, calling him \"cabbage farmer\". **It's extremely weird that the only class discrimination Shay faces in Rogue comes from a Frenchman and not any of the English characters.** I mean in real-life since France was a Catholic nation, there was a lot of sympathy for the Irish among the French, and also the whole we-hate-England-too thing (which is why the French Royaume supported the American Revolution). It's possible for Verendrye to dislike Shay for being poor, but I don't know why he could be such a class snob in a specific way while still taking orders from the African-American mentor of the Assassin secret society. In either case,  **Verendrye** **~~should~~** **should'nt be an Assassin**. In real-life he and his brothers during their exploration in the Rocky mountains, traded Indian slaves, mostly captives from inner-tribe wars. So him being a jerk to some extent is fine, but being insulting to an Irishman is not. On the other hand, Verendrye seems to be cordial with Liam, so maybe it's just that he dislikes Shay. But since we play Shay, the framing and impression is obviously more personal.\n\nThen we come to the Assassin missions. The first one is Lawrence Washington, George's elder brother. This game makes him a Templar and bad guy. Washington's elder brother being a Templar feels like it ought to have come up in AC3 but whatever. We also get to see an accurate version of young George Washington with a full head of red hair during this party at his Mount Vernon estate, better than the one we saw in AC3's Prologue. The Assassins kill Washington because he's a slaveowning Templar (which as in the case with Haytham and William Johnson in AC3, makes them being pals with Verendrye odd) and they want some magical device. The next two targets are fictional. The one character James Wardrop is apparently a war criminal who massacred many Native tribes which is about the only hint to the pre-war context of the French and Indian War.\n\n**Now the big one. The Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755.** I have no idea who had **this idea to mash an event mainly relevant to Europe in the middle of the colonial context of the French and Indian War.** It doesn't fit, historically it makes no sense, and **the way it's presented in this game completely ruins ROGUE for me**. It's one thing to make magical objects like Apple of Eden metaphors for powers, charisma, authoritarian leadership that the earlier games did, it's another to have an object physically affect the tectonic plates. **It undermines the historical reality the characters are in**, makes what is supposed to be pulp-historical fiction into bad science-fiction and is s**o unreal and unrelatable to anything tangible** that the only way this **should be approached is as dark comedy rather than the serious way** this game tackles it. Until this sequence, the opening of Rogue had an interesting set-up but **since this is the whole plot of the game**, what the French and Indian War is actually really about as far as the characters and events we see are concerned, it's the moment that leads Shay to go from Assassin to Templar, and what he's trying to stop...basically Rogue bet big on this one set of cards, and it fell flat.\n\n**The entire disaster is also laughably staged.** You don't have to be a geologist or earthquake specialist to know that an earthquake happens because of movement of the plates way below the Earth's crust. Likewise, **historically the epicenter of the Lisbon Earthquake was in the Atlantic Ocean, 200km from the island of St. Vincent. Rogue places it in the lower-basement of a Church in Lisbon itself.** The earthquake in real life affected a number of places, but obviously the most famous and storied part is the destruction of Lisbon itself. And obviously, this should go without saying but the First Civilization tomb underneath the church is at best a very low-basement, It isn't anywhere near the center of the earth's plates to make this believable. Accepting this moment, requires you to buy wholly into the tinfoil mythology cooked up by Ubisoft, and to me it completely breaks immersion. The convent is Carmo Church, a real-life building badly damaged by the Church but if it was on top of the epicenter it would be totally obliterated. The destruction and damage caused by the Earthquake is no way as violent and brutal it should be. A shaking earth and so on should not lead to Parkour-ing terrain and Shay does none of the safety protocol that should guarantee survival. This is actually irresponsible because some of the places these games are sold to are vulnerable to earthquakes. In addition to the Earthquake, there was a Tsunami which also hit Lisbon after that, so I don't know why Shay thinks the water is his hiding place. There should also be smoke and dust from crumbling buildings especially several crumbling buildings. This is one of the great tragedies of the 1700s and Ubisoft does not do justice to it at all.\n\n**AC has an advantage in historical settings since obviously the Lisbon Earthquake is no longer the big deal it is today as it was in Europe in the late 1700s,** when this was the event that sparked an existential crisis, led many European intellectuals to question faith and philosophy. Th**e Lisbon Earthquake also marked the start of modern earthquake science and engineering**, since the scale of destruction to a major European city led many to seeks ways to understand it, and salvage old buildings to save more people. The problem is that historical knowledge and meaning is undermined by Rogue's insistence that this was caused because some Irish guy following orders messed with technology from some dead precursor race of gods. **In real-life the Lisbon Earthquake** as seen in Voltaire's poem and his Candide, **sparked a crisis of faith** **because** it couldn't be explained or justified, **it seemed random and inexplicable** as most natural disasters often are even today and the existence of a benevolent God or any benevolent well meaning force in nature was no longer supportable. **In Rogue, the disasters has a rational explanation and isn't random** in the least and **its main contrivance is to get us to root for an Irish guy allying with West Britain to go after his old multicultural pals because that's what happens when a black guy is in charge of a secret society**.\n\nThat is why I consider this the most brazen, bizarre, distasteful, and ridiculous recreation of a historical event in all of the AC games. Not merely because of how poorly it is done because it uses its bad science-fiction schema to interpret and explain it. The only reason this didn't get criticism was because Rogue came out with Unity, and its release was softpedalled and it got undeserved praise owing mostly to the fact that it's launch wasn't as bad as Unity's and it had Black Flag's naval component which is still fun and satisfying in Rogue albeit more impersonal and less organic.\n\n*Sequence 3-6 The Seven Years War, Templar Shay.*\n\nThis part has Shay taken in by a family of white settlers who are harassed by Assassin gangs (which I will deal with later). Shay gets taken in by George Monro, a real-life figure famous for his death during the ambush by Montcalm's Indian allies outside Fort William Henry. We see part of that and the ambush is attributed to the Assassin Keseegowasee. Which is okay I guess. I mean Monro's role here is mostly as Shay's Templar sponsor so whatever.\n\n**We also meet explorer and surveyor Christopher Gist** who is shown as an affable if sinister guy. Gist was a real figure and he was actually part of the Braddock Expedition seen in the prologue of AC3 where he saved Washington's life. He also died of smallpox in 1759 according to every academic source I've come across but he lives through the events of this game. Gist also has a partner called Jack Weeks, the token black templar, who the biographies says was someone Gist befriended and semi-adopted. **In real-life, Gist was a slaveowner and is unlikely to have such semi-egalitarian friendships** **with African Americans** in that time. However, since the Templars are obviously manipulative of Shay, I think it's likely they are putting a facade before him about them being progressive until he's so thoroughly part of them that he can't back out. Verendrye died in 1761, whereas here it's stated in 1760. He also died in Cape Breton off the coast of France. His ship was called Auguste, where here it's called Gerfaut. We also have Captain Cook. For some reason he's shown as a Scottish dude even if he was English and raised there.\n\nThere's also the finale and epilogue. Some memory of which fragments are played repeatedly. It shows Shay accompanying Benjamin Franklin to America in 1776 during his time as ambassador trying to get French support for America. Some gangs try and jump him which Shay prevents and then it segues into the kid flashback from the start of Unity shown in low-render seventh-gen rather than eighth-gen. Rogue's Versailles compared to Unity's Versailles is an interesting one for people to look at. For my eyes, it feels like the developers made Versailles look uglier intentionally as a way to promote Unity. It doesn't match the recreation of ornate monuments in the Ezio games or the Spanish architecture in Havana.\n\n**SIDE MISSIONS**\n\n1. The Game has Legendary battles. i.e. big ship encounters returning from Black Flag's Legendary Ships. The Battle of Quiberon Bay is recreated here. Both are real-life naval battles during the Seven Years War. Shay has a Sloop of War, a souped-up small ship which is totally unusable for a big naval engagement like Quiberon Bay which was fought with frigates and ship-of-the-line which the AC Naval sections call \"brigs\" for some reason. Sloops and schooners were used during the French and Indian War but for the smaller engagements in shallow inner waters.\n2. The big thing in ROGUE are these gangs. They are criminal groups Assassins support, mainly loyal to Hope Jensen and in both the main story and some side missions harass New York white settlers. For Shay, the Assassins being supporters of these gangs is a come-to-Jesus moment for him being a Templar. Being set in the 1750s New York, and for the fact that Shay is shown to oppose slavery, it's weird that he's bothered with these gangs. Because the fact is that in this period New York was the second biggest slave city in the 13 Colonies. A number of these gangs actually included runaway slaves and some of them were fully black bandits who both helped slaves, one of the most famous being a full-runaway slave gang called, awesomely, the Geneva Club that seemed to run like a secret society. A lot of paranoia towards gangs in this period was driven by fears of slave uprisings. Most famous example was the Conspiracy of 1741 which happened a decade or so ago but the aftershocks of that should still be in the city by this time. **So Shay being this Templar who aids Monro in gentrifying New York by cleaning up the crimes of mostly minority and minority-backed criminals for the better comfort of white settlers is a weird and sleazy projection of the Giuliani-Bloomberg era back to the 1750s.**\n\n**GENERAL OBSERVATIONS**\n\n\\- **Rogue is set during the the French and Indian War** **but has practically little to nothing to do with it**, or say about it. It's big dramatic issue and plot is the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake. The real French and Indian War saw much displacement of land, and the ultimate losers were the Natives. Before, with the French being this European superpower, and the North American continent contested between France and England, meant that either side depended on native allies but the French moreso because their population of white settlers was smaller. Their defeat meant Native groups had no rival hegemony to turn to protect them from the English and the Colonials. **Rogue doesn't deal with why the Assassins support the French against the English during this war**. It only invokes it over the issue of the Assassins supporting slaves against French Haiti but supporting the French in North America, which again is a good example of the Assassins foreign policy getting more entangled but essentially Rogue **makes the story entirely about Cormac and Earthquake Machines**.\n\n\\- The idea of playing as a Templar, the second secret-society in this series, who are mainly the bad guys of these games was potentially a good idea and still is. It could at least shine another light and make it more complex. **However the thing about looking at things from a villain's point of view is that you still need to own up to the villain being a villain**. In *The Godfather,* we look at American society from the perspective of Italian-American mafia and we see them being involved in business, in politics, in entertainment, and we get a sense of the hypocrisy of American society towards criminal classes. But *The Godfather* never pretends its criminals aren't criminals. ***Rogue*** **pretends that the Templar are good guys while never getting Shay to act like the Templars we meet at the start of the game or in earlier games.** At the start of the game Shay's Templar targets are a slaveowner, a corrupt banker, and a war criminal who committed massacres. Later in the game, Christopher Gist insists that those were \"good men\" i.e. the slaveowner and war criminal are considered by Shay's Templar buddy to be good guys. The real-life context of Monro's urban renewal of New York and the anti-gang activity, as well as Gist and William Johnson being slaveowners means that **the Templars in this game are a bunch of white supremacists** and **yet we never get any acknowledgement of that**. Them accepting Shay Cormac, an Irish Catholic with a gaelic sounding name and obvious accent is simply ridiculous for their class and station.\n\n\\- The only thing that Shay cites for joining the Templars is this entirely made-up and contrived earthquake machine plot. There is nothing within the setting, within the character internally, and within the activities of the other characters that makes him do that. **Throughout the game Shay keeps saying \"I make my own luck\" but in fact he's basically a puppet of the plot and the Templars.** The players are never invited to challenge or make their own mind, but basically just go along with the ride. **There is no reality in his character and his situation.** Shay also seems to dislike the French and support the English for no reason other than Verendrye dislikes him, **he faces none of the discrimination that Irish Catholics faced then and makes no compromise to assimilate with the hegemony**. We get no insight or rational explanation for why the Assassins support gangs, or support the French. And no sense of character growth. No sense of how much he agrees or disagrees with his peers. It's distasteful that the first Irish Catholic protagonist in the AC series should be some collaborator with the English, which does real disservice to the anti-colonial struggle faced by the Irish while also scanting the trouble faced by Irish Americans in the New World.\n\n\\- In terms of map, Rogue gives us New York, the Hudson River Valley in the 1750s before the Great Fire so it's bigger. But the game lacks AC3's dynamic weather system and it borrows much of its visual style and aesthetic from Black Flag which is set in the Caribbean, **so we have New York City with the weather of Havana in Rogue.** The city is basically made-up and rewound from AC3 to be more gamey. New York certainly has its hot days but from playing the game you get the sense that it's a city that is sunny all the time. AC3 which covered the city with grays/snow/fall/summer was much better. The Hudson River Valley feels obviously compressed and has the same issues as AC3's Frontier. **The North Atlantic and Arctic which we play here feels like it should be colder and harder** to navigate by both ship and on land than the game shows it. We have ice-breaking technology and Shay can't swim too long in the cold waters but it's not enough. **The fact that Shay doesn't wear anything to cover his face in the cold ruins it. I mean this is where the Assassin Hoods are rather practical, albeit it should be thicker and covered in wool.**\n\n\\- In terms of wildlife, Rogue give us the extinct species of Great Auk, the Arctic cousins of the Penguin. It's really cool and interesting to see extinct species, if a little sad.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nMechanically, ROGUE is passable and has fewer bugs, more variety than Unity and Syndicate does. The traversal is quite good and the open world map feels nice. The story largely feels like fanfiction to me, since it has nothing to do with history and entirely to do with its constantly retconned and contradictory lore. It's too short and contrived. **The appeal of playing as Templars, as the villain is ruined if everything is slanted to make excuses for them**, so that they are actually the heroes. **The point of playing the villain** is to be the villain and **to explore a darker side of humanity,** and the Templars provide a chance to do that especially in a historical context. **Say what you want about George Lucas, but he never dodged the fact that Darth Vader killed and tortured innocent people** in both the prequels and the original films. I have talked in earlier posts about how sanitized the Assassins tend to be, and how their weird patronage and support for noble factions is glossed over or downplayed. Showing the Templars in a historical reality and owning up to all the dark stuff in the past would have been unique. After all even **Rocksteady's Red Dead Redemption has John Marston as a \"good cowboy\"** someone who rarely shares the racism, sadism, and psychopathy of the other characters in the wild west, who isn't implicated in those actions since the Chaos System means that whatever bad things he does is really the player doing it. ***Napoleon: Total War*** **and other battle games never own up to the war crimes that happened during those campaigns**. As a Templar during the Seven Years War, you could have a game implicate the player in actions like native displacement, class snobbery, and imperial supremacy and hegemony, all of which underpinned the Anglo-French rivalry that led to the conflict.\n\n***SOURCES***\n\n1. *Dictionary of Manitoba Biography*.

        "text": "I started this series with [UNITY](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9d9ra2/assassins_creed_unity_a_near_complete_list_of/), then went to [AC1](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9dq6uy/historical_inaccuracy_in_assassins_creed_series/), [AC2](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9dzdbq/historical_inaccuracies_in_assassins_creed_series/), [Brotherhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9efp0k/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/), and now [Revelations](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9es3gt/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/), which I am going to engage with the history and context, to measure its efficacy as recreation, draw up lacunae, the weird tension between history and fiction underpinning it.\n\n**AC3 like Revelations has 2 protagonists in 2 settings**. This time it's chronological, starting with Haytham in the Seven Years War, and then picking up with Connor in the Revolution. It's also like AC2, a game that covers a big span - 30 years of history. AC3 was the first AC game I played and as such I tend to be quite fond of it even if I freely acknowledge that it is a game of glaring flaws in story, gameplay, open-world design. **It's an over-complicated and over-written mess, divided between being both a war game and an Assassin game, satisfying as neither**. **Historically, the game's approach is quite baffling on a lot of levels**, both for the arguments in the story and the angle it takes in presentation.\n\n**HAYTHAM'S CAMPAIGN \\[1754-1755\\]**\n\n*Sequence 1-3*\n\n**The opening sequence is set in London** during the Georgian era and we attend a performance of *The Beggar's Opera* at the Covent Garden. The Georgian era was famously plush and ostentatious being a society where \"the arts were a creation of commercial culture and not the Royal Court\" as John Brewer states in *The Pleasures of Imagination*. The costumes here are too drab. **At Boston**, Haytham meets Charles Lee, John Pitcairn, Thomas Hickey, William Johnson, Benjamin Church. All of them Templars, and with the exception of Haytham, they are all historical figures. I can't trace the Church's whereabouts in 1754. Pitcairn was stationed in Canada, and there's no record of him being on Braddock's bad side. But Hickey worked under William Johnson, and both Johnson and Lee were part of Benjamin Braddock's expeditions and campaign. So that works out. **The big thing about AC3 is that the historical Charles Lee is divided into two characters in the game**. This is something known in tvtropes as Decomposite Character. **There are two Charles Lees** in this game. One is **the game's Charles Lee, an insulting, cantankerous, frowning soldie**r, **and Haytham who gets the historical Lee's rumored relations with a Mohawk chieftain's daughter.** As Philip Papas notes in his 2014. Biography of Lee, liaisons between British soldiers and Native American women were quite common in the period of the French and Indian War. The Native Americans were less prudish than the British, and there was none of the fuss about babymamas asking for alimony, and creating a fuss as in England. Most Native tribes didn't have the issue about illegitimate children or single mothers that the English metropole and settlers did. Charles Lee though was still a piece of work. The real William Johnson for instance acknowledged his Mohawk children, whereas Lee abandoned them. **Anyway since Haytham is part Charles Lee, his romance with Kaniehtí:io makes sense and is sociologically correct for his class and situation**.\n\nAC3 scants the entire background of the French and Indian War. The major historical event we see is Haytham's section is the Braddock Expedition. **The game's portrayal of Major-General Edward Braddock is totally over-the-top**. There's little record to suggest that he was this psychopath the game makes him out to be. **His model also looks pretty young. He was 60 at the time of his death but the model looks like he's near Haytham's age**, slightly older at best. Braddock's conduct in this expedition is debated by historians. The usual back and forth he's-an-idiot/he-did-the-best-he-could kind. But anyway The Battle of Monongahela isn't like it is in this game. **In general, AC3's portrayal of pre-1793/pre-Napoleonic European style battle is more Hollywood than Hollywood.** Like they show this battle as an ambush by Templars but it was actually a spur on the moment skirmish turned into a battle, and **Braddock did not abandon his men to die** and run away, **as he is shown here**. He stayed with his men, died in battle. **We also see British soldiers panicking, beating a retreat and breaking formation,** and while they did retreat it was only when they got flanked at the sides and were getting encircled that led them to dive back.\n\nThe outfits in AC games are pretty silly in general, but Braddock not looking like a senior military officer and leader of the entire expedition is ridiculous. **We also get our first glimpse of George Washington. At this time, during the French and Indian War he was young and had red hair, but instead Ubisoft stuck a powdered wig on him** because they wanted him recognizable (you can finally see period-appropriate red-haired Washington in a cameo in Rogue).\n\n**CONNOR'S CAMPAIGN \\[1760-1783 AD/CE\\]**\n\n*Sequence 4-5 Connor's Origin Story/Boston Massacre \\[1770\\]*\n\n**The big issue with Connor's village burning down in 1760** was that at this point the fighting in the French and Indian War thinned down. The Mohawk tribes were allied with the British, and this incident of the burning of his village is initially suspected by him, not without reason, to be done by Charles Lee, and later revealed in the game's plot to be done by British officers under the command of George Washington. Basically **everything is wrong with this contrived scenario**. Washington retired his commission and wasn't in service and if the fictional village was part of the Kanienkaha;ka affiliated with the Haudenosaunee, they would be allied with the English, so there's no military reason for them to attack their own allies. After the French and Indian War ended you had Pontiac's Rebellion where British officers displaced many tribes in the Great Lakes Regions so that they could claim former French held territory for themselves, but that didn't happen in the Mohawk River Valley which is where Connor's village is supposed to be based. Neither Charles Lee nor Washington were involved in anything like this at this time.\n\nThen later we segue to teenage Connor and he gets a spirit vision by Juno. Then he meets Achilles who tells him of the Assassins v Templars conflict and about his Templar dad. **Here's a good example of how overwritten AC3 is. Connor has like, 7 motivations for his Hero's Journey. That isn't good writing.** He is over-motivated. As a kid he saw his village burnt down and was racially abused by some white dudes (including Charles Lee, whose presence there before the attack is never explained clearly in the game). Then he gets a vision and prophecy to become an Assassin, and then finds out about Templar Dad. **This is way too much**. The game is paced poorly. We have a totally unnecessary prologue with Haytham that only works as a plot twist and tells us nothing about the main conflict that we don't already know and doesn't show us anything about the French and Indian War aside from Braddock's Expedition with little sense as to how that affected the American Revolution. The protagonist only comes in after the first Act, and then it takes another two sequences for him to become an Assassin, and for the American Revolution to begin. **So basically the game's plot and story, the stuff advertised on the box-art and back-cover synopsis, begins halfway into AC3 which leaves the Revolution and its events, build-up, battles to happen in a very jet-propelled fashion**.\n\nLater Connor meets Achilles and arrives at the fictional Homestead. The idea of an African-American or in Achilles' case a Caribbean-African-American becoming a property owner, leave alone something as big as the Homestead mansion strikes me as being rare for his time. But I suppose it's not implausible for a freedman to claim untended land and slowly build a home, especially since this was the Pre-Revolutionary era under the British. Although one of the problems that led to the revolution was that the British were undermanned governing in America leaving local authorities to do it ad-hoc while still being taxed without representation. Besides Connor spots some white settlers trying to drive him away which seems likely and at least hangs a lampshade.\n\nThe big historical event and the first major event of the Revolution is the Boston massacre. We also meet Samuel Adams, leader of the Sons of Liberty. **The Boston Massacre representation is ruined because for the victims they chose random NPC designs rather than full models.** It would have been cool if we met some of them as characters only for them to die. **Especially missing is Crispus Attucks, part-African, part-Native American/mulatto who was apparently the first to die** and was lionized in his time as a martyr. **You have to squint and look at the black NPC in the cutscene to figure out that this is Attucks**, a figure lionized in African-American history.This sequence also gives us our first look at the Aquila sailing, where we meet the Pete Best of Haytham's Templar boy band, **Nicholas Biddle, a real-life captain**. Biddle is featured in one of the game's side missions. **Biddle's character model looks very old but in fact he was only 28 when he died** and he should be designed to be a little older than Connor.\n\n*Sequence 6-7 Boston Tea Party  \\[1774\\]*\n\nThis sequence shows the American Revolution proper beginning. Thanks to **the mess of nonsensical poorly written motives Connor has for starting his hero's journey**, his motivations for assassinating William Johnson, supporting the Sons of Liberty, and supporting the Revolution, and then Washington are laid out in detail in this section. In isolation and in sequence, they have the appearance of complexity, but it **falls apart historically**. Like Connor opposes Johnson because he's a Templar and friend of Charles Lee, he also opposes him because his local village is facing land appropriation by Johnson, he's then told that throwing British Tea in Boston will somehow stop this. Then when that doesn't work he straight up murders him, which he was planning to do anyway.\n\nAnyway, from what I have gathered, **there isn't any evidence that William Johnson was in any way affected by the Boston Tea Party** aside from the fact that he was an Englishman with a title and he naturally had concerns. He died before the outbreak of the Revolution but there's every reason to assume that he would have been a Loyalist, his children certainly were. **Johnson's main business and property was land. He was a huge landowner, and owned some 60-80 slaves living like a Southern plantation man in New York state.** Johnson is an interesting character in that he had excellent relations with Mohawk tribesmen and as an Agent for Indian Affairs was quite keen for maintaining the Crown's restrictions on colonial settlements into Native territory. The problem was that he was also a man who wanted to profit of that, so in the treaty of Stanwix, mentioned by the Iroquois in the Assassination mission, he actually fudged one of the rules extending the limits a little westward, in the process extending his domains. Now historians are divided. Some see that as pure self interest while others see Johnson acting with the accord of Iroquois by including land of little value as a compromise and sop to the settlers. The real Johnson did die in 1774 in front of Johnson House (recreated in the game) but he died of illness and wasn't assassinated. But you know, credit where due, time and place of death is accurate. **It's just that it doesn't make sense for Connor as a Iroquois/Kanienkaha;ka to kill or hate Johnson.** **He would have to know as many in his tribe and the Haudenosaunee knew that Johnson** was **for all his faults, honorable to the Mohawk** and was basically the one guy trying to stop the expansion of settlements. He managed to convince the British Crown to put some strength to enforce this compromise. Johnson was popular and liked by the Mohawk certainly. It's certainly not inconceivable for Johnson to have the paternalistic and condescending racism he shows in his final speech about the iroquois being incapable without him. But him trying to force Iroquois to support him by gunpoint is way off.\n\nThe Boston Tea Party gives us our first glimpse of Samuel Adams and shows the event itself. **The Boston Tea Party had a bunch of white dudes dressed as Native Americans (mostly because they wanted to hide their identities)**, whereas here you have white dudes dressed as regular NPC with only Connor as Mohawk, which seems dubious to me. There is debate about whether the Boston Tea Party was a planned protest, a spontaneous one and so on. There is no evidence suggesting, as this game openly does, that Adams ordered it or planned it. **The game converts a non-violent protest into a violent free for all...and I for one can't wait to see how Ubisoft handles Gandhi and Dr. King**. We can definitely expect to see Asassins violently killing people by the dozens while the great leader does his symbolic action. The game's portrayal of Samuel Adams being personally against slavery but no active and public abolitionist seems fair. But then **the issue of slavery and abolition is something that is a running theme in all the New World games and I'll have more to say later** in the game with Haytham, with Torres in Black Flag and for that matter Rogue.\n\n*Sequence 7 and 8: Outbreak of War, Thomas Hickey's Death \\[1775-1776\\]*\n\n**One of the most bizarre moments** in AC3, the entire franchise and indeed **in all of gaming, is the Paul Revere's Ride mission**. It's just silly. It looks stupid to see Paul Revere riding behind a huge guy giving orders and directions. I can't imagine who thought this was a good idea for a mission to design, script, and stage. One thing I don't get is why the games kind of focus on Longfellow's idea of Revere, rather than the fact that there were five riders, of whom Sybil Ludington rode a much greater distance. Including Ludington would have at least included more women in this game.\n\nThen we have the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The game never spells out who fired the first shot and so on, and I commend Ubisoft for keeping that mystery. Not everything has to be some grand plan, and history is allowed to happen by accident, confusion, tension, and human error in this moment. The retreat from Lexington seems accurate. The battle at Concord has Connor command battalions under the orders of Colonel James Barrett (who has an anachronistic more modern American accent for some reason). This is a very souped up approach to combat and is unsatisfying. Connor tries to halt an advance from a bridge while other forces retreat and that's minor. **AC3 stages 18th Century combat like a modern action movie** when this was a more slower pace and more attritional, but still Lexington and Concord were pretty action packed moments from real history.\n\nNext we have the Battle of Bunker Hill which was actually fought at Breed's Hill where we listen to Israel \"whites from his eyes\" Putnam. We don't actually see the battle and instead we have Connor advance in the space between musket-fire volleys. Now I might be wrong but IIRC British soldiers were famous for their volley fire and reload times precisely to stop stuff like this. John Pitcairn is rumoured to have been shot by Peter Salem, an African-American Patriot soldier. And while you could squint to see Attucks as the black NPC in the Boston Massacre, I struggled to find black NPC among Patriot soldiers even if there were quite a lot. There should also be black NPC in the Loyalist/Crown army, since during the American Revolution both of them fought in opposing armies. As racist as people back then, they still made a distinction between Mohawk and black men, and I don't know if it's okay for AC3 to pass off the accomplishments of black soldiers on to a Mohawk.\n\n**The next sequence is a bizarre series of linear setpieces that has us following Thomas Hickey to New York**. Thomas Hickey was the first man executed by the American government in 1776. He's shown as this low-rent scummy underworld type and he might have been that privately, but in public Hickey was actually part of Washington's bodyguard retinue until he was caught. The bizarre tangle of events that happen here, with Connor arrested and then taken to be hanged, surviving that, and then hacking Hickey down is silly. The real Hickey however was executed by hanging in public in New York.**The main reason this sequence is so compressed is that originally the developers wanted to put the Great Fire of New York in the game.** That happened when the British took over the city from Patriot control in late 1776. We don't get to see open-world New York until after this mess. The developers couldn't make the Great Fire work and you can tell they scrambled to fix the plot and the result is this tangle of cutscenes and linear setpieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 9 and 10: The Haytham and Connor Show/ Sullivan Expedition/ Battle of Monmouth (1776-1778)*\n\nBenjamin Church was indeed a traitor and British spy and he died on a ship en route to sea. So the way the game shows it is plausible. The big issue in this section is the entire Connor-Haytham debate, Haytham's plans, Washington's character, Charles Lee, the Mohawk allegiance during the Republic. Which means **this part of the game brings out all the historical baggage** and mess made by Ubisoft. For those who don't understand what happens. Haytham the Templar Dad shows Connor his Assassin Son that Washington is ordering the Sulivan Expedition. Washington then tells Connor that the Mohawk are Loyalist. Then Haytham adds that Washington burned Connor's village and killed his mother in 1760. Basically **all of this stuff is absurd.**\n\nAs mentioned previously, Washington was retired in 1760, and at the time he and the Mohawk were supporting the British. Conducting an independent war crime is something that no one has ever accused or found evidence of Washington doing. The bigger issue is Connor's total ignorance of the allegiance of the Mohawk to the loyalist cause. **When AC3 came out,** [a number of historians and commentators](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/are-video-games-like-assassins-creed-rewriting-history/article9237302/) [noted](http://thenerdstreamera.blogspot.com/2013/01/final-review-of-assassins-creed-3.html)**that it was weird to see a Mohawk fight on the side of the Patriots because overwhelmingly most of them were loyalist and supported the British.** Some of the most prominent figures were the likes of [Joseph Brant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Brant).  There were native tribes who supported the Patriots but most of them were in the Southern theater and not the North. **For Connor to be a Mohawk and be a prominent Patriot agent, would almost certainly mark him as a pariah, turncoat, and collaborator among his own tribe, a complete minority of a minority, renegade and marginal in their scheme of things.** For Connor to be ignorant of all this and yet be front-seat at major Revolutionary events is inconceivable. He's supposed to be a little naive, as written in the game. But on the other hand his mentor Achilles and others would know and inform of this. **It's not believable to me on any level and it completely ruins the game's story and guts Connor as a character**. The open-world and optional conversations ruins it even more because in-between missions you can visit Connor's village, the only Native American settlement in the entire game and this political stuff never comes up once. And after you kill Kanento;kon, Connor's native friend so as to prevent a skirmish, you bring his body back and no one says anything. **It's dumb, ugly, dishonest, and one of the best examples of narrative self-destruction this side of \"Martha\"**.\n\nWe also have the issue of **how Washngton is shown in AC3.** He's basically a kind of Disney theme park animatronic, **a bland guy**, who is humble and so on. The game has them calling him out for being a general who never won, which is true. What isn't true is how the game shows his character. As contemporaries and modern historians point out, **the real Washington was a cunning political operator and effortless manipulator**. Cold and aloof, condescending to his peers, **highly image conscious but quite unwilling to suffer fools**. Him taking lip from Haytham and Connor is not concievable. Washington should be **closer to AC1's Richard the Lionheart**. The portrayal of Washington here seems to go back to the 19th Century and the whole \"I won't tell a lie\" thing which the real Washington totally did as and when needed.\n\nThen we come to Haytham and his whole idea that the Founding Fathers are a bunch of white slaveowning oligarchs. AC3 started this idea of Templars being \"gray\" and by that I mean \"comicbook gray\" rather than the real thing. Haytham talking smack about the founders while still supporting the American Revolution because he wants Charles Lee to be the military dictator of America...is again cheesy. **If Haytham cares so much about slavery how come he's friends with William Johnson.** The real Charles Lee having ambitions to be a military dictator is not supported. Anyway, the point is Connor being surprised by the Mohawks being Loyalist, and then by Washington's retaliatory punitive Sullivan Expedition is simply not believable on any historical level. **The entire situation**, complete with Haytham adding the \"washington killed your mom\" thing, **is contrived solely to give Haytham the upper hand here. Doing so this way ends up undercutting the entire story, meaning that there's no story purpose for the rest of the game on any level, fictional and historical.**\n\nThe final part shows us the Battle of Monmouth. This is the last land-battle in the game and once again **I don't know if this is Ubisoft being Canadian (aka Loyalist), but the fact is every on-screen battle of the Patriots shown in AC3 is some kind of messy retreat, glorified skirmish, and not a single victory**. From playing this game cold, you wouldn't be able to understand how the Americans won. Charles Lee's retreat from Monmouth is again like Braddock, he's-an-idiot/he-did-what-he-could as far as military historiography goes. Here the game tells us that Lee is a Templar and so evil. So who cares. We also meet Lafayette and he's basically shown as a nice guy, but again he's kind of shown as a living cartoon like all the American Revolutionaries, and he doesn't look like the young man he was (20 years of age) at the time. He should look younger than Connor at any rate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 10-13, Chesapeake Bay, Finale \\[1778-1783\\]*\n\nThe big historical naval battle is Chesapeake Bay, which I am quite sure wasn't won by a single privateer frigate ramming a man 'o war and single-handedly killing everyone on board. We meet Admiral de Grasse before battle and it's again weird for us to see aristocrats taking orders from someone so far beneath them in social hierarchy in a time and place that mattered a great deal. The big thing about the finale of the American Revolution was the efforts of the French Navy and the French Army, so somehow seeing an American privateer ship winning this seems odd given the whole weight of historical narrative and the reason why the French had to intervene.\n\nThe bombardment of the Fort that Connor orders is stupid. Why is he ordering the bombing of a fort which he is infiltrating anyway, thereby risking death or injury as indeed does happen. Anyway Connor kills Templar Dad. Then later the game ends with Charles Lee's entirely fictional chase and then death at the Inn. The real Lee died at Philadelphia and not in some Frontier town near Monmouth. There are short epilogue cutscenes after the MD is done. The big one is the one showing the British leaving New York harbour and then ending when Connor sees a slave auction. It's a good scene to close the game but not one that the game has fully earned.\n\n**SIDE MISSIONS**\n\nAC3 has a lot of content in side missions with stories. The AC recruits are full characters in a chain of missions in Liberation. Then you have the Homestead which is a bunch of domestic missions. You have anachronistic Frontiersmen tales which I am going to ignore. There's the Captain Kidd Tombs which I'll also ignore. Then you have the Naval Missions where you attack the Templar Nicholas Biddle. I am only going to deal with stuff that touches on history.\n\n1. Naval Missions: Nicholas Biddle is shown in this mission to harass ships to scare the Continental Congress in giving more to the Navy so he can do better. After a while Templar motivations become trite cliches. The real Biddle didn't do any such thing though it is true that the Continental Navy during the Revolution struggled and USS Randolph was their big ship. What is weird though is how the game undersells the violence. In real life the destruction of USS Randolph killed more than 300 on board. Here the game frames it as Biddle asking Connor to destroy it as if a captain must go down with the ship. Yeah because who cares about the 300+ man crew, it's the captain and his vanity that counts.\n2. **One of the Liberation missions**, the one in New York has Jamie Colley, **has you attempting to stop mercenaries spreading smallpox via blankets in the area devastated by the Great Fire**. I find it pretty weird that the developers are **transplanting the actions of Jeffrey Amherst during Pontiac's War** to Loyalist New York. Historians and scientists debate if the blankets was effective as an agent to carry and spread the disease, but that doesn't of course lessen the evil ordered by Amherst. It's just that there's no way this was done in the American Revolution, where there wasn't this ideological hatred. **It's comparable in many instances to transferring Nazi crimes to the British in Roland Emmerich's** ***The Patriot***. The difference is this is based on an actual attempted war crime by a British-Canadian officer only shifted in conflict and choice of victims.\n\n**GENERAL OBSERVATIONS**\n\n\\- **Assassin's Creed III is a mess** of a game and it's interesting for that. It's **ideas were good** but the **execution was bad**. The decision to mash together a prologue with the Seven Years War and the American Revolution to me strikes me as being a very bad one. Mostly because ultimately the gap between the two wars is too big and the story starts, then stops and then starts and then rockets ahead to the finish barely having time for us to take the Revolution in. Ultimately the game should have covered the American Revolution fully from the Boston Massacre to the Treaty of Paris. Or alternatively they should have set this game entirely in the Seven Years War, and show a Native protagonist then. They went with the Revolution because it was...sigh...\"iconic\" and then they were stuck with a period that the developers and writers are clearly not very invested in. **Alternatively, they could have done the game with the Assassins supporting the Loyalists** and the Templars support the American Revolutionaries. **That would have made more logical sense for Connor's character** but **I accept that Ubisoft would have a hard time selling a game where the American Revolution is a bad thing, and also 'the villain'**. So I respect at the least that Ubisoft is not doing what anyone else in their situation wouldn't have.\n\n\\- None of the American Revolutionary figures we see here feel like proper characters. They come off as bores, and without life and colour, and the game is both too reverent whenever they are off-screen and too caricaturish in the general backdrop. **The main problem is that none of the American Revolutionaries are members of the Assassin secret society.** In earlier games, **the Assassins had Machiavelli**, they had Leonardo as an ally. Later games will have Mary Reade, and Unity had Mirabeau. **That kind of world-building immersed us** more in the historical setting and **it made the historical characters accessible to the players, which is one of the purposes of historical fiction** and made the Assassins feel like they are part of that era. I think **Ubisoft got timid** with having an American Revolutionary be associated with something controversial and **so they pulled their punches**. Obviously someone like Washington or Jefferson would be out of the question. But Thomas Paine certainly could have been an ally, and I think Aaron Burr could have been the one guy who would be part of the Assassin brotherhood in this time given his charismatic character, pro-working class attitudes, pro-female suffrage, and his role in ending slavery in New York State. Anyway the end result is that **the Assassins don't feel like they belong in this period** and AC3 doesn't feel like it's part of this large fabric that you get in the other games.\n\n\\- Another big problem however remains the fact that **AC3 is a game with a Native American protagonist but the central character is his white dad**. Haytham is who you start the game with. You build a connection with him in the crucial opening section and in an open-world game that counts for a lot in getting the player to immerse into the game, and transferring from him to Connor is not easy for many. The main plot in Connor's section gives Haytham the best arguments, the best characterization and has him \"win\" even if it is totally contrived. Charles Lee who is the supposed villain and final boss of the game is a terrible character and the resolution at the end is terrible. **Connor spends all his time in white society, only one Mohawk village is there in the game,** and since the resolution is about the American Revolution screwing over his people, the way the game scants them in their own story isn't commendable. **We don't get multiple tribes,** the diversity and different tensions between them, differing views. For instance Connor's issues with Johnson could easily be tied to grudges to the Iroquois Confederacy seeing his village losing some land as acceptable compromise to halt expansion.\n\n\\- Achilles is the only prominent black character and he's not connected in any way to the historical stuff. It's weird because the fact is that a Black Patriot or **an African-American Assassin would actually make more sense than a Mohawk one**. Within the North there were a significant bunch of Black Patriots. There were also a lot of Black Loyalists, runaway slaves who were promised freedom by the English to enlist, and who were more prominent in the Southern theater (and a crucial factor in getting many of the South to side with the Patriots). That would have been a much more interesting and equally gray dynamic than what you get here. As it stands, Connor's Assassin recruits are all white, as are most of the Homestead, most of the crew of The Aquila. AC3 doesn't deny the presence and issue of slavery, but it definitely downplays it heavily.\n\n\\- The portrayal of colonial cities Boston and New York is fictionalized. Developers claimed that they struggled to find reliable stuff about how the cities were like back then. One thing is that the portrayal is pretty sanitized. Especially New York. New York at the time of the Revolution was noted for being dark and seedy and there was a major red light district there and as such we should be seeing prostitutes in the harbour side of both cities. But in AC3, they kind of removed that. And **the sexlessness of the game's rendering of Colonial America is again too cliched and storybook and a waste of a M rated American Revolution game**. This idea that there was no sex or prostitution during the time of the American Revolution is a common one as [this article notes](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/03/were_there_sex_shops_in_the_time_of_george_washington.html):\n\n&gt;George Washington encountered commercial sex in another setting, as general of the Continental Army. During the Revolutionary War, packs of women known as \"camp followers\" assisted the troops with wound care, cooking, laundry, and other services, sometimes including prostitution. Soldiers also slipped out of camp and visited New York's brothels, which they called the \"Holy Ground.\" Venereal disease became so common that the army began deducting pay from afflicted soldiers as punishment.\n\n\\- Boston being bigger and more prosperous looking than New York definitely feels right since that was the case during the Revolution. The Great Fire damaged New York and we only come there in the aftermath so we don't see the city before. I am a little impressed that Ubisoft has made two games with New York in the 1700s (AC3 and Rogue) when obviously a more exciting period would be the late 19th Century (the Gangs of New York era) or the 1920s. Talk about wasting a city. The Frontier is a mash up of the countryside, mashing together mostly bits of Massachussets and New York State. **This is going to be a problem for Ubisoft moving forward in time** especially since a lot of their consumers have a good chance to be from those states. But **the landscape separating Boston and New York cannot be covered by a single guy on foot running through the tree-top and forest cover. I can accept the illusion that you can do that with a medieval city**, if someone has superpowers, I can even accept it for the small upjumped settlements of colonial cities, I cannot accept that for an entire real-life landscape. The tree-running stuff is too Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon for me, and it also kind of feeds into the Mohawk being \"one with nature\" and all that cliche. **This is why GTA fakes their cities precisely so they can sustain an illusion** that a city or a map, can be traversible in a short number of time by one guy. The Animus and stuff so can, becomes harder to accept as an excuse.\n\n\\- **Connor's niceness and general naivete** and having to be whacked on his head by Achilles, his Dad, and all the Templar targets **comes off as a little too redolent of noble savage**, i.e. that someone who is not from \"civilization\" (here being the American settlement) would be pure, uncorrupted, noble and be good. Today, people reject the idea because it implies that the Iroquois or any tribe in any part of the world coded as \"savage\" aren't a civilization in their own right. And the idea that such people were unsophisticated and unaware of politics is plainly insupportable from an anthropological, historical, and human perspective. Connor shouldn't come off as naif.  It's incongruous.\n\n\\- Obviously the naval mechanic in AC3, which I will talk more when I do Black Flag, is too souped-up, and too arcade-y. The game kind of makes it captain-v-captain without any sense of how important the crew, command structure, and chain of command was. We also see Connor being both captain and helmsman when that wasn't necessarily the case and certainly not all the time. Still it's fun and satisfying and it kind of makes an open-world old-style sailing contest feel different from anything else, making you feel like you are sailing in the water. I don't think AC3 represented warfare properly at all in any of its tactics and as for battle recreation it leaves a lot to be desired. **It's interesting that none of the later AC games showed battle scenes again. I mean land-battles.** We don't see any of Caesar's battles in ORIGINS, nor Napoleon in action in UNITY, and ROGUE likewise set in the Seven Years War, doesn't go for big battle setpieces either. So I think that's a lesson Ubisoft learned from AC3.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI will say that compared to The Patriot, AC3 is less offensive historically and less hateful to the British. That's also a low bar. AC3 [is also less into Founders' Chic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/09/founders-chic/302773/) than *Hamilton,* i.e, the familiar cliches with Washington as this Saint, and that slavery is something only Thomas Jefferson did rather than practically everyone, including Hamilton, and that Burr is somehow this Richard III-like figure of hate. **I think the gutsiest thing about AC3 is that it took the American Revolution and made that story into a total downer, and if anything it's a story, that thanks to its great commercial success and popular medium, shed a lot of light on the losers of the American Revolution**. It didn't do it properly, coherently, rationally or satisfactorily. Nor does it make sense or feels dramatically persuasive. But I respect the intent and I think that's the positive redeeming element in this game which makes me respect it more than the Ezio games, leave alone Rogue and Unity.  It's the one AC game that in its story, theme, character takes the side of the truly oppressed, and none of the other games come close aside from the DLC *Freedom Cry,* and the fact that *Freedom Cry* was made into DLC rather than a full game proves the wrong lessons Ubisoft learned from AC3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SOURCES**\n\n1. *Renegade Revolutionary: The Life of General Charles Lee*.
