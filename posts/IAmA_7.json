Watch the vlog to experience various attractions around Tokyo as well as other parts of Japan. My first time in Japan was absolutely unforgettable!\n\nJapanese people are some of the FRIENDLIEST people that I have ever met in my life. I was so intimidated by the vastness of Tokyo. I was especially intimidated by riding and making transfers on the trains. However, everyone was so helpful. The only attitudes that I have encountered while in Japan were from White foreigners. Visiting a place like Japan where people treat you with such kindness was overwhelming. Being in Japan REALLY made me realize how mistreated we as Black Americans are in the United States. My experience in Japan was truly life changing.",

        "text": "[Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/yfdtio/the_chinese_dad_revealed_why_he_hates_cambridge/)\n\nI am a Chinese father who is turning 42 years old next month, and my son who is 11 years old is currently halfway through 6th grade. He is autistic as well as being a gifted boy, getting straight A in numerous subjects, is 2-3 grade levels ahead in many subjects, and has a clear ambition of going to Harvard and MIT. He excels in many subjects, including science, technology (computers, computer science), math, geography (he won 1st place in the Geography Bee at school and is obsessed with looking at the globe), social science, history, as well as the piano (he self taught several classical pieces including some Debussy, Chopin, Beethoven, and Mozart sonatas), and he gets straight A in his 6th grade courses and he also gets Ann A+ in math (he is above grade level, meaning he is in 7th grade instead of 6th). Not only does he have ambition of going to an Ivy League, he is working his real best to get there (he has been comparing colleges based on their average SAT scores, he has been looking for colleges based on their rankings per USNews, he has been watching videos of people with perfect SATs, and even the schools that send the most students to Ivy League on PolarisList). My wife and I make 200 thousand a year after taxes (take home pay) and in 2014, we bought our Worcester house (1500 sqft) for 200 thousand and pay 1000 a month by the way. Also, after self teaching himself Algebra last year and geometry this fall, he is teaching himself trigonometry, and also learning high school level physics, biology, chemistry, history, as well as several CS programming languages on edX. He is extremely ambitious by the way.\n\nSince he saw that schools in Boston send the most students to Ivy League and there are a lot of feeder schools closer to Boston, he really wants to move to Boston for a better education. Some of his top choice schools are Boston University Academy, Boston College High School, Buckingham Browne and Nichols School, Roxbury Latin School, Belmont Hill School, Noble and Greenough School, Commonwealth School, and Malden Catholic High School and Matignon High School as backup schools. Plus, since my 75 year old uncle and aunt lives in North Quincy (they live as a couple in a 1500 sqft house over there and that house has 4 bedrooms), he might be able to live there for free since they do have a guest room of which visitors could sleep at their house maybe 4-5 per year, but instead, that guest room could be retrofitted as my son's room. Even though my wife and I make a combined net income of 200k a year as I work as a manager at Abbvie in Worcester and soon, I might get promoted to business director, I am willing to do Uber or Doordash or Fiverr to support my family just like my coworker (who also lives in Holden and is also Asian), and in 2014, I bought a 1500 sqft single house in Worcester for 200k and even though I originally paid 1250 a month, I put in some extra money, and hence, we only need to pay 1000 a month.\n\nSince I wanted to upgrade from the 1500 sqft house in Worcester to a 3-4 thousand sqft house in Holden, Paxton, or Sterling between 700 and 1 million, I told my son that I can't 'afford' a house in Boston, even though my son went to Zillow and found out that there are many houses in Boston that are bigger than my house in Worcester within my price range (even in places like Medford, Quincy, Arlington, Watertown, and even Belmont, where 1 million can get a 1500 sqft house), and he then got mad at me. He does not want a big house and instead, wanted a great education, but I told him that he can get a great education at Wachusett and Mountview Middle School as well as Saint Johns High School. He has been dreaming of moving to Boston ever since he was 7 years old in 2018, mostly for a better education, but I told him that I 'can't afford it' and plus, Boston has too much traffic. He started to argue that while Boston and Worcester are very diverse, Holden is an 'incredibly white town and rural' and he doesn't want to live in a white and rural town and instead, loves big cities (he went to open houses there and he didn't like it since it is too rural for him). I told him that BC High and BU Academy are too expensive, and instead, wanted to buy a 700-1 million dollar house in Holden, Paxton, or Sterling, buy a Tesla Model Y for me as well as a Honda CR-V EX-L AWD for my wife this June, and trade in my 2010 Honda Accord EX and my wife's 2012 Honda Civic LX when buying these cars, and then send him to Saint Johns in 2024, but then, he got mad at me.\n\nAlso, my niece (his cousin) who was born in December 2009 (19 months older than him as he was born in July 2011) is less academically talented than him and less of a high achiever (she is only an above average student) and is going to move from China to Boston to go to private school at Winsor School next year, and after somebody told him about this, he then got mad at me and my wife, knowing he is academically talented, and plus, he is ambitious go getting into a prestigious university.\n\nI am scared by not sending him to Boston to live with my uncle and aunt and instead, buy a 3500 sqft house in Sterling, Paxton, or Holden (he is a Chinese autistic boy who is very geeky and academically talented, getting straight A in every subject except for English and PE of which he gets A- in those classes), but a Tesla Model Y as well as a Honda CR-V and in 2027, buy a RAM 1500 as a third car for myself even though I barely do manual labour, and send him to Saint Johns for high school, he not only would get mad at us for not sending him to Boston for a better education, but also be jealous at his cousin and develop an unhealthy obsession with her down the road since she got to move to Boston and live by herself at 13 years 9 months old, despite being less academically talented than him, not needing to go to the Ivy League as much, and having less great ambitions (he really dreams of being the next multi-millionaire in tech while my niece only wants to be a pediatrist, open her own clinic, as well as go to a more regular college). Also, my son really wanted to move to Boston ever since he was 7 in 2018 knowing Boston has some of the best schools in the world, while my niece (he met her during a family trip to China in 2019) has only heard of Boston since she was 10 and only expressed desires to move there at age 12 in 2021.\n\nSince my son got bullied by several classmates at his Worcester elementary school, I am scared if we were to send him to Saint Johns, some of his elementary school friends might know him and bully him at Saint Johns and especially since this is high school, months after he enters Saint Johns, he might get bullied and teased by the entire school and might not thrive there, ending him up at a more regular school like UMass Lowell and UMass Boston and Worcester State while my niece since she gots to Winsor School in Boston and lives on her own, she might get into a better university than him and if that is the case, in 2027, when she starts college, my son might end up being very jealous and have a terrible obsession with my niece (that is if we didn't let him move to Boston and insisted that he stay in the 3500 sqft beautiful house). I was scared by sending him to Wachusett, he might not be academically challenged like he did in Worcester and he might get bored with schools, and because he always would hit the ceiling, he might not get the best education and might end up getting bored with the school system, which meant he would end up going to a more regular school like UMass Lowell, University of New Hampshire, UMass Boston, UMass Dartmouth, or Worcester State, and he might be angry at me and my wife after finding out that my niece is at a better position than him and he might get jealous of his cousin since she is less academically talented buy ends up outperforming him because we refused to support his education.\n\nWe looked for houses in Holden such as 12 Wagner Ln and 20 Wagner Ln in Summer 2021, but after returning home from the open house, my son got angry at me and stated 'why did you buy this house instead of a good education for me, I dream of getting into Harvard, Holden is a rural area and therefore, it is hard to get into a good university since it is further from Boston than Worcester is to Boston and good universities wouldn't know the school well since it is far from the city'. After he got mad at us since we made a terrible decision to him, we held back on buying the house and I truly regretted listening to him since this house is so beautiful and he would get very good neighbors and plus, the house is affordable enough, as I can't afford a house in Boston since houses in Boston cost at least 1 and a half million.\n\nAlso, from what I heard from my sister, she will send my niece from Boston to Shanghai by plane in June of 2024 after finishing 9th grade via Doha by herself, then she will sleep at a luxury hotel in Doha by herself for one night and travel around Doha by herself, and then return home. I am scared that with this statement and these intentions, my son would be very jealous of his cousin since he would argue that 'Why is she less smart than me, she doesn't do well at school, yet, not only gets to go to Boston and live by herself even though I have been asking you to send me to Boston since 2018 and she only knew of Boston since 2019, but also get to travel by herself and have too much freedom' 'Why her and not me'? He might complain about how privileged my niece is an he might get jealous, but still, I ignore all of his requests.\n\nI am so mad at him and just want to kick him out of the home or send him to a mental hospital or to foster home since he took my house away in favor of his desires to live in Boston. I told him that Boston has too much traffic and that I cannot afford a house in Boston. If I didn't listen to this sick and crazy boy, I could have bought a house in September in 2021, bought two cars, send him to Saint Johns, and bought a third car several years later for myself to enjoy my life. When my son doesn't appreciate that I worked hard for him (I take him on vacation around America every summer buy not to other countries and give him presents every Christmas and red lucky money every New Year), I would tell him: When I come home, a dog at least runs to me and pats me and loves me. You should be as smart as a dog and appreciate that I work hard for you.\n\nTurns out, my son is correct.\n\nWe put a deposit on a 3500 sqft house in Sterling MA (near Holden) last November and purchased it for 700k in December. Since we qualify for lower interest loans and that I put down 200k for the house, we ended up only needing to pay around $3750 a month for the house. We moved there and my son was not very happy about that (it was New Year's Day when we moved and he was transferred to Mountview Middle School in Holden from an elementary school in Worcester since Chocksett didn't accept him as Chocksett couldn't accommodate autistic students). 2 January was his first day at school and at Mountview, he was immediately assigned to a special education homeroom which made him angry at us (he used to be in a regular homeroom at his elementary school but since he has autism, he has to be assigned to a special ed homeroom, which segregated him from regular students). Because he is Chinese as well as being in special ed due to him having autism, he was bullied from day one at that school, being bullied now by several of his acquaintances, with almost all of his acquaintances being white with a handful of African American and Latino people and very few Asians with him being the only Chinese in his 6th grade.\n\nThat made him really angry at us because he thinks that we are shoving his education to the ground. When he was in Worcester, he was in all regular classes except for lunch every week when he is in Lunch Bunch but he still didn't like it and thrived more in his advanced math course than in Lunch Bunch but by the time we moved to Sterling, basically half of his day was at a special ed room and basically his whole school day was with special education students.\n\nEven though he is very gifted in math and is self teaching himself trigonometry and got an A+ in 6th grade math last year with him getting A+ in the first two quarters of 7th grade math, this school pulled him back to 6th grade math by the way, which upsetted me so much. He is even placed in special ed math, meaning he could learn at half the pace of regular students (regular students are now in Chapter 6, he is only in Chapter 3 now, which made me very confused and angry).\n\nAs for his special education, not only is he placed in a special ed homeroom, away from regular students and towards students with autism and learning disabilities, which he doesn't like and which he didn't have to deal with at his Worcester School, he also takes special ed math and special ed English as well, and he takes a class called Tutorial, geared towards Special Ed students and learning disabled students. The only regular/gen-ed classes he gets to take are Science, World Geography, Music, Art, and Gym, but for all these classes, he has to have an escort go with him and he has to be with special ed students, which made him really really angry, and makes him labeled as autistic, hence, many of his peers bullied him right from the start (some of his male peers start introducing him to inappropriate stuff like porn as well as sexy girls and his male peers even brainwashed him stating that some of his female peers have smoked cannabis and smoke cocaine by the way, which made my son really really angry).\n\nI did contact the school about accommodating him correctly such as placing him in more appropriate classes like 7th grade math/Algebra and all regular courses like he did at his old school, but they refused to accommodate him saying he isn't 'academically gifted and has learning disabilities' even though he clearly doesn't have any learning disabilities as demonstrated by his academic prowess at his old school. I even contacted the school admins asking them to prevent the bullying from happening, but instead of trying to crackdown the bullying, they let the bullying continue, and instead, scapegoat him, blaming that he caused the problems, and he ended up in detention at least 2-3 times per week which upset not only him, but also my wife and I. They basically allowed the bullying to happen while punishing him as well as not letting his education thrive by refusing to challenge him like the school in Worcester, and instead, putting him with the group of learning disabled students and making him learn stuff at a lower pace, which makes all of us sad.\n\nIn fact, my son does have an iPhone (we bought him an iPhone SE 3 as his first phone and we also bought a MacBook Air for him due to him wanting to develop mobile applications due to his passion in technology), but he does not yet have a SIM card due to us not wanting to give him a SIM card until he is 13 years old (essentially, he uses the phone kind of like an iPod touch), but even though more than half of his classmates have smartphones (many of his classmates use phones like the iPhone XR, 11, 12, 13, Samsung Galaxy S10, S20, S21, etc), the vice principal (Mr. McCarthy) (who still uses an iPhone 5S), has an issue with my son using a smartphone and especially his passion with technology (whenever he goes to detention, he meets this vice principal and not Mrs. Hughes or Mr. Githmark). Even though students are allowed to use their phone at the courtyard before school starts, for some reason, on Wednesday January 11 (even though my son was complying with school regulations), my son had to be pulled to the office, which basically spells an end to his satisfaction with the school.\n\nAfter Mr. McCarthy called him to the office arbitrarily, my son's iPhone gets taken away for no reason (he wasn't doing anything wrong at school and was just watching a Veritasium video) after Mr. McCarthy called the police on him and Mr. McCarthy and the Holden police both agreed that my son can have no phone or computer and they basically wanted to put an end to my son's passion in technology. We got the phone back today and the police accused my son of looking up stuff of 'how to make a bomb', 'how to murder people', and 'Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer' even though he doesn't even have any of these intentions and doesn't want to do any of these (I know that my son is very good and that he loves looking at technology videos and computer science videos as well as educational videos), and I do believe that the Holden police and Mr. McCarthy are being discriminatory towards him and they wanted to harass him since not only is he Asian, he was also diagnosed with autism as well, meaning that he is a double whammy, in a town where 90% of people are Caucasian.\n\nOver the past 10 days, the Holden and Sterling police have put us in surveillance and they even monitored our actions, browsing history, etc, to see if my son is on the computer, and it really scared me so much that I just wanted to sell down the house at a loss. Police are basically trying to harass and stalk my son and they basically monitored him of what he does at school and even at our private property just due to us being Asian-American, which made us want to abandon the Wachusett region. In fact, Holden and Sterling Police came to my house this Monday and threatened to arrest my son and put him down the ground, causing a ton of trauma, and they even threatened to silence me as well as my wife up, locking us in one of the rooms in my house, while being very discriminatory against my wife and I and it is causing massive headache for the whole family now. The Holden and Sterling police are both very hostile towards us and basically, just want us to get out of the town or get arrested. The police harassment continues to today, where I went to Big Y before work, but then was interrogated by Holden police, which made me want to leave the town because they are currently spying us like a police state, more like China than the US, to try to suppress dissidents.\n\nI am curious what I should do now since I have finally realized that the words my son said are correct and that moving to a predominantly white town while my son has autism and is Chinese is not a good idea? Should I just sell down my house at a loss and just move to another city or should I stay there and allow police to harass us the entire time we are there? Plus, one more note is that on the 11th, my son was suspended from school for two days while also not having access to a phone or computer just because he was sanctioned from the school for no reason even though he was not the bully but rather the victim of school oppression (he wasn't ever suspended and instead, actually was praised by his previous school up until the day he left his previous school in Christmas of last year).",

        "text": "PROOF: https://i.redd.it/s3cnsz6sz8da1.jpg\n\nFor more than a decade, a training program known as 911 call analysis and its methods have spread across the country and burrowed deep into the justice system. By analyzing speech patterns, tone, pauses, word choice, and even grammar, practitioners believe they can identify “guilty indicators” and reveal a killer.\n\nThe problem: a consensus among researchers has found that 911 call analysis is scientifically baseless. The experts I talked to said using it in real cases is very dangerous. Still, prosecutors continue to leverage the method against unwitting defendants across the country, we found, sometimes disguising it in court because they know it doesn’t have a reliable scientific foundation.\n\nIn reporting [this series](https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-fbi-police-courts), I found that those responsible for ensuring honest police work and fair trials — from police training boards to the judiciary — have instead helped 911 call analysis metastasize. It became clear that almost no one had bothered to ask even basic questions about the program.\n\n[Here’s the story](https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-jessica-logan-evidence) I wrote about a young mother in Illinois who was sent to prison for allegedly killing her baby after a detective analyzed her 911 call and then testified about it during her trial. For instance, she gave information in an inappropriate order. Some answers were too short. She equivocated. She repeated herself several times with “attempts to convince” the dispatcher of her son’s breathing problems. She was more focused on herself than her son: I need my baby, she said, instead of I need help for my baby. [Here’s a graphic that shows how it all works](https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-jessica-logan-evidence#audio-tool). \nThe program’s chief architect, Tracy Harpster, is a former cop from Ohio with little homicide investigation experience. The FBI helped his program go mainstream. When I talked to him last summer, Harpster defended 911 call analysis and noted that he has also helped defense attorneys argue for suspects’ innocence. He makes as much as $3,500 — typically taxpayer funded — for each training session. \n\nHere are the stories I wrote:\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-jessica-logan-evidence\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-fbi-police-courts\n\nIf you want to follow my reporting, text STORY to 917-905-1223 and ProPublica will text you whenever I publish something new in this series.

My anxiety was so bad, I could barely drag myself out of bed. \n \nI learned everything I teach to millions of fans and followers the hard way: by first screwing up my own life, and out of necessity discovering the tools and research that transformed my life and got me to where I am today.\n \nIf I can go from nearly a million dollars in debt, marinating in depression and self-pity, to where I am now, so can you. I figure if I can save you some of the headaches and heartaches I’ve given myself, that’s a life well lived.\n \nMy work has been translated into 41 languages and includes the New York Times Bestseller The High 5 Habit, The 5 Second Rule, six #1 audiobooks, and one of the most viewed TEDx talks in the world.\n \nSo Ask Me Anything – and don’t let the fact that I’m a 54 year old woman with 3 grown kids have you censor the questions, challenges, or problems that you are facing. Just be respectful and get ready, because I’ll give you the answer, especially if you’re not ready to hear it.\n \nProof: https://i.redd.it/kp1gowh8dnca1.jpg",
