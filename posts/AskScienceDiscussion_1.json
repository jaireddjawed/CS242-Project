        "text": "I know that this is an ultra-classical question, so it's not like an original one or anything. \n\nBut there seem to be a couple main questions about consciousness and the brain. \n\nFirst, are there particular sites in the brain that \"build\" consciousness? Such that knocking out these particular sites \"turns off\" consciousness? How \"specific\" are those sites? \n\nSecond, these sites (if they exist) must receive information from throughout the entire brain, right? So how is it that altering receptors or chemicals or synapses or circuits in (e.g.) the prefrontal cortex produces one particular change in consciousness as opposed to another? Suppose you take an ADHD medication and it suddenly \"turns on\" your prefrontal cortex; what accounts for why the alteration of whatever information the prefrontal cortex is supplying produces the particular change-in-consciousness X that the alternation produces? \n\nI'm sure there are many more interesting questions. And I think that anesthesiologists study consciousness, interestingly enough. See here: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction\n\n&gt;Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) is a theory which postulates that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons, rather than the conventional view that it is a product of connections between neurons. The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules. It is proposed that the theory may answer the hard problem of consciousness and provide a mechanism for free will.[1] The hypothesis was first put forward in the early 1990s by Nobel laureate for physics, Roger Penrose, and anaesthesiologist and psychologist Stuart Hameroff. The hypothesis combines approaches from molecular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, philosophy, quantum information theory, and quantum gravity.[2][3]",

It seems to me that laymen typically expect \"species\" to be an equivalence relation, so isn't this a better definition?\n\nI get that species may not be the right level - there's certainly appropriate desire to do more fine-grained classification.  Maybe family - that's where Felidae sits, and I would guess that all cats would be the same family by this definition as well.  But some level of classification should have this definition, right?\n\nThere are some adjustments that could be made to account for animals that don't require sexual reproduction, but that's kind of outside the scope of my question.",

The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The chitin walls of the hollow bristles form a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped photonic crystal; the hexagonal holes are 0.51 μm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 diffraction gratings, making Aphrodita one of the most iridescent of marine organisms.”\n\nMy question is how structurally, one would create a pearlescent (instead of reflecting certain colours it reflects mostly white light) version of these bristles in I guess hair.

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo, I find space stuff fascinating, I love hearing about the concepts and our interpretations of them; but I'm -not- a math guy.  The equations for physics just go right over my head, even though I did try studying them in college.\n\nSo, in the last few weeks/months NASA announced James Webb had found galaxies that formed closer to 100 million years after the Big Bang, which contradicts our previous information, we thought the first stars would be around 100 Million years, but Galaxies would've taken about 1 Billion - 2 Billion to form.  Now, with James Webb, we realized the Galaxies were forming in the time-frame we had expected individual Stars to be forming, putting us off by 10-20x the reality of what happened in those early stages of the universe.\n\nSo, I was curious what the ramifications of this are.\n\nFirst of all, were these conclusions we had that were off - were they based out of Relativity?  Was that the basic equation they inserted and then made their prediction about Galaxies forming around 1-2 billion years in?\n\nIf it was, would this be the first case of Relativity being insufficient, when dealing with large scales?  Relativity has issues with syncing up with Quantum Mechanics, but outside of that, its been correct the entire time, for over 100 years now, right?\n\nSo - again, I don't know how they come to these conclusions, but if relatively was the basis for the prediction that Galaxies would be in the first 1-2 Billion years of the universe; then that means Relativity was \"off\" by a factor of up to 10x - 20x.  They thought the first solo Stars were forming around 100 million years in; and it looks like we totally missed the bullseye and 100 million years, there weren't just stars, there were galaxies.  \n\nWe expected them to form at 1 Billion years old would be off by a factor of 10x, up to their prediction of it being 2 billion years, making it 20x off their predictions.  \n\nIf relativity was the basis for these predictions - Does that mean we have a new data point to potentially extrapolate the Relativity equation? \n\nIs there a chance we could we be seeing a new theory that incorporates this new information into Relativity in the next few years?\n\nI want to be clear - I'm no scientist, I am a layman, so this entire post may be under false pretenses and me totally misunderstanding the situation; but I just wanted to know what effects this discovery will have on our interpretation of any form of physics, whether its relativity, whether its a underestimation of the force of Gravity, etc.\n\nSome articles on the subject, other sites had really annoying pop ups.\n\nThanks for your time folks.  Hope your day goes well.  \n\n[https://www.space.com/11386-galaxies-formation-big-bang-hubble-telescope.html](https://www.space.com/11386-galaxies-formation-big-bang-hubble-telescope.html)\n\n[https://www.livescience.com/jwst-early-universe-discoveries](https://www.livescience.com/jwst-early-universe-discoveries)",

        "text": "Hi all, this is a bit of a weird question relating to the geometry of a 3-sphere. Askscience says no hypothetical questions, idk if this falls under that but if you think I could stick this there after all let know. Most of the context relates to this video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiGe2x8t6mA\n\nThe key takeaway is this: In a hyperspherical space, you essentially see objects at your antipode - OR should nothing be there, yourself - as though it were at d=0 IE right up in your face. In the case of seeing yourself, the image is inverted.\n\nMy concern, however, is that this doesn't strictly apply in a practical use case. For simplicity, consider an observer looking out from an illuminated, spherical earth that does not move in space or rotate, in an otherwise empty 3-sphere universe. Indeed, the observer should see the earth itself, the light having looped all the way around the universe and back again. However, the image you see is NOT your antipode('s antipode), rather it is the opposite side of the planet.\n\nMy assumption is that therefore the image would not appear to be at d=0 but rather more like d=earth's diameter, at least in the centre while the 'edge' of the image appears closer (d=earth radius?), thus overall appearing concave, and visible in the centre of the sky (and occupying most of it) from any point on the planet. You do see a concave effect in the video, and additionally I downloaded the program used and attempted to recreate the described conditions, but the positioning is not very precise and I can't vouch for the program's accuracy so I find myself uncertain of my conclusion. Can anyone more mathematically knowledgeable please verify my assumptions and/or explain why I am wrong?\n\nAnd a follow-up, if you'll forgive me: Consider instead a *moving* planet (you know, like one that orbits a star). Given that the speed of light is not instantaneous, by the time it completes the universal lap the planet will be in a different position from the duplicate. My assumption here is that if the offset exceeds the earth's diameter the duplicate will appear 'normal' IE convex and not inverted, and only visible if you're looking in the right direction namely towards your original position. Is that correct? If so, what if the offset is *less* than the size of the planet such that it is overlapped with the position of the apparent duplicate? Normal at the extremities, but inverted and concave within the overlapping zone...?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/11ijack/is_receptor_internalization_known_to_be_a_cause/",
        "text": "I'm currently dealing with an interesting (and very high-stakes, for me) situation where a drug worked for a week (on two separate occasions; in each case it worked for about one week) and then stopped working. I contacted a researcher who suggested that the reason for this tolerance might be receptor internalization (mediated by beta-arrestin signaling) that causes alpha-2A receptors to \"hide away\". The researcher said: \n\n&gt;The speculation would be that the lithium might stop the internalization of the alpha-2A adrenoceptors--so fingers crossed! The research on medications fizzling out is likely very hard to do, because there are probably many many different causes. The research on executive function being mediated by the prefrontal cortex has been shown with lesion studies (humans and animals with lesions to the PFC have deficits in executive function), with physiological recordings in animals, and with stimulation studies. For example, there is an old study showing that TMS to weaken the right dlPFC impairs impulse control: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.469.9454&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf. \n\n&gt;Your issue with guanfacine is likely due to your alpha-2A receptors \"hiding away\" from being stimulated so much, causing tolerance. You can try going up to the 4mg dose if your doctor agrees--many adult-sized people take that dose. If the same thing happens with that dose, you could try taking immediate-release guanfacine in the morning, and see if it wears off by nighttime and allows your receptors to come back into the membrane. But that is very speculative. \n\n&gt;Receptors sit on the plasma membrane, where they are stimulated by neurotransmitters (or drugs that mimic them). But mother nature often has protective negative feedback mechanisms. So, if a receptor is receiving high levels of stimulation, it is often internalized under the membrane so the transmitter can no longer stimulate it. The internalization is mediated by something called beta-arrestin signaling. Scientists are working on developing drugs that can engage a receptor without activating beta-arrestin, but it is tough!\n\nAnd I had a thought: Maybe scientists will start to work on a drug that brings the receptors back out into the membrane. I guess that being able to undo the internalization would be just as useful as being able to prevent it in the first place. \n\nBut I simply don't know what the situation is. \n\nIs receptor internalization an actual known cause of drug tolerance? \n\nWhen it comes to guanfacine, what are the possible hypotheses as to why it might stop working (I hope that there are at least some hypotheses)? \n\nAre scientists working on ways to either prevent or undo receptor-internalization? \n\nThanks and sorry for the unusual and complicated post. It's certainly scientifically interesting. And again, for me my whole life depends on this stuff.",

When I'm lying down and feeling unusually relaxed, when I have my eyes closed, it also feels like I'm floating - but I have never seen my own face or anything in my room without opening my eyes.\n\nThere are people though, who report seeing things in the real world, that actually happened, without using their eyes - as if their soul has left their body. As far as I know this hasn't been scientifically confirmed.\n\nSee: https://psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk/articles/aware-nde-study\n\n&gt; AWARE is a large-scale study carried out between 2008 and 2015 in an attempt to draw veridical information from hospital patients who reported having had a near-death experience.\n\nWhat would you examine next, *if* you had multiple people who have been \"unconscious\" (in a sense) and close to death reporting seeing things that actually exist in the real world, that they couldn't have seen with their eyes?\n\nIt seems like magic, but you can also examine magic scientifically. It only true \"magic\" if you just give up examining it further. There is a fanfiction \"Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality\", where Harry does experiments on magic.\n\nElectricity was once very mysterious as well, before people started rigorously examining it.\n\n--------\n\nI would maybe try to replicate the near-death experience on rats, because it's morally *more* defensible to intentionally induce cardiac arrest on a rat, than on a human.\n\nCreate two fenced in areas that you can only see in from above. Place some food in one of the areas. The rat leaves it's body and can see which one has food. When the rat has entered it's body again, it can chose to enter one of the fenced in areas and it chooses the correct one.\n\nYou could then research what *exactly* induces the out of body experience, by varying the method and you could do brain scans to see if the brain area responsible for visual perception is active during the out-of-body experience or not.\n\nSimilar experiments were actually done to research the effect of placebos, to see at which exact point the \"fake\" medicine is connected to a real effect.

This lakebed has to contain worthwhile amounts of precious and sci-fi relevant materials, while also containing extremely hazardous particulates that are constantly airborne from a violent and persistent wind that blows into the basin. Ideally, the air quality is so poor and saturated with these particulates that it is nearly impossible to see through the tint in the air (which is hopefully red, orange, or yellow). \n\nThis air has to not only be unbreathable but corrosive to human skin to the point that even short exposure to the concentrations out on the lakebed will result in a quick but painful (and grotesque) death. Additionally, it must also be reactive enough to cause a large explosion when it comes into contact with fire (the wind gets in the refinery and the refinery blows up, long (short) story)\n\nAs the title says, is there a scenario in which it’s plausible that there would exist mass quantities of both extremely valuable and extremely hazardous and reactive materials in the same area, and particularly a dry lakebed or salt flat? And if yes, what would they be? If it’s any help, I’m aiming for ‘plausible’ sci-fi: meaning I have no problems with an extremely low likelihood or that the “lake” used to be filled with mercury or whatever, I just don’t want to have to invent an element or elements lol.\n\nIf you can help, thank you so much!",

Because it started and ended so abruptly, it has served as an unplanned experiment in human health. Pregnant women, it turns out, were uniquely vulnerable, and the children they gave birth to have been influenced by famine throughout their lives.\n\nMy understanding of epigenetics is from the perspective of  the Dutch \"Hunger Winter\" when the Nazis starved the Dutch of food. This led babies that were invitro during to naturally crave excess calories later in life. So it's clear if a baby is invitro during periods of starvation the body will respond to encourage it to search out extra sustenance once it is born.\n\nWould anyone here tell me other real-life examples of epigenetics notably impacting those who were invitro or raised during  (good or bad) unique periods?",

        "text": "Was in a discussion about wanting clean energy. I said we need more nuclear energy plants. The other person brought up the danger of nuclear meltdown. I said in the decades of history of 100s of nuclear power plants around the world there had been only one nuclear meltdown -- Chernobyl. She mentioned Fukushima. I argued that I didn't think Fukushima was a meltdown, and that \"meltdown\" was just a scary word people throw out to rile up fear of nuclear energy.\n\nThat conversation got me looking into the term, \"meltdown\". It seems that the term isn't actually defined in any useful way; or isn't *used* in any useful way. A few attempts at searching for nuclear meltdowns through Google shows that most sites/media/people equate any accident (or even just a scare) at a nuclear facility as a meltdown. And even when there are deaths or injuries from these \"meltdowns\", it seems most (all non-Chernobyl?) are from non-nuclear causes (steam, fire, etc. -- 2 *drown* at Fukushima).\n\nLooking at the Wikipedia list of \"Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents\": Only 4 of the 28 listed mention \"meltdown\" as a thing that happened. But later in the article, where \"nuclear meltdown\" is defined, there are 15+ meltdowns listed.\n\n**My overall questions here are: Is there an official definition of what a meltdown is, and how many have there been in the history of nuclear energy generation?**",

We are told that photons do not have mass as nothing with mass can reach the speed of light. (The Penn Rose diagram illustrates the connection between space and time and depicts how c is the speed limit of the universe; a limit only reachable by massless particles.) Obviously photons have energy as without their energy life could not exist, the CMB could not exist, and energetic reactions like fusion in stars wouldn't be required to create them.\n\nPhotons can also 'push' things through spacetime in the forms of  'solar wind' and 'laser propulsion'. Additionally they can deform spacetime creating gravity as the hypothetical 'kugelblitz' shows us. Lastly photons in their massless glory are able to interact with matter fairly easily whereas neutrinos do have mass and very very rarely interact with anything. If photons don't have mass why are they able to be stopped by mass?\n\nVery curious for answers, it vexes me how an energetic and massless particle can even exist in a universe where matter is energy.",

They have the money they need, an experienced &amp; professional cast &amp; crew, and access to all the resources they need to make a film. Yet, sometimes, they make terrible films. Then critiques and fans, who don't have most of these resources, do an excellent job explaining why this didn't work, a lot of which could've been fixed in the filmmaking process.\n\nSo, outside of human error and some bad actors writing these in bad faith to appeal to their own biases, how and why do these \"bad studies\" exist?\n\n(One explanation I could come up with is the pressure the scientist have to create a paper from start to finish, while the only job of peer reviewers is to peer review.

Human testing has not yet started, so some of my questions are somewhat hypothetical, while others deal with how opioids work in general. \n\nMost of my research has come from this article:\n\n[https://heal.nih.gov/news/stories/OUD-vaccine](https://heal.nih.gov/news/stories/OUD-vaccine)\n\nFrom my understanding, antibodies clinging to the opioids prevent them from entering the brain, eliminating the drug's pleasurable effects. For the opioid to block out pain, it must reach the brain leading me to wonder the following: Would an opioid vaccine prevent the use of opioid-based medicine for pain relief? Would treatment with these medicines still be effective? \n\nThe other factor I’m curious about is what would happen if you kept using higher doses of opioids, seeking to get the pleasurable effects. Could you still overdose on opioids after receiving the vaccine? Specifically, could you cause an overdose by consuming a large amount of opioids without them reaching the brain? \n\nPlease feel free to correct anything I may have misunderstood. I’m also open to hearing other repercussions of this type of vaccine that you can think of. Thanks!",

        "text": "I initially thought this to be a plausible reality of genetic mutation, whereby mutations randomly arise, but in a manner presumed to benefit the organism. As I have come to find out, this claim is very unsubstantiated in modern evolutionary biology. *But*, I found a fairly recent study that insists mutation bias is a greater causal mechanism for evolution than it has largely been believed to be. ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04269-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04269-6)) The potential ramifications of this study are great, enough to make Thomas Kuhn roll in his grave screaming about a paradigm shift.\n\nBut my question is this: could it be plausible that mutations are biased to benefit an organism as a result of that organism's perception or cognition? This would of course mean that natural selection is not the only process that facilitates the evolutionary fitness of an organism, and instead, the mutational process itself corresponds to fitness as well.\n\nMy reason for speculating that evolution somehow corresponds to perception and/or cognizance lies within the existence of the Venus flytrap. I find it greatly insufficient to accept that the first predatory plant that evolved to eat insects evolved in such a way by chance. At the very least, it had to have been aware of the fact that insects exist. This same premise can be applied to a plethora of other evolved lifeforms and functional traits of those lifeforms, such as the earliest plants evolving to contain leaves that absorb sunlight. It seems so absurd to think that there were many different plant organisms randomly mutating redundant features until one happened to luck out and figure out a leaf makes it live better. Furthermore, the fact that younger generations are evolving horn-like structures in the back of their skull to support a difference in common head posturing (which I'll admit is certainly more theoretical than not) also seems to suggest mutational bias ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21625-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21625-1)). (Also, I believe plants possess a form of consciousness, but I don't believe this is a necessary premise to accept for one to agree with the theoretical outline I present. Plants perceive and behave, which may be enough.)\n\nI know this is an open ended question with no evident answer as of yet, but I wish to receive feedback on whether this hypothetical premise could be plausible. We know that psychological facets are inheritable and such, but can psychological factors (or more truthfully, neuroscientific factors) extend to be a causal process for evolutionary mutation? I believe it can, and I hope to see research open up in this domain.",

        "text": "I am a common guy, not very well versed in Sciences. I didn't know about anything but for sometime I have been coming across articles that mention something like 'replication crisis'. I went to Wiki and apparently, nowadays in medicine and social sciences like Psychology, the entire field is going through a replication crisis where most of the research cannot be replicated. It is either difficult or impossible. That means one of the core foundations of scientific philosophy - peer review and replication - is apparently gone in these fields. \n\nI am not gonna talk about the recent pandemic because it is controversial but I have been seeing a lot of articles online and in magazines that have very conflicting advice. Some say that mustard oil, a common cooking oil in India, is harmful, while others say it's very healthy. (Medicine)\nSome say parents need to be friendly with their children, especially adolescents and teenagers, while others say that parents need to be a guardian, not like a 'friend' to their children. (Psychology)\n\nSo how, as a layman, can I trust the scientific community especially about social sciences like Psychology, and medicine (which is such an important subject) given such a fundamental crisis?",

        "text": "In the civilization of which I'm a member, the nod is a logical \"true\" and  the head shake is a logical \"false\" (with a couple of subtle exceptions). \n\nFor animals from birds to polar bears to domestic cats and dogs, the head shake (as a faster movement than for humans) appears to correspond to \"finish\". \n\nIIRC, bird examples were seen in a documentary on antarctic birds including penguins. The polar bear example was seen in a documentary related to an Arctic excursion. The bear seemingly manifested its lack of patience with people taking photos. After shaking its head, it turned around and defalcated towards the public. \n\n* example: just now, our cat peed against the wall which he knows is not allowed. He then had the expected \"soft\" punishment which is to be put nose to the marking while held by the scruff of the neck, and to receive a light spank laterally against the hindquarters. He then shook his head which signifies the end of punishment and resumption of trustful and amical relations with the household. \n\nCould anyone kindly add another example of the head-shake involving a different species in a different situation?\n\nIs the head-shake specific to non-aquatic species and is the origin of this most useful inter-species \"convention\" understood?\n\nBTW I did take a look around and found the following article on Researchgate:\n\n* https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344860731_Why_do_we_shake_our_heads_On_the_origin_of_the_headshake/link/5f941aac299bf1b53e408a74/download\n\nMuch of the article is built around an infant communicating a state of satiety, either for meals or for breastfeeding. It talks about humans and monkeys and other mammals, but makes no mention of birds. \n\nIts of note that when a primate shakes its head, the nose and mouth move laterally, whereas others —felines, canines, birds etc—  rotate the head  with the nose immobile and the eyes move around on the rotational axis.",
