I have an assignment to find a job that I'd qualify for, analyze it, write a resume tailored for it. The class is mostly juniors. Well, I'm a freshman. I have no skills, so my professor said to look for an internship instead.\n\nI want to treat this like more than just an assignment, because one day I will need to apply for an internship! (I'm taking summer classes this year so I've got some time). I love music, and ideally I'd like to work somewhere involving audio production (Shure, Bose, Yamaha, something like that). Also, companies like Asus, EVGA, etc. would be cool. I can't find many internships or co-ops for those sorts of companies though... so the whole point of this post. Does anyone know companies I could research an internship/co-op for, given my interests?",

Its obvious to me that since all computers are designed with electrical components, having some basic knowledge of circuits is required. So now I'm beginning to wonder if that is the only reason why we have some features that are so important. For example, we all know that the processor can run faster than memory can, and that in order to compensate for this we need the cache. But lets just imagine a scenario where memory was made with different technology, and could run at the same speed. If this were so, couldn't we just totally ditch the cache? Besides, its not like technologies don't get ditched all the time, especially in computer technology. ",

        "text": "I've been learning a lot about operating systems and specifically Linux, but am a bit overwhelmed and could use a bit of guidance to best decide what direction to go in with my readings. \n\nThe first thing I am not fully understanding is how a kernel can be applied to a wide array of processors, even ones that use the same architecture. One example, I know that operating systems rely heavily on internal timer interrupts for scheduling processes. Despite using the same instruction set, different ARM processors handle and configure timers differently, right? How can Linux for a specific instruction set be compatible with all these processors? My best guess to this question is that it is not compatible from the get-go, and that the kernel needs to be modified to even operate on a specific processor, but this doesn't seem like the case given that people are able to install linux on a variety of PCs with different chips without modification. \n\nThis somewhat ties in to my next question: What is the general process required to prepare the base linux kernel for a certain processor? For example, if I bought a development board with an ARM microprocessor on it (e.g. beagle board black), what steps would need to be taken in modifying a base ARM Linux kernel to run on it? I know they have already made and provide their own Linux image for the board, but I am curious as to what they had to do in order to make that custom image for their board. \n\nAny input would be appreciated!",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI have been working on an algorithm to compute the most cost-effective configuration of solar photovoltaic (PV) and lithium-ion energy storage for Sustainable Energy Generation Systems (SEGSs). SEGSs are stand-alone (off-grid) electric power systems that provide electricity to end-users independently from renewable energy. Renewable energy resources and energy storage systems (ESSs) are the main components of SEGSs, and the main challenge is figuring out how much renewable energy and how much energy storage are required to supply power year-round. \n\nBy considering oversized PV, the algorithm approximates the energy storage requirements for increasingly oversized PV. The result is a graph showing [all possible configurations]( https://i.imgur.com/kbjhurC.png) of PV and energy storage; here is an [animation](https://imgur.com/OTyTMvb) of what this looks like.\n\nThe previous graph shows an inverse relationship between PV and energy storage; this property is important to optimize for the cheapest system. Since PV and energy storage have different costs, the algorithm computes the [price of each configuration]( https://i.imgur.com/WPBwQlc.png) and determines the most cost-effective system shown by the red “x”.\n\nThe algorithm I developed requires the expected hourly time-series power supply of the PVs and the expected hourly time-series power demand data of the electric grid for the entire year. The algorithm iterates through this data to compute the time-series stored energy of the ESS. Starting at the first hour the algorithm compares the generation and consumption. If generation exceeds consumption, the extra energy is stored. If consumption exceeds generation, the ESS supplies the missing power. The algorithm continues this process taking into account efficiency, efficiency degradation, and self-discharge. In my model, the initial efficiency is 90%, and the default efficiency degradation rate is 1% per year, so after 5 years, the efficiency decreases to 85%. In addition, the default self-discharge rate is 5% per month which equates to 0.00007% per hour; every hour the algorithm decreases the stored energy by this percentage. \n\nHere is a link to the [algorithm](https://github.com/OffGridEnergy/offgrid-solar-power-system), and here is the [technical document](http://docdro.id/gwUIVP7) I have been working on. Section V describes more information about the algorithm. \n\nI have been researching this topic but it's been challenging so I’m asking for help. How can I improve my model to make it more realistic? I can measure the cylce count and the SOC of the ESS, but I'm not sure how these parameters affect the ESS. Are there other assumptions that I need to make and are there any other storage losses that I need to account for (e.g. SOC self-discharge)?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!\n",

        "text": "Basically to explain I am setting a project to be able to stop a mass from moving at a certain distance that is on a linear air rail ( to remove friction) so I can do tests and collect data for a future space project. What I had in mind was to hook up an arduino to an accelerometer, motion sensor, and a dc fan. I will give the mass an initial push and try to stop the mass by blowing the fan in the opposite direction and would like to use the motion sensor to detect where exactly I am in relation to the point I want it to stop moving at. So if I’m moving too fast close to the stopping point, the fan will blow harder than it would if I was far away moving at the same speed? Is this a feasible setup. I will admit this is for school and I am a undergradmechanical engineer, and I know what the wiki says. I’m not asking anyone to code anything for me , just wondering if this is at all possible because I am new to the arduino world. ATMega2560 is the model if that matters",

        "text": "I'm trying to wrap my head around safety standards for electrical equipment (as can be seen in my last handful of posts... thanks to everyone who has offered their time to help!). My device is medical, so for me section 8 of IEC60601-1 is what really matters to me, but it's kind of my understanding that all of the safety standards (e.g. IEC60950) use approximately the same language and logic, however 60601 has the most stringent thresholds for acceptable safety during testing.\n\nThe general concept behind the entire thing seems to be that your device must remain safe under all single fault conditions. 'Safe' is whenever leakage currents don't exceed the thresholds given in the standard. And besides describing the tests, Section 8 seems to be entirely dedicated to defining exactly what constitutes a 'single fault'. There are a list of external single faults listed in the standard (e.g. open protective earth conductor), but it is also your responsibility to consider every possibly internal fault and ensure that the leakage currents are never exceeded.\n\nThese internal failures can be shorts and opens of any single component on the circuit board, and could be shorts across any single insulation less than 2 means of protection (as defined in the standard by creepage, clearance or solid thickness). Additionally, any and all insulation not adequate to be considered 1 means of protection can be shorted out in addition to the external and internal single fault conditions. This notion of 'two means of protection' is introduced and I believe (and I could be wrong here) that what this is getting at is that IF any given single fault produces a leakage current that exceeds the threshold, then an additional means of protection is necessary. Is that correct idea?\n\nI have a million+1 questions about this, but where I am really stuck here is specifically regarding what you need to do on the secondary side of an isolation transformer to make it single fault safe. For the purposes of this question, let's assume the circuit inside the device is dead simple.\n\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/3ZISq.png\n\n-Powered from AC mains through isolation transformer\n-Secondary is just a 2 resistors\n-Enclosure is protectively earthed.\n-Everything is contained in the enclosure\n-Secondary voltage $V_s$ could be anything, really.\n-One side of secondary winding is connected to the enclosure at a single point.\n\nFor the fault conditions I am showing here, when I trace through where the fault currents should flow, I can't see where the hazard is to person in the leakage current tests(represented by MD). I think the only test that matters for this situation is the earth leakage test, but it seems like it would never fail as long as your primary side passes the test.\n\nIt's too simple, What the heck am I missing? Is it not the leakage test the matters? Is it a touch current test? But isn't everything protectively earthed and you can't do a touch test? I can imagine that a large fault current flowing through the finite impedance enclosure could present a hazard, but oddly, only when the protective earth conductor is intact (bottom left).",

        "text": "First, my schematic:  https://imgur.com/a/PwA10\n\nI need a constant current dummy load for testing a power supply I'll be making next.  I found a couple designs, but this op-amp/mosfet design is pretty popular.  I watch this guy a lot, so I went with his basic design. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xX2SVcItOA&amp;t=32s).  I'm using mostly parts I have laying around.\n\nThe core of the design is a mosfet with feedback to an op-amp (IC3D), which measures the voltage drop across a low-side sense resistor (R1).  I wanted to know how much current is flowing through the load, so I added a high-side current sense resistor (R6) and a MAX4080 current sensing IC.  The MAX4080 doesn't work on the low-side, and I'm not entirely sure how to change the design to eliminate the low-side resistor.  The output from the MAX4080 is fed through a filter and a divider to the ADC of the MCU.  I also wanted to know what the input voltage was, so I added a voltage divider and a buffer (VSENS), which is also read by the ADC.  Control of the current through the mosfet is done with a PWM from PWMIADJ, which gets filtered, divided, buffered (IC3C), divided and fed into IC3D.  Now that I'm looking at it, I can probably replace R9 with a 2.5K, and eliminate IC3C, R2 and R5.\nI want to be able to test loads from 1V to 25V or so, up to 1A, so I realized I needed to use a battery to power the MCU and a TTL serial LCD separately if I want to test a load of 3.3V at 50mA, for instance.  For a stable voltage reference, I used a 5.1V zener diode and a 100ohm resistor.  That wasn't actually very stable over changes in input voltage.  With some experimentation, I figured out that an op-amp buffer between the resistor and diode gave me a very stable reference voltage for the MCU ADC.  Is there a better way to do this?\nMy zener setup needs 7.4V minimum to stay stable, and I still need 5V for the MCU and LCD, so I used a LM7805 with a 9V battery to get what I need.  I'm not sure if the zener needs 7.4, or if the LM324 (IC3A) op-amp is limiting me.  The control circuit consumes about 100mA, so I estimate I'll get about an hour of battery life from the 9V, which isn't much.  I've toyed with other ideas, like using the power from the load I'm testing to run the control circuit, but I'd like to be able to test down to 10-20mA.  I've also thought of making this use a wall-wart for power, but I want it to be mobile and easy.  \nI can use a 2.5V zener instead, and lose some resolution on my ADC, but be able to power the circuit with 6.25V (the lowest the LM7805 will go) and possibly use another type of battery.  Now that I think of it, the MAX4080 needs 4.5V, so I'll need to power it with the LM7805 also.\n\nAny other critiques?\n\nEdit:  Thanks guys,  you've been a ton of help.  I'm learning a lot from the feedback! \n",

        "text": "For a university project class, we are making a brushed DC motor from scratch. This means we'll have to buy components such as magnet wire, magnets, 3D print and waterjet cut rotors, casings, and components, etc.\n\nThe main purpose of the motor is to be able to rotate with precision and speed, between 0 and 180 degrees (which will be controlled via a controller implementing PID). \n\nTherefore, the motor will have to be very quick in terms of turning to specific positions. The torque will be constant (the motor will need very little torque since there is virtually no load attached).\n\nWhen designing and making the motor, are there any things I should look out for/ keep in mind? For example, the standard strengths of magnets, the AWG of the insulated copper wire, a recommended number of poles to implement in the rotor, and how to optimize the commutator and brush contacts.\n\nI'm not asking for direct answers, but looking for some advice since someone might have more experience in how those parameters practically contribute to motor performance. Any input and ideas/ experiences regarding motor design are greatly appreciated!!!",
