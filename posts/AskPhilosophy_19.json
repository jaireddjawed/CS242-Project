        "text": "I consider myself 'decently' read on free will for a layperson. I'm a neuroscientist by training, and my forays into free will have largely been in the form of Books rather than academic literature. To put another way, I've read a lot from the bookstore, but not really much from my institutional access  - A couple of high impact papers from big names, but little from the understory. There's definitely a lot out there i've not been exposed to. \n\nI would broadly consider myself a compatibilist along Dennett's lines and I don't see much friction between this and my day job, although most of my colleagues do. Harris is well-regarded in my circles I suppose because he 'plays for the team', but I'm very sympathetic to the claim that Harris doesn't deserve much of a response from philopshy, because he hasn't bothered to engage with philopshy in the first place. Despite adoring most of the book, I felt much the same way of Sapolsky's chapter on 'Free Will' in Behave. I can't comment on his upcoming book, but I expect the same (Probably going to read it anyway, though). The point is, I think these popular attempts to discuss free will in the context of neuroscience have been very wanting. \n\nHaving tried to read 'both sides' honestly, my first conclusion is that there is a lot of justified exasperation among philosophers at neuroscientists seeming unwillingness to engage genuinely. I hope I'm at least perceived as trying to be genuine but I have no doubt I'd elicit a lot of exasperation too. Harris and Sapolsky both strike me as coming into the question with a particular background and refusing to engage with other work before claiming their view. I understand this exacerbation well, because I expect it's similar to how I feel when popular physicists try talk about neuroscience and clearly don't understand the first thing about it. So there seems to be some bad blood and lots of 'talking past each-other.'\n\nAt the same time, neuroscience rarely features significantly in discussions of free will in philopshy. Maybe this is unfair of me to expect - philopshers are not neuroscientists, after all. Even though I don't think Harris or Sapolsky take a well-informed interpretation of the neuroscience results Vis-à-vis Free Will, I would still consider the raw biology itself an important piece of understanding free will.  If free will does exist, then I think in principle it should exist 'via'  neuroscience/biological mechanisms (Or maybe this is an error in itself?). \n\nSo I'm wondering if there are any authors (from either side of the isle) that attempt to engage with the same 'Set of Facts' from biology that Harris and Sapolsky draw on, but discuss and contextualize these facts within the vast amount of work done in philopshy and without seeming to degenerate the field. The closest to this I've read is Peter Tse's Criterial Causation theory -- which I love for it's uniqueness and genuine attempt to get past a \"Neurons fire and behavior happens. There's no room for any kind of free will\" interpretation of biology, but ultimately find fairly lacking as an actual compelling theory. \n\nI hope this question makes sense, I have to admit as much as I enjoy reading about free will, I think it's a topic that scratches the edges of my intellectual abilities - even with popular books like Elbow Room. The motivation for me asking is that twofold: both, it seems to me any ultimate theory of free will must touch on neuroscience (maybe you disagree?), but I also think 'conching' the phil, which I'm trying to grapple with, in things I'm already familiar with will be a good avenue for me to develop a better personal understanding.",

        "text": "Oh, what a fascinating topic we have here! Let's dive into the deep and meaningful world of philosophy, shall we? After all, who doesn't love contemplating the complex and abstract nature of existence while basking in the warm glow of a good old-fashioned sun clock?\n\nIt's no secret that philosophy has been around for centuries, serving as a beacon of wisdom and insight for all of humankind. And what better way to pay homage to this timeless tradition than by using it as nothing more than a fancy, outdated sundial? I mean, really, what's the point of all those ponderings about morality, ethics, and the meaning of life when you can simply tell time by the position of the sun?\n\nIt's truly a testament to the modern era that we can so easily dismiss such a rich and invaluable legacy as nothing more than a joke. I mean, what do we really gain from contemplating the works of Aristotle, Plato, and other great thinkers? It's not like their ideas have had any significant impact on our understanding of the world or influenced the way we live our lives. No, no, no. Let's just laugh at their primitive sun clock and move on.\n\nAnd let's not forget the modern-day philosophers, who continue to delve into the depths of the human experience with their complex theories and abstract musings. How quaint. How cute. How utterly useless in a world that values practicality and efficiency above all else.\n\nIt's not like philosophy has played a role in shaping the political and social structures of our society or influenced our perceptions of reality. No, no, no. Philosophy is nothing but a silly sun clock, a relic of a bygone era that we can only shake our heads at and chuckle at its quaintness.\n\nSo, let's not waste our time with all this philosophical nonsense. Let's focus on what's truly important: telling time by the sun. Because why bother with the complexities of the human experience when you can simply know what time it is with a quick glance at the sky?\n\nIn conclusion, let's not be fooled by the allure of philosophy. It's nothing but an ancient sun clock, a joke that modern society has taken nothing from. So let's just laugh and move on, shall we?",

        "text": "I was having a discussion with my parents about a common occurrence that is currently happening in the medical community of a family friend’s home country. This home country is considered a developing country located in Asia and while isn’t the most impoverished is still considered one of the poorer countries in the world.\n\nBasically, it’s been becoming more common for physicians, nurses, and all healthcare professionals in this country to take advantage of their patient’s health and ignorance. For example, a family member is dying from illness, and while these doctors should ideally be treating them like the doctors in more developed countries would they instead leech off of their family’s already low income and pretend that there’s still hope for their sick family member to get better, when actually they’re only keeping their heart monitor on and they’ve been barely alive for weeks. The doctor and their team will keep pretending until the family member actually dies and by then the poor family would have sold all of their belongings including their home, leaving them not only homeless but also having to deal with pain of losing loved one. \n\nI argued that those healthcare \"professionals\" who practice this are unethical and bad people. My parents however argued that because it’s a poor country, they have no choice but to do this to make a living and feed their family. Their colleagues are already all doing this, so why wouldn’t they? The immorality behind the practice itself can be rationed by the fact that they live in an impoverished country and they have a family to feed. If they decide not to go along with this practice they will somehow be removed from their position and be forced to find a much lower paying job despite having a medical-level education. \n\nI relentlessly disagreed that no good human being, in any dire circumstances such as in poverty, harm, or pain would ever resort to practising this type of evil action. Those who do, and those who decide to because their colleagues are doing so are not morally upright nor good in nature. Those who go against this practice for moral and ethical reasons despite the risk of having their family starve are good in nature, and can find any alternative way to feed their family while remaining virtuous.\n\nJust like the classic \"would you steal bread to feed your family\" scenario, do you agree that in dire circumstances such as with these medical experts, they are ethically and morally entitled to stealing from their patients in this way in order to feed their family?

In this respect they are analogous to movies, which (as displayed) consist of rapid sequences of still images.\n\nRetentional Model: our experiencing of change and succession occurs within episodes of consciousness which themselves lack temporal extension, but whose contents present (or represent) temporally extended intervals and phenomena. These episodes thus have a complex structure, comprising momentary phases of immediate experience, along with representations (or retentions) of the recent past. Our streams of consciousness are composed of successions of these momentary states.\n\nExtensional Model: our episodes of experiencing are themselves temporally extended, and are thus able to incorporate change and persistence in a quite straightforward way.

        "text": "In the famous E2p40s, where Spinoza provides a taxonomy of the three kinds of knowledge, he says that the intellect can form ideas of the essences of things:  \"I will hereafter show, a third kind of knowledge, which we will call intuition. This kind of knowledge proceeds from an adequate idea of the absolute essence of certain attributes of God **to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things**.\"\n\nWhat does he mean precisely by the essence of a thing? Coming from panpsychism literature, I conceive of the essence of a thing as that which the thing is \"in itself\", how it is \"like to be\" that thing. From the [SEP page](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#RussMoni), in the subsection about Russellian monism: \"The information we get from the physical sciences is in some significant sense limited. There are subtle variations on how exactly this is put, but the idea is that the physical sciences only tell us about the *extrinsic*, *relational*, *mathematical*, or *dispositional* nature of matter, and **leave us in the dark about its** ***intrinsic*****,** ***concrete*** **and** ***categorical*** **nature. Physics tells us how an electron behaves, but it doesn’t tell us how it is in and of itself**.\"\n\nMy question is twofold:\n\n1. What exactly does Spinoza mean by essence? \n2. How is it possible, for Spinoza, that the intellect can perceive the \"inner nature\" of things external to it? Wouldn't the intellect necessarily only represent the extrinsic qualities of things? \n\nThank you very much :)",

We are conscious, rational thinkers because we were able to gather the information required to be so. If we had no senses at all, would we be able to think? Would we be able to know? Thinking involves language, and past experiences. If we experienced nothing, presumably we would not be capable of thought. Without thought, are we conscious? I hypothesize that the \"I,\" or consciousness, came about when we gathered a certain amount of information as young children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that what we consider to be \"I,\" is a collection of information.

The non-naturalist claims that making a correct moral judgement can be the upshot of something like sense-perception: we can sometimes perceive that a particular action is bad and move from that perception to a judge- ment to that effect. Likewise, we can sometimes perceive that a par- ticular action has certain natural features and thereby perceive that that action has a certain non- natural moral property. For example, (a) I perceive that Jones is inflicting pointless deliberate cruelty on the cat, and thereby perceive that what Jones is doing to the cat is wrong; likewise, (b) I perceive that Smith is inflicting pointless deliberate cruelty on the child, and thereby perceive that what Smith is doing to the child is wrong. Now, given that the supervenience of the moral on the natural is a priori, the following is a priori also:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;(1) Any two actions which are acts of inflicting pointless deliberate cruelty (and otherwise identical in their naturalistic properties) must receive the same moral evaluation.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;But there seems to be no way that we could get to the a priori (1) from (a), (b) and the like: no matter how many more instances of pointless deliberate cruelty we perceive, the inductive generaliza- tion to (1) will yield at best an a posteriori truth. So non-naturalism in effect renders mysterious the a priori supervenience of the moral on the natural. Given that 'recognition of the way in which the moral supervenes on the natural is a constraint on the proper use of moral concepts' (Smith 1994a: 22), non-naturalism is thereby thrown into doubt. \n\nI'm a bit confused about the argument: Isn't he saying from (a), (b) and the a priori truth of the supervenience of the moral on to the natural, we get to (1)? But right after he says (1), at best, is an a posteriori truth, Miller says that the entire idea of moral supervenience is put into question. Why did he show this argument instead of just denying the premise of the a priori truth?",

        "text": "In my opinion, I do not believe that, after you die, your experience shifts entirely into an eternal dreamless sleep. If matter can combine in a way to form an arbitrary consciousness that will be able to experience things first-hand, then chances are it will happen again one this one is destroyed and a new one forms later on. The fact that it happened at all gives me the belief that it could very well happen again.\n\nAs terrifying as the idea of no experience after death sounds, at the very least it sounds \"stable\". As in, the experience would indefinitely be in an ongoing state of rest and safety. Nothing to hurt it or anything, it will essentially be protected.\n\nRight now, life on Earth isn't the easiest thing in the world (there's a pun here somewhere). Lots of \"experiences\" have to deal with misery, suffering, anxiousness, depression, loss, trauma, and so on, without even asking for it. It just happened to them. For all we know, that's just the tip of the iceberg, and it could get a whole lot worse. So much worse that humans can't even fathom. At least by being in a forever \"state\" of death, that possibility of going through that is eliminated.\n\nAs far as human knowledge and understanding has come, there's still a whole lot we don't know, and there's definitely signs of a force greater than us. A universe so vast that our technology is probably unable to even reach or identify all of it. Dark matter, not much is known about what that is yet. We're a species that observes patterns and extrapolates to form hypotheses. But I still believe humans have barely scratched the surface. That unknown is terrifying.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10qps1p/do_negative_emotions_serve_any_significant/",
        "text": "I'm a student going to start university this year and I recently came across an essay on Aeon titled 'The helpful delusion', which I found a very interesting perspective on the function our emotions serve. The timing also happened to coincide with one of my introductory psychology classes where I learned about 'learned helplessness' and how it's a signal from your brain to stop doing something that you keep on doing despite repeated failures.\n\nBoth the essay and the concept of learned helplessness gave rise to some questions that I thought someone here would be able to resolve for me or at least guide me towards the right path. The first question is- Could it be possible that negative emotions like anxiety and jealousy don't actually indicate that there exists some problem in our daily lives, but that they are the problems themselves; put another way, could it be that it's just because of these emotions that we are compelled to change our way of doing things, and we that we would've done just fine without them?\n\nI understand that some of our instinctive visceral reactions and intuitions evolved to help us survive in an environment where the cost of not listening to your emotions was quite high, but in the modern world, I notice that the intensity of such negative emotions is too high and so they cause too much suffering which makes me doubt whether the benefits of these emotions really outweigh all the suffering that they cause. Would a person who doesn't go through such emotions over a long period of time really be at a risk proportionate to the suffering they need to deal with, when it's not even clear what the emotions are saying and whether they are really beneficial or just dysfunctional?\n\nWhat's the line separating dysfunction and a healthy amount of emotions? When do we know that an emotion is pushing us towards changing our life situation, or just an unnecessary malfunctioning of our biology that needs to be cured? For instance, in learned helplessness, when do we know we should really stop trying to achieve our goals, or we should push ourselves despite repeated failures because circumstances change and oftentimes emotions lead to irrational decisions?\n\nOne last point I'd like to mention involves psychopaths and their ability to not feel any emotion. I usually wonder if overall their satisfaction with life is higher, because even though their lack of inhibitions leads to excessive risk-taking behaviour, they don't go through prolonged periods of suffering, and the only cost is an increased risk of death. Some would argue that death is better than suffering, and I also think we could learn something about the mechanisms of emotions from them.\n\nI'm still a beginner to this subject, but I am curious about knowing the answers to these questions. I apologize in advance if my questions reflect a poor grasp of the topic or that I seem to have misunderstood any concept you attempted to explain. In that case, I'd be willing to learn and greatly appreciate it if you could help me clear my doubts. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.",

Oddly enough, he seems to condemn homosexuality in “The Laws” when he states that Homosexuality should be treated the same way as incest. This would seem a fairly normal view for the more socially conservative Ancient Greek world, yet it seems strange when you ponder that in his “Race to heaven” thought experiment in which he portrays same sex lovers as not just equal to heterosexual lovers; but having a head start in the race to heaven due to “their deeper care for one another (his words, not mine)”. This is made even stranger when you consider that one of the reasons Socrates; the mentor whom he so highly regarded, respected, and mourned; was (in part as this was not a formal charge) killed for his alleged romance with his ex-student (turned treasonous general) Alcibiades. He says that Homosexuality is Amoral, despite appearing to take issue with moralism in his earlier dialogues. Suppose the philosophical question in this is what made Plato turn to radical moralism, despite the fact that radical moralism technically killed his closest confident? I can’t find anything in his works or online, so any help is highly appreciated.",

        "text": "By ‘reductionist’, I am referring to the position that all sciences are reducible to physics, or even that all entities are reducible to entities describable in the language of physics.\n\nSo, given that throughout the history of philosophy, concepts like duality of the mind/ soul and body were generally accepted, whereas modern neuroscience seems to focus on scientific causal explanations of how the mind operates or specifically ideas like consciousness, I am quite confused on current standings in academia. In turn, my question is: are most ‘phil of mind’-ers in academia in favour of reductionist stances like JJC Smart’s view that mental phenomena = physical phenomena? Or is there a more nuanced consensus, I am quite interested in real academics (i.e. not simply operating through religious beliefs) in favour of, say, the existence of a soul, or that mental phenomena are not just explained by physics.",

Most materialist writers who I've read (Marx, Nietzsche) already begin with the position of materialism, and have very little actual argument against idealism (besides calling it ridiculous). \n\nTyia.",

That would mean that the only thing of which we know that affect the faculty of sensibility of our soul is the multiplicity of sensation which is unorganised and meaningless which would have to affect us in some way for the giving birth or something else. What does death mean in the Kantian system then, if it would have to include a change in the mind which is seperate from the multiplicity of sense experience, forms it into a coherent whole, yet is fundementally changed by it.
