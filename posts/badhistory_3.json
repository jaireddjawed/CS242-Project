        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! It has certainly been a while since my last review. As I finished my contract position last week, I have had lots of spare time. There has been some call-backs from employment agencies, but nothing solid has emerged yet. This makes it an excellent occasion for another submission. I am continuing my series of reviews about the movie Dragon Blade:\n\nPart One: [https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5phnzt/a\\_byzantinebasileus\\_movie\\_review\\_dragon\\_blade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5phnzt/a_byzantinebasileus_movie_review_dragon_blade/)\n\nPart Two: [https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5qau24/a\\_byzantinebasileus\\_movie\\_review\\_dragon\\_blade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5qau24/a_byzantinebasileus_movie_review_dragon_blade/)\n\nMy drink of choice is Woodford Reserve - Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey. So let us begin!\n\n46.08: Jackie Chan’s family has been captured and is about to be executed for treason. Luckily, he arrives and acquires two swords that look like this:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cpUPWy9](https://imgur.com/a/cpUPWy9)\n\nA Han Dynasty blade could indeed be straight and single edged:,\n\n[http://chineseswords2.freewebspace.com/photo6.html](http://chineseswords2.freewebspace.com/photo6.html)\n\nBut the cross-guard and fittings border are very unrealistic. DRINK!\n\n46.11: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!\n\n46.30: “He has four swords! We are outnumbered!”\n\n47.42: The Chinese soldiers:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ECHRkpm](https://imgur.com/a/ECHRkpm)\n\nLook more like those from the Ming Dynasty around 1500 years later:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/8L0o4Bg](https://imgur.com/a/8L0o4Bg)\n\nDRINK!\n\n47:03: “Guys, why do we always leave our shields back in the barracks?”\n\n49.29: Like any good Dungeons and Dragons player Jackie Chan brought along the rest of the party when trying to rescue an NPC.\n\n50.10: It’s an indication of good writing when a female character exists only so she can get stuffed into a fridge:\n\n[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge)\n\nThis is also known as the Joss Whedon School of Character Development.\n\n50.36: This is what happens when you send a bunch of Swashbucklers against Rangers who focus on archery.\n\n52.28: You can tell he is a bad guy because he is wearing eye-liner.\n\n54.11: \"Like sands through the hour-glass……\"\n\n54.30: The armor worn by Adrian Brody is absolutely ridiculous. Here is what it looks like:\n\n[https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-adrien-brody-dragon-blade-tian-jiang-xiong-shi-2015-136842631.html](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-adrien-brody-dragon-blade-tian-jiang-xiong-shi-2015-136842631.html)\n\nIt was certainly common for wealthy individuals to decorate and embellish their armor as a sign of rank, especially in the Roman army:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/qakbHSu](https://imgur.com/a/qakbHSu)\n\nHowever, the armor depicted here looks like a sheet of iron placed over plastic, with clear vulnerable areas around the lower torso and neck-line, locations that armor was often specifically designed to protect. DRINK!\n\n55.10: I am pretty sure Adrian Brody is about to say “Just as planned”.\n\n55.47: It turns out the scheme was to let John Cusak flee with his troops to Central Asia so Adrian Brody could invade and annex the region. There are some slight…… difficulties with this plan. First of all, here is a very general map of the Roman Republic towards the end of the 1st century BC:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/O35iLmV](https://imgur.com/a/O35iLmV)\n\nHere is a map of Parthia from around the same period:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Kb32CnW](https://imgur.com/a/Kb32CnW)\n\nIn order to reach Central Asia, the Romans would have had to have marched through the Parthian Empire. And of course, when Crassus tried that he was horribly defeated at Carrhae. The Parthian military system based on a large number of horse-archers and a small amount of cataphracts was generally a good counter to that used by the Romans at this time. The Parthians could strategically and tactically out-manoeuvre the legions and engage in battle only when conditions were favorable. Even if the Romans were not intent on conquest, the Parthians would have still constantly harassed them and cut off their supplies. If they could acquire supplies in the first place. So such a large force getting to the region would have been impossible. DRINK!\n\n56.25: This entire scene contains more ham than a pork factory.\n\n57.55: This dagger was brought to you by the Smiths of Erebor. Why buy right when you can buy Dwarf-Wright!\n\n59.39: At some point during filming the producers decided to outsource the hiring of extras to New Zealand:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/SXgOK8I](https://imgur.com/a/SXgOK8I)\n\n1.00.14: What shall the peoples of China do in the face of this W̶e̶s̶t̶e̶r̶n̶  Roman aggression?\n\n1.02.44: FANTASY ROMAN SPEARS! DRINK!\n\n1.05:01: I will actually praise the film for having the armies line up in organized ranks:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/yhaQRGc](https://imgur.com/a/yhaQRGc)\n\n1.05.38: FANTASY ROMAN SWORD! DRINK!\n\n1.07.09: The Roman formation here is completely inaccurate. The first line is equipped with spears and shields but no javelin. The next few ranks have crossbows (which the Romans did not use in this time period), followed by the rear ranks holding spears but no shields. A Roman Army of the 1st century BC would have had the legionnaires uniformly equipped with shields, javelins and swords, whilst long-distance missile weapons would have been used by auxiliaries. DRINK!\n\nAnd that it is for now.

Now while I can smell BS when someone makes vague broad stroke claims like consistently taking 50% less casualties than they caused. Simply by looking at the fact the Nazis lost like over 5 million men on the Western front. Which is close to the number the allies deployed.\n\nAnyway I was hoping a big strong historian could lay me ou-. I mean lay out the factually wrong stuff with this article.\n\nEdit: Here's some choice pieces from this article.\n\nYet amid all this, in northwest Europe the Allied leaders invited their ground troops to fight the Wehrmacht with equipment inferior in every category save artillery and transport. German machine-guns, mortars, machine-pistols, antitank weapons and armored personnel carriers were all superior to those of Britain and America. Above all, Germany possessed better tanks. The Sherman, which dominated the Allied campaign, was a superbly reliable piece of machinery. But it was fatally flawed by lack of an adequate gun to penetrate the Tiger and Panther; and by poor battlefield survivability in the face of German tank guns.\n\n\"On a man for man basis, German ground soldiers consistently inflicted casualties at about a 50 percent higher rate than they incurred from the opposing British and American troops under all circumstances (emphasis in original). This was true when they were attacking and when they were defending, when they had a local numerical superiority and when, as was usually the case, they were outnumbered, when they had air superiority and when they did not, when they won and when they lost.\"\n\nThe notorious American infantry replacement system, by which men were arbitrarily posted to a numbered, non-territorial unit, and had no chance to build the loyalty possible in a British regiment, created deep unhappiness among many men, and contributed to the U.S. Army's alarming total of almost a million battle-fatigue cases in World War II.\n\nIt was probably fortunate for the future of Western civilization, but greatly increased Eisenhower's difficulties, that few Allied soldier saw themselves for a moment as other than civilians temporarily in uniform, while their German counterparts possessed an uncanny ability to transform themselves from butchers and bank clerks into natural tacticians. One of the more absurd propaganda cliches of the war was the image of the Nazi soldier as an inflexible squarehead. In reality, the German soldier almost invariably showed far greater flexibility on the battlefield than his Allied counterpart.\n\nIf so, this was an error of judgment that continues to cost America dear today. The shortcomings of American infantry in World War II were repeated in Korea, and in Vietnam. It is a great delusion to suppose that the Indochina war revealed unique, unprecedented problems in the U.S. Army. The American army created in World War II had suffered weaknesses and difficulties. These weaknesses, highlighted by media attention and by defeat, had existed since World War II but had never been discussed before.",

I broke it down piece by piece to look at exactly why it was wrong.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say that this video was interesting but also raised some questions on its validity on the history stated and the information provided. It's important to note that nearly every single documentary or book on history always cites its sources on anything, no matter how good. The best books and documentaries not only cite them but give the context as to why the information was used and the reason for its historical significance. I noticed that this video not only did not do that, but it does not even have a reference to the person or group who made it. That being said, the Facebook page and group that shared it has been observed and noted by fact checkers from Media Bias/Fact Check (an a-political website used to sort through sources on the internet to find invalidity- either left or right). Molon Labe Industries has this on their case file: r/[https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/molon-labe-media/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/molon-labe-media/). That being said, anyone who watches this should take the information with a grain of salt.\n\nAfter saying that, I'll list a few reasons why the points that the video made are wrong at certain points and I will list some credible sources about the history and definitions that this video claims to educate about. The video states that most Americans believe that we live in a democracy when that is simply not true. Any political science class and history class will immediately go over different forms of government and what their definition and methods are before placing them on the political spectrum. When the video states that we live in a Republic and not a democracy, this immediately raises a red flag. The dictionary definition of democracy is \"government by the people; especially : rule of the majority (r/[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy)).\" There are two main forms of democracy which operate in distinctive ways. The video does accurately describe one: the direct democracy, where individuals are able to directly influence policy by voting at the matters at hand. In Ancient Greece, the first form of this democracy came into existence in the Fourth and Fifth Century BCE in the City State of Athens (r/[https://www.ancient.eu/Athenian\\_Democracy/](https://www.ancient.eu/Athenian_Democracy/)). Any male over the age of 18 was able to vote directly on matters. Any male over the age of 30 was able to serve as a juror. At times of war, five hundred randomly selected citizens were drafted into a War Council that was able to more directly vote on issues to speed up democracy . The limitations of this government were met when they were not able to act quickly and stop foreign invasions and armies due to the bulkiness of direct democracy (r/[https://www.ancient.eu/Athenian\\_Democracy/](https://www.ancient.eu/Athenian_Democracy/)). The second form of democracy, the one that the video does not mention, is a Representative Democracy. This came into existence in Ancient Rome in 509 BCE. This form of government was distinctive to the Grecian form of Direct Democracy. In Rome, “there were two different popular assemblies, the centuriate assembly and the tribal assembly. The centuriate assembly was military in nature; it voted on war and peace and elected all those magistrates who exercised imperium (military power). The tribal assembly was a non-military civilian assembly that elected those magistrates who did not exercise imperium. It did most of the legislating and sat as a court for serious public offenses (r/[https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Republic).”](https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Republic).%E2%80%9D) They also were able to appoint a dictator to step in for six months in times of crisis to be able to directly influence policy. This decision not only worked, but worked well. Not a single Roman Dictator held power for longer than the time appointed by the council ([https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Republic](https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Republic).)\n\nThis segways into my next point: The United States is a democracy, as it is a Representative Democracy. The Founding Fathers took heavy inspiration from the Roman Republic. The Law of Twelve Tables in Rome was codified law written by legislators that could not be easily amended without the support of the council. It was visible to all and the supreme law in Rome. This is not unlike the United States Constitution. The Roman Government had two branches of government: the legislative and the judicial branch. Both had equal power to each other under the law. The United States was the first representative democracy to put a third branch into the mix: the presidency. Under the US Constitution, each branch of the government is filled with checks and balances to make them all equal under the law ([https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Republic](https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Republic)).\n\nOn the issues with the political spectrum, there are two main scales that have to be looked at. First is first is the left to right scale, defining how liberal or conservative specific policies are in their nature. Conservative values are typically defined as less for sudden change and more for a gradual integration and the individual whereas liberal values are more so for a more rapid change and the group over the individual (neither of which are necessarily bad, and that’s where the debate lays). The second scale is the Authoritarian to Anarchist scale. The more leaning towards Authoritarian, the more power the government has. The more towards the Anarchist scale, the less power to the government. To define Nazi Germany and Fascism on the political left is false; Nazi Germany (with some left influences) and with it Fascism are Right Authoritarian forms of government. Communist governments are Authoritarian Left forms of government ([https://www.politicalcompass.org/faq#faq1](https://www.politicalcompass.org/faq#faq1)).\n\nThe video also suggests that the Founding Fathers were inherently against democracies due to the failures of the Grecian Direct Democracy. However, this can also be found false. James Wilson was one of the main drafters of the Constitution and one of the first Supreme Court Justices. He said there were three forms of government, “monarchical, aristocratical, and democratical,” and that in a democracy the sovereign power is “inherent in the people, and is either exercised by themselves or by their representatives (The Substance of Speech by James Wilson).” Thomas Jefferson wrote in his memoirs in 1815 on the “excellence of representative democracy compared with the misrule of Kings.” When the video cites James Madison in the Federalist Papers #10, it cleverly states that Madison wrote “democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; . . . incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths.” It did leave out how he was speaking on the matter of small democracies and later states about the successes of the Representative Democracy he so proudly built. The City-Journal has an entire article on Madison ([https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/city-journal/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/city-journal/)), and writes:\n\n“The Constitution, by contrast, provides Americans with a form of government that has “no model on the face of the globe”—an extended republic. Its rationale is Madison’s great contribution to political theory and practice. Unlike a pure democracy, a republic delegates power to “a small number of citizens elected by the rest,” and the selection process aims to produce representatives “whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice, will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations.” Since it’s easy for a handful of representatives to gather from great distances for lawmaking sessions, such a government can embrace a very large territory, which yields a further advantage. “Extend the sphere,” Madison argued, “and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens.” A multiplicity of competing interests—like the multiplicity of sects that kept Virginia from imposing a religious tax early in Madison’s political career—prevents a single interest from predominating. “We behold,” Madison triumphantly concluded, “a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government (r/[https://www.city-journal.org/html/james-madison-and-dilemmas-democracy-13359.html).””](https://www.city-journal.org/html/james-madison-and-dilemmas-democracy-13359.html).%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9D)\n\nMadison was clearly in favor of the Representative Democracy he helped build. As for Alexander Hamilton, he too was a found supporter of the Republic and stated his distrust for democracy as did Washington with political parties in Congress. There is nothing wrong about warning the country of what it may become if left unchecked.\n\nOf course, there is more bad history with this video about the fall of the Roman Republic. In 133 BCE, most of Rome was controlled by wealthy aristocrats who had effectively undermined the pillars of the Republic. They had actually seized land to increase the size of the state while undermining the rights of the common man. Soldiers would return home to find their farms now under the direct control of the country. What the video did not state accurately, though, was what lead to the rise of Caesar. People were angry that they were being abused by the government and despite the best attempts by few, there was no other option but to uprise. There was no one on the bottom level demanding for welfare programs or any liberal policies. There was no conception of these at the time. In fact, they were quite angry that their land was being seized as they had mostly just wanted to be left alone. They did not go from a republic to a democracy to an oligarchy. The Roman Republic fell and was immediately replaced by Caesar, a popular military general with a successful political career who had the backing of the people to guarantee their individual right (r/[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/fallofromanrepublic\\_article\\_01.shtml](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/fallofromanrepublic_article_01.shtml)).\n\nIn conclusion, this video is biased in its representation of basic facts, has a fundamental misunderstanding of the history it tries to present, and does not understand political definitions. It should not be taken with any legitimacy. The video is attempting to influence the viewer to believe that democracy is bad when the viewer lives in a democracy. The video uses history that is either out of context or completely wrong to help influence the viewer. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this long essay, but it is important to challenge dangerous narratives and falsehoods when they arise. If you did read this, I encourage you to read more on the topics presented in the in-text citations as those are reputable sources of information and question the reason as to why this video was made.",

Most of the stuff on there didn't really get my attention much, until I came to the last one on the list, wherein our intrepid author farted out this gem:\n\n&gt;1812: Try hiding in the woods with a red jacket on\n&gt;Uniform issues are centuries old. During the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) British soldiers went to war in a dashing red uniform. Understandably, French snipers were able to pick off soldiers with ease as they crept through the undergrowth. Most shocking of all, the uniforms weren't changed until the late 19th Century.\n\n[My fucking face](https://i.imgur.com/zdwZcKI.png)\n\nThis reads like something written by a brain-dead teenager who's entire knowledge of military tactics and doctrine comes from playing Call of Duty, who may have once heard that during the early 19th Century Britain fought a mean Frenchman (Corsican? lol never heard of it) named Napoleon (who was short and tried to take over Europe to compensate for this).\n\nLet's break this shit down. For starters, the Napoleonic Wars weren't the only time the British Army went to war in red coats. The red coat was first officially adopted during the English Civil Wars of the 1600s by Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army. Given that warfare at the time primary consisted of linear or block formations of pikemen and musketeers engaging each other at close range over open ground, camouflage was unimportant, with the main goal of the soldier's uniform being to simply appear uniform. Prior to the creation of the New Model Army, most soldiers wore whatever uniforms their commander provided them with and tended to appear in a variety of colors. Around this time in history attempts were being made at fielding uniformed armies, however it was still difficult and expensive to procure large quantities of dyed cloth. It is believed the British chose red because that was the cheapest and most plentiful dye available at the time.\n\nRed continued to be used by the British Army through the 1700s and into the 1800s. Until around the 1840s, most soldiers went to war with smoothbore muskets, and linear combat doctrine didn't fully disappear until around the early 1900s with the advent of the machinegun and the modern bolt-action rifle. Contrary to the opinions of ignorant people in internet comments sections, linear warfare didn't exist because the generals were stupid, inbred noblemen obsessed with \"honorable combat\", it existed because in the age of smoothbore muskets and bayonets, the best way to win a battle was with massed volley fire followed by a bayonet charge when the enemy line was sufficiently weakened. \n\nA loose band of men taking potshots has the following problems:\n\n- high probability of missed shots (you have a smoothbore musket)\n\n- low rate of fire (worse if you have a rifled musket)\n\n- vulnerability to a massed volley\n\n- vulnerability to a bayonet charge\n\n- vulnerability to cavalry\n\n- inability to be commanded effectively (because radios don't exist and nobody can see each other after a few shots due to all the powder smoke)\n\nIn short, a disorganized mob trying to play Call of Duty with muzzleloaders is going to get charged off the field in short order by a disciplined force fighting in line, or simply hacked to pieces by cavalry. Such tactics did have their place, in the form of skirmishers, who would advance ahead of the main body of troops and harass enemy formations with potshots. They had their place, but could not carry a battle on their own, contrary to what American Revolutionary militia fetishists would have you believe. Obviously, this means that outside of isolated frontier skirmishing and raiding scenarios, the average soldier is going to be marching and fighting in line, not creeping around in the woods bushwacking people. Thus, there is zero need for camouflage for the average soldier. Hence why until around 1900, most armies went into battle wearing colored jackets, the British being no exception to this (though they are probably the most striking example). The French, for their part, wore white prior to the Revolution, and later blue during the Napoleonic Wars, hardly sneaky colors.\n\nWhich brings me to these so-called \"\"\"\"French snipers\"\"\"\". Such a thing did not exist during the Napoleonic Wars. Britain, Austria, certain German states, and sometimes Russia (they couldnt make up their minds) all fielded units of rifle-armed light infantry to act as skirmishers and sharpshooters, but France never bothered with it, Napoleon being unimpressed with rifles due to their expense and slow rate of fire. France did field large amounts of light infantry, but all were armed with the same 1777 Charleville muskets as their brethren in the line regiments. It is possible that the author of this shitty article is referring to one of those simply acting as a sharpshooter, but a smoothbore musket is only really able to reliably hit a man-sized target at about 75 yards or so, hardly \"sniping\", and at that distance you're going to see your target anyway, red coat or not.\n\n0/10 article, the punishment shall be 200 lashes well laid on for disrespecting the King's Army.\n\nSources: mostly just wikipedia to make sure my facts were straight. I've studied the Napoleonic era and early modern warfare for years now.\n\n",

        "author": "pp86",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/90pz5c/apparently_growingup_in_yugoslavia_in_70s_and_80s/",
        "text": "I think we all know which [post](https://i.redd.it/a1qxetjtk9b11.png) I'm referring to, the probably already infamous double-gilded currently sitting at 16k upvotes anti-communist propaganda that would make McCarthy blush. Okay but seriously, it's historically and factually completely wrong.\n\nFirst off Yugoslavia was never part of eastern block, or was in anyway a satellite of USSR, even more after 1948, [Tito split with Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito%E2%80%93Stalin_Split), and started his own \"branch\" of Socialism. Obviously we can't deny, that during the first few years of the split, Tito didn't use \"Stalinist\" methods to get rid of Stalinist, and other political dissenters. It was exactly during this \"purge\", that [Milovan Djilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milovan_Djilas) was ousted from party, for his own views on socialism. And while the \"secret police\" known as [UDBA ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Security_Administration) existed up to dissolution of Yugoslavia in 91', it's power waned after 86', when as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Security_Administration#Post%E2%80%931986_period) say: Intelligence security agencies came under attack, and many people started publicly writing about and criticizing the SDB.\n\nAnd this \"democratisation\" didn't only happen regarding the state police. In [1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Yugoslav_Constitution) a new constitution was passed, which completely changed the way how Yugoslavia was governed. Given that Melania was 4 when the new constitution passed it's safe to say that it was the only thing she knew. Under this constitution the communist party didn't technically exist anymore, at least in the form of party, instead it was reformed as a [League of Communist of Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Communists_of_Yugoslavia), it's role was as a ideological-leader to direct the workers of Yugoslavia down the path of what is in the west known as \"[Titoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titoism)\", but was here known as Self-Managing Socialism, with its end-goal being complete withering away of the state and of party itself.\n\nThat obviously didn't happen, but it did open up Yugoslavia towards more democratic experimentation within confines of socialism. This produced very \"liberal\", or in a way the most strict interpretation of the new constitution, especially within League of Communist Youth of Slovenia (ZSMS), where many progressive movements first formed. And here it's where wikipedia fails me, as there are no English language articles on these topics, so you'll have to trust my knowledge of it. Anyway as said, ZSMS was in late 70's and 80's becoming a hotbed of various progressive movements, which made some pretty big and important steps towards democratisation. So for instance, Slovenia had the first LGBTQ+ movement among socialist countries, ZSMS also helped with first few (AFAIK also first in any socialist country) Punk concerts. But the most important thing was probably the 87' (so after Tito's death) [Relay of the Youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_of_Youth), which was organised on Tito's birthday as a way to celebrate it, and for youth from entire Yugoslavia to come together. In 87' the organisation fell on ZSMS, and they employed then nascent art group known as [NSK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Slowenische_Kunst), whose actual ideology is hard to pinpoint, but it could be described as anarchist, and anti-totalitarian. So when they got the chance to make a poster for the relay, they decided to also criticise the current affairs of Yugoslavia. So the finished [poster](https://www.mladina.si/media/www/slike.old/clanki/200720/foto_plakat_display.jpg) was full of very subtle Nazi-kitch references, which flew over the heads of most bureaucrats within the party, who only later noticed the symbolism. This protest in form of poster ended Relay of Youth events. I'm not sure if this is the right place to talk about what the poster actually meant or was saying. But long story short, the main idea was to signify Yugoslav leadership as fascist and as straying from the path that Tito and Kardelj (both already dead in 87') set forth within 74' constitution.\n\nSo in what kind of society did Melania actually grew up? A society, where pretty much calling leaders of communist party fascist meant they retired the last remnant of Tito's cult of personality. A society where gay were freely gathering. Society where one of the most read weekly [magazines ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mladina) openly criticised policies of government. Again I will not hide the fact that there were attempts of censoring it, and that their [whistle-blower article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBTZ_trial) on state of Yugoslav Army resulted in 4 people being brought and tried before military court, which in the end lead to dissolution of Yugoslavia, but hey whistle-blowers are persecuted even in the US, the main difference being that back then private persons, who weren't in the military were also tried in front of military court. On other hand the regular people could travel almost anywhere they wanted and could buy and \"import\" various western \"luxury\" products without hassle.\n\nBasically she grew up in a pretty normal society not too dissimilar to one we're currently live in, and far from starvation, paranoia and entire living being \"Kafkaesque\".\n\nEDIT: Fixed few mistypes, and added a link to the the last Relay of Youth poster.\n\nEDIT 2: I was accused of not researching anything, and of just spamming wiki-links to support my claims. If anyone is interested (and knows Slovene), there are few interesting books on this topic. Two that deal with the most stuff I included in this post are both by Milan Balažic and are titled: Slovenski Berlinski Zid and Slovenska Demokratična Revolucija 1986 - 1988. Admittedly those two sources are more left-leaning, as they both detail how ZSMS was the real motor behind Slovenian independence, but there are others (I'll try to find few that are at least on par in quality to the two mentioned edit: in my response to my accuser I've mentioned Rosvita Pesek's Osamosvojitev Slovenije, and while this is mostly about 89' and onward it does paint the picture of late 80's Yugoslavia and also stresses the importance of Nova Revija in the push towards independence) who claim that the real push for independence came from the circle around Nova Revija and most influential dissident of the time Jože Pučnik. The truth, I'd say is somewhere in between, both ZSMS and Nova Revija played the part in our democratisation, and more importantly to this post, they both thrived because of the lax \"laws\" of Yugoslavia that really didn't care that much about dissidents in mind 80's. Also both wings did coalesces in times, as for example NSK published their manifesto in Nova Revija, while also made the aforementioned poster for the last Relay of Youth organised by ZSMS.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/90hl6o/the_continued_bad_history_of_neil_degrasse_tyson/",
        "text": "Neil deGrasse Tyson often tells a cautionary tale how belief in God can stymie progress on a front. Supposedly Newton was content with the notion that God kept the solar system stable so he didn’t bother to develop n-body models.\n\nFrom [Tyson’s  keynote address for the TAM6 conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vfOpZD4Sm8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3578):\n\n&gt;Mars comes around and tugs us. Every time Jupiter comes around it tugs on Mars which tugs on us. And you have this system that gets impossibly complex for Newton at the time. He knew enough to say that if you continued the system it would go unstable and fly apart. But it hasn’t. But he knows his equations work for any pair of objects. How do you reconcile that? God steps in and corrects things every every now and then. That’s in his book! It is the God of the gaps intelligent design argument. He got to the limits of his brilliance. Put  God in and said God fixes it. There you have it.\n\nFast forward a bit and Tyson tells us how [Laplace, not having God on the brain, was able to develop perturbation theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vfOpZD4Sm8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3670)\n\n\n&gt;Laplace looked at Newton’s problem and said that’s kind of cool. I wonder if I can solve that.  This multi-body problem where everybody's tugging on everybody else but there’s one main force of gravity at work. So he writes a five volume tome  called “Celestial Mechanics”. And in there he pioneers perturbation theory. That’s the theory we have one main force and  other little tugs. How do you treat that mathematically? He pioneers that, solves it  for the solar system, demonstrates that the solar system is stable -- far beyond anything Newton had imagined.\n\n&gt;This work was called up Napoleon. Napoleon was not only everything we know him to be, he was a great reader of  mechanics and physics books so that he would know not only how to make the cannonball, he would know where the cannonball would hit when he shot it. And so he summoned up this five volume tome, read it, said to Laplace  “this is a brilliant piece of work. But you make no mention of  the architect of the system”, making direct reference back to Isaac Newton. And Laplace’s reply was “Sir, I had no need for that hypothesis” \n\n&gt;So what worries me is had Newton not stopped and ceded his brilliance to God, he could have easily come up with perturbation theory. Newton invented calculus practically on a dare. Perturbation theory’s just an extension of calculus. Perturbation theory? it’s a nice elegant extension but you know Newton could have knocked this out in an afternoon. You know this. Okay!\n\n&gt;So my problem is not that  people have invoked intelligent design. Brilliant people have done it before. They'll keep doing it. I don't have an issue with that.  I worry if it prevents you from making further discoveries. I don't want the intelligent design person to be the one looking for the cure for Alzheimer’s. Because they’ll get to their  ignorance and say not only can I not figure it this out but no one else in the lab will -- no one else will ever be born will figure this out.  It is intelligently designed.  Then that person is removed from the set of people who would solve that problem.\n\n____\n\nFirst off, Newton did not invent calculus on a dare. [An earlier post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8pbdff/the_continued_bad_history_of_neil_degrasse_tyson/) to r/badhistory examined this claim.  Most of my earlier post to this subreddit was based [this article by Thony Christie]( https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2017/06/14/why-doesnt-he-just-shut-up/)\n\nNewton certainly made contributions to calculus. But not because of Halley’s “dare”. Halley asked Newton about elliptical orbits when Newton was 41. [Isaac Barrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barrow) was one of Newton’s teachers. Barrow, Fermat, Cavalieri and others had already laid the foundations of calculus in the generation before Newton and Leibniz. Newton’s calculus work was likely further development of the ideas introduced to him by Barrow.\n\n_____\n\nThe rest of this post borrows a lot from astrophysicist Luke Barns’ article [Neil deGrasse Tyson on Isaac Newton (Part 1)](https://letterstonature.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/neil-degrasse-tyson-on-newton-part-1/)\n\nCould Newton have easily done Laplace's n-body perturbation theory in an afternoon? No. From [William L. Harper's book on Isaac Newton](https://www.amazon.com/Isaac-Newtons-Scientific-Method-Cosmology/dp/019957040X):\n\n&gt;... Newton developed this method in an effort to deal with the extreme complexity of solar system motions. . . . The passage continues with the following characterization of the extraordinary complexity of these resulting motions:\n\n&gt;”By reason of the deviation of the Sun from the center of gravity, the centripetal force does not always tend to that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in ellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit. There are as many orbits of a planet as it has revolutions, as in the motion of the Moon, and the orbit of any one planet depends on the combined motion of all the planets, not to mention the action of all these on each other. But to consider simultaneously all these causes of motion and to define these motions by exact laws admitting of easy calculation exceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind.” (Wilson 1989b, 253)\n\n&gt;**It appears that shortly after articulating this daunting complexity problem, Newton was hard at work developing resources for responding to it with successive approximations.** The development and applications of perturbation theory, from Newton through Laplace at the turn of the nineteenth century and on through much of the work of Simon Newcomb at the turn of the twentieth, led to successive, increasingly accurate corrections of Keplerian planetary orbital motions. \n\n(emphasis added)\n\nIt’s obvious that Newton invested considerable time and effort attempting to model n-body systems. The claim that he could have easily done Laplace’s work in an afternoon is demonstrably false from the get go.\n\nAnd the stability of the solar system system wasn’t just examined by Newton. This problem was scrutinized by many very able mathematicians.\n\nFrom [Karol Zyczkowski’s “On the Stability of the solar system”](http://www.cft.edu.pl/edu/karol/003.pdf):\n\n&gt;The description of motion of planets on the sky was one of the main problems, which stimulated advances of the natural sciences over the centuries. Decisive discoveries explaining the rules governing the motion of planets were made by the founding fathers of contemporary astronomy, mathematics, and physics, including Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. While celestial mechanics of any two bodies, interacting by the gravitational force, is well understood, the famous three body problem is by far more complex.\n \n&gt;Although important partial results were obtained during the last three centuries by Leonard Euler (1707-1783), Louis Lagrange (1736-1813), C.G. Jacobi (1804-1851), George W. Hill (1938- 1914), Henri Poincare (1854-1912), Tullio Levi-Civita (1873-1941), George D. Birkhoff (1884-1944) and many others, the general problem of solving the dynamics of three interacting bodies cannot be solved analytically, and one needs to rely on numerical methods. Even a simplified version of the model, the so-called restricted three body problem, in which the mass of one body is negligible in comparison with the total mass of the system, may exhibit complicated dynamics. \n\nThe [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point#History) are a well known result of Euler and Lagrange’s work on the 3-body problem. Euler and Lagrange had discovered 5 points where the gravity of the central body, orbiting body and centrifugal force all cancel. \n\nFrom [Luke Barnes](https://letterstonature.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/neil-degrasse-tyson-on-newton-part-1/):\n\n\n&gt; Why was Newton’s calculation unsuccessful? Was he too busy “basking in the majesty” Historians have a more mundane explanation.\n&gt; \n&gt;”The first successful derivation of the Moon's apsidal motion (or rather, of most of it) was announced some sixty years later, by Alexis-Claude Clairaut, in May 1749. Euler obtainedˇa derivation in good agreement with Clairaut's by mid-1751. . . . Jean le Rond d'Alembert published a more perspicuous derivation, with the degree of approximation made explicit, in 1754. Success came for Newton's successors only with a new approach, different from any he had envisaged: algorithmic and global. The Continental mathematicians began with the differential equation, the bequest of Leibniz.”\n\nA little later Barnes writes:\n\n&gt; The idea that Newton could have come to the conclusions that Laplace did is extremely doubtful. We have already seen that his methods are not quite up to the task. Further, note the mathematicians who worked on the problem of perturbations to planetary orbits before Laplace:Clairaut, Euler, d’Alembert, and Lagrange. These are the greatest mathematicians of their age; Leonard Euler is arguably the greatest mathematician of all time: “Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.” That quote, incidentally, is from Laplace. \n\n____\n\nTL;DR It took an all-star team of great mathematicians more than a 100 years to develop n-body perturbation theory. Tyson’s claim that Newton could have easily done it an afternoon is ignorant and clueless.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/906sv1/the_saxons_in_2004s_king_arthur_insert_saxon/",
        "text": "Heyhey. first post here, I'm going to be looking at the so-called 'Saxons' from the 2004 King Arthur film starring Clive Owen. Sporadic spoilers below. And oh boy, this is a shitshow. I'm not even touching the rest of this clusterfuck. I adore this film, but definitely in a 'guilty pleasure' kinda way. \n\nFrankly I'm not really sure why I enjoy this movie so much, it's pretty much badhistory all the way through. I didn't get into the 'who was king Arthur/was there a 'real' king Arthur' debate here, or the debunked 'Sarmatian knight' theory, or the dumb logic of a prosperous Roman family living north of the wall, or why the 'Woads' (who are probably meant to be Picts) have trebuchets, or how Pelagius was apparently executed for heresy, or Lancelot dual-wielding, or really pretty much anything in the movie. This film will always be a goldmine for badhistory, but the Anglo-Saxons are my speciality so I figured I'd focus on them first.\n\nSo most of the historical sources for this period were written quite some time after the actual 'Anglo-Saxon arrival', and all the later ones tend to draw on the former ones and sometimes add stuff in, making it super hard to tell what's just being made up and what's an actual recorded tradition from the period, so 'actual history' is a bit of a mess. Not to mention there's a bunch of scholarly debate about how many Anglo-Saxons actually landed, and whether there was really an 'invasion' at all or just a series of mostly cultural migrations which involved some violence between different areas, but not in an ethnic Saxon v. Romano-British type way. Suffice it to say, there's no clear answer. What I can tell you is that basically everything about these King Arthur 'Saxons' is total BS.\n\nSo right off the bat, the Saxons are apparently landing 'north of the wall'. No. No they're not. The first 'Saxon' arrivals, as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records, were in the south. The earliest Germanic arrivals are supposed to have been invited over after the Romans left as mercenaries and settled somewhere in the east (later tradition makes it Thanet in Kent, in the south-east, though the guys there were apparently Jutes rather than Saxons). There were some landings in the north, though not really 'north of the wall' - and they were 'Angles', at least according to Bede's Ecclesiastical History. Scholars have questioned whether the tribal divisions were really that big a thing and whether Bede was exaggerating, but it's pretty certain that whatever the people landing in modern Northumbria called themselves, it wasn't 'Saxons'.\n\nAlso these Saxons are pretty much your generic furry barbarians with big axes and stupid armour. They look nothing like actual Saxons, and might as well have been imported from any generic fantasy setting. It's pretty lazy.\n\nEventually we're introduced to the Big Bad of the movie, and while his name is never said in the movie, the credits tell us he is 'Cerdic'. Which makes the northern landing even more stupid. Cerdic (who may or may not have ever actually existed historically) is recorded by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as landing in the south in 495, and fighting against 'the Welsh', who were certainly not in Scotland. His band weren't even the first Saxons to arrive, even discounting the supposed other tribe of 'Jutes' under Hengist who landed in Kent. In fact Cerdic was about twenty to forty years too late to be the first Saxon to land, as another Saxon leader called Aelle supposedly got to Britain in 477. (All of this also discounts the numbers of Saxon mercenaries employed by Rome who might have stayed on after the legions withdrew, but they weren't invading.)\n\nCerdic is stalking about as his generic barbarian men generically pillage and set fire to some generic local village. One of his men starts dragging off a local woman to do some generic barbarian raping, but Cerdic stops him, with the logic of 'We don't mix with these people. We don't want our Saxon blood watered down'. Which is bad enough because the idea that the Saxons just killed and drove out the Romano-British has basically totally been debunked, and has some unfortunate 'pure Germanic Saxon ethnicity' overtones but is doubley-bad coming from Cerdic in particular. Because, you see, Cerdic is a British name. A BRITISH name. And when I say 'British' I mean Romano-British, in the 'the people who were here before the Saxons'-kinda way. In fact, loads of Cerdic's immediate descendants also had British or British-inspired names. Nobody is quite sure why, and there's a bunch of theories about him maybe being half-British, or something of that sort, but in any case, he is the last person who should be arguing about 'pure Saxon blood'.\n\nThe would-be rapist also has a dumb line about 'according to our laws, no man may deny me the spoils of conquest', which, given that early Anglo-Saxon chieftains and kings were totally in charge of distributing the spoils of war to their followers, seems highly unlikely. Also Cerdic then just kills the would-be rapist and does a 'while I'm in charge, what I say goes', which is reasonably plausible but makes you wonder why the dead guy brought up 'the laws' anyway if nobody cares about them.\n\nBonus round: dumbshit Saxon weaponry. The Saxons have CROSSBOWS for some reason. They didn't use crossbows, they probably barely used bows at all, but they certainly didn't use crossbows. And also Cerdic has a nice big generic double-headed axe. Why?? There were no military double-headed axes at all ever, and even if there were, the only axes used by early period Anglo-Saxons were fransiscas, a kind of throwing axe. None of the Saxons use spears for some reason, and while Cerdic has a nice knife which, while looking kinda Celtic, is at least vaguely appropriate for the period, his sword, while appropriately Anglo-Saxon, is of the lobed pommel kind, which is from several centuries later.\n\nEventually, after an awful lot of Saxon bullshitting about which isn't really any more historically inaccurate so much as just stupid, there's a big Final Battle. The voiceover at the end tells us this is 'the Battle of Badon Hill'. It's not. This is nothing to do with Badon Hill. Because\n1) in the earliest account mentioning Badon, the battle of Badon Hill is the 'siege of Badon Hill', and there are definitely no notable hills and no besieging going on at all here. \n2) Badon Hill is usually thought to have been in the south, maybe at Bath, though to be fair to the film this is at least reasonably uncertain. \nOn a side-note, the oldest accounts credit a guy called Aurelius Ambrosius with the victory, and 'Arthur' only gets the credit several centuries later.\n\nAnd, SPOILERS to cap the stupidity all off, Cerdic (and his son) die. With, as far as we can tell, no children. Which is a bit of a problem when this is the guy that all the kings of Wessex, up to and including Ecgberht, Aethelwulf, Alfred the Great and so on claim descent from. Arthur has not only managed to destroy the Saxon menace, he's also killed off England altogether. \n\nSources:\nGildas, The Ruin of Britain:  http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1949/pg1949.html \nBede, The Ecclesiastical History: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: http://omacl.org/Anglo/part1.html \nH.

        "author": "Cookielolz",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8zz3hc/paradox_forums_on_eu4_the_french_revolution_was_a/",
        "text": "Hey folks, first post so please be gentle! So I probably don’t need to explain but tl;dr Paradox Forums is full of pseudo-historians who think video games = academic standard education and EU4 is but one of many Paradox games that suffers from this I-Am-Very-Smart community.\n\nTo begin with, I was disappointed because I couldn’t find the thread full of crazy I wanted to write about because it was either deleted or removed. This is most likely because one user’s eurocentrism went all-out racist (*sighs*, again) and spiralled it out of control at one point. Thankfully however, I record usable material in a notepad to later check without being angry at whoever said it, so I have just about enough to work with for a full post! So without further ado, let’s get this ball rolling.\n\n(Disclaimer: Technically the revolution ended in 1799, but I'll be looking at Napoleonic Bad History too.)\n\n.\n\nOur story begins with OP, asking for improvements to make the French Revolution more accurate in gameplay, all well and good. First problem comes when they mention:\n\n&gt;Maybe have a special Bastille modifier in Maine and have peasants demolish it in 1792, starting up tensions leading to the revolution?\n\nProblem is, the revolution started in 1789, with critical events like the establishing of the National Assembly, storming of the Bastille and Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. Maybe they were confused by the in-game bookmark of 1792, but even that seems to explain well enough that it’s midway through the revolution.\n\nThen there’s what seems to be confusion about how the revolution began. The storming of the Bastille didn’t start the revolution, it began when the Third Estate declared itself the National Assembly at the Estates-General in 1789, which then led to the series of events that caused the storming of the Bastille. Also, minor detail: Peasants also didn’t magically demolish a medieval fortress in a single afternoon, armed or otherwise, construction workers took it down a while after it was stormed.\n\nDid I mention *the Bastille was in Paris and not Maine?*\n\n.\n\nThen we have:\n\n&gt;I don’t get why Paradox can’t work more on this. I know the game ends like 30 years after the event but it’s the only significant uprising in European history prior to the 19th century. It introduced so many changes that abolished inequalities in all socioeconomic groups and promoted these ideals to the rest of the world!\n\nYikes, that’s a big mess to debunk. Let’s start with significant uprising: There are near infinite rebellions to list but I’ll go off the top of my head with the big ones: Hussites, German Peasants’ War and English Civil War. Granted, some of those had military support at some stages, but peasant uprisings weren’t exactly a myth.\n\nThen we have abolishing inequalities. First, I’ll give them some credit, things like the August Decrees which abolished the feudal rights of the nobility and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen which replaced the divine right of kings with a notion of popular sovereignty were certainly good for equality. Problem is, the equality isn’t exactly universal. Despite it’s claims, the revolution remained largely male-centred and the Declaration of Rights failed to account for women’s rights, a fact that didn’t sit well with them considering they played a vital role in key events like the October March and that whole being 50% of the population thing. Olympe de Gouges did try writing a Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen in 1791 and passed it along to the National Assembly but they didn’t care because fraternité ≠ sororité.\n\nThen we have slavery, despite the constitution claiming men are ‘born and remain free’, it did not abolish slavery or extend any rights towards people of colour. Needless to say this didn’t go down well, in 1790 free men of colour in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti) demanded they receive the rights in the constitution because they were French citizens, refusal of this demand led to the Haitian revolution in 1791 and subsequently the abolition of slavery across French colonies in 1794. Or so you’d think, but Napoleon revoked the decree in 1802, delaying abolition till post-Napoleonic Wars.\n\nEdit: Thanks to u/Tankatan and u/Elphinstone1842 for extending this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8zz3hc/paradox_forums_on_eu4_the_french_revolution_was_a/e2mkeo0)\n\nFinally we have The Terror, where upwards of 16,000 executions took place against the clergy and nobility, mostly for opposing revolutionary ideals. A government that exterminates opposing political views isn’t doing a good job of promoting equality.\n\n.\n\nNext, we get into alternate history because yes:\n\n&gt;How about an alliance between the US and France? They both fought the British in that time period together after all.\n\nWhat? Closest thing I can think of is that this user mistook the War of 1812 between the US and British as an indication of pro-French, except that war was mostly caused by British naval blockades and press ganging. Washington made it clear in 1793 that US citizens participating in the war were violating the law, the US government was eager to avoid war at all costs because the nation literally gained independence no more than 20 years ago, a situation in which war probably isn’t the best idea.\n\n.\n\nThen, a user discussed how conservatives in Britain objected to the revolution with religion in mind, to which another user went:\n\n&gt;WTF is with you leftists thinking all conservatives are religious nutjobs, in what way is religion relevant to this?\n\nThis user has of course forgotten that this is a historical context. When looking at the early days of conservatism, religion is certainly a part of the existing order that people sought to uphold. Among critics of the revolution is Edmund Burke, often considered the founder of modern conservative thought. Burke denounced natural rights, claiming inequality was natural and so nobody was entitled to equal shares of political power, the revolutionaries were rejecting the laws of God and placing their faith in arrogant ideas of rationality and reasoning put forth by the enlightenment. Of course, that’s paraphrasing, I recommend anyone interested to read Reflections on the Revolution in France.\n\n.\n\nThen there’s this:\n\n&gt;Monarchs across Europe despised the whole liberty thing, but the revolution was really popular among their populations.\n\nThis is not completely true, because of the magical word ‘propaganda’ influencing the views of most people. Political thinkers like the aforementioned Edmund Burke argued that abstract general principles and reforms based on speculative theories would lead to political upheaval and social anarchy, needless to say their point wasn’t difficult to argue with the state of revolutionary France being as chaotic as it was.\n\nBeyond this, there was more literal propaganda distributed by wealthy elites in society, such as Cheap Repository Tracts by Hannah More (I recommend checking this out, it’s amusing), a collection of short stories teaching the dangers of rioting and attempting to improve your social status. Then there’s organised groups like The Association for the Preservation of Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers which coordinated with over 200 affiliated regional offshoots to help circulate conservative propaganda.\n\nThen there’s the British government, which sponsored journalists to propagate counter-revolutionary messages in the press, while also hiring spies to attend radical meetings to then exaggerate reports to accuse them of treason. They were also paranoid enough to clamp down on significantly more moderate reform groups like the London Corresponding Society because universal suffrage sounded suspiciously like the words of a Jacobin.\n\nOn the subject of monarchs despising liberty, it’s unreasonable to generalise that all European monarchs were tyrants who sought to oppress their peoples. If anything in the revolution was objectionable to monarchs around Europe, it’s most likely the part where they lose all their political power and potentially end up beheaded, so frowning upon the revolution is hardly unusual in their position.\n\n.\n\nNext is some back and forth about whether the revolution was good, which is pretty common since there’s a lot to this whole period that makes it hard to reach a good or bad on. Problem is, some people think they’re good enough to reach a conclusion anyway:\n\n&gt;Man, the revolution was pretty damn good, but then Napoleon had to come over and oppress everyone all over again. But even so, he was pretty progressive, and some modern countries could really learn a thing or two.\n\nFirst of all, virtually all modern countries forbid slavery, pretty good considering Napoleon repealed the decree that already abolished it. Secondly, Napoleon wasn’t just another oppressive pseudo-monarchical tyrant, he promoted some pretty good stuff too.\n\nThe Napoleonic Code was drafted using a combination of existing revolutionary laws like personal freedoms and due process, as well as provisions relating to rule of law and its application. If that isn’t convincing, over 70 modern countries are estimated to have been inspired by it such as Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. But yes, it was still a bit inadequate, legal power in some areas like property ownership, divorces and child custody remained with men.\n\n.\n\nFinally, at the pinnacle of bad history, there is this:\n\n&gt;Napoleon may have been a shorty, but his brain was sure as hell a giant’s.\n\n*sighs* just look at [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)*.*\n\n.\n\nSources:\n\n*L’Ancien Régime et la Révolution* – Alexis de Tocqueville\n\n*Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution* – Simon Schama\n\n*Reflections on the Revolution in France* – Edmund Burke\n\n*The* *Napoleonic Revolution* – Robert B.

        "text": "[This video](https://i.imgur.com/sKehBNC.png) keeps showing up in my Youtube suggestions. If you know anything about the Ancient History community on Youtube, you know that it is a cesspit of nationalism, Great-Man Theory, and an almost exclusive focus on Political and Military history. So when I found out that a Youtuber had made a 21 minute video on the History of Rome, I had a sneaking suspicion it wouldn't be especially well researched.\n\nOh boy was I ever right.\n\n#INTRODUCTION\n\n0:10\n\nThis [map](https://i.imgur.com/Ylj3wgo.png) of Romance language speaking countries is based on its official status in government, not neccesarily where such languages are spoken. Niger, for instance, is primarily populated of Hausa and Songhai speakers. Only about 1/5 of the population speaks French, and almost all of that knowledge is of French as a second language not spoken at home. Burundi is the worst offender on the map, colored in despite less than 1/10 people speaking French as a second language. \n\nBelize and the United States in particular are home to very large communities of native Spanish speakers--if Canada is colored in for its Quebecois, both the US and Belize should be colored in as well. If second languages count, then Tunisia and large parts of Central Europe and North Africa should also be colored in--French being widely studied.\n\n0:16\n\n[This map](https://i.imgur.com/SrWrywt.png) appears to show the Roman Empire at its territorial height under Trajan, but excludes Armenia.\n\n0:22\n\n&gt;_\"Pax Romana serves as the first example of globalization.\"\n\nWhat?? Not even the first example in Europe. Globalization, in the sense of trade goods, ideas, and technologies, spreading through international trade, has been going on since the LAST ICE AGE.* (Debatable, see /u/Little_hat_logan's) comment. Evidence of goods being traded over long distance can be found in archaeological sites of Japan, New Guinea, and the Danube River Valley, in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The Roman Empire was extremely influential in the development of European society, but to call it the first instance of globalization is laughable.\n\n#THE ROMAN KINGDOM\n\n1:17\n\n&gt;\"From the very start, Rome has been an open city for outcasts, murderers, runaway slaves.\"\n\nThis is an unverifiable legend largely based on Livy's \"History of Rome\", written 7 centuries after the fact.\n\n1:23\n\n&gt;\"Rome offered migrants a unique opportunity to become fully fledged citizens.\"\n\nThe concept of citizenship doesn't appear in either Roman or Greek traditions until the 5th century BC. Even when it would appear, not just anyone could become a Roman citizen with full legal rights. Women and freedmen (former slaves) did not have all of the rights afforded to adult men. Slaves lacked legal rights entirely.\n\n1:28\n\n&gt;\"This will make Rome the largest metropolitan city of the ancient world.\"\n\nRome wouldn't become one of Europe's largest cities until the 2nd century BC.\n\nBut if Roman citizenship and legal rights are the reason it was so powerful, then perhaps we should be speaking of the Athenian Empire's domination of the Mediterraenean. Same legal rights, larger population in the 5th century. As any follower of New Institutional Economics will tell you, open institutions drive growth, but they are far from the only factor.\n\nRome's early growth was driven by its position for global trade--being located ~~at~~ near the mouth of the Tiber river--defensible terrain, and most importantly, access to arable land. Just the virtue of having semi-free institutions in a sea of countries with less free institutions doesn't mean inherent runaway growth. Mongolia, with some of the freest institutions in Eastern Asia, is sandwiched between authoritarian Russia and China. The Mongolian GDP per Capita is lower than both, and has been steadily shrinking for years.\n\n1:58\n\n&gt;\"(during the Roman Kingdom)...A calendar\"\n\nMentions of the Romulan Calendar system don't appear until the Late Republican era, there are no surviving records of this calendar when it was said to have been used. The image of the calendar shown in the video is the Fasti Praenestini, written during the Reign of Augustus--more than 5 centuries after the birth of the Republic. \n\n2:04\n\n&gt;\"Much of what the Romans later became famous for aqueducts, bridges, perhaps even the gladitorial games, were borrowed from the Etruscans.\"\n\nRoman aqueduct and bridge engineering were derived from Greek cities, not the Etruscans. Additionally, the Roman Aqueduct system wouldn't come into being until the late 4th century BC, well after the establishment of the Republic.\n\nThe only source suggesting that the gladiatorial games came from the Etruscuans is Nicolaus of Damascus, writing centuries later. Most scholars support an origin in Campania sometime in the 4th century BC.\n\n2:13\n\n&gt;\"These people (the Etruscans) invented the Latin alphabet\"\n\nWhile the Etruscan alphabet influenced the development of the Latin alphabet, they were not the same writing system. The Latin and Etruscan alphabets are both primarily derived from the Euboean Alphabet used by Greek colonists in Southern Italy. At the time of the earliest Latin alphabet, Etruscan people had heavily settled Rome, but attributing the alphabet to the Etruscans entirely is highly misleading.\n\n2:20\n\n&gt;\"It's no surprise that Rome's last kings were Etruscan.\"\n\nOnce again treating Livy's description of the kingdom as verified fact.\n\n2:23\n\n&gt;\"Rome borrowed her military and government organization from them, while maintaing her stern, patriarchal simplicity\"\n\nSaying that the Roman Kingdom was based on Etruscan governance is misleading on two accounts. First, that little is known of the Roman Kingdom's government structure, and that second, even less is known of the governments of the Etruscans. If the video is referring to the Latin League and comparing it to the Etruscan League, it begs mention that similar leagues already existed in Greece. \n\nIt's quite possible that the Romans adopted their early military organization from the Etruscans, but again, the Etruscan hoplite structure was in turn derived from the Greeks. Further, it seems that the video is making this claim based on the Legends of the seven Roman Kings, which haven't been verified by archaeology.\n\nNo clue what the video even means by Romans having a \"stern, patriarchal simplicity.\"\n\n2:28-2:40\n\n&gt;(Brief summary of the Overthrow of the Roman Kingdom as described by Livy)\n\nWhile the existence of a Roman Kingdom is supported, specifics about the kings or their downfall are not. While the story of the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom is at least somewhat plausible, there also isn't any contemporary evidence for it.\n\n#EARLY ROMAN REPUBLIC\n\n2:42\n\n[...is that a manhole cover?](https://i.imgur.com/812kdYc.png)\n\n2:48\n\n&gt;\"The Romans decided to prevent any such concentration of power ever again. From 509 onwards, they elected two consuls to serve one year apiece.\"\n\nThe 509 BC date for the beginning of the Roman Republic is suspect. This places the beginning of the Republic one year before the democratic reforms of Cleisthenes of Athens. Maybe it's just a coincidence and the Roman Republic really did predate Athenian Democracy, but in all likelihood, the Romans were just trying to steal the Athenians' thunder.\n\nConsuls served at the same time, not one year apiece. Most of the channel is in Russian, so I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt and assume this was just a grammatical error.\n\n3:29\n\n&gt;\"The publians...would threaten the fledgling state with emigration to a neighboring ville\"\n\nReferences to the \"Seccession of the Plebs\" are scarce. The nature and timing of these events is hotly contested among scholars today, and while unquestioned acceptance of Livy's account makes for easy storytelling, it doesn't give a very accurate understanding of history.\n\n3:58\n\n&gt;\"The unity of Rome found its best expression in the formula 'Senatus Populusque Romanus', the Senate and the People of Rome...\"\n\nThe earliest inscription of \"SPQR\" is dated to around 80BC--it was hardly inspired by the Plebian victory in the Conflict of Orders. Roman coins from the Republican period (starting in the early 3rd century BC) use 'ROMANUM', not 'SPQR.' \n\n4:05\n\n&gt;\"...which still adorns the manhole covers in Rome today.\"\n\nJesus tapdancing christ! Roman 'SPQR' Manhole covers were made in the 1930s, not the Roman Republic! The Roman Republic didn't even have manholes! Incredible. Truly incredible. The fascist architecture of Mussolini's Italy used to characterize the Roman Republic. AMAZING JOB SIR. GREAT DOCUMENTARY.\n\n#MID ROMAN REPUBLIC\n\n4:22\n\n&gt;\"The guard dogs sensed no danger, for which they were crucified every year sense\"\n\n~~I'm not sure that the 'Punishment of the Dogs' was crucifixion, there is apparently not much literature on the subject. Dogs were tied to crosses, but I could find no mention of them being nailed to the cross of left to die in the ceremony.~~ (thanks for the correction /u/Elphinstone1842)\n\n4:32\n\n&gt;\"The shaken Romans conducted a military reform, divided into Manipuli.\"\n\nThe Manipular Legions were first organized after the Samnite Wars in 290 BC, not after the Sack of Rome 100 years earlier. The Roman military reforms are entirely unrelated to the sack.\n\n4:42\n\n&gt;\"The Roman army spent the next hundred years in constant wars.\"\n\nThe expansion of Rome was not driven by the Manipular Legions (see above). This was hardly a period of constant warfare. For the majority of the 370s and 340s, as well as the entirity of the 330s, Rome was at peace.\n\n4:52\n\n&gt;\"And the loyal allies...\n\nThe Roman _socii_ were not always loyal. Several defected to Pyrrhus during the Pyrrhic War, and others to Carthage during the Second Punic War.\n\n4:57\n\n&gt;\"Thanks to this (Socii system) the Roman legions were able to stand their ground against the most efficient fighting force of the time (Pyrrhus).\"\n\nThe manpower advantage of the Roman Army in the Pyrrhic War had more to do with demography than political oganization. Epirus was a fairly small Greek kingdom whose strategy relied heavily on attracting the loyalty of Southern Italian city states, which were not at all reliable. Rome in 280 BC directly controlled all of Central Italy, giving them a massive advantage in manpower. Carthaginian Intervention in 279 BC made Pyrrhus's position much more dire. Roman victory in the Pyrrhic War was just as much the result of Carthaginian support and Epiran incompetence as it was of Roman military prowess.\n\nAlso, by what metric is Pyrrhus's army judged as the \"most powerful and efficient\" fighting force? \n\n5:04\n\n&gt;\"...the all conquering Macedonian phalanx, led by Pyrrhus, a relative of Alexander the Great.\"\n\nPyrrhus was not Macedonian* (in the sense that he was not born in Macedonia, and was not primarily of Macedonian descdent. He was a distant relative of Alexander through his Macedonian grandmother, and would on two ocassions hold Macedonia by military force.), ~~nor was the phalanx of Macedonian origin~~ (The Macedonian phalanx was. I fucked up my Greek history here). Ancient Macedonia and Epirus were both small Greek kingdoms. ~~The Hoplite Phalanx originated in the 7th century BC and was common throughout Greece and Italy in the early 3rd century BC. The Romans themselves had used it starting in the early Republican era until the introduction of the Manipold in 290 BC.~~\n\n5:16\n\n&gt;\"The Greek City of Tarentum then hired the most costly and celebrated contemporary warlord of the time, to defend against Roman expansion.\"\n\nPyrrhus was not exactly the hired hand of Tarentum, but he did use the request from Tarentum as a justification for intervention in Italy. Pyrrhus had long held ambitions for his own control of Southern Italy--he was by all means seeking conquests of his own, not just hoping to contain the expansion of Rome.\n\n5:28\n\n&gt;\"Rome now had to take on a much more dangerous adversary, Carthage.\"\n\nRome and Carthage were not blood enemies enemies in 272 BC--hell, they had both just fought in a war together! Carthaginians and Romans had actively traded with eachother for centuries, and had somewhat amiable diplomatic relations with eachother. Conflicting interests in Sicily led to diplomatic rivalry and open conflict in 264 BC, but war probably wasn't doomed to occur just because Rome controlled Calabria.\n\n5:37\n\n&gt;\"they were fought for the next hundred years.\"\n\nThe implication that there was a century of near constant war between Rome and Carthage is laughable. Rome and Carthage were at war for \"just\" 40 of the 100 years between 272 and 172 BC, specifically from 264-241 BC and 218-201 BC.\n\n5:43\n\n&gt;\"Rome had taken the greater part of Punic territory.\"\n\nIn terms of land? Sure. In terms of population? Absolutely not. The Carthaginian population had always been centered around modern Tunisia, and while the mineral resources of Iberia were of great importance to the Carthaginian economy, the extent of settlement was limited. Carthaginian Iberia was culturally diverse, primarily inhabited by Native Iberians, but with Carthaginian and Greek descended inhabitants as well. With the exception of the long-held southern coast, Carthaginian Iberia was very young at the time of Roman Conquest in 201 BC--having been expanded by an 8 year long series of conquests between 236 and 228 BC.\n\n5:44\n\n[Bad map](https://i.imgur.com/03uPJIS.png)\n\nThe Balearic Islands were not conquered until 123 BC. Leaving Macedonia out is forgivable as the client state was in revolt at the time, but Early 2nd century BC Roman campaigns in the Balkans deserve a mention.\n\n5:50\n\n&gt;\"but after each defeat, the power of Carthage would rapidly recover.\"\n\nCarthage never fully recovered from the First and Second Punic Wars. It was made to pay harsh reparations to Rome until 151 BC, and no longer controlled trade routes across the Western Mediterraenean. The city and its inhabitants had largely recovered after decades of peace (I wouldn't call 50 years \"quick\"), but Carthage posed no serious threat to Rome. The Third Punic War was predicated on the ability to continue to use Carthage as a source of government income following the expiration of the Peace Treaty, as well as to attain the valuable farmland of Carthage and its surroundings.\n\n5:56\n\n&gt;\"Cato the Elder began to finish up his speakers with the same refrain, 'Carthage must be destroyed!' so it was done\"\n\nCato's jingoistic arguments (which were frankly bullshit) were hotly debated within the Senate for several years, and their influence on the decision to wage the Third Punic War is unclear. Further control of trade (and the wealth it brought), increased food supply (especially in light of Rome's rapidly growing population), and political power, all factored into the decision to invade Carthage. \n\nSidenote (~5:30-6:00)\n\nReally weird to have the first two Punic Wars reduced to a few sentences, when their impact on Roman culture and demography were massive, while giving a comparatively large discussion of the much less significant Third Punic War. There are also no discussion of the challenges faced by the Romans in establishing dominion over either the Balkans or Iberia, or the role of Numidians in this. They don't even mention Hannibal by name! \n\n6:02\n\n&gt;\"The city was wiped out, all of its population was enslaved, allegedly pouring salt into the air as an eternal curse.\"\n\nMost of the population was killed, not enslaved--this was wholesale genocide. That the Romans \"salted the Earth\" is an invention of 19th century history writers--much like the myths that \"Medieval Europeans thought the Earth was flat.\" It's not a Roman Legend.\n\nIt should be further noted that while city of Carthage was destroyed, the Carthaginian people as a whole were not. Punic people would continue to practice the punic religion, speaking the punic language, until the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.\n\n6:14\n\n&gt;\"Rome wiped out another city, Corinth, making Greece and Macedonia Roman provinces.\"\n\nMacedonia had already been a Roman province for decades by this point, other than the aforementioned rebellion from 150 to 148 BC.\n\n6:24\n\n&gt;\"But the patriarchal simplicity of Rome succumbed to the sophisticated Greek culture. Greek became in effect a second state language, the Roman nobility busied itself learning new (loan) words\n\nThe \"Patriarchal Simplicity\" of Rome succumbed to \"Sophisticated Greek Culture\"?? While Greek influence on Roman culture was massive, there was no wholesale shift in the culture from that of Barbarian Italians to that of Civilized Greeks--Greeks had been influencing Roman culture from the moment Greek traders interacted with Italians in the 7th century BC. Further, to say that Roman culture up until 146 BC was 'simple' is laughable, and, Greek culture was heavily patriarchal as well.\n\nThe Greek language was never official in the Roman Republic. Greek had been influencing the Latin language for centuries by this point, and attributing the origin of Greek loan words exclusively to the conquest\n\n6:52\n\n&gt;\"These (non-citizens) would demand equality, declare war, and win the right to take part in managing the state.\"\n\nThis is true in a broad sense, but there was little mass demand for Roman citizenship. Rome lacked the administrative tools and technologies to establish a hyper-authoritarian colonial empire, and while non-Romans (and non-Italians especially) lacked several priviledges granted to Roman citizens, this had little to no bearing on the lives of most people.\n\nBy far the most significant impact of this distinction was in the legal Roman seizure of farmland, which often meant that non-citizen farm workers were relegated to become tenant farmers. There was no great mass-action political movement of the Peregrini, just as there wasn't a movement among the slaves to attain freedom, or a movement among the laborers to seize the means of production.\n\nAlso, the Social War (which established citizenship for all Italians) wouldn't occur for another 50 years. Citizenship rights were not granted to most non-Italians for over 300.\n\n7:05\n\n&gt;\"Rome gradually extended citizenship rights to the conquered.\"\n\n\"Gradually\" is putting it very, very mildly. Gaining citizenship in the Roman Republic was only granted in exceptional circumstances. Even during the Roman Empire, a non-citizen couldn't count on gaining citizenship unless they enlisted in the Roman Army for 25 years. Considering how little citizenship meant in day-to-day life, that pathway to citizenship wasn't nearly enough to grant legal rights to the people of the Empire. \n\nThe vast majority of Romans were non-citizens until Caracalla granted citizenship rights to the entire non-slave population in 212 AD. Citizenship was not a viable option for most people in the Empire--and hardly viable for ANYONE in the Republic. To say that the ability of non-Romans to gain citizenship was the basis of the Roman Empire is just silly. \n\nWell, here we are. 1/3 of the way through a 21 minute video, and over 2000 words of bad history. It is 146 BC, and the Roman Republic is at its peak. Unfortunately, much as the Roman Republic declined from this peak, so too does the accuracy of this video. Somehow, it only gets worse from here. I'll have that done another day.",

        "text": "[Link to Video](https://youtu.be/b2q5pVPrFiw?t=3m57s)- Bad history starts at 3:57 and lasts until about 5:30\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHello fellow historians! Today I will be examining a video from a frequent creator of bad history, Alt-Right youtuber Brooks Heatherly of the No Bullshit channel. In Brooks’ video entitled Bill Nye the Science Goy Rewrites History, a video in which Brooks steals an idea from youtuber RageAfterStorm and makes fun of Bill Nye by calling him Jewish, Brooks starts a new segment entitled “Check this Shit Out”. In this short segment Brooks discusses the number of slaves imported into the United States and attempts to use this data to say that “SJW’s rewrite history”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore we actually discuss what Brooks gets wrong, it’s important to address what Brooks is trying to do with this data. His motives can plainly be seen in his statement “to me it always seems the amount of slaves and their impact is always overblown” which signals that with this segment Brooks intends to provide an argument for slavery being less influential in American history than it actually was. The way Brooks tries to accomplish this goal is by portraying slavery as something unique to the American South and by downplaying the number of slaves in relation to the population. So with Brooks purposes in mind let’s begin the dissection of this bad history.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first method Brooks uses to downplay the role of slavery is portraying it as an institution unique to the American South and listing cities such as Washington D.C, New York, Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis as cities that weren’t built by slaves and therefore evidence of slavery’s lack of importance to the nation. The first issue with this is that slavery definitely did exist outside the American South and at the time of the first American census in 1790 the only states which had no slaves were Massachusetts which had abolished slavery in 1783, and Vermont which had abolished slavery in 1777. Of the 694,280 slaves in the country in 1790 roughly 24% (164,707) of them lived outside of the American South. \n\nAs for the building of the cities Brooks lists I think it’s worth going through a few of them to demonstrate how important slavery was to even Northern cities. In colonial New York, 1703 to be exact, roughly 41% of households in the city owned slaves.Many important structures in the early city, including the wall for which Wall Street is named, were built by slaves. In Washington D.C slavery was legal until 1862 and the city was the site of a prosperous slave market on the National Mall before it was abolished in 1850. Slaves were also part of the construction of some of the most important symbols in the capital such as the Capitol Building, the White House, and possibly the Washington Monument as well. In Boston Slaves were not particularly important, the highest percentage of slaves in Massachusetts was 2% in the 1750’s, however the money merchants made through the slave trade and slave labor was important to the city’s development with buildings such as Harvard Law School and Faneuil Hall being built with profits gained through slavery. In St. Louis there were 4,346 slaves by 1860 though that was only a small fraction of the city’s population of over 160,000 (though slaves made up about 10% of the entire state’s population). With these numbers in mind Slavery cannot be said to have directly contributed to St. Louis’ growth. Chicago had even less influence from slaves with the NorthWest territory having only between 1,000 and 2,000 slaves prior to slavery being abolished in the territory by 1787. So out of the five examples Brooks lists only two of them can be said to not have had slavery be a major part of their development.\n\nBrooks also defines the American South as “a far off, remote section of a nation” which is kind of confusing because he never really says what it’s relative too. My best guess is that he means relative to the rest of the United States but this statement doesn’t really make sense as the American south was not really remote in terms of geography since it was literally bordering the capital of the nation, in terms of economic impact as even Northern factories were being fueled with Southern cotton, or in terms of population as over a quarter of the nation’s population was living in the South in 1860.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe second method Brooks uses to downplay the role of slavery is by fudging numbers. Brooks says that there were only 300,000 slaves brought from Africa to the United States and that there is no way that 300,000 slaves could have a large impact on a nation whose population was over 30 million by the time slavery was abolished. This argument has several massive flaw chief amongst them being that comparing these numbers is irrelevant to the argument he is making.\n\nFirst let’s address 300,000 imported slaves. This number is close enough to being correct as there were roughly 388,000 slaves brought to the United States. These slaves were not brought over all at once however, they were imported to the country over the course of nearly 200 years between 1619 when the first slaves arrived in Virginia and 1807 when the importation of slaves was made illegal. The reason such a relatively small number of slaves have such a large impact on American history is because a key feature of American chattel slavery was the breeding of slaves. It was cheaper to breed slaves than to just buy new ones so slave owners would simply breed their slaves to obtain new slaves. This practice also allowed the system of American slavery to be maintained after the importation of slaves from abroad was made illegal in 1807. So knowing this, the number of slaves Brooks should be using should be 3,957,760 which was the number of slaves in the United states in 1860, the year of the last census before slavery was abolished. Using these more accurate figures slaves were not 1% of the population as Brooks would have his audience believe but rather were about 14% of the population by the time slavery was abolished.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd before closing this I feel it’s worthwhile to mention one other aspect of Brooks argument that I found a bit funny. At one point in the video Brooks mentions how “regressives” like to mention slavery’s horrors and couple them with black and white photos, saying that “they would have you believe American slavery ended only a few years ago, not 150”. Brooks accompanies this statement with black and white photo, presumably of slavery’s horrors, to use as an example. What’s funny about this however is that by using a reverse google image search it seems that the photo is from [a stock photo website](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/african-american-men-women-and-children-pick-cotton-in-a-news-photo/2605270#/african-american-men-women-and-children-pick-cotton-in-a-cotton-field-picture-id2605270) where the photo is said to be not of the horrors of slavery, but of sharecroppers in 1890. I just think it’s funny that Brooks couldn’t even manage to find an actual example of what is supposedly a go-to move of his ideological opponents.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo in conclusion Brooks is terribly incorrect when he says that “the amount of slaves and their impact is always overlown”. If anything his video proves just the opposite, that the role of slaves is often underplayed in American history and slaves outside of the American South aren’t properly acknowledged for their contributions to the development to the nation. I’m not sure if Brooks used incorrect numbers to intentionally fool his audience into believing something that’s untrue or if he simply was just too dumb to realize that almost none of what he was saying was accurate (I suspect it’s a mix of both), but regardless of his reasoning I have to say that this is just a very dishonest portrayal of history that simply doesn’t stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. I’d like to thank you all for reading this and I hope that you’ve all enjoyed it. I'd also like to remind everyone to be mindful of Rule 2 if you're going to comment and not discuss the Bill Nye sections of the video here.

        "title": "The Politically Incorrect Guide to History is Incorrect about Imperial German Atrocities",
        "author": "CosmicPaddlefish",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8xliq6/the_politically_incorrect_guide_to_history_is/",
        "text": "The Politically Incorrect Guide to History is a book by Tom Woods, a Libertarian/Paleoconservative author and the host of the podcast The Tom Woods Show. This book was, at one point, a New York Times Best Seller, and has been praised by politicians in the United States. I'm relatively new to Badhistory, and I have little formal training in history at all, but I think I can take a good shot at this one.\n\nThe book has been widely criticized for its portrayal of the American Civil War, Slavery, and Civil Rights. I may make entries about these another time. However, his whitewashing of Imperial German atrocities in World War One has escaped notice. I found his particularly unusual. Southern Strategy denial? Typical. Lost Cause nonsense? Common. But a libertarian Kaiserboo? This is something truly fascinating and bizarre.\n\nTom Woods has been described as both a paleoconservative and a libertarian. Both of these ideologies typically support non-interventionism. Woods wants his book to be a \"true\" guide to American History, not like the overly \"biased\" ones which support things that make his ideology look bad. Unfortunately, Woods tries to back up his non-interventionist stance by defending and downplaying the war crimes of far-right governments the U.S. fought against, such as the German Empire. I would like to emphasize that there are plenty of reasons to support non-interventionism which are backed up by solid historical evidence. Unfortunately, not a lot of that is provided in The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History.\n\nIn the start of his chapter on World War 1, he goes over how different scholars have argued over which country is the most to blame for the start of World War 1. He doesn't give a definitive answer to this, so there isn't much I can comment on.\n\n&gt;Germany’s violation of Belgian neutrality, which involved the passing of troops through Belgium on their way to France, became for the Allies a symbol of barbarity and militarism run amok and a reminder of the need to wipe autocracy from the face of the earth. Germany’s violation of Belgian neutrality was certainly an outrage, but obviously not the greatest atrocity in the history of mankind. \n\nThis may be pedantic, but the phrase \"obviously not the greatest atrocity in the history of mankind\" is obviously downplaying the atrocities committed by German forces in Belgium. You could say the same thing about the Rape of Nanking, My Lai Massacre, or any number of famous historical atrocities. Just because one is worse doesn't mean another isn't terrible.\n\n&gt; The Germans had made the same request of the Belgians that they had of Luxembourg, which accepted them without difficulty: they wanted safe passage for German  troops, and agreed to compensate Belgians for any damage or for any victuals consumed along the way.\n\nPerhaps if the Kaiser called up Dr. Frankenstein, he could compensate the numerous people killed by German soldiers in Belgium. However, the occupation of Belgium and Luxembourg were much different.\n\nAccording to 1914-1918-Online, there was no \"German take-over of administration\": \n\n&gt;Unlike the World War Two experience, the German occupation of Luxembourg during World War One did not include a German take-over of administration. The German authorities did not interfere directly in the internal affairs of the country, nor did they interfere with the functioning of the institutions or the use of languages: French retained its traditional preeminence. The constitutional and administrative organisation of Luxembourg remained intact. The German presence remained fairly light, and included about 5,000 German soldiers who were stationed permanently in Luxembourg. During the first weeks of the war, successive German armies passing through the country negotiated with the political and economic elite in Luxembourg. The lack of permanent contact persons posed repeated problems for the Luxembourgish authorities. Only five months after the invasion, in January 1915, a more stable structure (*Militärverwaltung*) was implemented under the direction of [Richard Karl von Tessmar (1853-1928)](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/index/names/1048553647), which remained intact until the withdrawal of German troops in 1918.\n\nThe occupation of Belgium, however, was much different, and Germany intended on making it a vassal state. According to 1914-1918-Online, the occupation of Belgium included economic exploitation and a change in administration:\n\n&gt;After the German Army had occupied wide areas of Belgium, the \"Imperial Government General in Belgium\" was established on 23 August 1914 with a governor-general at its head. Organized into a military administration (the \"Government General\") and a civil administration (Zivilverwaltung) the land was administered and exploited in favor of the German war effort until November 1918.\n\nAs we can see, these two situations are not comparable, and do not downplay or mitigate the atrocities committed by the German Empire. The invasion of Belgium also broke the 1839 Treaty of London, which established Belgium as neutral and was signed by Prussia.\n\nNext, Tom Woods goes on the typical apologist route, which is about how it's all secretly propaganda:\n\n&gt;Allied governments won an important public relations victory in America with propaganda alleging widespread atrocities committed by German soldiers against Belgian civilians. Children with their hands cut off, babies tossed from bayonet to bayonet, nuns violated, corpses made into margarine—these were just some of the gruesome tales coming out of wartorn Europe.  Americans on the scene, however, could not verify these stories. American reporters who had followed the German army insisted that they had seen nothing at all that would lend credence to the lurid tales making their way to the United States. Clarence Darrow, the lawyer who would become known for his work in the Scopes trial of 1925, offered to pay $1,000 (roughly $17,000 in 2004 dollars) to anyone who could show him a Belgian boy whose hands had been cut off by a German soldier. No one took him up on it. (After the war it was well established that the Belgian atrocities were largely fabricated, but the lies did their damage.)  \n\nThis section, honestly, made my blood boil when I read it for the first time. Many atrocities in Belgium were exaggerated, but they *still happened,* and they are still noteworthy. According to The Great War Project, atrocities included massacring children and shooting priests:\n\n&gt; The Germans respond viciously. “Almost from the first hours,” writes war historian John Keegan, “innocent civilians were shot and villages burnt, outrages all hotly denied by the Germans as soon as the news – subsequently well attested – reached neutral newspapers. Priests were shot too.”... “The killing was systematic,” writes Keegan. At one small Belgian town – Tamines – 384 were killed according to Keegan.  “The hostages were massed in the square, shot down by execution squads and survivors bayoneted.” \n\nOxford University gives more details in their educational materials:\n\n&gt;Alan Kramer and John Horne, in their magisterial volume on this subject (*German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial*; 2001), have painstakingly reconstructed the reality behind the propaganda in a way that should leave no reader in doubt.  Through years of careful archival research they have reached the conclusion that there was indeed a systematic program of civilian executions — sometimes en masse — conducted in Belgium, by the German army, with the purpose of breaking the spirit of resistance and striking terror into the heart of the population.  The anniversaries of the worst of these catastrophes are upon us; on August 23rd, 1914 — ninety-nine years ago tomorrow — the German army took revenge upon the Belgian city of Dinant for what it falsely believed to be the actions of Belgian *francs-tireurs* (“free-shooters”, or non-military partisans).  This revenge took the form of the burning of over a 1,000 buildings and the execution of some 674 civilians.  The oldest among them was in his 90s; the youngest was barely a month old.  These civilians were killed in a variety of ways.  Some were bayoneted, others burned alive; most were bound, put up against walls, and then executed by a volley of rifle fire — all in reprisal for something that *had not actually happened*.  Two days later (August 25th), the same spirit of reprisal played out again elsewhere — [in Leuven](http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/louvain.htm). \n\nThe same article from Oxford University's World War I Centenary also breaks down the atrocities by sheer numbers:\n\n&gt;The total Belgian deaths during the war amount to 100,000- 40,000 military deaths and 60,000 civilian deaths.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of those civlians who died as a direct result of the war, some **6,000 were executed**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nearly 1.5 million Belgians were displaced by the German occupation of their land, with impoverished refugees fleeing in every direction. Some 200,000 ended up in Britain, and another 300,000 in France.  The most, by far — nearly a million — fled to the Netherlands, but did not always have an easy time in doing so.  The German army constructed a **200km-long electrified fence, called the** ***Dodendraad*** **by the Dutch, that claimed the lives of around 3,000 attempted escapees during the course of the war.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some **120,000 Belgian civilians (of both sexes) were used as forced labour** during the war, with roughly half being **deported to Germany to toil in prison factories and camps**, and half being sent to work just behind the front lines.  Anguished Belgian letters and diaries from the period tell of being forced to work for the *Zivilarbeiter-Bataillone*, repairing damaged infrastructure, laying railway tracks, even manufacturing weapons and other war materiel for their enemies.  Some were even forced to work in the support lines at the Front itself, digging secondary and tertiary trenches as Allied artillery fire exploded around them.\n\nThe way Woods hand-waves the atrocities, by debunking one specific part of it, is also absurd. It would be like saying that the 1914 Christmas Truce didn't happen or is completely irrelevant because there is little evidence a game of football was played on a battlefield.\n\nThere's another particularly egregious part in his WWI section, which is largely dedicated to arguing that American interests were not threatened in WWI. A simple \"search word\" section of my internet browser points out the word \"Zimmermann\" appears precisely zero times. The Zimmerman Telegram was an encoded message sent from the German Foreign Minister to the General Minister to Mexico. It offered to give Mexico U.S. territories and military support if Mexico allied with Germany. It was a major reason the United States entered World War One, but in his section criticizing the U.S. for entering WWI, he completely omits it. \n\nI found this omission particularly egregious. Even if everything you know about WWI comes from Scott Westerfield's *Leviathan* series, you know what the Zimmermann Telegram is. It shows just how honest Tom Woods is in his history writing. For all of his railings against liberals, interventionists, or anyone else he disagrees with tampling with history to fit an agenda, he is willing to make the most absurd distortions, whitewashing, and outright omission of important information when his own cause is on the line. It is not necessary to distort history like this to argue that the U.S. shouldn't have entered WWI.\n\nFinally, in the midst of all of this, he doesn't capitalize \"Kaiser.\"\n\nI may revisit other parts of this book later and make more r/badhistory posts. Again, I'm new to this, so my first post might not be perfect.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Book I accidentally downloaded: file:///C:/Users/anima/Downloads/The&amp;#37;20Politically&amp;#37;20Incorrect&amp;#37;20Guid&amp;#37;20-&amp;#37;20Woods,&amp;#37;20Thomas&amp;#37;20E.,&amp;#37;20Jr.\\_4954&amp;#37;20(1).pdf\n\n\"The 'Rape of Belgium' Revisited\", World War I Centenary: [http://ww1centenary.oucs.ox.ac.uk/memoryofwar/the-rape-of-belgium-revisited/](http://ww1centenary.oucs.ox.ac.uk/memoryofwar/the-rape-of-belgium-revisited/)\n\n\"The Rape of Belgium\", The Great War Project, Mike Shuster: [http://greatwarproject.org/2014/08/06/the-rape-of-belgium/](http://greatwarproject.org/2014/08/06/the-rape-of-belgium/)\n\n\"Luxembourg\", 1914-1918-Online, Benoit Majerus and Charles Roemer: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/luxembourg](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/luxembourg)\n\n\"Occupation during the War (Belgium and France)\", 1914-1918-Online, Larissa Wegner: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/occupation\\_during\\_the\\_war\\_belgium\\_and\\_france](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/occupation_during_the_war_belgium_and_france)\n\n\"Generalgourvernement Belgien\", 1914-1918-Online, Christoph Roolf: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/generalgouvernement\\_belgien](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/generalgouvernement_belgien)\n\n\"The Zimmermann Telegram\", National Archives: [https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/zimmermann](https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/zimmermann)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8wplv1/the_molotovribbentrop_pact_was_a_simple/",
        "text": "This claim is a seemingly popular one of this website. Certainly one shared by [this user](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8wjz6e/things_that_happen_in_silicon_valley_and_also_the/e1wr9h3/).\n\n&gt;TIL signing a non-aggression pact to buy time to build up the military is literally the same as cooperating with Hitler\n\n However, it is not entirely consistent with reality. The Pact allowed for much greater cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Germans, far beyond simply not attacking the other.\n\nFor one, the two nations agreed to partition Eastern Europe among themselves, with the Germans taking just under half of Poland, and the Soviets taking the slight majority plus the Baltic States, Moldova, and regions of Finland. Some have defended these actions by claiming it was necessary to prevent the Nazis from taking it. But that would ask the question as to why the Soviets not only retained these territories after the war was over, but also had it ethnically cleansed of Poles. It also fails to explain the harshness of Soviet treatment toward the Poles and Balts, including the infamous Katyn massacre. It is rather odd that you would protect a people by shooting them into a ditch or driving them off their ancestral homelands.\n\nI have once seen a comparison made to the British invasion of Iceland. But this equivalence is quite false in that the British did not execute Icelandic officers en masse, and they withdrew from Iceland when the Nazi threat was dealt with as opposed to annexing the territory and having it cleansed of ethnic Icelanders.\n\nThe Soviets also granted Material and propaganda support to the Germans. According to American historian Otto Friedrich, shortly after Hitler's invasion of Poland, Stalin ordered the Comintern to cease anti-Fascist propaganda, and instead blame the English and French for the war. For this reason the exiled head of the Communist Party of Germany, Walter Ulbricht, would print in the [February 1940 issue](https://www.marxists.org/archive/ulbricht/1940/die-welt.htm) of his newspaper *Die Welt* that\n\n&gt;The German government declared itself ready to establish peaceful relations with the Soviet Union, whilst the Anglo-French war bloc want war against the Soviet Union. The people of the Soviet Union and the people of Germany desire a speedy end to the war in accordance with the interests of the working masses. The Soviet people and the workers of Germany are against the spread of the war.\n\nThe Soviets also instructed Communists in occupied nations not to resist. For this reason Communist anti-Fascist resistance would be quite limited until Operation Barbarossa.\n\nAccording to American Journalist William Shirer in *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich*, Material support was also granted to the Germans in the form of wheat, petroleum, cotton, and various other rare materials to help them beat the British blockade. In exchange the Soviets were given some manufactured goods from the Germans. The Soviets also granted Germany a submarine base in the arctic.\n\nIn summary the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did the following things in addition to being a Non-Aggression Pact:\n\n-Partitioned Eastern Europe into Spheres of Influence between the USSR and Germany, allowing the Soviets to annex territory that they would retain long after the war\n\n-Granted Germany access to Soviet resources, and in exchange gave the Soviets certain manufactured goods\n\n-Granted Germany a Submarine Base\n\n-Granted Germany propaganda support in the West\n\n-Discouraged anti-Fascist resistance among Communists in occupied Europe",

        "text": "Happy July 4th. Now let's purge this video :p\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsd05kjnayM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsd05kjnayM)\n\n&gt;0:04, it was an empire on a scale that has never been equaled.\n\nTerritory wise, the Chinese empires were not among the largest of the world. Qing empire was probably the largest empire that proclaim itself Chinese. The Yuan dynasty was limited due to the actual control of Yuan and not the entirety of the Mongol Empire. So I don't know what they are talking about.\n\nBureaucracy wise though, China was a pretty impressive government after the Qin Empire.\n\n&gt;0:08 Mysterious, violent in the extreme, and endlessly inventive.\n\nI felt like the writer of the show just picked a bunch of stereotype of China and ran with it.\n\nFirst mysterious. Japan was mysterious to the Europeans, Britian was mysterious to the Romans, China was KNOWN to basically everyone who was educated thanks to the silk road. There is nothing mysterious about a country that you been trading with since the Romans were still kicking Parthians around.\n\nThen violent in the extreme. The rate of war in which China engages is relatively peaceful. For example, if we look at the actual amount of wars China fought against settled states, such as Korea, Vietnam, etc, then we compare it with say, France and England, we would not call China violent in the extreme. Now that doesn't mean China doesn't go around invading people, but these are generally more reserved, more limited than other states due to their national ethos and philosophy were they oppose unjust wars.\n\nAnd inventive is probably the only thing I would agree here, but we need to be careful on what kind of 'inventive' we are talking about. Han dynasty was exceptional in their invention in better the livelihood of the people, for example, soil differentiation and seed treatments and precision seedings, etc.\n\n&gt;0:12 Only one empire has survived for 4,000 years, China.\n\nSo the issue here is if we count the actual Empire, as in, the Qin Empire in 221 B.C, and the imperial governance lasted till 1911, making the Empire 2132 yrs long in **IMPERIAL ADMINISTRATION** with multiple periods of minor feudal periods. Pre Qin, there were no empire, no central administration, it was feudalism.\n\nIt would be better to say it is a civilization that survived for more than 4,000 years than an empire that survived for 4,000 years.\n\n&gt;0:19 All powerful emperors mobilize immense peasant armies for feats of engineering unparalleled in human history.\n\nEmperors were not always all powerful. The imperial administration on division of powers on imperial governance has been pretty clear throughout the centuries. The Emperor stays in the capital, the governors govern the province, and the Confucian bureaucrats govern the state. The Song dynasty has exceptional powerful ministers, as did the Ming. Tang has exceptional powerful governors.\n\nThen China don't actually have 'peasant armies' until the Communist Party. The Chinese army were militia that were drilled in off season, and raised when necessary, in general, from Han dynasty on wards. Song dynasty kept standing armies, these soldiers in principle do not participate in other crafts or trade. As did the Ming, and Qing.\n\nEven rebellions were often not peasants. You can probably count the number of peasant rebellions, but you would lose your fingers and toes if you count the actual number of rebellions in China.\n\nAs for feats of engineering. Chinese taxes are base on two things, monetary taxes or in kind, and service or in kind. So do emperors and governors mobilize peasants to do construction on behalf of the government? Yes. Are they in the military? No.\n\n&gt;0:53, and yet dynasty after dynasty, consumed by vanity and greed would be toppled from power when the people rose up and oppression turn to destruction.\n\nLet's actually count how each dynasty fall.\n\nQin dynasty fall to Xiang Yu, a noble of the Chu kingdom who wishes to restore the old privilege of the nobles, rather than governance base on provinces.\n\nWestern Han fall to the usurper Wang Mang, an imperial relative by marriage. The Xin dynasty fall to Liu Xiu, the Guangwu emepror, descended from the Liu imperial family.\n\nThe Eastern Han fall to Cao Pi, he himself was son to the powerful warlord Cao Cao, whose family was well connected and powerful and rich. His cousin was married to the family of Empress Wang, his adopted grandfather was the powerful eunuch who reach the rank of Dachangqiu Cao Gao, his father was the Grand Commander Cao Song (who, of course, purchase the highest military office with 1,000,000,000,000 cash (around that period give or take, a 2 horse carriage cost 10,000 cash) so let's just say, they aren't a peasant family rebelling against the state either.\n\nThe Wei dynasty was usurped by the Sima clan, who were powerful family since the time of Han.\n\nThe Western Jin dynasty was destroyed because barbarians. The barbarians was employed by the emperor to guard the frontier, which worked, until they decided they no longer want to guard the frontier.\n\nThe Eastern Jin dynasty was destroyed by Liu Yu. Now, Liu Yu was from a poor family, but he served in the military and reached high post. One would not define his usurpation as a peasant rebellion, but rather, a powerful military man taking over a ineffective court.\n\nThe Norther and Southern Dynasties were all usurped by relatives, generals, and ministers. None of which was toppled by peasant rebellions.\n\nThe Sui dynasty unified everyone, and while they were one of the three most impacted by peasant rebellion, the peasant rebellion was already crushed pretty much at that point. The Sui was ended by Li Yuan, a relative who usurped the throne, and Wang Shichong, another who usurped the throne. The two child emperors been grandson to Yang Guang.\n\nThe Tang dynasty ended because the governors became too powerful and took over. Which we enter another period of Northern and Southern divsion.\n\nThe Song dynasty ended all that, alone with the Liao Dynasty.\n\nLiao was destroyed by the Jin dynasty, the Song was destroyed by the Mongol.\n\nThe Yuan dynasty was the only one that was destroyed by a peasant rebellion, the Red Turban rebellion. Which led to the formation of Ming dynasty.\n\nMing dynasty was affected by Li Zicheng's peasant rebellion, but Ming was actually destroyed by the Qing dynasty.\n\nAnd Qing dynasty was toppled by the Wuchang uprising, and the New Army.\n\nSo there we go, of all the dynasties in China, only 1 was actually toppled by peasants. (No modern History was involved in this post.) Honorable mention goes to Huang Que's rebellion, the Taiping Rebellion, and the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which all were crushed.\n\nAnd we are only 1 min in.\n\n&gt;2:04 but for centuries, China was in turmoil, separate kingdoms battled for power and control.... the period was call the warring states.\n\nChina was a feudal kingdom under Zhou. Which means these are duchies and counties, not separate kingdoms. And while they may eventual proclaim their leader as king, the titular ruler was still the Zhou King, who reign until QSHD kick him out.\n\n&gt;2:54, their unification of this vast land would create an empire like no other the world has ever seen.\n\nHello, Alexander phoned.\n\nOK break time to shoot some fireworks.

        "author": "wastheword",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8v5wau/descending_into_jordan_petersons_peerreviewed/",
        "text": "On my [last episode of charting Jordan Peterson’s abuses of history](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8lybor/jordan_peterson_butchers_french_intellectual/), we considered postwar French intellectuals (here’s my longer, [more polished take](https://medium.com/s/story/peterson-historian-aide-m%C3%A9moire-9aa3b6b3de04)). This time, we’ll be expanding to the nebulous but grandiose entity called “the West” or “Western Civilization,” which Peterson maintains is founded upon a “sovereignty of the individual” concept stretching back to antiquity and beyond. We’re upping the difficulty level immensely, because the main object of ridicule is his “scholarly” *published and peer reviewed* paper[ “Religion, Sovereignty, Natural Rights, and the Constituent Elements of Experience”](https://www.scribd.com/document/99950218/48-2006-Peterson-JB-the-Constituent-Elements-of-Experience-Arch-Psychol-Religion) (2006, *Archive for the Psychology of Religion*, 5 citations). If you’re looking for a historical debunking as concrete as atheist Nazis, skip this longass post since it will be a study in bad intellectual history rather than more material histories. That said, if scholarly journals demand the highest standards of work, then this is deeply embarrassing for both Peterson and the journal, because he invested countless hours in this presentist pillaging and anachronistic orgy rather than merely dropping some casual badhistory into a video or interview. We’re looking at the intersection of badhistory, badphilosophy, badsocialscience, and badtheology, so there will be more muckracking on methodology than flogging on facts. Indeed he sometimes ventures into “not even wrong” territory because certain obfuscated statements and their negations seem equally plausible.\n\n**Introduction and Critique of Methods**\n\nThe central idea here, relentlessly mentioned in his videos and interviews, is that “the bedrock idea upon which Western Civilization is predicated ... is the sovereignty of the individual\" (he has also referred to the “paramount divinity of the individual”). This form of sovereignty typically refers to the self-ownership, rights, and dignity of individuals, usually in distinction to that of society (J.S. Mill asks: “What then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual over himself? Where does the authority of society begin? How much of human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society?”). That said, Peterson will continuously conflate “rights” sovereignty with “kingship” sovereignty—all while failing to define the term (thus “sovereignty” might simply mean importance). Indeed all of the most important terms in his argument remained undefined (except for *logos*, which he redefines to suit his purposes). Peterson’s main venture in this paper is to ground the sovereignty of the individual not in Locke, the Enlightenment, or the more recent libertarian and anarchist usages, but in ancient religious practice from an ill-defined group of primordial sources.\n\nI will explain why, *even* *if* we uncritically accept the dubious concept of *the* West (and we shouldn’t), and *even* *if* it had a stable set of values (and it doesn’t)—then Peterson-as-historian is *still* full of shit. The sovereign individual—which is a *modern* term infused with all sorts of political, psychological, and philosophical meanings—is certainly an important and valuable concept with historical precedents all over the place. But it is neither particular to the West (whatever this is), nor the “bedrock” of Western civilization. While we might *associate* the West with individualism like the anthropologist Louis Dumont (in his view the West: India :: individualism : holism), to speak of “predication” or an essence is a huge claim. Peterson imposes a ridiculous narrative over millennia that culminates in the modern primacy of the sovereign individual, crafting a teleological view of history that pretends ancient societies directed themselves towards something of which they could not conceive. His obsession with the individual—“The individual, that’s the secret to the world”—leads him into a Whiggish wonderland where history progresses towards his pet concepts. If you impose an[ individualist/collectivist template](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b63f/304325495c4603fe5b6acaca25c442e610a1.pdf) on ancient societies you can easily get muddy results (both/neither). And in the case of the Greco-Roman world, the muddy answer would probably lean towards collectivism, which is terrible news for JBP’s argument since this is the most vital historical terrain of the “West.” Without getting into contemporary politics or Ayn Rand, let’s just say that dogmatically worshiping individualism (Peterson speaks of its divinity) adds a certain tendentiousness to any inquiry as to its origins.\n\nThere’s some fascinating and challenging work that has been done, and still needs to be done, on the ancient precedents of individual rights and the senses of citizenship/personhood/selfhood/autonomy (in addition to primitive communism, tribalism, and collective religious practices). But you won’t gain it from Peterson. Aside from mystifying countless factual details into unfalsifiable jargon, Peterson’s greatest weakness as a historian is that he is completely ignorant of philology—the historical/comparative study of languages—leading him to believe that things like “the individual” or “sovereignty” are transhistorical concepts (instead of being embedded in specific contexts and expressed in their languages). Perhaps part of his argument could be repaired if he deliberately studied ancient societies like a classicist, but that would require dropping his evolutionary shtick.\n\nPeterson takes a great deal from the historian of religion Mircea Eliade, and his fetish words can be found in Eliade’s section titles ([“Sacrality of the Mesopotamian sovereign”, “Conquering the dragon”)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=RKjbAgAAQBAJ). Peterson’s also takes Eliade’s worst tendencies—huge generalizations, no method, too many cross-cultural continuities—and amplifies them tenfold yet fails to absorb his historical erudition. Note how Eliade stylistically and substantively anticipates Peterson:  “at the archaic levels of culture, the real – that is to say the powerful, the significant, the living – is equivalent to the sacred.” Though Eliade is a handy one-stop-shop of ancient religion, he’s completely inadequate on his own. Pulling off an argument with Peterson’s grandiose scope would at the very least require some hardcore anthropology (which, following Marcel Mauss, has worked on questions of ancient personhood/individualism). Peterson’s bibliography is incredibly light on anthropology, classics, political science, and history—the key domains of his argument—but incorporates plenty of psychologists and tangential but famous thinkers and writers such as Nietzsche, Frye, Shakespeare, and Dostoevsky. If you read the article's abstract in conjunction with the bibliography, you get a foreboding sense of the impossibility of arguing the former via the latter.\n\nWe can cut Peterson some slack because he’s writing in a psychology of religion journal, but only up to a point—his presentism is too extreme.  By presentism, I mean imposing modern concepts and values on ancient societies who had no fucking clue what these things mean, and who used wildly different linguistic and conceptual frameworks than our own. For instance, it is dangerous to speak of “ancient Greek science” because they only knew of *physis* (nature) and “natural philosophy,” while lacking both the word and strict concept of science (Peterson himself states: “Science emerged a mere four hundred years ago”). Likewise, the terms “Western values”, “Western civilization”, and “Western man” emerge in the 20th century, with precedents in the late 19th. We should understand that classical Greece, despite being a vital origin for things we associate with Western civilization, did not envision itself having “Western values”: they primarily had a concept of virtue (*arete*), and these virtues, of course, could not be conceptualized through “the West.”\n\nThe distinction of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires is ancient, but does not simply map onto the modern “West.” Some important and often-conflated senses of “the West” include 1) a geographic area, often defined in opposition to “the Orient” (and then later, to the USSR) and  2) a certain set of inheritances from ancient Greece, Rome, Christianity, and Judaism, plus adjacent influences including but not limited to Egypt and Mesopotamia (which Peterson cites). Today we tendentiously select a mixture of inheritances for our political purposes, all too happy to celebrate the (partial) Athenian democracy while doubting, for instance, the aristocratic and unchristian ideal of *kalokagathia* (which links bodily beauty to moral conduct) and vehemently rejecting the treasured practice of established men putting their penises between the thighs of the most delectable boys in exchange for moral and political education (pederasty). The source societies for “Western values” curiously teem with disturbingly alien practices. And yet, it makes vastly more sense to say that an ancient society was predicated on one of own its concepts like *kalokagathia* than something formulated two millennia later. It would much more sensible (but still hugely troubling) to say Western civilization is “founded” on *politeia* or *civitas*—very roughly: citizenship—which involves an individual-collective relation.\n\n**The Argument**\n\nLet us consider the brave, swashbuckling argument of the Greatest Public Intellectual in the West^(TM). By taking a \"much broader evolutionary/historical perspective with regards to the development of human individuality\", Peterson seeks to \"groun\\[d\\] the concept of sovereignty and natural right back into the increasingly implicit and profoundly religious soil from which it originally emerged.” Otherwise, Peterson claims, the “most cherished presumptions of the West remain castles in the air.” Whereas a normal scholar might discern a connection between individualism and ancient religion and seek to describe it, Peterson is about to wantonly pillage a few ancient texts for confirming evidence while failing to even superficially describe how individualism, sovereignty, or rights actually functioned among the various societies he so eagerly jumps between.\n\nAfter trudging through some mystical woo and superficial phenomenology, and witnessing Peterson cite his previous work to substantiate the venerable Dragon of Chaos, we arrive at this cultural charcuterie board:\n\n&gt;The king's sovereignty was predicated on his assumption of the role of [Marduk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk). That sovereignty was not arbitrary: it remained valid only insofar as the king was constantly and genuinely engaged, as a representative or servant of Marduk, in the creative struggle with chaos. … Sovereignty itself was therefore grounded in *Logos*, as much for the Mesopotamians as for the modern Christian—and equally as much for the ancient Egyptian and Jew (as we shall see). This notion of sovereignty, of right, is not a mere ﬁgment of opinion, arbitrarily grounded in acquired rationality, but a deep existential observation, whose truth was revealed after centuries of collaborative ritual endeavor and contemplation. Existence and life abundant is predicated on the proper response of exploratory and communicative consciousness to the fact of the unlimited unknown.\n\nHere's a spicy bowl of anachronism soup. The term *sovereign* is not from antiquity, but from old French (he never defines it, but via the appositive he seems to mean the possession of rights). He conflates this sort of sovereignty with actual kingship. Furthermore, the Mesopotamians didn't know what the fuck the Greek or Christian *logos* was. *Logos* is indeed a semantic landmine. Peterson’s definition of *logos* is “everything our modern word *consciousness* means and more. It means mind, and the creative actions of mind: exploration, discovery, reconceptualization, reason.” And yet, this is neither the same sense as John 1:1 nor that of Plato, Aristotle, or the sophists (why choose logos over the Greek alternatives here: *psyche* or *nous*?). To whom was this \"truth\" revealed “after centuries of collaborative ritual endeavor”? Which societies? The final sentence has virtually zero semantic content. How the fuck is existence *predicated* on a response?\n\nThe key phrase in this paragraph is “sovereignty was therefore grounded in *Logos*.” If you read it as “rights \\[sovereignty\\] were grounded in reason \\[Logos\\]” it sort of makes sense, but rationalized rights is explicitly what he’s rejecting in this paper. The *logos*\\-individual connection has merits in the case of Christianity, I think, but statements like this need a ton of evidence: “The individual logos therefore partakes of the essence of the deity. This implies that there is something genuinely divine about the individual.” The Christ*ian l*ogos (John 1:1) must stay within the Christian world, and cannot anachronistically bulldoze over all the meanings accrued from classical Greece. It’s charlatanism to insert it back into Mesopotamia. If ancient Semitic languages have a truly equivalent word with all the meanings Peterson ascribes to \\*logos, I’ll eat a printout of this article cooked in lobster sauce.\n\nContinuing on, we find Peterson advancing  a “trickle-down sovereignty” that magically spreads out:\n\n&gt;By the end of the Egyptian dynasties, the aristocrats themselves were characterized by identity with the immortal union of Horus and Osiris. Sovereignty had started to spread itself out, down the great pyramid of society. By the time of the Greeks, sovereignty was an attribute intrinsically characteristic of every male citizen. Barbarians were excluded. Women were excluded. Slaves were excluded. Nonetheless, the idea of universal sovereignty was coming to the forefront, and could not long be resisted.\n\nGreek citizenship or *politeia* has fuck all to do with \"sovereignty\" in the wackass mystical sense he wants to use it. What we would call citizens, *politēs*, were sure as shit not sovereigns or \"individuals\" in the modern sense from political science. The male head of the household (*kyrios*) had “rights”, but then again, ancient Greek has no exact equivalent for “rights” (though there are related legal concepts like *dike,* a claim). I'm assuming he means classical Greece, but he never specifies. In which societies was \"universal sovereignty\" coming to the forefront, and it is fair to even call them universals? How the fuck can an entity be “coming to the forefront” among ancient peoples who lacked the very words and concepts required to grasp it?\n\nThe most scholarly way of refuting or repairing Peterson’s argument would be analyzing [ancient legal codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_legal_codes) with philological rigor. For instance, ancient Egypt basically had one fuzzy word (*hp*) for “every kind of rule, either natural or juridical, general or specific, public or private, written or unwritten. That is, in an administrative or legal context, every source of rights, such as ‘law,’ ‘decree,’ ‘custom,’ and even ‘contract.’” (Oxford Enc. of Ancient Egypt). On the other hand, Peterson, drawing on Eliade, often talks about sovereignty as kingship. This is a different beast. For instance, for Homeric Greece and other Indo-European societies, we find according to the great philologist Émile Benveniste “the idea of the king as the author and guarantor of the prosperity of his people, if he follows the rules of justice and divine commandments (in the *Odyssey*: “a good king (*basileús*) \\[is he\\] who respects the gods, who lives according to justice, who reigns (*anássōn*) over numerous and valiant men” (19, 110ff)). It is completely fucking impossible to draw a straight line from kingship to citizens’ rights and skip the intermediate steps.\n\nAll of a sudden, Peterson leaps away from Greece to a radically different situation that has nothing to do with *politeia*:\n\n&gt;The ancient Jews, likewise, began to develop ideas that, if not derived directly from Egypt, were at least heavily influenced by Egypt. Perhaps that is the basis for the idea of the Exodus, since evidence for its historical reality is slim. The Jews begin to say, and not just to act out, this single great idea: \"not the aristocracy, not the pharaoh, but every (Jewish) individual has the capacity of establishing a direct relationship with the Transcendent, with the Unnameable and Unrepresentable Totality.\" The Christian revolution followed closely on that, pushing forth the entirely irrational but irresistibly powerful idea that sovereignty inheres in everyone, no matter how unlikely: male, female, barbarian, thief, murderer, rapist, prostitute and taxman. It is in such well-turned and carefully prepared ancient soil that our whole democratic culture is rooted.\n\nAgain, Peterson shifts “sovereignty” to mean an entirely different thing: not *politeia* but an individual relation to God. How “our whole democratic culture” (presumably associated with Athens circa the 5th century BCE) could be “rooted” in the subsequent “Christian revolution” is not clear. Of course, it could be argued that the Christianised soul (*psyche*) helped foster individual dignity which enhanced later versions of democracy, but Peterson doesn’t argue anything nearly so restrained. Speaking of “*our* whole democratic culture” certainly conceals some great discontinuities.\n\nPeterson’s hardcore presentism and historical naivete betrays itself whenever he talks about societal progress. Despite the bookshelves dedicated to figuring out the philosophical motors of history, the reasons for the rise and fall of societies, and related historiographic questions, he finishes off his paper some “great man theory” drivel and circular reasoning. If Peterson sent me his paper for peer feedback, here’s what I tell him:\n\n&gt;Societies move forward because individuals bring them forward. \\[this is either tautologically true or a dubious “great man” move\\]. Since the environment moves forward, of its own accord, a society without individual voice stagnates, and petriﬁes, and will eventually collapse. \\[this is a big claim and it needs some examples\\] If the individual is refused a voice, then society no longer moves. \\[“moves” in what sense? What does progress mean to you?\\] This is particularly true if that individual has been rejected or does not ﬁt—because the voice of the well-adjusted has already been heard. … The historical evidence \\[that isn’t provided\\] suggests that certain value structures are real. \\[where do they exist?\\] They are emergent properties of individual motivation and motivated social behavior. As emergent properties, moral structures are real. \\[in what sense? In nature or custom?\\] It is on real \\[using this word again doesn’t help\\] ground, deeply historical \\[read a book or two\\], emergent—even evolutionarily-determined—that our world rests, not on the comparatively shallow ground of rationality (as established in Europe, a mere 400 years ago) \\[what was the classical Greek logos all about then?\\]. What we have in our culture is much more profound and solid and deep \\[\\*takes vape hit\\*\\] than any mere rational construction. We have a form of government, an *equilibrated state*, which is an emergent consequence of an ancient process. … Our political presuppositions—our notion of \"natural rights\"—rest on a cultural foundation that is unbelievably archaic. \\[BUT WHAT IS IT?\\]\n\nPeterson’s final answer to where “natural rights” exist eludes me, but I think he means in the fabled dominance hierarchy (“Even the chimpanzee and the wolf, driven by their biology and culture, act out the idea that sovereignty inheres in the individual”). Surely talking about mammal “sovereignty” is quite figurative—this notion should have been its own paper, perhaps, because we’re no longer talking about culture as commonly understood. And if we’re talking about universals among different species, then the “Western values” framing must necessarily evaporate. Peterson’s final sentence declares “Natural rights truly exist, and they come with natural responsibilities. Some truths are indeed self-evident.” I’m glad this was self evident to Peterson, because all I saw was him trying and failing to anchor these rights in a series of badhistories concerning societies that conceptualized rights and individualism in a radically different way than we do today, if they did at all.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis little-discussed and barely cited academic paper is an underappreciated pillar of Peterson’s thought: his *most rigorous* attempt at anchoring the individual. Let's here him out, one more time, in case he starts making sense. He recently[ rehashed his argument](https://jordanbpeterson.com/transcripts/death-and-resurrection/):\n\n&gt;In the beginning, only the king was sovereign. Then the nobles became sovereign. Then, with the Greeks, all men became sovereign. Then came the Christian revolution, and every individual…became, so impossibly, equally sovereign. Then our cultural and legal systems … \\[made\\] individual sovereignty … their central, unshakeable pillar … \\[because in effect\\] every singular one of us is a divine center of *Logos*.\n\nGot it?

Payments on Patreon start at only $5 per month!\n\nI would like to apologize for not being able to give you a concise and accurate account of individualism, personhood, and all the adjacent concepts: it’s too hard, I don’t know enough, and perhaps it’s impossible. Charles Taylor’s *Sources of the Self*, for instance, is 600+ pages and doesn’t even tackle non-Greek ancient societies. Though I’m not an anthropologist, I think anthropology has much to say on this topic, so I will leave you with one thought. According to Louis Dumont, the holistic relations of the Greco-Roman world gave way to a nascent, more individualistic Christianity: what was “given from the start in Christianity is the brotherhood of love in and through Christ, and the consequent equality of all.” This partly confirms the Christian part of Peterson’s argument, but goes against all of the more ancient societies he considers. On a vaguely related but fascinating note, Dumont makes the stunning claim that Marx was essentially an individualist. If this is true in any way, it suggests reconsidering the individual/collective dichotomy that we so readily take for granted.\n\n**Parting Remarks**\n\nPeterson, even at his most rigorous, is not rigorous at all. His quantitative psychology papers might be good, but this here is simply bad scholarship. Some parts of this argument could be salvaged with great effort (the rise of individualism via Christianity), but he espouses so much r/badhistory and r/badphilosophy that he should start from scratch.\n\nI wouldn't say “Religion, Sovereignty, Natural Rights, and the Constituent Elements of Experience” is in the worst 1&amp;#37; of the countless social science and humanities articles that I read -- merely the worst 5&amp;#37;. Ultimately, I am struck by its arrogance and uselessness. If it had focused on one society or period, other scholars could use its details and references. Instead, it tries way, way too hard to be deep (Peterson loves the word \"deep\"). The point of this paper was to take individual sovereignty into a level \"deeper than rationality\" -- into religious experience.  Peterson indeed goes deep -- deep into muddy arguments, murky obscurities, and maddening amounts of bullshit.\n\n**Recommended Reading:**\n\n*The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History*.

        "text": "**The video**\n\nThe video which contains badhistory and I will be focusing on is [Ahoy's video about the American handgun Colt M1911.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hsGZSVG4E&amp;) While a good video, it appears to have misconstrued USA's diplomatic history, and the statement may lead some to believe America didn't do shit prior to WW1. The badhistory statement is between 03:11-03:17, which goes:\n\n&gt; In the early 1900s, the US military was relatively small: **a product of non-interventionism** and reticence for war.\n\nIn this post, I will attempt to provide examples and events which showcase the United States of America was far from non-interventionist in the early 1900s, with some stuff from the 1800s as well for a bit of clariifcation.\n\n**Ultimate mega nitpick: Ahoy used the 50 star flag rather than an appropriate 45-48-star flag when discussing early 1900s USA.**\n\n--------\n\n##The concept of interventionism and USA's foreign policy in the Americas.\n\n###Definition of interventionism\n\nFirst we must describe the definition of interventionism, for this situation I'll simply use the act to influence something that is not under one's control. In this case being the USA attempting to influence other states, primarily in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n###Was the USA non-interventionist?\n\nI would say it is next to impossible to call the United States \"non-interventionist\" in any shape or form in the early 1900s. I could just do some meme thing like say \"Teddy Roosevelt\" and end the whole post here but I believe that would not quite show exactly how much the USA meddled in the affairs of other nations. I will try to limit my examples as well though as I do not want to write a mega-giga wall of text showing examples of USA meddling everywhere.\n\n------\n\n##From Teddy to Wilson\n\n###Teddy Roosevelt and Colombia\n\nOne can trace USA's interests in an interoceanic canal all the way to the early 1800s. In the 1820s there was was even an attempt to get a right to construct a canal through Central America.^1 Now during Teddy Roosevelt's presidency, USA was about to sign a treaty with Colombia that would allow them to construct a Panama canal. The Colombian government had to delay the ratification of the treaty due to an insurgency in Panama. The United States in response would essentially nullify an 1846 treaty that they had signed with Colombia, which said that the USA would help suppress any independence struggles or uprisings staged against Colombia.^2 What would happen next is the USA would block off the route to the isthmus of Panama, preventing the Colombian government from suppressing the insurrection. Once that was done the USA would sign a treaty with the newly formed Panama state to begin the construction of a panama canal, whilst explaining to Colombia that they have already entered relations with Panama and recognise them as an independent state.^3 Aside from that you also have USA's involvement in the Venezuela crisis of 1902-03 when discussing Teddy Roosevelt's presidency.\n\n###Taft, Wilson and Nicaragua\n\nUSA and Nicaragua is more of a shitfest. In 1909 a Nicaraguan force rose up against the then ruler of Nicaragua, president Zelaya. The USA was interested in knocking out Zelaya since he was perceived as a dictator but was also seen as a threat to American sovereignty by attempting to hand over rights to build a canal to a non-American country, and since the USA was the only one to interpret the Monroe Doctrine, it was seen as an additional threat. USA's role in this was deploying its navy in 1910, stopping the blockade of Bluefields, thus saving the badly beaten Conservative army and also taking away one of the government's main sources of income - customs. Zelaya's government fell and a Conservative government was installed.^4 \n\nTo shorten it a bit, a problem arose. It was that the liberals were fiercely Anti-American while the Conservatives relied on the American military to stay in power, since liberals outnumbered the Conservatives. Another insurgency organised by the liberals this time broke out in 1912, resulting in the USA intervening once more and keeping the Conservatives in power. As Bernard put it:\n\n&gt;First of all, the Conservatives retained their precarious hold on the Presidency, but their power rested on the presence of a strong Marine detachment at the Managua legation. In addition, American diplomats managed to forestall a split in Conservative ranks.^5\n\n-----\n\n\n##Woodrow \"the world must be made safe for democracy\" Wilson\n\nWoodrow Wilson's administration also played a role in Nicaragua. Primarily with the 1916 election. In 1916 the Conservatives experienced what the Republicans had experienced in the 1913 election, a \"split\". The USA experienced a dilemma in that if they let a fair election occur, the anti-American liberals would win which would cause problems as the USA had signed a treaty with Nicaragua which made Nicaragua lease out 2 strategic islands to the USA for 99 years {[Article 2 of Bryan-Chamorro treaty](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/b-ni-ust000010-0379.pdf)} [Edit: accidentally added an 1850s treaty, whoops). However, if they let the current Conservative government (Diaz) to supervise the election, Diaz's opposing conservative party would win, risking the chance of the Liberals and majority of Conservatives ganging up on the government and causing even bigger problems. USA ended up teaming up with the Diaz government, preventing the Liberal candidate from running in the 1916 election under justification of being formerly associated with the dictator Zelaya.^6  To conclude on Nicaragua the USA attempted to maintain a government that would be pro-American in nature, albeit being aware of Conservatives making up the minority and even in fact receiving letters from Nicaraguans explaining how they are oppressing them.\n\n### Woodrow Wilson and Mexico\n\nThis is probably the biggest one but I'll limit to explaining that the USA intervened constantly during the early stages of the Mexican revolution. After some misunderstanding, the United States occupied Veracruz and demanded a 21-gun salute from the then ruler of Mexico, Huerta. Aside from that the Americans received information that the Germans were supplying Huerta and the United States wanted to stop the shipping, since the USA didn't really like the generalissimo.^7 You, of course, also have the whole Pancho Villa expedition with Pershing, where the United States would even engage with Mexican forces in Carrizal.\n\n###What about Europe?\n\n&gt;But OP! This is mainly the Americas, what if Ahoy meant Europe?\n\nThat'd be a bit cheeky and also confusing as he should have been more clearer then. Aside from that, even before 1917, the USA (perhaps it'd be better to say Woodrow Wilson) attempted to meddle in the affairs of Europe, especially in the early stages of the First World War. After the first battle of the Marne, Woodrow Wilson in fact attempted to force a ceasefire between two sides and begin negotiations for peace.^8  However this example is less relevant as Ahoy was talking about the military previously.\n\n--------\n\n\n###The US military - small because of non-interventionism?\n\nThis is where it gets a bit more tricky and I have less knowledge of. The US military was \"relatively small\" (in comparison to Europe I presume) because it did not need a massive military to fulfill its goals, could nations such as Nicaragua or or Colombia even remotely threaten the industrial powerhouse that was the USA? Besides, there was the whole concept of \"impregnable fortress\", in which it would be next to impossible to invade the United States of America due to its geographical isolation, an argument that future isolationist political figures would use in the 1930s and early stages of WW2.^9 Furthermore, the USA was more interested in a larger navy thanks to Mahan's book, explaining how the USA must expand its trade and territory, and the only way to protect the two is by possessing a strong navy.^10 Of course, there's more to it than that; like the fact that the USA had a large surplus of money in the treasury in the 1890s, making it the perfect time to begin a large naval project. The focus on the navy may lead some to mistakenly conclude that the USA's military overall was small. While for the army itself, that may be correct, but for the navy it is definitely not. In fact, who can forget Teddy Roosevelt's \"Great White Fleet\"? And, if I am not mistaken, the USA possessed the 3rd largest navy in the world by the time it was involved in WW1.\n\n-------\n\n###Conclusion\n\nWhile Ahoy makes very enjoyable videos, it does not necessarily mean he is free from badhistory, or mistakes in general. I am not attempting to slander neither Ahoy, nor the United States of America. One could gladly perhaps provide an explanation to some interventions  (like Nicaragua) being attempts to maintain stability in the Americas in the first place, however the point of this post was to simply show that the USA was more than \"isolationist\" in the early 1900s and more people should know that. I will conclude this with one of my favourite Woodrow Wilson quotes; I'd say that it explains US foreign policy in the early 1900s rather well:\n\n&gt;I am going to teach the Latin American republics to elect good men!\n\n--------\n\n##Footnotes\n\n1.

        "author": "Hergrim",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8v1gai/the_real_truth_about_leather_armour/",
        "text": "I've recently been thinking a lot about the medieval Western European use of leather armour, and the counter culture pop-historian trend of denying its existence beyond limb armour. Since Shadiversity is one of the worst offenders in this regard (especially when it comes to arrogantly asserting his case with poorly thought out thought experiments) and also one of the most popular, I thought I'd tackle his videos on the subject.\n\nThere are two that I've seen, [The TRUTH about padded and leather armor (Gambeson / Aketon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODS7ksbBRuE) and [Why padded armor (gambeson) is WAY better than leather armor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uWDCDJD_4w). These are fairly short videos and I'd like to tackle this thematically, so I won't be using time stamps, just summaries of Shad's positions. They are (in no particular order):\n\n1) That there's no evidence for leather armour\n\n2) That leather armour would be more expensive than textile armour\n\n3) That a gambeson was as protective, if not more so, than leather armour and could be repaired more easily\n\n4) That a poor peasant would want to buy a gambeson so that they have something to wear with their mail if they can ever afford it.\n\n**The Evidence for Leather Armour**\n\nThere are three main sources of evidence for leather armour: linguistic, textual and artistic. Of these, the latter is the weakest thanks to what likely comes down to the fashion of the period, but we do have some depictions of it. More, in fact, than we do of the aketon. First, though, let's look at the linguistic evidence.\n\nThe linguistic evidence is twofold. First, and most importantly, is the word \"cuirass\". \"Cuirass\" was first thought to have show up in the inventory of the effects of Eudes, Comte de Nevers, drawn up after his death in 1266. At this stage, the form it took was of of *cuirace* (as in *paires de cuiraces*) and is clearly armour for the body. However, Provencal poetry from the early 13th century often uses the word *coirassas* and points to an earlier date for the adoption of the term. In any case, the word \"cuirass\" is derived from the French \"cuir\", which means \"leather/animal hide\" and likely replaced the earlier term for leather armour, the *cuirie*, which first shows up in the mid-12th century.\n\nA less concrete, although extremely interesting linguistic link is the use of \"lorica\" in 13th century England to refer to the tawing or otherwise treatment of leather. The Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources cites three uses of the term in this manner, all in the 13th century. While the time frame might not be significant in and of itself, the fact that it's connected to the act of tanning is most likely the result of leather armour being in use.\n\nThe second source of information we have for leather body armour is textual. This is the biggest body of evidence and comes from both literature and account books.\n\nWace, writing in the 1160s, mentions the use of leather armour used by some of the Norman infantry at Hastings and, though he was writing a century after the events, Wace is considered to be a reliable source on the equipment and tactics of his own times. Also around this time - a little earlier, in fact - we have mention of leather armour in the *Chronique des Ducs de Normandie*, although it is only used in connection to the Norman Conquest and doesn't come up again.\n\nAround 1180, Walter Mappin mentions that Brabacon mercenaries typically wore leather jerkins that \"protected them from head to foot\", which might simply be textile armour with a leather outer layer, while Guillamine le Breton makes mention in his *Philippides* of *curie* worn with textile armour and Provencal poems of the 13th century refer to the *coirassas*. According to David Nicolle,*cuire* is a frequent term used in late 12th and 13th century French sources.\n\nMoving firmly into the 13th century, Plano Carpini recommended the use of \"doubled cuirasses\" (and not, apparently, \"double mail\" as the usual translation is) when fighting against the Mongols and the *corazas*/*coirassas* became widespread in Spain for both infantry and cavalry and the *burdas pieles* (some form of leather protection) became the signature equipment of the *amluvagars*. Leather armour was so common in Spain that the *cuyrace* makers of Barcelona had their own guild by 1257.\n\nIn Italy, we see the *corellus* and *corettum* in Genoese sources from 1222 onwards, where it was used alongside the *osbergum* (mail shirt) and *panceria* (textile armour). It was most often associated with the *panceria* in the rental agreements, and the price was generally on par with or below the price of the *panceria*. Importantly, the price of the *corellus* and *correttum* was always less than the cost of an *osbergum*.\n\nDuring the second half of the 13th century, the use of leather armour except in tournaments appears to have dropped off significantly and been relegated mostly to limb armour and helmets, where it would survive well into the 14th and even 15th centuries (Chaucer's knight wears greaves of boiled leather and some of the archers at Agincourt wore boiled leather caps).  \n\nThere also seem to have been some attempts to reinforce the leather armour with metal plates towards the end of the first half of the thirteenth century, though the evidence for this is most limited of all, consisting of a single textual reference and a couple of possible artistic depictions.\n\nWe have relatively few artistic depictions of leather armour. The clearest is probably the man sitting on the cart in the [Morgan Bible](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Morgan-bible-fl27.jpg), and who might also be wearing a boiled leather cap. Another is a figure from the English *Apocalypse* of 1250-1275 (Gulbenkian Ms. L.A. 139), who appears to be wearing a similar style of armour with four round metal reinforcements, and A.V.B. Norman found a wall painting dating from around 1227 in the Baptistery of St. Gerone's in Cologne that also features a man in this style of armour and found a possible match on the effigy of Hugo, Chatelain of Ghent (died 1232). Claude Blair also interprets the anonymous effigy of a knight from the third quarter of the thirteenth century in Penshore Church, Worchester as wearing a leather cuirass (due to no evidence of a similar style of metal armour existing before the 14th century) and another in the Temple Church, London.\n\nThis is essentially the sum total of our artistic depictions of leather - or possible leather - armour. However, while it might seem scare, it is a monumental amount compared to artistic depictions of aketons under mail. While we have good textual evidence of aketons being worn under mail from the mid-12th century on and also have an extent fragment of one (the Sleeve of St. Martin) that dates from the somewhere between the mid-12th and mid-13th century, we have no artistic evidence of anything being worn under mail other than a linen shirt through almost to the end of the 13th century. The Morgan Bible, although it has a couple of instances of [gambesons being](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b4/7b/9f/b47b9f6cc1a64773ae08957748da22d5.jpg) [worn over mail](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8c/d8/a9/8cd8a94cb8eba1615a4abc7cfa00a151.jpg), explicitly shows that mail was worn over nothing but an ordinary tunic. This is despite some pretty good textual evidence of the practice from the same time period.\n\nNow, it could just be that aketons weren't used by everyone until the end of the 13th century, or it could be that they were so often under the mail that most manuscript illuminators didn't know they existed or how to draw them until much later on. Whatever the case may be, the point is that art alone can't be used to confirm or deny the existence of a type of armour. It needs to be used in conjunction with a raft of other sources to be properly interpreted.\n\nIn short, leather armour was absolutely in use in Western Europe during the Middle Ages, for a period of at least a century. Whether it might have been used before the mid-12th century and the degree to which it might have been used after the end of the 13th century we can't really say. What we can say, though, is that it was quite widespread.\n\n**On the Price of Leather Armour**\n\nAs I've already mentioned, mid-13th century Italian sources indicate a rough parity in price between leather and textile armour, with the leather armour almost always being the cheaper of the two when there was a price difference. The only other price for any kind of leather armour - a *quiretis* for Edward I's tournament in 1278 - was 3 shillings, thought I don't have any reference for the price at that time. Later aketons (from 1294-1339) could cost between 12d and 160d, with an average of 67d (1s. to 13s.4d with an average of 5s.7d), while a gambeson might cost only 28d (2s.4d, although the same size is 1/10th that of the aketons and might not represent the average market price).\n\nThere's another way to compare prices, though, and that's to look at the cost of the raw materials. The price of a raw ox or cow hide in England during the 1270s Generally varied between 1 and 3 shillings, but was most often within 5d of 2 shillings. There was some variation between locations, but the price was frequently similar between locations. At around the same time, linen for clothing could vary between 2d and 8.25d per ell, but was mostly around 4d. Clifford Rogers notes that 183 ells of cloth was procured for one of Edward I's aketons which, if all used, would have resulted in 50 to 80 layers. Working off this (2.3-3.7 ells of cloth per layer), a three layer aketon made using cheap cloth- excluding any cotton, old rags, old blanket or other stuffing material - would cost 1s.7d. even before factoring in the labour needed to construct it. The stuffing could very well bring the cost up to 2s., and the sewing a few pence more.\n\nOn the other hand, a stand alone gambeson (although this is something of a misnomer as gambesons were often worn with an aketon during the late 13th century), which would need to have *at least* 20 layers, and more probably 25 layers with a deer skin of 30 layers on its own, is going to cost 8s.8d. in cheap linen alone. Clearly, this is not cheap armour, especially when leather armour might be had for as little as 3s.\n\n**On the Relative Protective Qualities of Textile and Leather Armours**\n\nUnfortunately, no one has yet to do a proper, comprehensive test of the various possible leather armour candidates or the various forms textile armour probably took. The two best are David Jones' [Arrows Against Linen and Leather Armour](https://www.academia.edu/5520314/Arrows_Against_Linen_and_Leather_Armour), which only tests untreated leather and unquilted linen, and Alan William's tests in *The Knight and the Blast Furnace*, which didn't test plain leather and didn't test the buff leather against the lance or the cuir-bouilli against the arrowhead. Nonetheless, some useful information is available.\n\nThe first is that leather performed substantially better against the bladed arrowheads in Jones' test than the linen, while the linen did better against the long and Tudor bodkin arrows. The best all round combination - for protection and weight - was the leather paired with several layers of linen.\n\nThe second, from Williams, is that while the cuir-bouilli required an extra 10j to be cut with a blade than 16 layers of quilted linen, the simulated lance head only required 30j to penetrate it while the quilted linen required 50j. The quilted jack (26 layers) required 200j to fully cut.\n\nThere are some limitations to these examples. The linen armour used by Jones would almost certainly have performed better if it had been quilted, while Williams probably wasn't using boiled rawhide as his cuir-bouilli, which offers better protection than boiled leather, and his blade was short (40mm) and designed to simulate the cut of a polearm, not a sword.\n\nAs a result, the precise protective qualities of each armour can't really be determined. However, regarding the imparting of energy, one of Shad's criticisms of leather armour, Samuel James Levin's thesis on cuir-bouilli demonstrates quite well that treated leather armour can significantly reduce the impact of a blow when worn over some type of padding as compared to when there's just the padding.\n\nRegarding Shad's use of the Mike Loades' clip, Mike Loades, Steve Stratton and Mark Stretton have been pretty open that the arrow that failed to penetrate was the shortest bodkin they could find and that the needle bodkin (the most probably military arrowhead of the period) penetrated straight through without any trouble. The producers just decided against showing it because it didn't fit their narrative.\n\nFinally, we come to ease of repair. Honestly? You're probably not going to be replacing layers of damaged textile armour unless you've got a bit of spare cash. Every 3 layers is a shilling for good cloth or every 6 for low quality cloth. Once you factor in the labour of taking the whole garment apart (or maybe just one half it's a two layer construction) and then resewing it, you're probably looking at a good chunk of your weekly wage - if not all of it - during the period where leather armour was most often used. Replacing leather armour, on the other had, isn't going to be cheap either.\n\nReally, your best bet is to hide behind your shield and try to avoid getting hit. If you are hit, then sewing up the damage (or maybe gluing it in place and using a linen patch for the leather armour) is probably your best bet until you get paid or find some good loot.\n\n**The gambeson as a form of future proofing**\n\nI don't think I need to go into any great detail on this. Textile armour that was worn under a gambeson or mail is going to be much thinner and lighter because its primary goal is to reduce the impact and it plays a relatively minor role in the defence. Even when you get to the 6 layers of linen + a layer of blanket for the Burgundians or the 10 layer jack required for a mail shirt, also for the Burgundians, it's still a pretty thin garment that offers marginal protection, and even then will be a couple of shillings or so.\n\nA stand alone textile defence is going to be much thicker and heavier, possibly as much as ten kilograms. And, although Shad's perfectly comfortable with his low number of cloth layers, mostly cotton batting gambeson, twenty or thirty layers of quilted linen is going to be pretty stiff.\n\nBasically, they're two different, and usually complementary, forms of defence and you're not going to buy an aketon and risk life and limb on the off chance that you can eventually pick up some mail, and you're not going to try and wear mail over your thick, fairly stiff gambeson if you're rich enough to afford some stand alone armour.\n\n**Sources**\n\n*European Armour*, by Claude Blair\n\n*Companion to Medieval Arms and Armour*, ed. by David Nicolle\n\n*Soldiers' Lives Throughout History: The Middle Ages*, by Clifford J.

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster. If any part of this post has bad history, please correct me.\n\nI loved The Sound of Music as a kid, and I still love it now. However, they play and movie were not a very accurate depiction of the real Von Trapp family. In other words, the play and movie were bad history, so here we are. If you want to have your childhood ruined more than when you found out that Christopher Plummer hated the movie, read on.\n\n**Maria was not a bad nun.**\n\nWhile I did read that Maria described having a hard time adjusting to all the rules of the Abbey, it does not sound like she was as bad at nunning as the movie portrayed. The actual reason that the Abbey sent her to be a tutor for one of the Von Trapp daughters (not as a governess for all the children!) was because she had teacher training and because they were worried about her health. Nuns live a pretty shut-in lifestyle, and it was taking its toll on Maria. In Rodgers and Hammerstein’s defense, \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria's Health?\" would probably not have been a good song.\n\n**Georg Von Trapp was not an asshole, and Maria was not a perfect angel.**\n\nIn the movie, Captain Von Trapp is cold and strict, not allowing any music or happines in his house until he hears the children singing beautifully, does a complete 180, and becomes a sweet and caring father again. The real Georg Von Trapp was not at any point in his life allergic to fun and would sing and play music with his children quite frequently before Maria came along.\n\nThe play and film also left out the short temper Maria had. Her stepdaughter described her temper, saying, “\\[She\\] had a terrible temper. . . . And from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\" (\\[[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2005/winter/von-trapps.html](https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2005/winter/von-trapps.html))\n\nMy original title for this section was “Georg Von Trapp was not an asshole, but Maria could be sometimes.” But then, a couple of things happened: I saw clips of the real Maria Von Trapp and felt bad saying something like that about her. I also realized that it didn’t make her an asshole, it made her human, especially considering the horrible childhood she had.\n\n**Maria and Georg got married long before they had to escape Austria.**\n\nIn the film, they are on their honeymoon when the Third Reich annexes Austria. In reality, they were married in 1927 and escaped in 1938. In between those dates, the Great Depression happened and they lost all their wealth. The reason the Von Trapp Family Singers were formed (in real life, the Trapp Family Singers) was money. Performing and touring allowed them to survive financially. Speaking of escaping Austria…\n\n**The family’s escape via the Alps in the movie not only did not happen, it would have been geographically impossible.**\n\nIn the movie, Austrian borders have been closed, so Captain Von Trapp decides that they will escape from the Nazis by hiking over the Alps to get to Switzerland.

        "text": "A recent thread popped up on the Europa Universalis IV forum, giving me an excuse to do another Ottoman history write-up (also known as procrastination). Let’s get right down to business. The quoted posts are not all by the same people, and they don’t represent the full extent of the bad history.\n\n&gt; In real life, how did the Ottomans fare against major powers?\n&gt; From what research I've done, it seems like the Ottomans only won major wars against Hungary in the timeline, with one major win over the PLC in 1676. It seems like almost every other war they were involved in in Europe ended in status quo or Ottoman defeat. I'm just trying to get my head around why the Ottomans are represented as being so invincible in the game when history shows that time and time again they were defeated by powers that had less territory and less manpower than they did.\n\nSo, naturally the whole premise of this discussion thread is going to be divorced from history because Europa Universalis is a computer game and you can’t graft history onto it in any kind of “realistic” way. But let’s evaluate this idea: did the Ottomans only ever win wars against Hungary and Poland during this timeline (e.g. 1444-1821)? The answer is no, but I can see why one might assume that. This poster’s historical imagination is probably being distorted in two ways. First, by the notion that the Ottoman conquest of Hungary was a quick one-on-one war in 1526, after which the country was annexed. Second, by the idea that the period after the 1683 Siege of Vienna was one of continual Ottoman defeat and territorial loss, such that this poster is either not aware of later Ottoman victories or else chooses to ignore them because they only resulted in regaining previously held territory (such as the victory over Russia in 1711 and over Austria in 1739).\n\nAs for Hungary - after the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Ottomans only annexed a handful of Hungarian border forts. Hungary itself descended into civil war between factions supporting the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand (the brother of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) and Jan Zápolya, a Transylvanian noble who was supported by the Ottomans. The Habsburgs ultimately gained the upper hand and this necessitated Ottoman intervention to eject Habsburg troops from Buda in 1529, after which they proceeded to unsuccessfully lay siege to Vienna. Buda was later lost to the Habsburgs again, prompting another Ottoman intervention in 1541, which began the process of Ottoman annexation. Over several more decades, until 1568, the Ottomans continued to clash with the Habsburgs, ultimately bringing most of Hungary under their control. The Ottoman conquest of Hungary was therefore not just a victory over the Hungarian kingdom, but over the Habsburgs as well. It wasn’t a matter of “conquering Hungary and then being beaten by the Habsburgs on the other side” as is sometimes imagined. Annexing Hungary entailed defeating the Habsburgs there.\n\n&gt; [Lepanto] was a short term victory for the Ottomans […] Though the Ottomans ended up capturing most of the Maghreb afterwards, it was unable to invade Italy and allowed European [Spanish] technology to get ahead in the form of the Galleon and the Ottomans were never really able to compensate for this technological difference again. Not only did Lepanto mark the end of the oared ship and pave the way for the Age of Sail, but it also began the long technological decline of the Ottomans that they were never really able to recover from.\n\nIt's interesting to me how people influenced by strategy games seem to conceptualize early modern geopolitics as if the states involved were fighting World War II. Lepanto or no Lepanto, the Ottomans weren’t on the verge of invading Italy, that would be a ridiculous undertaking. By the 1570s galley warfare in the Mediterranean was already winding down largely for economic reasons relating to the financial strain and rising costs of warfare occurring everywhere in the late sixteenth century, as well as the dwindling gains to be made from naval campaigns. As for their navy in the ensuing decades – its quality did deteriorate, but not for the reasons listed here. As noted by Svat Soucek (*Ottoman Maritime Wars, 1416-1700.* Istanbul: The Isis Press, 2015), the Ottomans maintained their technical standards and adapted galleons into their fleet with the same rapidity of other Mediterranean states. What they lacked in the seventeenth century was practical experience in naval warfare and a large body of skilled sailors to draw their manpower from, ultimately leading to repeated defeats at the hands of Venice, until they were able to build up experience again. But it’s much more simple and attractive to blame everything on a “long decline that they were never really able to recover from.” We have seen that this idea is ubiquitous. And wrong.\n\n&gt; Reading the Ottoman primary sources regarding warfare a constant complaint of the leaders of the troops, both the good and bad ones is the lack of firearms and lack of its disemination amongst Ottoman troops. Wether it was fighting Venetians, Austrians or Spaniards the Ottomans up to and even in 1700's struggled to equip a significant portion of their army with firearms. Large sections of their ground forces were composed of horsemen. Bows, swords, shields, chainmail, and horde cavalry tactics were standard even while European military taught developed anti cavalry squares, rank fire and infantry as basis for conducting warfare. \n\nI don’t know what primary sources he’s supposedly been reading, but this flies in the face of what historians of the Ottoman Empire believe. The Ottomans were totally self-sufficient in the production of firearms and had no trouble equipping their troops, so much so that according to Gábor Ágoston, “Ottoman stockpiles of weapons and ammunition greatly outnumbered (and often doubled) the weapons and ammunition stores of their Hungarian and Habsburg adversaries as late as the 1680s.” (*Guns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the Ottoman Empire.* Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005.) The Ottoman army shifted after the early seventeenth century to be primarily an infantry force equipped with firearms, and we have very early evidence of their use of volley tactics as well. From a technical standpoint, they were basically equivalent to their rivals.\n\n&gt; In sieges the Ottoman were AWFUL since ever. The siege age ability is just to help them to finish the wars faster to give some pace to their conquests, but historically should be something like -2 to siege rolls.\n\nGiven that the Ottomans were/are famous for their skill in siege warfare, this is a confusing statement.\n\n“Sieges were more common than field battles, and were a form of warfare in which the Ottomans excelled.” (Colin Imber, *The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: The Structure of Power.* 2nd edition. Hampshire: Palgrave Macmilllan, 2009)\n\n“Until well into the seventeenth century, but especially in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Ottoman artillery proved to be superior against European fortifications. In the Central European theater of war, by 1526 the Ottomans had conquered all the key forts of the Hungarian defense system that had guarded the southern borders of the kingdom and that had successfully halted Ottoman advance in the fifteenth century. Between 1521 and 1566 only thirteen Hungarian forts were able to resist Ottoman firepower for more than ten days, merely nine castles for more than twenty days, and altogether four fortresses were able to fully withstand Ottoman assaults. However only one fortress, Köszeg, was besieged by the main military force of the Sultan. The others were attacked by Ottoman troops led either by the Grand Vizier or by the governor general of Buda, that is, by armies representing smaller numbers of deployed troops and firepower. Three of the four fortresses were later captured, within one, ten, and forty-four years, respectively, despite Habsburg efforts at reinforcement and modernization.” (Gábor Ágoston, *Guns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the Ottoman Empire.* Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005.)",

        "text": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMgjDUt-2f8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMgjDUt-2f8)\n\n0:44 'In the beginning of the 19th century, a new era of interconnections had swept the globe, and the term 'international' was born.'\n\nThe word international was first recorded in the 18th century.\n\nRicardo was influenced by Wealth of Nation in 1799, and his famously argued for free trade in his  'On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,' published 1817, but people were already discussing international trade before that just view rather in a mercantile lens till Adam Smith.\n\n1:22 'They needed China' and proceeded to show us the map of modern PRC. The Qing Empire's map looks like this.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ifjPGpH](https://imgur.com/a/ifjPGpH)\n\n14 years before the First Opium War. Notice the difference in territory that will eventually be lost to Mongolia and Russia.\n\n1:27 'China, in fashion with other oriential nations of the period, remained self-isolated.'\n\nContrary to popular belief, UNTIL the Opium Wars, the East Asians participated in the group exercise known as the Tributary System. They were not isolated, they communicated with each other constantly, traded with each other constantly, and generally annoyed each other constantly (looking at you Japan and Korea.) We have cases where Vietnam send mission to meet with the emperor once a year or once three years, depending on the period, and Korea sending missions more than once a year. Japan traded with nations such as Korea, China, Vietnam and more. Togukawa shogunate has sent messages to the ruler of Vietnam on instructions on which ships are properly Japanese ships, and which ships are pirates.\n\n1:30 'Demands for their resources like silk, porcelain and tea went through the roof, and this created a large trade imbalance, since the Chinese had no wish for any western goods.'\n\nCorrection, Chinese demand for western silver was always there. Problem lies with how the British need to get the silver to pay for Chinese goods. Silver is after all, a commodity. Unfortunately, British used Gold Standard and that was an issue where they had to purchase silver, use silver to pay for Chinese goods, and Qing government took a 20&amp;#37; cut and various other local fees (often by corrupted officials and local traders.)\n\n3:30 'This was when it discovered poppies grew incredibly well upon the land, and it produced rich opium, which the Chinese highly desired.'\n\nI think everyone who was addicted to opium highly desired opium.\n\nIn any case, the Chinese used poppies as a medicine, and did not use it for 'recreational' purposes. It was recorded in 1596's Compendium of Materia Medica. According to Modern Chinese History by Xu Zhongyue, it was still mainly use as medicine and not for enjoyment in the Ming era.\n\n\\----------\n\nWe need to mention WHY Qing wanted to stop Opium Trade. Qing Empire depended on western import of silver IF western merchants kept buying Chinese goods. That is, if England bought all these goods but pay for it with Opium, that is a huge problem for Qing where they are hit with inflation WITHOUT silver entering to offset the negative aspect of inflation, at the same time, the Qing empire is now losing silver as they need to pay for the opium import, causing huge headache for the government.\n\n/edit 2: As [scarlet\\_sage](https://www.reddit.com/user/scarlet_sage) suggested, this might not be inflation. What China faced was an increase in demand for the consumer goods, a sharp decrease in silver intake, a sharp increase in silver export, and a sharp increase in opium import.  Huang Jueci request to Daoguang Emperor in 1838, when consume often, you then must consume often, that is call addiction, it takes time away and you might lose your job, you would felt as if your life depends on it, those who were afflicted were often weak, their face gray and teeth black, they might know it's danger but cannot do about it, there are government officials and local gentries who were afflicted on top, and to the bottom the workers the merchants the actors and servants and woman, monks, priests, they all use them. From the Third Year of Daoguang to 11th, yearly we lost 17m liang of silver, from 11th to 14th, 20m liang, and from 14th till today, more than 30m liang. If we consider the ports such as Fujian, ZHejiang, Shangdong, Tianjing's various ports, these are several tens of million more. We now use the limited wealth of middle kingdom, and fill the bottomless greed of the foreign states. These are harmful to men, and we will be concern about it's affliction on the state, day after day, year after year, no one knows when it will end. \n\n1 liang = 35g. \n\n\\--------------\n\n6:25 'and so a naval battle broke out, beginning the First Opium War, September 4th, 1839.'\n\nExcept Eliot communicated with the Qing and agreed to do join searches on the ships. If no opium were found, trade continue as usual, but if opium was found, then cargo would be confiscated and merchant expelled.\n\nSo really, war hasn't broken out.\n\n6:39 'Through these blockades and the conquering of islands, it became clear the Chinese army was no match for the modernized British. Predominantly equipped with bows, spears, and swords, matchlock rifles were a rare sight amongst their numbers.'\n\nOne problem is the misunderstanding of the Manchu doubled ear bow. A typical Manchu mounted archer could pull at least 80lb, with it's arrow energy at 130j. This is roughly equal to 780j in penetration power of a musket.  (Round vs sharp) A strong Manchu warrior would pull 7 - 8 stones (93-106lb), so they would be able to go even higher and would match 1000j. The Baker Rifle would fire at 850j while the Brown Bess 2600 j. So depending on which weapon was used. And while on paper, the penetrative power of the rifle is vastly superior, neither side wore armor, so if you get hit by either, you are pretty much dead. Of course, there is a difference between troops stationed in Canton and the field armies, once you add in the training, fire support from warships, and the execution of the commanders by Qishan, the Qing military morale collapsed and a peasant army could probably beat them at that time.\n\nQing also employed arquebus throughout their army, and some army would go as high as 40-50&amp;#37;. However, arquebus was at this point far inferior to the modernized British army.\n\nSo while what this statement said is technically true, I want to make sure people didn't think the Qing army was a bunch of rabble using toy bow. The Manchu Bow was an amazing bow, and Qing army had firearms. Just at this point, needed a bit of a upgrade from WindowsXP when people are using whatever Microsoft is selling now. I mean, it's a good weapon, but update is probably necessary.\n\n8:25 ''The final large scale offensive of the war resulted in British taking of the city of Zheijang.'\n\nThere are no city called Zheijang. There is a province Zhejiang, and there is this city Zhenjiang that was captured. But no Zheijang.\n\n8:44 'cede Hongkong to Great Britian.'\n\nHong Kong (how we use the term anyways) is composed Hong Kong island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. Hong Kong island was ceded in the First Opium War, Kowloon was ceded in the Second Opium War, and New Territorites was leased in 1899.\n\n11:17 '... and the people's faith in the Qing dynasty has been severely shaken. Revolutions an small-scale wars tore the Qing Empire apart piece by piece, finally ending it with the Wuchang uprising in 1911.'\n\nQing fought off one of the largest civil war in 1850-1864, the Taiping Rebellion, coinciding with the Second Opium War from 1856 - 1860. Had the people's faith in Qing severely shaken, there was no way for Qing to come back after losing the wealthy territory of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, part of Hubei, and part of Jiangsu. Qing court was broke, they fully delegated power to local provincials who were mostly Han. Had the people decided, fuck it, we are done with the Manchu rule, Qing would have ended once the Jiangbei camp was captured. Qing had no field army left. The Chu, Hui, and Xiang army that form the backbone of Qing empire were formed by local gentries and militia raised by the gentries.\n\nThe people's faith is difficult to gauge, but the ruling elites did not lose faith until Dezong Emperor decided to abolish the CSE, which effectively severed the dynasty from it's natural core group of supporters who had money, power, and army. That would be my argument at least.\n\nSources:\n\nStephen Selby, CHINESE ARCHERY,\n\nElliot, Mark C, THE MANCHU WAY: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China.\n\nAlan Williams,  The Knight and the Blast Furnace\n\nBook of Qing\n\nTreaty of Nanking\n\nConvention of Peking\n\nKang, David C, East Asia Before the West: Five Centuries of Trade and Tribute\n\n/edit: long ear bow, not double ear bow",

        "text": "Source: [https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/us/los-angeles-student-kkk-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/us/los-angeles-student-kkk-trnd/index.html)\n\nTLDR: A high school history teacher gave the OK for a Freshman to dress up as a historical figure for his final project. The student had selected former KKK leader Hiram Wesley Evans.  Student goes to school in full KKK costume. Controversy Occurs.\n\nThe BadHistory:\n\n&gt;\"It was hard to believe that (**the teacher**) would allow a Klansman to  walk around from her approval. So, we asked her, and she ... **compared  the Klan to the Black Panther Party**, which in my opinion are two  different things,\" rising senior Trinity Young told KABC. \"So yeah, it  was troubling.\"\n\nFirst Off, how the hell did a guy just pick up a KKK outfit?\n\nSecondly, considering the quote is not directly from the source (the teacher), I hope that the teacher's points are just misconstrued, or wrongly paraphrased. But, for the purpose of this post, I will attack the idea that the Black Panther Party (BPP) and the KKK are similar, besides generalities.\n\nTreating the Black Panther Party and the KKK as comparable parties is naive at best, terribly dishonest at worst. The study of History (in my own words) is the addition of context to past events and people, and how previous actions create consequences. While the BPP and the KKK are both social movements founded in Race Politics, and both did Social Activism to advance their race/ethnicity such as food drives and donations to the poor, grouping the BPP with the KKK is *bad* and ignores the context surrounding the two parties, their actions, and the environments of their birth.\n\n**The Status Quo**: The largest deviation between these two parties are their purpose. The KKK was (and is) a Reactionary political movement, Hell bent on restoring the 'Status Quo' of the antebellum or segregated south. The KKK has been born again 3-4 times, with the first being in response to Reconstruction, second time in response to Catholic immigrants, a flattering movie, and still black people, the third time in response to the Civil Rights Movement, and the fourth wave is \\[R2 Redacted\\]. Every time, the KKK is white society's urge to keep their cultural and political hold on the United States, and for a large part of its existence, the KKK was supported by 'moderate' whites and the Status Quo.\n\nOn the flip side, the BPP sought to undermine the racist Status Quo. The party did not wish to rekindle the old times of slavery (shocking /s). Instead it was about demolishing the unjust world they saw, which included breaking down capitalism! From the onset, the Black Panther Party worked to undermine the Status Quo, and in return, the Status Quo worked to undermine the Black Panthers.\n\n**Powerful Responses and Powerful Moves:** Another way of seeing the stark differences of these parties is noting how the government responded to them, and how powerful the parties were.\n\nWhile the third iteration of the KKK was infiltrated by the FBI [(source)](http://www.newsweek.com/us-governments-secret-war-kkk-651458), the first and second were not as prosecuted. During Reconstruction, the KKK was a terrorist organization, scaring, threatening, and killing Americans to repel the northern occupation. So when reconstruction failed, the KKK was successful, and the South was free to recreate a slave society with extra steps. The first Klan was strong enough, had enough popular support and was rewarded with a pseudo slave society for another century or so.\n\nThe Second Klan is a bit more straight forward. Lets use my home state as an example of the KKK interacted with power structures. The State of Indiana was unfortunately completely in the KKK's pocket. Fuck Face D.C. Stephenson grew the Indiana KKK organization to 250,000 men, which included 1/3 of all white males in Indiana at the time (Jesus Christ). With the Klan's help, republican (and apparently possible KKK member)  [Edward L. Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Jackson) was elected in 1924 and Dick Castle Stephenson was quoted saying \"I am the Law in Indiana\". \\[[wiki source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._C._Stephenson)\\] So to put it simply, just like the first Klan, the Second Klan was able to become so powerful, that the governments that could constrain or stop them ended up being controlled or directly influenced by them.\n\nNow for the Black Panther Party. The Panthers never had the power or powerful friends that the KKK had. At the height of their power in the late 1960s, the BPP had just 2,000 members \\[[source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-Panther-Party)\\]. A much lower number than the KKK. And unlike the KKK, the Black Panther Party wasn't getting elected into the federal government, but was being eradicated by it. These 2,000 members were called the 'the greatest threat to the internal security of the country' by the leader of the FBI (Hoover). And while both the third KKK and the Black Panthers were subjects to the FBI COINTELPRO program, Black Panthers, as a communist sect during Red Scare, were prioritized by the FBI.\n\n**Racial Framing:** It would be a mistake to say the Klan and the Black Panther Party were similar due to race. As in the KKK for whites, BPP for Blacks. This is bad because the two groups approach race very differently. The KKK is a White Supremacist organization, the BPP is NOT a Black Supremacist organization. This is a MAJOR difference, and grouping the BPP with the Klan because black people were in one, and white people were in the other, removes all context from the absurdly racist Klan, and the Marxist principles of the Panthers.\n\n**In conclusion:** Using the Black Panther Party's existence as a defense for allowing a kid to go to school in a KKK outfit strips the Black Panthers of its purpose and context and groups it with one of the largest, racist, and most successful terrorist organization of all time. That is badhistory, and we can only hope that this history teacher was misquoted in the report..\n\nExtra Sources: Dr. Janney's lectures on Civil War, Reconstruction, and Remembering the Civil War.\n\nEdited for clarity!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8racj2/neonazi_dr_william_luther_pierce_fails_to/",
        "text": "Hello fellow historians, today I will be debunking a particularly egregious piece of bad history from Dr. William L. Pierce. [Here is a link if any of you are interested in watching along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IgBRBfB7EE), though I warn you that the video is extremely racist and offensive. Pierce was an American physicist who became one of the leading figures in the American Nazi Party and would go on to start his own White Supremacist party called the National Alliance. Following this he started a cult, wrote White Supremacist fan-fiction, ranted about how everything is a Jewish conspiracy, and died in 2002. Unfortunately, before Pierce’s death he attracted a sizeable following and now more than a decade after his death White Supremacists still upload all his speeches to youtube, supposedly to trick people into thinking that because he had a doctorate he must be knowledgeable on the subjects he talks about. The video I will be discussing a segment of a speech Pierce made discussing the history of Haiti, and boy is it incorrect.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe video starts with a message saying “Destroy Zog” which is either outing the video creator as someone believing in a bogus conspiracy that Jews control the Earth or is a message that this guy really dislikes the former King of Albania. However, if the latter is the case then they’re a little late to the party as King Zog died back in 1961. This message is followed by a pretty racist message that i won’t repeat here simply because it’s really racist and has nothing to do with history, but it certainly prepares the viewer for the garbage that will follow later in the video.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPierce starts his history of Haiti by trying to paint a picture of what life was like in pre-revolutionary Saint Domingue to contrast it with what is to come in Haiti’s post-revolutionary history. Pierce describes the colony as prosperous with a social life rivaling that of the Metropole. This is all true enough but based on the images shown in the video it is implied that this is all exclusively White, which was not the case. Between 1753 and 1775 the free population of cities like Les Cayes, Saint Louis, and Nippe were between 25% and 40% colored and the affluent social scene Pierce describes contained families like the Ploys and Casamajors who were mulatto. It should be noted however that these freemen of color did not enjoy equal rights to their white counterparts. Also it is extremely important to note that this prosperity Saint Domingue was experiencing was due to the monumental amounts of slave labor employed on the colony’s sugar, coffee, and indigo plantations under some of the world’s most brutal and inhumane working conditions. And since Pierce neglects to mention it I feel it is important to stress just how large Saint Domingue’s enslaved population was, with the colony having 8 enslaved people for every 1 freeman. Shockingly, Pierce completely neglects to mention the system of slavery in place in the colony during his description of Saint Domingue.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter this pierce describes how “the democracy craze hit France” which he says made the white colonists of Saint Domingue emancipate their slaves due to political correctness. This is just incorrect. The ideals of the French Revolution inspired many of the slaves of Saint Domingue to pursue freedom and they revolted in 1791. Due to this revolt the free men of color in Saint Domingue were granted full civil and  political rights in order to enlist their aid in suppressing the revolting slaves. This wasn’t enough to end the revolt however and in 1793 Commissioner Sonthonax proclaimed that all slaves in the colony of Saint Domingue were to be free. Despite the fact that Sonthonax was an abolitionist, this was not done in an attempt to be politically correct but rather the commissioner’s attempt to regain control of a colony in chaos. And contrary to what Pierce says, the Whites of Saint Domingue weren’t complacently sitting about while the colony’s colored population fought for equal rights. Many whites, particularly the Petit Blancs, fought back against greater political equality between Whites and Blacks in any way they could, including a small uprising in 1792. A second White revolt in Le Cap in 1793 is ironically what led to an emancipation proclamation being issued for the able bodied male slaves of Le Cap who were willing to fight for the government in the suppression of any revolts in the colony.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter Pierce discusses the French population of Saint Domingue being killed he talks about how the French population’s books and paintings were “trinkets and baubles” to the Black population. This phrasing makes it seem as though the black population of Haiti had no idea what these items were or what their value was, but this was not the case. While it is true that the rural peasantry of Haiti would likely not appreciate the art of the French, the exact opposite was true for Haiti’s urban elites. In fact a sizeable literary tradition emerged in Haiti, beginning with their declaration of independence, and the urban elites had a fascination in both reading literature and creating their own works. As for painting, Haiti’s history in regards to painting is only a little younger than its history with literature. During his reign from 1811 to 1820 King Henri Christophe of Haiti was a patron of the arts and even started the first Haitian school for painting. So contrary to what Pierce’s statement implies Haiti would develop a culture rich in artistic expression.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point in the video I feel obligated to make a small point largely unrelated to history, but Pierce refers to Black people as subhuman in the video which is plainly not true. Black people are humans just like everyone else. I hope this point goes without the need to be explained further so I’ll move on with pointing out the rest of Pierce’s inaccuracies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo Pierce mentions how Haiti went from being one of the world’s wealthiest colonies to “an African level” of poverty. Right away I think it’s important to point out that the term “African level of poverty” is a useless term as Africa is a massive continent and has vastly varying levels of poverty depending on where you look and what time period you are discussing. Aside from that it’s important to point out why Haiti went from being so wealthy to so poor (as Pierce neglects to). Saint Domingue’s economy was based on the plantation system and the used slave labor to fuel its production of coffee, sugar, indigo, and other cash crops. During the revolution many plantations were destroyed either incidentally or purposefully and the French plantation system was destroyed. After the revolution many Haitian elites dreamed of restoring the plantation system  (though with themselves in charge this time) but this conflicted with the aspirations of the general population who simply wanted to manage their own lives. Thus a rural peasantry evolved in the nation of Haiti, which while infinitely more preferable to working under the plantation system, would never produce the same profits as the plantation system had. Haiti also faced further economic difficulties in terms of international trade as they were embargoed by not only their former colonial masters in France but also by the United States. These factors coupled with the monumental debt that Haiti was forced to pay France following its independence, a debt which would not be fully paid off until 1947.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe ruinous state of the country Pierce describes in his next section on Haiti after the revolution was mostly damage done during the revolution and the subsequent attempts by France to retake control of the colony, not an inability to maintain buildings. And despite what Pierce would have you think, the Haitians built many new structures for their nation, despite their economic woes. These include the Citadelle Laferriere and the Sans-Souci Palace which were built by King Henri Christophe. It’s also very strange for Pierce to describe the governments of Haiti’s many autocrats as African, as the early rulers of Haiti sought to emulate European rulership while later dictators would be more similar to Latin American dictators rather than those in Africa.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter skipping over the rest of Haiti’s history in the 19th century, Pierce describes the American occupation of Haiti, saying that it was done to “force a semblance of order on the country” and protect American business interests. This isn’t really true as the United States invaded Haiti in order to protect the American control over the Haitian Banque Nationale from being threatened by French and particularly German interests and thus protect the American government’s influence on the Haitian government. The United States also sought to ensure that the Haitian government would not sell their naval base at Mole-Saint-Nicolas to any European powers as they felt it would interfere with American control over the Windward passage that the United States was maintaining through their control of Guantanamo Bay. Restoring order to Haiti was entirely coincidental to the United States greater goal of ensuring American hegemony over the Caribbean. As for the business interests, while the investments of American businesses in Haiti did amount to about 4 million dollars worth in 1915 this was easily one of the countries that American businesses had invested the least into (compare the 4 million dollars invested in Haiti to the 800 million dollars invested in Mexico and the over 200 million invested in Costa Rica) as the attempts of American businesses to make money through Haitian investments turned out to be failures more often than not.\n \nPierce also mentions that the Marines built paved roads, which isn’t really true. Firstly it’s incredibly dishonest to say that the Marines provided Haiti with paved roads because out of the 1075 miles of road built in Haiti during the occupation only 5 miles of it was paved. Secondly, the Marines didn’t build the roads, they oversaw the construction of the roads by Haitian peasants who were forced to work on the construction of the road network due to the Marines reviving an old French law regarding feudal obligations of the peasantry. The system saw frequent abuses to the Haitian laborers by the American Marines. This sort of forced labor in service of foreign Whites was incredibly unpopular to a population that had been enslaved only a few generations ago and led to large uprisings against the American occupation led by Charlemagne Peralte.\n\nAnd based on Pierce’s description of the American intervention you’d almost think it was a humanitarian mission, which it certainly was not. The United States absolutely abused its position of power to further its own interests at the expense on the Haitian national interest. For example, when the Haitian legislature refused to become the American military’s puppet the legislature was dissolved. Following this, the Americans made a new constitution for Haiti and rigged an election to ensure that the new pro-American constitution passed in a popular vote (a vote in which 5% of a country with a 97% illiteracy rate voted). It also established the Gendarmerie (a military designed to maintain internal security which was led by the American Marines), which was used to maintain order and assisted the Marines in beginning a reign of terror in interior of the country. This included the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of haitian prisoners, the imprisoning of journalists who spoke out against the occupation, the gunning down of protesters, and in some parts of the country the summary execution of any Haitian suspected of being a rebel.\n\nPierce goes on to say that the American troops “gave the Haitians the basis for a fresh start”, which is a dishonest statement at best. The Americans left improvements to the island with no thought put to how it would function after they left. Education during the occupation was focused on manual and technical training, with little focus placed on combating the nation’s illiteracy problem. The Marines also failed to adequately prepare Haitians to take over the roles that they had been filling during the occupation. Prior to 1930 the Marines had been operating under the assumption that the occupation would be indefinite and by the time they began the Haitianization process of these services a combination of poor communication, lack of time, and general foot-dragging worked to make it so that Haitians weren’t prepared to take over most of the maintenance duties for the communication services, hospitals, and roads (the roads in particular were difficult to maintain due to being unpaved) after the Marines withdrew. This was all made worse by the dire financial situation that Haiti had continually been in since independence which had worsened during the occupation when the American-controlled puppet-government’s policy had been to retire Haitian debt to American bondholders in advance of contract requirements. This made it difficult for Haiti to gain surplus revenues which may have been used for development. Haiti’s record of debt payment also failed to create a higher credit standing for Haiti and it remained difficult for the nation to secure favorable loan terms. Though on a separate topic, Pierce also says that the Haitians returned to Vodou after the Marines left, which is just untrue as vodou never stopped being part of Haitian beliefs due to the occupation. They couldn’t return to it because they had never left it. It is also worthwhile to note that not every improvement the Americans had left in Haiti disappeared as several of the hospitals and roads built during the occupation remain functional to this day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFollowing this Pierce discusses the Marines’ return to Haiti in 1958, which he also gets incorrect. First off, the Marines were not sent into Haiti to “rebuild the country’s economy and infrastructure” as Pierce claims, they were sent in to reinforce the position of Haitian president Francois Duvalier after he had taken power and establish a permanent military mission on Haiti. They didn’t rebuild anything as Pierce claims and even though they did train the Haitian army it still remained in a period of continual decline. This wasn’t really the Marines’ fault though as Duvalier repeatedly purged the armed forces to ensure their absolute loyalty to him. Though amazingly, Pierce manages to not say anything objectively false about the 1994 American intervention in Haiti, mostly due to him barely mentioning it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPierce then gets into some real racist shit, most of which I’ll just ignore simply because it’s not really history so there’s nothing worth debunking. However I will say that the criticisms Pierce has of how Africans “always have done things; with... vodou” this is just wrong as vodou isn’t really from Africa, it was developed in the Caribbean as an amalgamation between many differing beliefs held by the African slaves transported to the New World and was often mixed with the Catholicism that Haitians had learned from the French. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPierce then reads from a book written by Hesketh Prichard entitled Where Black Rules White: A Journey Across and About Haiti in which Prichard details his 1899 voyage to Haiti. This book isn’t really a good one to use as a basis for any understanding of Haiti at the turn of the century. Prichard knew very little about Haiti before arriving in the nation and much of what he did learn about Haiti while travelling the countryside was tainted by his own racial prejudices and much of the information in Prichard’s book is flat-out incorrect. A prime example of this would be the quote used by Pierce in the video in which he describes how Haitians who had no White ancestry were seen as better than the Haitian mulattoes. This is entirely false as for most of Haiti’s history, and particularly when Prichard visited at the turn of the century, mulattoes were the societal elite and made up the majority of Haiti’s upper class.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter quoting Prichard, Pierce finally devotes a section of the video to vodou after using it as a vague boogeyman for the entire video. Unsurprisingly he gets it almost completely wrong. While Pierce does correctly identify that Roman Catholicism is the most common religion in Haiti, he fails to grasp that Haitian Roman Catholicism is heavily influenced by vodou practices. Pierce then says that vodou is based on snake worship, which is not correct. One of the primary figures in vodou is the spirit Damballa whose symbol is a snake, but there are many important spirits in vodou who have nothing to do with snakes so defining the entire religion as snake worship is pretty disingenuous.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor the rest of the video Pierce either goes on about racist stuff or repeats the same falsehoods he stated earlier in the video so there’s no point in debunking them again. However before closing this I’d like to touch on one important aspect of Pierce’s video which is a particularly malicious form of bad history; his narrative. The narrative of Haitian history in Pierce’s video is one of a nation given every opportunity to succeed, and the population’s inherent flaws interfering with that success. This narrative is not only racist, as it pins all the problems Haiti has faced simply on the fact that the population is Black, but also ignores the context surrounding every event in Haitian history in order to arrive at the incorrect conclusion that Haitian history is a history of failure. In a world where knowledge of Haitian history is uncommon at best I find the dissemination of such a malicious narrative disgusting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd with that I am finished. Pierce’s video was such a strange amalgamation of racism and ignorance that honestly took a lot more research to thoroughly debunk than I originally had anticipated. But luckily I feel like I learned a ton of new information about Haitian history through researching and writing this post, and I certainly hope that you all learned some new things about Haitian history by reading it. I know this post was really long so I thank you all who put in the time to read it, and I hope that you all have a wonderful day! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSources\n\n-Garrigus, John D..

        "text": "A recent post on /r/badphilosophy reminded me of the [Slate Star Codex review of *Albion's Seed*](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/27/book-review-albions-seed/). This is one of the most popular posts ever on SSC and is frequently reposted and quoted. I even shared it on my Facebook wall at some point.\n\nUnfortunately it is also /r/badhistory, and in this post I will prove why. (*edit:* This is not a complete rejection of Albion's Seed, see the full post below and comments)\n\nA Reddit search confirms for me that *Albion's Seed* is still taught in universities. It's a book with some fun elements, especially about the Puritans of New England and the Cavaliers who formed the origins of slaveholding Southern society. The author, David Fischer, pushes the idea that English immigrants self-sorted into different cultural communities.\n\nHowever, when I read the book for myself and started looking at the footnotes, I discovered some interesting difficulties. Much of the Puritan section is based on a small selection of 19th century reminisces, rather than contemporary sources. There are various little bits of folk etymology and urban legend here and there.\n\nIn the Puritan and Cavalier sections this isn't all that bad, but the Quaker section is a bit dubious, and the Appalachian section betrays a rather dark undercurrent, which was recognized by academics when the book was first published.\n\nSpecifically, part of the mission of *Albion's Seed* is to revive the \"Teutonic germ theory\" of pre-WW2 historiography, which states that America achieved  power and liberty based on unique English cultural achievements, rather than geographic or social advantages (for example, slavery).\n\nThe place in which we may see Fischer reviving the Teutonic germ myth is chiefly in the section on \"Borderers\". Fischer's book is called *Albion's Seed* for a reason: he wishes to reinforce that America's ruling class came not from various peoples from the British Isles, or Europe, or other parts of the world, but specifically from the *English* first and foremost. Some of the early colonists of the rural South and Appalachia were not English -- they are often called Scots-Irish -- so they serve as his chief *counterexample* and *outgroup*. He calls the Appalachian settlers \"Borderers\" regardless of their actual place of origin. One of Fischer's sources claims that \"the whole of Scotland can be considered a Border region\" of England, ignoring Scotland's centrality to the development of liberalism, science, and nationalism.\n\nFischer creates a Frankenstein's monster of \"Borderers\" out of bits and pieces of anecdote of specific events from the 18th to 20th centuries, mostly getting his methodology and analysis directly from pre-1920 sources, and ignoring most research contemporary to his own publication. **His section on \"Borderers\" is meant to create an image of a race of uncivilized whites who are *habitually* violent, chaotic, stupid, and *resist* attempts by others to \"civilize\" them, when in fact the Scots-Irish often sought integration, while rural, poor Appalachianers were more often the *victims* of violence from these supposedly civilized groups.** While *Albion's Seed* was initially hailed in popular and academic reviews, when people looked closer as I did, they began to see that the \"Borderers\" section is one big fib.\n\nHere's how academics responded to Fischer at the time (“Culture Wars: David Hackett Fischer's *Albion's Seed*.” *Appalachian Journal*, vol. 19, no. 2, 1992, pp. 161–200):\n\n&gt; **Edward J. Cowan**: \"It is just not acceptable to pretend that areas as diverse as the Gaelic-speaking Highlands, Ireland, Lowland Scotland, the border country and the north of England shared some kind of cultural homogeneity. ... he presents the equivalent of a potted history of the United States in which he might highlight only presidential assassinations and the crime figures from New York.\"\n\n&gt; **Rodger Cunningham**: \"[I]t was primarily a matter of violence done *to* the ancestors of Appalachians and not, as it naturally appeared from the other side, one of violence being perpetrated *by* them. And of course this has continued for eight centuries in the same terms ... the omission of these facts has serious consequences for Fischer's concept of 'violence' ...\"\n\nFor reasons of space I will not quote the entire argument made by **Altina Waller** in her talk, but she very persuasively argues that social position (what would be called \"class\" in the 19th century) was more important than geographic heritage in determining cultural mores, and makes the supposedly huge distinctions between these four groups of Britishers quite dubious compared to their commonalities. She expresses some sympathy for Fischer's attempted project but sharply rejects his concept of \"Borderers.\"\n\nFischer was given space for a reply to these critiques. He chose to conflate the scholars he was responding to with anonymous threats sent to him by mail, and characterized his critics as aged hippies who hadn't gotten over the Vietnam War and couldn't see that the Puritan/Quaker/Cavalier gift of freedom was now blossoming throughout the world of 1992 (by \"the world\", one might stress, he means [the former Soviet Union](http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/12/05/confidence-in-democracy-and-capitalism-wanes-in-former-soviet-union/), and by \"freedom\" he means some very structural thing the \"Borderers\" were never able to provide, but had to have supplied to them). Here's a direct quote from him:\n\n&gt; With the spectacular rebirth of freedom around the world and the decline of the nuclear danger, many of my younger students are returning to the classical problems of American history with a more optimistic and even whiggish teleology that sees history as a process of progressive change.\n\nThe following issue of this journal contains an article by Michael Ellis, \"On the Use of Dialect as Evidence: \"Albion's Seed\" in Appalachia,\" which presents a greater amount of damning detail, as follows:\n\n&gt; How Fischer arrived at his generalization [about the existence of a \"family of dialects\" called \"Appalachian\"] based on [his cited] sources is confusing ... the manner in which Fischer arrives at this conclusion is questionable.\n\n&gt; [M]ore disturbing are instances where Fischer misrepresents a source in order to imply an empirical basis for a subjective generalization. For example, Fischer claims that:\n\n&gt; *This was an earthy dialect. The taboos of Puritan English had little impact on Southern highland speech until the twentieth century. Sexual processes and natural functions were freely used in figurative expressions. Small children, for example, were fondly called little shits\" as a term of endearment. A backcountry granny would say kindly to a little child, \"Ain't you a cute little shit.\" (p. 653)*\n\n&gt; [But Fischer's cited source] goes on to argue that in regards to sexual teminology, the mountain folk were considerably more inhibited, employing, for example, various euphemisms to avoid the words *bull* and *stallion*. Fischer, however, ignores this information since it does not support his assertion that \"Sexual talk was free and easy in the backcountry\" (p. 680). \n\nFurthermore, Fischer was not simply skimming his source; he was actively discarding counterevidence. For the more eye-popping parts of his entertaining Puritan section, many of which are quoted in the SSC blog post, Fischer relies heavily on a very interesting book, *Oldtown Folks* by Harriet Beecher Stowe (yes, that Harriet Beecher Stowe). However, if you pick up this book for yourself -- and I recommend that you do -- you will find that it portrays a vibrant \"common folk\" in New England who more closely resemble Fischer's uninhibited, taboo-free \"backcountry\" than they do his stuffy, moralistic Puritans. Fischer threw out a whole lot of fun stuff from *his own principal source* in order to (1) resurrect our beloved Cotton Mather stereotype from the depths of the 19th century and (2) create a fictitious group of \"Borderers\" who were so culturally backwards they impeded the march of progress initiated by \"the Puritans.\"\n\nIn *Albion's Seed*, Fischer's anti-Appalachian rhetoric is presented in the refined manner of a well-read historian, but the SSC post brings Fischer's prejudices out into the open in a rather uncomfortable way. Poor Scott Alexander was simply reading a well-regarded book probably recommended to him by someone smart, and he is astonished by what happens as he draws each of Fischer's pigheaded generalizations to a clickbaity conclusion. Here, at last, is the bad history from Slate Star Codex:\n\n&gt; **So the Borderers all went to Appalachia and established their own little rural clans there and nothing at all went wrong except for the entire rest of American history.**\n\nThis is precisely what Fischer wanted his readers to believe, and Scott falls for it.\n\n&gt; **Colonial opinion on the Borderers differed within a very narrow range: one Pennsylvanian writer called them “the scum of two nations”, another Anglican clergyman called them “the scum of the universe”.**\n\nScott again takes Fischer's bait and repeats propaganda used to *justify violence* against the rural poor, as if it represents a neutral judgment made by well-informed observers on the ground. Fischer probably presented this material mostly humorously, but for Scott it has become more serious.\n\n&gt; **Borderer town-naming policy was very different from the Biblical names of the Puritans or the Ye Olde English names of the Virginians. Early Borderer settlements include – just to stick to the creek-related ones – Lousy Creek, Naked Creek, Shitbritches Creek, Cuckold’s Creek, Bloodrun Creek, Pinchgut Creek, Whipping Creek, and Hangover Creek. There were also Whiskey Springs, Hell’s Half Acre, Scream Ridge, Scuffletown, and Grabtown. The overall aesthetic honestly sounds a bit Orcish.**\n\nAnyone who has been to England knows that names like this are [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickle_Cock_Bridge) throughout [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gropecunt_Lane), not just in a mythical \"border\" region. Fischer has lumped together these placenames into the Borderers section for no reason at all, and Scott follows the logic to the *intended* conclusion that these \"Borderers\" were \"a bit Orcish.\"\n\n&gt; **This is not to paint the Borderers as universally poor and dumb – like every group, they had an elite, and some of their elite went on to become some of America’s most important historical figures. Andrew Jackson became the first Borderer president, behaving *exactly* as you would expect the first Borderer president to behave**\n\nOnce again, socioeconomic position transmigrates into ethnic, even racial deficits because of Fischer's massive stereotyping.\n\n&gt; **The [Borderer] conception of liberty has also survived and shaped modern American politics: it seems essentially to be the modern libertarian/Republican version of freedom from government interference, especially if phrased as “get the hell off my land”, and *especially* especially if phrased that way through clenched teeth while pointing a shotgun at the offending party.**\n\nAgain, as we have seen above, this is the *exact* conclusion that Fischer intended his readers to draw, based on his own political beliefs.\n\nAlthough I have not read either, a better reviewed book on colonial backwoods life is Jordan and Kaups, *The American Backwoods Frontier: An Ethical and Ecological Interpretation* (1992), and a better one the Scotch-Irish in North America is Blethen and Wood, *Ulster and North America: Transatlantic Perspectives on the Scotch Irish* (2001). Some of the major differences between these books and *Albion's Seed* include the presence of other, non-British immigrants in the backwoods, and the surprising success of many Scotch Irish at integrating with the \"English\" coastal elites of America. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lack of lengthy reviews of these books from extremely online people, so I'll have to find them myself.\n\nIn conclusion, don't trust everything you read on the Internet, even if the cited source is a widely read and well-reviewed book. Thank you and goodnight!",

Not only does the tweeter lack sufficient evidence, eg. letters but also concludes that close relationships and nervous breakdowns are equivalent to homosexual tendacies.\n\nOn the other hand, such letters do exist and contain \"romantic\" vibes; however some sentences are largely exaggerated, such as:\n\n&gt;*'...the reasons I should not marry will probably last as long as my life'*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*'I could wish sir to live all my life, or the greatest part of it, with you.'*\n\n[Reference for source](https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A72024905)\n\nThis is not to say it is impossible for Newton to be homosexual, but such claims cannot be accounted for certain, especially from a historical perspective. Even [*The Newton Project*](http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/his-personal-life) have mentions of this relationship and the probability of Newton being homosexual but doesn't consider it a historical fact we know for sure.\n\nIn addition, Newton dying a virgin also isn't a 100&amp;#37; \"we know for sure\" history. Most of it came from Voltaire, actually, the very same man who popularised the \"apple story.\" Other evidence for this theory would be Newton's own choice of a celibate lifestyle and his own proclamation on his deathbed \\-\\- you can say he lied, but you can't verify the truthfulness.\n\ntl;dr it is subjective to claim the sexuality of a historical figure from just a few passages and the supposed behaviour used as evidence of said historical figure does very little to support the claim of his sexuality.\n\nEDIT: Also Newton had a mental breakdown when his mother died and is thought to have ingested mercury at some point. Even if Newton did have a mental breakdown because of Fatio, you can also claim he had an Oedipus complex based on that logic.",

        "text": "Was rereading some (Canadian) constitutional law material, specifically R v Keegstra, for a research paper. I was going over Justice (at that time) McLachlin's dissent, and noticed the above quote. To be fair she was summing up Frederick Schauer's (*Free Speech: A Philosophical Enquiry (1982)*) points. The full quote with the sentence before and after is ([quick link to Lexum](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/695/index.do)):\n\n&gt;Arguments based on intrinsic value and practical consequences are married in the thought of F. Schauer (Free Speech: A Philosophical Enquiry (1982)). Rather than evaluating expression to see why it might be worthy of protection, Schauer evaluates the reasons why a government might attempt to limit expression. Schauer points out that throughout history, attempts to restrict expression have accounted for a disproportionate share of governmental blunders -- ***from the condemnation of Galileo for suggesting the earth is round*** to the suppression as \"obscene\" of many great works of art.   Professor Schauer explains this peculiar inability of censoring governments to avoid mistakes by the fact that, in limiting expression, governments often act as judge in their own cause. \n\nThe alleged badhistory is that Galileo was persecuted for the claim that the earth was round. Galileo's persecution had nothing to do with this, this claim was in fact not controversial. This myth is similar to the claim that Christopher Columbus sailed to the Americas to prove that the earth was round. The claim that the earth was round was widely accepted by most learned people (and I would think quite a few builders and sailors knew of this too). The following are supposed to excerpts from the inquisitorial proceedings, translated by a person who is supposed to be a historian known for his works on Galileo, that seem to disprove this myth.\n\nMaurice Finocchiaro, a historian of science (?), has translations of the inquisitorial proceedings on [this site](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#sentence). The relevant quotes being: \n\n&gt;Whereas you, Galileo, son of the late Vincenzio Galilei, Florentine, aged seventy years, were denounced to this Holy Office in 1615 ***for holding as true the false doctrine taught by some that the sun is the center of the world*** \n\nand\n\n&gt;***That the sun is the center of the world*** and motionless is a proposition which is philosophically absurd and false, and formally heretical, for being explicitly contrary to Holy Scripture; \n\nand \n\n&gt;We say, pronounce, sentence, and declare that you, the above-mentioned Galileo, because of the things deduced in the trial and confessed by you as above, have rendered yourself according to this Holy Office vehemently suspected of heresy, namely of having held and believed a doctrine which is false and contrary to the divine and Holy Scripture: ***that the sun is the center of the world*** and does not move from east to west, and the earth moves and is not the center of the world\n\nI know there's some stuff concerning specific stuff about the issue possibly being about the actual metaphysics surrounding the matter and stuff, but idk about any of that. All I know is that it doesn't have to do with the earth being round and is somehow related to professed heliocentrism.",

Big Think transcribes the vid: \n\n&gt;Question: Who's the greatest physicist in history?\n\n&gt;DeGrasse Tyson:    Isaac Newton.  I mean, just look... You read his writings.  Hair stands up... I don't have hair there but if I did, it would stand up on the back of my neck.  You read his writings, the man was connected to the universe in ways that I never seen another human being connected.  It's kind of spooky actually.  He discovers the laws of optics, figured out that white light is composed of colors.  That's kind of freaky right there.  You take your colors of the rainbow, put them back together, you have white light again.  That freaked out the artist of the day.  How does that work?  Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet gives you white.  The laws of optics.  He discovers the laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation.  Then, a friend of his says, \"Well, why do these orbits of the planets... Why are they in a shape of an ellipse, sort of flattened circle?  Why aren't... some other shape?\"  He said, you know, \"I can't... I don't know.  I'll get back to you.\"  So he goes... goes home, comes back couple of months later, \"Here's why.  They're actually conic sections, sections of a cone that you cut.\"  And... And he said, \"Well, how did find this out?  How did you determine this?\"  \"Well, I had to invent integral and differential calculus to determine this.\"  Then, he turned 26.  Then, he turned 26.  We got people slogging through calculus in college just to learn what it is that Isaac Newtown invented on a dare, practically.  So that's my man, Isaac Newton. \n\nThony Christie [did a nice job of disemboweling Tyson](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2017/06/14/why-doesnt-he-just-shut-up/)\n\nRegarding the question about elliptical orbits. [Edmond Halley presented the question to Newton in 1684](http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath658/kmath658.htm). Newton was born in December of 1642. By my arithmetic Newton was 41 at that time.\n\nSo the bit about Newton inventing calculus on dare from Edmond Halley before he was 26 is obviously a fiction.\n\nBut did Newton invent calculus in two months before he was 26? Thony Christie also looks at this claim in [The Wrong Question](http://guestblog.scientopia.org/2011/03/05/ich-bin-ein-gastblogger-ii-the-wrong-question/). I agree with Christie that inventing integral and difference wasn't the invention of a single person. Rather it was the collaborative effort of many people over many years.\n\n[Eudoxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus#Mathematics) was making progressively more accurate approximations by slicing stuff into smaller bits. Two thousand years before Newton. \n\nIn my opinion the ground breaking invention that Newton built on was analytical geometry. In other words, graph paper with an x and y axis. With this invention curves can be described with algebraic expressions.\n\ny=x^2 makes a parabola.  \nx^2 + y^2 = 1 is a circle of radius 1.\n\n[Analytical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#Western_Europe) was invented in the generation before Newton by Fermat and Descartes. \n\nGiven this tool, it was only a matter of time before someone used Eudoxus like methods to determine slope of a curve at a point. Which was done by Fermat. See [History of the Differential from the 17th Century](http://www.math.wpi.edu/IQP/BVCalcHist/calc2.html) and scroll to *2.3 Fermat's Maxima and Tangent*. Again, this is the generation before Newton.\n\nHow about Integral Calculus or finding the area under a curve? [Also done in the generation before Newton by Cavalieri](http://www.math.wpi.edu/IQP/BVCalcHist/calc1.html).\n\n[Cavalieri's quadrature formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalieri%27s_quadrature_formula):\nIntegral from 0 to a of x^n dx = 1/(n+1) a^(n+1)\n\nSo we can see the foundations for both integral and differential calculus were laid well before Newton came on the scene. So where does the claim that Newton and/or Leibniz invented calculus come from? Some speculate they were the first to notice that the integral is the anti-derivative. But even this is wrong. \n\nFrom Thony Christie's [The Wrong Question](http://guestblog.scientopia.org/2011/03/05/ich-bin-ein-gastblogger-ii-the-wrong-question/)\n\n&gt;I hope I have said enough to make it clear that there was an awful lot of calculus around before Newton and Leibniz even considered the subject, so what did they do? It is often claimed that their major contribution was the discovery of the fundamental theorem of the calculus, i.e. that integration and differentiation are inverse operations but even this is not true. The theorem first appears in an implied form in the work of James Gregory and more explicitly in that of Isaac Barrow both of which are explicitly cited by both Leibniz and Newton in their own work.\n\nI made [a timeline graphic](http://hopsblog-hop.blogspot.com/2016/01/fact-checking-neil-degrasse-tyson.html#Newton) on [Fact Checking Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://hopsblog-hop.blogspot.com/2016/01/fact-checking-neil-degrasse-tyson.html). Like many of Tyson's entertaining stories, the Newton anecdotes are a product of Tyson's poor memory and vivid imagination.",
