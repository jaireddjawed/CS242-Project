        "text": "Hi everyone, I'll be starting medical school (accepted) this fall, and wanted advice from actual medical students, so I hope it's okay to post here. I just want to get a better understanding of how much this really matters in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI received an email that a basic science project I worked on was just submitted for publication. I left this lab this past fall, but I'm still on good terms with my PI, who's the corresponding author. They wrote me a rec for med school and everything and I would consider us friends. Now, for the paper that was submitted, I spent about 2 years on this project and put in hundreds of hours. I was pretty disappointed to see that another intern who started the project with me but left the lab after 6 months and contributed way less was given second author over me.\n\nLike I mentioned, the manuscript has already been submitted. Is there even anything I can do about it? If yes, is it worth talking to my past PI and potentially souring a good relationship? I'm not doing any more work with the lab so I don't expect any other publications, but still. I appreciate any input - pls be nice I'm just disappointed/confused.",

        "text": "MS-1: I had three gap years before medical school where I taught high school and traveled. Additionally, I majored in English in college and finished my pre-med requirements by junior year. Needless to say, I had not studied science in four years when I started medical school. I was terrified for the first test. My roommate was a biochemistry major straight out of undergrad, and I thought there was no way for me to compete. The icing on the cake was during our orientation, administration told us there would be “more than a handful” of us that would fail the first exam. So, I studied like crazy for the first test. I was a monster for the first three weeks, going over the same powerpoints ad nauseam. I ended up getting a 97 on the first test, I think I was third in the class. After that I calmed down a bit, but I still was very insecure about my academic abilities until after the 1st block. Then of course, right when my confidence was getting solid, COVID hit. I moved back home to study, as in person class and tests were put on an indefinite hiatus. At first I didn’t mind the solitude. Getting away from my class was oddly peaceful at first. But as MS-1 summer came to a close, I started to grow restless of the monotony.\n\nMS-2: Purgatory. That’s the best word for second year. It felt like I was studying for an eternity. There was some joy in the process, but primarily monotony. It’s funny, I look back on this year and I don’t remember much. I was living at home, I didn’t see anyone from my school. I was isolated, obviously, we all probably were during the peak of 2020. Study. Uworld. Repeat. Once I saw an owl while studying–that’s the only core memory I take from this year. The night before Step 1 I slept horribly. I had bruxism, maybe slept 1 hour that night. I showed up and scored a bit below my predictors, but I got it over with. \n\nMS-3: Ups and downs. Finally in the hospital, I got much more social stimulation. But also, with that came public humiliation, rude attendings, busy residents, and always being in the way. I always assumed medical students were “important”, we are the future of medicine in a way. But I almost never felt important as a medical student. I often felt like a burden, a nuisance, a liability. Being an MS-3 makes even the most component people feel incompetent. There were moments of satisfaction–finally able to be involved in patient care at some level. However, even the small victories were not enough to necessarily make it all “worth it”, but a small fix that kept me going in the right direction.\n\nMS-4: The foot is off the gas pedal and I’m coasting. This is it. Is this the Ithaca, the golden year, the paradise that I was promised? No, not for me anyway. There is still match stress, some obligations, my debt, and social isolation to worry about. However, I am generally at some peace. I’m more competent in the hospital–at the very least less vulnerable to a bad evaluation. Tests are history, which is a huge relief. I’m finally knocking at the door to residency. But am I truly happy? I don’t think so. Happiness is a strange bird, it comes and goes and flies circles above me. Sometimes it perches on my shoulder, other times it leaves me be. I don’t know what to say really, other than I’m glad it’s almost over. I sincerely wish the next chapter of my life is an improvement, and I truly believe it will be. Overall, I’m fortunate that I went to medical school, but it was certainly more troublesome and less satisfying than I ever imagined. Good luck to the MS-4s matching, the MS-3s in the thick of rotations, the MS-2s struggling with STEP, and the MS-1s just trying to get through the year. It is a hell of a ride.",

Love the mission of psychiatry as a speciality \n-Have always been the type of person drawn to quirky people and love psychoanalyzing people \n-Find psychosis and mania fascinating\n-Love the easygoing nature of psychiatrists \n-Good lifestyle in residency and as an attending is appealing bc I want to travel and have a social life \n\nPsych cons:\n-Frustrated by limited treatment options, basically antidepressants and antipsychotics \n-Don’t love personality disorders and cluster B \n-Kind of superficial but I don’t like how people don’t consider psychiatrists real doctors. And I don’t like how the lay public doesn’t know the difference between psychologists and psychiatrists \n\nNeuro pros:\n-Love how cerebral and complex it is. I’m engaged during all of rounds because of everything is a huge puzzle. \n-Like the idea of being considered a “real doctor” compared to psych \n-Like working with different doctors like radiologists, neurosurgeons etc\n-Find headache, seizures, and movement disorders very interesting \n-Patients are very grateful for their neurologists. \n\nNeuro cons:\n-The diseases are so so so sad. Stroke, Parkinson’s, ALS, etc are so rough and the diagnosis changes a persons life. I like being there to help but it’s a bummer to face their incurable diseases every day. \n-I hate ICU or any critical care. I don’t like my patients to be sedated or brain dead. I also have no interest in brain bleeds or TBI. \n-The material is harder and I would have a tougher time learning it all.\n\nProbably an average applicant. Income really isn’t a concern for me.

For starters, a significant portion of our lectures are not taught by PhD or practicing MD/DOs. Many of the lecturers are taught by nurse practitioners, master’s degree holders (not pursuing PhD), physical therapists, and even optometrists.\n\nMoreover, during second year our school requires us to spend time in a student run clinic. However, one of our “preceptors” is blatantly anti-vax and actively discourages students from asking patients their vaccination status. She recently told a few students that vaccines in general are “more harm than good”. The administration was previously notified, yet no action has been taken. \n\nObviously, the faculty situation at my school is pretty discouraging. Is there anyone else in a similar situation? I am most concerned about the preceptor that is outwardly anti-vax.",

My partner works from home and would be the primary caregiver to little one.\n\nProgram A:\n\n-3 hours from home so my partner’s parents would most likely move with us, thus decreasing the load on my partner and potentially saving us childcare $$ \n-class size of 13\n-adopted new 2+2 schedule where 2 weeks of every month you work in clinic- however the other two weeks can be spotty. If on inpatient, can work 7-8 days straight, get one day off, then have 4 days of clinic before your next weekend off. \n-was told by PD I’d get at least 6 days off per 28 day block\n-heard some shady things about fellow residents and how not many of them get along, it isn’t very friendly \n-hard to get OB delivery requirements met \n-have to drive 1 hr one way for a few blocks\n-no food stipend!! \n-no call except PGY2 and PGY3 years on one block only\n-4 weeks of nights total with the 2+2 schedule; as an intern can be alone on nights \n-cost of living is superb\n-majority of spots last year were taken by SOAP candidates \n\nProgram B:\n-15 hr drive from home so we’d be alone and my partner would have to shoulder majority of childcare, or we would have to spend $ on daycare \n-people and culture are phenomenal, only heard good things and felt good vibes \n-food stipend included\n-sick days unused roll over \n-class size of 8\n-traditional schedule, no nights till PGY2\n-higher salary but higher COL\n-no long commute or away blocks\n\nWhat would you choose? Basically I love the people of program B but program A is closer to family. Also concerned about childcare $$.",

He didn’t seem to care about my lessons, and he ignored it and asked me what medications the patient was on. Of course, it wasn’t my patient and I just got there, so I couldn’t be expected to know that. Anyways, how can med students be about to match and go to residency and haven’t touched a patient? Is this common?",
