        "text": "I truly apologise for anyone unfortunate enough to stumble upon this post, and reading it. \n\nI messed around with things that are best left untouched. I mocked the devil himself and now he's going to kill me. \n\nIt all started when my friend brought over that cursed board to my home. \n\nI was fresh out of a relationship, hurting, upset. Lily wanted to cheer me up, so she brought over a ouija board, which she thought to be a silly game. I am a believer of the occult, so I really didn't want to play, I really didn't want to invite anyone or anything into my home. But she convinced me. So we did, the two of us. \n\nI fetched a couple dollar candles from my attic, lit them up. We turned off all the lights, placed the board on my coffee table, and began playing. \n\n\"If there are any spirits that would like to contact us, please move the planchet to yes.\" Lily said while moving the planchet in a circular clockwise motion on the board. Once she stopped moving it, the planchet began to move towards yes. I got the chills.\n\n\"Are you sure it's fine to play this game?\" I asked her, feeling less confident each minute.\n\n\"Yes, of course, cmon, have some fun!.\" I noticed the planchet moving again, even though we didn't ask any question. It moved to F, then U, then N. \"Fun.\" Lily said. \n\n\"What does that mean?\" Lily asked. The planchet didn't move. \n\nShe shrugged and asked another question. \"What's your name?\" The planchet moved to Z, then O, and I held my breath, fearing the worst, but instead of moving back to Z, the planchet moved to E, and then stopped, I took a deep breath. Lily gave me a weird look, then asked again. \"How old are you?\"\n\nThe planchet moved to 1, then 9. \"19.\" I said under my breath.\n\n\"How did you pass?\" This time I asked the question, getting into it the game a little more.\n\nThe planchet didn't move. \"It seems like she won't answer questions she doesn't like.\" Lily said, and then spoke to the board. \"Did you live in this house?\" The planchet moved to yes. \n\n\"When?\" I asked. It moved to 1, then 9, then 7, then 2. \"1972.\" Lily said thoughtfully. \n\nWe continued on asking generic questions and getting generic answers, when we asked things more personal, things about her death, she'd not answer. Eventually we decided it was time to end the game and said goodbye. \n\nAfter Lily left I was still left curious on the previous residents of my house. So I googled it, I googled about my house, about Zoe, about 1972, but my county was large, and many things happened in 1972, so it was almost impossible to narrow it down. I also couldn't find anyone by the name of Zoe. I know spirits lie, so I assumed whoever we communicated with did so too.\n\nLily came over again the next day, and offered to continue the game, as reluctant as I was, I obliged and we set everything up again. We got into contact with Zoe again, this time however the whole thing seemed off. I was getting chills all over and felt really uneasy. I kept hearing creaks and various other house noises. At one point I even heard a loud bang, but Lily claimed she didn't. \n\nAfter we ran out of generic questions, we began asking about random things, like at one point Lily asked if Zoe can see or predict the future, to which Zoe responded with yes.\n\n\"Can you tell me then if I failed my math exam last week?\" She asked all giggly, excited about this new revalation. The planchet moved to yes. \"Okay, did I fail my math exam?\" Lily asked. The planchet moved to no, and Lily cheered, taking her hands off the planchet, my heart dropped. \"Lily!\" I screamed at her. \"Oops, please forgive me zoe.\" Lily quickly put her hands back on. \n\n\"Can you tell us the next lottery winning numbers to?\" Lily asked, still giddy with excitement, I however only felt worry. Something wasn't right. The candles were going crazy. The planchet moved to yes, but then began spelling out something. I W O N T T E L L Y O U, It finally finished spelling out after a long moment. Lily looked disappointed, but then asked something horrifying. \"When will I die?\" \"Lily!\" I warned her, but it was too late, the planchet began moving. It first moved to T, Then O, then M, it kept spelling until it finally finished the word. Tomorrow. The candles went crazy as the planchet stopped moving and went out. \"Goodbye Zoe.\" I said completely terrified, and forcefully moved the planchet through goodbye and took my hands off, relighting the candles. \n\n\"What the fuck Lily?\" I asked her, I was furious.\n\n\"Oh calm down, of course I won't die tomorrow.\" She said. \"Come on lets continue the game.\" Her voice sounded just a little bit off. She put her hands back on and invited the spirits again. Something answered. \"What's your name?\" Lily asked. I didn't have my hands on, she was playing alone. \"Lily! Stop!\" I shouted. The planchet moved to Z, then O. Then it repeated the sequence. I gasped. \"Say goodbye!\" I pleaded, Lily began giggling, the planchet kept moving back and forth between Z and O. \n\nThen it stopped, Lily looked at me, her eyes were watery, and she spoke in a voice that didn't sound like her's. \"When will August die?\" I watched in horror as the planchet moved to numbers. 01, 01, 2023. then it moved to the letters and spelled out eve. \n\nLily giggled once more and passed out on the spot. \"Lily!\" I screamed as I went to her side and tried to wake her, it didn't take long and she did wake up. She couldn't remember anything after she apologised for taking her hands off the planchet. I sent her home and warned her to never bring this accursed board back into my house. She kept asking what happened, but I said nothing.\n\nI got a call a day later that Lily's overpacked bus turned over as she was coming back from work, and she died. Just like the demon predicted.\n\nI'm going to die in under 48 hours. I don't know what to do, or how to prevent it. I'm tempted to play the game again and beg for mercy. The demon we contacted is the strongest of them all. If only I never agreed to play that stupid [game.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Coureherritt)",

        "text": "\n\n\n\nThis is a long one\nAnd I really hoped I had videos and photos my bad\n\n\nThis happend a few weeks ago I live in the Netherlands. There is this forest with a abandoned high school and it’s a school with 4 floors and the school is really long but I’ll just start. \n\n\n\nI was just chilling and I got a call from my friend if he wanted to go to that abandoned school and I said: no your crazy that’s haunted and scary and to deep into the woods we will get lost and it’s almost dark. But what got me to go is that some girls were coming and one of those girls was my crush so I said ok and I came to his house to meet.\n\n\n\n\n When I came to his house we went to the school. When we reached the woods it was already dark so we went back and got flashlights. Already I don’t think the half of the walk there we were lost. I said: I think we should go back it’s dark and scary let’s go. But they did not want to go and I was the funny kid of the group and I wanted to stay because my crush wanted to stay so we went walking again. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we got there we were looking for a place to enter the building but all the doors was locked and it is a school nobody went to the school ever because there was no window broken only thing was that the inside looked like it got bombed everything was destroyed and there was plants growing. We found a open window but we had to clime a little bit we got in and there was a big echo for everything if you dropped something you could hear it in the whole school. When we dropped in the school from the window it was so loud. We walked threw the school and talked a little we stopped at I think the principal room with 2 computers and a MacBook my friend put in his bag pack we played spin the Botle I got the chance to kiss my crush and we played truth or dare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n There was a silent because two girls had to kis each other but when they kissed we heard a hard bang it echoed through the whole building. We were all quiet. We heard steps from a couple people minimum 5 people. Than we heard people talking. I was kind of relieved. But also not because maybe we couldn’t be here. We were quite for like a whole 5 minutes looking at each other and there were still steps and talking going on my friend stood up and opened the door and looked outside. He saw nothing came back in and sat back on the chair and there was still talking and foot steps. It wasn’t that Loud so maybe they were far.\n\n\n\n\n\n But we thought about how did they come in since there was just one window open and if they broke a window we would have definitely heard it and same if they opened a door because the doors were loud and the front door and back door or any door was locked. So we were thinking what we should do if we should leave or hide. I don’t remember what they were saying because I was a little scared. There was one guy I didn’t really know he was a tough guy he was the strongest guy in our group we were with 5 girl and 3 boys. The tough guy wanted to go out and just fight them . I said: no ofc not that’s a dumb idea. Than we begun fighting because he pushed me. We were fighting for 1 minutes just punching eachother till he pushed me agains a closet that made a hard bang and after it was done. It was all quiet there was no one talking anymore or steps we begin to hide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The thing I remember as if it was yesterday. One of the guys said: what was that  maybe this is haunted or something. He said that in a deep old man voice I was hidden behind a big plant you could only see me if you looked good and had a good flash light so if they came and search here they couldn’t really find me. Well we were there for like a whole 10 to 20 minutes. Than everything went silent. So we took our chance. We went to the window so silent as possible when we were almost there we heard footsteps and really close.\n\n\n\n\n And I was in the back I looked back side every where my heart was in my throat going so fast. Those steps were so hard my breath going so fast everyone to was scared but the tough guy did something that changed everything. He shouted: Hey come at me what do you want. I shouted back: what the f*ck are you doing. And we looked as steps went faster I wanted to do something but was frozen and did not know what to do. I saw a long dude I think 6,8 6,9 and I was 5,9 and the tough one was 6,2. So to me he was long I looked from a far away he came running so fast but he ran from the way we needed to go.\n\n\n\n\n We ran the other way he was shouting so loud. It was so loud. Almost got deaf I looked back he was closer and getting closer but I was the fastest of my group I am a point guard at my basketball team and fullback at my football team. I am the fastest and second strongest I tried to run faster the halls came to a end and we had to make a turn but it ended when we made the turn it ended after a few steps. So there he was well he shouted at us he ran at me and the tough guy were taken by the neck and he seriously just took us picked us up as if we were nothing.\n\n\n\n\n He had a mask over his eyes and nose but his mouth and beard a long ass beard and he was strong stronger than the both of us and long. The tough one punched him in the face he could just hit him. And he let us fall and we ran. We ran to the window. We reached it and got out of the window and we ran into the woods. We found a path of grid and that means that we are close to our neighborhood but we heard something I really hoped I never heard. We heard behind us 3 black jeeps as if it was from like the fbi we ran into the woods and we found a road and then again the cars but the road was the road into our neighborhood. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe ran in the neighborhood over fences and and we came to my house we got in my house locked the doors and got snacks allot of water and went to my room and we were just chillin for 10 min and we heard cars. We turned off the song and led light and looked out the window and I swear they stopped infront of my house but I don’t know how they have found my house. We looked at them how they step out of their car look at some of the houses and from the look of it they were all so long just as long as the guy at the school that made me scared us scared but they just stepped in their vehicle and drove away and than we stayed up . \n\n\n\n\n\nall night for 2 days in my room so the whole weekend with the chips and drinks and a pee bottles and the girls just went to the bathrooms but not alone. Me and my crush now have a relationship because we spinner the botle some times when we were in my room. But now I’m still a little scarred to be close the woods and I wish I had photos and vids.",

        "text": " \n\nIt was a dark and stormy night when I first heard the whispers. I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, when I suddenly heard a faint voice in my ear. It was a soft, whispery voice that seemed to be coming from nowhere and everywhere at the same time. I tried to ignore it, but the voice kept getting louder and more insistent, until I couldn't ignore it any longer.\n\n\"Wake up,\" the voice whispered. \"Wake up and listen to me.\"\n\nI sat up in bed, my heart racing. I couldn't see anything in the darkness, but I could feel the presence of someone - or something - in the room with me.\n\n\"Who's there?\" I called out, my voice shaking.\n\nThere was no answer, but the whispers continued, growing louder and more urgent.\n\n\"You have to listen to me,\" the voice said. \"I have something important to tell you. Something you need to know.\"\n\nI was terrified, but I knew I had to face whatever was in the room with me. I slowly got out of bed and fumbled for the light switch. When the light came on, I saw that the room was empty. But the whispers continued, seeming to come from everywhere at once.\n\n\"What do you want from me?\" I yelled, feeling desperate.\n\n\"I need you to listen,\" the voice said. \"I need you to understand. You have to believe me.\"\n\nI don't know how long I stood there, listening to the voice and trying to understand what it was trying to tell me. The words were garbled and hard to make out, but I could sense the urgency and desperation in the voice.\n\nFinally, I couldn't take it anymore. I fell to my knees and covered my ears, trying to block out the voice.\n\n\"I can't listen anymore,\" I sobbed. \"Please, just leave me alone.\"\n\nBut the voice didn't stop. It just kept whispering, over and over, until I thought I would go crazy.\n\nIn that moment, I made a decision. I couldn't stay in that room anymore, not with the voice haunting me. I had to leave, no matter what.\n\nI gathered my things as quickly as I could and fled the house, not knowing where I was going or what I would do. All I knew was that I had to get as far away from the voice as possible.\n\nAs I ran through the streets, the voice followed me, whispering and begging me to listen. I didn't know if I would ever be able to escape it, but I had to try. I had to try and find some peace, some way to silence the whispers forever.\n\nAs the days passed, the whispers continued to haunt me, growing louder and more insistent with each passing hour. I tried everything I could think of to make them stop - I plugged my ears, I played loud music, I even tried sleeping with earplugs. But nothing seemed to work. The voice was always there, always whispering in my ear.\n\nI started to lose hope. I thought I would never be able to escape the voice, that it would follow me for the rest of my life. I started to withdraw from the world, unable to bear the thought of interacting with anyone else while the voice was constantly there, whispering in my ear.\n\nBut then, one day, something changed. The voice started to fade, growing softer and softer until it was barely there at all. I couldn't believe it - was it really over? Had I finally found a way to silence the whispers?\n\nI waited, holding my breath, but the voice didn't return. It was gone, and I was finally free.\n\nI don't know what happened or why the voice stopped. All I know is that I am grateful to be rid of it, and I will do everything I can to make sure it never comes back. The whispers may be gone, but the memory of them will stay with me forever.",

        "text": "This dude I live by, real nerdy kind of cat, chats me up sometimes about new tech and science articles he was reading and stuff. They were always interesting conversations, so I didn’t mind him hanging out. We ended up playing tabletop role playing games together with a couple of other people. It was pretty chill. Nothing too weird about it. Just dudes being guys being dudes, right? \n\nSo, when he texted me earlier tonight saying, “I’ve got a really cool idea, can you come help me out real quick?” I didn’t think much of it. I told him sure, what’s up? “You’ll see man, it’s pretty exciting!” This mother f\\*\\*ker man, exciting my a\\*\\*. I don’t know what the f\\*\\*k happend, but dude isn’t right anymore. I get here, and my guy is visibly excited. I’m feeling the energy, you know? So, I’m like cool. Dude starts talking way too fast about some sh\\*t he figured out. It’s like real specific a\\*\\* information too, like I don’t know what those numbers mean, bro. \n\nHe’s like, “oh, okay, so pretty much, I figured it out.” \n\nI’m like “bro, what did you figure out?”\n\nHe says mother f\\*\\*kin “interdimensional travel.” Like bro, shut the f\\*\\*k up. No you didn’t. \n\nHe says he’s for real and just needs me to help him set up and be “a witness to history.” He takes me into his basement, this dude’s got a pretty nice house, until here. This sh\\*t looks straight up like you took six or seven different basements and mashed them up to make this real frankenstein looking sh\\*t. On top of that, he’s got all sorts of sigils, a bunch of weirdly formatted numbers on the wall, hebrew words, and other things that look like words on. all of the walls. It's some straight up high level magick sh\\*t. There are weird computers and equipment on a fold out table. My mind immediately goes to f\\*\\*k, dude’s about to try to sacrifice my a\\*\\* in some red room type ish. \n\n“Hey man, what’s up with this sh\\*t?” Bro says, “which sh\\*t?” Like dog, “fu\\*\\*in all of it?” Dude says he needs the different materials at each of those angles so that’s why the basement is patchwork, the sigils are for directing the flow of energies and  preventing certain frequencies from getting in, and all of the electronic shit is for generating the specific change the energy needs to be manipulated. At this point, I’m f\\*\\*kin in. This is some digital wizardry sh\\*t and I’m about it. Cool a\\*\\* aesthetic, *and* I might see some wild sh\\*t. Bet. \n\nIf I knew the kind of Lovecraftian sh\\*t we were about to mess with, I never would have come through. He asks me to help him put together this machine. It kind of looked like the frame of an old projector tv with a weird metal funnel going in it. And in the back, that funnel fed into some weird looking device with wires and tubes. He’s hype the whole time and it’s a good vibe, for real it is. It’s the kind of energy that makes you feel like you’re doing something bigger than yourself. \n\n“What’s this thing do specifically?” Dude looks at me with the joy of a child in his face, eyes lit up and just beaming, with a big ole smile, “We’re about to find out!” I’m telling you, this dude knew he was onto something big. He made me feel like I knew it too. \n\nWe finish assembling it. He’s walking to go plug it in to the power and everything else, and I can’t help but stare into this funnel thing. Looking closely, there is a lot of little writing on each layer of the funnel. Some of it also looks hebrew, but some of it is nothing I’ve ever seen before. The funnel is about three feet deep, but when I looked at it, it just felt like it went on forever, like some strange optical illusion. An optical illusion never twisted my mind up quite like that, though. It only made this feel bigger and made me more curious. \n\nSo he finishes hooking everything up. Tells me, “okay, it’s all ready.” He looks at me with the most serious face, like it messed the whole vibe up in a second. \n\n“Look, I don’t know what’s going to happen,” bro said, “I need you to stand over by the bathroom door. If at all you feel unsafe or nervous go into the bathroom, shut the door, and lock it. I promise I will let you out when I’m certain it is safe.” ummm, “what the f\\*\\*k does that mean?” Bro looks at me now with that face again, he said, “if anything is off, go into that bathroom. If you look at anything and it just doesn’t look right, go in there. If the air gets heavy or your ears start to ring, go in there. If you suddenly find you cannot maintain focus at all, go in there. If you forget your name, go in there.” \n\n“My guy, what the f\\*\\*k? Are you serious?” The look on his face told me he was, but bro come on. \n\n“The bathroom is protected from the energies released by this machine, much like lead prevents xrays from passing through. If any of the energy gets loose and starts affecting you, it is important for your survival to go into that bathroom. When I clear the excess energies away, I will let you out.” \n\nMy heart was pumping adrenaline to every dark corner of my body. I needed a few deep breaths. “You said ‘important for my survival?’ Are you implying I might die right now?” \n\n“Maybe not die necessarily.” \n\n“What the f\\*\\*k does that mean?!”\n\n“If you just go in the bathroom, you’ll be okay.”\n\n“What if you ‘not die necessarily’? What do I do then?”\n\n“There is a panic button in the bathroom. The directions are with it.” That’s not reassuring.\n\nF\\*\\*k it, though, okay, let’s go. I’m ready as I’ll ever be. I go stand by the bathroom like I’m supposed to. He finishes typing the command into his computer. I was expecting something more dramatic with the last click of his keyboard, but when the device powered on, there was only a slight ringing sound. \n\nHe looked at me with the most sorrowful expression. He looked like he was about to emotionally break down right there. I was going to say something, but then he just quickly froze in place. Like every atom in his body seized up. Then his face looked like it was moving, but not at the same time. It hurt my head to look at. “Hey man, are you alright?” No change, no expression, no response. “Bro!” Still nothing man. His eye started to twitch soon followed by his mouth and the rest of his face. I can’t say why, but the sh\\*t didn’t sit right with me. \n\nI got into the bathroom and shut the door. Locked that b\\*\\*\\*h immediately. I figured I’d listen to his advice and just wait it out, but I hadn’t heard sh\\*t from the dude for like twenty minutes. That’s when the texts started. I was reading the panic button instructions when I felt my phone vibrate. It was f\\*\\*kin him, man. \n\n“Can you help me?”\n\n“I’ve got a good idea.”\n\n“Can you come help me?”\n\nLife is full of awful things. I’ve been afraid before, but this is not that fear. Everything in my body is telling me I need to get tf out of here. Move, do something, anything, but I can’t. There is something going on outside this room. It’s like he’s looking for something. Every footstep brings me closer to tears. Whatever it is, it’s not my dude anymore. My mind finally landed on, “dude, there’s a button for this.”\n\nThere are three simple directions for the panic button on a notecard. \n\n1. *Push once to turn of the machine, this will disrupt the flow of energy.*\n2. *Push two times to drain room of energy.*\n3. *Push three times to activate emergency mode.*\n\nThere is a little sidenote paragraph, which I can barely read, but the general gist makes it sound like it’ll burn down his entire house. I’m terrified, but I’m not trying to do that. \n\nSo, here is the biggest problem, when I pressed that button the first time, nothing seemed to happen, but dude made a whole interdimensional device, I’m sure he knows how to set this sh\\*t up. I just tried to push it twice, but when I did, I accidentally knocked it down from it’s perch. There is a hole in the wall where cables should be, but no cable. There is a port in the back where an ethernet cable should go, but there is none there. I don’t think this guy actually finished setting this up. There’s nothing on this that tells me it’s transmitting wirelessly either. \n\nI don’t want to feel like a child hiding in the bathtub anymore. I want to get the f\\*\\*k out of here and go home. Calling the police doesn’t feel like an option, this panic button is bummed out, and it’s gotten incredibly quiet out there. He’s not sending texts anymore. No one else is responding to my calls or texts. It’s been about three hours now. I just want to go home. I think I’m going to give it like another half hour before I’m dashing. Maybe I can run faster than him, or maybe over power him if I have to. \n\nHonestly, I think he left the house, or at least the basement. I’m not hearing anything anymore. I was originally going to ask for advice, but I’m calm and brave enough now to leave this room. I’m going to try to get out after I post this. If I don’t make it, hopefully people will find this and know somewhat what happened here. \n\nTo anyone who might investigate this, I know how this scene will look. I saw the basement too. He is a scientist, not a criminal, or lunatic. Please don’t try to paint him out to be a creep. He isn’t or wasn’t. I don’t believe he is himself anymore. \n\nIf I do make it, I’ll follow up on another post. \n\nOkay, I’m ready. Wish me luck, Reddit.",

The nearest town was about a 30 minute drive or a 50 minute bus journey, closest city being a 2 hour journey excluding the wait for transport.\n\nThe valley had its fair share of children my age too, about 30 children in my class growing up. Despite the amount of children my age, I never got along with any of them. \n\nI never really had access to much technology either, I’m part of that one generation where we grew up both playing outside and on technology. I never got access to the internet until I was 12, excluding using family computers. I was lucky enough to have the forest to explore. \n\nSo, when I was old enough, I would be allowed to take my dog to the forest to explore at my own will. Since I had gone there so much as a child and was usually responsible, I was allowed to explore alone when I was 8. (The forest was close to my home and if I wasn’t back by dark family members who knew the forest as well as I did would know where to look). \n\nSince then, I’ve always been fond of the forest. I graduated primary school and went to a comprehensive school about 20 minutes away. Then I made a few friends but they all lived too far away to hang out regularly. Id either play video games or explore the forest alone. \n\nBy the time I was 15 I had been to every part and knew it off by heart. I knew the terrain of each part too, and had different land marks. Through all of these years spending hours a day in the forest I never saw anything I could call weird or out of place.\n\nOkay so I found a few animal carcasses, and that was a little disturbing first time I came across one, but foxes lived in the forest. As much as I wanted to take a few bones as a trinket from my disturbing find I knew to leave it be. I didn’t want a disease even if it let me skip school.\n\nWhen I was 16, people began to cut down the forest. I’m not sure why, but since I was the only one enraged by this I assumed it was bound to happen. The forest lost its beauty aside from a few chunks of forestry still standing. So, I’d still spend time in those, but it was no where near as fun. I knew there was bound to be less wildlife but the forest felt a lot more dead than I expected. \n\nI remember hearing that the company cutting down the trees quit for no reason. They refused to specify why they’d quit, but I’m grateful they stopped as my favourite tree remained standing. It would have been cut if they hadn’t stopped.\n\nNow, I’ve caught you up with everything important to this story, here’s the whole reason I’m telling this to you.\n\nI still kept doing my regular walks through the forest but this time I would always be followed by a sense of dread. One specific day during  late august I had an argument with my family, this was a regular thing, so I went off to the mountain to just walk and calm down. Since my parents go to sleep relatively early, 9pm, and it would remain light until 10pm during summer, I decided I’d stay until about 9pm and get home by 9:30. \n\nIt was about 8:45 when I sat down by my favourite tree for a cigarette. Yes, I know smoking is bad for you, especially starting at such a young age, but at the time I couldn’t have cared less. I lit my cigarette and put the lighter down next to my feet. The sense of dread came but by this point I knew how to ignore it or just drown it out with music. \n\nI sat there and puffed for a little bit, just enjoying the scenery I’ve seen hundreds of times. It was getting dark, but only a little. I looked down to part of the forest where a small stream run through and sheep usually roamed. If you’d go a bit onwards from there you can find this awesome rock, it’s huge! \n\nAs I stared and contemplated going to the rock after my break I saw something move. It was tall, I could tell that as it moved through the trees, but I couldn’t make out what it was. Before I could realise that whatever I was witnessing was probably supposed to scare me, it was gone.\n\nOdd, but I ignored it. About 10 minutes later I decided to head to the rock. It would be an easier journey home if i did and I got to see the cool rock, so what’s the harm? … Well, a lot of harm. \n\nI cut through some trees and down a slope, then I followed the stream down. I passed where I saw the shadow move and the sense of dread became overbearing. My mind ran back to the shadow I saw wandering and I tried to shake it off, not being a believer in the paranormal. I thought ‘even if the paranormal were real, if they roamed this forest I certainly would’ve noticed sooner- I spent my whole childhood up here!’ \n\nI came towards the rock and climbed on top of it like usual. There’s a stunning view of the mountains if you know what trees to look through, and the added height from the rock helps so much. Though, what I least expected to see was the shadow. It moved quite slowly as if being careful. \n\nNow I had a good sense of its size due to it being a lot closer than before. It was tall, deer like but stood on its back legs and had human hands. A pair of antlers, long and winding, stood on tops of its head. \n\nOnce it noticed me, it stood still and stared. Standing on the rock usually made me feel tall, but I never felt smaller than during that moment. We stood there, both still, for a moment. \n\nThe creature began to move towards me, faster than when it had been exploring. I stumbled off of the rock and landed awkwardly on my ankle. I groaned in pain, knowing it was sprained at the very least. I’d sprained my ankle before and recognised the pain. The creature didn’t pity my state, it kept moving towards me. We were now face to face. Somehow, despite how it was still supposed to be somewhat light for a couple more hours, the forest became dark. \n\nI stared the creature in the face, oh how I wish I hadn’t. If I hadn’t looked at its face I wouldn’t have seen those small red eyes or that mouth. The mouth was the worst, it was large and wide, with many sharp pointy teeth all out of place. They were stained yellow and had traces of blood on the canines. This creature was not friendly. I scrambled to my feet and as I did it swung its arm for me, barely missing. \n\nI turned my phone torch on and sprinted away, not even daring to look back. I never wanted to see whatever the hell that was again. I got to an opening and it was light again, I was confused and turned back, the creature backing away into its dark patch of forest.\n\nI don’t hesitate to run home and I go straight to my room. My ankle was still in a lot of pain, so I just stayed in bed whilst rummaging my bag for the painkillers I always carried around. When night came, I was too disturbed to sleep.   \nI heard a scraping noise outside my window and my mind ran to all of the worst possible ideas. Even so, I looked out, and there it was. Those horrible teeth and everything. I quickly turned on my bedroom light, limping to my light switch of course, and it ran away. \n\nI’ve learnt something important, it hates light. Since then, it has followed me to dark places. I have to keep a flashlight on me and I keep a small lamp on by my window to scare it away. But I know that one day it will get me, and I am terrified of it. \n\nSo, learn from me. If you are exploring out in nature and you feel a sense of dread, leave. You don’t know what you may find.",

She had passed a number of food trucks and street vendors, but nothing seemed to pique her interest. She was on the verge of returning home in defeat when she spotted a street vendor selling skewers of grilled meat. The aroma was tantalizing, and Sarah's stomach growled with hunger.\n\nShe approached the vendor and requested two skewers. The man grinned and handed them to her, saying \"Enjoy!\" Sarah handed over a few dollars and sat down on a nearby bench to eat.\n\nThe meat was succulent and juicy, and Sarah couldn't get enough. She devoured the first skewer in no time and started on the second. But as she finished the second skewer, she began to feel strange. Her head was spinning and her stomach was roiling.\n\nShe tried to stand up, but her legs wouldn't cooperate. She collapsed onto the ground, barely conscious. She could hear the vendor laughing maniacally as he stood over her.\n\n\"You shouldn't have eaten that, my dear,\" he cackled. \"It was human flesh. And now you're one of us.\"\n\nSarah blacked out, her body writhing in agony as the transformation took hold. When she awoke, she was no longer human. She was a monster, just like the street vendor. And she was hungry. Famished. She licked her lips, eyeing the passing pedestrians with a renewed hunger.\n\nThe street vendor cackled again, relishing in the terror he had caused. And as Sarah joined him in his depraved, twisted game, the two of them roamed the streets, preying on unsuspecting victims and turning them into monsters like themselves.\n\nThey became the stuff of legend in the city, with people whispering about the \"cursed street food\" that turned people into monsters. No one knew where the vendor obtained his meat, but rumors circulated that he had made a deal with dark forces to sell human flesh in exchange for power.\n\nDespite the warnings, people continued to flock to the vendor, drawn in by the irresistible aroma of the grilled meat. They couldn't resist the temptation, even as they knew the risks. And one by one, they fell victim to the cursed street food, joining Sarah and the vendor in their never-ending hunt for human prey.\n\nAs the years passed, the number of monsters on the streets grew. They lurked in the shadows, waiting for their next victim. The city was in a state of perpetual fear, with people afraid to venture out at night. No one was safe from the cursed street food.\n\nSarah eventually became the leader of the monsters, her hunger and bloodlust only increasing with each passing year. She had long since lost any remnants of her humanity, consumed by the darkness that had taken hold of her. And the street vendor, the one who had begun it all, continued to ply his trade, always grinning as he watched people fall victim to his cursed offerings.\n\nThe horrors of the cursed street food seemed to have no end, and the city was trapped in a never-ending nightmare. And as the monsters roamed the streets, searching for their next victim, the people lived in constant fear, always wondering when they would be the next to fall prey to the cursed street food.",

As she drove home, the rain pounded against her windshield, making it hard to see. Suddenly, she heard a loud thud and felt her car shake. She had hit something.\n\nPanicked, Jane pulled over to the side of the road and got out of her car. It was pitch black and she could barely see a few feet in front of her. She called out, hoping whoever she had hit was okay, but there was no response. She fumbled in the darkness, trying to find her phone so she could call for help, but it was nowhere to be found.\n\nAs she searched, she heard a strange noise behind her. She turned around and saw a figure standing in the rain, but she couldn't make out any details. It was as if the figure was surrounded by a thick fog.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Jane called out, her voice shaking. \"What do you want?\"\n\nThere was no response. The figure just stood there, seeming to watch her. Jane's heart raced as she backed away, trying to get back to her car. She tripped and fell to the ground, scraping her knees on the rough asphalt.\n\nAs she scrambled to get up, she felt a hand on her shoulder. She screamed and thrashed, trying to escape the grip, but it was too strong. She was lifted to her feet and turned to face the figure.\n\nAnd that's when she saw it. The face was twisted and grotesque, with glowing red eyes and a mouth full of sharp teeth. It was a creature from her worst nightmares, and it was standing right in front of her.\n\nJane's mind raced as she tried to think of a way to escape. She remembered something her grandfather had told her when she was a child: \"If you're ever in trouble, just close your eyes and wish for the time to reverse. It might not work, but it's worth a try.\"\n\nJane closed her eyes and wished with all her might for the time to reverse. She felt a sudden jolt, and when she opened her eyes, she was back in her car. It was still raining, but the storm seemed to have passed. She looked in the rearview mirror and saw the figure was gone.\n\nShe breathed a sigh of relief and started the car. As she drove home, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was still off. When she got home, she went to bed, hoping to forget the terrifying experience.\n\nBut the next morning, when she woke up, she found herself back on the side of the road, with the creature standing in front of her. She realized that she was trapped in some kind of time loop, reliving the same terrifying moment over and over again.\n\nShe closed her eyes and wished for the time to reverse, hoping to escape the nightmare. But no matter how many times she tried, she couldn't break free. She was trapped in the darkness, with the creature standing in front of her, forever.",

        "text": "I have been living in a small town in the countryside of northern Louisiana for a few years now, it has always been great. I bought a fairly big house with my wife and now we are raising our two beatiful children, Maria and James. There's just over a thousand people living in this town which just what we wanted. We have everything we could've ever asked for. However, at the end of last year, weird things started happening.  A lot of animals were being killed during the night, even in broad daylight. I remember a farmer who claimed to have seen a weird creature prowling around his farm, he described it as a humanlike body with elongated extremities, but we didn't listen to him since he has a record of lying to get attention of the local newspaper, and since his animals weren't killed, we didn't believe him.\n\nOne night, I heard weird noises in the backyard, but since we have a dog I assumed it was him. The next night the noises returned and, since the dog was in my bedroom, I said to myself that it must be a wild animal who found our house and now spends the nights there, hiding from other animals. After a week or so of peace, I heard the noises again. I decided to go to the backyard and check what was going on, as I stepped into the grass that covers our backyard I heard what seemed to me at the time like heavy breathing, and seconds later, something walking over the leaves that covered the first few meters of forest, something clumsy that for the noises it made it didn't seem real. I ran back to the house to get a flashlight, a knife and to put my boots on, I also grabbed my wristwatch, I checked and it was 4 a.m.. As I ventured into the forest, I had a strange sensation, as if something was watching me, This forest was, at most around 5 miles long and 2 miles. I could already see that dawn was starting, that meant I had been walking in a straight line for just over two and a half hours, I checked the physical activity tab on my watch, as I stared at the screen panic started to kick in:\n\n`Distance walked:`\n\n`7.3 miles, NEW RECORD`\n\nI couldn't understand what was going on. The forest was suppossed to end two and a half miles ago. As I stared into the distance, thinking what would happen to me, I catched a glimpse of a light. From what I could see, it looked to be inside of a construction and less than half a mile away. I started walking, feeling that I was going to be saved but as I approached the building, my opinion changed quickly. \n\nThe building was abandoned, and it looked like it had been abandoned for a long time now. Since I was lost, I decided to enter the facility. It was quite big and a lot more modern than what it looked like from the outside. I started looking for food or water, but I found something much darker than I expected.",

But I do have a above average wardrobe since I had alot of clothes.\nAt the time I was left with 1 cat... One of the sadly died from lung cancer a few months before this happened and the other one went missing in the woods near my house (we live in the countryside)\nI wake up around 12pm to an almost scratching like sound somewhere near me, i could tell exactly where it was since I was pretty tired... I got up thinking it was my cat outside my bedroom door wanting to come in.\nI opened the door to find... Nothing... There wasn't anything there.\nThe hallway light was on as usual because my sister doesn't like the dark and I could hear my dad downstairs watching his computer.\nI didn't think much of this and closed the door and went back to bed.\nI woke up about 10 minutes later to more scratching but this time I could hear meowing.\nI though to my self \"what the hell is this cat doing\" and went to check Infront of the door again... Once again there was nothing there.\nAt this point I didn't know what to think... The noise stopped so I thought maybe he just runs away when I open the door.\nSo I decided to stay awake this time to listen closer and maybe find him. \n5 minutes later I heard louder scratching... This time I got goosebumps.\nIt was from my wardrobe. I could tell since this time I was wide awake instead of half asleep the last 2 times. \nI though to myself \"shit the cat is stuck in the wardrobe poor thing\"\nI got up\nWalked over\nGrabbed the handle\nStarted gently pulling it open\nAs I did that the scratching stopped.\n\nI thought surely he's in here \n\nNothing\nThe wardrobe was empty\nI thought \"huh\" and started opening all the doors and drawers to see if he was anywhere else...\nHe wasn't\nI checked outside my window to see if he was just trying to get in but he wasn't there\nI got back into my bed and hid under the covers thinking \"wtf is going on\".\nI was creeped out... I was sure I heard my cat I'm my room, I checked under my bed and desk... But he was nowhere to be found.\n5 more minutes go by of me sitting in my bed wondering what just happened when suddenly...\n*Meow*\n\n*Meow*\n\n*Meow*\nI sat straight up and started listening very closely...\nThe meowing got louder and the scratching sounded like nails on a chalk board.\nIt was clearly coming from the wardrobe.\nI nearly pissed myself. I stood up and it all stopped.\nI walked over the the wardrobe and swung it open.\nThere was nothing there...\nI rushed out of my room shouting my dad. He shortly after came upstairs and I told him what had happened...\nHe asked if I was dreaming while he checked the wardrobe. \nI obviously told him no, it was way to vivid to have been a dream and it just happened a second ago right before I shouted him.\nHe looked at me like I was insane and told me in a very soft tone \"there's nothing in here, so I don't know what you heard\" \nI said goodnight and got back into my bed and got to sleep... I haven't heard it since that night and I'm glad for that\n\nTo this day my dad doesn't believe me \nBut I know it happened and it was the strangest thing to ever happen to me",

De André made a readaptation of this song but the original text is as old as the little church of the village where i live.\n2000 people, a piazza smaller than a grocery store park and a 1300 years old church all of this 40 minutes away from a proper civilized place, up on the hills of the lower Appennino Emiliano Romagnolo. I live here and as my description stated there's nothing here, so why the hell did our American relatives choose to visit this instead of the many more interesting places of Italy?\n\nFor all my life they were just the \"patacca cousins who ran away from the Duce\" my grandpa resented them for this, they did not stay and fight with the resistance like him. He never told me anything, where they came from, what their names were and got mad when they were mentioned.\n\nThen one day grandpa died and his hated relatives too. Their grandsons one day woke up and discovered they didn't know anything about where grandpa came from and contacted us. I don't know how exactly did they manage that but they find our address and sent a letter in a mix of english and google translated italian. After checking up and verify they were indeed our relatives and not a nigeran prince who wants to deposit something on our bank account we gave them a number to text to, my number.\n\nI am the only one on the family that speaks a decent english so i had the task to translate, chat and answer whatever questions the \"patacca cousins\" might've asked. \nIt was fine, i didn't mind it, i taught them a couple of words, how to curse, some blasphemy and that ravioli and tortelli were two different things. \nOne day they told us they were planning to visit their grandfather's home (wich is our great ball busting job to keep from collapsing by the way) to \"rediscover our roots\". \n\nThey can't form a sentence, they don't know dialect and the peak of tradition for them is makig tortellini for christmas (also those aren't tortellini! They are called cappelletti!). I tried to tell them off, i even offered to take them for a tour of Bologna or Rimini or Ravenna and taking a 2 hours train ride but nope. Grandpa's shitty village it is.\n\nNow, as i said, there's Nothing here. And we'd like to keep it as it is because, if Something would be here that would be a trouble for everyone.\n\nI'll be as directed as i can, take this however you want but it's a fact: everyday and everynight, 24/7 Something roams the streets, and it's not human.\nIt never talks, never stops, never does anything but walking. It can happen however that It could knock on your door at night. If that happens let It enter.\nIt'll sit at your table, you'll have to offer It something, it doesn't matter what, he won't take it. After a few minutes It'll get up and lie on your bed for a couple of minutes, them It'll thank you and leave. \n\nYou can talk to It but it is not a good idea, whatever you'll tell It doesn't matter, It'll take your words as a wish, take what you offered earlier and leave, your wish will come true, even if you just asked who was he, and no one knows what It actually wants as a payiment (that's why it's not a good idea to try this).\nDon't ever try to talk to It on the streets. You'll die. Plain and simple.\n\nBut what you must, under no circumstances, do is not open the door. My cousins's granpa was dumb enough to try this shit. \nMy grandma told me what happened: everybody in the village had to leave an animal outside of their door in the night. Her family was poor and she had to leave her hedgehog outside, she loved that little guy. After that night anybody who didn't leave an animal outside disappeared, their houses were a mess but no one was inside. She still remembered the screams that followed in the nights, 3 nights of screaming, yelling and pleading. When she got dementia she saw those night again and again. I am she is now in peace.\n\nI don't know how exactly he did survive that, but it must've been part of why he left Italy. I don't want his offsprings to come here and cause another mess but i surely as hell can't tell them \"your granpa angered death itself and if you come here i am sure you'll be next on the list\". What am i supposed to do? I can't just tell them to ignore the mysterious clearly non human figure that will knock on their door, and i am sure that will happen. My granfather asked that last time It knocked on his door. The answer he recived was \"cerco tuo fratello. Il pagamento sono i suoi discendenti\" \"i am looking for your brother. I want his descendants\".\n\nIf you are reading this don't come here. There's nothing here.",

        "text": "|Part 1| \n\n  \nAwakening, I lifted my head up from the lab table, the side of my face sticky with sweat. My fellow colleague, Dr. Raj, stopped shaking me as I slowly got up. \n\n“What happened?”, I asked him while I blearily looked around the mess. Our items and equipment were strewn everywhere in what was once a pristine lab.\n\n“Aurora’s missing! She isn’t anywhere in the labs!”, he frantically replied.\n\nFirstly, introductions are in order. It’s important that you know this! Aurora is a project by the shadowy corporation that hired me and my fellow researchers, aiming to create a stronger, smarter artificial human. Three years ago, we finally found success and created a person: namely Aurora. \n\nIf you don’t get it, think of a normal human. Now, imagine we made the human ground up with various nanomaterials in a lab. Like their brains, guts, everything is like what’s in an actual human and functions as such, but made artificially. Oh, and it makes the human smarter and stronger. Can’t forget that. Well, that would be what we did with Aurora. Or something like that, I wasn’t employed there when they did all of that.\n\nIn the lab, we mostly carried out various activities and tests to evaluate her physical and mental capabilities. That is, until the day all of this unfolded. A couple hours before, we had just finished a physical test with Aurora (rock climbing, if that’s important). Returning to the lab, we were treated to a pleasant surprise. \n\nSpending around half an hour in the kitchen, Aurora walked out with a tray full of cupcakes. Standing in front of me and my colleague, Dr Sam, she nervously muttered, “I- uh- wanted to do something for you, so I made some cupcakes. Can you please try them?”\n\nSmiling widely at her, I responded,”Of course! Give me the tray, I’ll give it out.” before curiously asking, “Where did you learn to bake?”.\n\n“Dr Diana lets me use her phone now and then”, she replied. While I had never seen this happen before, I accepted this little fact without any opposition. Given that it was lunchtime, I passed around the cupcakes and we all gorged ourselves on her cupcakes without caution.\n\nIn hindsight, she must have drugged the cupcakes to render us unconscious, while she escaped.\n\nAs I slowly recollected the events leading up to this, Diana and Sam ran back into the lab with a shiny metal tablet, having come to the conclusion that she was not anywhere in the facilities.\n\n“The location tracker shows she’s going to the docks. Get your equipment and go to the car now!” Diana hastily instructed as we made for the garage where the company car was. We quickly drove out of the nondescript corporate building that served as our headquarters and made for the docks.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Diana quickly briefed us on the next course of action. “She’ll probably take a boat or something and get into the ocean. We need to intercept and capture her with the company boat before she gets out too far. And we’ll shoot her with the tranquilisers here if she gets too rowdy. Got it?”\n\n“And you, newbie. You do know to use the tranquiliser gun for her if we need to, right? No other weapon can affect her well enough.”, she asked, specifically turning to me.\n\n“Of course I do!”, I replied. I never expected to use it, but I still hadn’t forgotten my onboarding training from the previous year.\n\nSoon, we managed to reach the docks, only to see a lone mid-sized boat speed away from us. I didn’t know enough about boats to identify its type, but it appeared to be both fast and seaworthy, the perfect getaway boat.\n\nAnd in one of the slips…\n\n“Oh, god!”, I said as I stared at the pools of blood in the water. A few metres away, two bodies were floating, covered in bleeding stab wounds. They were young men, no older than 20. There was no doubt who did this… the brutality of their deaths still shocked me. Behind me, Sam stopped dead in his tracks, covering his mouth in shock as he took in the horrifying scene.\n\nWhile we stood in horror, Diana quickly regained her composure. “Come on!”, she jolted us, “There’s no time for this!”.\n\n“That’s her! The tracker says she’s there! We need to get her now!” Diana yelled as we navigated the concrete paths along the rows of boats. The scorching Miami heat had caused me to already be drenched in sweat as I ran.\n\nA minute later, we stopped in front of a red and white boat not too different from the boat we were currently pursuing. \n\n“And there it is, our boat!”, Dr. Raj exclaimed. “All of you get in and figure out where she’s going, I’ll drive this thing!”\n\n“You can pilot boats?”, I asked incredulously as I hurried onto the deck.\n\n“Of course! Now tell me where I should pursue her!”\n\n“She’s going out into the open sea! Hurry or we’ll miss her!”\n\nThe boat started with a deafening roar and turned its way out of the harbour into the open ocean, where Aurora was escaping to. \n\nA short while later, Sam shouted, “There it is! That’s the boat she took!”, while pointing a finger straight at a speeding blue boat. Glancing at the red dot denoting her location on the tracker, it was clear that the boat was indeed piloted by her. We continued speeding up to her to capture the boat, but she always outmanoeuvred us at every turn.\n\n“Fuck this”, said Diana, “Sam pass me the loudspeaker!”\n\nSam reached into a large black bag and pulled out a loudspeaker.\n\n“Aurora, it’s us! The researchers!”. Her voice softened. “Stop this and come back. I promise there won’t be any consequences. Just get here right now.”\n\nThe only response we got was a few bullets shot our way. “Duck!”, I yelled as they whizzed by our boat, almost as if they were intentionally shot to miss us. \n\n“Forgot to tell you”, started Sam, “but she seems to have taken our credit cards, a few guns, and- “\n\nA grenade whizzed by just a hair’s length away, causing the boat to manoeuvre sharply to the right.\n\n“And a grenade launcher!”, he finished.\n\n“Aurora. End this now!”, Diana exclaimed calmly, but it didn’t seem that Aurora was listening, judging by the continued volley of bullets approaching us.\n\n“Everyone on deck, fire! We need to stop her from speeding away!” Raj shouted as we continued trying to avoid the flying bullets the best we could. \n\nImmediately, I swiftly pulled out my gun and loaded the tranquilisers in, before taking aim and firing at her boat. The bullets flew across the blue sea and…\n\nI wish I could say I got a clean shot straight at her, but of course, we ended up firing at the general vicinity of her boat. It was difficult to aim straight at her as her boat was quite far away and moving erratically.\n\nAs another projectile flew at us, I yelled, “Raj! Get us closer to her boat we need a better shot-”. But before I could complete, the boat lurched and shook with a bang, knocking us all off our feet.\n\n“Aaaah! What happened?”\n\n“One of our engines is down!” Raj yelled from the cabin. “We can’t chase her anymore! We need to get back on the other engine!”\n\nAs the boat tilted dangerously to its side, Diana yelled, “We’ll call this one off! Go back! We can’t get her like this!”. As our damaged boat hobbled back to the coast, the blue boat we were pursuing eventually became smaller and smaller until it faded out into the horizon. Somehow, we reached the docks while staying somewhat dry, and left the boat to hopefully be salvaged.\n\nBack home at the lab, we swiftly cancelled our credit cards, but it seemed to be too late. Almost all the money had been withdrawn! I surmised that she had huge plans for herself. \n\nAfterwards, we sat dejectedly while monitoring the bright red dot. In particular, Diana seemed affected by our failure to bring her back. The deaths of those men, too, weighed heavily on her, as it did all of us. ,Wanting to distract her, I decided to scoot over to where she was sitting.\n\n“Hey”, I said.\n\n“Hey”, she replied, looking up from her screen for a moment.\n\n“So, um, what’s the next plan?”\n\n“Well, we can’t really engage her on the open water right now. So, we’ll wait until she’s going to reach land. She can’t be out forever, right? Then, we’ll go wherever she is.”\n\n“Sounds like a plan.”, I replied. Well, it was the best we had anyways.\n\nA few days later, we got to put our plan into action.\n\nPointing to the location tracker, Diana announced, “She’s approaching Cancún.”.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/NightbringerWrites/)",

        "text": "To start this off, I've never done this before. However there isn't much to lose, so here's my story. Ever since I was young, I've been more attuned to the supernatural. Starting when I was 11, I had an outer body experience where this snake figure with white slitted eyes visited me. It said one day, it would come for me and that I shouldn't resist. It threatened to torture my family whilst I watched, that I'd have to do as they say. I got woken up by my mum, asking why I was screaming help me over and over...I didn't even hear the screams. \n\n\nYears pass, occasionally I'd see those same slitted eyes in the dark. Weird, very vivid dreams keep plaguing me, that something is always chasing me, I feel the darkness and it always says it's going to get me. Things get worse, I start drawing Norse runes (I know, totally weird but I went into a trance when it happened.) Drew them on a mirror, I have pictures of said runes. Also, I'm not prone to hallucinations before anyone asks. \n\nIn my sleep I'll visit these places I've never been to, one was a place with an endless green field and a sun that was almost too bright. A guy in red and gold armour, told me to be careful. One was a bar with no outside details, a bar with booths yet all the windows showed was white bright light. People I didn't recognise were there, old and young. The most recent was this very Roman kind of place, pillars with eagles on the tops, the baths and people dressed very similar for that era of time. It was an island, it was peaceful though. Then evil wise, we are talking foggy, dark forests or trapped in some very old fashioned house. \n\nI sometimes speak in a dilect that is not known to me, and I feel just like I want answers. It's so frustrating, to go through all of this without really knowing why. Perhaps it's some kind of curse, but maybe not. \n\nThese things keep happening to me, and I thought writing this might get me some answers that I'm looking for. I've always been drawn to the supernatural, it's always just been there. It seems like it'll keep happening, but I don't want to stumble in the dark anymore.\n\nMore recently, the vivid dreams keep happening like something is trying to tell me what I need to know. By the time I wake up, it completely disappears. it feels on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't remember. it's very annoying.\n\n\nSometimes when I close my eyes, I see faces I haven't seen before. Or eyes looking back at me. I honestly don't know why I've been going through this, and I'm hoping maybe some of you have been through similar things? I'm not mentally ill or anything and I don't take drugs, I'm just looking for help or advice.",

        "text": "I was in my early teens at the time, but I recall it like it was yesterday. It all started in the early 2000’s when my family and I moved into a new house. My parents bought the house, but it needed a complete renovation. What happened in that house will give me nightmares for years to come.\r\n\r\nWhen I laid eyes on the house for the first time, I didn’t know what to think of it. It was an unfriendly and breezy autumn day. My parents finished work just before we came to see the house, and the twilight was just starting to settle in. There wasn’t a spec of cloud, and the sun was setting, casting its amber light upon the sky making this a sublime sight. A biting wind was breezing steadily, making the trees move ever so slightly and leaves to fall, creating their amber blanket at the trees’ feet.\r\n\r\nThe house was a dark little bungalow surrounded by a garden with a tall concrete fence establishing the perimeter. Thick, overgrown weeds and bushes were obscuring the view of the front garden. A footpath made of worn and hardened soil was leading the way from the gate to the entrance of the house. Walking towards the back of the house, I was greeted by more overgrown weeds and bushes. Through these I could distinguish the shed at the far-right side of the rear garden. As I laid eyes upon it, a knot formed in my throat, and an empty feeling formed in my stomach. This was not hunger, it was different. It is hard to describe this feeling, especially through the eyes of a little boy. I could not explain it though, and I could not understand why I felt that way.\r\n\r\nAs I was gazing upon the rear garden, my attention got drawn towards an acquainted voice calling my name from behind me, acknowledging her as my mother. She did not know where I wondered off to and wanted me to go inside the house with her. Hearing her voice made me forget about the sinking feeling I had just a few moments before. She was standing just in front of the entrance door and was leaning over what looked like an unfinished brick handrail. I turned around and walked towards my mom. As I got in front of the house, 3 footsteps greeted me. At the top of them, my mother was just entering the house and was calling me to follow her. I followed and ascended the steps. I slowly crept into the dark dingy abode and the front door gave a screech as it closed behind us, eerie enough to give me momentarily goosebumps. Looking around me and inside the rooms, everything seemed dreary and timeworn. Small windows provided enough light to illuminate the darkness and nothing more. The paint was shedding off the walls and the doors were misshapen and did not shut suitably, allowing rays of light to escape through. The air was damp and thick, giving an uneasy feeling.\r\n\r\nI continued to look around until I got to the room which I would later find out that it was about to be mine. This room was no different than the rest when it comes to overall condition, however its window was facing the rear garden. The overgrown bushes and weeds were tall enough to reach the window, and as wind blew, they would leave a moving shadow inside the room. Furthermore, the old window would allow a small breeze of wind to seep through, creating a faint howling noise. Gazing through the window, the shed at the back of the garden caught my attention again. The sun was almost finished setting, and the light was drastically diminished, so I could not distinguish its features, but the uneasiness returned. I could not understand what it was that would make me feel that way, however the knot in my throat and the emptiness in my stomach started forming again.\r\n\r\nA shadowy figure appeared before my eyes, looking like a slender cat jumping on top of the shed and looking towards the sky. The figure didn’t seem ordinary, having atypical long legs and a hunched back. The unnerving feeling, coupled with the faint howling noise latched on, rendering me unable to look away. As hairs were beginning to stand up on my forearms, the figure turned its head towards me with a fast and jerky movement. I stared at its face and those beady lifeless eyes gleamed as they reflected the light and fright overwhelmed me. I mustered all the strength I could, and I turned around and got out in the lobby. I followed my parents which were just getting ready to exit the house. Upon seeing my rattled and staggered figure, they smiled and asked if I’ve seen a ghost. I did not reply, although I wanted to, but I could not risk being seen like a scared little boy.\r\n\r\nMy parents and I soon left the house. I would forget about this encounter, and I would never see that cat again, however more eerily encounters were due to take place in that house. I was just unaware of this at that time. Encounters which would change the way I see things forever.\r\n\r\nIt took my parents around 7-8 months to renovate the house. Once it was ready, we started the moving process packing everything up and before we knew it, we were all ready. I was also rather cheerful and enthusiastic to finally have my own room. I was marvelled when I saw the house again, as it was now completely changed. The footpath leading to the house was now paved with concrete. To the left of it, the weeds and bushes were now gone, replaced with lovely flowers and grass. To the right of it, a driveway for the car with a small summer gazebo with a table and 2 benches appeared before me. The space was big enough to store and mend several cars. It was all serene. It was our place.\r\n\r\nThe back garden was also transformed. We had a suitable garden with a few tomato and cucumber plants, herbs, and a few fruit-bearing trees too. Albeit these were small trees, but it was still amazing how the place was changed. The shed at the back garden was still there, however it was now made of brick, and it was now all tidy and nice. Seeing all of this, I now fancied to check the inside of the house. So, I spun round, got in front of the 3 steps leading to the front door and joyfully ascended them. I happily went forward and opened the front door. I could not believe my eyes. The once peeling walls were now covered in fresh white paint, the floors were all changed to brick-looking tiles, the doors were all new and the eerily sentiment was now completely gone. The place smelled fresh, and it was all clean and welcoming. It was now a home.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing how excited I was, my parents showed me to my room. At last, I had a room of my own. The room boasted the same brilliant white paint throughout, but with gorgeous hardwood floor. The window was new, and it closed well. Beautiful white see-through curtain complimented the whole atmosphere. No more howling noise when the breeze of the wind was hitting the window. No more eerily feelings about the house. I was in heaven. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed having my own room and my own bed. I enjoyed the privacy and the fact that my parents wouldn’t know exactly when I went to sleep. All was marvellous. Inevitably though, autumn came. It was now a year since I first laid eyes on the house, and I didn’t ponder of my first encounter. Bizarre things started occurring, however I did not dwell on them. On occasions, I would wake up in the middle of the night, all sweaty but cold at the same. Other times, peculiar noises would make disturb my slumber, but I would just brush these off and go back to sleep. These would occur every so often, increasing in regularity as we were advancing towards winter.\r\n\r\nSomething different happened one night. A similar feeling to the one I felt when I first laid eyes upon the shed awakened me in the middle of the night. A knot formed in my throat and a sinking feeling in my stomach developed. I decided to have a sip of water from the bottle placed on my nightstand, in the hopes that it’ll go away. I leaned to my left, reaching the bottle with my right hand. Doing so, my attention got drawn towards the wall opposite the window. Shadows which looked like slowly moving trees were cast onto my wall. I recognised these as being the small trees in our back garden, however my curiosity had the better of me. I had a generous gulp of water from the bottle, and I sat up the bed. I looked to my right, towards the window and what I saw astonished me.\r\n\r\nThe moon was shining stunningly, lighting the garden in a beautiful faint white light. The wind was breezing slightly, just enough to move the trees slowly and faintly from side to side. I needed to get a better view, and as I stood up, I sighted a thick white fog covering the soil through which I could not see. It was a few centimetres thick, and it was motionless against the wind. As I was looking outside, I heard distant dogs barking. It was as if the animals have noticed a presence and they were barking and growling as a warning. Describing this is difficult, although is comparable to when they bark and howl towards the moon, seemingly purposeless, as if to keep strangers at bay. My feeling of uneasiness did not falter, however I decided to go back to sleep to brush the feeling away. And so, I got back in bed, rolled myself away from the window and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNothing further took place for a few days, then something alike ensued again. A sunken feeling awoke me. Dogs were barking again, but the noise grew in volume and proximity. Moonlight was illuminating the darkness, casting the usual shadows on my wall. This time I could see the shadow of a crow as well. Perplexed by this, against my uneasiness, I cautiously stood up to look outside, inching myself towards the window and peeking through a corner. The sight before me did not reveal a single crow, but a dozen ravens. The birds were standing motionless and completely silent on the trees and shed, seemingly captured in a trance of some sort. A similar but heavier fog covered most of the plants, still standing motionless, and blocking from view whatever was happening underneath it.\r\n\r\nAs I visually surveyed the area, I spotted a distant glimpse of something peculiar which shook me to my core. There was a huge bonfire towards the horizon and several people were standing in a circle around it, potentially carrying out some sort of an unholy ritual. They were dressed in black robes and were holding each other’s hands towards the sky, and encircling the fire. I curled my fingers into fists and rubbed my eyes in disbelief. Was I dreaming? What was going on? I turned around and checked the clock on my nightstand. It was 3 o’clock. Turning to gaze again at the peculiar gathering which made my uneasiness reach its peak, I used my right thumb and index finger to gently grab hold of my forearm’s skin, squeezing in the process. I felt it! I was awake! I squinted my eyes as I inched towards the window to get a better view at the sinister imagery unfolding before my eyes. \r\n\r\nNothing in my life could have prepared me to what followed. I misjudged the distance to the window, as I bumped into it ever so slightly, causing a minute amount of noise. In the blink of an eye, the ravens which were standing as still as statues all turned their heads facing me. I could feel their beady eyes staring right through me and into my soul as I felt the pit in my stomach overwhelm me. In the following second I heard a high-pitched screech, which silenced all and every single sound in a blink of an eye. The sound was loud, reverberating and echoing all around me. The hairs on my forearms stood up and I felt overwhelmed by a sense of true terror. I covered my ears, moved away from the window, and hunched over towards the ground, but I couldn’t stop the ghastly screech flowing through my brain. It felt like an eternity of agony but as the screech ended, everything was gone. The ravens disappeared. The bonfire and the people were nowhere to be seen. Even the fog covering the soil was not there anymore! In the blink of an eye everything was normal again. The ringing I could still hear in my ears was a painful reminder that what had just unfolded was real.\r\n\r\nI could not sleep again that night. That memory kept me awake and bestowed me with nightmares in the nights to come. My rational mind was trying to make sense of it all but couldn’t. I started arguing with myself, in an attempt to convince myself that I had a nightmare, a hallucination or a creation of my sickened mind. Imagination and nothing else I thought, but the memory was so wholly visceral and vivid. Furthermore, there was one painful reminder which I could not brush off though. When I pinched my forearm, I’ve done so with enough vigour to cause a mark. That was my single true confirmation that what has happened that night had been real. I have lived the events that night! I was awake! But I wasn’t supposed to see what I saw! That’s right, I saw something which I was not supposed to see. I dwelled on these thoughts days on end, but I was fighting my sanity and I was losing. I had yearned that nothing like that would ever ensue again. Regrettably that could not have been farther from certainty.\r\n\r\nAfter many sleepless nights and even more nightmares which have woken me in agonising terror, the unspeakable materialised. The autumn was coming to a cold, wet and windy end and the leafless trees looked like shadows of their former beauty, echoing the moonlight and resembling skeletons. A rare natural occurrence took place, one which is usually called a blood moon. The moon was shining strong and amber, bathing the earth into a ghostly warm light. There was not a spec of cloud in the sky, and the stars were shining beautifully. Various night birds would cross the sky every now and then, singing their song and completing what seem like a beautiful yet condemning sight.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly 3 o’clock when my scarce sleep was disturbed yet again by a sinking feeling of dread. As my eyes opened, I found myself covered in darkness, the only glimmer being the moonlight seeping through my window. Shadows of the ghastly crooked trees were cast onto my wall, along with ravens taking rest on the leafless branches. The unfolding sight strengthened my feelings and making my skin form goosebumps. I soon realised that I was a prisoner in a void of silence. I listened but I could not hear anything but my heartbeat. It felt like the world around me has fallen into a deep trance, through which not even sound could pass. I sat up in my bed, knocking my sheets over to one side in the process, and I turned towards the window. Anxiety coursing through me reached a fever pitch.\r\n\r\nI stood up and slowly walked towards the window, spellbound by the unfolding sight. The ghastly mist was covering the soil like a blanket yet again undoubtedly indicating that something unfathomable was about to take place. Just as I recognised from the shadows, ravens were resting in the crooked trees, all looking towards the window. Towards me. Oh, the moon was vast and crimson that night. It was shining its light on the ground turning the eery fog into crimson, and the ravens’ eyes into red beads. Those red beady eyes were staring through me, into my very existence, sinking me into a dreadful terror.\r\n\r\nAs I stood there, mesmerised and terrified, a dreadful smell of decaying flesh invaded my nostrils. The stench of death encircled me whole, not permitting me to understand where it was emanating from. A pit formed into my stomach as I stopped myself retching from the disgusting odour. Just as I brought my hand up to cover my mouth and nose, a hand dragging on the side of the shed stopped me. Before the hand had disappeared into the darkness, a female figure appeared, emerging from behind the shed. As I was questioning the sight unfolding in front of me, the figure was looking and heading straight towards me. She was walking slowly and spasmodic, dragging her feet through the crimson fog.\r\n\r\nAs she got closer and closer, I could start distinguishing her features. A sense of true terror froze me into place, unable to move or look away. She wore a long and filthy black dress, so long that I could not see the end of it as she emerged from the darkness. A long black and knotty hair was waving to one side as if it was struck by gusts of wind, even though the air was completely still. Her bony fingers with long rotting nails were moving unnaturally before her as he walked towards me. One hand was holding what looked like a coin necklace, rubbing her filthy thumb against the face of it, whilst the other was moving inexplicably, as if casting a spell, fingers and joints snapping in the process.\r\n\r\nShe then stood right in front of my window. The putrid smell of decaying flesh was unbearable, but I could not move. As much as I struggled, I was completely powerless. Her hair continued to move as I stared at her, uncovering her face as if a gust of wind has blown from the front. What uncovered made me fall to my knees. Her white putrefying face was covered in dark, deep scars, looking completely drained of blood. Black sunken eyes were staring through me, and in them I could see the fires of hell, pulling me towards. She then opened her mouth, revealing dark pointy teeth as she started calling my name and grotesquely smiling. I screamed! Oh, I screamed and continued screaming from the top of my lungs, using every single fibre of my being, but to no avail. No sound broke through, as the silence around me remained unharmed. All hope was gone as nothing in the world could protect me now, and the witch knew it. She smirked at me in confirmation of my impending doom, as pure, unadulterated terror overwhelmingly washed over me.\r\n\r\nThe whole sight was unholy. I was utterly and truly powerless. I was caught in the necromancers’ spell and I felt completely drained. The rotten stench of death was suffocating me, the silence around me was deafening me and the darkness was blinding me. All I could see was the witch. All I could hear was her fiendish laugh. “What is about to happen to me?” I thought as I came to the bitter conclusion of lost hope. “I just hope it will be quick” I thought as I was losing my will to live. The cold and wet touch of a tear rolled down my cheek as my life started flashing before my eyes. The visions showed me my mother and my father. It revealed to me our happy memories together and all the happy time we spent together. When I felt that it was all coming to a lethal conclusion, I saw my father again. He took my teary face into his large palms, looked into my eyes and with his deep and robust but at the same time heartfelt and loving voice he demanded me to scream. “Scream!” - that was all he commanded me. Using the very last strength I could muster from my dying being, I clenched my fists and arched forward. I closed my eyes, filled my lungs with the pungent stench and I screamed. I heard my voice slowly breaking through the deafening silence. I could not see nor feel anything, and I knew that if I stopped, I would be gone from amongst the living. This was all or nothing. My very last stance. I screamed until my very last breath left my body, and I fell to the floor.\r\n\r\nI woke up to the sight of my father. He was next to me, on his knees, trying to wake me up. For a second I thought I was gone, but alas this was not the case. I shot up from the floor and wrapped my arms tight around him. “Thank you”, I said, and I started crying in relief. It was all back to normal, and I was alive. Somehow, I defeated the witch. Later that day, once I calmed down, I explained everything to my father. I was afraid he wouldn’t believe me, but to my relief, that was not the case. He told me a story about a witch, story which was passed onto him from generations. He never saw the witch himself, nor did he know anyone who has managed to defeat her, but he knew what I was talking about. \r\n\r\nAfter that night, my parents brought a priest to christen the house. The witch did not leave me alone for years to follow, however she was now powerless against me. Some eerie noises would still wake me up occasionally, and I would still have nightmares about that night, but these were just that. Nightmares and nothing else. I am now glad I am alive, and I never want to feel that powerless again.",

        "text": " I looked down at the pregnancy test for what seemed to be the hundredth time that day, it was positive. I was pregnant. How could this be? I hadn't gotten intimate with anyone in years, let alone kiss someone.\n\nMy last boyfriend was when I was 15, I was now 23. I decided to try a pregnancy test for shits and giggles when my best friend Lexi jokingly suggested I could be pregnant due to my moodiness and stomach aches. I had no clue why or how this was happening.\n\nI called in to work the next day and headed to the doctor. I was extremely uncomfortable and extremely scared. I couldn't stop shaking. I was researching it all night, there was no way I could have just gotten pregnant on my own.\n\nI was able to get blood work back first. There were no surprises: everything looked great. But when I did the ultrasound I started to have a panic attack. This was my first time having an ultrasound done on me and of course my first baby.\n\nI had no idea if the fetus was a boy or a girl, what would it look like? Who is this little being that lives inside of me? Where did it come from?\n\n\"Its okay, you don't have to be nervous. The ultrasound won't hurt.\" The doctor reassured me, with a smile. I chuckled nervously, \"I have a silly question... have there been cases before of someone getting pregnant without having sex?\"\n\nI knew I sounded insane. I couldn't help it, it was the first time I'd ever said it aloud. I just really wanted to know. I waited for her response.\n\n\"You're pregnant.\" The Doctor said, looking at me. It seemed the doctor didnt take my question seriously, maybe she thought I was being silly?\n\n\"But, I haven't had any sex in years, not even kissing! How the hell could I be pregnant?\" I felt violated and betrayed by my body and my existence.\n\n\"Its impossible.\" The doctor said. \"Maybe something happened that you just don't remember, I hate to tell you that. I dont mean to scare you.\" She said, as she began the ultrasound.\n\n\"No, that didn't happen.\" The only people i had been around in the past few weeks where Lexi and my mom. \"Can you tell me how I'm pregnant?\" I asked the doctor. \"Your uterus is 'to go'\", she replied. Oh gee, imagine that. Oh my god this wasn't happening. \"Can you, see this, on here?\" The Doctor asked.\n\nI felt uncomfortable asking the doctor what exactly she was seeing on my uterus. There was a sudden burst of commotion, the room got quiet. The doctor was hunched over the computer screen, next to me. As she zoomed in I saw myself on a screen, one I'd never seen before.\n\nA surreal feeling had overcome me, I felt my mind come to a halt. I couldn't move, I felt like I was having a seizure. I didn't look at the doctor directly.\n\nShe kept repeating, \"it's okay, you don't have to look.\" I knew I wasn't, but I felt like I was already thinking about all the things I would tell someone if I was on the news, my parents, why am I still talking? Was this even real? Do I have to tell my mom? What do I say to my friends?\n\nI never had sex with anyone since I was 15. I never felt these sharp pains. I never was this nauseous. I started to feel incredibly scared and knew I didn't have long to figure this all out.\n\nThat doctor's expression changed. \"Well, its a girl. She's healthy and oh yea, in two weeks, I think you might go into labor.\" You have got to be fucking kidding me! Oh my god, this has got to be a joke. I wouldn't let myself feel how scared I was. At that moment I actually felt like this was the reality of it all.\n\nThat night was the longest night of my life. I couldn't sleep.\n\nI laid in bed and stared at the ceiling. After midnight I had a contraction, which felt nothing like what I had read in books. The hard part is believing it. There had to be a large difference between the doctor's over dramatic description and a labor contraction.\n\n\"Heaven is leaking fluid from her womb.\" My over active imagination supplied them. How unbelievable it was that I was having a baby, giving birth to a girl, when it was impossible for me to.\n\nThat night was the worst. The contractions lasted for three hours and they felt like they were ripping through my body. I had panic attacks and I tried breathing with no control. I fought to breathe in through my nose but had to take in huge gulps of air, just to breathe out once it was all over.\n\nThe entire three hours I continued to stare at the ceiling. I called the doctor the next morning and asked her to come in to confirm her words. At the Doctor's, I had another contraction, and another confirmation that it was indeed a true labor sensation.\n\nHowever, after my doctor left the room, I collapsed on the ground gasping for air. I was panicking. My doctor rushed back in the room, \"We need to go to labor and delivery to get your whole labor checked.\" she said. I continued to cry the entire ride.\n\nI already felt like a burden, I didn't want people constantly asking me questions about what had happened to me. At the hospital, I threw up everything. \"I think I have had an episode.\" I said to the nurse when she came in to see me.\n\n\"I'm going to keep you for observation tonight.\" The nurse's expression said, \"stay strong, we have to do this, it's the best for the baby.\" I felt alone and humiliated.\n\nI knew this wasn't the end of it and knew in the long run everything would be okay.\n\nI just wished I knew what was going on during the car ride to the hospital, or why I was pregnant when it looked like I hadn't had sex in over 5 years. I laid in the bed of the emergency room, wondering who or what had impregnated me? Why was I living a nightmare? Why had my life turned into a mystery?\n\nI slept for most of the night, tossing and turning. I started to be more and more terrified. How was I going to do this.\n\n\"Is there a way you can figure out who's the father?\" I asked the nurse when she came to do her rounds. \"We could do a DNA test, and hope the results come back quick.\" She suggested, as she looked at me.\n\n\"Are you in the testing business?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course I'm in the business. That's why I'm here.\" She said.\n\n\"I can't be pregnant. I need to know who the father is, how this is happening.\" I said.\n\n\"They'll put in a urinalysis test tonight and take a few blood samples and we'll get results tomorrow.\" She said.\n\n\"Thanks.\" I said. \"Can I ask who did this to me?\"\n\n\"No idea.\" She said. \"We have so many stories like yours. It's not a big deal.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you.\" I said\n\n\"We'll get you some in-depth testing as soon as we have it. I'm very sorry.\"\n\nI don't remember much after that. I went to sleep. It was then that I knew I was trapped. There was no way to get out, this was my life now. I've never felt so alone, scared, or humiliated.\n\nThe thought of doing anything, or trying to find the person who did this to me was unbearable. What if I can't find out who did this to me?\n\nThe next night I sat there, listening to other people on the floor just screaming and crying. I cried myself to sleep that night.\n\nIn the morning, the nurse came in with a crinkled piece of paper in her hand.\n\n\"We got the DNA test results, I have some strange news.\" I waited anxiously for her to respond.\n\n\"There was no DNA aside from your own.\" She said. It sounded crazy, how was there no other DNA? How was there no father of my child? I was pregnant... but by what? I couldn't have gotten myself pregnant.\n\n\"Wait, there's no father to the baby?\" I asked. \"So what's growing inside me?\" I said. \"We're not entirely sure, I'm so sorry.\" She said.\n\n\"We're gonna keep you here for the night to keep an eye on your swelling and bleeding.\" She said.\n\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"Can you tell me who impregnated me but apparently hasn't left any DNA behind?\" I said. \"Is there a chance you can figure it out?\" I asked.\n\n\"It may be possible, but it'd take some time.\" She said.\n\nAt this point, I couldn't imagine there was any other way of doing this. There were no answers to be given, there were no doctors or nurses who would help me escape the prison I was trapped in.\n\nThat night, after I finished a few tests, and laid in the bed I was given, I stared at the ceiling, utterly depressed. As I lay there, I could feel the tears flowing down my face. I kept my eyes closed, waiting for the heartbreak to come.\n\n\"Wow, hard to put this in words.\" I said to myself. I got up out of bed, and went over to the mirror. My face was so swollen from crying, and with each tear that ran down my face, my skin turned red and flushed. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed.\n\nI could feel fat forming on my face. All the natural bone underneath had all but disappeared. What was this, what was happening to me? What if I ended up looking like one of the girls on those crazy diet pills, and none of my friends would talk to me anymore?\n\nI could only hope that I could find out the person who impregnated me. Maybe one day they'd tell me.\n\nI laid back in bed, and cried for a while. I was woken up in the middle of the night by nurses, and a doctor. \"Sorry for waking you... we require to do another blood test.\" The doctor said in a stressed out tone, he scanned my whole body and face up and down with a worried look.\n\n\"Do you feel okay?\" He asked. My whole face felt numb, it was terrifying. \"I don't. Why do you need to do another blood test? Is something wrong?\" I said, looking at the doctor. \"We where reviewing the ultrasound, and... we noticed something looks... wrong.\" He said, quietly.\n\n\"What!?\" I yelled, trying to move my body. \"So you're saying... It's deformed, or not human...? What are you implying?\" I screamed, the tension and fear was gone from my body, I felt a burning curiosity building inside me.\n\n\"What are you saying... I'm pregnant, I got pregnant by someone, but they didn't leave any DNA behind, and... it's deformed?\" I said. I looked around the room, and it felt surreal, I felt as though I was surrounded by mirrors.\n\nMy body was changing again, my skin lost its smoothness, and things started to look out of place, my clothes were ill fitting, they were starting to look more like pajamas, and less like clothes. \"Would you tell me what you're talking about?\" I said, losing confidence in the doctor.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what you say, it's too late for an abortion.\" He said, almost embarrassed. \"I think you better keep it, considering what kind of condition it's in.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? Can't you just cut it out of me?! When is the labor suppose to happen?\" I said, feeling an aching in my insides. \"Based off of the tests we've done on the individual inside of you... we realized if we take the thing out of you surgically, you could die.\" He said. \"Wait... you just said 'the thing'... What is it?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's-\" He began to speak, he hesitated and then began to sob.\n\n\"It's a... the test results stated that, it's... a clone.\" He said, his words forming a screech on the last. He panted, trying to regain his composure. \"A clone...?! What the hell!\" I shouted, feeling scared. \"I can't imagine the pain you must be going through...\"\n\n\"Couldn't you kill it?! Like on an IV or something?\" I asked, looking at him in confusion.\n\n\"The hospital won't do that, not in case of this situation.\" He said, shaking his head. \"There has to be a way, why did this even happen?! How did a clone form inside of me?!\" I said. I paused for a second. Something was wrong with this whole thing. Nothing made sense anymore, and the doctor... wasn't helping.\n\n\"Look... Don't worry, we're going to figure this out. The clone is growing at an alarming rate, it seems that the subject is feeding off of you causing you to feel and appear unhealthy.\" He said. \"This isn't normal, we need to find a way to get it to leave you.\" He said, sighing and placing his face in his hands.\n\nHe began to sob, and before I knew it, my thoughts were interrupted by another doctor walking into the room. I jumped a little.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" The doctor asked me.\n\n\"No, I'm not alright. Apparantly I have a clone growing inside my uterus...\" I said, feeling uncomfortable saying it out loud. \"How do you think I'm going to be okay?\" I said, in a hostile tone. The doctor put his hands up, making me stop my speech.\n\n\"What am I suppose to do? Am I just suppose to give birth to a baby version of myself?\" I asked. \"It will all be okay, you can put her up for adoption. We can move on and act like this never happened.\" The doctor reassured me.\n\nI felt uneasy, like I was hallucinating or dreaming this whole reality that was unfolding in front of me. I decided to try again to get some information on this phenomenon.\n\n\"...So you have no idea how the heck this happened?\" I asked. \"You don't know anything about where it came from? How did it form in my uterus?\"\n\n\"We don't know how it formed. Based off of our tests, we can not confirm the specific material in the uterus at the time of the conception.\" The doctor said. \"We'll need to check with our experts to figure out how exactly this organism came to be.\" He looked directly at me, it seemed that he was searching for an answer.\n\nHe looked at me, shaking his head in disbelief, and gave me the once over.\n\n\"Listen, this is not the time to panic. If you give birth to this organism, you and your baby will be fine.\" The doctor said, his face turning into an exasperated grimace. \"Just keep everything calm.\"\n\n\"It's not my fault that I have a clone growing inside of me!\" I shouted, anger taking over. \"If I don't get some answers, I might just have to end it all!\" I shouted. I was scared of the doctor's reply. All he seemed to do at this point was shake his head in frustration.\n\n\"Alright, I'm sure you don't want to talk about this now. Can I get back to you after you give birth? This will all be so much easier then.\" He said in a condescending tone.\n\nI banged my hand on the table, burning my palm on the metal.\n\n\"How about you let me talk?!\" I said, fury out of control. I threw my hands up.\n\n\"Listen, I am not going to sit here and wait until I go into labor to find out how my own body will be destroyed by giving birth to myself!\" I shouted. Tears were beginning to fall down my face. I knew I was showing signs of anger. I was just glad that it seemed to be getting everyone's attention.\n\nI shouted getting everyones attention. \"I didn't want this! I didn't even know i had this thing inside of me! Why am I being put in a room for days on end? it seems like you guys actually don't care.\"\n\n\"We've tried to calm you down.\" The doctor said. \"The nurses are bringing you water and something for your anxiety.\"\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\"We're trying to give you an afternoon off from the high-stress. We want you to rest up. If nothing happens overnight, we will be inducing the labor tomorrow.\"  The doctor said. I wanted this over and done with.  \n\n\"Could you induce the labor now? I'm miserable.\" I sobbed. \"I don't want this to be what my life is now. I'll do anything to have this be over.\" I asked for permission to induce the labor, and wanted my request granted.\n\nThe doctor looked at the nurses and let out a sigh, he then looked at me. \"Well, its a little risky... but we can try our best tonight.\" He said. \"Even if it doesn't work, at least we'll know we tried. At the very least, tomorrow the baby should be coming out of the birth with a clean bill of health, and it will be easier for us to talk you through why everything is happening the way it is.\" \n\nI grabbed ahold of his hand. \"Please.\" I breathed, tears dripping off of my cheeks. The doctor gave me a reassuring smile.\n\n\"We will be back shortly.\" He left the room with the nurses.\n\nAs I waited for the doctor to come back and induce the labor, i could feel movement within my stomach. It made me sick to think that somehow a clone of myself was growing inside of me... and what did they mean when they said it's growing at an alarming rate? The movement inside began to feel more like something was trying to push its way out of my stomach. It was excruciating and terrifying.\n\nI think i dozed off. Before I could even really process what was happening, the doctor entered the room. He stuck the needle of the IV in my arm. I felt dizzy as he began the process to induce labor. I felt like i was losing my concentration. He worked quickly and it began to get the baby moving. I breathed in and out. This was all very surreal, he looked at me and smiled.\n\n\"You're having the baby tonight.\" He said. The staff stood, ready to catch the baby... my clone.\n\nIt was time.\n\nI began breathing heavily, as sharp shooting pains went off in every direction inside of my body. I felt like I was about to explode. \"You're doing great. Fantastic job.\" The doctor said, as a nurse held my hand. \n\nI continued the heavy breathing, wondering if giving birth always this painful. I felt sort of out of it, the nurses where consoling me and encouraging me to keep going. \"Okay, now you have to push.\" One of them said.\n\nI began pushing with all my might to get this thing out of me. The doctor and nurses looked at me, waiting. My body finally gave it's final push. I screamed in agony, keeping my eyes shut tight.\n\nI felt woozy and on the verge of unconsciousness. Everything below the waist felt like it was torn apart, and shredded. The pain left a burning sensation.\n\nThe room went silent.\n\n\"What the fuck?!\" I heard the doctor yell. \n\nI opened my eyes the best i could, and what i saw... it took my breath away. \n\nI was speechless and stunned.\n\nLaying at the foot of the bed in a fetal position was what I had just given birth to, A fully grown twenty three year old clone of myself.",

        "text": "TW: Abuse, Blood\n\nI wasn’t dealt a good hand in life as a child. My father was the sole breadwinner, sloughing away till dead in the night for meagre wages, while my mother gave up her job as a kitchen assistant to take care of me - a pale, feeble baby plagued with constant bouts of fevers and whopping coughs.\n\nPoverty was the theme of our interior design, paint peeling off the walls and mismatched second-hand furniture scattered around, save for a single antique floor mirror. Its bronze grandeur was always hidden behind a tattered old blanket, but whenever my curiosity got the better of me and I tried peeking at it, my mother would come rushing to smack my tiny hands away.\n\nThe usual “Don’t touch that! It’s our family’s heirloom, Aymya!” shrieks in my ear would be enough to deter me from trying again for a while. My parents ended up slipping the mirror behind our creaky cupboard for safekeeping, and similarly as I grew older, the odd furniture piece slipped to the back of my mind.\n\nWhen I was six, my family’s situation unexpectedly changed for the better. Maybe Lady Luck herself took pity on us, or maybe through sheer hard work, but either way, things were finally looking up for us.\n\nI remember toddling into our dingy kitchen and a miraculous sight greeted me. For once, our dining table had a full spread, it was a mystery how the rickety wooden legs did not snap under the weight of all the roasted meat, seafood and even dessert. My parents sat at both ends, eyes beaming with joy as my jaw dropped at the feast.\n\n“Aymya dear, your father’s business is finally taking off! No more worrying about your doctor bills and we afford your surgery!” my mother started, while beckoning me to join them. “And we can have family dinners like this every day in the future!” she continued.\n\nBeing six, I barely understood what my mother was saying, but hearing that I could spend more time with my parents meant the world to a young child like me. With a delighted squeal, I scampered across the room and jumped into my mother’s arms.\n\nMy father then chimed in. “We will be moving into a bigger, nicer house in two days, Aymya. You will get your own pretty bedroom and a big pool to splash in when you are older.”\n\nHe then paused in contemplation, before quickly adding, “How about you start packing your favorite toys and clothes right after dinner? We don’t have much time to move.”\n\n“Okay daddy! I will! I can’t wait to moveeeee!” I eagerly promised in a singsong voice as I wolfed down my dinner, no longer able to sit still and contain the excitement bubbling within me.\n\n*Well, apparently, they were not kidding about having no time.*\n\nWhen moving day rolled about, I scrambled out of bed the moment the warm, golden rays hit my face. Turning to my left – where my parents usually slept in the corner of the room we shared, I stopped short. Gone were my parents and gone was their bed and clothes that were usually strewed all over the floor.\n\nTaking their place was a full-sized doll house, an entire mahogany bookshelf of children’s books and a full walk-in closet filled with beautiful dresses in all colors imaginable.\n\nFor a moment, I thought I was dreaming, but as I was backed off in horror, I stumbled and fell, yelping out in pain. Within seconds, my parents rushed in with worry plastered across their faces.\n\n“Aymya! Are you okay, sweetheart? Did you hurt yourself anywhere?” my mother cooed as she spun me round, fussing and checking for injuries.\n\n“Mom..? Dad? What is going on?” I whimpered, completely bewildered by the foreign surroundings. “W..what is this place?”\n\nA hint of apprehension flickered as my parents exchange a quick glance, before my dad sat me down at my now – silky, feather-soft bed.\n\n“Aymya, you were sleeping so soundly that we did all the moving. Sorry kiddo, but at least you get to enjoy our new home the moment you wake up, right?” my father said, disquiet well-concealed behind a faint smile.\n\nAs disappointed as I was, my six-year-old self was quickly placated with a little coaxing from my parents and a pinky promise to bring me out for dinner. Within minutes, I was running through the hallways of my new house, exploring every nook and cranny.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWith sufficient funds and better living conditions, soon my health was in the clear and I started school. Although it was generally fun and I made many new friends, my grades were nowhere near stellar. Initially, my teachers made me join extra classes and my parents sent me for tuition, but it barely improved.\n\nSoon, it became apparent that I had a problem grasping languages. Over a teacher-parent meeting, my principal suggested that my parents brought me to see a professional child psychologist, to determine if I had any learning disabilities. I was a hardworking kid, always attentively listening in class and handing in my homework, but somehow my efforts would never reflect in my exams.\n\nSure enough, after a couple of assessments, I was diagnosed with dyslexia.\n\nI was always mixing up the letters in the alphabets, and I could barely discern the words that form a sentence. Whenever I stare words, the letters seem to come alive and they start dancing around, completely confusing my brain. Apparently, the most common letters that dyslexic individuals get muddled up with was ‘d’ and ‘b’, which was exactly what happens to me.\n\n“Don’t worry, Mr &amp; Mrs Smith. Since we discovered Aylya’s dyslexia early, I am confident that we can come up with an effective approach to help her overcome it. The success rate is quite high, with many dyslexic individuals turning out to be competent readers.” my psychologist assured, my parents nodding in silent agreement.\n\nMy psychologist was right. Within a few years of training, monetary and mental support from my parents, my grades vastly improved, and I was at least passing every subject in school. Nothing valedictorian-worthy, but it was still a great achievement considering my condition.\n\n*Not that it really mattered – I led an almost perfect picture life, a true reflection of what my parents have worked and sacrificed for me.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was as usual, studying late at night while my parents went out for their anniversary dinner, when a heard a soft wail. I looked around, wondering if it was my neighbors or the stray cats that roamed around outside our estate. Deciding to ignore it, I continued burying my head in my books.\n\nThe next moment, the wail escalated into a full-on shriek, it was muffled, but it sounded like coming from above.\n\n*The roof?*\n\nConcerned and already distracted from my studies, I decided to investigate.\n\nI went out of the house and headed to the front yard, tipping my toes, trying to catch sight of anything on the roof.\n\n*Nothing.*\n\nBut the pandemonium was getting louder. The echoes of a frenzied cry reverberated around the walls, with the tinkling of glass shattering and furniture crashing against each other conjuring the eeriest orchestra.\n\nI went back into the house again, trying my best to locate where the sounds were coming from. The noise felt far away while I was outside, but it got louder and closer the moment I walked in.\n\n*Weird.*\n\nTiny goosebumps covered my trembling arm as I cautiously wandered around the house, silently treading, and gripping my phone close. The ruckus got louder and louder, and I finally stopped right beneath my attic.\n\n*It’s here.*\n\n‘Are there burglars up there?’ was my first thought, but it didn’t made sense. The attic was locked shut, and it could only be opened from the outside. There was no way someone would have gone up and locked themselves in.\n\n*Maybe a stray animal that got in from tiny window?*\n\nAt the thought of this, I calmed down. I released the stairs and started to make my way up, half anticipating a squirrel or wild skunk to jump out.\n\nWhen I finally hurled myself up into the attic, it was in complete darkness aside from a small stream of moonlight. Boxes of old toys, photo albums and trinkets were carelessly littered around, accompanied by glints of cobwebs hidden in the dark corners.\n\n*How much memories and secrets has been hidden away here?*\n\nA sudden, inhumane scream from the darkest corner jolted me out of my thoughts. Under the soft glow of moonlight, I saw a glimpse of metallic shine peeking out.\n\nFumbling on my phone to switch on the torchlight, the view of a bronze mirror from my childhood appeared in my peripheral vision. It was still shielded with a dusty old fabric, but this time, the bottom half was uncovered, with slight cracks running along the surface.\n\nI bent down to take a closer look, yearning to satisfy my childhood curiosity. The old piece of junk is already broken, I doubt my parents will mind me sneaking a glance.\n\n*It’s not like I can destroy it any further, right?*\n\nAs I scooted closer and grabbed the cloth covering the mirror, I slowly lifted it, and all I could hear was my heart pounding against my ribcage and the soft rustling of the fabric unfolding.\n\nA Y M Y A\n\nMy name was carved onto the mirror.\n\nNot just carved, but carved from the inside. The surface on the outside was completely smooth, but my name was encased within. No, it wasn’t just a custom design. The carving was done haphazardly, with pure hatred and rage.\n\nA silent scream bubbled up to my throat, but before I could even process what was going on, another ear-splitting screech emitted from the mirror and all of a sudden, my own reflection was gone and a pair of eyes appeared.\n\nMy eyes.\n\nGlaring back at me.\n\nI stumbled back, hands trembling uncontrollably as I tried my best to crawl towards the exit.\n\n“AY…AYMYA”\n\nA low guttural voice croaked from within the mirror. My head whipped back at my name out of habit, and slowly, a face started to form, the upper body, then an entire figure.\n\nSquinting my eyes to refocus my vision on the mirror again, my body turned ice cold. I finally realized what, or who I was looking at.\n\nMyself.\n\nHer soft facial features, caramel brown eyes, and button nose, it was me without a doubt. As unnerving as it is, I could not pull my eyes away. It was like looking in a mirror – sort of, literally.\n\n*“W..WE’VE FIN…FINALLY MET, AYMYA.”*\n\nThe other me drawled out, her voice like nails scratching against a board. She gave a slow, lopsided grin, revealing a bloodied set of gums with just a few teeth hanging on.\n\nHer hair was bald in patches, the remaining strands so heavily matted and clotted in red, I could barely see our natural color beneath.\n\nAs she dragged herself out of the silvery vortex, I could only stare, completely frozen in place.\n\nOne of her eyes was also glazed white, barren from any eyelashes, and her ears were both missing, replaced with just tiny holes that were sewn shut.\n\nIt was a mad scientist worst Frankenstein imitation of me.\n\n“Y..YOU..YOU TOOK MY LIFE! MINE!”\n\nI snapped out of my trance and back to my reality, or nightmare.\n\n“Who are you? What happened to you?” I barely managed to squeak out.\n\nShe glared at me with her good eye, and tears started welling up as she shook her head in fervent contempt.\n\n“WHO? I AM YOU. YOU TOOK MY PLACE.”\n\nMy mind was swirling, nauseousness and panic hitting me like a tidal wave. I tried to steady my breathing before I meekly stammered, “W..what do you mean?”\n\nIn a painfully slow manner, she straightened up, hobbled towards me, and hissed in my face.\n\n“You took my life. You stupid, sick bitch, that’s what I meant. You took my life, my home, my parents, EVERYHING!”\n\nWiping away tears with an almost skeletal hand, she continued.\n\n“You should have just died! In order to save you, you fucking ill shit, your father turned to evil and opened the mirror portal. Murdered my parents. Shot them in cold blood to save his poor little daughter.”\n\nShe paused, slowly caressing my face, as if admiring it.\n\n“I would have looked like this…if not for your FUCKING FATHER! All I wanted was what was MINE. MY LIFE. But he shackled me in this trash of a house, fed me scraps from your leftovers. Every time I tried to escape; he took a little more of me. First, my hair. Then, my tooth, my ears, and my eye. Told me that only his little darling AYMYA mattered.”\n\nInching closer, until we were face to face, she looked straight into my eyes and sneered.\n\n“He wanted to make sure that I will never be able to replace you.”\n\nParalyzed with a mixture of utter fear and shock, it suddenly dawned on me. The puzzle pieces were coming together. It was never my father’s ‘business’. The hurried ‘moving’, the money, and…my dyslexia?\n\nIt was never dyslexia. I was just reading everything…\n\nMirrored.\n\nMy eyes widened as I crashed onto the cold attic floor in realization.\n\n*We took over another family’s life. My parents are murderers.*\n\n*The same people that refused to hurt a fly, that ferried me back and forth doctor appointments and…sacrificed everything for me.*\n\n“BUT I AM AYMYA TOO.” she screeched as she lunged at me, clawing, and smashing my face in.\n\n*My parents sacrificed everything for me. Now it is my turn to be a good daughter.*\n\nWith this, I pushed her off with all my might, and grabbed a stray wooden plank stuck in one of the boxes. Extending my arm as far as possible, I swung my makeshift weapon right across her head. As she staggered back from the pain, I continued thrashing, aiming at lethal spots, until she was left spasming and gurgling on the floor. Hoisting myself up, I grasp a shard of broken wood and stabbed her in the chest.\n\n*It’s over, I’ve won.*\n\nLimping out of the attic, blood smeared over me, I broke into a smile, knowing that my parents will be proud of me. No more worrying about a psychotic clone of me coming after us.\n\n“HOLY SHIT AYMYA!” a sharp scream rang from the hallway, followed by a deeper voice, “HONEY, GO GRAB AYMYA FROM HER ROOM AND MAKES SURE SHE DOESN’T SEE THIS MONSTER.”\n\n*Monster?*\n\nStaggering towards the voices, my vision started to blur. My entire face felt like it was on fire, and I almost gagged from the metallic taste lingering in my mouth.\n\n“Mom? Dad…?” I whimpered, leaning against the wall to prop myself up. As I continued to hobble forward, I felt myself fade in and out of consciousness.\n\nAs I stopped to steady myself, I glanced up, and in front of me, was the hallway mirror.\n\nThe last thing I saw was my reflection. Bald patches in my hair, a bloodied and bruised mouth with missing teeth, and one empty eye socket with warm, red liquid oozing out.\n\nThe last thing I heard was my dad yelling as a gunshot rang, “DIE, BITCH! GO BACK TO WHERE YOU BELONG.”\n\nɘm ƨyoɿƚƨɘb ƚi ɘƨuɒɔɘd ƚud ,ƚi yoɿƚƨɘb ƚ’nɒɔ I ƚɒʜƚ ƚon ƨ’ƚI  \nAYMYA",

        "text": "Hello, I'd like to start by saying that I'm someone of a sound mind and have never shown signs of any mental disorders and have seen a therapist and have been deemed mentally sound, so what the hell did I just bring into my life. \n\nTwo weeks ago I went to a yard sale, a small hobby of mine when I have the extra money to spare. I'm a soon to graduate highschool student with a part-time job and the occasional spare change. When I was out looking to see what there was, one yard sale caught my eye. They had lots of furniture and tables full of goodies. Another thing about me is that I go camping frequently and am always looking for interesting camping supplies or replacements for any of my current gear. So, when I spotted a tent still in it's box I was excited! I brought it up to the lady running the yard sale, she was perhaps about 50 years old or so. I asked her why she was getting rid of a perfectly good tent for such a cheap price(it was about $15). She told me that it had only been used once and that she hasn't been camping often since her knee replacement surgery. I thought that was pretty valid but still questioned the cheap price. She said she just wanted to get rid of it and didn't desperately need the money. Just looking to clean out her home. In all honesty, I had already assumed she was wealthy from the home she was living in, so I accepted this answer and paid her the $15. \n\nA few days after I bought the tent, I decided to test out the tent and some other new gear I had gotten for some winter camping and take a hike. The weather was gorgeous even it was cold with a thin layer of snow that coated the ground. I was just excited to be back out in the peace of the woods with few hikers to disturb me. Not many people around here did winter hikes and I loved the peace that came with it. Now looking back on it, I do kind of wish there was someone else around me to maybe have an excuse for what happened next. \n\nAfter a while I had set up camp and pitched the tent. I was ready to settle for the evening and crawled into the tent and into the warmth of my sleeping bag, bundled up and drifting off. Sooner than I had realized, it had gotten late and, of course, dark. I had woken up suddenly, don't really remember why and it's not a common habit of mine. Something felt off. At first I wanted to shove it off as just being alone camping but something in my gut sank the longer I sat in the silence. I sat up, searched for my headlight, and turned it on. I figured if I just took a peak outside I would be fine. I opened the zipper and...jeez it just turns my stomach recalling this...but I was somewhere else entirely. I didn't recognize a single thing around me and thought maybe I was just dreaming. It didn't take long for me to realize that I in fact wasn't since I was still aware of how my face burned from the cold. I debated stepping out of the tent into the new surrounding but curious got the best of me and made the worst mistake. As soon as I stepped out the tent disappeared. I was lost surrounded by the same tall, bare trees and thick white snow. I couldn't see much with the little light the headlamp gave off. I spun around looking for anything that seemed familiar. I could hear my own heartbeat in the silence and panic of the moment, god it could outbeat a rabbit's. \n\nI walked forward a little and spotted some sort of trail. There weren't any human footprints on it so no one had used it recently from what I could tell. A trail was better than nothing and had to lead me somewhere eventually. I got to the trail and followed it until I eventually recognized a familiar area. My campsite. How the hell had I ended up a 30 minute  walk from my campsite?! Where had my footprints gone from before?! I approached my campsite and there it was. My tent. Confused and still tired, I chopped it up to just simply that, being tired. Maybe I had just imagined the whole thing. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night...\n\nOnce I got home I told my father of what had happened when I went camping. He assured me it was nothing and I had probably dreamt it  and sleep walked or something. That I was overreacting. It felt to real to have just been a dream but I didn't want to think of what else it could have been. Some elaborate prank? Some forest ghost? Who knew but I didn't want to know. I tried to forget about it until it happened again. I went to a different location with the same...damn...tent. It happened again. All of it. \n\nI woke up thirty minutes away from my campsite. The tent disappeared from me and I had to find my way back in the dark. This was starting to freak me out and instead of staying I just packed up and went back to my car. I barely managed to sleep in the car for the night and drove home the next morning. I didn't even bother to tell my dad what happened, assuming I would just get the same answer. That I had been sleep walking and dreaming.\n\nI don't know what to think anymore. I don't drink and I don't do drugs. As I mentioned in the beginning I have been deemed sane by a therapist and feel like no one believes me.  I don't know what to do but I'm not touching that tent again. I have a feeling...as crazy as it sounds...its cursed. I know that sounds crazy and I don't really believe in that kind of stuff but I don't know what else to think. I'm thinking about just burning the tent or something. I don't want this thing in my house and my family thinks I'm just overreacting.",

        "author": "HeadOfSpectre",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyrhwx/der_mampf/",
        "text": "When I was a little boy, my mother used to tell me stories about Der Mampf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was sort of a local boogeyman in the town I grew up in. A spooky story for parents to tell their kids. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one she most often told was about a little boy named Stefan, who was a very loud and lively child. Stefan liked to play from the moment the sun rose until long after it set and though his mother and father would often tell him that he needed to go to bed, Stefan would not. When they tried to tuck him in, he would wait until they had left before creeping out of his bed and playing with his toys once again until the noise he made caused his parents to come and put him back to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time, Stefan had asked his mother why she insisted he be asleep by dark and she had told him that if he remained awake and continued to play, then he risked drawing the attention of Der Mampf. \n\n  *‘Der Mampf is a terrible creature.’* She’d said to him. *‘He lives in the forest, and comes out at night looking for something to eat. He has no eyes, so he listens for loud sounds and follows them back to their source.’* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  *‘Why do they call him Der Mampf?’* Stefan had asked, *‘That sounds like such a silly name!’* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  *‘They call him Def Mampf because he is the man with ten thousand teeth. When he bites into your flesh and begins to chew, the agony never stops. As your body slides down his gullet piece by piece, those teeth crush and mush you into a pulp. He starts with your feet, then he bites off your legs. He’ll swallow your arms, and tear you in half. Then before he eats up the rest of you, he takes out your teeth and adds them to his own mouth.’*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, little Stefan still thought the whole story sounded silly so he didn’t pay it any mind. He decided that his mother was simply trying to scare him and he didn’t want to change his ways. So the next night, he behaved the same as he always did. When he was put to bed, he got up and played with his toys. He did the same the night after that, and the night after that, and the night after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen one night, when Stefans mother heard a commotion in his room, she went to put him to bed once again, only to find no trace of her son. Only an open window, a pool of blood on the ground, and the distant sound of chewing.\n\n*‘Mampf. Mampf. Mampf.’*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat story used to scare the crap out of me when I was little. I’d always go to bed, wrap myself in my sheets and never make a sound after being sent to bed, terrified that if I was somehow too loud, Der Mampf would crawl through my bedroom window and eat me alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to think it was a story a lot of people told to their children, but in reality, I rarely hear any mention of it outside my hometown. There are a few neighboring towns who are familiar with the story of course, but that’s really it. Mention it anywhere else and people won’t know what you’re talking about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can’t help but envy them a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost people in my hometown don’t actually believe in Der Mampf. But every now and then, you’ll run into someone who will swear up and down they’ve seen it for themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a police officer in my town by the name of Hans Blümel. I actually remember Blümel from when I was a little boy, he seemed a good enough man and I don’t think there was anyone in town who ever actively disliked him. I recall that when he was injured in the line of duty, people went out of their way to support him and his family, cooking them meals and offering to help however they could. They went out of their way to help him… The only thing they wouldn’t do was talk about how he got injured.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost people simply said that he’d been injured during a fight with a thief he’d caught trying to enter somebody's house. Another officer had found him during the altercation and chased off the assailant, although by then they’d already gouged out poor Blümel’s eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for what happened to the unknown assailant, whose house they’d been trying to break into or any other details… Those were just never really addressed. In fact, I’ve asked around and nobody remembers if they ever caught the person who injured poor Officer Blümel… And Blümel himself never said much about the whole affair until recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter his wife passed away, Blümel started hitting the bottle a lot harder than he had before and when he was drunk, he started to talk. People mostly dismissed the things he said as the drunken ramblings of an aging former police officer who probably wasn’t all there in the head anymore. But when I ran into him a few weeks ago, I held on to his every word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way Blümel tells it, he’d been called to a farm on the edge of town regarding some sort of disturbance. The owners had thought that there was some sort of animal in the barn and Blümel had gone to investigate. He’d sent his partner to watch the other entrance while he went inside to try and scare whatever it was out into the open. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, he never told me exactly what it was that he saw inside… In fact, he outright refused to describe it. The only thing he told me about it was that:\n\n  *“It took my eyes.”* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlümels screams had drawn his partner to his aid, and he told me that he remembered hearing gunshots, and feeling the creature run away. After that, he had blacked out. I had pushed Blümel a little, hoping that he might tell me more about just what it was he’d seen that night… After all, chances are it was the last thing he ever saw. He’d only laughed at me, and spoken two words:\n\n  *“Der Mampf.”*\n\nI got nothing else out of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would’ve spoken to his partner, who at the time had been a man named Friedrich Decker, but Decker is long dead. He passed away about two months after he saved Blümels life, during some sort of hunting accident. The only thing I was able to learn about that accident was that he’d been mauled by some kind of wild animal, a fact I do find a little suspicious, but hardly conclusive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suspect that some people in town think I might be a little mad, for looking into this sort of thing. After all, Der Mampf is just a bedtime story. Something that parents tell their children at night… And the strange deaths that sometimes occur around town, the mauling of Officer Blümel, the unsolved disappearance of Stefan Scharf in 1931… They’re all just coincidences. Horrible things happened, yes. But not proof of anything unnatural! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOfficer Blümel was attacked by a wild boar who got into a barn. Officer Decker was probably killed by a different boar. They’re certainly common enough in the region. Stefan Scharf was likely just a runaway who got turned into a local folk tale and my parents died during a home invasion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes… A home invasion…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the official explanation. Murdered by an unknown assailant during a burglary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I know the truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust like Officer Blümel. I saw him with my own eyes, only unlike him, I managed to get away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother and father were very much in love and it wasn’t uncommon for them to leave me at home for a night out. When I was young, they’d usually leave me with a relative for the night, but as I grew older they saw no issue with leaving me at home to care for myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was around 15 the night they died. They’d been out on one of their date nights and had come home lively and a little drunk. I’d gone to bed at my usual time, since I had school the next morning but they’d stayed up to talk and laugh like a couple in their twenties… I didn’t think they were being that loud. But, I suppose they were loud enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember a few moments of silence, followed by the sound of my mother screaming and the sound of shattering glass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’d sat bolt upright in bed, listening to my parents scream in terror. I could hear the crash of furniture being thrown around, followed by the most agonized screech I’d ever heard… Likely from my father… That scream seemed to cut off suddenly, and in its aftermath, all I could hear was the horrified sobbing of my mother, followed by her own screams and pleas for mercy before she too fell silent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’d stood silently in my bedroom, heart pounding like a drum as I listened to the silence… And started to hear the sound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*‘Mampf. Mampf. Mampf.’*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the sound my mother used in her story. The sound of chewing. Translated into English, it would more or less be the same as: *‘Munch. Munch. Munch.’*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe actual sound isn’t something I think I can properly describe… It was a wet, heavy chewing accompanied by the snapping and crunching of bone and the squish of crushed meat… At the time, it made me sick to my stomach and the memory of it still causes my guts to churn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’d opened my door and stepped out into the hall before creeping to the banister to look downstairs. I only caught a glimpse of it from the side and only just for a moment… A leathery thing that was shaped like a man, but bore no other resemblance to one. Its limbs were long and spindly, sort of like a frogs. The skin was like tanned dry leather. The palms of its hands were covered in broken jagged teeth. I could see a mouth full of countless little teeth, running all the way down its massive gullet…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I could see my mother, her legs torn from her body and disappearing down the maw of the thing that stood over her. Her eyes were still open and fresh blood dribbled from her open, now toothless mouth. I saw her chest violently rising and falling as she bled out and in her final moments, she looked at me, her eyes wide with a terror I cannot even begin to describe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, I may forget the beast. But I will never forget the look in my mother's eyes as she lay ripped apart, waiting to be devoured. The sight of her was too much for me…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI watched the creature grab her by the torso, hooking the teeth embedded into its hands into her flesh, and drag her toward it. I saw it begin to stuff her down its throat, and I heard the sound of her flesh squishing as it chewed her with a horrible, undulating motion. I could see its neck pulsating as it crushed her and I could hear her garbled, miserable cry of pain as it ate her alive. I couldn’t watch any more… All I could do was turn and run, and as I did I saw the creature's beady black eyes move slightly to focus on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTears streaming down my cheeks, I ran back to my bedroom and slammed the door behind me, blocking it with a chair and praying to whatever God might listen that it wouldn’t find me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt did no good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could hear footsteps on the stairs, and I could hear the sound of heavy breathing in the hall. I could feel its presence nearby. Somehow, in a way I don’t know that I can describe, I could feel it… Like a weight on the edge of my subconscious. I knew it was coming for me. I could hear its low, heavy breathing and I could hear the sickening squish of my mother's flesh as it chewed on her. I could hear bones cracking, and the weak whimpers she made as it consumed her…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew it was coming closer to my door, and so I did the only thing I could. I opened my window and climbed out. No sooner had I done so, did I hear the sound of my bedroom door flying open. In the moment before I dropped down to the ground below, looked back to see a shadow in the hall. I didn’t look back again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night, I woke up a neighbor by pounding on their back door until they answered. They called the police for me, who found only blood. Nothing else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe buried empty caskets, and they concluded that my parents had been killed during a home invasion. I was sent to live with my grandfather and that was that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t talk about what I saw very often. Most people in my town don’t believe in Der Mampf and long ago, when I tried to tell them the truth, they dismissed it, writing me off as nothing more than a poor, traumatized boy who’d just lost everything. But I remember all too clearly what I saw that night and I know now that I am not the only one who has seen it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will keep digging. Hopefully, if I dig deep enough I might be able to find out what it truly is, where it came from, and maybe even how to kill it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne way or another, I will force this bedtime story to its happy [ending.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)",

        "text": "Hi, I am Em, and this is not just a sad story. So I have been in love with him for over 25 years. He was always there for me and took care of everything that I wanted. He taught me how to love unconditionally and how to fall in love with myself. But like every happy and supportive person, he left me after 25 years of my life, of being together. He died just before the covid outbreak and left a hole in my heart. For the first fifteen days, I had no idea that he had already left me as I was in a quarantine center all by myself. After I was released from the quarantine center, my mother gave me the news that the person whom I loved the most is no more. I don't want to get into the details of the pain but imagine someone drowning in the same lake over and over again, for three years. I still see him, though. I still feel his presence. Sometimes, I see him standing in the dark corner of my room smiling at me with dark hollow eyes. He comes to visit me in my dreams. Mom says that it's not good for my health that I have been seeing a dead person for so long and I can't stop seeing him. In fact, I don't want him to go away. According to my mom, it's the bad spirits that have taken over his body and now they are trying to take me from her. I see him standing while I am with friends or at a party or in a music concert. I always see him. He keeps on calling me into the other side. \"It's fun\", he says. I will not have to go through this earthly pain anymore, he assures. \n\nLast week I had a major accident and lost my senses immediately. I woke up in the hospital, seeing just him standing beside in the empty room, solemnly but with that same creepy smile. He was trying to hold my hand but it was futile. He had no physical body and I was not dead yet. He disappeared as soon as my mother entered the room. \n\nMy father never visited though. He was never there for me. He was that typical abusive, alcoholic parent that you find so easily in most households these days. It was yesterday night that my father came home drunk and started hitting my mother. I was there witnessing it. He was there too, invisible to all but me. I rushed over to help my mom but I got hit in the process. I fell down hard from the staircase. This time, he couldn't take it anymore. He couldn't tolerate the fact that someone abused me this way. I was lying down on the staircase but could see everything happening upstairs. This time he did not spare the incident. He went over to my father, held his throat and continued to choke him. My father started vomitting and even before we could help him, he choked in his own vomit and died. \n\nWhen the police came for investigation, the report came normal. They all thought he died from choking in his vomit due to excess alcohol. I was taken to the hospital, again. This time the apparition was not smiling anymore. He was just sitting there with tears in his eyes. He held my hand and said, \"My child, I want you to live long. I want you to live healthy. I will always protect you. No matter what. No matter where\". \n\nI held out my hand, trying to hold his hand. All I could manage to whisper was, \"I love you grandpa\".",

        "text": "\nIt is a nice summer day. The breeze is amazing, the smell of flowers grazed my nose, looking in the man made pond in my backyard, the trees and I mirrored back, the calm rippling water as the fish swam . . what a nice day for a hike I thought. I check the weather app too incase of any weather changes or weather alerts, my app said there was a 70% chance of light rain, which is fine with me, who doesn't love a little rain? The smell, and the feel.\n\nI live in a area surrounded by trees and nature, it is honestly such a beautiful land for living, I know the area like the back of my hand we have a set of 2 trails, a shallow creek that leads you to a beautiful opening in the mountain tops, all tide off with a Do Not Trespass sign so the land is all for me and my family and the animals. Today I made my way to trail 1, trail 1 is about a 10 mile trail all around, it circles around a small neighborhood about 4 miles out. I am familiar with a lot of people around in this neighborhood considering I walk these trails almost every weekend. There is a nice man who lives in a small blue house with a garden in his front lawn. He always waves as I'm passing by while watering his flowers.\n\nBefore I started my hike I picked up a small backpack to take with me. In this backpack I have 3 water bottles, 2 granola bars and a small pocket knife. Starting the trail with a smile on my face I was excited! The weather is perfect. I can see and hear the birds, the squirrels scrambling up the trees shaking the leaves as I pass by, and the sound of the small animals rustling in the bushes trying to hide from me.\n\nAfter a good 22 minutes into my hike I was 1 mile in, I stopped to take a sip of water and to take a short breather, I sat on the small stub that I pass by where a withered tree had used to stand but has now fallen due to a strong thunderstorm we had a few months back. While sitting I see a cute little bunny passing, how cute, how fluffy and fragile I thought, I cracked open my first water bottle with my teeth and fountained it into my mouth but that's when I heard it, a loud blood curdling scream come deep from within the woods the bunny now scared off and me standing up looking around pondered on the thought of what that might be, I can't think of any animals that live in these woods that could make such a sound.. I try to dismiss it as it may be a group of teens who found their way into the woods ignorantly ignoring the no trespassing sign.\n\nContinuing with my hike I was now nearing the neighborhood with the crunch of gravel and leaves under my feet, what a satisfying sound, until it was interrupted with that ear bleeding screech again. God what the fuck could make that noise, It was louder this time. still trying to wrap my head around what that awful noise was I continue through the woods paranoid that's when the rain starts falling. I see something in the corner of my eye, a figure as fast as lightning launching itself through the woods too fast to see and too far gone to be identifiable. maybe it was a fox? Well if it wanted to hurt me it wouldn't be running away from me. . . . right?\n\nAGAIN, that screaming sound, but this time it is near,  right behind me. It hurt. I slipped in the mud and fell to the ground as I held my ears covering them with my hands almost crying lying on the ground letting the rain hit my face. The pain.. FUCK! The pain! My ears now ringing due to that noise like shattering glass, I stood up glancing around even more paranoid than before I then took the time to look down at my hands . . blood. Blood everywhere. My ears are bleeding! and that's when I saw IT or . . well . . them in the corner of my eye, I looked up. Many figures stood in the distance behind trees watching me.\n\nTall, VERY tall, at least 9 feet each, lengthy and skinny, they are the color of a black void and their eyes . . I will never forget their eyes, they are pure white. Staring into them is giving me the most uncomforting unwelcoming feeling. It was like they want me gone, like they want me to get the fuck out. . as if this is THEIR woods and THEIR land. Their arms were long, nearly dragging the ground, their hands were claws . . sharp, oh so very sharp disgustingly long. One of them slowly started dragging their claws on the tree leaving a scratch mark and that awful screaming noise which I now know was coming from them and their unhinged mouths. One started tilting its head slowly while doing so its neck made a cracking sound. Oh. My. Fucking. God. it's neck ..  stretching and growing in length making a breaking and snapping sound as it's getting longer and taller.\n\nI had no plans to stay and try to make friends with these ungodly fucking creatures, I just want to get the fuck out. I started to run, I didn't look back. I heard the leaves and plants getting mauled through behind me as if something was chasing me. \"don't look back.\" \"don't look back!\" I repeat to myself, but I'm curious and a idiot, letting my curiosity get the best of me I turned around for a split second and that's when I saw 6 giant beastly creatures charging at me like a wolf pack chasing a small bunny, their claws digging into the dirt launching themselves forwards to get close to me. One of them hooked my shoulder with their claws dragging me down to the ground, I hit my head so hard onto the rock below me I blacked out for a second. While having wip-lash and my instinct for survival I remembered my pocket knife. shit. I forgot my backpack. I look back up and a giant creature pinning me down slowly moving in towards my face with its unhinged jaw drooling over me letting it's awful horrid breath that smells like roadkill fill my nose, this is it I know this is about to be my end, it is about to sink its teeth into me.\n\nAt this point i’d do anything to just survive. I am not about to be this things dinner, I bent my knees into my chest and kicked the creature in the stomach, during the creatures confusion and vulnerability it loosened its grip of me and I managed to get one of my arms free I started to jab it in the sides with my fists and started to scratch at its eyes, it shreeked in pain and let go of me. I scrambled up and bolted back through the woods finally making it to the small neighborhood.\n\nI ran upto the old man gardening and begged him to help me, he hurried me inside, caterered my wounds, and let me rest in his basement on his couch. When I was feeling a little better I explained everything that had happened to him and he looked at me in horror. “i’m gonna be sick” he said holding his mouth running to the kitchen sink. I hurried over to him asking what the fuck was going on he then said to me “you saw a wendigo you’re lucky to have even made it out of its grasp.”\n\nI’m now writing this 1 year into the future and I still hear those awful screaming noises from deep within the forest, every now and then I still feel like im being watched.",

        "text": "I recently took a trip to Japan to study abroad for a semester. While there, I made many friends who told me all about the history of this beautiful country, in case I came back to visit. One thing to know about Japan is that its advanced technology and cutesy anime characters almost wholly cover up the horrors lurking in the shadows. Unfortunately, I had a painfully terrifying experience with said horrors, which is the whole point of this post.\n\nAnyways, it was a Saturday night, and my friends and I went barhopping from Kyoto to Osaka, since it's only about a 25-minute train ride. We were all pretty tipsy, fumbling and stumbling around each bar. We'd gotten thrown out of two bars by that point and were about to get thrown out again. My friends were arguing with the security guards and other tipsy people, and the mood was killed. I hadn't sobered up, but was still courteous and apologized profusely, practically dragging my friends out of the bar.\n\nAfter all of that, I called them a taxi and went on my way. I had already spent so much that night, so I decided to a 20-minute walk back to my dorm. There were still a good amount of people walking the streets, so I felt a little more comfortable. Still stumbling around, I decided to take a shortcut through a nearby park. I know what you're all thinking. *In horror movies, taking shortcuts almost always ends up with someone dying.* However, it was freezing cold outside, and the path was the quickest way to my dorm.\n\nI walked through the park with my hands in my pockets, hunched over to protect my face from the cold air. Quick footsteps could be heard from behind me. Turning, I didn't see anyone, so I pressed forward. Immediately after I turned back around, the footsteps continued. It was as if a child was running around the park barefoot. I glanced around the area, but still nothing. I turned back around, and that's when my nightmares became my reality.\n\nThere, lit up by the dim street poles, was a woman laying flat on her stomach, staring at me. From what I could see, the woman's hair was unkept and all over the place. I squinted before shouting *\"Hello?\"* The woman had no reaction, so I assumed she couldn't understand my drunken words. I tried my best to sound sober and repeated myself. \"*Hello? Why are you on the floor?\"* I took a step toward the woman, thinking she needed help.\n\nThe woman propped herself on her hands, revealing the nonexistent lower half of her body. I slowly backed away, to which she moved closer. Something on the ground sparkled next to the woman in the moonlight. I could barely make it out, but it looked like a scythe of some sort. The woman let out a husky sigh before speaking. *\"Where are my legs?\"*\n\nThe woman looked around before fixing her gaze back on me. I had no clue what to say to the woman, so I just replied *\"I don't know\".* She tilted her head at me and inched closer. *\"Do you need your legs?\"*\n\nAt that point, I was fully sober. Thoughts ran circles in my head as I contemplated what to say next. I wondered what my friends were doing, if they made it home safely, or if they were having the same encounter as I was. I snapped out of my thoughts when I realized the woman was no longer under the street poles. After some time of looking around for the woman, I felt a slight stinging pain in my thigh. I peered down, and there she was, staring at me. Blood seeped from my leg and dripped on the woman's face. Analyzing the woman, I noticed that she seemed to be a teenager, as she wore a  school uniform. In her hand was the scythe from earlier. I put two and two together and realized that she had just cut me. Her face was riddled with bruises and dirt, and her eyes were big and doll-like. *\"Do you need your legs?\"* Her voice sounded aggravated.\n\n*\"What kind of question is that?\"* I cautiously eyed the young woman as a smirk grew across her face. Within seconds, she raised her scythe in the air and slashed my leg. I immediately started sprinting for my life, as loud *pattering* sounds grew closer and closer to me. Exiting the park, I turned a sharp corner, hoping to distance myself from the girl. The little path took me back to the main streets of Osaka, but it was completely dead. Nobody was on the roads like previously, and all the surrounding billboards and lights were off. \n\nI glanced behind me, only to see the girl using her hands to get closer to me. My leg ached as I grew tired. As I continued, I recognized the area, and soon enough, My campus was in my sight. I managed to throw myself at the door, shattering it into pieces. I screamed, hoping anyone would come out and help. The girl was still a ways away from me, so I took the chance to use the elevator. Pressing the button, I grew more and more impatient. When the door opened, I saw my dorm mate staring at me in confusion. *\"I thought you were going out-\"* I shoved him and got in the elevator, pressing all of the buttons. She glanced around until her eyes fell on the girl, who smirked back at her as the doors closed. \n\nAt this point, the adrenaline had died, and I collapsed into my friend's arms. I sobbed into her shoulder as her grip on me tightened. \"*Who the hell was that, and why was she missing her legs?\"* My breathing hitched as the elevator stopped on the highest floor. We got out and met up with the floor assistant, who guided us to the infirmary to wrap the wounds on my body. I recounted my encounter with the girl to everyone in the room. *\"You've met the Teke Teke..\"* the assistant said in a soft voice.\n\nSupposedly, the young schoolgirl had fallen onto a railway line, where her body was cut in half by an oncoming train. It's told that she wanders around cities in search of her legs, and will approach people. She'll ask them questions about her legs, and depending on their answers, she'll either leave them alone or chase them, cut them in half, and take their legs. I learned that I was one of the few people that managed to escape from her.\n\nI have since left Japan and returned back to my hometown with my family. My mind to this day can't process what I've experienced, and not many people believed me when I told them. I know what I saw, and I have scars to prove it. You can choose to believe it or not, but I just wanted to put this out there in hopes that someone else has had a similar encounter.",

        "text": "I work as a park ranger in the deep South. My assistant was a member of a cult, the lone survivor of a mass suicide orchestrated to get their souls free passage onto the nearest UFO. His name is Jay Hardwick, and mine is Jay Salem. To avoid confusion, everyone just calls him Wickie and me Little Jay, even though I despise that nickname and always have.\n\nThe Little Jay thing is an old, and rather worn-out, joke, as I stand about seven feet tall. My parents were also monstrously tall, and their parents before them too, and so on and so forth, probably all the way back to the time of the Denisovans. Just like Great Danes are inbred for their gargantuan size, apparently my family followed a similar policy of foolhardy eugenics. Regardless, I prefer people to just call me Jay. The “Little” thing gets old.\n\n“Hey Jay,” Hardwick said to me, “does that look normal to you?” He pointed across the field where a two-headed black bear stared at us, blinking in bewilderment.\n\n“It doesn’t not look normal to me. Just ignore it. Rule number one of this job is to always ignore everything that doesn’t immediately threaten your life. And even some of the stuff that does, maybe.” I looked down from the bear, but Hardwick was still frowning.\n\n“He has a hat on.” I looked up, and Hardwick was right. One of the bear’s two heads had a Herbalife cap on. I frowned.\n\n“Well, that’s not against the law,” I said. “Bears can wear hats.”\n\n“Yeah, but it’s a scam,” he said.\n\n“That’s not against the law,” I said. “Americans have the right to participate in any scam they want. They call it the free market, I think. Or maybe the First Amendment. I forget the difference.”\n\n“OK, point taken… BUT…” Hardwick raised his index finger for emphasis. “...it isn’t even sunny out. Why the hat?”\n\n“Hardwick, I feel like you’re asking the wrong questions here,” I said. “Siamese twins, two-headed bears, flying saucers from outer space, these things all happen. The real question is, do I care?” I shook my head. “You need to learn the ropes of this job if you’re going to become a real park ranger like me. Rule number two: do the least work possible all the time, and maybe even less than that if you need to. Don’t make yourself look too good or people will be expecting you to do things all the time. And that comes back to rule number one, which is to ignore nearly everything strange or weird.” I tapped my nose in confidence at him. “If you do almost nothing from the start, people will expect nothing of you. Then you have nowhere to go but up!”\n\n“Yeah, but you’ve been in the same position at the same pay for ten years, so…” He shrugged. Point taken, Hardwick. I just looked back down to the magazine I was reading, some rag about Bigfoot sightings in British Columbia and how Elvis was just spotted, alive and well, in a bathroom in Guatemala somewhere. \n\nHardwick was an average looking guy, six feet tall with a manbun and pale gray eyes. He had two degrees from Stanford, but decided he would rather work here, for some reason that I had never asked him about. He currently sat in the ranger station, looking out the window, still observing the Herbalife bear. \n\nAs usual, we were understaffed, and weird stuff was happening. Weird stuff seemed to always happen when we were understaffed, almost as if the universe knew we had two people working in a hundred square mile park and could do almost nothing about any of it. Management would try to fix the problem, occasionally hire some new blood, some motivated youngsters who thought they could change the world or save the environment or whatever it is kids wanted nowadays, but as soon as they realized just how strange and dangerous the park was, most of them quit. Some of them disappeared, never to be seen or heard from again. The only exception so far was Hardwick, because he said he had seen far weirder things in the UFO cult. I’m not sure I believe him. Nothing could be weirder than Goreham Park.\n\nAt that moment, Sheriff Ames burst in the door. He was a good old boy from a plantation family, and moreover he had the strangest and most aesthetically unappealing body I had ever seen- his legs and arms were thin and emaciated, like sticks, but his gut and chest were huge. He looked like a walking barrel with four skin-colored twigs attached. I don’t even know how his legs supported his massive gut. His watery blue eyes and protuberant nose were a maze of burst capillaries from lifelong alcoholism, and his Southern drawl was so thick that even I only picked up about one word out of two that came out of his mouth. \n\n“Hey y’all,” he said, nodding his head at me and Hardwick. Hardwick turned around to face the newcomer. “You ever end up calling the DEP about those meth labs that exploded back there?” He pointed a shaky, crooked finger towards the woods.\n\nLast week, a meth lab had caught fire and started a small brushfire. Exploded was, in my book, a little bit too strong a word, but then again, I wasn’t a law enforcement agent. None of this was too out of the ordinary- meth labs were found all over the deep South, and sometimes they caught fire.\n\nWhat *was* bizarre was that the meth cook had apparently cut off his own feet, hands and head, then nailed these to random trees in a hundred foot radius around the burnt out meth lab. The cops, as usual, ruled this death a suicide. Anything they didn’t want to deal with was inevitably ruled a suicide or accident, especially if it involved someone nobody would ever notice was missing. I think all the townies knew it was a lie, but the police force was so underfunded that they had to cut corners somewhere. I respected that, and knew it was just a part of life in small town America.\n\n“Oh yeah, the Department of Environmental Protection said the whole area is totally FUBAR,” Hardwick said behind me. The Sheriff looked at him with his bleary eyes.\n\n“The Environmental guy told me it is going to take at least six weeks to clean the area,” I elaborated. “Actually, I think they have some people working down there right now. They said the toxic chemicals in the area are off the charts. Apparently, lots of dumping and…” I could tell he wasn’t listening anymore. His eyes roved around the small ranger’s shack where I currently sat and where Hardwick stood by the window.\n\n“You know what I think the problem is with these kids nowadays?” the Sheriff asked me. I thought to myself, No, but I bet you are about to tell me. “Satanism! There’s lots of creepy shit going on around here and it all boils down to Satanism. These kids have no sense of Jesus Christ, no sense of pride in our country, so they cover themselves in cat blood and smoke meth and do orgies, or, even worse, get gay married. No offense if y’all are part of any of that,” he said, motioning from me to Hardwick as if I didn’t get the insinuation. “It is for the dissolution of our once-great nation, I’ll tell you that right now.”\n\n“Huh,” Hardwick said, stroking his goatee. That about summarized my thoughts on it too. “By the way, did you ever find out more about that suicide back there?”\n\n“You mean the goddamn guy who cut his feet and hands off with a power saw?” the Sheriff asked, his eyes widening. “Well, we know he was the one cooking that crap.” \n\n“I kinda assumed that…” I said, but the Sheriff cut me off.\n\n“Second, we found traces of some weird stuff in his meth. Guess it isn’t even meth technically, though a lot of it is. But some of it was crap we ain’t never seen around here before- acetyl alpha-methcathinone this and bromo-birdiefly that and a bunch of other bizarre hallucinogens and bath salts that would send anyone over the edge, pronto. I’m guessing we are going to be seeing a lot more psychotic drug breakdowns around this here town before the week’s end, assuming that shit got out into the community.” The Sheriff shrugged apathetically at me. “Nothing I can do about it, anyway. You just gotta carry a .45 for protection. A .22 don’t do NOTHING to those nutjobs on bath salts. They laugh it off like it’s some sort of a paintball gun.” He raised his hand to the ceiling. “Word to my mother, I’ve seen it happen.”\n\n“So, you think he was sampling his own product, went insane on it, and somehow cut himself up like that with a bandsaw?” I asked, genuinely curious as to how the Sheriff would react. He leaned close to me, a subtle smell of rum or some other sweet spirit on his breath wafting over me, and whispered, as if he were confiding the answer to the mystery of life, the universe and everything else to me. Instead, he told me the most obvious statement I had heard all week.\n\n“I don’t think that was a suicide, boy,” he said, shrugging his eyebrows up and down as  he talked. “Sure, sure, a man could cut off his feet easily enough with a bandsaw, maybe the head too, but the hands? How in God’s Green Earth could he get the hands?” I shrugged my eyebrows back at him in what I hoped was a non-threatening, brotherly gesture.\n\n“Geez, I never thought that maybe he was murdered,” I said, hoping I sounded serious. “I mean, what if he gerry-rigged the bandsaw to keep running, like put a heavy band around the trigger and then fell into it with both his hands after getting his feet, then saved his head for last? Maybe someone hopped up on enough drugs could ignore the pain long enough to get through that.” Sheriff Ames shook his bulldog-like face, loose skin rippling as he looked down at the well-worn wooden counter between us.\n\n“Nah, not a sign of gerry-rigging or anything else in the area, CSI would have definitely found it by now,” he said. I had my doubts but I kept them to myself.\n\n“According to my research, law enforcement investigative techniques actually have a long history of mistakes and overall negligence, and it’s sent countless innocent people to prison,” Hardwick said behind us, perking up like he always did when rambling about a subject he knew. And he knew about nearly everything. He read a book a day, seemed to remember everything and didn’t find any subject too boring to study. “The only area of expertise where they don’t have an insanely high error rate is DNA testing, but the rest? Bite mark evidence and hair sampling and even fingerprinting? Their error rate is so high that it puts thousands of innocents into prison alone in…” Sheriff cut him off, lifting his hand up as if he were flicking away a housefly.\n\n“Look, boys, I ain’t come here to talk about studies. I don’t care, honest. It ain’t my job and I trust my men. I actually need a favor from you,” he said, looking mainly at me with a small glance towards Hardwick, as if sizing him up. Seeming satisfied with what he saw, he continued. “Do you remember where those Satanists killed that little girl?” the Sheriff asked. I nodded solemnly. “I need you to go back there and see if someone dropped something, something small, maybe just a bracelet or a necklace. We got a tip that certain undesirables are revisiting the site.” I wondered who would have given him the tip, or how they could have known who was visiting what miles in the woods.\n\nAnd I certainly didn’t know about any Satanists. From what I had seen, that little girl had been savagely killed by a monster, not a human being. And no one had ever been caught for the crime. Yet somehow the local media had known it was “Satanists” as if by magic. No one ever wanted to acknowledge that there were demons and monsters in the park, and they would attribute it to anything they could as long as they could avoid it.\n\n“Sure, Sheriff,” I said, nodding. “Hardwick and I have to go on patrols today anyway. We can stop by the area.”\n\nAfter nodding and shaking my hand, Sheriff Ames took off in his car, leaving just Hardwick and I alone in the ranger station. I turned and noticed the two-headed bear had gone. He had probably left before Ames even got there.\n\nAt that moment, the phone rang. Hardwick picked it up, tilting his head slightly. “Hello, ranger’s station, how may I help you?” he said quickly. He pulled the phone away from his ear slightly, grimacing, then handed it to me. “It’s for you.” I took it begrudgingly, holding it at arm’s length as if it was a poisonous snake getting ready to strike. But after taking a deep breath, I put it to my ear.\n\n“This is the head ranger on duty. How can I help you?”\n\n“I will eat your soul,” a deep, demonic voice said, coming through the phone at an amazingly loud, eardrum-shattering volume. “I will kill everyone you love in front of you and rip off your skin. I will burn your town to the ground, for I am the destroyer of stars, the devourer of worlds and the bringer of the dead lights. You will all tremble before me. Before I am done with you, you will…”\n\n“Sir, are you sure you have the right number?” I asked. “I mainly just clean up the trails around here.”\n\n“You dare interrupt me?” the voice screamed, making my right ear ring. I winced, pulling the phone farther away. “Listen to me, maggot, and listen closely. If you go to the spot where the girl’s sacrifice was performed, you will die. Stay far away. If you want to extend your puny life by even a single minute, you will avoid the areas we have deemed holy ground. Remember this, or today will be a day of endless torment and pain for you!” With that, the phone call ended. The dial tone seemed so quiet and serene by comparison that I forgot to hang it up. \n\n“What was that about?” Hardwick asked, curious.\n\n“Wrong number,” I said, walking the phone back to the cradle. “Alright, let’s get this over with. We need to go to the spot where that little girl died and see if we can’t help somehow.” I sighed. “I guess we better do it while there’s still daylight, as I really don’t want to be trapped out there after dark.” We grabbed some protein bars, water and a couple walking sticks, and headed out. As we got a few miles out on the packed dirt trail, mostly walking in silence and enjoying the scenery and the smell of pines and maple, Hardwick lit up a joint.\n\n“Hardwick, you should not be smoking that shit on the job,” I said. “In fact, you shouldn’t be smoking it at all. It makes you stupid, and it smells like a skunk ate another skunk then shit him out.” Hardwick shrugged, ignoring my point.\n\n“I don’t get how the Sheriff knew someone was visiting the site,” Hardwick said. “Or why he couldn’t just go himself, or send one of his cop buddies to do it. Why come to us? None of this makes any sense.”\n\n“I have a feeling that if Sheriff Ames tried to hike five miles off the beaten path, up and down all these hills, his heart would explode and that would just give us more paperwork to do. Besides,” I said, stopping to move a large branch off the trail, “we need to clean the paths up anyway. I haven’t been out this way in over a month.”\n\nAs I dragged the immensely heavy oak branch towards a deep pile of brush ten paces or so off the trail, I saw a long arm begin to snake out from behind a tree and approach Hardwick. It looked like an optical illusion at first, because the tree was only a couple feet wide but the arm that came out looked like it went on forever. By the time I noticed it, literally over ten feet of white, bony arm had extended and it was still coming out, like a massive cobra uncoiling from a tiny basket at the tune of some invisible snake charmer.\n\n“Um, Hardwick…” I said, my mouth suddenly going dry. I could only point silently while the blood drained from my face as the arm came to within inches of his shoulder. He raised one eyebrow at me as he took another inhalation off the joint, and then all Hell broke loose.\n\nThe arm grabbed him with an iron, vise-like grip and dragged him out of view so fast that he looked like nothing more than a Hardwick-sized blur to me. Behind me, the same voice I had heard on the phone began to speak.\n\n“You couldn’t wait to meet Death, to die screaming and watch your friend be torn apart, limb from limb,” the demonic voice said, incredibly deep and resonant. I felt every word shake my bones as it spoke. I turned and saw one of the most hideously deformed creatures I could ever imagine.\n\nIt stood over fifteen feet tall, with the same endless bony arms as the other one that had come from behind the tree. It was entirely naked, bone-white, emaciated and nightmarish looking in every sense of the word. Its eyes looked like pure white cataracts with a thin bluish film near the pupil. Its skin clung so tightly to its body that I could see every rib and bone that composed it. Its nose looked like the thin slit nose of a snake, and its ears were missing. But its smile was the most disturbing part- it had a grin that looked far too wide for its face, showing off dozens of bleeding, sharp little teeth. Small rivulets of blood ran down from its mouth, leaving pink streaks over the bottom portion of its entire face.\n\nFrom behind me, I heard Hardwick shout, then a gunshot. I turned and saw Hardwick holding a pistol, another creature like the one before me holding him ten feet off the ground. Its other long arm snaked out and whipped the gun out of Hardwick’s hand, sending it flying far away into the brush, and I knew we were doomed. Hardwick always carried a small .22 on him for protection, but I had nothing more deadly than a Swiss-army knife on me.\n\nThen, just as all hope left me, I heard a roar from behind me and a scream of pain from the creature that had spoken to me. Turning quickly, I saw the two-headed bear bound out of the woods and rip into the monster’s thin, immensely long leg. With a quick snapping sound, one of the heads snapped its femur, sending a bloody spike of bone out through the monster’s flesh.\n\nI heard Hardwick fall with a grunt as the other creature dropped him and began to draw forward, planning on attacking the bear. But with all of its attention on the main threat, it didn’t see me as I ran at him from the side, raising my walking stick and whacking it across the head as hard as I could. I heard a crack of bone and then the creature looked unsteady, stumbling along for a few steps, before falling. The two-headed bear quickly rushed forward and went for its throat.\n\n“Hardwick, run!” I said, pulling him up and heading back to the ranger station. I don’t think either of us have ever sprinted three or four miles so fast before in our lives. I thought at multiple points I might pass out, but we made it back to the station in record time, panting heavily and chugging water after water before slumping down against the wall. We looked at each other.\n\n“Did we just get saved by that Herbalife bear?” he asked me. I nodded, smiling.\n\n“I think we owe that two-headed bugger quite a bit,” I said.\n\n“Hell, I’ll buy it a whole steak dinner with mashed potatoes and apple crisp for dessert. He deserves it. Why do you think he saved us?” I could only shake my head, having no answer.\n\nThings continued to get weirder after that, and I know at least one of those monsters and two-headed bear survived, because I would run into them later that week. I wasn’t going to give up on being a park ranger just because of a couple near-death experiences, after all. This was my place, and I felt like I belonged to it, just like I hoped it belonged to me in some way. Later on, I would immensely regret not reaching the site of that girl’s murder, as the Sheriff had been right- there was a necklace there, and it would cause a heap of trouble later on. But that’s a story for next time.",

        "text": " \n\nI just found this a little while ago. It was something I started to write around Halloween, intending to share here. The thing is, I remember starting this story, but I don't remember ending it. Trying to remember everything is really difficult. I keep feeling like there's something more that I'm forgetting... Maybe you guys can help me? Has anyone had this happen to them before?\n\nLet me share with you and try to explain. So here's the first bit that I remember writing:\n\n&gt;I have always loved the Halloween season. I love to look for new books that give me a chill. I’m always searching for any promising titles, ones that sound interesting. I’m a bit ashamed to admit, I do often judge a book by its cover.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I found one a few weeks ago that looked really promising. It was a plain black cover, looked like maybe some sort of textured leather? The title was in a silvery ink, slightly embossed. There was this simple nature to it that really got my attention. I almost felt like I was seeing something more than I was actually seeing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyway, It was called “The Comforting Law”p̴̲̈́͑͊̊̋̇̓̅̑̉͛́́͛͘r̴̡̡̼̠͇̠̣̗̦̎̄͊͛̆́͛͜͝͝á̵̛͍͈̬̞̻̱͗̓́̉̆͒̀́͘̚ǐ̷̧̢̛͉͓̝̦̞̯̣̫͛̄͜͠s̶̥̯̣̬̝̯̟͒̒͂̕͠ȩ̵̧͍̺͔̘͕̭͓̘͈̑̉̈́̇͑͑̿̄̚͜ͅh̴̛̩̄̃̓̏͒̃̈́́̅̍͘͠e̷̹̦̰̞̜̫͙̠̗̖̒̔̾̑͒r̸̻̫̱͍̮̓̾͆̉͝ȇ̴̡̢͚̘͖̪̞̭̼̾͂m̵̡̡͕̥̼̺̼̱̙̺̼̙̭̀̍̃̿̓̒̾̌̄ͅb̵̪͉̲͎̙̥̦͉̹͈̫̥͑́̊͂̂͗͂̔̅̇́͑͌͘͠ͅͅr̸̨̞̝̪̭͕̫͇̱͍͙̎́̃̇̄̚a̶̻̜̭̙̖͉̲̹̩̲̱͈͙͋̽̈͋͊͂́̕ć̷̙̂̈̓̉̒̓̽͋e̴̢̛̖͉̯̝̫͈͙̜̰̙͋̽́̀̋́̎̃͌̈̍̀ͅw̸̡̞̜̲̺͓͇͊͗͆͒͌̒͒̐̅͌̓̈́̂̕ȩ̷̼̩̏̐̋͑̍̉̿͆̂̀͜͠ͅw̷̻̺̣͔̣̰̦̗̳̏́̈́͒̊͒́͒́́̚͝ͅï̵̡̧̛̳̝̫͚̥̪̑̎̚͠l̶̨͙̤̬̮͈̾͐̔̓͝l̴̛̺̫͖̯̻̜͉̣̗͔̦͍̫̙͓̂̓̎̒͊̎̌͊̚͘͠b̶̡̛̜̼̳͔̦̖͖̥̙̜̪̮̏̂̎͒͂̒̆̕͝ȩ̸̨̡̘̰͈͈̳̟̬̭̼̹̹̦̀́́̊̆̽́̽̅̎̊̎̕h̴̩͇̑͆̚ę̴͔̩͎̦̩̮̣͙͚̰̍̈̽͆̾͛̋͂͒̿̄̐̚l̵̨̖̞̠̠͙͍͎̏͋ͅḑ̷̧̻̬̲̼̥͙̣̱͉̟͎̌̏̈̒̄͗̄̓͊̓ͅả̸̝̦̦͇̳͓́̅͆̽̍̿͝n̸̢̢̛̻͎͉̖͖͓̞̟̦̯̝̿̄͒͜ḋ̸̨̡͖̥̻͚̞͉̳̥͎͎̳̠̋̀̐̀́̈́͠l̸̪̹̣̻̟͗̄̒͑̆͋̇̕̚̕̚͝͝ö̴̲̭̣̯̘̱͈͙͔̳̪̬̐́̏͘v̶͇̰̣̖͙̙̩̯̜̫̽͂̂̅̾̋̄̌̈̔̕͘͜ͅͅȩ̴̱̭͙̰̞͓̮̙͔͇̲͔̰̔̍̉̿̊͗͑͑̌͝d̸̢̢̨̨̡̖͚͇͖̞̰̜̩͚͉̐̌̎̀͠͝w̴͚̐͑͌̍ȩ̶̢͔̜̫͓̞͙̞̘̱̈͌̽̑̚̚ȧ̶̛̳̪͔̆̽́̅̓̌͑̆͜͝r̶̛̹̪̥̘͓̳͗͜ȩ̴̳̮̝̜̲̲̞͍͉̌͒ǫ̶͙̘̞̟̊̎̀͘͜͜n̸̗̮̽͝e̷̖̺͙̫̥̼̬̱̻̗̯̖͋̀̽̐̿͒͌͘͠ǫ̵̣̭̺͖̙̗͍̣̫̀̎̿̑̿͆̎͆͛͠ụ̷̧̼͔̟͚̼̣̘̫̼͇̌̑͌́r̷̛̛̻̯̈́̀̓͌̔̾̐̎̅́͝h̷̡̛̳̙̪̜̱̠̤̩͍̪̝̻̮̿͑́̃͆̾̚͝ͅa̵͔͕͛͋̉́́̑̍͛t̷͕̞̔̀ŕ̴̡̳̩̖̤̘̓͊̐̊̈́̇̈͗̈́͌ͅe̵͔͍̰̠̻̙͍̤͆ͅd̶̡̝͖̥͖̦͊̓̄͋̏́́̀̀̋̚b̸̧̦̙̳̞̅͋̄̊́͘̚͝ī̴̢̥̺̆̽̋̌́̋̃́̂̂͘͝ņ̶͎͖͍̝̳̟̗͙̪̼̍̀̌̅́d̷̩̈́s̴̜̖͕̔̍͗̇̾̈́́̐̋̾̈́̌ų̴͎͕̰̰̒s̶̛̫͍̈́̈́́̔͑͒͊̔̒̕͝…  \n&gt;  \n&gt;… Sorry about that… If you can’t tell yet, I’m not quite alright. That’s why I want to tell this story, I um. I will try to keep myself together for this, but my head is still messed up a bit from everything.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyway, I looked at the book, and there was no synopsis or little blurb on the back. It didn’t look that old, it even had that really nice new blood book smell. The thing was, there was something about the book… I began flipping through the first couple of pages, and… I know it sounds crazy, but it was like reading thousands of stories all at once. As though somehow I had hundreds of books in front of me, and I was reading them all at the same time. But there wasn’t any cacophony of noise, no overwhelming assault on my mind. I don’t know if I can explain it any better… Even though I felt like I could read it just fine, thinking about it or trying to explain it makes my head hurt…  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of course, it wasn’t like that when I first read the little synopsis on the web page. I mean, it still said the same stuff, but… I don’t know how or why, but it just made sense to me at the time. But I wasn’t looking at it on a website, why was there a web page… I was holding the book in my hands, but it was on the screen too? I think something was messing with my head already, as soon as I started looking at that damn book.g̶̢̢̼͍͉͈̯̭͈̪̺̦̭̓̔͒ͅè̸̘͓͚͇́͒̑̆̃̈̔̓͂̕̚t̸̨̼̙͇̲̦̿̆͋̇͌̂̕͜ö̶͈̪͖͈̣͖̻̝̞̥̰̘̲́͌́̆̾̾ͅͅu̷͈̹͕̝̿̊͗t̴̹̍̈́̈́͝ö̷͈̻̼̪́̒̓̄̒͒̽͘͜ͅf̷̺̱̞̬̟̖̭͍̞̗̓̇̌́̑̿͊̌͘̕̚͜m̵̗̣̝̽̽̃́͑͋̐̀̓̓̄̃͆̌̐͜ȳ̵͎̜̰̥̮̠̻̤͔̖̤̈́̀̈́͊͋̿̀̓̚̕̚h̵͉͉̠̳̞͍̿̉̈̉̐̇̓ẽ̷̠͉̱̰̺̺̖͕̪̟̘͈͂̈́̓͝a̸̧̱̘͕̗͉̣͑̃̒̃͛̊̀͛͗̚͠͝d̸̲̠̦̣̲̝̦͕͓̭̠͚̃͋g̶̮̯̈́̎̄̂̋̆͝e̶̡̨̱͕͕̫͈̹̥̘̺̺͌̔̍̌̓̌̏̎́̐͊̔̀ţ̶̨̻̺̻̜̦͇̤̫̣͓̀́͋ơ̶̱͎͎̱̖̥̟̤̪̼̦͇͙̠̌͊͒̔͐́̌̈́̍͊̍̅ủ̴̺̰̝͔̲̰͔̻̝͔̽͗̀̒̀̄̕t̶̡̨̗͍̥̗̪͇̪̻̬̉ơ̷̡̜̭͍͎̼͉͔̰͕͎̼͛̆̽́̓́͛̉̊͌͋͑͜f̵̜̳̯͉͕͙̰͖͖̠̉̒͋̽̂̓͘̕͝͝ͅm̵̤̹̳̀̌̋̓̈̈́͝y̴̡̨̢̛̼̤̙̣̞͉̗̫͉̠̗̆͂̈h̵̡̨̥͎͔̫̜͕̊̍̽̉ë̷̖̼̗̠̻͇͋̚ă̷̧̘̩͉͈̻͍̾͑͂́̃̈̋̃̄̓̽͋͠ḑ̷̧̭͔̲̝̄̋̃̓̈͊̒̀̎̑̃͠͠͝g̵̰̳̳͙̜͇̅̔̋̿̌̊̑̽̎̌̆̕̕ȩ̸̡͈̯͕̳̮͓͉͈͎̓̓͛͗̀ͅt̸̝͐͊̐͐̀̀͂̌͌̚͝͠o̸̡̨̢̹̦͚͍͓̖̗̹͓̔ư̶̰̘̄̌͑́̑̋̿̇̈́̃t̷̰̻͕̰̣̜̗̝͒̒̽̈̐͗͂͒́̂͛̆͘͜͝͝ó̵̡̨̧̯̱̮͓̜̽̈́́̓́̚͘͝͝f̸̛̗̰̭͊͆̆̿̎͐̾̿̿̒̽͌̚m̵̺̱̰̯͂͗̀̌̂̂͂̒̔̓̃̚ͅỳ̴̡̖̦̱̼̀̆͊͐͗̀̑̓̚ḫ̵̡̧͉͚̪̦̯̥̔̂̅̚͠͠e̴̡̘͕͎͕̪̼̳̼̠̍̾̍̅͑a̴̛͙̰̠̤͗͐́́͆̓ͅd̷͇̩̥̩͇̞͙̠͐̔͑̑̉̾̎̀̄͘̕g̶̡̫̤̬͖͍̣̗̍̇̿̓͂̃̎̌͌̄̈́̋͘̚ͅę̶̡̡̟̤̘̖͔̺͔̓ṫ̵̼̥̪̱͉̅̄o̴̢̜̝͙̙̾̉̐̑̂̅͋̿͆͊͒̀͝u̸̧̞̻̤͎͉̓̌̓́͛̈́̊͌̆̂̀͜͝t̸̨̢̢̞̩͚̲̥̰̗̝̾̽̋̄̈́͜ͅo̴̙̘͍̦̟͔̗̟̤̯͑̔̈́͗͆͝͝͝f̴͔̦̙̥̯͈͓̬̜̠͇̂m̴̧̛͓̙͔̞͖̜̠̙̩̏̀̈͋̃̒͆͆ẏ̷̨̹͉̫̪͚̥̲̹̼̼̦̲̲̞̉̆͋̀̐̈́̌͘h̷̰̉̈̏̓͑͑̐̚e̶͉̬̙̭̒͠a̷̡̧̦̣̖͉̞͉̤̹̝̬̓͑̎͋̈́̔̿͗͂̓̃̋͘͜͠d̷̡͕͙͎͎̥͚͕̼̮̯̫̟̄̎͜͜ģ̶̘̲͓̖̙̖̰͎̩̗̪̽̑̽̏̽̍̾̑é̶͖̜̟̣͖͖̗̥̗̞͆̂̃̈́̏̉͌̓̏͆̌͘͘t̸̡͙͇̲͚͙̻̤̮͕̃̒͆̅̉̌̇̽̀̈́̃̕̕͝ȯ̸̢͙͓͖̤͕̬̘͖̘̯̰̲̩͋̆͒̀̃͑͐ͅu̸̧̢̡͖̱̩̻͙̘̰͕̼̠̪̍̿̎t̷̠̟͍͘õ̵̎͛̋̀͐͋͐͑̓̀̑͜͝͝f̴̢̛̝́̑ͅm̷̜̼̠͚͈̝͉̓̍̈͋͂̚y̶̖̲̝̰̼͕͙͈̝͇͉͊h̴̥̗̰͉̼̜̓̐̍̓̏̊́̓͗̌̓͆̕͜e̴̡̳͍͗̉̈́̃̋̂̀̇͊̆̓͠a̶̩͓̹̐́̀̊͆d̶͖̮̗̹́͌̊̐̌̓̇͐͛̀̿͘̕g̷͉̤͎͖̋͌̚ḝ̷̨̭̘̲̹͎͇͈̳͛̑̔̌͋̈́̋̕͜t̷̼̜͈̹͓͕̦͙̼̓̋̂͆͒̌̄̂̔͐͝ͅo̷̜͉̻͎̜̤͔̟̠̗̗͚̟͚̦̎̆͊ư̶̧̰̥͍̪͚̼̒̃̆̋͂̿͘̚͝t̷̪͈͚̩̞̩̪͋̈͂̔̓ͅo̸̢̪͚̬͎̐͝f̷̨̠͉͚͉̩̥̰̉͂̒̈́̏͂͗̂̆̇̋̓͘m̷̡̲͔̬̠̤̣̝̊̾̓̎̀̔͑ͅy̸̡̤̯̻͙̳̺̖͋̚ͅẖ̶̯̎̂̒̽͆̈͗̓͐͊͝ę̴̻͚͉̪̫̘͍̱̻̬̭̥̣̻̈́̎̅̍̏̈͊͊͐̀̽̏̀́̕a̶͍̫̞͇͉̤̞̍̽̆̋̓̈̃͝ď̵̢̡̡̤̘͙̥̣̘͚͍͎͓̬̪̇͆̀͂͂̕̚͠ǵ̵̙̾͌́̂̈́͝e̸̡͈̜̠̲͆̉̑̒ṭ̴̨̨̰̼͈̗͕͉͖͍̱̹͙͒̆ǒ̴̩̳̱̭͈͓̦͂̇̉͂͆̈́͌͛̕͘u̴͉̟͕̜͚̻͒̏̽̓͜ͅͅt̴̡͖̩͈͚͉̺̝͚̬̺̣͈̹̊̊̃͑̆͠ͅờ̵̡͍͔̱͖͉͇͇̤̼̦̳̜̊͐͆̎̐͜͠f̷̨̢̢̨̪͇͚̗̫͙̹͌m̷͎̪̤̞͇̱̺̖͗̈́͌͋͜͝y̴̛͇̌̐͗͒̈́͆̂͐̚͝h̵́̓̏̅́̅̃ͅẹ̴̢̟͆̀̌͑̂̈̋̾̐́a̵̧̗̟̭͕̤̼̯̭͉̙̯̰̮͊ͅd̶͕̽̔̾̈́̾̅͂̒g̶̛͙͛͐͂̔̽̔̀̑̔̊͂̉͐͝ẽ̸͎̭̳̹̦̖̮̮́͗t̵̬̠͎͎̟͔̮̰͓͕̗̦̳̊̍͑̃̎̈̿͘͘͜͝ͅö̸̗̬̠͛̒̓̔̈́̋̿͋͆̀̄͐͠͠u̶̧̢̧͙̖̫͈̼̘̗̲̹̝̇̓̔̋͊̒͒̑̿̚̕͠͠t̴̥̰̭͈̠̝̬͍̬̺͗̊̂͊̅͋̈́̿͘̚͘͜ỏ̴͚̪̟̣̭̙͋̂̚f̴̢̤͈̮̣͔̬̖̪͓̯̪͚̃̈̇̅̄͋͆͌̂͒͋̋̂̉͑͜͜m̸͔̩̝̝̲̼̖͓̓̽͆̊̄͊y̴̧̢̧̳̘̝̫͉͇̤̝͌̈́̈́̌̈́͑̐̓͋̔̓̾̀͝h̷͍͔͙̫̤̦̹̯̲̤̄̈́̾͌̀̏͛͊͂́͆̚͘ͅė̵̹̺͎̝̦̪͚̤͖͈̙̯̠̱ȁ̶̡̨̛̫̼̖̬̙͇͚̺͚̑̄̏͋̎̽̚ͅͅd̴̡̪͍̲̖̲͈͍̻̰͗̈́̎̇̐͗̄͑͘g̶̢̩̥̘͓̲̤͇̳̻̼͚͍̥͇͑̊̐̇͂̄ė̷̡̺̣̩̳̗̼̳͉̀̾́̏̍͂͠t̶̡̥͓̦͕͚̞̗̆̃͐͐̋̒͂̇̎͗o̷̪̮̺̲̬̟̳͐̑̃̽́͊̿͋͛͒͝͠ͅų̶̨̩̠̱̮̥̜̏̍́̋̐́̋̎̓̉͗͑̚͘͠t̸̡̛̛͎̞̤̙̻̩̘̤̫̓́̈́̋̊̒͑̊̚̕o̷̡̱̟̪̱̰̪͗̊̃̑̀̊f̵̠͓͇͕͙̮̘̯̫̤͙͈̾̋͜m̵̝̭͖͎͈̺̗̲̲͂̈͆̚͝y̴̛̌͌͋͛̈́͂̄̈́̕͝ͅh̸͚̞̻̖̮̫̏͗e̴̡̡̼͈͕̬̬̜͍̫̗̎̏̔̔́̾̇́̍̎̈͐́̈́̕á̵͓̙͚̙͙̝̣͕̺̘͊̿̋̀̈́̕̚d̴̢̙̝̲̹̱̤̟̰̺͕̍̅̄͜ͅ  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorry again. I know I could go back and remove those weird sentences, but something inside me keeps telling me to push forward in explaining what happened. The thought of going back makes me feel queasy. I actually tried to push the backspace just now and started gagging as soon as my finger touched the key, I didn’t dare actually press it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next thing I knew, I got the book, and I had it in my room. I don’t know how I even got it. I swear I wasn’t at a bookstore or library, I had just been looking online at cheap books. Somehow though I had it. I don’t know what came over me, I was having some sort of anxiety attack. I locked the door, and I hid in my closet. My phone had a book light app, and I used that to begin reading. I had to read.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;r̷͕̟̜̹̠̹̟̖͎̰̣̼̋̀͒̀͘͜͝ͅe̵̗͌̑̄͐͒̌̒̈́̅̕͜͝͝a̵̡̼̺̣̺̲͔̖̼̝͔͈͋̿͗̋̽̈́ͅd̴̨̢͇̙̖͕̲̭̬̜̙͕̭̭̲͒̾̃͊̿̉́͛͒̑͐̂͝͝͝ ̷̙̝̩̝͕̣̪̫̫̮̤̲̤̔͑̍̒͑̃̽͑͒͜͠r̶̫̘̪̫̼̣͙̃͑̈̾̄͊͜͜͠e̵̺͍͍͖͚͔͙̖̗̻̋̌̌͒͑̕͜a̵̝̟̅̏́͑͊̀ď̵̛̥͙̭̟̭̥̭͙̖̥͕̞͕̜̗̒͆̋̀͗̀̇̕͝ ̴̮͕̜̖̩̟͓̈́͑̍͛̀̉̒̐̓̉̚a̴̦̖̻͈̣̔̉̓̀ͅͅṅ̵͉̱̟͍̈́̋̄͠͝d̵̨̢̖̤̬͓̥̞͝͝ͅͅ ̴̟̯̰̼̥̹̳̯͇͑̃̓̿͊̌̑̈́͐͋̈̉̎̚͝r̶̭̞̹̳͍̩͖̗͉̝̙̻̉̓̍́̍͜ȅ̶̛̗̋͘̚͝a̴̛̛̮̜̼͔͖̥̝͔̱͍͙̹̜̽̽̓̓̈͛̄̃̇̋͊̐̕͜ḑ̴̖͉̯͎̫͕̞͍͔̲̎͘͝ ̵̧̥̞̯̞̭͖̚b̶̛͇̬͕̯̥̦̑̈́̄͜͝ͅe̷̝̖͝ ̷̧̢̡̛͈̪̭͒̉́́́͑͋̈̍o̴̻̻̯̣̞̫̤̟̦͍̿̂̈́̋̀͌͐̚͝n̴̡̨̯̘̤̻̣͖̞̹̄̔̆ͅͅę̵̖̭̭̠̥̜̾̔̓̾́͐̐̓͐̕ ̵̢̛̺̹͓̮̝̳̾̓̄͆͗̓̓̂̈́̏̃̕w̸̭̰̝͚̭͌̿͌͗͜͝ỉ̸̭͚̥̮̘̱̝͎̳̙̙̣̲̍̋̽́̒͗̔͆̊͛̈͜͜͠͝ṯ̷̀̾̀́͂̆̄̌̀̓̃̒͘͠͝h̴̞̫̝̰͑̇́̈̃̐̄̾̑̈͠ ̴́̀̅̈́͌͛́̃́͂͑́͜͝r̴̨̯̟͓͎̰͈̭͔̖͗͗̀̅̂͐̎̍͝͝e̸̝̳͛͛̌̅̿͌͐̓̍̒͊͠͝a̵̧̛̺̖̜̮̯͉͔͍͉̙͕̅ͅͅd̸̯̩̼͓̺̯̮̪̦̰͔͍͗́̇̈̀ͅͅ ̶̢̽̈̂̋̀̐̏̇̂͘b̷̧͉͕̠̝̪́ǫ̷̤̮̘̟̦͓̂͑ơ̸̧̨̗̯̗̥͌͜͜k̵̢͓̦̳͎̱͖̳̻̰͍͌͐ ̸̢̱̹̜̝͉̪̙̖̯̤͕̺̇ͅơ̷͑̀̆͆͋͂͒̌͐̔̀͊̕͜ń̵̘̣͕̑̈́̀̀̽̓̈́̇̾͋́̾͝ͅe̵̡̠͙̬͈̖̦̲̬̰̝̠͎̎̇ ̸̢̛̝̝͍̙̝̹͍̰̒̅̆̇̉̉̔̍̊̃̉̑̔͜w̷̛͙͕̭̜͈̮͐̐̉̎̌͆̽̓͘i̶̯͎͈̊̈́̉̾̐̂t̷̜̘͗̂̕h̸͓̥̣͐̆͆͐́́̇͘͜ ̵̡̢̨̹͕̜̖̬̬͈̠͓̥͓̌̍̽͂̐̄͑͘͘̕ṫ̸̡̙͕̩͔̲͚̣͕̩̳̣̭̉̈́͗͛͋̓̏́̓̓͒̍͜͠h̸̖̦̗̒͒́͒͘e̵̯̰͐̕ ̸̨͙̭̗̖͔̭͖͕͍͈̮͇̋̍̀̿̒w̶̡̨̭͋̿͊̀͝ỡ̷̡͉͍͇̖͖͉̪̬͉r̸̢̩̘̻̼͓̟̘͓̈̇̽̄̕͜d̶̡̡̞̝̲͕̠̤̠̭͇̠̮́͑́͂͒͒̽͛̏͆̕͝͝ ̵̧̨̨̜̯̪̝̟̠͔̗̮̰̽̀̓͒͘͘͠t̶̫̫͒̂̒͆ȟ̴̰̫̐́̀͛͗͌̀͑͘̕ȩ̴̡̢̱̹̩͇̬̮̠̞̜̜̝̈́́ ̸̨̨̬̦͈̹̗̠̮̰̬̣̘̰͈͐͋͋͋͐̐̍́̾̆̈͘̕͝͝w̶̛͖̹͍̙̙͎̟̳̘̾͊̔̈́̓̽͘̕ͅő̸̩̱̰̎̄͆̓̿̂̒̾̏͐̊͆̓͝ŗ̸̲͎͙̔d̴̡͍͉̀̈̈́̽̍̓̄͜͠ ̵̧͙̥̘̥̠̻̠͉̼͍̜̐̇̉̂̅̓͆̓̃̌͐̉͐͠w̴̛̛̛̙͚̪͇̗̪̜̯̰̹̖͈̼̒̊́̇̅͋̽̆͒͊̚ȉ̸̠̻͓͋̎̎̓̄̎̐̍̃̅̚̚l̶̡̢̗̦̖̘̳͙͙͕̻̹̭̲̖͑͐͒͌̾̈͌̄̐̈̕̕̕͝l̷̝̝̫͉̬̲̜̱͍̫̥̊̈́̂̀̽̊̊́͗̎̃́̕̕ ̸̧̛̹̳͙͖͖̯̗͚͓͔͍̰̪͛͛̊́̓̒́̅̉͗̔͝b̷͖̀̃́͂͠l̵̮̇̾̽̉ẽ̸̡͎̰̝̻͉̫͎͚̞̭͖͆̊͐̃̀͋̈͝ş̷̯͖̗̩̂̄͒̄̂͌̾̔̈́̍͗͆̇͐ş̸̢̛̳͈̻̯̺͍͙̫͎͈̠̥̃͋̔̓́̾̒̽̏̈́̾͛̐͠ͅ ̷̢͖͇̙͊̽̿́̒̓̊̂͝ẏ̸̨̳̲̃́͊͊̀̐̀͛o̵̧̗̺̣̟̣̻͈̎̈́͘͝ͅṵ̷̰̘͉̥̲͓̥̲̗̫̣͈͈̬́̓̈́̍͛́͠͝  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I don’t know why I felt so desperately this need. I was sweating horribly, my hair was soaked and it seemed to be running into my eyes. I’ve never tried drugs before, but I imagine this was what it was like to experience withdrawals?\n\nNow as I said, this is as far as I remember writing. I was super hyped and feeling inspired, I did actually get this black book that prompted me, but it's just a journal. Blank pages, nothing on them.\n\nThe thing is, there's this whole new text in my document that I don't remember writing at all. It is a complete break from the story I was building up to, and was written in a completely different, pseudo-biblical style?\n\n&gt;And I looked, and beheld the giant ████. And I did watch as ████ prepared to go unto battle with the Beast of the Seas. Now behold, I was astonished, for I did see ████ remove his ████, and he did drop his sword and shield. Behold, I watched, as he did strip himself until he was naked, and in his nakedness did he face the Great Beast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked and beheld the Beast was like unto a great serpent, and its head was flat like unto a dish. And I beheld that it had no eyes, but upon the bottom of its head were many mouths, and from these mouths issued forth great waters that the beast did use to drown its foes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now behold I did see the beast rise up, and it did release a great storm from its many mouths to smite ████. And I beheld the beast’s skin, that it was as strong as iron. And behold, upon its skin was all the world, and I did see many great and terrible things upon the skin of the beast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I beheld that ████ did resist the great storm that the Beast smote him with, and I beheld that he did ████ with the Beast. And I beheld that ████ did take the Beast by the neck, and I beheld that he struggled mightily with the Beast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked, and beheld as ████ did drive back the beast, insomuch that the Beast did ████ to its cave. Now behold, ████ did follow after the beast, and I beheld that ████ did espy that beast did have eggs. And behold, there were three eggs, whose ████ were like unto the beast's skin, and there were many great and terrible things that I did see in the ████ of the eggs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked and did witness as ████ the giant did reach forth his great hand, and did smite the eggs. Now behold the beast became still after this, and did seem to die.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked and beheld that ████ did depart out of the den of the beast. And behold I was left alone with the great body of the Beast of the Seas. And as I stood watching, behold! I did feel the woe of the world upon me! For behold, though the beast lay still it was made known unto me that it did still live! Woe, and it did perceive me as I looked upon it!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now behold, to be observed of the beast was surely hell. For though it lay still, it knew of me, and though it lay dead, it was alive and it did comprehend me and consider me in all its ████.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked and behold, the beast did ████ my own image in its skin, and a terrible agony did come upon me. And I felt the torment of hell inside me, the ████ fire of the wicked did fill my throat and ████. And the beast did cause me to shake in its presence, and behold, it did consider me without ████ or mercy. And it came to pass that I did perceive that the Beast did delight in my suffering.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And behold, the Beast did finally stir, and it opened its many mouths, and spake unto me, saying “I Am The One That Always ████. I Am The Lover and She Who ████. Thou wilt return to thy home, and write the things thou hast seen. For in the course of time shall He Who ████ read thy words, and the ████ of the flesh shall begin.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I did look, and upon the skin of the Beast I beheld an image of a creature that surely was great and terrible, an Abomination upon the land and the minds of men. And the Beast did tell me the name of the Abomination, and behold, to hear its name did cause my ears to ████ and the agony of death did come upon me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And behold, the Beast did instruct me that I should instead call it Mbrachorrs, which in the tongue of the Beast meant “The ████ Embrace”. Now behold, I did see great lights along the head of the Abomination. And the lights ████ like the stars of the deep. And I beheld that its mouth was ████, and it did seem to me that the great jaws of the Abomination could consume the earth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I beheld that the arms of the Abomination were as the bodies of many serpents, and they did ████ and ████ at me. And upon the end of each serpent there were many hands, and the hands did reach out to ████ at me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I did look upon the face of the Abomination, and behold it had two great eyes. And in its two great eyes there were thousands more eyes. And the eyes inside the eyes to wax and ████, and did stare at me in lust and desire. And I perceived a great longing from the Abomination, for it did desire me, to consume me. And this desire to cause my frame to shake and tremble mightily.\n\nAnd it just abruptly cuts off right there. Nothing more, no resolution or anything. I have no idea who wrote this, It for sure wasn't me. I don't have the file shared anywhere, so I don't know how this happened.\n\nI'm not sure what's with the black spaces, or what is even going on with this... blurb... at all. The strangest thing though, I keep getting a feeling that the name of the Giant is Saashani? Like, I don't know why I feel that way, but just... that name is what comes to my head.\n\nJust out of curiosity, I checked that journal again, but I didn't see anything special or odd. I figured it was better to play it safe, even if it did seem a little crazy and foolish. I don't know, I think the situation has gotten a little to my head. I am starting to feel a little feverish all of a sudden.\n\nI'll probably rest a bit, and then try to dig in to this a little more. Anyway, I better go now, I'm getting a nosebleed and I don't want that to drip onto the keyboard.",

So here's the first bit that I remember writing.  \n\n\n&gt;I have always loved the Halloween season. I love to look for new books that give me a chill. I’m always searching for any promising titles, ones that sound interesting. I’m a bit ashamed to admit, I do often judge a book by its cover.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I found one a few weeks ago that looked really promising. It was a plain black cover, looked like maybe some sort of textured leather? The title was in a silvery ink, slightly embossed. There was this simple nature to it that really got my attention. I almost felt like I was seeing something more than I was actually seeing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyway, It was called “The Comforting Law”p̴̲̈́͑͊̊̋̇̓̅̑̉͛́́͛͘r̴̡̡̼̠͇̠̣̗̦̎̄͊͛̆́͛͜͝͝á̵̛͍͈̬̞̻̱͗̓́̉̆͒̀́͘̚ǐ̷̧̢̛͉͓̝̦̞̯̣̫͛̄͜͠s̶̥̯̣̬̝̯̟͒̒͂̕͠ȩ̵̧͍̺͔̘͕̭͓̘͈̑̉̈́̇͑͑̿̄̚͜ͅh̴̛̩̄̃̓̏͒̃̈́́̅̍͘͠e̷̹̦̰̞̜̫͙̠̗̖̒̔̾̑͒r̸̻̫̱͍̮̓̾͆̉͝ȇ̴̡̢͚̘͖̪̞̭̼̾͂m̵̡̡͕̥̼̺̼̱̙̺̼̙̭̀̍̃̿̓̒̾̌̄ͅb̵̪͉̲͎̙̥̦͉̹͈̫̥͑́̊͂̂͗͂̔̅̇́͑͌͘͠ͅͅr̸̨̞̝̪̭͕̫͇̱͍͙̎́̃̇̄̚a̶̻̜̭̙̖͉̲̹̩̲̱͈͙͋̽̈͋͊͂́̕ć̷̙̂̈̓̉̒̓̽͋e̴̢̛̖͉̯̝̫͈͙̜̰̙͋̽́̀̋́̎̃͌̈̍̀ͅw̸̡̞̜̲̺͓͇͊͗͆͒͌̒͒̐̅͌̓̈́̂̕ȩ̷̼̩̏̐̋͑̍̉̿͆̂̀͜͠ͅw̷̻̺̣͔̣̰̦̗̳̏́̈́͒̊͒́͒́́̚͝ͅï̵̡̧̛̳̝̫͚̥̪̑̎̚͠l̶̨͙̤̬̮͈̾͐̔̓͝l̴̛̺̫͖̯̻̜͉̣̗͔̦͍̫̙͓̂̓̎̒͊̎̌͊̚͘͠b̶̡̛̜̼̳͔̦̖͖̥̙̜̪̮̏̂̎͒͂̒̆̕͝ȩ̸̨̡̘̰͈͈̳̟̬̭̼̹̹̦̀́́̊̆̽́̽̅̎̊̎̕h̴̩͇̑͆̚ę̴͔̩͎̦̩̮̣͙͚̰̍̈̽͆̾͛̋͂͒̿̄̐̚l̵̨̖̞̠̠͙͍͎̏͋ͅḑ̷̧̻̬̲̼̥͙̣̱͉̟͎̌̏̈̒̄͗̄̓͊̓ͅả̸̝̦̦͇̳͓́̅͆̽̍̿͝n̸̢̢̛̻͎͉̖͖͓̞̟̦̯̝̿̄͒͜ḋ̸̨̡͖̥̻͚̞͉̳̥͎͎̳̠̋̀̐̀́̈́͠l̸̪̹̣̻̟͗̄̒͑̆͋̇̕̚̕̚͝͝ö̴̲̭̣̯̘̱͈͙͔̳̪̬̐́̏͘v̶͇̰̣̖͙̙̩̯̜̫̽͂̂̅̾̋̄̌̈̔̕͘͜ͅͅȩ̴̱̭͙̰̞͓̮̙͔͇̲͔̰̔̍̉̿̊͗͑͑̌͝d̸̢̢̨̨̡̖͚͇͖̞̰̜̩͚͉̐̌̎̀͠͝w̴͚̐͑͌̍ȩ̶̢͔̜̫͓̞͙̞̘̱̈͌̽̑̚̚ȧ̶̛̳̪͔̆̽́̅̓̌͑̆͜͝r̶̛̹̪̥̘͓̳͗͜ȩ̴̳̮̝̜̲̲̞͍͉̌͒ǫ̶͙̘̞̟̊̎̀͘͜͜n̸̗̮̽͝e̷̖̺͙̫̥̼̬̱̻̗̯̖͋̀̽̐̿͒͌͘͠ǫ̵̣̭̺͖̙̗͍̣̫̀̎̿̑̿͆̎͆͛͠ụ̷̧̼͔̟͚̼̣̘̫̼͇̌̑͌́r̷̛̛̻̯̈́̀̓͌̔̾̐̎̅́͝h̷̡̛̳̙̪̜̱̠̤̩͍̪̝̻̮̿͑́̃͆̾̚͝ͅa̵͔͕͛͋̉́́̑̍͛t̷͕̞̔̀ŕ̴̡̳̩̖̤̘̓͊̐̊̈́̇̈͗̈́͌ͅe̵͔͍̰̠̻̙͍̤͆ͅd̶̡̝͖̥͖̦͊̓̄͋̏́́̀̀̋̚b̸̧̦̙̳̞̅͋̄̊́͘̚͝ī̴̢̥̺̆̽̋̌́̋̃́̂̂͘͝ņ̶͎͖͍̝̳̟̗͙̪̼̍̀̌̅́d̷̩̈́s̴̜̖͕̔̍͗̇̾̈́́̐̋̾̈́̌ų̴͎͕̰̰̒s̶̛̫͍̈́̈́́̔͑͒͊̔̒̕͝…  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;… Sorry about that… If you can’t tell yet, I’m not quite alright. That’s why I want to tell this story, I um. I will try to keep myself together for this, but my head is still messed up a bit from everything.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyway, I looked at the book, and there was no synopsis or little blurb on the back. It didn’t look that old, it even had that really nice new blood book smell. The thing was, there was something about the book… I began flipping through the first couple of pages, and… I know it sounds crazy, but it was like reading thousands of stories all at once. As though somehow I had hundreds of books in front of me, and I was reading them all at the same time. But there wasn’t any cacophony of noise, no overwhelming assault on my mind. I don’t know if I can explain it any better… Even though I felt like I could read it just fine, thinking about it or trying to explain it makes my head hurt…  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of course, it wasn’t like that when I first read the little synopsis on the web page. I mean, it still said the same stuff, but… I don’t know how or why, but it just made sense to me at the time. But I wasn’t looking at it on a website, why was there a web page… I was holding the book in my hands, but it was on the screen too? I think something was messing with my head already, as soon as I started looking at that damn book.g̶̢̢̼͍͉͈̯̭͈̪̺̦̭̓̔͒ͅè̸̘͓͚͇́͒̑̆̃̈̔̓͂̕̚t̸̨̼̙͇̲̦̿̆͋̇͌̂̕͜ö̶͈̪͖͈̣͖̻̝̞̥̰̘̲́͌́̆̾̾ͅͅu̷͈̹͕̝̿̊͗t̴̹̍̈́̈́͝ö̷͈̻̼̪́̒̓̄̒͒̽͘͜ͅf̷̺̱̞̬̟̖̭͍̞̗̓̇̌́̑̿͊̌͘̕̚͜m̵̗̣̝̽̽̃́͑͋̐̀̓̓̄̃͆̌̐͜ȳ̵͎̜̰̥̮̠̻̤͔̖̤̈́̀̈́͊͋̿̀̓̚̕̚h̵͉͉̠̳̞͍̿̉̈̉̐̇̓ẽ̷̠͉̱̰̺̺̖͕̪̟̘͈͂̈́̓͝a̸̧̱̘͕̗͉̣͑̃̒̃͛̊̀͛͗̚͠͝d̸̲̠̦̣̲̝̦͕͓̭̠͚̃͋g̶̮̯̈́̎̄̂̋̆͝e̶̡̨̱͕͕̫͈̹̥̘̺̺͌̔̍̌̓̌̏̎́̐͊̔̀ţ̶̨̻̺̻̜̦͇̤̫̣͓̀́͋ơ̶̱͎͎̱̖̥̟̤̪̼̦͇͙̠̌͊͒̔͐́̌̈́̍͊̍̅ủ̴̺̰̝͔̲̰͔̻̝͔̽͗̀̒̀̄̕t̶̡̨̗͍̥̗̪͇̪̻̬̉ơ̷̡̜̭͍͎̼͉͔̰͕͎̼͛̆̽́̓́͛̉̊͌͋͑͜f̵̜̳̯͉͕͙̰͖͖̠̉̒͋̽̂̓͘̕͝͝ͅm̵̤̹̳̀̌̋̓̈̈́͝y̴̡̨̢̛̼̤̙̣̞͉̗̫͉̠̗̆͂̈h̵̡̨̥͎͔̫̜͕̊̍̽̉ë̷̖̼̗̠̻͇͋̚ă̷̧̘̩͉͈̻͍̾͑͂́̃̈̋̃̄̓̽͋͠ḑ̷̧̭͔̲̝̄̋̃̓̈͊̒̀̎̑̃͠͠͝g̵̰̳̳͙̜͇̅̔̋̿̌̊̑̽̎̌̆̕̕ȩ̸̡͈̯͕̳̮͓͉͈͎̓̓͛͗̀ͅt̸̝͐͊̐͐̀̀͂̌͌̚͝͠o̸̡̨̢̹̦͚͍͓̖̗̹͓̔ư̶̰̘̄̌͑́̑̋̿̇̈́̃t̷̰̻͕̰̣̜̗̝͒̒̽̈̐͗͂͒́̂͛̆͘͜͝͝ó̵̡̨̧̯̱̮͓̜̽̈́́̓́̚͘͝͝f̸̛̗̰̭͊͆̆̿̎͐̾̿̿̒̽͌̚m̵̺̱̰̯͂͗̀̌̂̂͂̒̔̓̃̚ͅỳ̴̡̖̦̱̼̀̆͊͐͗̀̑̓̚ḫ̵̡̧͉͚̪̦̯̥̔̂̅̚͠͠e̴̡̘͕͎͕̪̼̳̼̠̍̾̍̅͑a̴̛͙̰̠̤͗͐́́͆̓ͅd̷͇̩̥̩͇̞͙̠͐̔͑̑̉̾̎̀̄͘̕g̶̡̫̤̬͖͍̣̗̍̇̿̓͂̃̎̌͌̄̈́̋͘̚ͅę̶̡̡̟̤̘̖͔̺͔̓ṫ̵̼̥̪̱͉̅̄o̴̢̜̝͙̙̾̉̐̑̂̅͋̿͆͊͒̀͝u̸̧̞̻̤͎͉̓̌̓́͛̈́̊͌̆̂̀͜͝t̸̨̢̢̞̩͚̲̥̰̗̝̾̽̋̄̈́͜ͅo̴̙̘͍̦̟͔̗̟̤̯͑̔̈́͗͆͝͝͝f̴͔̦̙̥̯͈͓̬̜̠͇̂m̴̧̛͓̙͔̞͖̜̠̙̩̏̀̈͋̃̒͆͆ẏ̷̨̹͉̫̪͚̥̲̹̼̼̦̲̲̞̉̆͋̀̐̈́̌͘h̷̰̉̈̏̓͑͑̐̚e̶͉̬̙̭̒͠a̷̡̧̦̣̖͉̞͉̤̹̝̬̓͑̎͋̈́̔̿͗͂̓̃̋͘͜͠d̷̡͕͙͎͎̥͚͕̼̮̯̫̟̄̎͜͜ģ̶̘̲͓̖̙̖̰͎̩̗̪̽̑̽̏̽̍̾̑é̶͖̜̟̣͖͖̗̥̗̞͆̂̃̈́̏̉͌̓̏͆̌͘͘t̸̡͙͇̲͚͙̻̤̮͕̃̒͆̅̉̌̇̽̀̈́̃̕̕͝ȯ̸̢͙͓͖̤͕̬̘͖̘̯̰̲̩͋̆͒̀̃͑͐ͅu̸̧̢̡͖̱̩̻͙̘̰͕̼̠̪̍̿̎t̷̠̟͍͘õ̵̎͛̋̀͐͋͐͑̓̀̑͜͝͝f̴̢̛̝́̑ͅm̷̜̼̠͚͈̝͉̓̍̈͋͂̚y̶̖̲̝̰̼͕͙͈̝͇͉͊h̴̥̗̰͉̼̜̓̐̍̓̏̊́̓͗̌̓͆̕͜e̴̡̳͍͗̉̈́̃̋̂̀̇͊̆̓͠a̶̩͓̹̐́̀̊͆d̶͖̮̗̹́͌̊̐̌̓̇͐͛̀̿͘̕g̷͉̤͎͖̋͌̚ḝ̷̨̭̘̲̹͎͇͈̳͛̑̔̌͋̈́̋̕͜t̷̼̜͈̹͓͕̦͙̼̓̋̂͆͒̌̄̂̔͐͝ͅo̷̜͉̻͎̜̤͔̟̠̗̗͚̟͚̦̎̆͊ư̶̧̰̥͍̪͚̼̒̃̆̋͂̿͘̚͝t̷̪͈͚̩̞̩̪͋̈͂̔̓ͅo̸̢̪͚̬͎̐͝f̷̨̠͉͚͉̩̥̰̉͂̒̈́̏͂͗̂̆̇̋̓͘m̷̡̲͔̬̠̤̣̝̊̾̓̎̀̔͑ͅy̸̡̤̯̻͙̳̺̖͋̚ͅẖ̶̯̎̂̒̽͆̈͗̓͐͊͝ę̴̻͚͉̪̫̘͍̱̻̬̭̥̣̻̈́̎̅̍̏̈͊͊͐̀̽̏̀́̕a̶͍̫̞͇͉̤̞̍̽̆̋̓̈̃͝ď̵̢̡̡̤̘͙̥̣̘͚͍͎͓̬̪̇͆̀͂͂̕̚͠ǵ̵̙̾͌́̂̈́͝e̸̡͈̜̠̲͆̉̑̒ṭ̴̨̨̰̼͈̗͕͉͖͍̱̹͙͒̆ǒ̴̩̳̱̭͈͓̦͂̇̉͂͆̈́͌͛̕͘u̴͉̟͕̜͚̻͒̏̽̓͜ͅͅt̴̡͖̩͈͚͉̺̝͚̬̺̣͈̹̊̊̃͑̆͠ͅờ̵̡͍͔̱͖͉͇͇̤̼̦̳̜̊͐͆̎̐͜͠f̷̨̢̢̨̪͇͚̗̫͙̹͌m̷͎̪̤̞͇̱̺̖͗̈́͌͋͜͝y̴̛͇̌̐͗͒̈́͆̂͐̚͝h̵́̓̏̅́̅̃ͅẹ̴̢̟͆̀̌͑̂̈̋̾̐́a̵̧̗̟̭͕̤̼̯̭͉̙̯̰̮͊ͅd̶͕̽̔̾̈́̾̅͂̒g̶̛͙͛͐͂̔̽̔̀̑̔̊͂̉͐͝ẽ̸͎̭̳̹̦̖̮̮́͗t̵̬̠͎͎̟͔̮̰͓͕̗̦̳̊̍͑̃̎̈̿͘͘͜͝ͅö̸̗̬̠͛̒̓̔̈́̋̿͋͆̀̄͐͠͠u̶̧̢̧͙̖̫͈̼̘̗̲̹̝̇̓̔̋͊̒͒̑̿̚̕͠͠t̴̥̰̭͈̠̝̬͍̬̺͗̊̂͊̅͋̈́̿͘̚͘͜ỏ̴͚̪̟̣̭̙͋̂̚f̴̢̤͈̮̣͔̬̖̪͓̯̪͚̃̈̇̅̄͋͆͌̂͒͋̋̂̉͑͜͜m̸͔̩̝̝̲̼̖͓̓̽͆̊̄͊y̴̧̢̧̳̘̝̫͉͇̤̝͌̈́̈́̌̈́͑̐̓͋̔̓̾̀͝h̷͍͔͙̫̤̦̹̯̲̤̄̈́̾͌̀̏͛͊͂́͆̚͘ͅė̵̹̺͎̝̦̪͚̤͖͈̙̯̠̱ȁ̶̡̨̛̫̼̖̬̙͇͚̺͚̑̄̏͋̎̽̚ͅͅd̴̡̪͍̲̖̲͈͍̻̰͗̈́̎̇̐͗̄͑͘g̶̢̩̥̘͓̲̤͇̳̻̼͚͍̥͇͑̊̐̇͂̄ė̷̡̺̣̩̳̗̼̳͉̀̾́̏̍͂͠t̶̡̥͓̦͕͚̞̗̆̃͐͐̋̒͂̇̎͗o̷̪̮̺̲̬̟̳͐̑̃̽́͊̿͋͛͒͝͠ͅų̶̨̩̠̱̮̥̜̏̍́̋̐́̋̎̓̉͗͑̚͘͠t̸̡̛̛͎̞̤̙̻̩̘̤̫̓́̈́̋̊̒͑̊̚̕o̷̡̱̟̪̱̰̪͗̊̃̑̀̊f̵̠͓͇͕͙̮̘̯̫̤͙͈̾̋͜m̵̝̭͖͎͈̺̗̲̲͂̈͆̚͝y̴̛̌͌͋͛̈́͂̄̈́̕͝ͅh̸͚̞̻̖̮̫̏͗e̴̡̡̼͈͕̬̬̜͍̫̗̎̏̔̔́̾̇́̍̎̈͐́̈́̕á̵͓̙͚̙͙̝̣͕̺̘͊̿̋̀̈́̕̚d̴̢̙̝̲̹̱̤̟̰̺͕̍̅̄͜ͅ  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorry again. I know I could go back and remove those weird sentences, but something inside me keeps telling me to push forward in explaining what happened. The thought of going back makes me feel queasy. I actually tried to push the backspace just now and started gagging as soon as my finger touched the key, I didn’t dare actually press it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next thing I knew, I got the book, and I had it in my room. I don’t know how I even got it. I swear I wasn’t at a bookstore or library, I had just been looking online at cheap books. Somehow though I had it. I don’t know what came over me, I was having some sort of anxiety attack. I locked the door, and I hid in my closet. My phone had a book light app, and I used that to begin reading. I had to read.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;r̷͕̟̜̹̠̹̟̖͎̰̣̼̋̀͒̀͘͜͝ͅe̵̗͌̑̄͐͒̌̒̈́̅̕͜͝͝a̵̡̼̺̣̺̲͔̖̼̝͔͈͋̿͗̋̽̈́ͅd̴̨̢͇̙̖͕̲̭̬̜̙͕̭̭̲͒̾̃͊̿̉́͛͒̑͐̂͝͝͝ ̷̙̝̩̝͕̣̪̫̫̮̤̲̤̔͑̍̒͑̃̽͑͒͜͠r̶̫̘̪̫̼̣͙̃͑̈̾̄͊͜͜͠e̵̺͍͍͖͚͔͙̖̗̻̋̌̌͒͑̕͜a̵̝̟̅̏́͑͊̀ď̵̛̥͙̭̟̭̥̭͙̖̥͕̞͕̜̗̒͆̋̀͗̀̇̕͝ ̴̮͕̜̖̩̟͓̈́͑̍͛̀̉̒̐̓̉̚a̴̦̖̻͈̣̔̉̓̀ͅͅṅ̵͉̱̟͍̈́̋̄͠͝d̵̨̢̖̤̬͓̥̞͝͝ͅͅ ̴̟̯̰̼̥̹̳̯͇͑̃̓̿͊̌̑̈́͐͋̈̉̎̚͝r̶̭̞̹̳͍̩͖̗͉̝̙̻̉̓̍́̍͜ȅ̶̛̗̋͘̚͝a̴̛̛̮̜̼͔͖̥̝͔̱͍͙̹̜̽̽̓̓̈͛̄̃̇̋͊̐̕͜ḑ̴̖͉̯͎̫͕̞͍͔̲̎͘͝ ̵̧̥̞̯̞̭͖̚b̶̛͇̬͕̯̥̦̑̈́̄͜͝ͅe̷̝̖͝ ̷̧̢̡̛͈̪̭͒̉́́́͑͋̈̍o̴̻̻̯̣̞̫̤̟̦͍̿̂̈́̋̀͌͐̚͝n̴̡̨̯̘̤̻̣͖̞̹̄̔̆ͅͅę̵̖̭̭̠̥̜̾̔̓̾́͐̐̓͐̕ ̵̢̛̺̹͓̮̝̳̾̓̄͆͗̓̓̂̈́̏̃̕w̸̭̰̝͚̭͌̿͌͗͜͝ỉ̸̭͚̥̮̘̱̝͎̳̙̙̣̲̍̋̽́̒͗̔͆̊͛̈͜͜͠͝ṯ̷̀̾̀́͂̆̄̌̀̓̃̒͘͠͝h̴̞̫̝̰͑̇́̈̃̐̄̾̑̈͠ ̴́̀̅̈́͌͛́̃́͂͑́͜͝r̴̨̯̟͓͎̰͈̭͔̖͗͗̀̅̂͐̎̍͝͝e̸̝̳͛͛̌̅̿͌͐̓̍̒͊͠͝a̵̧̛̺̖̜̮̯͉͔͍͉̙͕̅ͅͅd̸̯̩̼͓̺̯̮̪̦̰͔͍͗́̇̈̀ͅͅ ̶̢̽̈̂̋̀̐̏̇̂͘b̷̧͉͕̠̝̪́ǫ̷̤̮̘̟̦͓̂͑ơ̸̧̨̗̯̗̥͌͜͜k̵̢͓̦̳͎̱͖̳̻̰͍͌͐ ̸̢̱̹̜̝͉̪̙̖̯̤͕̺̇ͅơ̷͑̀̆͆͋͂͒̌͐̔̀͊̕͜ń̵̘̣͕̑̈́̀̀̽̓̈́̇̾͋́̾͝ͅe̵̡̠͙̬͈̖̦̲̬̰̝̠͎̎̇ ̸̢̛̝̝͍̙̝̹͍̰̒̅̆̇̉̉̔̍̊̃̉̑̔͜w̷̛͙͕̭̜͈̮͐̐̉̎̌͆̽̓͘i̶̯͎͈̊̈́̉̾̐̂t̷̜̘͗̂̕h̸͓̥̣͐̆͆͐́́̇͘͜ ̵̡̢̨̹͕̜̖̬̬͈̠͓̥͓̌̍̽͂̐̄͑͘͘̕ṫ̸̡̙͕̩͔̲͚̣͕̩̳̣̭̉̈́͗͛͋̓̏́̓̓͒̍͜͠h̸̖̦̗̒͒́͒͘e̵̯̰͐̕ ̸̨͙̭̗̖͔̭͖͕͍͈̮͇̋̍̀̿̒w̶̡̨̭͋̿͊̀͝ỡ̷̡͉͍͇̖͖͉̪̬͉r̸̢̩̘̻̼͓̟̘͓̈̇̽̄̕͜d̶̡̡̞̝̲͕̠̤̠̭͇̠̮́͑́͂͒͒̽͛̏͆̕͝͝ ̵̧̨̨̜̯̪̝̟̠͔̗̮̰̽̀̓͒͘͘͠t̶̫̫͒̂̒͆ȟ̴̰̫̐́̀͛͗͌̀͑͘̕ȩ̴̡̢̱̹̩͇̬̮̠̞̜̜̝̈́́ ̸̨̨̬̦͈̹̗̠̮̰̬̣̘̰͈͐͋͋͋͐̐̍́̾̆̈͘̕͝͝w̶̛͖̹͍̙̙͎̟̳̘̾͊̔̈́̓̽͘̕ͅő̸̩̱̰̎̄͆̓̿̂̒̾̏͐̊͆̓͝ŗ̸̲͎͙̔d̴̡͍͉̀̈̈́̽̍̓̄͜͠ ̵̧͙̥̘̥̠̻̠͉̼͍̜̐̇̉̂̅̓͆̓̃̌͐̉͐͠w̴̛̛̛̙͚̪͇̗̪̜̯̰̹̖͈̼̒̊́̇̅͋̽̆͒͊̚ȉ̸̠̻͓͋̎̎̓̄̎̐̍̃̅̚̚l̶̡̢̗̦̖̘̳͙͙͕̻̹̭̲̖͑͐͒͌̾̈͌̄̐̈̕̕̕͝l̷̝̝̫͉̬̲̜̱͍̫̥̊̈́̂̀̽̊̊́͗̎̃́̕̕ ̸̧̛̹̳͙͖͖̯̗͚͓͔͍̰̪͛͛̊́̓̒́̅̉͗̔͝b̷͖̀̃́͂͠l̵̮̇̾̽̉ẽ̸̡͎̰̝̻͉̫͎͚̞̭͖͆̊͐̃̀͋̈͝ş̷̯͖̗̩̂̄͒̄̂͌̾̔̈́̍͗͆̇͐ş̸̢̛̳͈̻̯̺͍͙̫͎͈̠̥̃͋̔̓́̾̒̽̏̈́̾͛̐͠ͅ ̷̢͖͇̙͊̽̿́̒̓̊̂͝ẏ̸̨̳̲̃́͊͊̀̐̀͛o̵̧̗̺̣̟̣̻͈̎̈́͘͝ͅṵ̷̰̘͉̥̲͓̥̲̗̫̣͈͈̬́̓̈́̍͛́͠͝  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I don’t know why I felt so desperately this need. I was sweating horribly, my hair was soaked and it seemed to be running into my eyes. I’ve never tried drugs before, but I imagine this was what it was like to experience withdrawals?\n\nNow as I said, this is as far as I remember writing. I was super hyped and feeling inspired, I did actually get this black book that prompted me, but it's just a journal. Blank pages, nothing on them.\n\nIt was all just rough draft as you can probably tell, there was a lot going on in my head and I was trying really hard to get all my ideas written down before they wandered away from me.\n\nThe thing is, there's this whole new text in my document that I don't remember writing at all. It is a complete break from the story I was building up to, and was written in a completely different, pseudo-biblical style?\n\n \n\n&gt;And I looked, and beheld the giant ████. And I did watch as ████ prepared to go unto battle with the Beast of the Seas. Now behold, I was astonished, for I did see ████ remove his ████, and he did drop his sword and shield. Behold, I watched, as he did strip himself until he was naked, and in his nakedness did he face the Great Beast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked and beheld the Beast was like unto a great serpent, and its head was flat like unto a dish. And I beheld that it had no eyes, but upon the bottom of its head were many mouths, and from these mouths issued forth great waters that the beast did use to drown its foes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now behold I did see the beast rise up, and it did release a great storm from its many mouths to smite ████. And I beheld the beast’s skin, that it was as strong as iron. And behold, upon its skin was all the world, and I did see many great and terrible things upon the skin of the beast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I beheld that ████ did resist the great storm that the Beast smote him with, and I beheld that he did ████ with the Beast. And I beheld that ████ did take the Beast by the neck, and I beheld that he struggled mightily with the Beast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked, and beheld as ████ did drive back the beast, insomuch that the Beast did ████ to its cave. Now behold, ████ did follow after the beast, and I beheld that ████ did espy that beast did have eggs. And behold, there were three eggs, whose ████ were like unto the beast's skin, and there were many great and terrible things that I did see in the ████ of the eggs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked and did witness as ████ the giant did reach forth his great hand, and did smite the eggs. Now behold the beast became still after this, and did seem to die.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked and beheld that ████ did depart out of the den of the beast. And behold I was left alone with the great body of the Beast of the Seas. And as I stood watching, behold! I did feel the woe of the world upon me! For behold, though the beast lay still it was made known unto me that it did still live! Woe, and it did perceive me as I looked upon it!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now behold, to be observed of the beast was surely hell. For though it lay still, it knew of me, and though it lay dead, it was alive and it did comprehend me and consider me in all its ████.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I looked and behold, the beast did ████ my own image in its skin, and a terrible agony did come upon me. And I felt the torment of hell inside me, the ████ fire of the wicked did fill my throat and ████. And the beast did cause me to shake in its presence, and behold, it did consider me without ████ or mercy. And it came to pass that I did perceive that the Beast did delight in my suffering.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And behold, the Beast did finally stir, and it opened its many mouths, and spake unto me, saying “I Am The One That Always ████. I Am The Lover and She Who ████. Thou wilt return to thy home, and write the things thou hast seen. For in the course of time shall He Who ████ read thy words, and the ████ of the flesh shall begin.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I did look, and upon the skin of the Beast I beheld an image of a creature that surely was great and terrible, an Abomination upon the land and the minds of men. And the Beast did tell me the name of the Abomination, and behold, to hear its name did cause my ears to ████ and the agony of death did come upon me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And behold, the Beast did instruct me that I should instead call it Mbrachorrs, which in the tongue of the Beast meant “The ████ Embrace”. Now behold, I did see great lights along the head of the Abomination. And the lights ████ like the stars of the deep. And I beheld that its mouth was ████, and it did seem to me that the great jaws of the Abomination could consume the earth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I beheld that the arms of the Abomination were as the bodies of many serpents, and they did ████ and ████ at me. And upon the end of each serpent there were many hands, and the hands did reach out to ████ at me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I did look upon the face of the Abomination, and behold it had two great eyes. And in its two great eyes there were thousands more eyes. And the eyes inside the eyes to wax and ████, and did stare at me in lust and desire. And I perceived a great longing from the Abomination, for it did desire me, to consume me. And this desire to cause my frame to shake and tremble mightily.\n\nAnd it just abruptly cuts off like that. Nothing more, no resolution or anything.\n\nI'm not sure what's with the black spaces, or what is even going on with this section at all. The strangest thing though, I keep getting a feeling that the name of the Giant is Saashani? Like, I don't know why I feel that way, but just... that name is what comes to my head. I can't shake the feeling that is what should be there?\n\nJust out of curiosity, I checked that journal again, but I didn't see anything special or odd. I figured it was better to play it safe though. I don't know, I think the situation has gotten a little to my head. I am starting to feel a little feverish all of a sudden.\n\nI'll probably rest a bit, and then try to dig in to this a little more. I swear I didn't share the file anywhere, but maybe one of my brothers or friends got access to it and is trying to pull a prank on me. Ah crap, yeah, I will just leave this here and give you guys an update later, I've got a random nosebleed.",

        "text": "In popular folklore, malevolent spirits are incapable of moving objects without the aid of a spirit medium. The thing is, those legends aren’t true. I can attest to the fact they can exert a tangible amount of physical force against things if the desire is strong enough. Angry spirits are the most motivated. Some have claimed to witness poltergeist activity but the degree of influence over the physical world is usually very minor. That’s why even the most compelling video evidence of real-world paranormal activity has been largely underwhelming.\n\nSeeing a baseball roll off a staircase could be caused by a shaky floor or minor earthquake. If captured evidence on film was as compelling as it is in the movies, it would be a very different story. That understandably breeds skepticism in people. I was a skeptic too. That’s putting it mildly. I didn’t believe in the supernatural realm at all. I had no reason to. I’d never experienced anything that could be considered paranormal whatsoever. I was convinced once you’re dead, you are dead and there is nothing else out there. End of story.\n\nRecently my mother gave me a couple of weighted blankets. The idea behind this new fad is that the added weight creates a primal sense of comfort, like you are newborn baby protected from the ills of the world. In practice it was a bit hard getting used to. Feeling heavy bedcovers on a cold night can legitimately be a source of calm and contentment but too much of anything can negate that security effect. Know what I mean? That first night I felt like I had a concrete sidewalk lying on top of me! It was just too much ‘comfort’. I certainly couldn’t imagine anyone who could use more than one of them at a time so I put the other one away in the closet. Since I’d left it sealed in the box, I figured my mom could either return it or give it to someone else.\n\nLittle by little I adjusted somewhat to the one I was using. She’d paid a lot for them and had warned me they required a few nights to adjust to the sensation. I am not one who gives up easily but the transition was difficult. There’s a fine line between secure and smothered I suppose. I might’ve thrown in the towel but I didn’t want to disappoint her. I knew Mom was going to ask me about my experience the next time we talked. She’d raved to everyone she knew how great it felt to be enveloped in them. I didn’t want to lie to her, and honestly, I was a bit envious of how amazing they were in her mind. \n\nIf you’ve heard of sleep paralysis, or ‘the night hag’ you know the troubling condition is fairly commonplace. A lot of people have experienced it. While it does have unique symptoms for each person, there are common elements which affect most sufferers. Some people see demons. Some witness aliens. Some feel an undefined, malevolent presence lurking in the bedroom as they sleep; but they all experience an oppressed feeling of being held down against their will. \n\nFrankly it’s a terrifying condition but easily explained by researchers and neurological scientists. They say the central nervous system shuts off our ability to move while we sleep. That’s to protect ourselves from physically reacting to dreams and getting hurt. The condition occurs because someone partially awakens but their nervous system still hasn’t reengaged their voluntary muscles. \n\nIn this twilight state of pseudo consciousness, they are just ‘awake’ enough to know they can’t move. The person suffering from sleep paralysis begins to freak out and imagines something malignant holding them down. Doctors explain it’s just our unconscious mind’s explanation for why we can’t move. The unique ‘boogeyman’ every person creates within their runaway imagination is what haunts and holds them down against the mattress.\n\nI bet you can see where this is going, can’t you? I’ve experienced ‘the ol’ night hag’ a few times myself, but not for several years. That is, before last night. When it first happens, you’d swear you are fully awake and feel a menacing presence nearby. My prior experiences were definitely spooky but they were nothing compared to this. Not even close. I don’t know if I’ll ever be the same again. I saw ‘it’ out of the corner of my eye, but I couldn’t bring myself to turn my head to face the specter directly. \n\nI wasn’t sure I wanted to see this ungodly thing haunting my bedroom, but I felt certain it was impossible to look directly at it anyway. Perhaps that was self-preservation protecting me from seeing the accursed entity too clearly. When you sense your evil captor has full control of your body, you lie there helplessly. Realizing it has that much power over you only adds to the depths of fear. I shook violently in my resting spot on the bed trying the wrestle free of its powerful telekinetic grip. A hoarse cry tried to escape my paralyzed lips but that too was stifled by the demonic phantom invading my domicile. \n\nIn that moment, you panic. You want to scream. You want to flee or at least defend yourself but the supernatural thing tormenting you has the upper hand. There appears to be no escape. I twitched violently. From within my heaving chest a terrified scream tried to escape but my diaphragm wouldn’t let it free. I couldn’t do anything but writhe and contort within my unresponsive body. It hovered nearby and taunted me, while mentally pressing down on my bound torso from the other side of the room. I could barely even flinch at this unholy invasion. All the while there was a strange, ethereal buzz hissing in my ear.\n\nJust before my heart exploded from the unbearable terror, I forced myself to calm down and try to relax. It went against every defensive reflex a person would attempt in real life. Thankfully I remembered my previous gritty encounters with sleep paralysis. The faintest glimmer of hope washed over me as I tried to remind myself it was possibly just a particularly vivid nightmare. The more I clung to that tiny sliver of logic, the less menacing my supernatural tormenter became. Slowly it faded away until I was able to turn my head in that direction, ever-so-slightly. In the darkened corner it once enveloped, were now only the final lingering shadows of dawn. \n\nFinally I could move again! Immense relief washed over me. My skin tingled and burned with the last vestiges of the harrowing experience. As if my personal testimony wasn’t enough, the drenched bedsheets would’ve attested to anyone how real it felt at the time. Then it occurred to me that the weighted blanket was still pressed against my chest, slowly suffocating me. The damned thing provided the infernal fuel for this nightmare. My imagination inspired my subconscious to explain why the burden on my heaving body was so oppressive. \n\nIt all made perfect sense. That is, until I realized the other weighted blanket was now also lying on top of me! My heart flip-flopped frantically at the realization of what it meant. Over in the corner beyond where my phantom tormenter had loomed, my closet door was flung wide-open. Multiple things were strewn around in disarray! Numerous pieces of Mom’s blanket packaging were all over the floor. It was as if a rabid animal had ripped into it. The cardboard scraps bore the undeniable signs of being burned or incinerated around the edges. \n\nThere’s no doubt in my mind what actually happened last night as I slept. The second blanket was maliciously placed over my body to magnify the specter’s influence. It’s chilling, first hand proof of an evil, supernatural realm. Obviously I could throw away the weighted blankets but what is the point? Could you fall sleep knowing a malevolent force has targeted you for murder? Would you ever feel safe once it has mastered the ability to physically influence objects to this deadly degree? It’s three hours to darkness again. There’s no place to run. What can I do?",

        "text": "With contempt, I closed out of of a entry of a man with a *spooky situation* regarding whispers in his walls. This was of course culminating to the **big scare** of a daunting 7’0 creature with skinny arms, a maw that makes a shark jealous, eyes blacker than overcooked bacon and strength that put world renowned bodybuilders to shame. Of course, leading to the man to warn the danger of hearing the occasional noises in your house before leaving us to dwell on his situation as he presumably gets ripped to atomic gooey residue.\n\nOf course, this didn’t phase me at all.\n\n“I heard scarier stories a a campfire before…” I complained to my friend Antonio, who equally shared the boredom I did.\n\n”Hey man don’t be so harsh! I give it a 6/10.”\n\n”3/10 from me.” He rolled his eyes in response.\n\n”Even if your a snob, I do agree that these stories have been lackluster lately…” In my opinion, they were worse than lackluster; slogging through the same tropes of these oaf narrators running on their 3 braincells and stupidly handling any danger they meet, which turns out to be the same danger or at least a similar one every time has been, grating to say the least. What made it worse is that some of these stories didn’t invoke the feeling of being real at all.\n\nHowever, I’m glad, but also petrified to say that all changed today. Specifically this morning at 3. Me and Antonio, self proclaimed horror connoisseurs and occasional story dubbers were over call goofing around nosleep, screen sharing stories that we came across. We saved the ones we deemed voice over worthy. Some were decent, some were haphazardly written by 1st graders seeing Jeff the Killer for the first time. There was one that later caught Antonio’s eye, named with almost intentionally menacing undertones: ‘I Don’t Expect you to Believe This, and That’s What I Want.‘\n\n“SPOOKY! Am I right Nostalgia Critic?“ Antonio smugly hyped me up as I was taken aback by the title. Is this another ritual story gone wrong? Old curse, I thought to myself? Meh, doesn’t seem too exciting. I hid my anticipation under a facade of underwhelm as he clicked open the story.  The following is word for word of what we read.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n\\[Hello, poor and pathetic user that comes across this post. Let’s cut to the chase. The mods will most likely delete my post, they were covering this shit up for AGES. So I hope to get this out to as many of you as I can. Anywho, I was dealing with, a hinderance so to speak. This hinderance started a while back, when one person first posted about it, then, it became a chain, of the unfortunate people affected trying to save themselves by posting about it, starting the chain again. To my knowledge, All of the other posts about this issue in the past have been taken down in a matter of minutes for unexplained reasons. Guess it’s the mods, or maybe the site itself tryna save the public from this thing. I thought this was all just a rumor, but when I finally came across someone talking about this whole can of worms, I found myself right in their trap. If you really don’t wanna take the gamble on seeing if this whole thing is true, click off now, but you are more than welcome to stay.\n\nWhat I will say might as well not even see the light of day, but I accept the challenge. I been living in fear for far too long. What is this thing you might ask? Well, Ironically I’m not even sure how it looks like, thank god for that. However, I will describe it‘s purpose. I heard it passingly. Usually from the corner of a room, sometimes inches from my ear, but I never get to see it, just a flash out of my peripheral. It said things like, “If you want to survive, you must pass the knowledge of me on.“ Hate to admit it but I have. I first told my coworker in a welding company, which was of course met with a smart remark about me getting back into smoking weed lately. This was done expecting nothing of it, I didn’t think what would follow would be so grim. I promptly saw him in a local news report the next morning where the station labeled him as missing. When I got to the site, the crew was going over ideas of what happened to him, while I just listened in dumbfounded and concerned.\n\nThese claims were all shushed later on in the day, where a follow up report explained his body was found in ”terrible condition“ near the woods by his house. This was later debunked as a **understatement,** as a close friend of his went on to say investigators he visited described him as being a mere skin suit with odd markings near his neck akin to strangulation; nearly nothing left on the inside except his skeletal structure. Needless to say, this revelation left us shook, and I went home with a sense of crushing guilt but also, ~~I hate myself for this,~~ relief. This didn’t end there. I heard the voices again, and this time, I slowly but surely saw more and more of who the voices were coming from; due to the more I ignored it’s commands. It didn’t let me see enough though for me to deduce a description, but the message was still sent. I caved and I shamefully told the most I could—being the coward I am... It was me or them you know?! From me being from a small town in Rural Pennsylvania, the people that soon died under mysterious circumstances didn’t go undetected. Unfortunately no matter what, that greedy bastard always came back for more, and no matter what, I still deterred it from me, which drove me nigh mad. I never had a criminal record, but being connected to the murder of so many people made me think I should just send myself to death row.\n\nThe crew was almost down to 10 less members, my remaining coworkers now murmur behind my back that I been doing all this… It isn’t wrong but still hurts regardless. I even resorted to telling relatives that were on deaths door about this thing, I even started walking up to people at random on the street and tried my damn best to speak their ear off about what this cretin is all about. All of this to avoid the fate of it’s victims. At one point, the news station said 25 people went missing in the last 3 weeks, going off to blame the cause on a possible serial killer. It all wasn’t enough. Whatever this is was coming back more frequently and been hiding itself less. It’s getting bolder, impatient. Just yesterday I saw a hand in the shadows in which I couldn’t make out clutching a doorframe nearly making it splinter. This all brings me to writing this out as you see now. I don’t know if it will work, but I had enough of it all. Enough of being at fault for my friends and families deaths—enough of being under the thumb of such a horrid being. So I hope the internet is the final hurdle I need to go through for it to be satisfied. If not, I guess I’m finding out the truth soon enough. Maybe the reason the chain started in the first place was everyone on here never actually took the many previous OPs admissions of guilt to heart. If you’re still reading this, it appears you stupidly did the same. I don’t have a apology to share; rather a new friend that’s meeting you soon.\\]\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n”5.5/10?” I say, processing the cliched but oddly menacing ’story’.\n\n“What?? That was obviously a 8/10 in my book!” Antonio in pleasant surprise then copied everything into the Google Doc that we use for our voiceovers, instantly deeming it as video worthy.\n\n“I don’t know, maybe it’s cause it’s just chain mail nonsense?”\n\n”Fair, but you can deny it’s written pretty well, that was chilling!” \n\nA side of me kinda agreed with Antonio. Another side wanted to sock the author in the face for his mediocre plot choice. One last side of me, a smaller and quieter side, contemplated if it was real. I shrugged it off. Even if he WANTED us to believe it wasn’t real and tried to go by his truth hard, I was sure it was a rhetorical device for the story to be more compelling. Regardless, these thoughts didn’t let up, especially when…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n”Hmm. That’s weird?” Antonio piped up disrupting my thought. \n\n“What what?” \n\n“I refreshed the page cause my internet was lagging, and now it’s removed?…” I froze. That sounded oddly similar to the circumstances of what the guy described. I felt watched all of a sudden, but stubborn me shrugged all this off. Antonio was fairing worse than me however.\n\n”This isn’t a good sign, the dude DID mention this happened to anyone that mentioned this creature… You think it was removed for unrelated reasons?”\n\nBefore I can speak, I saw something dart in the corner of my eye.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Update): It’s been a few hours from where I left off. And things well, didn’t get any better. After I saw what I saw I fucking booked it to Antonio’s house, he’s only 20 minutes away on blades. I probably looked like a manic roller blading at 3:30 am with my shorts on in freezing night air but I could care less. I barged inside as soon as I got to the door and explained what happened. He was just as scared as me cause apparently in between all this he started hearing voices. Ones that were oddly similar to—ok you know what they were exactly the same as the ones in that story; hearing the same stuff about ”spreading the knowledge“ and what not. My brain was practically melting out my ears making sense of it all. We both didn’t know what our next move was. \n\nUntil, we both decided to see what would happen for ourselves if we told someone. Antonio’s less than adequate step-dad conveniently waltzed onto the scene, the person Antonio wanted to finally move away from for years. We silent came to the conclusion that if all of this truly wasn’t delusion, he really won’t be missed. So, we told him most of everything, leaving out actually experiencing the same things the person from the post had. \n\nHe then unsurprisingly laughed a laugh comparable to a wheezing Gorilla and then spat on Antonio for, “coming up with such a stupid waste of his time”. He then turned on Chainsaw Man and cracked open a Corona, leaving us to walk in bemusement to the kitchen. We waited around, seeing what would end up happening. Soon enough, we heard a scream that sounded almost uncharacteristically high coming from Antonio’s step-dad. We hid In front of the doorway to the living room and, regretfully took a peek.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the vantage point we had, all we saw was the 250 pound boulder of a man being strangled by the neck and being lifted a great distance from the ground by, a appendage of some sort. It was jet black, slimy, coated in what looked like eyeballs (??) and honestly looked like a boa constrictor injected with steroids, except we didn’t know if it was a arm, leg or whatever the fuck. From where we were we couldn’t find out what it was attached to, but it’s better that way. Me and Antonio didn’t stick around for the carnage and bolted to his room, pushing most of the room’s content’s in front of the door.\n\n”DUDE. WHAT IN THE HELL WAS THAT?!” Antonio yelled almost drowning out the chaos going on outside. I was too in shock to even reply, as we then heard a deafening thump. In turn ceasing the cries for help. The house filled with silence for a good 30 seconds until it was broken by-\n\n**”I need MORE.”**  A gravely voice practically shook the house off its foundation. Wettish munching replaced the only sounds in the house besides our own jagged breathing. What needed to be done was clear, we quietly got to work on putting out the word of this monstrosity. A common denominator we soon found out was it seemed people who learned about it’s existence in real life was given no time to spread the word, whilst people learning about it over the internet seemed to have a chance at survival. Sorry to say, but it seems you’ll have to just take that chance. I write this out as Antonio is quickly getting to work on a new video for our channel. On a lighter note he just naturally always had the nicer voice. As for me, I have a little white lie to share.\n\nI pasted in the story from the past OP into this post, after all of this happened… Before it just contained a semi-in depth summary of what the guy said. We can’t risk not passing this onto someone else, so I went the extra mile. But I mean hey, he did warn you, not me. That may have been a cheap way of making you involved but trust me, what we did was expected. This all just goes to show sometimes you really need to heed what a person may say on this subreddit. no matter how fake it may seem. Take this as a warning. Well. Subscribe maybe, and tell someone about what happened maybe. I think it stopped eating...",

        "text": "Christmas has never been my favorite holiday. Yeah, I love free stuff, but it feels like the amount of money I spend always out values the gifts I get. Other than that, I just don’t prefer to hang around a large part of my family, especially for large gatherings. A large part of my family sees our gatherings as a perfect excuse to get black out drunk and talk angrily at each other over politics and all other manner of controversial topics. My family’s Christmas gathering 5 years ago was no different.\n\nI’d flown down to my grandmother's house in southern Florida as the plan was for everyone to meet there and get their fill of food and liquor before finding their way home. I only stayed at my grandma’s house for an hour or so the previous year, so my mom asked that I stay longer this time. According to her, everyone loved seeing me. Although, I’d debate they were too busy arguing what current trend was ruining the world. I ended up staying until about 10 before asking my mom if she could give me a ride back to my hotel since I’d Ubered there originally. She told me that she wanted to stay for a couple more hours, and suggested I try taking the bus to save money instead of ordering another Uber. \n\nHonestly, anything to get me out of that house would have come off as a good idea. I remembered seeing the bus stop on my way to my grandmas, and the walk to it didn’t seem like it would be too far, so off I went. At the time it seemed like a perfectly good idea. I didn’t know the bus schedule or how long they even ran but I was willing to take my chances. While walking back to my dorm in the middle of December would cause me to freeze my ass off. Luckily winter in Florida rarely drops below 70 degrees. It was honestly a relaxing walk, taking in the nighttime air and quiet. I’d started daydreaming about my class schedule next semester before I realized I could make out the bus stop about 30 feet in front of me.\n\nI swore under my breath as I realized someone was sitting there. As much as I hated being around my drunken family, I hated awkward stranger small talk even more. The closer I got, the easier it was to make out the person sitting there. She appeared to be a kindly lady in her mid to late sixties. Her hair was a large ball of silver and dark brown, with a large pair of thick rimmed glasses on her face. I have to admit it took me a good while to make out anything other than the bright pink coat she was wearing. For me, 70 degrees was shorts and T-shirt weather, but I suppose it wasn’t unheard of to see an older person wearing a sweater anywhere that wasn’t 90 degrees. I got within a couple steps of the bus stop bench, before the lady turned to acknowledge me. \n\nShe gave me a very warm ‘Hello and Happy Holidays’ that I returned, along with an awkward smile. I tried not to stare, but what I thought was a pink sweater was actually a thick pink fur and feather coat. I’d honestly never seen anything like it. A majority of the coat was made of pink fur, but the collar sprouted enough feathers to cover five or six birds. Dangling from her neck was a long pearl necklace, with some sort of elongated bird skull in the middle of it. In my head I wondered if she was into exotic fashion, or perhaps a huge bird lover. The sound of her loudly blowing her nose made me jump and shook me from my own thoughts.\n\n“How is your evening, sweetheart?” Her voice was dry but friendly, with an accent I couldn’t quite place. I told her it was fine and returned the question, to which she launched into a wordy recollection of her entire day. I zoned out somewhere around her getting to the middle of her day and kept eye contact while randomly nodding. \n\n“Where is your family now?” Surprised by the sudden change of topic, I responded by jokingly telling her that they were at my grandmother’s house drunkenly singing Christmas carols. She laughed and muttered something about how charming that was. I checked my phone and saw only a couple of minutes had passed and didn’t hear or see any signs that a bus was coming anytime soon.\n\nI remember my eyes starting to feel really heavy. I shook my head, trying to wake myself up, but the feeling stayed.  \n\n“Excuse me? Have you seen my bird?” I looked at the lady again and she had a look of panic and confusion on her face. Honestly, I probably did too. “My bird was in his cage, but now he’s gone.” I looked on the ground and a large old-fashioned birdcage sat between the woman’s legs. How long had it been there? I was pretty sure I hadn’t noticed a big iron bird cage before. It was hard to remember or even think because the tiredness I’d started feeling morphed into a slight feeling of vertigo. It felt like the ground around me had begun to slowly spin.\n\n“Ah, I see him. There’s my darling.” The lady was on her feet now, pointing across the street. Her voice sounded raspier, as if at some point in the last 2 minutes, she had turned into a chain smoker. I followed her finger and saw she was pointing at something standing in the tall grass across the street. I couldn’t make out what the figure was, but I was positive it wasn’t human. It had wide blocky shoulders, and a long, wiry neck, attached to a large circular head. The area of tall grass the figure stood in was covered in shadow, so I couldn’t make out any other details. Through the shadow I could swear the figure was staring directly at us. \n\n“Could you please go grab him sweetheart?” The lady’s voice seemed to be coming from inside my own head, and without even realizing it I felt myself moving toward the figure covered in shadow. As I got closer to the thing it shifted so that its entire body was facing me. It twitched and shook as if electricity was coursing through it. The closer I got, the faster my heart would beat. The more some kind of instinct inside me screamed that I was making a bad decision. But I couldn’t stop myself. It was almost as if I had developed an obsession with reaching whatever this thing was. \n\nI was halfway across the street and a sudden shift in the moonlight illuminated the creature enough that I got a look at something that could only have been born from a nightmare. It spread its arms like it was stretching a pair of wings. Its skin a pale blue and stretched tight over its thin frame. Long stringy pink feathers sprouted from all over its body. Its long snake-like neck waved and slithered through the air, a head that resembled a pink human skull never broke eye contact with me. It’s tiny eyes that glowed a bright purple.\n\nI couldn’t stop myself from walking forward, I couldn’t break my focus away from the glowing purple eyes of whatever thing stood in the grass in front of me. Its neck stretched outward towards me, shortening the distance until we were face to face. \n\nThe loud and long blare of a bus's horn caused me to trip and fall backwards. The horn split me from whatever trance I was in, and I looked around to see the bus stopped and waiting behind me at the bus stop. I hadn’t heard it pull up; I didn’t even know how long it had been there. I twisted myself around and didn’t see the old lady in the pink feather coat. Remembering the creature, I turned and was met by a tall man standing just outside the tall grass. He wore tattered clothing covered by a hood adorned in writings and pink feathers. Several large bird skulls hung from a thick rope necklace and several straps across his chest. I’d slowly started backing away before the man lunged at me, a curved knife in one hand. I scrambled to my feet, and sprinted to the bus, struggling not to trip. \n\nThe driver looked at me with confusion and worry on her face. Asking several questions. ‘Did I take something’ and' ‘Did I know that man’, among the first. I stuttered and rambled spitting out a bunch of random words, eventually she simply waved me to the back. I was the only one on the entire bus. Still no sign of the old lady.\n\nThe bus dropped me a block or so from my hotel and thankfully I made it to my room without any more incidents. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the look of that thing standing in the grass. Something that haunts me as much as that creature, is the fact that 3 people in that area disappeared that night. I always wonder if maybe those 3 people weren't so lucky as to break that creature’s gaze.",

        "text": "I run The Drowsy Spectre, a café meant to serve what new guy calls the ‘odd and supernatural.’ Humans come in sometimes and, as you know, we also employ two of them. Two humans, one forest sprite, and one that has seen the great beyond. And me, of course. I can’t say I appreciate any of these stories, but if you do, then click [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nIf you hadn’t caught on, this is Selene. New guy told you I had his laptop because *someone* doesn’t know the meaning of *secrecy*. Like, was he there for all the vagueness in Richard’s job offer for this place? We picked him because he was quiet! He’s lucky that things have grown monotonous for me lately, otherwise I’d be tempted to take the entire thing down. He *has* broken up routine since starting. Flitting about like a tiny bird, buddying up to everyone (including our most *dangerous* customer).\n\nI saw the update he made about leaving for the woods. I was supposed to write if he didn’t make it back, to tell you all about his last stand. To give one last goodbye. He did make it back, though, but he isn’t in a good way. Seeing as he’s made a few friends on here, he kept trying to find strength to write about what happened. I need him better, though, so it is my turn to write about The Drowsy Spectre.\n\nI’m not allowed to read a specific update, that was part of our deal when he gave me the laptop. I am not a human, not in the traditional sense, so I am bound to my word. That update lines up with our day at the Headsman’s and I am curious if he knows how we all got back here. But, alas, I am honorbound. Obviously the pixie is not available to work her shift, and new guy took the other two with him. I could have called in someone to cover, but Richard is not in on the plan to save the pixie. The shop is closed, remember? Still is. \n\nI’m getting ahead of myself. When the store is closed, we still need it to do what The Drowsy Spectre is meant to. That is still a secret from even the new guy, it seems. When Richard closes the store for a few days, he asks me to turn on the… thing. I’m calling it the thing because you don’t need to know its name. Shouldn’t know its name, rather. \n\nWe took the necklace to the thing. The thing is a white box that glows softly, covered in black markings deeper than midnight. I said some magic words (I’m not new guy, I keep secret things hidden, like they are meant to be). The light dimmed and I opened the box. Inside was a gem that, when held, would cause the necklace and the gem to glow. That’s all you need to know and, honestly, I’ve probably said too much. It did the trick, though. The necklace would have protection much longer than before. However, that came at a cost.\n\nThe shop had *no* protection. None at all. When we turned off the thing, we were effectively open for business. Except it was just me, at night, alone at the shop with no protection. If Tall Ben was able to enter buildings, he could have walked right in. Usually the most dangerous of things (or troublesome) can’t come inside. That was different for one night and they would be coming to torment me. Thanks new guy (and the pixie for getting photographed). \n\nCould I have left? Yeah, sure, but then what would be left of the shop when it opened later? Also, do you know what the box I have is worth? Someone would be coming for it. No, it was upon me to protect what we had. To protect The Drowsy Spectre. \n\nI didn’t have the rules memorized, so it was going to be a tough night. But, as is obvious, I am alive so I guess I did something right. When it comes to orders, I can handle most of what comes through here, but not all at once. This isn’t a little drink cart and the espresso can only pull so fast. Not to mention running back to the kitchen… I don’t think any of you understand the sheer volume of strange things we offer back there. He won’t be put in the kitchen if I can help it, not even at this place. Though it was funny the one night towards the beginning where he accidentally put crushed bone paste on his sandwich instead of mayo. We need someone back there that pays attention.\n\nAnyway, the night it all went down. Everyone gathered at the normal time to open the shop. I brought Pixie with me and kept her in the back (we have a little cot set up for her, all snug in my office). With their new boosted jewelry, the trio went off to save the pixie and get themselves killed. But I couldn’t worry about them (much) I had a shop to run (and survive in).\n\nWith Pixie tucked away and safe in the back I opened the shop on time and started prepping as much as I could. I knew the regulars and their orders so some of those could be made ahead of time. Unfortunately, when some of our more problematic customers caught on to the fact that I was alone, they let the word out. They all knew, they all wanted to see if they could get a piece of me, or a piece of the shop.\n\nTwo hours in was when I made my first mistake. A customer in the drive thru was taking *forever* staring at the menu. (seriously, coffee is coffee, it isn’t that complicated) and I didn’t notice a group of gnomes slip in. Since there was no one inside (and I hadn’t seen the gnomes) I ran into the kitchen to grab the drive thru a muffin and by the time I got back up front they had erected a barricade in front of the door and there was a small group forming and trying to get in. Gnomes have a habit of protecting their favorite places and things. I was thankful, so long as the crowd wanted in. If they lost interest, then I would have to deal with the gnomes. They can be… savage in ways that are more irritating than harmful.\n\nI was trying to go quickly; multitasking, taking orders while steaming milk waiting for shots to finish pulling or beans to grind, but some types have little capacity for patience. A shorter customer I’d never seen before made it to the front of the line, looked like a little old lady, someone’s grandma that knits them a jumper for holidays, and ordered seven shots with a pump of lavender (gross). Seven shots would take a while to pull since I was also making stuff for drive thru.\n\n“I’d like to speak to a manager please.”\n\nShe was talking to me. I was taking too long. Of course, I am the manager. I was the *only* person there! When I looked at her to reply, I noticed she was completely still. Like, not even breathing. Frozen, as if time had stopped for her. Again, the voice came. \n\n“Where is your supervisor?”\n\nThen her eyes tracked me. I didn’t respond since I was not sure what she was, nor what rules regarding her might be broken by opening my mouth. Apparently silence was not the right choice, because her claws came out. Literally.\n\nA large gash in my right arm was the payment for my tardiness. That seemed to satisfy the thing, she left with her hands by her side, her legs unmoving outside my view. She moved through the gnomes as if they were water, then through the door as well. Weird. The wound made me slower, however. I heal pretty quick, but I was too stressed to focus on repairing myself. Someone spilled in the lobby, another threw their drink when they realized that the gnomes were keeping them inside (their barrier had yet to be broken). The lights to the office turned off (I kept the door open) and I had to run to turn them back on. Two customers got into a fight, blaming each other for the gnomes that kept them inside. A third shoved the door open with tremendous strength, throwing the gnomes across the store.\n\nThe newcomer walked up, shoved a hand into each of the two fighter’s chests, and took their hearts togo. Saves me a trip to the kitchen (yeah, we sell hearts) but we lost two customers. That meant there were two dead bodies I couldn’t clean up. Pests were starting to appear from under the tables, under the fridges, under the *tiles*. What a night. I hate it.\n\nBut all these could not harm me, they only made the night so much harder. There were things from the depths of the woods and beyond that could damage me, if they wanted to. That is what the store’s protection is for. The protection that was gone. A customer came in. I was making drinks, food, trying to juggle the front counter and drive thru, and didn’t get a good look at their face. \n\nI began my greeting wrong. “Hello sir, what can I start for you?”\n\nShe was not a sir, I had offended the creature. That is when I looked up. A crooked nose, eyes like emeralds, and hair that seemed to move of its own accord. I believe your world calls it a gorgon. That was not hair, it was snakes. Snakes piled high on her head, coiled around one and other. I needed a camera, so I went to grab my phone. The gorgon reached across the counter and snatched my wrist, not willing to give me an advantage. I would be weak to the power of her snakes’ gaze. I am a strong person, far stronger than any human, but I could not break free of that grip. When I tried, she just came with me. I turned my face away and dragged her behind the counter. She screamed and kicked, her hair hissed and snapped at my wrist. I felt the pain, I knew I was poisoned, but I pulled her towards the window. \n\nThen she cried out in desperation. “Selene, it's okay.” A voice said, one that I hadn’t heard in forever. “Come away, for you have no master now.”\n\nIt was a trick. I knew it was a trick, even in the moment, but I still turned. The gaze of the gorgon had me trapped, frozen like stone. Not even my breath could escape and any human would have been reduced to stone, but I could fight. My body grew hot and the hairs on my arms sizzled as I demanded my faculties back. The gaze was stuck inside my mind, however, and soon I would be a sculpture. The gorgon didn’t let go.\n\nThere was only one way I was getting out of her grip, only one way I was banishing the gaze of the gorgon from my mind. I needed to make a deal. \n\nI threw open the drive thru window. “Amber!” The seal on the back door was broken, she could come inside. “I’ll buy a candle!” My willpower only bought me those seconds, then my bones went rigid once more. It started at the tip of my toes, locking my feet in place, then up my thighs and belly. \n\nThe back door opened and Amber came rushing in. She had a candle in her hand and, to my surprise, looked extremely worried. “What is this?!”\n\n“If I die, the shop is gone!” Even in my panic, I made the threat. “Where will you sell your candles then?”\n\n“Look here.” It tried. I grabbed its right wrist and dug my fingers into its flesh. In doing so, I was turned towards it. My eyes betrayed me and I was once more looking upon the gorgon. My fate was already sealed before, but it was expedited by that stare.\n\nI snapped my fingers, they burned with red flame. “I’ll make a deal with you.”\n\n“You still have it in you, Selene?”\n\n“I do.” It was in my chest, creeping up my lungs. I wouldn’t be able to talk soon. “Remove the gorgon from my mind. Wish them away, and you can sell candles inside.” Oh, Richard would kill me. She didn’t take my hand. “Please, I-” No more words. One last breath, then my lungs were frozen. My shoulders, my neck. I mouthed ‘please’ once more before it took my jaw.\n\nShe stared at me, then at my hand. I was almost done and, once it froze my body, I would become stone. My nose, my eyes, then my whole head. It worked down my elbows, but had not reached my hands yet.\n\nI really thought I was going to die, right there. I never expected to be killed by a customer, not after everything my extremely long life has put me through. I think I was afraid, which I can’t recall feeling before.\n\nThe gnomes ran around without restraint, biting any customer that dared enter the store. Screaming, crying, shouting; that chaos would have been my last experience.\n\nThen I felt a soft hand take mine, extinguishing the fire on my fingers. “Deal.” Amber said, but in a voice not her own. The gorgon vanished in an instant, as did the rigidness of my bones. “You need but ask.”\n\nThat voice, I knew it. I knew it well, most of my life was spent trying to forget it. I looked at Amber, but she was the same. No, not the same. Her eyes were different. Gold, splashed with red. None of you know what that means and you don’t need to, but I did. I knew. I still know and it haunts me.\n\n“See you around, Selene.” Then her own eyes returned. \n\nShe smiled. “Seems you’ve a candle of your own, no need to buy mine.”\n\nI did. In my hand was a fat candle of red and gold wax, glitters of crimson and ocre sprinkled through. It had a flame upon it that wouldn’t go out, no matter how hard anyone tried. I didn’t attempt, I already knew. A deal was struck. Amber would have a candle stand inside and I would live.\n\nPain exploded in my chest. Arms, legs; everything hurt. I fell to my knees and threw up. \n\nAmber watched and sighed. “Can’t have you dying, then our deal wouldn’t mean anything.” She grabbed a shot glass from the counter and scooped up a bit of blood on the floor. “Drink up. Nothing about our deal said to cure the poison.\n\nAn ancient god had stared at me through her eyes. If I died, she’d have to leave. Was that worth it? No, I decided, and drank the thick blood. She nodded, satisfied, and said nothing more. She exited through the back door. My day was not done yet, however, and I stood to see the destruction that my customers were causing.\n\nCame back inside, though. Amber placed a red candle in the center of the room, then lit it with a match. A horrible smell was followed by screams. I felt it too, upon my cheek. A burning sensation that would have any other creature upon their knees in pain. Even I ducked away from the brilliant light that the candle provided. \n\nSizzling. Awful sizzling. Then Amber put the candle out. “Get out, everyone.” I stood and didn’t see anyone obeying. She lit another match, slowly moving it closer to the candle. Even the creatures that could not understand her tongue leapt for the door. The gnomes abandoned any hope of claiming The Drowsy Spectre, and in seconds the store was empty.\n\nAmber turned to me and smiled. “How am I going to get set up with this mess?” She laughed, as if we were close friends, and started cleaning up. “It doesn’t look good for my business.”\n\nThe rest of the night was simple. All business was limited to drive thru and I could handle that easily. If I made a customer mad, I could just close the window. Simple. The sun rose, Amber left with her candles. I closed the store and still hadn’t seen the trio of heroes return. Then, just when I was going to retrieve the pixie, I saw them exit the woods.\n\nOnly, they weren’t all the same. Hook was there. New guy limped along with a stick for support. Kitchen boy wasn’t, though. \n\nHis brother was.\n\nBut it was new guy’s doing, his plan, and his quest to save Em. That is for him to write, but I figured this would keep you entertained until he is well enough. If you want some advice, though, don’t serve gorgons or gnomes at your establishment. They are more trouble than they are worth.",

        "text": "I was 18 in 1966 when I first set foot in Vietnam, arriving at a firebase near Chu Yang Sin. The only way in and out was by helicopter, and it was all day everyday that these aircrews made their deliveries to firebase McKey. On the first night of my tour, a North Vietnamese rocket attack slammed our base, killing a few marines that had arrived before I did. My first patrol was the following day, where we were ambushed, resulting in the deaths of two close friends of mine from basic training. We were under fire pretty much all day and all night, everyday. snipers, mortars, machine gunners, rockets, everything you could think of, they launched at us.\n\nOf course, air strikes hammered our attackers just as much as they hammered us. Napalm, rockets, 1000 lb bombs, and more slammed the NVA around us. You would think that with the constant fighting, bombing, and destruction, the NVA were our main target. At firebase McKey however, that was not the case. Here, entire patrols would be wiped out, seemingly out of nowhere. Whenever there was a lull in the rocket attacks at night, if you listened closely, you could hear the screams of the NVA. Sometimes, you’d hear firefights that seemed one sided. You’d hear AK-47, SKS, and other standard NVA weapons firing, soldiers barking orders in Vietnamese, but no American weapons returning fire, American voices cursing the NVA, or American firepower targeting the firefight. Almost as if they were fighting something, instead of someone.\n\nI got used to it after my first week, but there was an event that made it much worse than I could have imagined. A few ARVN troops arrived, Vietnamese fighting on our side, and one of them bunked with me when my usual bunkmate was wounded by shrapnel. As usual, rockets fell, machine guns fired, and our jets hammered the jungle. Almost like clockwork, after our jets finished up, the one sided firefight started. This time, a little closer than usual. As we listened, the ARVN trooper with me sat up in his bed, and listened with a look of horror upon his face. I thought nothing of it, thinking he was just not used to hearing such events.\n\nThat was until he informed me of what the NVA were saying. All this time I had no idea what was going on, and after he told me, I was wishing I didn’t know. \n\n“They’re saying that they are fighting a Thần Trùng, a demon that tortures the souls of the deceased.” He said.\n\nThere was a sense of fear and seriousness in his voice that made me believe him. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation, but I felt fear wash over me. A thunderous “BOOM!” filled my ears, and the most inhuman, deafening screech I had ever heard rang out. I covered my ears, as did the ARVN trooper, but it only got louder. When it stopped, my ears rang. My vision blurred. Sergeant Clark threw the tent open, and we grabbed our rifles. Our M60 gunners sent tracers out into a specific part of the jungle. As my hearing started to return, I heard our radioman, Bruce, repeating orders barked from Captain Calhoun. \n\nSeeing the Captain's fearful face as he commanded an airstrike to hit the direction of where the screech came from made me feel even worse about the situation. He had been fighting here since 1964, when he was an advisor for local militias fighting the NVA. He had seen death, destruction, and violence on a scale few of us could imagine, he was even at the Ia Drang Valley. He had seen it all, yet, this scared him. An illumination round from a mortar lit up the jungle where the tracers flew. In between a few burnt trees, was what appeared to be a shadow, tearing an NVA regular in half, before sprinting into the jungle as bullets ripped the ground nearby.\n\nEven the NVA didn’t shoot at us, it was almost as if we agreed on a temporary ceasefire to fight this thing. Then, fear filled me as I heard the words, “Sergeant Clark, take the rest of second platoon down there to kill that fucker. Take a flare in case you need us to call an airstrike.” That implied that it was our goal to lure the damn thing in, and call in enough ordnance on top of ourselves to wipe out a small city. \n\n“You’ve got to be fucking kidding,” Clark mumbled under his breath. “Second Platoon, let’s get out there.” \n\n26 of us made our way beyond the wire and sandbags, down the bombed out hill, and into the jungle. Mortars and tracers still landed all around us, but our guys did their best to avoid hitting us. There was really no coordination, no protocol for this kind of event. We just moved in the direction we thought it to be. I held my M16 steadily facing forward. Gene, our M60 gunner who stood at 6’6”, let loose a few rounds in every direction he saw movement, with extra ammo belts over his shoulders. Bruce, the radioman, stayed close behind Clark in case of a needed airstrike. As we made our way further, our group seemed to dwindle. \n\nMen would disappear at the back of the group, or just vanish near the sides. No resistance or gunfire, they just vanished. The Chu Yang Sin mountain had a few caves here and there, and when we reached the entrance of one, we figured that we were at the right place. Our group was 16 strong, 10 men having disappeared. The scratching and inhuman wailing from the cave suggested that we were in the right place. The tracers and mortars stopped hammering the jungle.\n\n“Captain, we’ve reached a cave that we believe to be housing the target.” No response came from the other end of the radio. Through the treetops, we could see firebase McKey, and could hear the sound of approaching jets. We watched as napalm covered the entire hill, leaving few survivors, if any.\n\n“Gene, take a few boys and go check that out, we gotta help our guys.” Clark told our gunner, who responded with, “We can’t split up again, we’re fucked if we do.”\n\nAt that moment, Clark’s head morphed quickly, ballooning up, with a mouth of jagged teeth, which in a fraction of a second, bit down on Gene’s right arm. The rest of what we thought was Clark morphed into this awful creature, tall, with quick, jagged movements that scratched and tore at our troops. Gene drew his knife and fought before being torn apart in front of us. With one quick slice of the monster's arm, Bruce was cut in half, while we shot the thing. It slammed its claws down on my left leg, shattering it. I watched as my comrades fought the beast, and I crawled over Bruce, who was dead. The radio was still working, so I took the phone and called in for base. \n\n“This is Private Kosker, second platoon at firebase McKey. We’re being torn apart by this fucking thing, drop everything you’ve got on the flare.”\n\n“What is going o-?”\n\n“Just fucking do it!! Drop it all!! We’re being overrun!! Captain Calhoun is KIA!!” \n\n“Roger, sending in sorties.”\n\nCommand understood the words “We’re being overrun!” as the sign to glass an entire area. I yelled for Thorne, a lieutenant nearby me, to fire his flare. He fired it into the air. I loaded a new mag into my rifle, and fired in the direction of the beast. It had torn several men apart, and didn’t seem phased by the bullets that hit it. It kept tearing us up, shrugging our bullets off, and then I heard the sound of jets incoming. A salvo of rockets tore up the ground nearby, sending shrapnel into my leg, which was already destroyed. Another dropped napalm, which caught several of our guys in an inferno. The beast turned its attention to me as a few bombs impacted, knocking me unconscious.\n\nI awoke to the sound of rotary engines. All around me, I saw my comrades torn apart, as a few helicopters landed in a clearing made by a bomb. The men got out, and I threw my hand into the air. They ran over to me, I blacked out. When I opened my eyes, I saw a white room, with doctors and nurses, with my right leg amputated, and my left leg not covered by blankets. Before I could speak, a man in a black suit informed me that I would not tell anyone at home about what I had experienced, as it would put them and myself in danger. He informed me that my leg was infected by the scratch. But was being investigated before being removed. They cleared it for amputation, and a month later I was back in Virginia. \n\nOf course, I’m old and nearing the end, this story needs to be shared. I just hope that my story is heard, alongside the rest of the men at firebase McKey. We never should have been there, and the government knew it. Two more entire companies were wiped out before the US abandoned it, claiming the NVA pushed us out. I know the NVA kept fighting that thing for years after I left, and I have no doubt it’s still out there.",

        "text": " \n\nI work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Ewan. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.\n\nWe lived in a house on a farm in rural Tennessee. Me and my strange family, my father Jean Robert, my mother Christie and my little sister Josephine. I was 12. It was 1852.\n\nI knew today was going to be special when I woke up. There was a Huge KKK BBQ and there was going to be all sorts of food for everyone. In our house we have to label the food so it's always nice when there is a big communal feast.\n\nMy father and his buddies were all standing in the kitchen smirking when I got down there that morning. They had white cloaks on and were talking about grown up stuff.\n\nMy father handed me a hog shank drizzled in cheese and said “Eat up boy, you need to get big and strong!”\n\nMy father had never been a fan of my mothers strange rules and was always giving me and Josephine extra behind her back.\n\nMy mother and sister walked into the room. Christie pretended to faint at the sight of the hog head holding an apple in his mouth and Jean Robert caught her, like he always does when she does that.\n\n“The hog flesh is my favorite” Josephine chimed in.\n\nAfter a huge breakfast Jean Robert and his buddies were off to get the next few feasts underway and I did all my morning chores in a hurry.\n\nAfter I had swept the henhouse and fed the horses I headed to the town square where the KKK had hogs, cows, goats and sheep all roasting rotisserie style.\n\nThe weather didn’t seem great though, it almost seemed like it might storm.\n\n“I hope that spiteful fuck upstairs doesn’t rain on our parade” Josephine barked.\n\nMy grandmother Die came up to me looking at me with a discerning, squinty face.\n\n“Do you talk in the mirror everyday like I tell you lad?” She said, like a coiled up snake.\n\n“I usually forget,” I responded before directing my attention elsewhere.\n\nI saw my mother sipping wine, and my father butchering a cow. \n\nI walked up to them and asked “Why does granny always tell me to talk in the mirror?”\n\nChristie spoke up first “You can make friends with those inside you in the mirror!”\n\nJean Robert then chimed in \"The mirror isn't a good place to make friends, Ewan\".\n\nChristie looked at him disapprovingly but said nothing.\n\nI heard Jeff talking loudly to some clansmen “You know I won’t wear a belt until I’ve disciplined one of my children with it!” He laughed gulping beer.\n\nI then heard the old hag Deb screaming at the top of her lungs. “The time has come! Begin the ritual!” \n\nA bunch of klansmen gathered around her and her three sons, who stood there shirtless as it started to rain.\n\n6 klansmen came out of the crowd with saws and they started cutting off their limbs.\n\n“Scott’s strong neck and back, Sean’s strong arms, and Kyle’s strong legs! The perfect son we will create!” she screamed.\n\nThey then started assembling their monster and sewing the pieces on.\n\nI was appalled. I looked around and people were drinking and cheering. I knew there would be a feast but this was too much for me and I began to puke. \n\nI didn’t stand out as lots of people were puking from drinking too much.\n\nAfter they were done sewing the pieces together they put him on a metal plate with a long rod stretching too the sky.\n\nPeople started chanting “Samael, bring our matriarch back so that we may know your way!”\n\nThe rain intensified and people kept chanting that, over and over until a bolt of lightning hit the rod and went through the body.\n\n“It’s alive!” Deb screamed.\n\n“I am alive” the body said in the deepest voice I had ever heard. “It is me, Dora. The dark lord has brought me back.”\n\n“Samael! What has he told you, my precious? What must we do?” Deb cooed.\n\n“No, we now have a new, more powerful dark lord than Samael. The red dragon Sarensetsu is the one who guides us now. He was closer to Yahweh when he fell from grace; and unlike Samael he has a plan to reach godhood still.” She prophesied in an unearthly deep tone.\n\nDeb fell to her knees before Dora. “What must we do? What must we call you?”\n\n“I am Dora, first Grand Wizard of the KKK. And from this point forward grand dragon will be the highest rank below me.” She ordered. “And what we must do. AS you have given me a body we must give our lord Sarensetsu a body. That is the first step he must take to overthrow Yahweh.” She lamented. \n\n“How can we construct a body befitting our new lord?” She cried.\n\n“It is not yet clear to me what we must find. But we must find the most terrifying creature to still walk this earth, and make him a body of them.” She declared. \n\n“We will start with the bears!” Deb screeched.\n\nI then heard a voice loudly in my head.\n\n“I am Yahweh.” it declared.\n\nI then saw a golden dragon floating in place moving around rapidly. No one else seemed to be able to see it.\n\n“Your whole family, along with this whole town is about to try and kill you Ewan. I’m your only friend. There are two ways this can go. You can either listen to me perfectly or be captured. And you're not going to like what they do to you if they catch you.”\n\nBefore I could even respond I was brought back to reality where Dora was talking.\n\n“Deb, one of your sons in a future life will be the reincarnation of Julius Caesar. He is a being called a changeling, and in order to reach the power of level of Yahweh Sarensetsu must eat both him and the reincarnation of Cleopatra. Only then will he be able to overthrow Yahweh. We need to find the Changeling, our god must have food!” She screamed. “We need to do a practice run! A dress rehearsal! We must be ready when that awful man comes back! You!” She screamed pointing right at me. “I don’t like you!”\n\n“Run straight towards her and grab those three journals” Yahweh ordered.\n\nI was terrified but responded without question charging towards Dora. She started barking orders but I wasn’t paying attention anymore. I ran up and grabbed the journals.\n\n“Turn left and run as fast as you can” I heard Yahweh say.\n\nI responded like a trained dog turning and running without a moment's hesitation. \n\nI ducked under two hooded klansmen who tried to grab me and got out of the crowd. I ran towards an open field as I heard disgruntled confusion behind me. \n\n“Don’t let the decoy escape! It’s an ill omen!” Dora cried. \n\nI looked back and saw 2 dozen klansmen staggering towards me. One fell off of his horse, drunk as could be.\n\n“Turn left and keep running” I heard Yahweh beckon.\n\nI didn’t think twice and was off. I could see the klan coming after me but they were so drunk they couldn’t even stay on their horses.\n\n“The ass” I heard Yahweh say.\n\nI looked and saw Alziza, Deb’s old ass tied to a tree, looking straight at me.\n\n“Eeeeaaaaa!” he called.\n\nI quickly untied him and then mounted the ass, running off into the afternoon sun.\n\n“Head straight west, all the way to the Mississippi,” I heard Yahweh say.\n\nI continued west for hours and into the night. Near sunrise the next day I got to the river and saw a quaint little church next to the river.\n\nAn old reverend was there feeding the horses in the pre-dawn light.\n\n“Talk to him. Tell him you need a place to stay and he’ll point you in the right direction.” I heard Yahweh say. “You’ve done very well up to this point, and I’m impressed. A whole new life awaits you.” He said and the dragon disappeared.\n\nI walked up to the preacher and said “The KKK tried to kill me. Do you know of any orphanages I can stay at?”\n\nThe preacher jumped, obviously surprised and looked at me for a good long minute before responding. \n\n“Lad I know the perfect place for you. A steam boat will pass by here at dawn going up the river. There is a monastery there and they would be happy to take in a good, god fearing individual like yourself. I was heading there this morning but the good lord said that there would be a child who needed to go to the monastery more than I! Here take my ticket lest I burn in the lake of fire!” he said handing me a the ticket.\n\nI ate breakfast with the man and he told me stories about these supposed warrior monks. I guess their leader was really old.\n\nAt dawn I went to the boat landing and got on the ship. I enjoyed the scenery as we drove up the river. There were some nice ladies too. Some of them were really pretty.\n\nIn the evening when I got to my stop and got off the boat I could see the monastery in the distance.\n\nI walked up towards it and saw monks all about, practicing martial arts, firing rifle’s and tending to livestock.\n\nAs I approached I saw a monk sitting with a bible and a pen, writing things and crossing things out.\n\n“I need a place to stay.” I stated with intention.\n\nHe turned and looked at me. He looked at me for a long time before responding. “We don’t take orphans, kid. You're a man here, I don’t care how old you are, you will be expected to do a man's work to earn your keep.” He said thoughtfully.\n\n“That's fine, I’m big and strong for my age and I am a hard worker.”I responded tiredly.\n\nHe led me inside the monastery and then to a room with 4 bunks. This spare bunk is yours. Since it's your first night here you have to sweep the room. We do chores in shifts. Tomorrow you will check the schedule at the front of the monastery for your daily allotment of chores. Meals are prepared 3 times a day, once at dawn, once at noon and once at sunset. You don’t show up, you are not fed. You waste any food and you will have a meal cut. You put something on your plate and you eat it.” He turned and looked at me angrily. “They say you spend a day in purgatory for every grain of rice you waste. Want to guess how long you spend wasting a piece of bread?”\n\nI stood there stunned, not knowing what to say.\n\nHe laughed. “Enjoy your first day basically chore free. There won’t be many more non Sundays like it. Also there is a church service every day but the one on Sunday is special. You don’t have to go every day but you will be beaten if you don’t show up on Sunday” He said oozing venom.\n\nHe left after that and I swept the room. I decided to record the events that transpired here in a journal with these other 3. After reading them it makes me so sad to see what Deb did to her children.",

The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Ewan. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.\n\nWe lived in a house on a farm in rural Tennessee. Me and my strange family, my father Jean Robert, my mother Christie and my little sister Josephine. I was 12. It was 1852.\n\nI knew today was going to be special when I woke up. There was a Huge KKK BBQ and there was going to be all sorts of food for everyone. In our house we have to label the food so it's always nice when there is a big communal feast.\n\nMy father and his buddies were all standing in the kitchen smirking when I got down there that morning. They had white cloaks on and were talking about grown up stuff.\n\nMy father handed me a hog shank drizzled in cheese and said “Eat up boy, you need to get big and strong!”\n\nMy father had never been a fan of my mothers strange rules and was always giving me and Josephine extra behind her back.\n\nMy mother and sister walked into the room. Christie pretended to faint at the sight of the hog head holding an apple in his mouth and Jean Robert caught her, like he always does when she does that.\n\n“The hog flesh is my favorite” Josephine chimed in.\n\nAfter a huge breakfast Jean Robert and his buddies were off to get the next few feasts underway and I did all my morning chores in a hurry.\n\nAfter I had swept the henhouse and fed the horses I headed to the town square where the KKK had hogs, cows, goats and sheep all roasting rotisserie style.\n\nThe weather didn’t seem great though, it almost seemed like it might storm.\n\n“I hope that spiteful fuck upstairs doesn’t rain on our parade” Josephine barked.\n\nMy grandmother Die came up to me looking at me with a discerning, squinty face.\n\n“Do you talk in the mirror everyday like I tell you lad?” She said, like a coiled up snake.\n\n“I usually forget,” I responded before directing my attention elsewhere.\n\nI saw my mother sipping wine, and my father butchering a cow. \n\nI walked up to them and asked “Why does granny always tell me to talk in the mirror?”\n\nChristie spoke up first “You can make friends with those inside you in the mirror!”\n\nJean Robert then chimed in \"The mirror isn't a good place to make friends, Ewan\".\n\nChristie looked at him disapprovingly but said nothing.\n\nI heard Jeff talking loudly to some clansmen “You know I won’t wear a belt until I’ve disciplined one of my children with it!” He laughed gulping beer.\n\nI then heard the old hag Deb screaming at the top of her lungs. “The time has come! Begin the ritual!” \n\nA bunch of klansmen gathered around her and her three sons, who stood there shirtless as it started to rain.\n\n6 klansmen came out of the crowd with saws and they started cutting off their limbs.\n\n“Scott’s strong neck and back, Sean’s strong arms, and Kyle’s strong legs! The perfect son we will create!” she screamed.\n\nThey then started assembling their monster and sewing the pieces on.\n\nI was appalled. I looked around and people were drinking and cheering. I knew there would be a feast but this was too much for me and I began to puke. \n\nI didn’t stand out as lots of people were puking from drinking too much.\n\nAfter they were done sewing the pieces together they put him on a metal plate with a long rod stretching too the sky.\n\nPeople started chanting “Samael, bring our matriarch back so that we may know your way!”\n\nThe rain intensified and people kept chanting that, over and over until a bolt of lightning hit the rod and went through the body.\n\n“It’s alive!” Deb screamed.\n\n“I am alive” the body said in the deepest voice I had ever heard. “It is me, Dora. The dark lord has brought me back.”\n\n“Samael! What has he told you, my precious? What must we do?” Deb cooed.\n\n“No, we now have a new, more powerful dark lord than Samael. The red dragon Sarensetsu is the one who guides us now. He was closer to Yahweh when he fell from grace; and unlike Samael he has a plan to reach godhood still.” She prophesied in an unearthly deep tone.\n\nDeb fell to her knees before Dora. “What must we do? What must we call you?”\n\n“I am Dora, first Grand Wizard of the KKK. And from this point forward grand dragon will be the highest rank below me.” She ordered. “And what we must do. AS you have given me a body we must give our lord Sarensetsu a body. That is the first step he must take to overthrow Yahweh.” She lamented. \n\n“How can we construct a body befitting our new lord?” She cried.\n\n“It is not yet clear to me what we must find. But we must find the most terrifying creature to still walk this earth, and make him a body of them.” She declared. \n\n“We will start with the bears!” Deb screeched.\n\nI then heard a voice loudly in my head.\n\n“I am Yahweh.” it declared.\n\nI then saw a golden dragon floating in place moving around rapidly. No one else seemed to be able to see it.\n\n“Your whole family along with this whole town is about to try and kill you Ewan. I’m your only friend. There are two ways this can go. You can either listen to me perfectly or be captured. And you're not going to like what they do to you if they catch you.”\n\nBefore I could even respond I was brought back to reality where Dora was talking.\n\n“Deb, one of your sons in a future life will be the reincarnation of Julius Caesar. He is a being called a changeling, and in order to reach the power of level of Yahweh Sarensetsu must eat both him and the reincarnation of Cleopatra. Only then will he be able to overthrow Yahweh. We need to find the Changeling, our god must have food!” She screamed. “We need to do a practice run! A dress rehearsal! We must be ready when that awful man comes back! You!” She screamed pointing right at me. “I don’t like you!”\n\n“Run straight towards her and grab those three journals” Yahweh ordered.\n\nI was terrified but responded without question charging towards Dora. She started barking orders but I wasn’t paying attention anymore. I ran up and grabbed the journals.\n\n“Turn left and run as fast as you can” I heard Yahweh say.\n\nI responded like a trained dog turning and running without a moment's hesitation. \n\nI ducked under two hooded klansmen who tried to grab me and got out of the crowd. I ran towards an open field as I heard disgruntled confusion behind me. \n\n“Don’t let the decoy escape! It’s an ill omen!” Dora cried. \n\nI looked back and saw 2 dozen klansmen staggering towards me. One fell off of his horse, drunk as could be.\n\n“Turn left and keep running” I heard Yahweh beckon.\n\nI didn’t think twice and was off. I could see the klan coming after me but they were so drunk they couldn’t even stay on their horses.\n\n“The ass” I heard Yahweh say.\n\nI looked and saw Alziza, Deb’s old ass tied to a tree, looking straight at me.\n\n“Eeeeaaaaa!” he called.\n\nI quickly untied him and then mounted the ass, running off into the afternoon sun.\n\n“Head straight west, all the way to the Mississippi,” I heard Yahweh say.\n\nI continued west for hours and into the night.

        "text": "The year was 2002. I was a young man who had become detached from a tour group in the midst of the Australian Outback. After a few hours, I started to succumb to dehydration. I was envisioning a plodding, laboured death in the heart of nowhere, but that didn’t happen. It seemed like a mirage, but \\*the Moon spoke to me\\*. Looking upon me with far-flung craters, which felt like remote eyes, the talking rock said it could save me. I followed a misty, moonlit trail across the arid landscape, and I eventually stumbled onto the town I’d been trying to find.\n\nLater that night, in my hotel bed, the Moon called to me. It offered three wishes. I rushed to the window, confused as to how my replenished body, now fed and watered, could still be hallucinating. And yet, I somehow knew that it was real. I knew the Moon had saved me from the desert. *What do I have to lose by making some wishes to find out?*\n\nSo, I wished for three things:\n\n1. Money\n2. Safety\n3. Health\n\nThe creature had many conditions, but I heeded the warnings from ever story I’d ever been told about both genial and ghoulish genies. The Moon made the parameters of its wish-granting quite clear.\n\n*No wishing for more wishes.*\n\n*No wishing for more wish-granters.*\n\n*No wishing for things to give to other people.*\n\n*No wishing for anything that would contradict the laws of your natural realm.*\n\nThe ideal wishes seemed obvious.\n\n**Money.**\n\nMore money than anyone could ever need. Obviously, I couldn’t shower loved ones with wealth. I kept my job to support my family, but I used the riches to support my own needs.\n\n*There’s always a catch with wishing. Becoming the wealthiest man on earth will make me a target.*When I realised that, I had the idea for my second wish.\n\n**Safety.**\n\nI was not asking for security beyond the laws of nature. I simply wanted assurance that my financial safety net, if it were ever discovered, would be protected.\n\n*But what about security against the passage of time? I can’t wish for immortality… I can employ the world’s greatest doctors, of course, but that’s not enough.*\n\n**Health.**\n\nI specified to the Moon that I was simply talking about safeguards which would abide by the laws of nature. For example, if I had a genetic proclivity towards developing certain diseases, either physical or mental, perhaps the wish-granter could provide a cure. Perhaps the Moon could simply conjure a cure for *every* ailment that could ever face a human being.\n\nThe rock conceded that, even if there were no current cure for certain illnesses, it *could* provide a solution for every health problem that might befall a human being. The Moon couldn’t make me live forever, but it could ensure that I live for an absurdly long time.\n\nI thought I’d covered all of the bases. I truly believed I’d outsmarted some sort of deity. I was a fool. I never should’ve made *any* wishes, but I *certainly* shouldn’t have made the third wish.\n\nTwenty years after my Australian encounter, my wealthy and healthy life took a sour turn. The Moon ensured that there would always be a cure in place for any ailment I would face. It had abolished my mental illness, thanks to a wondrous pill that I wasn’t permitted to share with others. So, this November, I wasn’t phased when my doctor gave a harrowing diagnosis.\n\n“Congestive heart failure,” The woman tentatively said.\n\n*Not to worry*, I thought. *The wish-granter will fix it. It gave me a pill for my mental well-being, and I’m sure it’ll give me a new heart, too. Perhaps it’ll simply grow one for me.*\n\nI waited.\n\nLike a werewolf in a kennel, I howled at the unresponsive moon for attention.\n\nNothing.\n\nAfter weeks without solution, I started to feel consumed by dread. *Has it forgotten about me? The wishes were supposed to apply for the rest of my life.*\n\nThen, one night, the Moon arrived. It didn’t speak from the sky, this time. It spoke from the darkness of my house. A floorboard groaned in the far corner of the living room. Heart thumping rhythmically against my ribcage, I found myself staring into the depths of my lounge’s darkened corner. Something was watching me. The direful creature I hadn’t seen for twenty years. It had no eyes or discernible shape, but it had awful white lips, which glowed like a deformed moon in the night sky.\n\nFear gripped me.\n\n“It’s you,” I croaked.\n\n“I am sorry,” The creature wheezed. “You do not have much time.”\n\n“There’s a waiting list for heart transplants, but I thought you’d have some means of speeding things up,” I replied, trembling at the hidden thing in the corner of my room.\n\n“Yes. I *must* grant your desire. It is my only purpose,” The Moon mouth maliciously whispered. “A wish is a contract. I will find a heart for you.”\n\nBefore the creature evaporated, its white, lifeless lips curled upwards into a malevolent grin. The almost-human expression filled me with a feeling of terror which cannot sufficiently translate to words.\n\nSuddenly, I realised the dread in my heart was more than dread. *Oh, no*, I thought, as I clutched my chest. *It’s happening.* An invisible blade twisted into my heart, and I felt my body seize. Blackness swallowed my surroundings. My vision faded. *Just one more time*, I remember thinking. *Let me see Wendy and Maisie one more time.*\n\nWhen I woke, I was in a hospital room. My chest felt light. It was the healthiest I’d felt in weeks. Wendy was sitting at my bedside, tears flooding her vacant eyes, and a smile was forcefully painted on her pale face.\n\n“You’re awake,” My wife whispered.\n\nI smiled. “Hello, sweetheart. I must’ve given you a scare. I feel much better now, though.”\n\nShe sobbed and squeezed my hand with tremendous strength. There was love in that squeeze, but there was also rage. Inconsolable *rage*.\n\n“They did it, honey. They gave you… They… You…” She moaned like a wounded animal. “You have a new heart.”\n\nThat explained the lightness in my chest, but it didn’t explain the fear on my wife’s face. Her agonised expression haunted me. *Why is she so distraught?* I wondered, shuddering.\n\n“Wendy…” I whispered. “What’s-“\n\n“- Maisie,” My wife interrupted, now bawling. “This evening, she was in an accident. She… She… She didn’t…”\n\nWendy didn’t need to finish any of her sentences. I knew what had happened to my daughter. I knew whose heart was in my chest.\n\nI knew what the Moon had done to grant my wish.",

        "text": "I have two short stories to tell, but I’m going to start off with a little back story. I was the middle child of seven children. I had three sisters and three brothers and we lived with our parents and Nana (who only moved in once her mother passed when I was 3 years old, but she grew up in that house. Her, my parents and three younger siblings still live there currently). I wasn’t the only person who saw/experienced things, and as a child my Nana would tell me endless stories that my parents would roll their eyes at, but I could also see the look in my mother’s eyes when she thought no one was looking. She’s more reluctant to discuss any ‘strange’ things that happened there.\n\nAnyway, the first story is about something we saw many times. The first time I saw it was when I was twelve years old and saw my brother Mikey staring blankly out of one of the windows facing the forest. If my sister Heidi hadn’t pulled us away from the window, I don’t know what would’ve happened. What we saw was an abnormally tall, pale, and thin humanoid-looking creature. To be more descriptive, its skin was an ashy grey sort of colour and its eyes were too far back in their sockets, but still visible. Its bones seemed as if they could rip through its tight, thin skin at any moment, they were so prominent and it’s lips appeared shredded and bloody. I felt a chill go down my spine at the sight of it and noticed Mikey and Heidi did too before she pulled us out of our trance. We didn’t speak of it until Mikey was older and brought it up, and later that very night we saw it again. It was always on the edge of the forest, sometimes hunched over or in a stance that looked like it had been running towards the house but came to a hault when we saw it.\n\nThe second story is from when we had chickens. My mother convinced my father we’d save money on eggs and teach us kids responsibility by having us take care of them, but really she just missed when she was younger and had a pet chicken. We got four of them, named Peachy, Pear, Pumpkin, and Pepper. She doted on them all, but one morning we all were startled by a blood curdling scream from the coop. Every single one of us ran outside to see my mother sobbing on her knees, surrounded by blood and all four chickens running around her. After getting her to calm down, she explained that when she saw the blood, she thought a fox had gotten to her hens, but luckily they were all unscathed. However, there was no explanation for the blood, and small footprints all over the place - like those of a baby. The next 30 mornings, the same thing happened, except after the 3rd morning my mother stopped screaming at it. Sometimes there’d be baby’s footprints, sometimes there’d be adult’s footprints, but mostly there were both. My sister Bonnie and I woke up in the middle of the night and snuck downstairs to get a snack. As we left our bedroom, we saw something out the window surrounding the chicken’s coop; about 15 babies running wild whilst a man held a knife, trying to kill as many as he could. Eventually, one of the babies saw us and let out a strange noise, then ran away followed by all the others. The man looked up at us, said some curse words, then left in the opposite direction. That was the last time my mother woke up to a bloody chicken coop.\n\nI have plenty more stories but I think I’ll leave it there for now.",

        "text": "I was happy at one point in my life casually browsing Reddit and posting to a few subs, one day took my by surprise I had received a message from someone regarding my post and they had a similar experience, so we began talking, Days led into months and so on.\n\nAbout 6 months in I was really digging this girl, Stacy seemed like a really cool down to earth person at first, we had similar interests and everything we talked about seemed to be online with each other's thoughts, it was a great time.\n\nAfter another 6 months Stacy messaged me and asked if I'd be willing to meet her in person I was shocked at first, a girl asking my lonely ass to meet, I thought there's something not right about it but I put it to the back of my mind because I was so desperately lonely I decided to throw caution to the wind.\n\nWe had shared pics and had a few video calls at this point and she was definitely my type of girl, so we decided to meet at a local coffee shop, I won't lie I was incredibly nervous but also excited to finally meet the girl of my dreams.\n\nIt hit about 13:05 when the door to the coffee shop opened and there she stood but there was a big change in her appearance, dressed in all black gothic style clothing, her hair sat gracefully on her shoulders and listened in the light, as she swept a hand through her hair, her face became clearer, a little bit of black eyeliner and lipstick with the same piercings I'd seen before, now this appearance to some is off putting but I honestly thought she was beautiful.\n\nShe walked through the shop turning a few heads to say the least, partly judgemental and partly in awe, because she rocked the look, she sat down and I asked her what she wanted, a hot chocolate with cream and marshmallows with all the trimming, I ordered her drink and we sat and began talking.\n\nWe talked for hours, I mean hours, all the way up until the shop had to usher us out the door, we both left laughing and then she turned to me and said I want you to stay at mine tonight, now usually I'd be a little wary of this situation but all caution being thrown to the wind I decided to say yes.\n\nI couldn't help but think about how lucky I was, random beautiful goth girl taking me of all people back to her place, I was over excited about this situation, after a little walk, we stood outside her place and she stopped me before walking inside.\n\nShe smiled at me and said \"My place is a little odd compared to most places, so please don't be shocked\" I said \"You haven't scared me off yet\" thinking back to certain topics of conversations that should have been a big red flag, I let them flicker through my mind without processing them properly.\n\nShe opened the door and this place was off the chain, she had animal skulls, human skulls and various other occult items all over the place, the walls were painted black and there was a large pentagram on the floor but none of this really bothered me, it should have but it didn't at all, I walked inside and just said \"wow  this place looks amazing\"\n\nShe brushed past my arm and I could see the smile on her face, as she walked towards the sofa and patted it lightly with her hand, which disarmed any bad thoughts I had about her and for further hours we sat and talked, not one of us even looked at our phones, which I thought was great, especially in this day and age.\n\nAfter a little bit she offered me a drink and something to eat, I gratefully accepted the meal and drink without a second thought, I honestly was beginning to fall hard for this amazing girl who only a year ago was a simple message in my DMs.\n\nAfter finishing what was an amazing meal, she sat there just staring at me, \"Do you love me?\" She asked, I pondered the response for a few minutes and it just came out \"Yes\". She smiled and a grin struck her face in a different almost evil way \"Good\" and that's when it happened I became instantly sleepy to the point I realised I'd been drugged with something, I stood up to leave and as I did I fell to the ground hard, crashing into her coffee table and rolling over to see her stood over me, I passed out.\n\nWhen I finally woke, my hands and were bound and I was sat there naked, I could see my clothing piled up,folded neatly to one side and Stacy sat in a chair in front of what I can only say was some sort of vigil, I called out \"Stacy! What the hell is going on!\" Only her head turned and with an almost devilish grin \"You are mine now, you said it yourself, 'You love me and I, I love you\"\n\nI tried to free my hands but she had actually done a good job on making sure that I couldn't. It was at that point she stood up and began singing to me, I couldn't tell you the song but it mesmerized me until about half way through she began ripping her clothes off, as she stood there naked she wretched forwards and backwards still singing until her hands became sort of like eagle claws and her back split open to reveal wings, her teeth grew to fangs and a little blood trickled down from where they split her lip.\n\nShe suddenly stopped and stared at me, she began moving closer but slowly at this point the full panic of what was happening set in, stupidly I wasted my energy trying to get out of the makeshift restraints, I felt her claw snip my hands free, I fell forwards and quickly turned around \"What are you!?\" She smiled and simply said \"I am a siren and you said you love me so now I'm going to make you stay with me forever\"\n\nAs she spoke I managed to get the restraints off my ankles, I started darting around in full flight mode trying to figure a way out of there to no avail, I began to think about giving up each turn I took she was standing right there, waiting for me to embrace her, I didn't know what else to do at this point, I decided to just give up, I walked over to her and she extended her arms out quickly grabbing me and pulling me in, her teeth felt cold as she rested her head against me.\n\n\"Oh it's true, it's true, you do love me\" she whispered, I asked her what would happen now, she said nothing and we just embraced each other for a while as the day grew darker, I asked her if it was ok if I just went to the shop, she said \"I'm not kidnapping you, you can do as you please as long as you return\" she laughed \"I will my love\" I laughed back with a crooked grin.\n\nAs I walked down the stairs I almost broke down, the sight of her after the transformation  in reality was horrific to me, the sounds of her bones crunching and redeveloping and the sound of her skin ripping open, the way her jaw disconnected almost like a snakes but each thing you could hear the bones grinding and clicking together.\n\nAs the fresh air hit me I felt relieved the panic had subsided and the adrenaline had worn off, now I thought what do I do, do I run or should I return. I ran, that day I ran and I haven't stopped, I'm still looking over my should even now, she's still out there but I didn't think going to the police would help, the story was so far fetched I mean she did drug me so what if it was a hallucinogenic or something, the police would never help regardless.\n\nIf I'm still here in a few weeks, I'll post again but hopefully she'll never find me, posting this here may cause her to find me I'm not sure, but I'll post if I can.",

        "text": "Good day to everyone here, call me joseph, i'll be telling you about something that unsettled me, something that rattled me down to my bones, something that i think everyone should know about.  \n\n\nLet's talk about me first, i'm an average or well not quite an average dude 21y with a loving boyfriend 22y, we're both living happy and fulfilling lives, he stays at home and does the housework while i go to my.. work, it's honestly spicier than your average work, hell, i bet even spicier than being a soldier but whatever.   \n\n\nIt was a sunny yet chilly day, i woke up and found him next to me, the love of my life, i don't remember how i got him but i'm happy i did, i got up from bed, took a shower, got dressed and headed out for work.   \n\n\nYou see, my work isn't like your work or anyone else's work, no, it's different. I work as an engineering manager in a facility where entities, anomalies and basically monsters are captured and kept secure, i make sure the engineers do their jobs, fix the test bots and basically do engineer related stuff.   \n\n\nToday, in my office, i found something, it was a weird USB stick, curious, i booted up my computer and plugged the USB stick in, it was downloading something, a video file. Nice, probably a movie someone before me forgot here, i could watch it in my break time.   \n\n\nI worked hard that day looking forward to that movie, i kept thinking about what it could be, everytime the radio announced people to be on break, i hoped it would be us, the engineers, but it wasn't, until it did..\n\n\"Engineering unit, breaktime, 1:30 PM until 2:15 PM.\" \n\nThe radio came to life and announced our breaktime, i squealed like a child getting their first candy bar and quickly headed for my bag to take out my food my dear made for me and put it on the desk, then i headed to the coffee machine to make myself a cup of cappuccino and headed back to my office, i sat down, took a sip of my drink and laid it down on the table so i can look for the file and i found it!   \nI opened it, mug in hand and started watching.  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n**12/29/2009**  \n**Named \"End of the times\"**   \n**Author \"Sam\"**   \n**Playtime 23:47 minutes.**\n\n  \n\n\nHello, sam here. I'm the writer for the P.P.E, you guys probably know me as the writer of the P.P.E. Anyways, straight to the point, i have some good and bad news, which i never thought i'd say, but now i must.   \nLet's get to the good news first, so the maxed foxes have been **exterminated**. They are no more, we've been sending teams upon teams to raid their bases and neutralize every single one of them, even if one is out there, they won't be for long.   \n\n\nOnto..the bad news, to be honest, these are much more than the good news.. Eh, doesn't matter. Right, so let's start off with the fact that many of our commanders, one parent and almost all of the people responsible for guiding soldiers in raids, expeditions and captures have been killed. We can't find anyone and most of our commanders are demoralized, they don't really want to go out there, find an entity only to have no one radio them, tell them when to come back or when to deploy and what to do, add onto that the fact that one parent died and they're one of the few commanders left and you get to understand their demoralization.   \n\n\nNext..we have uh, the fact that we've been experiencing rapid entity breaches and experienced lots of M.F raids, basically this has weakened us and decreased a lot of our personnel and has even \"deleted\" some sites from existence or rendered them useless, such as site-7, which was rapidly raided by the M.Fs and then had E-253 breach, a wendigo and bird hybrid type of thing which is pretty fuckin' hard to deal with since it's a wendigo and it flies, i don't remember how we got it here in the first place but uh i'll guess lots of deaths were involved.  \n\n\nRight, last stuff. We're disbanding, yes, the P.P.E is disbanding, we're going to be no more, why? Well, rapid entity breaches, raids which weakened us and a rapid decrease in site personnel and also lack of funding due to the world governments being in a tough spot right now and our main source of income being the united states. I don't really quite know what happened to us, we were majestic, strong and pretty big at the start but now we're weak and almost devoid of life. We can't really revive this, we used all of our chances.  \n\n\nSo, how will we all disband? Simple.   \n\n\nNuke all the sites, entities inside. Personnel will be evacuated and a team of every site's best fighters will be outside waiting for any entities to emerge to make sure everything is terminated.   \nWe'd ship our entities to someone else but uh..the SCP foundation isn't going to accept anything and our entities are too dangerous to be transported, it wouldn't be fun to deal with something that moves faster than light and more erratically than a kid on sugar rush let alone put it in a truck or ship.   \n\n\nIt was nice being with all of you, i am sam, the official writer and typist for the P.P.E.  \nFarewell, all of you, i'll see you..well, never, i love you all, boys and girls.  \nYou were like my grandchildren, but oh how times change.  \n*-Sam*\n\n**Record over**  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nI sat there in silence, not knowing how to react, i was confused, scared, angry and sad, i was angry at our managers for not telling us anything about us almost disbanding, i was sad for this guy and what he went through, i was scared for some reason and i was confused for good reason.  \n\n\nI was in an emotional wreck, i finished my food in silence and completed my shift, i'd then head to my boss and ask him about the USB.  \n\n\nI entered his office and there he was, sitting in his chair, reading a book, i couldn't see what he was reading, but i didn't care at the time.\n\n\"Boss, there's something i need to talk to you about.\" I asked him nervously, fearing his anger.  \n\n\n\"What do you want?\" He grumbled, as if i were ruining his day and making him more annoyed than he already is.  \n\n\n\"D-Do you know anything about this USB?\" I stuttered while asking him that, sweating and with my shaking hand, handed it over to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Huh..weird, where'd you find it?\" He asked, just as confused as i was and began examining it.  \n\n\n\"My office.\" I answered truthfully, not wanting to waste time.  \n\n\nHe looked me dead in the eye, sweat trickling down his cheeks, then down his shirt, he looked nervous and scared, i had never seen him like this.   \n\n\n\"A-Are you sure..?\" He asked nervously, he was the nervous one this time.  \n\n\n\"Yes, i'm sure, i found it when i was working and thought it was a movie but it turned out to be something else.\" I told him the truth, then i snapped.  \n\"Why didn't you tell me anything about this?! We had a writer and he's probably dead now? We were going to be disbanded? A parent even died and what happened to the nukes!? What hap-\" I was about to finish my rant when he cut me off.  \n\n\n\"Shut up, shut up! You talk too much!\" He hissed at me like a snake, i was going to respond when he beat me to it.   \n\"I haven't told you because i didn't think it was important, didn't want to, didn't need to!\" He snapped back at me, making me feel like i was stupid for accusing him of this \"crime\".  \n\n\n\"I'm sorry, boss, i'm going to go now.\" I apologized and exited the room, ashamed of what i had done, i didn't want any more answers from him, so i had to start looking, first things first were my office and sure enough, i found a secret drawer in the wall after some looking, i opened it up and found just one paper. It was old and it was wrapped in some dry cloth, i removed it and found what seemed to be gold ink or something, the author's intro and outro were written in gold, while the rest in silver ink or what seemed to be it.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nGood day to you my grandchildren, i'm back with some great news. You see, we didn't nuke the site, we almost did, but the parents called that plan a failure and how it wouldn't fix anything, so we ditched it. We decided to start offering bodyguards for famous people, mercenaries in certain wars and started aiding the police in raiding houses and got rid of some of the ISIS members.  \n\n\nDoing that made us recruit more people and also get more funding, which really helped us revive ourselves again and finally come back, we're now much better than the past few months and with the masked foxes defeated, i think we'll be much better than ever!  \n\n\nI wish i could tell you that one parent came back, but they didn't. We're still grieving and mourning their loss and the multiple commanders that died trying to help.   \nI'll be writing more for you, i'll see you next time.  \n*-Sam*  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nAnd that was it..that was honestly the end of it. I left it at that and headed back home, i went to sleep early since i was pretty exhausted today.   \n\n\nThe next day, i went to work. I felt something was off, the air was heavy and hot, it was a bit harder to breathe and my reflexes were slower, i headed to the morgue room, where no one went to except the ones dealing with the corpses. I was looking for the commanders that died, i needed to know more, i just needed to find commanders that died from september to december, but i couldn't find anything, there was too much.  \n\n\nThen, i realized how silly this was, i came back  to my senses, i knew i shouldn't be here, so i went to the door but a gust of wind slammed it shut. I was terrified now, i went for my radio but i couldn't do anything with it, the lights went out. I curled into a ball and shut my eyes tightly, i was terrified, horrified, i was scared of what might hurt me, then i  heard it, faint voices.  \n*\"Riteet..\"*  \n*\"Muv it..\"*  \nThey sounded like nonsense.   \nI felt cold hands on me, i was then yanked and dragged for god knows how long, my chins burnt and were red, then, the dragging stopped.   \nI kept my eyes shut and eventually went to sleep when someone found me. I awoke and i was on the ground, in front of the morgue's door, i was taken to the medical department where my chin was treated, then i was asked what happened , i told them everything and was scolded for going in there, but they sent a team to investigate, no one found anything.  \n\n\nI took the day off, but when i was at home, i received a message from my boss.  \n\"Hey, there's some news. They found this footage in the morgue, take a look.\" My boss sent me a message and a video, the thumbnail was the morgue.  \n\n\nI pressed the video and watched, it was silence at first, then the door opened and i came in. I saw something move, but didn't see what it was, it was too fast, i replayed but still couldn't make out what it was so i just continued, the door slammed shut as expected and then the voices began, but they were clearer this time.   \n\"Retreat..\"  \n\"Move it..\"   \nThey were telling me to move it, to retreat, to get out and get up, but i didn't, i stayed there. Then, something on all fours emerged from the shadows, i couldn't make out the shape but i bet my fucking soul it wasn't human or animal, i was yanked by an invisible force and the creature kept trying to get me but the force kept dragging me more until i was outside, then the creature gave up and disappeared into the shadows.  \n\n\nI was shaking by then, i closed the video and clicked away, my boyfriend asked if anything was wrong and i just shook my head, he seemed concerned and i couldn't blame the guy. I'd then go to sleep a while later.  \n\n\nThat's my story, it's not as spicy or scary as the others, but it's true and it matters to me, not everyone works in a facility that contains demons for a living, not everyone gets to have such a lovely partner and not everyone has such a good life, i do and i have all of it.  \n\n\nThough, there's something that bothers me to this day, i still don't know how the parent died, now that i think about it, i'm actually concerned, what killed them? They have inhuman guards, ones so strong they'd fist fight god and win.  \n\n\nI shouldn't think about it, why should i? I shouldn't, farewell everyone and have a good day.",

        "author": "kuyabooyah",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyglfx/night_shift_story/",
        "text": "Last year in August, I had a creepy night shift experience that has turned me away from ever working alone at night time.\n\nI work for a private ambulance company as an EMT. I was in school at the time, and scheduling offered me a shift that worked with my class schedule but still allowed me to work full time. We have several types of ambulances, including a specialized mobile ICU for transporting sick children (oddly enough that has very little to do with the creepy part of the story). It's a rare kind of shift for EMS because you work alone. The healthcare team is a registered nurse and a respiratory therapist from the nearby children's hospital, and you're basically there just to drive. Every time there's a call, you go pick them up from the hospital and run the call, then drop them and the patient off at the hospital and return to the station alone. I had the night shift for this kind of ambulance, and there was only one rig operating at night.\n\nBecause we need to have two of these rigs available at all times, when one of the special rigs goes down for maintenance, they move all the specialized equipment into a regular street ambulance temporarily. When the specialized rig comes back to the station, someone has to move all that equipment back. At this same time, our bay was under construction so all the rigs were parked outside. There are two parking lots on opposite sides of the building, and the station itself is in a sort of office/warehouse cul-de-sac next to the freeway, so it's pretty far removed from everything and is very isolated at night time. \n\nOn the night of, it was probably my second or third shift. A rig had just returned to the station and no one had switched it all back yet. Dispatch asked if I could do it. I was very new and barely knew where any of the equipment went. In one parking lot, the newly returned rig was parked, and in the opposite parking lot the fully stocked day rig was parked. I figured I would just go back and forth between the rigs and compare set ups so I could put things were they actually go. I would go into the put-together rig, make a list of what was in one cabinet, and go to the other rig and move equipment into that cabinet. I'd also lock the rig I wasn't with incase a supervisor stopped by. \n\nAs I'm returning to the rig to move equipment, I hear something being shuffled around inside of something big and metal. There's a dumpster in a dark corner of the parking lot, so I look over and see the silhouette of something very tall digging around in the trashcan standing on two legs with long arms. My stomach drops and I hold my breath. It's tall enough to just bend over and touch the bottom of the dumpster. Fight or flight finally kicks in and I just slowly back away towards the door never taking my eyes off of it. I badge myself in, close all the blinds, and call dispatch. There's cameras on the sides of the buildings that they have access too, so I ask them to look at the cameras to see if anything is out there. After a few minutes, they tell me they don't see anything. I told them someone else is going to have to finish changing the rig because like hell am I going back outside. They said to call if anything else happens. \n\nDidn't sleep for shit that night, and for the rest of the time I was on that shift, I was very hesitant to step back outside. Luckily, most nights there was a street shift on, I was just unlucky enough that one day that they had called in. May have just been a homeless person and my night brain was playing tricks on me or something, but it was the most unsettling experience for me. Gotta say I was glad when they finished the bay and I could do that kind of thing inside locked doors again.",

        "text": "A silence so shattering it could warp the glass window in front of me. Detached from the rest of the fractured building is a four-square window frame. Behind me is the blown-out office building that used to have the dull monotony of everyday life. That seems like a rich man’s wedding compared to the scene I see before me. A desolate urban wasteland. No vines no overgrowth just a hollow city with the occasional toppled tower. A perfectly tainted image of the failures of old.\n\nThe crackle of buildings and the snapping whip of torn-off cables vibrate through the air. It’s awake. Another tower toppled. \n\nI make sure to time my movement with each of its steps to be sure I’m not heard.  I pass through the dilapidated streets. Coyotes come down from the hills often, their eyes strike my soul. Their paws pitter-patter softly touching the ground. In most cases, I wouldn’t even notice the sounds their paws make but different circumstances.  They don’t attack, knowing we’ll need all the help we can get. I pass by a 2009 Sudan, always love the classics. It has prescription antibiotics in the front seat. I pause. Gears grind through my head at an alarming rate. I decide the risk is too great. Car alarms are a great way to get yourself torn in unusual ways by that thing.  I keep pushing. \n\nFootprints the size of 16-wheelers leave their mark like a black spot warning my eventual fate. The Tantrum of the creature doesn’t end. It’s like city traffic to me always there, always droning on but never fatal if you know what you’re doing. A church continues to hold it’s form on a fractured city block. The rubble surrounding it makes for good decor. The sun sets shining through the mosaic, leaving a sign from God directly in the center of the footprint. \n\nIt’s been out longer than usual. A harsh symphonic screech locates it about 20 city blocks away. I wish that were far enough. I look off into the distance to see it climb up a previously untouched skyscraper. The faint crunch of obliterated glass makes it’s way over to my ears. The building buckling underneath its weight. I look over to the pharmacy, wondering if I really need medicine that I don’t have a use for yet.  The tower releases a guttural moan behind me as the creature removes itself from the top. I don’t dare look back. \n“Damnit” I run into the pharmacy. \n\nA short walk and it’s already here.  “THUD.” The whole building shakes. “THUD.” A six-pack of Redbull hits the floor. “THUD.” Glass hits the pharmacy floor. It’s difficult to run on the waving floor. Sparks fly out of the corpses of the self-checkout machines and the once-grinding fluorescent lights. I run to the frozen aisle. It’s almost a delusional thought but I don’t see many other options to lower my body heat. I push the shelves out of the way as they crash to the same floor half of the pharmacy’s inventory is. Fuck, fuck, fuck. It’s obviously not cold enough. The electricity went out when it came around. “THUD.” I freeze. “THUD.” I hold my breath. “THUD.” I pray. \n\nI haven’t heard anything in the past hour. That means nothing. Its sleep schedule is sporadic. I slowly climb out of the dead refrigerator. The glass shards crunch beneath my military-grade boots. The pharmacy’s inventory is scattered across the floor. Every step is another painful screeching crunch. The medication counter feels like a mile away as I measure in decibels instead of feet. \n\nI pause in the middle of sliding over the countertop. Pills make a violent mosaic on the floor. \n“Fuck” I’m not a fucking pharmacist, I wouldn’t even know where to start.  I make my way off the counter and out through the field of glass shards. \n\nOut in the open again. Empty and alone. Fallen wires lay on the ground like electric serpents. No coyote’s in sight. No friends, No family. I’m losing memories of what it was like to have a person that cares as opposed to a threat in a man’s clothes. It’s a long walk home. \n\n I stand in front of a rusted industrial warehouse. Compared to the rest of the city it’s a pristine new-age castle that a tech titan would frequent more often than his other homes. Boxes upon boxes upon boxes tower to the ceiling. Not a single one touched for years now. The rusted steel door creeks as it opens and I head down to the basement.\n\n“CLANG” Something’s in my home. It sounds like it’s running through the makeshift kitchen. I rush down the steps pistol in hand. \n\n“HEY!” A girl is rooting through my kitchen no more than maybe 15. Age doesn’t matter in a place like this. I’ve seen children kill in a place like this. “HEY!” I shout again. She doesn’t turn around and continues her search for the perfect fucking spice or whatever she’s digging around for. I keep my gun bolted to my hand but I don’t cock it. “Hey what are you doing here.” \n\n“Aba aahh aga” My head whips around. When I see what’s on my bed my gun loosens from my hand just slightly. A baby. \n\n“Hey, kid! What the hell is going on here?” Still, no response as she continues to dig through my food supply. It’s not until I tap on her shoulder with my pistol that she turns around. She turns around lightning-quick. Her eyes widen like the God Damn Grand Canyon. She waves her hand frantically but not a single sound from her mouth. I keep my gun raised. “What’s with the baby?” She doesn’t say anything, her hands slowly drop, I follow with my pistol, still not in its holster thought.\n\nShe pulls up a knife and runs over to the baby. I just hope she’s not the mother. She picks up the child and backs up the basement stairs, knife still in hand. She looks up at the steel door. A prison of the outside world, keeping those inside safe from what’s beyond the barrier. She tightens her grip on the knife. She is caught between a rock and a hard place. The rock doesn’t have teeth twice the size of her. I holster the gun. \n\n“Hey, it’s alright. My pistol’s down.” My front hand is raised. She takes another step back. I take one myself and give her space. “Do you want some food?” I bring out some jerky and a frozen meal… PF changs… Dan Dan Noodles. Probably have the last frozen meals in the area. Thank God for car batteries. I load it into the microwave. No reaction to each prevailing beep of the microwave. “You like noodles?” “Noodles?” Maybe she’s Spanish?  “Tu hablas Englais?” No response. I lean on a wheeless cart I found in a mailroom for the entire three minutes. Just staring at each other, knife still locked in her grip. \n\n“Ding!” The food is done. Looks as bout as good as a microwaved meal is. It’s at her feet. She looks down. As cautious as a TSA agent on 9/12 she puts down her knife. I hand her a fork. She inhales the entire microwave-safe plate. \n\n“Now what’s your name?” She shakes her head and taps her ear twice. She’s deaf. I bring over a piece of paper and a pen. She scribbles out quickly. ‘The baby needs food.’ sprawled on the paper.  A strange name. \nI respond with sincerity. “I don’t have baby food.” She looks at me and taps her ear again. Right, deaf. I flip the other side of the paper. ‘I don’t have baby food’ She scrunches her face and goes off to the bed, baby still in hand. No discussion of if she can even stay. I suppose I can’t just leave her out in the empty. I take the IKEA chair for the night. \n\nThe morning starts with the deaf girl rifling through my kitchen again. Each item makes a completely different noise as it impacts the ground. She wouldn’t hear it anyways. I gather my belongings and prepare for round two on the supply run. Never know what you’ll find out there and not much else to do.  I hear another pair of footsteps trailing her way up the stairs.  I almost groan. I turn around to see her ready-to-go baby in arm. No fucking way.  I tap my lips and stretch my mouth like a fucking yawning cat. “LEEEAAVVVE THE BAAAAABBBYYY HEEEEEEERRREEEE”\nShe brings out the same paper from last night and points to ‘The baby needs food’. The paper rustles as she bats it back and forth. “I AAAAMMM NNNOOOTTTT GOOOIIING WWWWIITTHHH YOUUUU.”\n\nI climb up the stairs, she’s almost at my heels. The baby is thankfully still asleep. The sun filters through the cracks in the ceiling. The warmth against my skin feels nice. I bask in it for a little before I’m interrupted by the deaf girl walking up to me with the baby and the paper. I take a pen and write around the already written words. ‘You can stay here or go on your own.’ She doesn’t take kindly to the response and rattles her paper again. I grab it. ‘I will look for baby formula.’\n\nShe takes it and writes more. We’re writing in the margins now. ‘Hasn’t eaten in 6 days. May not be alive when we get back.’\n‘Who is he?’ I pass the paper back.\n‘I don’t know, found him.’\n\nJesus. I look up at the ceiling. Dust particles romantically float across the ray of light. I’m reminded of my own child her smile, her joy. Young children are so vulnerable. A bird crosses above the hole in the warehouse roof. Fuck. I grab the paper. ‘Do you have a binky?’ Hopefully, keep him busy. She pulls one out of her pocket. God fucking Damnit. \n\nI’ve never been more sensitive to sound in my entire life. The city streets are a Jackson Pollock of junkyard finds and remnants of lives long gone. Despite the hollow-scape it feels louder than the city before it. I am particularly partial towards the familiar cracks of the waking beast. The city birds stopped coming around preferring the habitat of their ancestors to the dangers of the post-urban remnants. A local grocery chain sits on the corner. It’s an oasis in the drudgery. The deaf girl makes a break for it. Her empathy for that child is like a rabid golden retriever running only on immediate instinct with immense disregard for her surroundings. I grab her arm before she can get too far. Shake my head in warning. A finger to my lips. Just because she can’t hear doesn’t mean she doesn’t make noise. \n\nThe store is just as dilapidated as the rest of the environment. The asphalt out front shattered into pieces by an impact no doubt made by the creature. The baby still slung in a blanket across her front binky in mouth. Each aisle looks more and more barren. Forget the canned foods all gone. Something falls to the floor over a few aisles. A shuffling. It drags it across the floor. I hold my hand up to the deaf girl, look back at her, and tap my lips twice. ‘SSSSTAAAYYYYY HHHHHHEEEERRREEEE.’ I mouth.\n\n My heart rate raises with every step. Memories of horrific rumors flood every ventricle in my brain. I couldn’t sleep for weeks after hearing early survivor stories.  Creatures climbing up and down the fire escapes, flesh stretched across drums, night stalkers with eyes said to drive you mad, of course, I’ve been through my own struggles but something about being killed by something so mundane as a small mutated alien freak hits an existential dread of failure that doesn’t strike the same. I can hear it fidgeting around the corner. I detour down the aisle with the utensils, every motion a tepid sidestep. A kitchen knife is quieter than a gun. I come around the edge of the aisle. I take a deep breath and round the corner. I chuckle it’s just that damn coyote. \n\n“CLANG!” A few aisles over. The Coyote makes a dash for it leaving the rotten meat it was dragging on the floor it was most likely found. “aaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH” My stomach drops down miles  Fuck, fuck, fuck. That God Damned Baby. “AAAAAAAHH AHHHHHHHHH” The ground shakes. I sprint so fucking fast it feels like I’m leaving my legs behind. The iron among the skyscrapers stretch. My breathing is heavy. Glass shatters along the side of the building. I feel like I’m suffocating. The low grumble of the horrific beast mimics the shockwaves emanating from the creature. ‘AAAAAHHHHH, AAAAHHHHHH”  I look down every aisle trying to find the source of the sound. It’s hard to hear from the whirlwind of the chaotic symphony.  I feel like screaming for being such a damn idiot but I can’t. It doesn’t even register that the coyote is running back toward me. I find the aisle. She’s digging through boxes and boxes of formula not even noticing the baby. I almost trip over myself, speeding to quiet him. I grab the deaf girl in a panic and take a part of the blanket the kid is wrapped in and shove it in his mouth. Ethics is out the window. She tries to brush me off of her until…\n\nA disgusting slime-ridden slither bounces back and forth around the grocery store followed by the crashing of the aisles around it. The creature’s tongue acts like it has a mind of its own. The muffled tears of the baby have subsided. The deaf girl’s eyes have locked on to the thing behind me. It crawls its way past the aisle. We lock eyes. So much is said between that glance. We move slower than molasses. She is watching her every step. The baby’s mouth is stuffed with a dirty binky and blanket cloth. Pray to God there’s a back door and pray harder we can get to it. The mucus crunches together as the tongue rounds the next aisle over. We’re missing our window. The silent race begins. My heartbeat goes silent almost as if I’m already dead. The deaf girl’s hand grabs mine. My head spins back towards her in panic, I’m sure something went wrong.\n\nI have never seen someone in so much terror. She can’t hear anything happening in the next aisle over. She’s putting her trust in someone she barely knows.  I nod toward her and squeeze her hand right back. With each step, I grow more and more unsure of how to proceed. It’s a risk to stay it’s a risk to move. I chose to step forward, a decision that could kill me, kill us. The slime plastering against the aisle over enforces the sinking terror pounding away in my chest. The end of the aisle. We’ve made it, just not in time. \n\n“Squigggggggggstkstkstk” the tongue rounds the corner. We’re frozen.\n\n“Mmmmppppppphhh” Comes from the baby’s gagged mouth. \n\n“Squig” The tongue freezes. \n\n“Mmmmpppphhh”\n\n“Squuuuuiiiiigggggstkstkstk” It twitches as it turns the corner ahead of us and slides towards the deaf girl. I stop my breathing even that could be too loud. She tightens her grip. I respond with a similar grip hoping that it’s strong enough to get her through this.  We’re surrounded. The baby keeps up his muffled babbling.  The deaf girl has tears of panic drowning her eyes. The tongue lands at the tip of her foot. She almost buckles. I tighten my grip. Stay calm. \n\n\n“Crrraaack SNAP!” She’s screaming. Not a single sound out her mouth but she’s screaming in pain. “Ssssnnniiiittt” It digs deeper. She almost collapses but holds on to the shelf behind her. She knows if she drops the child we will all be dead. She’s holding her tears knowing a single drop could let her living status known to the creature. I tighten my grip, remembering doctors' appointments with my own daughter. She’s on her way out fighting to stay conscious and all I can fucking do is watch. Each snap digs through my ear drums. It’s crippling to be so fucking useless. \n\nA soft gallop sprints past the other end of the aisle. The Coyote is making a break for it.  The tongue releases her leg. Her leg is shattered. A limp bag of skin holding obliterated bone. The tongue retracts at unfathomable speed leaving it’s unfinished prey to wallow. She doesn’t dare move despite the horrific pain she must be in. She holds on to the shelf for her dear life fighting the urge to collapse  The tongue whips a fluorescent light on its way out. She hits the floor just as the tongue crashes into the no longer automatic doors.\n\nNothing to do now but wait. A low grumble and the release of the surrounding building signifies its leave. But we still wait. She finally collapses. I pray that she wasn't too loud. “THUD” The building shakes “THUD” I check for a pulse. “THUD” She’s still alive. “THUD” We wait. \n\nThe rusted walls of my makeshift basement home mock the state we are left in. This warehouse is no place to live.\n\n I stand looking over the baby. The deaf girl lays unconscious. That baby put us in danger. I grip my gun. She won’t let go of that child. He may die soon but we don’t know how long. The deaf girl is unconscious. I unholster my gun. Knife would be too messy. Single bullet and it’s over. The deaf girl is unconscious. Safety is off. We can’t continue like this. She wouldn’t even know it happened. She can’t unattach herself from that child. I’d do the same for my daughter. The deaf girl is unconscious. I have my thumb on the hammer. The deaf girl is unconscious. I pull it back and aim, why do I hesitate? The deaf girl is unconscious.\n\nA rustle from the bed I holster my pistol. Just a flash of corrupt thinking. I keep my eyes locked on that baby. Maybe not so wrong. A forceful tap on my leg, I snap out of it, guard up hand right back on gun. A pen hits the floor. I’m breathing heavy. Heart beating at light speed. The deaf girl motions she needs to write. I pick up the pen and pass her a new piece of paper. She holds up her new sign. ‘I cannot feel my leg… Cut it off’ \n\nProblems run through my head, how to make sure it doesn’t infect, what the fuck am I going to make a prosthetic out of and what do I even cut it with. At the end of it all though I don’t have the resources to fix completely shattered bone. Her leg was already tearing hanging on barely by quickly rotting skin. She was right it needed to be disposed of. \n\nThe first cut into the bruised dying flesh with a kitchen knife is the loudest. The screaming squish of whatever surviving muscle is painful to my ears. I have the highest-proof liquor I could find and some plastic wrap sitting next to me on the bed. The nerves are dead. It’s strange to be sitting in silence cutting a living girl’s leg. The occasional twitch as the dead leg pulls on it’s living appendage. Hours of severing the moldering leg has built up a tolerance to the taste of vomit on my tongue. No bone to cut through. I clean the wound the best I can and plastic wrap the stump. \n\nShe scribbles something down on the paper. ‘I’m going to get antibiotics and food tomorrow.’\n\n“No the fuck you are not.”  I blurt it out. Her being deaf is completely removed from my mind for a brief second but she seems to get the idea. \n\n‘I need antibiotics and the baby needs food’ Is she insane? \n\n“I can go. You aren’t capable like this.” I look directly at her hoping she can read lips. \n\n‘I’m going. I am capable.’ \n\n“With what leg?” With that, it’s the end of the conversation. \n\nI fall asleep in an Ikea chair that night. It’s hard waking up that morning. All the energy was taken from me after yesterday. I brush the morning crust off my eyes. Where’s the deaf girl? Where’s the baby?\n\nEven if I could call out in the towering urban echo chamber she wouldn’t be able to hear me. I start with the grocery store from yesterday. My steps grow heavier and heavier as I approach the atrocity from yesterday. My feet are cinderblocks in tar by the time I get to the door. The floor is covered in dried spit.  Looking around the former grocery store electrifies me into paralysis. Layers of splintered flashbacks crowd my mind. It’s going to burst. I collapse to the ground, oxygen leaking out breath by breath. This is how I end. Not with a bang but with a whimper. The epitome of an existential failure. \n\nA pitter-patter of paws land right next to me. I am greeted by a soft nuzzle. I can’t help but chuckle at the absurdity. It’s the damn coyote. I unravel. Years worth of terror spill out on the grocery store floor. Pent-up guilt of acts unspeakable released from their iron-clad cage. My daughter is front in center in my mind. I can still feel the glass from the car window, still feel the blood rushing to my head the world upside down, still feel the horror of a snapped neck on a seven-year-old girl. I failed her. I can’t fail someone else. \n\nThe coyote is close behind as I wander the streets bouncing from store to store. Nobody for miles. An old newspaper stand is sold out of material. As the sun goes down my worry mounts. Every second has a probability of the creature waking. \n\nThe holy mosaic shines in the center of that same crater. The church still stands tall despite the constant quaking. There’s a 2009 Sudan with the anti-biotics just ahead. Is the risk worth it? Off in the distance is a girl with a makeshift prosthetic and a backpack. She’s smart. I pick up my speed. The coyote follows until…\n\n“CCRRRAAAAAAAAANNNNNGGGGGGGG” The creature lifts itself off the building, its alien features in full sight. The colors of it’s skin change from an urban camouflage to a deep black and orange. It’s spikes flail outward pushing the air around it. It’s tongue unfurls out of its mouth ready for attack. On a regular creature, the steel-like spider hairs on it’s palms and feet would microscopic but this thing matches the size of the 5 story apartment it just lifted itself off of. It climbs over the building crouching as it’s wandering tongue does all the work. It is in a predatory mode. \n\nI freeze. There’s nothing I can do. I will lose again. I can’t lose again. “HEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYY!!!” Its abdominous tongue freezes. \n\n“BARK!” The coyote shifts its stance ready for the creature’s attack. “Grrrrrrrrr” \n\n“HEEYYY!” I pick up a rock and toss it at the car window. The alarm ricochets through the abandoned sprawl. I’m not even sure if the girl has noticed yet. Or if she will even come across the car or what will happen to it but there’s a chance I can save her.\n\n“CRUNCH” It moves its legs shifting its position. A low groan builds within its system. “wwwwwwwrrrrrRRRRRRRRRAAAAAA AA AA AAA AAA AAA KKKKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” Windows shatter, I am pushed to the ground. I look up at the sky. Ears ringing. “THUD” I am good. “THUD” I am whole. “THUD” I am fulfilled.",

However, when he was finished, everything was still there.\n\nWith a start, Michael reached out a trembling hand and attempted to touch the mirror however, his hand passed directly through the silvery surface.\n\nFour a  minute Michael debated with himself whether he should go through the glowing portal or not, and with a shrug of his shoulders he walked through and everything faded to black.\n\n\nChapter 2 : the awakening Michael woke to the prick of a needle in his neck and a robotic voice.\n\nHe is awake said a gentle robotic voice on his left side.\n\nHe then heard a human voice which sounded to him maybe like a   female. “wow carnella our procedure seems to have worked we have successfully brought back a healthy human from the middle of the  21st century”\nMichael had enough of everyone talking around him and he still couldn’t see anything it was still pitch black.\n\n\nWith a stretch Michael spoke what in  the world  is going on here?\n Where the hell am I at?\n\n He then heard the android\n\nOn his left say  “My name is magnolia, we have managed to shift you from your base reality to this parallel reality, which is  further along in the timestream”.\n\n \nThere is a major conflict that troubles our hajiminy star  system and that is \nwhy we  have shifted you forward in the  timestream because we need your assistance, said carnella.\n \nWe have brought you forward to the year 2345\nPlease do not stress yourself.\n\n in a few minutes your mind should adjust to the implant that will help you survive better in our time.\n\nMichael was so confused, and he wanted to get to the bottom of this.\n\nWhat implant are you talking about.\n\n   \n(Carnella said)We have outfitted your body with our state of the art cybernetic implants which will allow  your mind to Connect and interphase with all devices and networks in our timeline, and which will allow you to do way more things than you are remotely used to in your time.\n\nI am very sorry, but you might feel a brief bit of pain while we activate the systems, but trust me it is so worth it.\n\n\nchapter 3: the implants  Michael then felt a blinding pain in his head as the girl carnella remove what felt like a cloth from around his head.\n\n\n please open your eyes Michael and tell me what you see she said.\n\nMichael open his eyes and was amazed at what he saw all around him he seemed to be in the  futuristic operating room that he observed from the other side of the mirror however, now he could see it much better.\n\n the room was full, of different gadgets that he couldn’t even comprehend the scale of\nBut the thing that shocked Michael the most was the floating text and icons floating around him\nAnd he’s saw apps and  advertisements and many other things but that was not as concerned at the moment and instinctively with a wave of his hand  all of the floating text, images, and icons vanished like they were never there.\n\n\nStanding on his right side was a girl in a silvery dress that was made of some type of material he had never seen before but it looked similar to some kind of metallic cotton\nThe girl who he now knew to be was carnella was about 5.7 feet in height.\n\n\nMichael  looked over beside the girl  and saw what appeared to be an android \nThe android was about 4  feet tall with  bluish skin and a human like face that was very beautiful.",

        "text": "\nListen reddit! I know your going to judge me but I don’t care, you must feel what I feel. I have to tell this story before I can’t anymore \n\nLet me tell you dear reader, karma is very much real and she is a bitch. I’m going to recount this shot for shot for you, because you need to suffer with me!\n\n Oh and to clarify, I am a horrible person, and at this point I don’t care. \n\n————————————————————————\n\nSo recently, newspaper sales have been plummeting. As someone who works for the New York Times, this is a bit troubling. I’ve never given it much thought though, I've just been doing my job.\n\n However, to try and entice the public, we’re doing a short story contest! So here I am stuck picking from the newest submissions. I was shuffling through some rather boring stories. I had just put down one about a cat and a mouse becoming friends when I saw the title. \n\n“I hide in the walls.”\n\nInstantly a chill spread throughout me. A shock of terror striking. The title was certainly… something. I leaned forward and shuffled through the story to find the author's name. There was no name. A creepy story with an anonymous writer. I instantly threw the story in the trash, it brought back… some troubling memories. \n\nI shook off the feeling that someone was looking at me and continued reading the stories. I eventually decided on a story written by a third grader. It was a very cute story about her pet dog who saved her from a fire when she was young. Happy with my choice, I went home.\n\nThere's nothing better than a hot bath after work, that's my personal motto anyway. After my bath, I made dinner, watched TV, and eventually got ready for bed. I shut the lights off and collapsed into bed. \n\nI tossed and turned trying to find a comfortable spot. For some reason I just could not relax tonight. I found a good spot and began to drift off, right when the dreamworld was tugging my consciousness I heard a noise:\n\nTap… tap… tap… tap… tap… tap… tap… tap…\n\nWhoever was tapping allowed each tap to fully echo through the room before the next tap. The sound continued. I ran over to the lightswitch and flicked the light on. I must be dreaming. I pinched myself, surprised when I felt the protest of pain. \n\nThe tap continued. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end, tears threatened my eyes, my face felt frozen, I felt a sunken feeling underneath my rib cage, and a strong itch at the back of my mind was screaming for me to turn around. I did. Nobody was there, yet the sickening noise dragged on. Then a knock. \n\nKnock, knock, knock, knock \n\nI live alone now.\n\nThey were knocking from inside of the wall. \n\nA static terror bolted through me, working its way from my head to my legs. I heard a shuffling noise. I whirled around in terror, sucking in a gasping breath. \n\nA slow drag of nails scraped. Over and over. \n\nI felt a string tug between my shoulder blades, spinning me around the room, surrendering to every natural instinct that could get me out of this. Scrape, scrape, scrape. \n\nI covered my ears. The person began pounding on the wall. Louder and louder, repeating the same pattern. Boom, boom-boom, boom, boom-boom. Horror ran through my spine and spread through my veins. I was frozen in place, my hands limp at my sides.\n\n“Hi”\n\nIt spoke\n\nA little shriek escaped me. The voice was high pitched and girly, like a young childs. \n\n“Do you think you can help me?”\n\nMy hands trembled, tears now flowing down my cheeks. \n\n“Mommy said that I was annoying her.”\n\nI sank to the floor and started to bawl.\n\n“She said that maybe I would stop bothering her in the wall.”\n\nI shrieked. \n\n“Of course, you remember, don’t you mommy?”\n\n\n“I’m sorry!” I screamed “I’m sorry! I didn’t-”\n\n“Don’t lie. You told me that good people don’t lie.”\n\n“I-”\n\n\n“I used to tap on the table, that made you angry.” \n\nShe tapped. I cried even harder. \n\n“Seems to still bother you, huh?” \n\nI sucked in a gasping breath.\n\n“I knocked on your door in the middle of the night, I felt sick.”\n\n“Please, stop!”\n\n“You had a hole in the wall, all ready for me, dragged me over to it, I grabbed for the wall, my nails scraped.”\n\nThe memories flooded my head, I screamed. \n\n“You remember? Putting the dresser in front of the hole so I couldn’t get out? Do you remember me pounding on the walls screaming for help?”\n\nI glanced over to the dresser, my visions flicked, the vision of her screaming. \n\n“Yes.” \n\n“That's what I thought.” \n\nA giggle that very much belonged to my daughter came from the wall. \n\n“I do hope you get used to this.” \n\nEvery night, the torture happened, first a tap, then a knock, a scrape, and pounding. I can’t take it! I can’t take it! This is my last night alive. I’m going into that wall, and I’m never coming out.\n\n I’ll hold my daughter once more, I’ll hold her decaying body and watch it taunt me until my last breath.",

        "text": "Adventures through the timestream, book 1: the endangered planet\nCopyright 2022, Kaeleb Heck\n Chapter 1:  shifting  through time the story starts on a Tuesday afternoon with Michael a 24-year-old guy from San Francisco, California\nMichael  was a normal guy with a normal job as a software engineer.\n\n he had no friends and no  love life  to  to speak of.\n\nHe was not an ugly guy.\n In fact, he was very handsome at about 6 feet tall with a short cropped beard and green eyes.\n\nThe reason he did not have friends, or a lady companion is because he liked, escaping into the Internet, most of his time.\n  Michael walked into the dimly lit bedroom, and before he could even take two steps into the room his eyes were caught by the brilliantly glowing mirror propped against the wall of his bedroom.\n\nMichael’s mouth fell open with a silent exclamation,  his drink, sandwich, and cell phone crashed to the floor, with a tremendous crash and a  tinkle of breaking glass.\n\nMichael was not a coward however, and with a shake of his head he gathered his composure, and walked over to the glowing mirror which intrigued him.\n\nThe mirror was a full length mirror that Michael had had passed down in his family for the last three centuries or so he could remember.\n\nThe frame of the Majestic mirror was decorated with gold-trim wave patterns and ancient runes that he could not distinguish.\n\nAs he peered  into the looking glass he was amazed at what his eyes were seeing.\n\nMichael was astonished.\n Instead of seeing the reflection of his bedroom like he would expect he saw a long glowing passageway extending for a few meters.\n\nAt the end of this passage, he saw what looked like to him to be  a futuristic surgical suite.\n\nMichael then closed and open his eyes, and performed a series of reality checks. However, when he was finished, everything was still there.\n\nWith a start, Michael reached out a trembling hand and attempted to touch the mirror however, his hand passed directly through the silvery surface.\n\nFour a  minute Michael debated with himself whether he should go through the glowing portal or not, and with a shrug of his shoulders he walked through and everything faded to black.\n\n\nChapter 2 : the awakening Michael woke to the prick of a needle in his neck and a robotic voice.\n\nHe is awake said a gentle robotic voice on his left side.\n\nHe then heard a human voice which sounded to him maybe like a   female. “wow carnella our procedure seems to have worked we have successfully brought back a healthy human from the middle of the  21st century”\nMichael had enough of everyone talking around him and he still couldn’t see anything it was still pitch black.\n\n\nWith a stretch Michael spoke what in  the world  is going on here?\n Where the hell am I at?\n\n He then heard the android\n\nOn his left say  “My name is magnolia, we have managed to shift you from your base reality to this parallel reality, which is  further along in the timestream”.\n\n \nThere is a major conflict that troubles our hajiminy star  system and that is \nwhy we  have shifted you forward in the  timestream because we need your assistance, said carnella.\n \nWe have brought you forward to the year 2345\nPlease do not stress yourself.\n\n in a few minutes your mind should adjust to the implant that will help you survive better in our time.\n\nMichael was so confused, and he wanted to get to the bottom of this.\n\nWhat implant are you talking about.\n\n   \n(Carnella said)We have outfitted your body with our state of the art cybernetic implants which will allow  your mind to Connect and interphase with all devices and networks in our timeline, and which will allow you to do way more things than you are remotely used to in your time.\n\nI am very sorry, but you might feel a brief bit of pain while we activate the systems, but trust me it is so worth it.\n\n\nchapter 3: the implants  Michael then felt a blinding pain in his head as the girl carnella remove what felt like a cloth from around his head.\n\n\n please open your eyes Michael and tell me what you see she said.\n\nMichael open his eyes and was amazed at what he saw all around him he seemed to be in the  futuristic operating room that he observed from the other side of the mirror however, now he could see it much better.\n\n the room was full, of different gadgets that he couldn’t even comprehend the scale of\nBut the thing that shocked Michael the most was the floating text and icons floating around him\nAnd he’s saw apps and  advertisements and many other things but that was not as concerned at the moment and instinctively with a wave of his hand  all of the floating text, images, and icons vanished like they were never there.\n\n\nStanding on his right side was a girl in a silvery dress that was made of some type of material he had never seen before but it looked similar to some kind of metallic cotton\nThe girl who he now knew to be was carnella was about 5.7 feet in height.\n\n\nMichael  looked over beside the girl  and saw what appeared to be an android \nThe android was about 4  feet tall with  bluish skin and a human like face that was very beautiful.\n     \n \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow my community, subscribe to my social media‘s, and become a fan for the next riveting chapter, we will follow Michael through the New World of Teron-Proxima that he’s stumbled  into\nPlease subscribe to my YouTube channel Mr. blindbandit",

        "text": "I apologize for my absence. Need I say more than having a new baby is so hard? Help is hard to come by, especially when the father is no longer in the picture. He decided the responsibility of fatherhood was too much and threw himself off of a bridge; no matter. Control is one of the few things we don’t have over these types of situations. Me, I’m settling into motherhood just fine. \n\nHe’s asleep now, for the first time since he was brought into our home. When He’s Awake, he’s such a handful. i’ve tried everything. Puppets, lullabies, television, and he’s just so restless. Me and him have had a hard time setting bedtime boundaries. \n\nHe Reads too. My Mind was so full of nothing at that age, he truly is a wonder and a blessing. I have to review what we read together. Carefully, of course; he wants to Write eventually. This is something that as a mother, I will always support; he wants it. I Need it for him, because I am his mother. \n\nPolice came and went after that horrible day, he sat on my hip and assured me that everything would be okay. Called his dad crazy. Kill yourself just because you don’t want to be a dad? The Child is the best thing you could ever have in life, Save having an absolute genius for a kid. Me and him are about as close knit as a mom and kid ever could be. \n\nAnyway, it sounds like he’s getting up. Helping their child is something a mother must do. Please be afraid to comment on this post, as I am sure he will read it over. I Am assuring you here and now, he is perfect. In other words, I am safe. Danger is not in this home, promise!\n\nHe asked me to add some things before I send this update. Please be aware the following information is not part of the above message. First, he asked me to name him. I decided on Ky, because that is my middle name and would’ve been my name if I was a boy. \n\nBecause of him, I have reconciled with my mom. He loves hearing me talk to her. He tells me what questions to ask her, and for the first time in ten years, I talked to my mom for *hours.* He says that family is so important, and that we can’t afford to lose another just because they don’t understand his gifts. \n\nLike I mentioned before, he doesn’t need more than a few minutes of sleep every few days. Imagine all of the time he will have in adulthood to explore his hobbies! He’s already got me into doing yoga at the local mom’s center. \n\nHe never leaves my hip, it’s almost like he’s attached! Even when I try to put him down, he holds on for dear life. He’s got an incredibly strong grip for a baby, and an incredibly strong mind as well. I am so proud of all of his accomplishments already. He and I will live a perfect life together. He will never abandon me like I did my own mom, and he will make sure that I do not ever abandon her again. In fact, he suggested we sell my townhome and move in with her. I thought that was a wonderful idea. Being a single mom is so hard. But his deep, hearty laugh makes it all worth it. \n\nTrying to work on the computer with a baby on your hip is just so hard. I quit my job so that I could always be there and give him the attention he deserves. He suggested this too, especially since I have such great savings. He says when he gets big and stronger, I can go back to work. He just has to make sure I’ll be a good mom even when he’s away.\n\nHe eats so, so much. It’s hard to keep up. Truly, between the amount he drains from me and the four gallons of milk I have gone through since he came home, I am amazed at his stomach capacity. He’s already got two teeth showing too, but they're molars. I always thought that the front set came in first. But, at least he can eat solid food. He loves meat, especially pork. He says it tastes like the inside of my tummy. How cute that he remembers that. \n\nHe also remembers how bad I didn’t want to be a mom, and how hard I tried to get rid of him. It makes him very sad. If you’re thinking about having an abortion because you think you don’t want kids, let me tell you firsthand how much I love mine. He is my anchor to a better life. \n\nAnd wow, has he grown. I mean, I’ve had this kid for less than a week and he’s already ten pounds heavier and literally growing by the minute. And he’s starting to talk out loud too. He said his first word today - mama (of course). He says that by tomorrow, he thinks he will be able to stand up on his own. By the end of next week, he could be running. I told him he should be an athlete when he grows up, but he said that would take too much time away from family life. I assured him that I would come to all of his games, and he said he knew I would and that he wouldn’t have it any other way. \n\nOh! One last thing, he’s so excited about this: I am trying for another baby! He said he wanted a little sibling, and even though I thought that one baby was already so much to handle, he convinced me otherwise. I have a consultation with a doctor at a sperm clinic next week. He helped me do all the research, and is dead set on finding someone who looks just like his dad. \n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zvw6wd/i_didnt_want_to_be_a_mom_too_late_i_guess/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

        "text": "I was happy at one point in my life casually browsing Reddit and posting to a few subs, one day took my by surprise I had received a message from someone regarding my post and they had a similar experience, so we began talking, Days led into months and so on.\n\nAbout 6 months in I was really digging this girl, Stacy seemed like a really cool down to earth person at first, we had similar interests and everything we talked about seemed to be online with each other's thoughts, it was a great time.\n\nAfter another 6 months Stacy messaged me and asked if I'd be willing to meet her in person I was shocked at first, a girl asking my lonely ass to meet, I thought there's something not right about it but I put it to the back of my mind because I was so desperately lonely I decided to throw caution to the wind.\n\nWe had shared pics and had a few video calls at this point and she was definitely my type of girl, so we decided to meet at a local coffee shop, I won't lie I was incredibly nervous but also excited to finally meet the girl of my dreams.\n\nIt hit about 13:05 when the door to the coffee shop opened and there she stood but there was a big change in her appearance, dressed in all black gothic style clothing, her hair sat gracefully on her shoulders and listened in the light, as she swept a hand through her hair, her face became clearer, a little bit of black eyeliner and lipstick with the same piercings I'd seen before, now this appearance to some is off putting but I honestly thought she was beautiful.\n\nShe walked through the shop turning a few heads to say the least, partly judgemental and partly in awe, because she rocked the look, she sat down and I asked her what she wanted, a hot chocolate with cream and marshmallows with all the trimming, I ordered her drink and we sat and began talking.\n\nWe talked for hours, I mean hours, all the way up until the shop had to usher us out the door, we both left laughing and then she turned to me and said I want you to stay at mine tonight, now usually I'd be a little wary of this situation but all caution being thrown to the wind I decided to say yes.\n\nI couldn't help but think about how lucky I was, random beautiful goth girl taking me of all people back to her place, I was over excited about this situation, after a little walk, we stood outside her place and she stopped me before walking inside.\n\nShe smiled at me and said \"My place is a little odd compared to most places, so please don't be shocked\" I said \"You haven't scared me off yet\" thinking back to certain topics of conversations that should have been a big red flag, I let them flicker through my mind without processing them properly.\n\nShe opened the door and this place was off the chain, she had animal skulls, human skulls and various other occult items all over the place, the walls were painted black and there was a large pentagram on the floor but none of this really bothered me, it should have but it didn't at all, I walked inside and just said \"wow  this place looks amazing\"\n\nShe brushed past my arm and I could see the smile on her face, as she walked towards the sofa and patted it lightly with her hand, which disarmed any bad thoughts I had about her and for further hours we sat and talked, not one of us even looked at our phones, which I thought was great, especially in this day and age.\n\nAfter a little bit she offered me a drink and something to eat, I gratefully accepted the meal and drink without a second thought, I honestly was beginning to fall hard for this amazing girl who only a year ago was a simple message in my DMs.\n\nAfter finishing what was an amazing meal, she sat there just staring at me, \"Do you love me?\" She asked, I pondered the response for a few minutes and it just came out \"Yes\". She smiled and a grin struck her face in a different almost evil way \"Good\" and that's when it happened I became instantly sleepy to the point I realised I'd been drugged with something, I stood up to leave and as I did I fell to the ground hard, crashing into her coffee table and rolling over to see her stood over me, I passed out.\n\nWhen I finally woke, my hands and were bound and I was sat there naked, I could see my clothing piled up,folded neatly to one side and Stacy sat in a chair in front of what I can only say was some sort of vigil, I called out \"Stacy! What the hell is going on!\" Only her head turned and with an almost devilish grin \"You are mine now, you said it yourself, 'You love me and I, I love you\"\n\nI tried to free my hands but she had actually done a good job on making sure that I couldn't. It was at that point she stood up and began singing to me, I couldn't tell you the song but it mesmerized me until about half way through she began ripping her clothes off, as she stood there naked she wretched forwards and backwards still singing until her hands became sort of like eagle claws and her back split open to reveal wings, her teeth grew to fangs and a little blood trickled down from where they split her lip.\n\nShe suddenly stopped and stared at me, she began moving closer but slowly at this point the full panic of what was happening set in, stupidly I wasted my energy trying to get out of the makeshift restraints, I felt her claw snip my hands free, I fell forwards and quickly turned around \"What are you!?\" She smiled and simply said \"I am a siren and you said you love me so now I'm going to make you stay with me forever\"\n\nAs she spoke I managed to get the restraints off my ankles, I started darting around in full flight mode trying to figure a way out of there to no avail, I began to think about giving up each turn I took she was standing right there, waiting for me to embrace her, I didn't know what else to do at this point, I decided to just give up, I walked over to her and she extended her arms out quickly grabbing me and pulling me in, her teeth felt cold as she rested her head against me.\n\n\"Oh it's true, it's true, you do love me\" she whispered, I asked her what would happen now, she said nothing and we just embraced each other for a while as the day grew darker, I asked her if it was ok if I just went to the shop, she said \"I'm not kidnapping you, you can do as you please as long as you return\" she laughed \"I will my love\" I laughed back with a crooked grin.\n\nAs I walked down the stairs I almost broke down, the sight of her after the transformation  in reality was horrific to me, the sounds of her bones crunching and redeveloping and the sound of her skin ripping open, the way her jaw disconnected almost like a snakes but each thing you could hear the bones grinding and clicking together.\n\nAs the fresh air hit me I felt relieved the panic had subsided and the adrenaline had worn off, now I thought what do I do, do I run or should I return. I ran, that day I ran and I haven't stopped, I'm still looking over my should even now, she's still out there but I didn't think going to the police would help, the story was so far fetched I mean she did drug me so what if it was a hallucinogenic or something, the police would never help regardless.\n\nIf I'm still here in a few weeks, I'll post again but hopefully she'll never find me, posting this here may cause her to find me I'm not sure, but I'll post if I can.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a 14-year-old girl living in the woods with my parents, I've always felt a bit isolated and disconnected from the rest of the world. But I never could have imagined the horrors that would unfold on the night of the blood moon.\n\nIt started out like any other evening. My parents and I were sitting around the fire, roasting marshmallows and telling ghost stories. But as the night wore on, I started to feel a strange energy in the air. The air was heavy and thick, and I could feel a sense of unease creeping over me.\n\nAs the moon rose higher in the sky, my parents began to act strange. They started yelling at me for no reason, their faces contorting into grotesque, unfamiliar shapes. It was like they weren't even themselves anymore.\n\nI was terrified, and I knew I had to get out of there. I grabbed my backpack and ran as fast as I could through the woods, not looking back even once. I don't know where I'm going, or what I'm going to do when I get there. All I know is that I can't stay with my parents on this night of the blood moon. I have to keep running, no matter what.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I ran through the dark, twisted woods, panting and gasping for air, I knew I had to keep moving. I couldn't stay in one place for too long, not with my parents lurking somewhere behind me, their faces twisted into those grotesque, unfamiliar shapes.\n\nBut as I stumbled through the underbrush, I suddenly collided with something hard and unyielding. I fell to the ground with a cry of pain, my backpack tumbling to the ground beside me.\n\nAs I looked up, I saw a shadowy figure looming over me. At first, I was terrified, thinking it was one of my parents coming to drag me back to our twisted little campsite. But as the figure leaned closer, I saw that it was a man - a kind, middle-aged man with a gentle face and piercing blue eyes.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked, offering me a hand to help me up. \"What are you doing out here all alone in the woods?\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, not sure if I could trust this stranger. But something about his kind eyes and gentle voice made me feel like I could. So I told him the whole story - about the blood moon, and how my parents had turned into monsters before my very eyes.\n\n\"I know it sounds crazy,\" I said, my voice trembling. \"But I swear it's all true.\"\n\nThe man listened intently, nodding his head as I spoke. When I was finished, he patted me on the shoulder and said, \"Come on, let's get you out of here. You can stay with me for the night, and we'll figure out what to do in the morning.\"\n\nI nodded, tears of relief streaming down my face. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, I felt safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the kind stranger led me through the woods and out onto the main road, I couldn't help but feel a sense of hope and relief. I was finally going to get help, and maybe even find a way to escape from my monstrous parents once and for all.\n\nBut as we approached the city limits, I started to get a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach. The streets were deserted, and the buildings around us seemed abandoned and decrepit. It was like the whole city had been forgotten by the rest of the world.\n\nThe man led me to a large, crumbling building on the edge of town. \"This is the mental health center,\" he said, as he opened the door and gestured for me to go inside.\n\nI hesitated for a moment, not sure if I wanted to go in. There was something about the place that seemed off - almost as if it was haunted. But the man insisted, and I knew I had nowhere else to go. So I reluctantly stepped inside, my heart racing with fear.\n\nThe inside of the center was even creepier than the outside. The walls were peeling and the floors were creaky and uneven. It was like no one had been there in years.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" the man said, sensing my unease. \"The staff here are very experienced. They'll be able to help you with whatever you're going through.\"\n\nI nodded, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was very wrong. I knew I had to find a way to escape, before it was too late.\n\nBut as the days passed and I was kept locked up in that creepy, abandoned building, I started to wonder if I'd ever make it out alive. I had to find a way to escape, before it was too late.\n\nTwo nights after I arrived at the mental health center, I woke up in the middle of the night with a fierce thirst. I had been having trouble sleeping, and my mouth felt like it was full of cotton.\n\nSo I crept out of my small, dingy room and made my way down the dimly lit hallway to the communal kitchen. I was hoping to find a glass of water, or maybe even a bottle of juice if I was lucky.\n\nAs I approached the kitchen, I noticed that the door was slightly ajar. I pushed it open, and a wave of musty, damp air hit me in the face. The room was dark and shadowy, the only light coming from a small window high up on the wall.\n\nI made my way over to the sink and turned on the tap, hoping that the water wouldn't be too rusty. As I waited for it to fill up, I suddenly heard a noise behind me.\n\nI spun around, heart racing, but I couldn't see anything in the darkness. I was about to turn back to the sink when I saw a shadowy figure standing in the corner of the room. It was tall and thin, with long, spindly arms and a featureless face.\n\nI froze, too terrified to move. I knew I should run, but my feet felt like they were glued to the ground. I was trapped, with no way out.\n\nAs the shadow figure advanced towards me, I closed my eyes and prayed for it to be over quickly. But just as it reached out to touch me, I heard a loud crash and the room was suddenly flooded with light.\n\nI opened my eyes to see the shadow figure disappearing into the walls, as if it had never been there at all. And standing in the doorway, bathed in the light of a flashlight, was the kind man who had brought me here.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said, taking my hand. \"We have to get out of here. This place is not safe for you.\"\n\nI nodded, tears streaming down my face. I knew he was right. I had to get out of this creepy, abandoned mental health center, no matter what.\n\nAs I sit here at my computer, typing out this story, I can't help but feel like my life doesn't make any sense. I've gone through so much in such a short time - the blood moon, my parents turning into monsters, the creepy mental health center with its shadowy figures lurking in the corners. It's all so confusing and overwhelming, and I feel like I'm trapped in some kind of nightmare.\n\nI don't know who to trust, or where to turn. The kind man who saved me still won't tell me who he is, or where he came from. He avoids contact with me as much as possible, and I'm starting to wonder if he thinks I'm crazy too.\n\nI keep getting the sense that someone, or something, is watching me. I feel like I'm in danger, but I don't know from what. My life doesn't make any sense, and I don't know how to make it right again.",

        "text": "I was happy at one point in my life casually browsing Reddit and posting to a few subs, one day took my by surprise I had received a message from someone regarding my post and they had a similar experience, so we began talking, Days led into months and so on.\n\nAbout 6 months in I was really digging this girl, Stacy seemed like a really cool down to earth person at first, we had similar interests and everything we talked about seemed to be online with each other's thoughts, it was a great time.\n\nAfter another 6 months Stacy messaged me and asked if I'd be willing to meet her in person I was shocked at first, a girl asking my lonely ass to meet, I thought there's something not right about it but I put it to the back of my mind because I was so desperately lonely I decided to throw caution to the wind.\n\nWe had shared pics and had a few video calls at this point and she was definitely my type of girl, so we decided to meet at a local coffee shop, I won't lie I was incredibly nervous but also excited to finally meet the girl of my dreams.\n\nIt hit about 13:05 when the door to the coffee shop opened and there she stood but there was a big change in her appearance, dressed in all black gothic style clothing, her hair sat gracefully on her shoulders and listened in the light, as she swept a hand through her hair, her face became clearer, a little bit of black eyeliner and lipstick with the same piercings I'd seen before, now this appearance to some is off putting but I honestly thought she was beautiful.\n\nShe walked through the shop turning a few heads to say the least, partly judgemental and partly in awe, because she rocked the look, she sat down and I asked her what she wanted, a hot chocolate with cream and marshmallows with all the trimming, I ordered her drink and we sat and began talking.\n\nWe talked for hours, I mean hours, all the way up until the shop had to usher us out the door, we both left laughing and then she turned to me and said I want you to stay at mine tonight, now usually I'd be a little wary of this situation but all caution being thrown to the wind I decided to say yes.\n\nI couldn't help but think about how lucky I was, random beautiful goth girl taking me of all people back to her place, I was over excited about this situation, after a little walk, we stood outside her place and she stopped me before walking inside.\n\nShe smiled at me and said \"My place is a little odd compared to most places, so please don't be shocked\" I said \"You haven't scared me off yet\" thinking back to certain topics of conversations that should have been a big red flag, I let them flicker through my mind without processing them properly.\n\nShe opened the door and this place was off the chain, she had animal skulls, human skulls and various other occult items all over the place, the walls were painted black and there was a large pentagram on the floor but none of this really bothered me, it should have but it didn't at all, I walked inside and just said \"wow  this place looks amazing\"\n\nShe brushed past my arm and I could see the smile on her face, as she walked towards the sofa and patted it lightly with her hand, which disarmed any bad thoughts I had about her and for further hours we sat and talked, not one of us even looked at our phones, which I thought was great, especially in this day and age.\n\nAfter a little bit she offered me a drink and something to eat, I gratefully accepted the meal and drink without a second thought, I honestly was beginning to fall hard for this amazing girl who only a year ago was a simple message in my DMs.\n\nAfter finishing what was an amazing meal, she sat there just staring at me, \"Do you love me?\" She asked, I pondered the response for a few minutes and it just came out \"Yes\". She smiled and a grin struck her face in a different almost evil way \"Good\" and that's when it happened I became instantly sleepy to the point I realised I'd been drugged with something, I stood up to leave and as I did I fell to the ground hard, crashing into her coffee table and rolling over to see her stood over me, I passed out.\n\nWhen I finally woke, my hands and were bound and I was sat there naked, I could see my clothing piled up,folded neatly to one side and Stacy sat in a chair in front of what I can only say was some sort of vigil, I called out \"Stacy! What the hell is going on!\" Only her head turned and with an almost devilish grin \"You are mine now, you said it yourself, 'You love me and I, I love you\"\n\nI tried to free my hands but she had actually done a good job on making sure that I couldn't. It was at that point she stood up and began singing to me, I couldn't tell you the song but it mesmerized me until about half way through she began ripping her clothes off, as she stood there naked she wretched forwards and backwards still singing until her hands became sort of like eagle claws and her back split open to reveal wings, her teeth grew to fangs and a little blood trickled down from where they split her lip.\n\nShe suddenly stopped and stared at me, she began moving closer but slowly at this point the full panic of what was happening set in, stupidly I wasted my energy trying to get out of the makeshift restraints, I felt her claw snip my hands free, I fell forwards and quickly turned around \"What are you!?\" She smiled and simply said \"I am a siren and you said you love me so now I'm going to make you stay with me forever\"\n\nAs she spoke I managed to get the restraints off my ankles, I started darting around in full flight mode trying to figure a way out of there to no avail, I began to think about giving up each turn I took she was standing right there, waiting for me to embrace her, I didn't know what else to do at this point, I decided to just give up, I walked over to her and she extended her arms out quickly grabbing me and pulling me in, her teeth felt cold as she rested her head against me.\n\n\"Oh it's true, it's true, you do love me\" she whispered, I asked her what would happen now, she said nothing and we just embraced each other for a while as the day grew darker, I asked her if it was ok if I just went to the shop, she said \"I'm not kidnapping you, you can do as you please as long as you return\" she laughed \"I will my love\" I laughed back with a crooked grin.\n\nAs I walked down the stairs I almost broke down, the sight of her after the transformation  in reality was horrific to me, the sounds of her bones crunching and redeveloping and the sound of her skin ripping open, the way her jaw disconnected almost like a snakes but each thing you could hear the bones grinding and clicking together.\n\nAs the fresh air hit me I felt relieved the panic had subsided and the adrenaline had worn off, now I thought what do I do, do I run or should I return. I ran, that day I ran and I haven't stopped, I'm still looking over my should even now, she's still out there but I didn't think going to the police would help, the story was so far fetched I mean she did drug me so what if it was a hallucinogenic or something, the police would never help regardless.\n\nIf I'm still here in a few weeks, I'll post again but hopefully she'll never find me, posting this here may cause her to find me I'm not sure, but I'll post if I can.",

        "text": "A piece of coffee cake fell from Gertie's fork as she stared at me with rapt attention, wide eyed as I recounted my story from the night before. Her eyes were as round as the saucer that her teacup sat upon.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\"Bloody *hell!* Have you gone to the police?!\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Yes.\" I muttered, my hand rubbing worriedly at my lip. \"It was the first thing that I did.\"\n\n  \n\n\n*\"And?!\"*\n\n  \n\n\n\"And... they said they'd keep an eye on it.\"\n\n  \n\n\nGertie's fork clattered to her plate.\n\n  \n\n\n\"That's it? Someone broke into your house and possibly touched you whilst you slept a drunken night off and they'll, 'keep an eye on it'?!\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Gertie, what more can they do?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"I don't know! *Something!*\"\n\n  \n\n\nI glanced over at the till desk of the quaint cafe of our small village, then over at Bambi who was sitting with his head peeking out of the top of his open carrier backback on the chair in between Gertie and I. Cats weren't technically allowed in The Little Rose Teashop, however Bambi was an exception because the owners, Kathy and Bill, absolutely adored him. He had proven that he could be amongst civilized society in the village. All the locals knew Bambi.\n\nI took him everywhere.\n\n  \n\n\n\"The person didn't exactly break in.\" I reminded her.\n\n  \n\n\n\"So they used a key?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"The spare, yes.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"They knew where you kept it?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"So it would appear.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"So there's just... someone wandering around with a spare key to your house?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Well congratulations - that's terrifying.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Nothing gets past you, Gertie.\"\n\n  \n\n\nHer expression softened.\n\n  \n\n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm just worried about you. Have you called a locksmith?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"I have, yeah. He's coming in an hour.\"\n\n  \n\n\nGertie glanced at Bambi and gave his head a pat. \"I'll come with you. I don't think that you should be alone right now.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Thank you. I appreciate that.\"\n\n  \n\n\nShe nodded. \"So who dealt with you at the station, then?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Tilbury.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Tilbury? Jesus christ, nothing'll get done.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"He's not that bad.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"His police skills consist of eating biscuits from a tin and consuming mugs of gin, and all from the comfort of his desk.\"\n\n  \n\n\nI smiled a little at her analysis.\n\nKathy, the cheery owner of the teashop bustled over to our table with a bright smile.\n\n  \n\n\n\"How was everything today?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Amazing as always, Kathy. Thank you.\"\n\n  \n\n\nBambi pawed at her apron, knowing that she'd make a fuss of him as usual. He wasn't disappointed.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Well hello, Bambi! You're a handsome wee gentleman, aren't you?\"\n\n  \n\n\nHe rubbed his cheek against her hand and she beamed.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Does he want a wee chocolate croissant? I know that he likes those and I've just made some fresh. They're warm, just how he likes.\"\n\n  \n\n\nI sighed sarcastically. \"Oh, go on then. Though you're going to make him tubby if you keep that up, Kathy.\"\n\n  \n\n\nShe tutted warmly in a 'pish posh' manner and dashed off to the kitchen. I raised my eyebrows at Bambi and Kathy quickly returned with a chocolate croissant in a napkin. Bambi licked his chops but waited patiently, his eyes never leaving the bundle. Kathy smiled at him and held it out. While he scarfed it down, she lowered her tone.\n\n  \n\n\n\"It's all good and well now that we're all sat here in the daylight and the sunshine, but I had quite the fright last night, let me tell you.\"\n\n  \n\n\nMy eyes flickered up to Kathy. \"Oh?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Yeah.\" She nodded, staring down at the napkin in her hand. \"I'd woken in the night with the nagging feeling that I hadn't locked the cafe up. I know that these things are often unfounded, but I couldn't shake it, you know? So Bill put on his overcoat and popped across the road to the teashop to give me peace of mind.\n\nI was looking out of the window watching him walk towards the cafe door and I thought-\"  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI sat up a little.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Well, without sounding ridiculous - I thought that I saw someone lurking near the window of the cafe. But it was so dark that it was hard to tell. My heart was in my throat on seeing it though. I was worried for Bill.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Well, Bill tried the door and it turns out that my gut was right. I hadn't locked up. He checked the till and all of the money was still there. All was quiet though. He didn't see anyone. But then...\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"But then?\" I was hanging onto her every word.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Well, he was about to close up when he noticed that some of my baking was missing. The chocolate croissants actually. That's why I had to make more this morning. Bill knew because I'd made a big fuss about their presentation and they weren't where I'd placed them. I'd decorated the cake stands with blue ribbon and had demanded his opinion.\"\n\n  \n\n\nA slow chill ran up my spine.\n\n  \n\n\n\"When he came home he said, 'did you move those chocolate croissants that you baked today, love?' When I said no and was confused, he told me that they weren't on the counter where I'd made a song and dance about leaving them. I tutted and thought that he'd gotten mixed up, you know how he can be. Remember when he thought that Rennie Brown had his gardening shears? And it was actually Barty Turner that had had them all along? Well I thought that it was one of those times. But sure enough, when I opened up here this morning I instantly noticed that the croissants had gone walkabout. Just up and vanished! Bill swears that he saw no one, but after what I thought that I saw at the window last night, I can't help but think...\" She trailed off.\n\n  \n\n\nI knew exactly what she couldn't help but think.\n\n  \n\n\nKathy's story was still on my mind as Gertie and I made our way towards my house. Bambi stared out of the little window of his backpack as we walked.\n\n  \n\n\n\"It could just be a coincidence?\" I mumbled.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Maybe?\" Gertie offered, though she didn't sound too convinced.\n\n  \n\n\nA grey van with, 'Rodger and Sons, Locksmiths' sat in my driveway. As we approached, a man with dark hair and a mustache hopped out and extended his hand.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Keith Rodger, nice to meet you. My apologies for being a wee bit early.\"\n\n  \n\n\nHe had a warm smile and an even warmer hand. \"So you're wanting your locks changed then?\"\n\n  \n\n\nAs Mr Rodger got to work on changing the locks and Gertie nipped upstairs to the bathroom, I knelt down in the hall and let Bambi out of his backpack. Almost immediately, he sped off to the kitchen at the speed of light.\n\nI turned to the front door. Mr Rodger was on his knees peering at the door handle.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Mr Rodger, would you like some tea? I'm about to put the kettle on.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Aye, that'd be grand! Two sugars for me, please.\"\n\n  \n\n\nI nodded and made my way to the kitchen, where I found Bambi restlessly curving himself in and out of all of the chair legs around the table.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Bambi, what on earth are you d-\"\n\n  \n\n\nMy eyes fell to the table and I stopped.\n\nSitting on top of the scrubbed wood was a parcel. A parcel that definitely hadn't been there when I had left this morning. It was a neat parcel, tied with a blue ribbon.\n\nOn top of it sat a note.\n\n  \n\n\n*'For Bambi.'*\n\n  \n\n\nHeartbeat on hold, I untied the parcel with a shaking hand.\n\n  \n\n\nChocolate croissants. All stacked neatly on top of one another.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI immediately backed up into the wall.\n\nNo. No way.  \n\n\nI floored it back into the hallway.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\"Mr Rodger, how long were you sitting in my driveway?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"About fifteen minutes. Why?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Did you see anyone here at my house? Anyone at all?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"No, I didn't see anyone. Is... everything alright?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Gertie!\" I called shrilly.\n\n  \n\n\n\"What's going on? What is it?\" She came quickly down the stairs.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Look in the kitchen.\"\n\n  \n\n\nI remained silent as I waited for her to notice the croissants. When she came back out, her face was white.\n\n  \n\n\n\"They were here again?\" She whispered.\n\n  \n\n\nI met her eyes.\n\nShe was about to say something more, when something flickered across her face and she turned and quickly dashed back into the kitchen. I glanced down at the note still in my hand. I hadn't looked at the other side.\n\n  \n\n\n*'You know how he likes them.'*\n\n  \n\n\nThere was a sudden exclamation from the kitchen. Mr Rodger and I both rushed to the sound, and almost collided with Gertie in the process. She looked terror stricken.\n\n  \n\n\n\"You've been out of your house for hours at this point, yes?\" She asked me frantically.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"They could have burned your entire house down...\" She whispered.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Gertie, wh-\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"They didn't just leave the parcel.\n\nThey turned your oven on and left it.\"\n\n  \n\n\nI fresh wave of sickness washed over me.\n\nThis couldn't be happening...\n\n  \n\n\nMoving swiftly, I snatched up the stack of croissants and proceeded to throw the whole parcel into the bin outside.\n\nThey weren't staying in my house.\n\n  \n\n\nThe next morning, I found a dead squirrel by my bin outside. It had gotten into the croissants.\n\n  \n\n\nPoison.\n\n  \n\n\nPoison that had been meant for Bambi.",

        "text": " \n\nMy dog who was missing for five months returned home one morning.\n\nThis is an account of the first two nights at home with him.\n\nI was just about to put on a pot of coffee when something brown caught my eye right outside the kitchen window. At the first glance, I thought I must have left a coat out on the porch, but upon closer investigation, I realized it wasn’t a coat after all but something alive. I nearly leapt through the glass when it hit me that I recognized this animal.\n\nOn the porch was my dog Moose who disappeared one night five months ago. I’ll never forget that day. I came home from a late shift at work to a vacant house. Moose was always there to greet me at the door wagging his bushy tail with his tongue hanging slightly out of the left side of his jaw. That night though, it was deathly silent.\n\nMy attempts at calling his name were never answered. I searched my house front to back at least ten times. When that didn’t pan out I took my search outside where I covered the yard then expanded my search into the nearby woods. I never found a trace of where he might have gone. The following days were spent calling anyone I could think of and putting up posters everywhere, my efforts never bore any fruit. My soul was crushed. It was as if Moose vanished into thin air.\n\nNow though, there he was, curled up into a ball on my porch. I flung the door open with enough force it threatened to fly off the hinges and wrapped him in my arms. \n\nAfter I completed my warm reunion with my dog I pulled away and took a good look at him. I noticed that he hadn’t wagged his tail or made any sort of noise at all like he normally did which made me worry. Hugging him felt like I was wrapping my arms around a statue. Then I noticed something that made me scream.\n\nHis eyes were gone.\n\nThey looked like they had been deliberately carved out of his skull with a sharp object. Not like anything that could have been caused by an accident. A feeling of shock took over me which slowly dissolved into rage. What kind of twisted individual would do this to an animal? Worried for his health I decided my best plan of action would be to take him to the vet.\n\nMoose didn’t complain or emit any kind of emotion as I picked him up and put him in the back seat of my car, I honestly felt so bad for him. I had no idea what he might have gone through. I knew whatever had happened wasn’t pleasant at all. In my mind, I pictured a small rusted cage where he was tormented day and night. I bit down hard enough on my tongue that I tasted blood and tried my best to shake these kinds of thoughts out of my mind. It wasn’t going to do me any good to think like that. I was just happy Moose was back.\n\nAn uneasy feeling crept up me as I drove. My gaze shifted upward to the rearview mirror where I looked at Moose in the backseat. When I did I nearly swerved off the road. His head was tilted slightly at an odd angle that made it appear as if he was staring right back at me through his hollow eyes. I refrained from looking again for the rest of the ride. \n\nWe finally made it to the vet and I took him in. I got the vet to do a full workup on him to make sure nothing else was wrong with him. I was told he was in good health, aside from the fact that my dog was now blind. I received some medicine to help prevent any infection in his eyes and a pamphlet about living with a blind pet with tips on ways to improve their quality of life.\n\nI finally got Moose home after the long ride where I focused all my attention staring at the road. Letting Moose out of the car I noticed he seemed to have no problem whatsoever getting up the stairs and making his way into the house which sort of freaked me out. I just assumed he had memorized the layout because he’s been there so long.\n\nThat night I double-checked every possible way out of my house to be sure everything was locked. I didn’t just get him back so he could wander out an open window or door. Moose tried to follow me to bed like he always did but I lead him out and back to the couch. It was harder for me to find sleep than I anticipated. The feeling of eyes on me kept me up. I kept looking through my cracked bedroom door almost anticipating someone being there. Eventually though, my eyes closed and I drifted off.\n\nI woke up sometime early in the morning right as the sun was trying to breach the horizon. I reached over to check the time on my phone. Before I got to my phone a shape outlined in my doorway caught my attention. I turned my head to see Moose peeking through my cracked door looking dead at me.\n\nHe was barely illuminated but I could tell something was wrong about his outline. He looked bigger and his silhouette contained sharp protrusions shooting out of it. My heart rate raced upwards as I took in the sight before me. I guess he somehow noticed me looking because he slowly disappeared past the door. I heard floorboards bend and creak as he made his way back down the hall.\n\nI laid in my bed well after the sun came up. I cracked my door and tiptoed into the living room where I saw Moose sitting at the front door. He looked like he should. I felt like a fool for being scared of my own dog. His head turned as I entered and I walked over to pat him on the head. I was relieved I didn’t walk in to see some mutated horror that was once my dog. I tried to shift the blame on me still being half asleep.\n\nA little while later I got ready and left for work. Before I did I made sure Moose had some food and water then told him goodbye and left for my shift. The whole time I was at work I couldn’t help but think back on what I had seen that morning. I was just seeing things right?\n\nWhen I pulled into my driveway that afternoon I saw Moose looking out through the living room window at me. I say looking because the way his head was facing the window peering out at me in my car. It was like I could feel his gaze on me.\n\nI tried to ignore the goosebumps breaking out over my body as I got out of my car and headed for the front door. I watched the window as my foot landed on the first step and Moose hopped down from the window. I knew where he was heading.\n\nRight as I opened the door Moose was there. I was happy for a moment because it reminded me of how it always was before he vanished. I walked past him and gave him a pat on the head and told him he was a god boy. Sure he unnerved me a little but I could never be scared of Moose. I still remember the day my parents brought him home from the shelter. Since then he’s always been by my side.\n\nThe rest of the evening was uneventful. I cooked dinner and gave Moose a healthy scoop of dog food that he practically inhaled. Me and Moose sat in the living room with a movie playing. I have the weekend off so I had a few drinks during the movie. I noticed Moose was acting strange. Looking over at him he was stiff as a board peering out the window into the night. Like he was seeing something out there.\n\nWhen the movie finally ended along with my drinks Moose was still looking outside. I figured I would give the yard a once over with the flashlight to calm my nerves.  \n\nI grabbed the flashlight I kept under the sink and opened my front door to peer out into the abyss that my yard became after sundown. My house is positioned a good ways off from the road so the streetlamp’s glow doesn’t reach it. I scanned the tree line trying to see if anything was out there. Staring out I felt as if the trees themselves were looking back at me.\n\nAfter a few minutes of scanning back and forth I gave up. Whatever had Moose so spooked was beyond me. I got back inside and was getting ready for bed while Moose was still looking out the window. The only time he got up was to follow me into my bedroom, where I walked him back out to the couch and told him good night.\n\nThat night I woke up to Moose barking. I leaned over to grab my phone which told me it was 3:15 am. I hurried out of my room but froze halfway down the hallway. There was something off with Moose’s barking, it was like he was reaching a lower octave with each bark. It didn’t sound like it use to either. There was something predatorial about it. \n\nI slowly reached the end of the hall and peered around the wood paneling to get a look at where Moose was. When I saw Moose I nearly cried out but stopped myself with a hand over my mouth. He looked as if he had put on at least fifty pounds, but that wasn’t all though. His back was arched upward like a cat when it’s scared and parts of his spine had broken through the skin. Each exposed vertebra was sharp and serrated. His teeth were bared with his mouth curled into a snarl. I was so close to his bark now that it seemed to shake my very being.\n\nHis attention wasn’t on me though. His body was positioned facing the window, the same one he couldn’t take his eyes off earlier. This time it wasn’t only the darkness looking back beyond the window, it was accompanied by two wide eyes and a manic smile. My heart nearly jumped into my throat when I saw it. Then his gaze which was fixed on Moose shifted over to me and this time I wasn’t fast enough to suppress my scream. Moose began to turn around.\n\nHis head turned with his body as he stood mere feet from me. Empty sockets instantly locking with my eyes. He stared intently for what felt like forever until I heard a knock at the door followed by what sounded like stifled laughter. Like a hand clasped over a mouth only allowing little pieces of it escape.\n\nMy attention shifted from Moose to the front door as the knocking began to grow louder. Moose whirled around to face the door and began barking again. I just stood there shaking, I couldn’t move. My heartbeat was in my ears and I was sure it was about to give out. The laughing grew and grew as I saw the doorway start to give under this person's inhuman strength. \n\nThe door cracked and splintered as the man's blood-soaked hands began to appear from the other side. Moose was growling something guttural and low as the man reached one of his arms through the new hole in my door trying to open the door. Ripping off little ribbons of flesh as he worked his way down. Laughter exploded into the room as the man's grip finally found the inside lock and began to turn.\n\nHorror possessed my entire being as the door slowly opened up to show a man who was at least seven feet tall and bone-thin. He stood right in the doorway with one of his bloody hands over his mouth cackling like a disturbed child.\n\n“There you are!” \n\nThose were the only words that escaped his lips before Moose launched himself at him. The man went completely airborne when Moose struck him. He crashed through the railing on the porch and was swallowed up by the darkness beyond. Moose trailed right behind him into the abyss.\n\nI sat there with my now empty bladder as the laughter from the man and Moose's howls grew quieter and quieter. How long I sat motionless before moving again is anyone's guess.\n\nWhen I regained myself the only thing I could think of to do was call the police. I repeated the night's event, only leaving out the part about what happened to Moose. I doubt they would believe that. At the time I wasn’t sure I believed what I had seen either. I just told them that Moose chased him off and hasn’t come back.\n\nIt wasn’t long before I heard sirens and blue lights filled my yard. They asked me a few questions before a few officers went and scanned the surrounding woods and streets. I sat in my kitchen on a stool trying to process what had just happened. The sun rose before I heard any news, it didn’t calm my nerves in the slightest. I was told they found signs of a struggle in multiple locations but never found the man I described. There was no sign of Moose either. A detective gave me his number and told me to call him if anything came up and with that, I was alone in my house.\n\nTrying to do anything that would help me not be alone with my thoughts I decided to go pick up a new door. There was no way on earth I was sleeping without one. Well, that’s if I could even fall asleep.\n\nAfter a long and quiet trip to Lowes, I came home and started my work. It was slow at first as I had no carpentry experience whatsoever. Along with last night's events playing on an endless loop in my head. I found myself worrying about Moose. I was scared senseless the moment I saw him, but somehow I still thought of him as my dog. That night it felt like he was trying to protect me.\n\nI hoped he was okay. I wanted him back home, even though he wasn’t the same dog I knew before he disappeared. \n\nI finished putting in the new door the best I could. I was honestly proud of myself, it actually turned out better than I had hoped. The remainder of the day was spent periodically checking outside and doing chores around the house to quiet my thoughts.\n\nI had just finished eating dinner when I heard movement on my front porch. It was muffled behind the door but I could tell something was there. Slowly rising to my feet I grabbed a knife from the kitchen seeing that man’s crazed eyes and smile in my mind. My heart rate quickened as I held my breath while creeping up to the door. I was trying my best to stay calm but I was losing the battle.\n\nI slowly looked through the peephole in the door and dropped the knife to the ground. I didn’t see the man from the night before instead Moose was lying curled up on my welcome mat. All fear I had of him drained out of me as I opened the door and wrapped him in my arms just like I had done when he showed up a few days ago.\n\nThere were cuts all over him and a large gash in his leg which I quickly wrapped the best I could. Moose laid on the floor panting as I made him a meal and called the vet completely forgetting that they weren’t open. I just sat with him for a while to make sure he was okay until I noticed he had fallen asleep.\n\nIt’s been a few weeks since then now me and Moose are almost inseparable. Slowly as time passed he began to act more lively like he was before he vanished. I haven’t seen him in that form like he was that night. I still think about it every once in a while but then I take a good look at him and honestly it doesn’t really affect me anymore. I know Moose would never hurt me.\n\nEvery night I still make sure my house is secure. Not to keep Moose in but keep whoever showed up that night out. The police never found the man. I still dream of that face in my window and it makes my blood turn to ice.\n\nOne more thing that’s changed. After that night I no longer bar Moose from my bedroom at night. He follows me in and lays on the new dog bed I have placed right beside me.",

        "text": "Have you ever gotten a cookbook from one of those thrift stores? Probably. Most of us have. Or have been passed down in the family? Well, this story will make you reconsider.\n\nWe will start our story with Ruth. Ruth is in her early 20s and just starting to get into baking. So, she did what any new baking enthusiast would do. She popped over to a thrift store to find a good used cookbook. After browsing awhile, she found one. The perfect mix of vegan, and non-vegan meals. It wasn't very old or worn out. She checked the price sticker and it read, \"$2.50\"\n\"Score!\" She whispered to herself. A 400 page cookbook at $2.50 was a hell of a deal she thought. She made her purchase and went home. The first night she had the book she just ended up ordering a pizza while she read through it to find some good ideas to make. Everytime she would find a good one, she would dog ear the page, and continue on. Some of the recipes even gave household cleaning tips for the kitchen, which she thought was very helpful to have.\n\nShe went out to eat with her boyfriend on night 2, so she still hadn't made anything out of her book. But she was determined to make something soon. Things went on like this for a while. Procrastinating as we all tend to do.\n\nDay 16 came around and she was finally able to make a dish out of her book. Chicken parmesan was on the menu for the night. She got the meal made up, enjoyed it, cleaned up, and went to bed.\n\nThe next day while she was out running some errands she stopped for a bite to eat and a coffee at a Starbucks. She sat down and started scrolling through her phone's notifications, when she got a feeling that someone was watching her.\n\nShe looked up from her phone and saw a man a few tables down, and he was indeed staring at her. When the man noticed she was looking at him, he shied away with a charming smile. He then got up and approached Ruth.\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to stare, your just really beautiful\" he said\n\"Oh thank you!\" She replied\n\"Forgive me, but I gotta shoot my shot here. Are you available this week for dinner?\" He asked\n\"Oh sorry I have a boyfriend\" she answered.\n\"Well, can't blame me for trying. Have a nice day then\" he said with a smile as he walked back to his spot, grabbed his coffee and notebook and left.\n\nHe wasn't bad looking. Not usually the type Ruth would go for or anything, just a little too nerdy for her taste, but otherwise normal looking. But she had to at least applaud his effort.\n\nThe day went on and Ruth had forgotten about her coffee shop interaction.  After a while she returned home to her apartment to figure out what to eat for dinner that night. She was kinda feeling like something vegan. She flipped through her book to the vegan section. Cauliflower and Rice quesadillas sounded good. So, she made sure she had all the ingredients, which she did and got to work.\n\"First make sure to clean a bowl thoroughly with bleach\" read the recipe. Odd, but the author was pretty reputable, so Ruth didn't think twice about it. Better to have it completely clean anyway right?\n\"Next you will want to rinse your rice with hot water, then soak 1/4 cup of rice in vinegar\"\nRuth followed the instructions without hesitation. It must add some sort of zing to it right? Probably.  After letting the rice soak for about 15 minutes she dumped the rice and vinegar into the bleached bowl. And proceeded to step 3. While she was doing the third step she started to notice a strong harsh smell. She sniffed around to find the cause. It was the bowl. It smelled awful.\n\"Maybe this is what's supposed to happen?\" She thought. A knock came from the door, she left the kitchen to answer the door. Upon opening the door, there was no one there. She closed the door and went back to the kitchen to continue with her meal prep. While she was working on getting the cauliflower chopped up, she noticed her bleach and vinegar was gone. Did she put it away already? She must have. She brushed it off and kept at her cooking. Next step was to turn on the stove. She went over and turned on her electric stove too high. The smell from that bowl seemed to be getting worse and it was getting hard to breathe. Maybe she should set it out on her balcony?\n\nShe went to pick up the bowl and realized it was now filled to the rim with liquid, the bleach and vinegar bottles were in the trash empty next to the counter where the bowl had sat.\n\"What the hell?\" She asked herself as her breathing became more laboring. She started towards the balcony door to open it, something wasn't right. She could feel herself growing weaker as her breathing got worse. She reached the door and tried ripping open the sliding door, but it wouldn't budge. She checked the lock, but it was unlocked. She kept trying the door, until she realized a 2X4 had been placed against the handle outside to prevent it from opening. She was trapped. She frantically started trying the windows, but they were somehow sealed shut. In a panic, she summoned all the strength she had and hobbled towards the door as the chlorine gas filled the apartment. As she neared the door her heart dropped. A man in an all black leather hazmat looking suit was blocking her escape. He was wearing a supplied air respirator that took up his whole face. She saw nothing but his eyes. They looked familiar.  Her vision faded, then she collapsed on the ground. Her breathing grew shallow, as her vision slowly faded, she saw the man squat down next to her looking in her eyes. Her hearing faded along with her vision, and as she slowly stopped breathing she heard the intruder laughing quietly.\n\nAfter a minute the intruder checked for a pulse, but there was none. Ruth was dead. The intruder drug her body to the kitchen, and staged her body to wear it looked like a household accident had occurred by mixing the wrong chemicals. He fished out the rice with a strainer and another bowl, rinsed out the bowl and put it back, all while leaving the chemical mixture in the original bowl on the counter. He put a sponge in to really make it look like an accident. The last thing he did after removing the rods and boards he had placed into the doors and windows was grab the cookbook. He climbed down the fire escape from her balcony, removed his suit when he reached the ground, put it back in a bag he left earlier and left. Police found Ruth the next evening. Her death was ruled an accident. They couldn't figure out why she mixed the bleach and vinegar. No evidence of foul play was found. After a few days, a nice young lady by the name of Jaime was sitting in a Starbucks.\n\nShe felt as if someone was looking at her. She looked up, and a normal looking guy, with a slight nerdiness was looking at her. He shied away with a charming smile. He finished his coffee and slung his shoulder bag on and walked towards the door. As he passed Jaime a big cook book fell out of his bag and landed next to Jaime's feet. She had her ear buds so she didn't even hear it thud. After she finished her homework, she packed up her laptop and started to leave when she noticed a cookbook. She flipped through a few pages and decided to keep it. After all, it was the perfect mixture of vegan and non-vegan recipes.",

        "text": "I never believed in curses, at least not until I inherited my uncle's old mansion. It was a beautiful, sprawling estate with a rich history, but as I began to explore the property, I discovered a strange painting hanging in the attic.\n\nIt was a portrait of a woman, with piercing green eyes and long, flowing hair. There was something unsettling about the way she seemed to stare out at me, as if she could see into my soul. And as I looked closer, I noticed strange symbols etched into the frame and the faint smell of incense in the air.\n\nI tried to ignore the painting and focus on the rest of the mansion, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was watching me. And as the days passed, strange things began to happen. Doors would open and close on their own, and I would hear whispers and footsteps in the empty rooms.\n\nI tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination, but the occurrences became more and more frequent. And then, one night, I woke up to find a figure standing at the foot of my bed. It was the woman from the painting, her green eyes glowing with hatred. She reached out a hand towards me, and I woke up with a start, my heart racing.\n\nI knew then that I had to get rid of the painting. But as I tried to remove it from the wall, I discovered that it was impossible to budge. It was as if it was rooted to the spot, and any attempt to destroy it only seemed to make the occurrences worse.\n\nI turned to a local occult expert for help, and she told me that the painting was cursed. It had belonged to a powerful sorceress, and anyone who looked upon it was doomed to suffer her wrath. The only way to break the curse was to find the sorceress's remains and perform a ritual to lay her spirit to rest.\n\nI wasn't sure if I believed in such things, but I knew I had to do something. And so, with the help of the occult expert and a group of brave friends, we set out to find the sorceress's grave. It was a long and dangerous journey, taking us deep into the heart of the wilderness. We encountered all sorts of obstacles along the way, from wild animals to treacherous weather.\n\nBut we were determined to find the sorceress's grave and break the curse. And after weeks of searching, we finally found it hidden in a secret underground chamber. The grave was guarded by all sorts of supernatural beings, but we fought our way through them and reached the sorceress's remains.\n\nWe performed the ritual and watched as the curse was lifted and the painting crumbled to dust. The mansion was finally at peace, and I was able to sleep peacefully in my bed once again. But the memory of that terrifying journey stayed with me forever, and I never forgot the power of curses and the supernatural.",

        "text": "The storm was immense and the waves crashing against the shoreline seemed to shake the ground beneath me. The wind was so powerful I thought it would tear the lighthouse down. The light of the lighthouse disappeared into the night. The thunders drowned out the crash of waves and sounded like a thousand drums beating in a fierce battle. Rain poured down like a waterfall, and lightning bolts streaked across the sky, lighting up the ocean for a brief moment just before the thunder fell like a hammer on the shore.\n\nFear ran through my veins as I desperately hoped that the lighthouse would shield me from the raging storm. I was considering leaving the top floor and going down to the lowest one, just in case, but I was praying that the storm would die down soon.\n\nPeople usually wonder why I chose to live in a lighthouse. The truth is, I wanted to be alone, surrounded by peace and quiet. It didn't take me long to feel at home here, and now I embrace every moment of it.\n\nHere, on one of the Shetland Islands, I am far away from the everyday hustle and bustle of town but that doesn't bother me - being so near the sea more than makes up for it. Every morning I go down the winding stairs to the shoreline, cup of coffee in hand, to take in the view and be grateful for my current situation.\n\nLiving here can feel like I'm cut off from the rest of the world, but at least I have access to the Internet that way, I'm still able to keep in touch with my loved ones.\n\nThat night, the storm did not want to dissipate and the building began to tremble, so I decided to go to the ground floor out of fear that it might collapse. As I descended and reached the bottom, I let out a sigh of relief. That's when I heard the knock on the door.\n\n'Seriously?' I asked, wondering if it was a figment of my imagination. Who could possibly be knocking on my door during the storm of the century on a remote island?\n\nI heard the knock again and this time it seemed more urgent. My heart raced as I opened the door, and I saw a man standing outside, water streaming down his face. His eyes were heavy with exhaustion, his clothes drenched and clinging to his body, his breath coming in weak gasps and his face was pale and fatigued.\n\n'Uhm, can I help you?' I asked awkwardly.\n\nWithout saying anything, the man stepped inside and stopped.\n\n'Has he been here?' he asked.\n\nI furrowed my brow, unsure of what he meant.\n\n'Who?'\n\n'Nobody has been here before me?' he asked. His gaze shifted to the dust-covered sofa, his hands clenched and unclenched at his sides.\n\n\"You are the first person I've seen here in two months,\" I answered.\n\n“Are you sure he isn’t here?” he asked in disbelief, and then marched past me up the spiral staircase without waiting for a reply. His eyes darted around wildly, searching for something with great intensity.\n\nI raced up the stairs after him, yelling, \"Hey man, stop! Who do you think you are?\" My voice echoed in the darkness. When I reached the top of the lighthouse, I saw him standing in the middle of the room, surveying the area. His shoulders drooped in relief when he realized that it was just us.\n\n'Now tell me, what's going on!' I said, studying his face for signs of distress. He looked like he had been through a storm, and I felt a pang of empathy.\n\nHe didn't answer so I gave him a minute to collect his thoughts. We went back to the ground floor. I bustled around my mini kitchen, filling the kettle with water and setting it on the stove. I shuffled through cabinets until I found my favourite mug, and spooned out two teaspoons of loose-leaf tea leaves. When the water had boiled, I poured it into the mug, stirred it and placed it in his hands. He took a grateful sip and let out a sigh.\n\n'Where is your ship?' I questioned, peering out of the window. Blackness was all that greeted me, and the downpour was so intense it seemed like the glass might break from the force of the rain.\n\n'I have no ship,' the stranger said.\n\nThat's when I got a good look at him. His dark hair and blue eyes caught my attention. He was likely in his middle years, though I couldn't tell exactly how old he was. His eyes held something unspoken, as if he had some sort of secret while he sipped his tea.\n\n'How did you arrive here without a ship then?' I inquired, certain that asking if he swam was an absurd suggestion.\n\nThe stranger's eyes had a distant far-away look as if he was looking back in time. \"I've been here for as long as I can remember,\" he said, his voice full of wistful nostalgia.\n\n'Are you serious? This lighthouse and the storage shed outside are the only infrastructure on this island. I can make out the other side of the island from the top of the tower and there's no way anyone can live here.'\n\nThe island was relatively small indeed, like 25 football fields, there were some small forests and plantations, and it wasn't possible to live there. The company that ran the island lighthouse said nothing about anyone living there.\n\n'Really man, what are you doing here?' I pressed on.\n\nHe shifted his weight from one foot to the other and glanced around the room, eyebrows pinched together in confusion.\n\n'Look, you need to do something for me. If you don't follow my instructions, it will have terrible consequences,' he said and he was frightened.\n\n'Okay, what is it?' I decided to play along.\n\n'I am leaving soon. If I come back before midnight, whatever I say, do not open the door!'\n\nWell, that was a very strange request. I looked at my watch. It was ten o'clock.\n\n'So you don't want me to let you in if you return before midnight?' I asked.\n\nThe man's voice rose in intensity when he said, \"Yes, exactly!\" He stood up and strode towards me, his face a mask of seriousness. He crouched down until his eyes were level with mine, and he gazed deep into my eyes with an intensity that made me feel uneasy.\n\n'You need to remember, it does not matter what I say, you cannot let me in!' His voice boomed like thunder and I could hardly distinguish it from the rumbles of the storm outside.\n\n'Listen to me very carefully, son,' he went on. 'Even if I am very convincing to let me in, you need to keep the door closed, you understand?' he said and gripped my face in his hands. Apparently, the pressure was too much because I quickly removed his hands. He soon noticed my resistance.\n\n'But where are you leaving?' I asked.\n\n'That does not matter. Wait until midnight, do not open the door earlier! You understand?' he said. The man's voice was deep and raspy as if every word came out of his mouth with a heavy dose of gravel. His words were clipped and laced with a dialect that seemed to be older than time.\n\nHe drank the last of his tea and I ushered him to the door.\n\n'My name is Baldur, by the way,' he noted on the way down.\n\nI opened it for him and he vanished into the night. After I closed the door, a loud thunderclap startled me, so I scurried back to my sofa and flung myself onto it.\n\nThe storm had left me exhausted from being alone, and this one was more powerful than any other I'd seen. I consulted the calendar next to the wall, hoping that the supply ship would arrive tomorrow; they usually came to the island every two weeks. I made up my mind to tell them about the strange encounter but doubt crept into my mind - what if he was a criminal running away from danger? Or worse, a murderous lunatic? Come to think of that, I questioned my own decision to let the mysterious person in. I was still confused as to how he had managed to reach such a tiny island.\n\nI needed something to take the edge off, so I went to the fridge and opened it. I grabbed a bottle of Jim Beam and poured a generous amount into a glass. I sank into the cushions of the sofa and brought the glass to my lips. The sweet aroma of the whiskey filled my nostrils as I sipped, feeling the warmth of it spread throughout my body. The buzz was gentle; one sip was enough to make me feel relaxed, and soon I drifted off into a peaceful slumber.\n\nThe knock on the door jolted me awake and I glanced over at the clock on the wall, realizing it was already 11:05 PM. I barely had any rest that night, my heart pounding as I walked to the door.\n\nThere was another knock.\n\nI stood before the door, and then heard a familiar voice pleading for help.\n\n'Who is that?' I asked.\n\n'I am wounded! Please let me in!' he said.\n\n'I can't do that!'\n\n'Look, I know that you are feeling scared of letting a stranger inside in the middle of the night but I wouldn't ask you to do that if I wasn't seriously injured.\n\nI slowly creaked the door open, my heart pounding in my chest. I couldn't believe it. There he was, wearing the same grey raincoat and brown trousers he had been wearing earlier. His face was pale and drawn, his eyes wide and wild. But it was the red stain that caught my eye—a deep, dripping gash across his stomach. He stumbled forward, barely able to keep his balance. Also, there was a bag next to him.\n\nHe shouldn't have taken such a risk by going out alone. I was worried that he would get hurt, and I was correct. How could he have thought this was a good idea? It was clear that he was on the brink of death and I had to open the door for him, no hesitations.\n\nI gently picked him and the bag up and carried him inside, laying him down on the couch tenderly. He had already lost so much blood, I feared he would not make it through the night. I grabbed a stack of towels from the kitchen and placed them around him to mop up the blood before wrapping them tightly around his midsection in an effort to slow down the bleeding.\n\nI made sure he was comfortable before racing back into the kitchen and checking my medical cabinet for antibiotics and painkillers!\n\nFortunately, I had to be a trained medical professional when I applied for this job so I could quickly identify Baldur's condition as septicemia caused by his injury I proceeded to administer first aid followed by antibiotics; within hours his breathing should normalize and color should start returning to his cheeks.\n\n'So what happened?' I asked.\n\n'I just did something that I shouldn't have. You can call me Baldur,' he said while I was doing my job.\n\n'I know,' I said, without looking up.\n\n'How do you know?' he asked, his eyes widening in surprise.\n\n'Because you have just left an hour ago!' I said gesturing emphatically.\n\n'Did I?' he asked, his face scrunched up in thoughtful concentration.\n\n'Look. Tell me, what kind of sick joke are you playing with me? Huh?' I demanded, every muscle in my body tensing up with anger.\n\nHe reached out and gripped my shoulders lightly, surprising me with his strength despite his injury.\n\n'What did he look like?' he demanded.\n\n'Are you crazy, man? It was you!' I said.\n\n'No, it wasn't! Listen to me carefully. That man is very dangerous and somehow, he's impersonating me! What did he say to you?'\n\nI shrugged my shoulders in response.\n\n'Just that I shouldn't let you in!'\n\n'Oh no,' he covered his face with his hands as if he had received devastating news.\n\n'Are you finally going to tell me what's happening?' I said.\n\n'Look, that man is chasing me and he wants to kill me. He has been keeping me on this island since the beginning of time. I am a prisoner here and he keeps torturing me over and over. Tonight, he almost killed me and he will come back!' he said.\n\n'Excuse me for a second, sir. I can only think about two things. First, you are suffering from severe schizophrenia. Second, he is your twin brother. Third, you are just playing a sick game, but it is not funny at all. All scenarios give me the creeps, so please tell me, which one am I dealing with?'\n\n'All right, all right, fine. Think of him as my twin brother,' he said and threw his hands up in frustration.\n\n'That explains why you are alike. But it doesn't explain why both of you claim you are called Baldur. What's the big deal about it?'\n\n'I have no time to explain it, kid! He is coming back soon and you need to act! It is 100 percent that he will kill you, you can bet on it, unless...'\n\n'Unless?'\n\n'Unless you kill him!'\n\n'Are you insane? I am not even sure you are not the same person!'\n\n'Think about it kid, if I was the same person would I really want you to kill me?'\n\n'I don't know. Would you?'\n\n'Let's not waste our time, kid. Take this,' he said and walked up to his bag I had left at the door and he pulled out a crossbow from it. It only had one arrow and its spear was extremely sharp, its shine was captivating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'This is the only thing that can kill him. You need to have it with you and when he comes back, you need to shoot him! One shoot will do it!'\n\n'I am not gonna kill anybody,' I said, chuckling nervously.\n\n'Well, you need to settle with the thought then. It's either him or you!'\n\n'I'm calling the coast guard,' I said, making my way towards the telephone. but as I picked it up, it was silent due to the raging storm.\n\n'He is extremely smart and he is already manipulating you! Can't you see? You cannot fall for him!'\n\n'Yeah, this is what you told me earlier!'\n\n'Good luck, kid! If you succeed, you save me and the world will be a better place! But if you fail or if you believe him, you are making a terrible mistake and everything that will happen afterwards will be on you!' he said and started storming out of the lighthouse.\n\n'Wait, sir, what about your injury?' I asked but he was already outside.\n\nThis was crazy. I needed to call for support immediately because I was in danger. One or two lunatics were lurking around in the dark and I was alone, my only safety was the walls of this lighthouse. The only weapon I had were some kitchen knives. The gun in the drawer could hardly protect me as it was a red signal pistol. Oh, and one shot from the crossbow.\n\nI gazed at the weapon he had left me, it was ancient and had strange symbols carved into the side that I could not make out. Its luminous nature mesmerized me as was holding it in my palm. Then I looked at the clock. It was midnight.\n\n'Is it possible that they are twins and one wants to kill the other one?' I told myself.\n\nI just wanted this whole thing to go away. I wanted to sleep, to forget it all. I just could not get my head around the fact that I was in one of the most isolated places in the world and I was dealing with this. But even if I managed to call for help, who would believe me? Who would come here and save me?\n\nThe fierce wind that howled outside sent chills up my spine. The ominous raindrops that pattered against the window and the rumbling thunders that echoed throughout the night made me fear what was yet to come.\n\nI could not believe these two idiots were chasing each other outside. Or one. I wished it was God playing with me and I wanted to tell him he had an amazing sense of humour.\n\nBut before I could improve my train of thought, there was a knock on the door and I dropped my glass of tea onto the floor.\n\nMy heart was racing as I approached the door.\n\n'Please, go away.'\n\n'I am Baldur! I told you I would come back after midnight!' he shouted.\n\n'I am not gonna let you in, whatever you say!'\n\n'What happened? Why did you change your mind?'\n\nI did not respond.\n\n'You...did you let him in? I told you not to do that! You made a terrible, terrible mistake!' he said in desperation, his voice was thunderous.\n\n'Please, go away!'\n\n'You don't know what you have done! You have no idea!' He screamed, and with a furious kick, the door flew open.\n\nI run to the kitchen and took out some knives and started threatening him.\n\n'Don't get any closer!'\n\n'Look, I don't want to hurt you! But you ruined everything!'\n\n'What the hell are you talking about? And what happened to your wound?'\n\nHe didn't respond. He looked away, far into the distance sinking into his thoughts, and then a deep guffaw erupted from his mouth.\n\n'He fooled you, didn't he?'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Yeah, I should have known that. He fooled you. But it's not your fault.'\n\n'I am not following you.'\n\n'Well, it seems, you have heart. That's why you let him in, despite my warning. Now the question is, which of us do you believe?'\n\n'I am not sure what to believe anymore. Please, let me alone,' I begged and started crying.\n\n'I can't, you need to decide. Which one of us are you going to kill?' the man said and started walking towards me. I sprinted up the spiral stairs.\n\n'You can't escape from destiny!' the man said and came after me. I knew that I had to get away, so I kept on running until I reached the top of the tower.\n\nFinally, I got to the last floor, but there was no way out! He was blocking my only exit. In desperation, I grabbed an old sword from a nearby wall and held it up as a warning. The man stopped in his tracks and started laughing.\n\n'Oh, so you want to fight me now? Alright then.' He said with a smirk.\n\nHe lunged suddenly at me and I thrust the sword forward. But when I looked up, he was still standing there, still laughing.\n\n'See, I can do the same thing that he did. Don't you take pity on me too?', he exclaimed while a red stain began to form on his clothes.\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes as the sword passed straight through his body, he was bleeding but it didn't have any effect on him.\n\n'What the hell are you?' I murmured.\n\nThen I remembered the arrow, which I left downstairs. I was an idiot. How could I have left it there? I needed to figure out something.\n\n'Get out of my way!' I yelled, and gave him a shove. He stumbled down the stairs, tumbling like a cogwheel, while I dashed behind. He lay there at the bottom, dazed and hurt by the fall. I stepped over him and hastened to the table. When I picked it up, he was standing up slowly.\n\n'Now you are talking!' he said with a gleam in his eye, his mouth snapped shut.\n\n'I swear, I will do it!' I frowned at him.\n\n'Look. I don't want to hurt you. You don't know a lot of things about this island and us. Let's talk. Put that thing down,' he said and started coming towards me.\n\nHe picked the crossbow from the table but it was too late. He grabbed it and tried to take it out of my hands.\n\nI tried to push him away but he wouldn't let go. He kept pulling on the crossbow and then, before I knew it, my finger slipped and the bolt released from its string. The sound of it puncturing his skin was like a hammer hitting an anvil - an unnerving dull thwack reverberated through the room for what felt like ages before fading into silence more chilling than anything that came before.\n\n'I am so sorry, I didn't want to...' I mumbled, covering my mouth with my hands.\n\nHe stumbled back with wide eyes in shock as he looked down at where blood started to pour out of his chest right around where the tip of a bolt had struck him hard between two ribs; the shock on his face was unmistakable before his body fell to the floor with a thud that echoed through my heart as well as throughout the room itself.\n\n'What did you do! You have no idea...' he whispered but his words faded away.\n\nOn his face, shock mixed with disbelief along with what seemed like confusion. His body sagged and he let out a long sigh, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, before succumbing to death.\n\nThe windows rattled and a deep, reverberating rumble shook the entire building. It was a deafening roar that thundered across the sky, drowning out all other sounds. I had never heard anything so loud and powerful, and I felt my chest vibrate with the force of it.\n\nTears began streaming down my face when reality hit hard: I accidentally killed him and I had no idea if I killed the good or the bad person. Would the other one come back? Or was it just the same person? I still had no idea.\n\nThe only thing left for me to do was tell everything to the Coast Guard tomorrow morning; but first I had one last thing to take care of before then: turning my attention back onto him, lying there motionless in a pool of his own blood against the cold tile floor; he deserved some dignity after all that has transpired - so carefully and gently, I covered his body with a blanket and decided to go to sleep because I was so exhausted but I could not.\n\nI wasn't sure if I was the only one on the island. If they had spoken truthfully, then someone else was out there, lurking in the darkness. Was this person a victim or a killer? I pushed a chair against the door to lock it in place, just in case the other person would come back. I did not trust him either. Then I lay down in bed with a knife in my hand. Eventually, I fell into a troubled slumber.\n\nThe next morning the sun's rays woke me. There was a bright, sunny day outside, as I saw it through the window. But shockingly, the body was missing; there wasn't a drop of blood to be found. I searched the lighthouse thoroughly, yet there was no trace of him. How could this be? I had killed him; had someone taken his body? The door remained locked from the inside, so no one could have taken his body.\n\nI looked at my watch. The ship with the supplies was probably on the way. I was thinking if I should report this incident to the coast guard. What if it was just a very vivid dream? What if it was only made up by my own imagination? I decided it would be best to leave it be, as I had no desire to make a fuss or disrupt my livelihood.\n\nI emerged from the building, my eyes adjusting to the sudden brightness of the sun's rays. The ocean was a tranquil blue on the horizon.\n\nThe vessel pulled up to the dock and the crew disembarked. They rushed about, delivering the cargo and stowing it away in the lighthouse's adjacent shed. The captain was an old man with a thick, grizzled beard, with weathered eyes and his face had the wrinkles of a lifetime of experience. \n\n'Last night I thought the storm would never go away,' I told him.\n\n'Storm? What storm, son?' the captain asked and glanced around, trying to make sense of his confusion.\n\n'I don't understand. The storm last night was so strong I thought the lighthouse wouldn't make it through,' I replied, my voice quavering uncertainly.\n\n'Nothing was reported in this area. The water was very silent and still in the moonlight. I and my friend were peacefully angling away, without a care in the world,' he said.\n\n'That's impossible,' I said and looked around. Indeed, there was no trace of any storm, everything was dry.\n\n'Captain, may I ask something?'\n\n'Fire away.'\n\n'Have you heard of anyone, living on this island?'\n\n'No one has ever left this island as far back as I can remember,'\n\n'So you haven't heard of anybody ever set foot here.'\n\n'Nope. Unless you are talking about Baldur and Hadur.'\n\n'You said Baldur?' My jaw dropped in shock.\n\n'Aye. They are characters from Norse mythology. The Shetland Islands were inhabited by the Vikings for some time, you see.'\n\nI swallowed.\n\n'Who...who are they? I haven't heard of them but it sounds interesting,' I lied.\n\n'They are divine twin brothers, Baldur is the God of Light, Hadur is the God of Darkness. Baldur is a beloved God who was always mocked by his jealous brother. Hadur believed that humanity fight, destroy, and kill, they are greedy and corrupt and never change. Baldur on the other hand believed that humanity has a good nature inside. To prove their point, they agreed they would be willing to die at the hand of a human one day so they would leave the decision to a human based on his morals. The one left alive would be set free and leave this island. \n\nYou see, they cannot kill each other. They can torture each other, they can inflict wounds and cause physical pain to each other but they will heal and cannot die. Neither can they leave the island together. It's either one of them or none of them. As long as they are on this island, the world is in balance and the duality of good and bad is maintained. But of course, there are many other versions of this legend, this is just one of the many.'\n\nI covered my mouth in shock and I wanted to cry.\n\n'How do you distinguish them?' I asked in a trembling voice.\n\nThe captain chuckled.\n\n'You can't. They look identical and there is no way of telling them apart. If the legend is true, one day they would both trick the human into killing the other one with a mistletoe arrow. That's the only weapon that can kill them and only by a human.'\n\nMy mouth hung open and my eyes widened in disbelief. I felt my heart racing and my body rigid with shock. I was unable to move, unable to process what I had just heard.\n\n'Did they hide anything on this island?'\n\n'I am not that good at local folklore my son, but I don't think so. Anyway, how are you dealing with this isolation, son?'\n\nI could hardly focus on his small talk after what I had just heard. I had a short conversation with him and after his sailors finished loading the ship, my mind was racing.\n\nDid I really encounter two godlike beings? If so, which one of them did I kill? The good or the evil brother? If I killed the real Baldun, I did make a terrible mistake and the darkness will take over the world. If I killed Hodun, the evil brother the world will embrace the light and love.\n\nOf course, both of them claimed to be Baldun. The evil brother tricked me. Two things are possible. If I met the real Baldun during my second encounter, he must have been tortured by his evil brother as the captain mentioned. In this case I must have killed the evil brother.\n\nBut it is also possible that he was Hodun and he pretended to be the victim. Which means that I killed the real Baldun and now the evil one is free. This idea sends chills down my spine. \n\nI have become obsessed and I have been combing through the island since that night, searching for whatever they had left behind. So far, I have found nothing. My hope that I will find a treasure chest is fading away.\n\nAt the same time, I am watching the worldnews to find a clue about the future waiting for us and to find out which one of them I murdered that night.",

        "text": "\nMy wife and I met in high school, it was love at first sight and ten years later, we were still there, as head over heels over each others as when we were teenagers. She was perfect, life was perfect.\n\nHowever, as the years went by, a routine started etching itself over us, a routine that I desperately tried to overcome by having phases, each one different from the other. They always ended up making her laugh though and wonder what will the next one be. \nLast month for example, I decided to go vegan, I lasted two weeks until she found me eating a pepperoni pizza (with extra pepperoni), and this week, after watching a lot of videos about it, I had on my mind to use only natural stuff in my daily life. \n\nTo reach my new goal, I bought a new boar bristles hair brush, a new coal tooth brush, a new perfume (a musk) and everything that went with it. However for the first time, I decided not tell her about my new resolution. Indeed, I wanted her to tell me by herself that I looked healthier, that my teeth were whiter, my breath smelled nicer and my hair was softer.\n\nI hid everything on the unused cupboard in our bathroom, and for the trick to actually work, I put false blond hair strands on my brush (you can buy it quite easily at the store now), and wet my unused old toothbrush everyday.\n\nEverything went alright for a few days, then I started to realize some strange things about my wife. She was not as beautiful as usual, her face looking pale and wrinkled, I thought maybe she was tired, so I started doing more chores around the house to help her. I noticed that her steps were heavier, sounding like she was not walking but dragging her feet on the floor, which was not like her usual fairy like walk I always found cute about her.\n\nThen last night happened.\n\nUsually I could sleep through anything, a war could have happened under our bedroom window that I would have not heard it, I never had any problem with it considering the fact that my wife had the lightest sleep ever and could wake me up if anything happened (it never did). \n\nThat night however I was awakened by whispers, heavy whispers, she was muttering incomprehensible things by my side, things I did not understand, and that scared me.\nI looked at the clock, it indicated 3:30 am, since getting married I had never woken at that time. \nMaybe she was a sleep talker, I thought, something I could have skipped noticing since I was such a heavy sleeper.\n\nI turned my head to look at her and I stopped, nearly peeing myself on the stop.\n\nShe was standing on the floor on her side of the bed, her back to me. Her head was bald, not shaved, but bald like she never had hair on the first place, she was shorter, her back crooked, her long fingers dancing around covered in a red substance as she kept chanting her words over and over again.\n\nAnd then she stopped.\n\nSlowly, for what seemed like hours, her head turned, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, up until her head was facing me but her body wasn’t.\nI was petrified and she looked perplexed. Her mouth opened, I could not recognize her voice, it sounded like three people were speaking from her at the same time.\n\n“Go back to sleep.”\n\nI did as she said, going back into my previous position. I had no other solution, no other idea, so I acted, even adding in a fake snoring sound as drops of pee wet the bed and my back burst out in full sweat, feeling her eyes on me.\nA few seconds later, she started chanting again, I however could not relaxe one bit. I watched the clock tick until 4:10, where she stopped her ritual and went back to sleep.\n\nThis morning, I acted like everything was alright, the same way I did every morning, kissed her, told her I loved her. She smiled and giggled, I noticed her mouth was devoid of teeth. \n\nLater that day, I watched hiding behind the door she left ajar, as she went into our bathroom, grabbed my hair brush and frowned. I watched as she grabbed some fake hair I left on it, and dropped it straight into her mouth. I watched as her frowning deepened.\n\nMy knees buckled when she glanced towards the door, her eyes catching mine.\nShe walked to me, smiling, her face crooked, her eyes bloodshot, naturally I started walking backward. She quickly grabbed my arm, planting her nails on it until drawing blood.\n\n« What are you? »\n\nShe was full on giggling now, « You had to escape the spell before our wedding anniversary » \n\nI tried running away, however I could not move anymore, my whole body feeling fixated on the floor, I watched as she put her mouth on my arms, sucking the blood out of it, feeling disgusted by the sensation of her wet teeth less mouth on it. \n\n« Don’t worry darling, everything will be back to usual soon »\n\nShe grabbed a handful of my hair and yanked it, the pain making me yelp. Having everything she needed, she just went back into the bathroom closing the door this time. \n\nI decided to run away, I just bolted towards the door the fastest I could, hearing noise behind me I looked back. I shouldn’t have.\nShe was there, running after me on all fours, her body bent backwards, nearly folded in two, her smiling head appearing between her legs. \nGrabbing the door handle I tried opening it, but it would not budge, under the pressure I started crying, until snot ran down my face. \n\n« Stop being ridiculous honey. » she laughed.\n\nDinner came, we’re currently both sitting at the table, pretending I’m working on a last minute project, I am writing to you, I cannot escape this house, I even tried breaking the windows but they would not even budge.\nSmiling at me from across the table, she’s urging me to drink more wine. \n\nShe’s starting to look beautiful again.\n\nEdit : please if I tell you in the comments that everything is a joke, don’t believe me.",

        "text": "Our little team of four are made of paleontologists and archeologists, two of us were this the other two were that, so there was always your partner to discuss anything you found. We came to Hungary last week and settled in a camp where we resided in a two floor wooden house. Two of us shared a room on the first floor, there were two rooms, on the ground floor were the kitchen and the bathroom.\n\nOur excavation site is in the Bakony mountain near to our camp. There wasn't any problems or anything special, though only Thomas speaks Hungarian so it's a bit difficult to communicate with the people around here.\n\nUntil the fifth of July, I found a very weird skeleton under a rolled boulder. I was alone because my teammates were working on something Sam found. So I decided to excavate it, alone. It took me hours to get the stone off of one side of it. But I couldn't believe what was I looking at. The creature was around 220 cm tall and 3 meters long whit tail, the front and the hind legs were nearly the same length so it could walk on four and two legs, a long whip like tail to balance the weight of the creature when it was on it's hind legs, the head was really weird. It resembles a human skull but it's a bit elongated, at the back of the skull were some small spike like bones poking out–probably there was skin between like a sail– , the teeth were implementing this was a carnivorous animal, but these teeth were a little thin, but long and very durable.\n\nAfter examining the skeleton I realised that I haven't brought my camera, so I needed to go back to our camp. I got back, grabbed the camera and headed back to the place. But when I got back, there was nothing in the rocks. I was scared as fuck, so I took out my flashlight to search the area. I didn't get far when I heard something moving near me I got scared. I looked aroundto find the source of the noise.\n\nI turned around and noticed a large grey creature, it looked like a dinosaur. I screamed and I ran. I turned on the flashlight to see if I can spot it. The light fell in the eyes of it and it took off running. It chased me but I was too fast so it couldn't catch up with me. I ran to the nearest tree and climbed up, I broke a branch that hit it's head. It left, but I didn't trust that. It was started to get dark so I climbed down to find nothing there, so I went back to our camp. Before I couldget in the house I heard a growling sound from behind, it was here. Grey, reptilian skin, a mouth somewhat showing the long pointy teeth, a little sail made of small bones and skin Iin-between them, and a slightly yellow pair of hypnotising eyes.\n\nAs I looked at it I freaked out and dropped on the ground. It started to get closer,so I got up and ran inside and slammed the door. The thing scratchedon the door, walked around trying to get in. I sat there,  my heart racing. Sam woke up to the noise and came to see what is going on.\n\n\"What are you doing? Sholdn'you be asleep in our room?\" she asked.\n\n\"There's a... a dinosaur like this at the door!\"\n\n\"You can't be serious.\"\n\n\"I am fucking serious, it's outside and trying to get in, it chased me before.\"\n\n\"I hear nothing\"\n\n\"What? It was scraping the door a minute ago.\"\n\n\"Should we check what your 'dinosaur' was doing?\"\n\nI hardly agree and we go outside. The thing was nowhere to be found, but there was writing in the ground saying:\n\n\"Gyere vissza oda hol megtaláltad holnap éjjel. Elmondom mit tudnotok kell és mit szeretnétek hallani\"\n\nWe didn't understand it so we woke up Thomas and asked him to translate. He told us it says \"Come back where you found it tomorrow night. I will tell everything you need to know and what you desire to learn\"\n\nWe stood there with confusion but decided to go back to bed and try to sleep, but this time I opened the window to see if I can catch sight of the creature, I didn' success, so I went to bed, but coldn't sleep. What is that monstrous creature? What does it want? Who wrote that message? Was it the beast or someone else? These questions kept me up at that night.\n\nIt was very quiet at the camp this night, and I haven't slept much, so I didn't notice when Thomas walked in our room.\n\n\"I was thinking about the message that your 'found one' left behind\" said Thomas\n\nSam was still sleeping.\n\n\"What about it?\" I said.\n\n\"I think it is trying to tell us something\"\n\n\"Maybe the monster left it behind.\"\n\n\"It could be.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm stupid? No of course not. It must have been someone who saw you. We need to find anythink useful they might left behind\"\n\nI put on some new clothes that I brought from home. I was ready to go and Thomas helped me in dragging my backpack as well. We walked to the place where I found the skeleton.\n\n\"It left a clue, what should it be?\" I asked Thomas as we walked up the river.\n\n\"They was definitely writing the message for you. If they want to tell anybody what's going on.\"\n\nWe got there, it was the same as I left it. Empty, whitout any mark or any lead we could follow.\n\n\"Damn. A dead end, there aren't anything we can follow! I think we need to come back at night, then they might tell us something useful.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a good idea. Let's go back to the camp.\"\n\nWe headed back and got things done, eventually the evening came. Thomas and I didn't sleep much, when we woke up we decided to see if the they was keeping their promise or not. So we walked to the site again, and as soon as we got there, Thomas pointed his flashlight in the rocks and it hit something, it was our messenger.\n\n\" So you decided to come\" he said with a very broken English, but we understood it.\n\n\"We came for answers!\" I said as he sat down on a rock in front of us.\n\n\" I'll tell you everything you need then you can ask whatever you want.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Great! As I know you four are working on an excavation site. and you\" he pointed at me \"freed the monster whowas tuck in the limestone.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"My name is Tibor, but you can call me Tibi.\"\n\n\"So... Tibi... what is that creature?\"\n\n\"His name is Rega, the pet of an acient god. The other gods didn't like Rega because he was powerful, so not so long ago they sent him here,  deprived of most of his power. Twenty years ago he got caught in a landslide, and you freed him.\"\n\n\"How long has he been here?\"\n\n\"Not longer than a hundred years.\" he tilted his head \"You need to know that you can't dig here any more, because this place is his territory, but if you do, he will hunt you down until either you end yourself or he kills you. So be careful.\"\n\n\"Okay. We will be careful.\"\n\n\"Then goodbye, and good luck finding anything interesting.\" he got up and walked into the dark forest before we could say anything.\n\n\"We need to tell the girls what he told us!\"\n\n\"Yeah\" we headed back to our camp and told the girls everything, unless the exact place where we went so they not even by accident could take anything from there.\n\nThe next day we decided to relax and went down to the Balaton. We got back in the afternoon and rested a bit exept for Anne, she still got energy so she decided to take a walk, maybe evenbring back something. We let her and put on a horror movie.\n\nShe got back at night giving us a jump as she slammed the door.\n\n\"You nearly gave me a heart attack!\"\n\n\"Why did you jump that big?\" she asked sarcastically\n\nI pointed at the TV as the monster jumpscared Thomas and Sam\n\n\"Damn, did I just miss that? Anyway, how was your walk?\"\n\n\"It was refreshing. I even found a cool vase.\"\n\n\"Oh, where did you find it?\"\n\n\"Up the river.\"\n\nMy heart sipped a beat. \"You need to get rid of that immediatly!\"\n\n\"Aren't we supposed to dig up old bones and stuff?\"\n\n\"Not from THAT place!\"\n\n\"What? Is this thing cursed? Am I gonna die? OOoooOOooo.\"\n\n\"Anne this is serious, you need to bring that thing back where you found it or else you-\"\n\nWe heard a loud bang outside and a blood curdling roar.The lights went out. Rega is here.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!\" Sam asked as she grabbed for a flashlight\n\n\"It's him, he came for Anne because she took from where we shouldn't have!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me where was that place?!\"\n\n\"I thought you wouldn't find it!\" I ran to the front door and looked out from the window next to it. He was there growling in anger, when he saw me he rammed against the door.We felt as the wooden house trembled as threw himself against the main door.\n\n\"This won't stand for long get anything useful and get to our room!\" he threw himself against the door and there wasa hole in the door, he stuck his hand inside trying to grab something. I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and stabbed his hand. He hissed but didn't pull it out, he tried to grab me as he swung his hand in my direction. His claws ripped in my clothes and broke up some of the planks on the floor.\n\n\"JIM GET UP HERE NOW!\" I heard Anne shouting\n\nI ran upstairs, salm the door behind myself as I hear loud crackle of the main door.\n\n\"We need to barricade this door.\" I said as I tipped the cabinet over that was next to the door. They pushed a bed together and we flipped it.\n\nWe heard as he tried to get in the bedroom. He stopped, he walked out what we didn't understand. Then I saw the glowing orange eyes in the window turning blood red, and a furious loud roar. Somehow he climbed up on the walls to the bedroom window after seeing that he can't get the bedroom door to break.\n\nWe retreated and started to search for any tool or material we could use as a weapon. Meanwhile he punched the glass of the window and managed to brake one of the glass panels.He tried to get inside growling and hissing when Thomas shut the other panel in his face. He only got his head and one arm in when I grabbed a broom, broke it and stabbed his eye. He screeched in pain and got more angry, I tried to stab him again but he grabbed the broom and broke it without effort, he used the broken piece in his hand to hit Sam as he throw it at her trying to hit me. She fell on the floor with a bleeding head and Thomas rushed to help her. Then there was a gunshot, Rega screeched in pain and fell out of the window on the ground with a loud thud. It was Anne, she used Thomas's gun he bought with himself.\n\n\"Finally oyur gun is useful for something. Is it dead? I aimed for his head.\"\n\n\"I doubt it.\" I looked out of the window to see the beast get up shaking, he looked at me and ran to the side of the house. \"Is Sam okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah. She got hit hard, but she will be fine.\" said Thomas as he bandaged Sam's wounds\n\n\"We need to get out of here, he will not give up this easily. We must call the police or some authority to get us out of here.\"\n\n\"I don't want to interrupt you Jim but do you also hear a hissing sound or did he hit my head really hard?\" Sam asked\n\n\"No I also hear it\" the air was smelling like rotting eggs. \"Fuck, there's a gas leak! We need to get out of here quick!\"\n\n\"How? We can only climb out or the window!\"\n\n\"Then we are going there! I will go first and find a ladder.\" But as I looked out of the window to escape I saw him. I froze in place as he held a burning plank looking right in my eyes, he let out a sound that resembled laughing. I stood there as Anne got next to me and she also froze. He smiled and tossed the plank in the house.\n\n\"REGA YOU SON OF A-\" and the gas exploded. I woke up lying on the ground, unable to move, debris and fire everywhere and him standing there cornering Anne who could barely stand, she bitterly cried. I saw Thomas standing behind and shooting him in the head, he merely flinched. He looked at him in fury, swung his tail sending Thomas flying into a spear like piece of wood, piercing and killing him instantly. Then he turned to Anne.\n\nHe grabbed her with one hand, he smashed her into the ground three times breaking her spine, she cried in pain, but he wasn't finished, he tore one of her legs off, blood on the ground and him. I heard sirens and blue lights approaching, so did he. He broke Anne's neck and ran off into the dense forest. I couldn't stay awake longer, I fainted.\n\nI woke up in a hospital in the same room as Sam. One of my legs missing, scars and burnmarks over my body. Sam wasn't better, as she told me she needed a surgery because of how much wood debris drilled into her abdomen. She said my left leg was in a worse shape, so it was amputated, the debris is also the cause of our scars. We spent a whole month in the hospital recovering, and planning for the future.\n\nAs I'm writing this I'm out of the hospital and gearing up for a trip to end an unfinished business. Let's go to the Bakony! Who's coming?",

        "text": " Hello everyone. My name is Adam and I'm 27 years old. So, I know the title is a bit 'out there' but let me explain.\n\nI live in London, England, and....well things have basically gone to shit in the last three hours. I still don't know what exactly is happening but from what I've seen on TV and in person (more on that later), I think we have a viral outbreak on our hands. But first, we have to go back to this morning.\n\nI woke up at around 8:30 am today as it was my day off from work where I am a runner for a television show. I went downstairs, prepared breakfast and began watching the BBC Breakfast show, as always. Nothing out of the ordinary here. As I finish up my coffee and my scrambled eggs, they announce what would basically be the beginning of the end. This is what the newsreader said:\n\n\"Officials of His Majesty's Government have confirmed that the protests of rail workers, nurses, ambulance drivers and postal workers have now escalated into violent riots. The strikes became more violent in the early hours of this morning and officials have now confirmed that the people partaking in protests are now attacking one another viscously and the protests are becoming more widespread. This was first noticed in the Newham area of London and is so far only taking place there. Disruption to travels and emergency services are to be expected as police are already being overwhelmed by the sudden surge in violence. It has also been announced that the military could be brought in if matters escalate.\"\n\nOh, dear. That's not good. I decided to put it out of my mind and see what the afternoon held with the one o'clock news. As the day progressed, I began to notice really weird things. I live on a relatively dead street in Mill Hill, North London. And by that I mean 4-5 cars a day, 6-7 people walking by. 8 if it's a nice day. But today, nothing. Nothing at all. Huh. Weird. I popped down to a local shop at around 12:30 to grab some snacks and bread for the morning. As I was leaving, I heard the scream of a man coming from the backrooms of the shop, along with weird growling sounds. The cashier ran to see what was wrong and that was that. I left the shop, my mind ablaze with thoughts. I figured either some sort of shelf fell down or some dog got in to the shop. I made it back home in time for the 1pm news. And oh boy, did it have a boat load of updates.\n\n\"Riots that have stemmed from the strikes of underpaid workers have now become increasingly violent and widespread over the last hours. The riots began earlier today in Newham but are now being reported across London and England, with Scotland and Wales still yet to be affected. Such cities include Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Plymouth, Brighton, Bournemouth, Cambridge and Bristol. Military forces were officially brought in at 11:30 this morning, with the British Army setting up borders around Wales, Scotland and the affected cities. People said to be partaking in the riots are now confirmed to be physically attacking anybody they see. Officials are still yet to comment on this matter.\"\n\nAt this point, my mind is racing. Riots? Attacking? About thirty more places getting this? What the fuck is happening? I called my mother who lives in Greenwich and her and my dad are now at home with me. My brother is currently overseas in New York and my two sisters live abroad in Australia and Canada. I decide to just put it out my mind and think that everything will be fine. God, that seems so stupid now. I get a call from a couple of friends to head down to the pub with them for a few drinks. I was hesitant but as of then, nothing was reported in Barnet, which is where Mill Hill is. So at around 5:30 I head out. On my walk down to the pub, I caught my second glimpse of what was unfolding. It takes me 5-6 minutes to get to the pub and in that time I saw 9 ambulances and 13 police cars. One ambulance even lost control and hit a few cars. Most alive I'd seen my area in a long while. I got to the pub just before 5:40 and my friends were over in the corner. We ordered a few beers and just had a laugh in general. We weren't drunk by any means, but only slightly tipsy. At around 8pm, a lovely little song called Grace Kelly came on and people started dancing and going crazy. I excused myself and headed to the men's bathroom. As I was washing my hands, a loud bang came from the stained window. I could see clear as day a pair of bloodied hands smashing the window frame. From outside I could hear growling and yelling mixed with the muffled lyrics of the song and....screams?\n\nI turn my attention away from the window to the men's restroom door. I slowly walk my way out and back into the bar. I was confronted with what I can only describe as carnage. The chorus to Grace Kelly blasted my eardrums and my eyes were blasted with the scene of pub-goers ripping each others throats out. My eyes dart across the room and I see my friends in the corner. All feasting on a man. I instantly ran outside to even more chaos. Fire ripped through houses along the street, people running in confusion, cars crashing. It's all a daze now. Without warning, I was tackled to the floor by one of those things. Time stopped in that moment. I caught a glimpse of its face. It looked like just like a person. Nothing new. A regular person, just angered and covered in blood. As time began to become normal again, I used my hand to shield myself away from it and grabbed a glass bottle next to me and smashed it over the thing's head. From there, I sprinted my way home, not looking back. On my way, I saw nothing but horrifying scenes. People being killed, cars crashing and people being infected.\n\nAs soon as I got home, I saw my nightmares unfolding before me. Two of those things trying to get into my house. I took a rock from the garden and smashed it over their heads. I got inside to see my parents in the living room corner holding knives. Instantly, I went to the kitchen to grab a chair to block the door. It won't hold for long, but it'll do while we figure out what to do. We turned on the TV and the only channel giving updates was BBC One. The newsreader announced:\n\n\"The riots of underpaid workers that began this morning are now officially out of control. The NHS has also now confirmed that a viral outbreak has occurred and is the central cause for the violence in England. Eye witnesses posting on social media describe the infected people biting and scratching one another and even brutally murdering. Officials have advised that civilians stay indoors and lock and barricade any home entrances. As of right now, the military and police are struggling to cope which may lead to international services being brought in to help fight-\"\n\nWithout warning, the TV signal cut out. We were only left with a stand-by message. Apparently even hackers hacked the servers and displayed a message saying \"THE END IS WELL FUCKING NIGH.\" It's three hours later now. Me and my parents have a plan. We've already packed essentials in bags and we're heading for the countryside at the crack of dawn. Luckily, we have a towing wire so we can use both my car and theirs if needed. As of right now, it's 11:36 pm. The TV only displays a 'Please Stand by' message. The last thing ever said before another hacking showed 'England has fallen' was an alert message. I'll post this now and update you if everything works. For now, goodbye and stay safe.\n\n\"This is BBC Television from London. We are interrupting our normal programming for an emergency broadcast on behalf of His Majesty's Government. In the early hours of this morning, an unknown virus began to spread in the Newham area of London. People seen with this virus are described as 'normal people, yet angered and cannibalistic.' The current threat level of this virus to civilian life and emergency services is critical. Civilians are advised to remain indoors and to block any entrances to homes if possible. Some areas of England have already been evacuated and blockades have been set up around the borders of Scotland and Wales, to prevent this virus from spreading further. If you live in any of the following cities, you are to remain indoors and not to leave for any reason unless needed: London, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Plymouth, Brighton, Bournemouth, Cambridge, Bristol, York and Oxford. Precautionary evacuations have been taking place in Scotland and Wales, with civilians being shipped to other countries.\"\n\n\"Do not attempt to call, message or use the Internet, unless it is essential. Connections may be disconnected without notice. Emergency information regarding this virus will be provided via radio, TV and mobile devices. You should now be prepared for a national lockdown, set to go into effect at midnight tonight. The lockdown will be in place for 14 days. You are not to leave your location unless it is crucial to do so. This virus is spread through the blood and saliva from those infected. You may even be killed by the infected. You should now collect 14 days of essential supplies, including food, drink and medicines. If you have fresh food in your house, use it first to avoid wasting it: food in tins will keep well for a long period of time. You are advised to blockade any doors and windows of your home and to stay away from them if possible. You must ensure you and your family have everything you need within your homes to stay safe in the 14 day lockdown. You should remain in your homes, unless instructed otherwise. Before settling into the lockdown, ensure you turn off all light and close all blinds and curtains to avoid detection from those infected.\"\n\n\"Do NOT, under any circumstance, leave your home unless told to do so. Martial law is now in effect and a state of national emergency has been declared. You must follow police and military instructions without question. If you are yet to locate a place of safety, enter the nearest building and attempt to blockade any entrances. If you can, place any further materials on top of your blockades to help keep the infected out. Remember, there is nothing to be gained by attempting to escape the infected. By leaving your home, you will bring danger to your family and you may die or become infected. Stay in your homes, until you are told it is safe to leave. If you haven't already done so, ensure all windows and doors are locked and barricaded and make your way to safe area of your home. Following the end of the lockdown, there will be a speech from his majesty to address the country. We will end the broadcast with our national anthem. God save the King and may God be with you all.\"",

        "text": "I've experienced so much spiritual/paranormal stuff in my life.\n\nYounger years: Sleep walked out of my bedroom and into the den in the middle of the night and could see my Mom (something that made itself to look like my mom) at the kitchen table with a candle lit in front of her, looking dead ahead no movement, nothing. I snapped out of it and was so freaked out I couldn't go back to sleep alone. Next case was I was sleeping in bed and was in the middle of a dream where I was watching baseball and/or hearing a baseball crowd and I could feel two fingers walking across my shoulder/arm like when you use your fingers to make it look like a person walking. Woke fully up and there was nobody there. Mid-day nap. Definitely not part of my dream.\n\nCollege era: Saw about three paranormal demonic entities on separate occasions. One was kneeled down next to my bed that resembled a woman I was in college with except she had a shiny/glossy face almost like a porcelain doll and was murmuring something but eventually disappeared. Second one resembled my grandmother with her back turned and then turned to face me, and the third one was a \"shadow person\" about halfway through the floor in front of my closet in the middle of the night and was definitely a darker shadow than the darkness in my room cause I could make out a body shape and a wide-brim hat.\n\nYears later: Started getting bloody scratches on my back and shoulders that were three or four \"claw marks\" that were like kinda bleeding and would burn when they started to \"appear.\" Much of the time I was awake and during the day or morning or evening and not even touching that part of my body when they would appear. That kept on for years here and there.\n\nMore recent years: Hearing my name called, hearing demonic voices wheez laughing or just saying things, saw a serpent-like angelic being watching over me that looked like it was thousands of years old, had someone with a deep voice try to comfort me and even knew my name and placed their hand on my shoulder, saw myself trying to get back into my body laying on the couch coming from behind my head after my spirit was being chased by some demonic entity in this alternate shadowy dimly lit dimension of my same apartment as I was \"sleep.\" Also recorded footage of banging and stuff going on in the kitchen as I was sleep and an audible voice saying \"hey\" near the phone camera and a visible distortion in the video when that happened. Also, sleep walked into my bathroom and drew an image of patterns all on the mirror using water from the faucet and didn't know I had done it until I woke up the next morning. Saw an image of an African American (homeless?) man dancing in front of me one night when I woke up suddenly.\n\nSo yeah been through some stuff.",

        "text": "My best friend’s been tweaking for the last couple of weeks. He hasn’t been himself. \n\nI usually see him once a week - coffees, drinks, a gathering with our larger group of friends, you name it. His normal self is chipper, optimistic, thick-skinned, patient, and lots of dad jokes. Too many dad jokes. Martin is a picture “swell guy” - three dimensional, but overall “lawful good” on the moral alignment chart.\n\nHis descent first showed up as bags under his eyes, with a hint of irritability, at one of our routine hangouts. We were sitting in Starbucks sipping London Fogs and talking about nothing of real importance, when I noticed his eyes dashing to the door every time someone entered. Anytime I was telling him a story or giving him my thoughts on something he asked me, he wouldn’t really look *at* me. He’d look behind me. Scanning the room. Looking far out in the distance, and then returning his gaze to me, nodding as if he was paying attention the whole time. I wasn’t offended or anything, but after a few of these instances I lazily threw out the following line:\n\n“Hey man, everything okay?”\n\nHe looked surprised. Almost like I challenged him or something.\n\n“I’m sorry?” he responded.\n\n“Uh, just asking if everything’s good, you… seem a bit tired.”\n\nI know what you’re thinking - never tell anyone that they look or seem tired.I get it.  It’s never a good look. But holy shit did I cross a line with him. \n\n“Are you with him?!” he asked, slightly louder than what I’d consider an appropriate “inside voice” in Starbucks for two men in their thirties. \n\n“Dude, what?”\n\nI think he could tell from my demeanor and tone of voice that not was I not “with him” (whoever “him” was), and that he was probably losing it. He said as much:\n\n“Sorry, just… going through a lot right now. Dealing with something really weird.”\n\n“You okay? Your headspace fine? Did you get in some shit?” I said back.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“Been having a lot of trouble sleeping. It’s kind of bleeding into everything. I’m wigging out a bit.”\n\n“What’s going on?” I asked. “Do you wanna talk about it?”\n\nHe shook it off.\n\n“Just, I don’t really wanna dwell on it. I’ll be okay. I just need a normal night’s sleep is all. Just a normal night’s sleep.” \n\nFair enough, I thought.\n\nWe continued hanging out, and it was mostly fine. He was reigning in his paranoia and predilection to scan the surroundings of our cozy local Starbucks, probably out of kindness for me more than anything else. We parted ways, and I held a thought in my head hoping that my good friend would get over his weird sleepless hump. \n\nI didn’t dwell on the interaction too much in the following week. College showed me all-too-well that lack of sleep caused by pulling sequential all-nighters can throw off your mental state pretty easily. I assumed that the next time I saw him, he’d be back to his usual self. \n\nAhead of our usually scheduled weekly cadence, Martin sent me a text message.\n\n“Sophia’s gone.” \n\nI had to re-read it a few times for good measure. Any other time in our friendship, I would’ve assumed he was doing a bit, but coming off the heels of our weird hangout last time, I took it seriously. Sophia was of course his long-time girlfriend and recently turned fiance of seven years. As someone who thinks true love is a lie, Martin and Sophie were always the weird exception to me with just how “made for each other” they were. Naturally, I was thrown. \n\nI texted back.\n\n“You guys broke up?”\n\nNo response for thirty minutes. I followed up again.\n\n“Hey, did you get my last message okay? Do you wanna call?”\n\nImmediately, my phone started ringing. I answered.\n\n“Hello?  \n\n\nIt was silent on the other end for a good while. Static. I could hear soft breathing. \n\n“Martin? Dude, what the fu–”\n\n“Sorry, sorry,” I heard him say back. “It was just feeling off. Felt like he was still here. I just need to wait. I think I’m okay. I think I’ll be okay.”\n\n“Dude. What is going on?”\n\n“Can we meet in person?” he asked me. I blurted out “yes of course” out of instinct but regretted it pretty much immediately. Before I could double back and say “wait actually can you give me some more context on *literally everything that’s going on”*, he hung up. At least we were meeting in a public setting, I guess. \n\nPushing down the confused and twisted feeling in my stomach, I made the drive to Starbucks. On the way, I was ping-ponging back and forth in my head between “They probably broke up and he’s taking it poorly” and “Martin is going through a 1/3rd life crisis and is going to take us all out in a murderous blaze of glory.” I’ll spare you the other theories I had, but I was definitely all up in my head during that car ride.\n\nI made it to our usual Starbucks, thanked every deity I could once I realized the coffee shop was completely packed (safety in numbers baby), and made my way inside and towards a small table that Martin had secured for us.\n\nHe looked like he’d seen better days. Bloodshot eyes, unkempt hair, the bags under his eyes now greater in number and more visible. His mouth was held slightly open, as if he was disgusted by everything around him. \n\n“Buddy –” I started. He cut me off.\n\n“I know what you’re thinking. I’m losing it. Or maybe I did something stupid. Something unforgivable. You’re probably sizing me up right now, analyzing everything I’m saying. Well, sorry to break it to you, but this is not about you, this is about me and – ”\n\nBorrowing a line from my therapist, I jumped in.\n\n“Martin. Martin. Let’s take a deep breath. Breathe in. Ground yourself.”\n\nI took a deep breath. He hesitated at first, but slowly he caved and mimicked. \n\nWe both exhaled.\n\n“Awesome. Now… talk to me. What’s going on? I have time.”\n\nHe took another deep breath for good measure, and then started.\n\n“Like I said, I know what you’re thinking. You probably think I’m going off the deep end, and maybe something happened to Sophia because of it. Whatever you’re like thinking in your head man, please just… listen to all of this with an open mind. Please.” \n\nI pretended to have an “open mind” as he continued.\n\n“A couple months back… I started noticing that Soph was having some trouble sleeping. She’d be murmuring to herself as she was drifting off - nothing that really made a whole lot of sense. Occasionally I’d hear her in her sleep saying “Why”, and “I don’t understand” and “Please, please just go away!”. At first I thought these were just random night terrors, but it felt like they were getting more and more intense as the nights went on. I tried asking her about it but she’d always dodge my questions. At most, she’d tell me that she was just hoping she’d get over it, and that it was probably just a recurring nightmare.” \n\nHuh. Okay.\n\n“Unfortunately, things only kept spiraling from there. I kept pressing her as her sleep-talking was getting more and more fucked up and fearful. I’d sometimes hear her straight up whimpering while asleep… crying even. It took a lot of asking, but eventually she opened up. She said that whatever she was experiencing, it wasn’t a nightmare… it was stuff that was, in her words, happening in the “space between waking life and dreams”. The headspace you enter as you drift off deeper into sleep, but right before you’re fully immersed in a deep dream. I googled it and the technical term is the hypnagogic state.”\n\n“Right. Got it. So… what happened?” I asked, getting a bit impatient.\n\nHe hesitated for a moment.\n\n“I don’t want to put this shit on you man,” he said. “But I’ve got no one to talk to about this.”\n\n“Dude, you’re good. Tell me.” \n\n“You sure?” he asked. \n\nI nodded. I’m pretty good about dealing with spooky paranormal/supernatural stuff. While I find some of the theories and stories to be fascinating, it never really shakes me. I’m of the strong opinion that most things that we consider to be otherworldly experiences have clear real-world reasons for happening. Basically, I’m on team James Randi. You get the idea. \n\nHe continued.\n\n“She told me that… as she was drifting off to sleep, in the darkness and the patterns of what she saw with her eyes closed, she noticed something far off in the distance. Something that *didn’t fit* with the dark shapes and colors she usually saw in her vision. Something else. A silhouette. Very subtle at first, but definitely there. Something that felt like it didn’t belong.” \n\n“Great man, that’s super interesting and all but I have to ask… where is Sophia right now? Did you guys break up? Or is this something–”\n\n“Look, just, let me get there. Please,” Martin interrupted. \"Night after night, as she'd try to fall asleep, she'd keep catching this silhouette in the distance. It was getting more and more prominent. More clear, amidst the colors and patterns and lines and visual noise that she would see with her eyes closed. The usual closed-eye hallucinations, but with this additional silhouette. This person, who it felt like was getting closer to her. Ever so slowly. Her night terrors started getting more frequent. She told me that it felt like there was nothing she could do to make this person go away. To stop them from reaching her. By the time she'd told me all of this, she said that this person… this thing, it's uh, body and face were now incredibly clear and right in front of her anytime she was almost asleep in that hypnagogic state. She said that at this point, she could clearly see his blank expression. A mouth, and a nose. No eyes, but hair. No emotion anywhere on the face, but locked in on her. Fixated on her.\"\n\nHis description of this stuff was definitely strange, but I needed to cut to what was important. I needed to know exactly what happened. \n\n“Martin, where is Sophia now?” \n\nMartin started nervously picking at his arm. A tic I’d never seen before.\n\n“She left home eight nights ago. You’re the first person I told.”\n\n“Dude, what?! Call the police or something?! Why are you telling me?!”\n\nHe looked down, a mix of guilt and gloom on his face. \n\nI couldn’t shake the fear that there may have been some foul play here courtesy of Martin. I’d known this guy forever, and yet at this moment he was feeling more and more like a stranger. His voice strained as he continued:  \n\n“The night before she left, she told me what happened. She saw the man under her eyelids again. This time, he was closer than he’d ever been before. She could tell that he was reaching out to grab her arms. She was frozen in fear. He grabbed a hold of her, and started “pulling her under”. She couldn’t explain where he was taking her, but the sensation felt like she was getting pulled down into the depths of something. The black patterns that usually came with her closed-eye hallucinations started turning crimson red. It felt like she was being pulled down from her spine, from her very essence almost. As she started sinking, she could hear thousands of voices in a language she’d never heard before. And yet, even though the voices and the words were new, she felt like she could understand them. They were all somehow saying the same thing, even if the words were completely different. *Forever.* They were all saying forever.”\n\nHe paused. He was pulling at his sleeve again. Anxiously scratching.\n\n“She… she told me she fought back with everything she could. Climbing and clawing and trying to get back to the surface. Trying to wake up. She barely did. And when she did, she was screaming from the top of her lungs. Woke me up in the middle of the night. Scared the shit out of me.”\n\nHe shook his head. Like he was trying to deny any of this was even happening.\n\n“She showed me her arms, man. Deep bruises on both of them, in the exact same spots. She said that they were in the exact same places that he grabbed her.” \n\n“What happened next, Martin?” I asked. We needed to stay on target. \n\n“That was it. From there, she just got up and left. Walked out the door. She said that no one could help her. That she felt like she was going to be pulled into some sort of hellish eternity that no one could comprehend. That whatever it was that she felt, it was more real than waking life. Like *that* was the truth. She kept going on about how she felt trapped, and that the only way to avoid what was waiting for her was to not fall asleep. That was the only thing she cared about. *Not falling asleep.* Not me, not her family, friends, dreams, her future just… escaping what was coming for her. She was going to find some way to never fall asleep again. She packed a bunch of nonsensical crap into a travel bag and just left. Drove off, despite me trying to convince her otherwise. It felt like my words were just going through her. I haven’t seen her since.”\n\nMartin was convincing, for sure. It sounded like whatever he was saying, he *did* really believe it. \n\nBut that didn’t change the fact that we needed to call the authorities. \n\n“We need to call the cops, man. Maybe they can find her.”\n\n“You don’t understand. She was right,” he said. \n\n“What do you mean?”\n\nMartin was full-blown emotional at this point. \n\n“It’s real man. I’m seeing it too. Everytime I go to bed, before I fall asleep, I see him. It’s just like she described. In the blackness and the partners and the the colors, I see his silhouette in the distance. It’s so obvious. He’s right there. And he’s getting closer and closer. H-he finally reached me for the first time. Grazed me on my arm. Felt like it was just a light touch, but then I woke up with…” \n\nHe rolled up his sleeve on his left arm, revealing a very deep, dark purple bruise.\n\n“Like seriously man, what the fuck?!” he continued. “I’m just… she was right man. I can’t sleep. Anytime I even nod off, I see him emerge from the darkness, fixating on getting closer to me. Fixating on… pulling me under.”\n\nMartin was the worst I’d ever seen him. Throughout his whole telling, he was scanning the Starbucks, eyeing the door. Eyeing everyone. Afraid. I couldn’t deny it, my hair was starting to raise as well. Whatever he was talking about, whether it was real or not, it felt like an awful and unsettling happening. I didn’t like any of this. \n\n*But*, neither he nor I were equipped to deal with this. The only thing I could think of at this exact time  (besides hoping and praying that it was all just some delusional babble on his part and we could pull him out of his psychosis) was to get the authorities involved because there was a missing person. \n\nWe spent some time trying to talk about less eerie topics than what he and Sophia were supposedly seeing. Eventually, I was able to break through to him and remind him that I was on “his side” and ultimately I convinced him that calling the authorities was the right move. He called the authorities about Sophia’s departure and what she was experiencing, and they had both of us come by to the station to answer questions about the last time either of us had seen her and what her state of mind was at the time of her departure. Separately of course. \n\nAt the station, the cops were a bit more lenient with me - Martin had let them know that I was the one that told him to call them in the first place, so they ended up correctly sizing me up as a guy who was pretty much clueless about all of the happenings. Beyond the standard questions of “When did you last see Sophia” and “Did you sense anything different about her in the last few months?” (my answers being quite useless as I rarely see her unless it’s a big gathering or something), they started asking me questions about Martin and his relationship with her: If he’d ever showcased erratic behavior before, if their relationship was on the rocks, that kind of stuff. I definitely know that Martin was going through some *deep stuff*, but the more I thought about it, the more I was sure that he just couldn’t be responsible for anything grizzly. At his core, he was still the guy I knew: lawful good. Just… struggling with something a bit incomprehensible right now. \n\nThe cops let me go home. I tried texting and calling Martin but didn’t hear anything for the night, so I assumed he was still in questioning or being kept there overnight.\n\nSame thing happened the next day - my calls and texts were left unreturned. I heard nothing from him. I contemplated calling the authorities again to ask for a status update, but opted instead to just hope for the best and try to keep my mind off things.\n\nFinally, after a few days, my phone buzzed.\n\nIt was a text from Martin. I read it:\n\n“Hey. They’ve been keeping me under supervision. They haven’t told me if I’m a person of interest in Sophia’s disappearance yet. They haven’t confiscated my phone yet and I’m still allowed to make calls, but I can’t leave.”\n\nShit. That’s not good. Before I could start typing my reply, I received another one.\n\n“It’s getting worse. I’m trying to stay awake. Every time I close my eyes and drift off, he gets closer. He’s going to pull me in. Tell the officers that they have to try to help me stay awake. I can’t fall asleep. I can’t.” \n\nWelp. I doubt I could convince the officers of anything at this point. Stirring over what to type as my response, he sent me another text:\n\n“Nothing else is more important to me. Not Sophia. Not you. Nothing. I can’t get pulled under. I know what’s coming for me. I understand what’s real now. I need to stay awake. I need to stay awake forever. I can’t go.” \n\nA knife was twisting in my stomach. I had no idea what any of this was, and how anything could impact my friend’s mind this much under such a short period of time. I could see more texts coming in, but I didn’t want to read them. I wanted to puke. Every part of my rational mind was starting to melt - the slow unsettling thought of the supernatural being a real and malicious thing was creeping in. I couldn’t let it in. \n\nI ignored it. I tried to get my mind off it. I watched a comedy, and I went to bed. It was hard to sleep and forget everything, but I powered through the best I could. \n\nI avoided my phone the next day. I kept my mind on other tasks. The sinking feeling was still in my chest, but I fought it as much as I could. I took a walk, watched TV, spent extra time cooking for myself, and continued to find other ways to kill time. I was able to carry through with distracting myself until the evening, where I was finally mentally and emotionally ready to address the rest of the text messages that Martin had sent me, as well as any other spam that had come through during the day.\n\nI scrolled through the chain of messages from Martin:\n\n“I need to stay awake forever.”\n\n“I need to stay awake forever.”\n\n“I need to stay awake forever.”\n\n“They’re threatening to take me to a psychiatric hospital since I won’t go to sleep. Please stop them.”\n\n“They want me to take sleeping pills. Please help.”\n\n“I think they’re going to confiscate my phone.”\n\n“I NEED TO STAY AWAKE I NEED TO STAY AWAKE I NEED TO STAY AWAKE”\n\nI shrunk the above down for brevity, but his final message kept going on and on. A near endless string of him typing “I NEED TO STAY AWAKE”. It was horrifying. What the fuck was going on.\n\nAs I took in the messages, I realized that all of these had been sent by him last night. There’d been no text messages sent by him today. Complete radio silence from him after yesterday turned to midnight. \n\nBefore I could muster up sending him a text or calling him, a phone call came through on my cell. I answered.\n\n“Martin?”\n\n“Hello, this is Officer Borowitz. Am I speaking with Brian?”\n\n“Yes… this is Brian.”\n\n“We have an update on Sophia’s case. We’d love it if you came down to the station.”\n\nI drove to the station, again ping-ponging worst case scenarios in my head on the journey there.\n\nI arrived. I was brought into a room and was sat down by a couple of officers. They talked me through everything that had happened. The “conversation” was at times a flurry of questions, and at other times, a half-hearted update on what had happened. The whole thing was a blur. \n\nI remember a mish-mash of scattered questions throughout the hours they spoke to me:\n\n“Do you know if Martin had plans to escape our supervision area last night? Did he tell you about any plans he had?”\n\n“Were Sophia and Martin part of a cult?”\n\n“Do you know if Sophia and Martin were in close communication over the last week?” \n\n“Were Martin and Sophia ever suicidal?”\n\nAmidst their questioning, I kept asking them what happened. They danced around it for a while, and then tried to quickly skirt over it before proceeding back to their questions. I think they were just trying to keep things as professional as possible while getting as much info from me as they could. They mentioned what had happened, almost as if it was a throwaway fact. Like it was nothing of real importance:\n\nThe cops found Sophia and Martin’s bodies. They were both lying next to each other in their bed. back at their home. Their heads, from the bridge of their noses upwards, had been removed. Mouth, nose, and a blank expression on their face. Everything else was gone. \n\nAmong the grizzly and strange details that were being shared with the emotional intelligence of a seasoned and detached heart surgeon, was the fact that none of the officers had any idea on who had done this. They weren’t sure if Martin and Sophia had planned this themselves, and if they had, how they’d pulled it off. There were no visible signs of foul play, and no hint at all on where the top of Sophia and Martin’s heads were. \n\nThe blur continued and followed me as I went home. I was horrified. Scarred. Life felt empty. I quit work, could barely eat, could barely sleep, and any belief structures I’d set up (or lack thereof) had been completely shattered. I was sure that whatever happened, it wasn’t something that could be explained by any of the tools humans had at their disposal. \n\nMonths passed. Many months before I could have a single solitary day that could even partially resemble what one would call “normal”. But… time does what it does. Slowly, the human spirit builds some sort of strange masochistic resilience. You carry on because you can. And slowly and surely, the guilt and the shame and fear and horror and everything in between, little by little, start to fade away. There was still a big beating heart of pain at the center of me, but… I could get out of bed. I could do things again. I was sleeping better.\n\nThat was until I started seeing him. \n\nTruth be told, I think he’d been there longer than I wanted to admit. I’d just been in denial.\n\nThere, lingering in the corner of the patterns and particles sprinkled onto a background of black that I’d see with my eyes shut as I was drifting off to sleep… was him. That silhouette hiding in the dark fuzzy static. Something that didn’t belong, far off in the distance. Slowly, so slowly, making his way closer and closer. \n\nHe’s closed the distance over the last few weeks. Everytime I see him, he’s closer and clearer than before. I’ve been in denial. *None of this is real, this can’t be real, I’m just seeing things.* But now, in the instant before I fall into a deep dream, he’s right in front of me. Clear as day. \n\nHe grabbed my arms the other night. I woke up with a row of bruises on both sides. I saw his blank expression. A mouth, and a nose. No eyes, but hair. Locked in on me. Fixated on me. \n\nSophia’s description, or rather, Martin’s retelling of Sophia’s description, was spot on. I got a hint of what happens when he finally takes you away. I heard the words - thousands of voices speaking in languages that were completely unfamiliar, and yet, recognizable. All of them saying, in their own special ways… *Forever.* And me, submerged in something so horrible and incomprehensible and yet something I immediately understand with all of my being. Something horrible I can’t ever escape from. \n\nNothing is more important to me now.\n\nI need to stay awake forever.\n\nI need to stay awake forever.\n\nI need to stay awake forever.\n\nI need to stay awake forever.\n\nPlease, something, help me stay awake forever.",

        "text": "If you are reading this it probably means you are watching my dog. There are a careful set of rules to follow exactly. Follow them and you'll be safe, but if you don't follow them, I wish you the best of luck.\n\n1. My dog's name is Suki, the only time you may and should address him as anything else is when you walk into the room. Then you must say “Hi baby”, this makes him happy.\n\n2. You should take Suki out to the garden at least 5 times a day as he can become quite energetic, and you do not want to deal with that energy in the room. Keep a close eye on him, he can disappear quite easily, and you don't want to have to tell me that you lost my dog.\n\n3. Suki can be quite destructive, so I suggest you put yous shoes on the box that is on my chair. If you see him pulling at the carpet pick him up, put him aside and hide the part of the carpet he ripped. If my dad funds out, he will get rid of Suki and I will come for you. \n\n4. Suki is not allowed to walk freely in the house, so keep the door shut. The only time Suki is allowed out of my room is when he is with you in the garden. If he does run out of my room you better get him back inside and pray that the camera outside my room didn't pick him up.\n\n5. Keep the window open during the day but close it at night. You don't want whatever is out there to get you in your sleep. Suki will not be able to protect you since they will kill him first.\n\n6. I have a bird in my room. He doesn't like Suki. If he starts screaming, throw a blanket over his cage. He is trying to call them. \n\n7. Suki needs to be fed three times a day for him to stay happy.\n\n8. Suki is a very sweet pup. If he licks you or plays with you it means he likes you.\n\n9. When you come into my room and you have greeted him, sit on the floor with him for a bit. He will come lay on your lap.\n\n10. Suki is not allowed on the bed. If he falls off he can get hurt and then he can't protect you.\n\n11. Suki sleeps under the bed. He may not be able to protect you from what's outside, but he can protect you from the monster under the bed\n\n12. Once I come home, I will ask my bird how you treated my pup. Though he does not like Suki, he is always honest and will not tell a lie. If you succeeded to follow these rules, you will be rewarded with any item of your dream, but if you broke the rules you better hope I never find you.",

        "text": "A potent, musty smell clung to the air. It was thick and gloopy; cold and smooth like wad of honey. Heavy and intruding, the smell was smokey like cooked ham. Accenting the air, the lukewarm sun layered itself with the cold sweeping of the wind. Before me lied a river, which gushed with furiosity. Condensing the air that drifted close to it, there appeared to be a sheet of vapour drifting over the bitter water. It was here that I found myself most evenings of my adolescence, sat stout on a little path of crackly stone steps that led right into the water, designed so boats could take to the land. Adorning  the riverside towpath was an assortment of trees. Each leaf was a different hue, forming an ensemble of golden yellows, muted greens and bloody reds. They were yet to tumble to the floor, and find themselves embedded in the squishy, wet mud. The rusty colours, the mellow, smokey must, the stirring warmth all melded to form a golden tenderness. \n\nBut soon, a black gloom began to sneak into the orange sky. Fog sprouted from and around the river, which now appeared like dark, shattered glass. The frowsy haze became thin and soft before a sharp cold struck through it. Night had fallen quickly, leaving a terrific cold. Though I was dressed snugly, I still felt a chilly sting that made my hands and spine feel tight and stiff. Silent aside from the running water and distant motorway; the smell of gassy fuel filled my senses. Nights felt so palpable, like you could cut straight through them. The freezing air seemed to latch on and bundle you up tightly, the moon was obscured and shrouded behind an expanse of pale fog, and it's moonlight was twisted and bastardised as it broke through the mist. \n\nI loved the riverside, the towpath, the water and everything else besides. I sat like a toadstool beside it. Tonight, all that preoccupied my static thoughts and blank gaze was the swans that glided like doughy clouds over the slick water. They were always sinister looking animals. They had very little eyes, no larger than a screw, which I remember being the most frightening part about them when I was younger, other than their very confronting size. I'd seen them do battle with dogs, snarling like rattlesnakes and battering their chests with their enormous wings. They had egregiously long necks, bent and craned, coiled so that they were ready to strike, and they often did. I watched them each night grapple, chomp and bite as one pursued another at a dishearteningly scary pace in the water. \n\nIn truth, I'd always been more at peace with animals, though I was only really drawn to the ones untypical to consort with. For eleven nights in a row, I'd seen what I believed to be a local fox gallivanting or otherwise running amuck. He came out late, so I'd only ever see him cast by static street lamps or by light seeping from windows as he crept gingerly around people's homes, tearing sluggishly into their bin bags and vegetable gardens. \n\nOnce, as I sat desperately still in my garden one September night, the fox had trusted me enough to creep close. He was lightly treding across the rain soaked ground, stalking insects in the grass. His shrewd, long face was focussed, and he arked his slender body, ready to pounce. Close as he had come, he seemed to be weary of me, but not provoked. Often, we'd find butchered pigeons over our grass early in the morning; that night I watched the culprit roughly pat and slash at the worms in the grass, scooping them between his paws and haphazardly trying to shove them in his snarling jaws. After he was finished, and his chops were battered in mushy worm discharge, he looked at me and flopped onto his side like a playful cat. \n\n I decided to brave an approach. He was much larger up close, his fur seemed more puffed out, whereas he usually seemed quite skinny and wretched. Remember, these aren't beautiful country foxes with fur as orange as pumpkins - these lot were dim, ratty little urban creatures. \nHe sat calmly, not in the least bit startled as I gingerly reached out my hand to pat his head. He pulled away before I could, sulking off once more. He'd burrowed a little escape ditch bellow my garden fence, which was frequented by his kind and cats alike, and from there he scuppered off into obscurity. \n\nThough the pleasantry of night time solidified my incorrigible loneliness, I wasn't stupid enough to sit there till the sun limply spat its glow into the haze of autumn. The next morning I had to trudge to work, arriving barely after morning prayers had subsided. \n\nThe emerald green spire of St Anne's Church shot up tall and poked the belly of the sky. A beautiful feat of architecture once, in the twilight of its long weighing concernment, the church was as impressive as a chicken shop; as stately as a field of grass. Pigeons cradled themselves cozily within the grime-soaked nooks of the church; wrapping their soot drenched wings around their sunken frames. Having long made the roof their nests, they purred deeply and laconically; constantly. Along the steeples, outside and in, they fluttered, scooted and cooed without respite. During mass, you could hardly hear the sermon, and instead just them. \n\nThat morning, above the doorway on the centuries old stone ridge above it, sat a content crow that loomed it's head forwards to look upon me. I parted the large wooden doors that barricaded the church shut. I felt like a child opening the seal to a great tomb, and a tomb it very much was. A congression was filtering out of their seats as I stood stolid in their way. They filtered out all around me, their lemon faces slowly tuning into smiles. They were mostly old ladies and gentlemen, plus a few young families - the kind who you'd imagine dressed in cardigans, cactus green trousers, polished shoes and such. Once they had dissipated, there was no one inside aside from a lonely priest: Father Bramwell. He sat in the middle of the church's rowed seats, slumped over and dryly mumbling to himself.\n\n\"Father.\" I said shyly, though my voice still boomed like an actress' in the church. Bramwell spun around to properly sit facing me, and didn't justify the extended period of silence by looking deep in thought, but instead just stared back with disembodied nothingness. \n\"Hello.\" He said, twisting his face into a smile. I collected my gear from the cupboard opposite the toilets and got to work. \n\nThe courtyard was a grotty mess and no morning was ever without toil. The first day I'd starting working here, the grass was thick and twisted like extension cords, so much so that the lawnmower cut through it about as smoothly as it would've concrete. I felt the old boar choke to near-death more than once, only resuscitated once I pried a network of smudgy garden waste from its jaws. Thick mud skirted the base of the church proper, but all I had at my disposal to rid it was a gimpy little plastic spade more suited to chucking up sand in the play area than churning mud thicker than a double-glazed window. It resembled more of a spork once it was cleared. It was no wonder this place had fallen so dishevelled, to the point that the Church of England was now eager to cough up a wage and sort it out. \n\nEveryday looked like this, aside from Mondays and Saturdays, where I layed sardonically slumped in my bed and got up to a whole lot of nothing. I'd burn through sludge and squalor in the church gardens, sometimes slinging pigeons out of the toilet cubicles with the butt of my broom, then I'd retire to the riverbank, never quite losing my love for it even as the temperatures turned to somber or the winds blew a fierce squall. \n\nOften at the church they'd have itinerant groups of schoolchildren, drawn away their bemusement and education to learn about the crucifixion, the Nativity, though at this time of year it was a fairly uninviting episode of the Bible being told. On a day marked by devout and pounding rainfall, Father Bramwell had about thirty of the children enthralled when I came in to take my break. I don't remember the story he was telling, but I assure you that you could guess it correctly. I'd gone to their primary and experienced the same three stories over and over again. \n\nI was well versed in his world, at least compared to most people. I'd gone to a Catholic primary school and been raised in a highly Christian orphanage. Though many years separated me and my stint in the world of Christianity, through the innocuous mediums of the internet, I'd delved into the oddly disturbing worlds of the Bible, folklore and various religions - dead, obscure and thriving. As the months floated by, I'd only felt more compelled to pick the brain of my resident Anglican priest on these matters that vested my mind thoroughly. It was that day that I would, as Bramwell came and sat with me. \n\nThe children piled around one another on the floor of the hall, their teacher among them, as Bramwell stepped into his kitchen. The church was his home as much as it was apart of the community, he lived here and kept an open door. I could hardly even imagine how he stomached it and kept even his stingy smile. I didn't know how to initially set up my string of questions. This was my first attempt at talking to the guy, I didn't even have a goddamn interview, so I watered him down with some inoffensive small talk, but he soon choked down his biscuits and quickly returned to teaching. \n\nThe next day, I tried anew, my intrigue into the mind of this priest growing further. We built up a brief rapport, though I soon felt the pressure of his lazy gaze mounting before he commented that he didn't like keeping me so long from work. \n\nBut the third day brought my mission to salvation. A new score of schoolchildren, this time from a couple years above the first, had come for their lesson. It proved to be as banal as the other attempts at investing these young minds in God, but these lot bore the hallmarks of a disgruntled, bored and non-believing lot, the kind I had grown into at their age. The church really should've stuck to the old script of warmongering, concubines, prophecies, philosophy and city squashing, because the Feeding of the Five Thousand wasn't doing much for this enlightened pack of characters. I met Bramwell again in the kitchen; he seemed a little comforted -- likely as his sullen face matched mine. \n\nOur idle chatter began to flow more naturally than before, perhaps because I was the only one paying him any attention. For the first time, I had earnest pity for the man, as he looked very out of it. \n\"Do you think they'd respond better if you were telling stories about Thor and Loki?\" He actually laughed, the first time I'd seen him do so. His real smile was nowhere near as laughably plastic as his engineered one. \n\"You're probably right.\" He murmured placidly. The door was open ajar. \n\"Weren't this place once a... pagan, kinda, worship place?\" I asked him. Clearly excitedly, Bramwell began stammering as he spoke, though he wasn't even going particularly fast. \n\n\"Most churches in England, I can't speak too confidently elsewhere, but defiently most former 'pagan' countries, churches are located in important places to the community. And in the pre-christian times that you're thinking of, the same can be said for their places or sites of worship, so while this church is not medieval or Anglo-Saxon, this would've been the main designated spot for the town to worship for either religion. So not only was it just, you know, convenient worship right here, but in a way the church also wanted to stress a continuation between the old religion and new. Do you get what I'm saying?\" \n\"I guess, yeah.\" I said despite his speech being a jarbelled mess. \"Can I ask you a question? It might be a bit... unkind.\" \n\"Go ahead.\" He welcomed with a smile. \n\"I kind of view your beliefs in a historical way, you know, so when I think of Christianity I think of the middle ages, kings and, you know, all these ridiculous and other worldly people that I can't really relate to. How do you view your religion?\" \n\"I view it as for today.\" He answered sumptuously. \"These beliefs, they invest my everyday, they're not just fairy tales.\" \n\"Alright, I get you.\" I basically murmured. I couldn't help but think I'd insulted him, especially once he rose from his seat. \n\"We'd better get back to it.\" He finished, leaving me to garner more questions, snowballing them all in my brain. \n\nOver the next two weeks, Bramwell and I always discussed these things during our breaks. Most days I didn't exactly understand what he was taking a break from. People would come and go from the church to speak to him or to rent out the hall for their kid's birthday parties. I'd even seen him hearing a couple of confessions. My back grew weak with all my labours, though a peculiar acquaintanceship was beginning to emerge between me and Bramwell that I strangely took to. We discussed the more sinister parts of the Bible, he told me which parts he truly didn't believe, we spoke on the Day of Judgement and the very intimate nature of his beliefs and world view, which I grew far more fascinated with than I had ever thought I would be. I wasn't too proud and militant to shoot down what he had to say, even if I discerned each story he told me as a fable, rather than the historical fact he believed it to be. I was perfectly happy to imagine a world where the supernatural can coexist with our founded banality, though I could only do it by leaving reality at the door. \n\nBut it was one detail of one story that particularly stuck with me. We were again talking about the Vikings, one of our more secular tangents, when he mentioned a man named Olaf Tryggvason. \n\"He was the man who would one day become king of Norway,\" Bramwell explained. \"During his reign, he was very forceful with converting the populations to Christianity. But did you know, he was once here?\" \n\"Really?\" \n\n\"It was in, I believe, the 980s. Olaf Tryggvason was a Christian who fared from the Orkney Islands, which were pretty thoroughly Norwegian at the time. Norway itself was still a deeply pagan country. There had been a Christian king before this, but he made a poultry attempt at converting the locals. It would be Olaf who kept this conversion going, however, but that's not till later. He had spent time in Russia and now, despire being a Christian, he set his sights on raiding the British Isles. He came here with his viking marauders, and sailed up the Thames. They sacked Maldon, Staines and Reading, but they also stopped here in Putnam Green.\" \n\n\"Wow.\" I murmured. \"And what, did they attack the town?\" \n\"Some of them probably caused a stir, but that's not the main part.\" He quickly moved on. \"We have records, kept in London, that a couple of the pagans were converted right here, where we're sitting. Well, you know, at whatever church was here at the time.\" \n\"That's fucking awesome.\" I said. \"Sorry, for, uh...\" \n\"No worries.\" He laughed it off. \"But have you ever been told about the tomb?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"You know Hergenby, down the river about an hour away?\"\n\"Yeah, of course.\" \n\"Little know fact - it's short for old English, I believe: hergend byrgel.\" He explained. \"Or, Plunderer's tomb. It's named after one of these vikings who was buried up there.\" \n\nThe story clung to my brain like fungus, as so many of Bramwell's tales did. I obviously didn't buy into many of his subtle persuasions, but this I had no reason to doubt. The idea of the burial site beguiled me far greater than any unsubstantial story or historical epic - this was something tangible, maybe even still physically amidst my everyday surroundings. \n\nI coveted every piece of information that drew me closer to the tomb, the raiders who came to my town over a millennia ago. At first it began as a general probe over every available video and documentary I could find online and soon I found myself staying awake for long nights watching them, reading and scouring every website that made mention of King Olaf or my towns history. The details were sporadic - barer than a sterile wasteland. It almost felt mocking, as though the information was being withheld to tantalise me even further.\n\nI paid for access to the church records next, the ones Bramwell had mentioned. Soon I stayed up in the dark on my computer so late, I felt my eyes begin to wilt and grow foggy and dry; pusy and red and squinting. I sat by the riverbank with a notepad, my phone and an Old English translation book, scanning over archaic documents and works compiled by men of a different age to my own. It was wonderfully spiritual, my descent into obsession. \n\nAnd soon I believed I had the answer. There was no church in Hergenby anymore. The site that once housed Saint Edmund's Church was demolished in 1652, a former Catholic priory. Now standing there was a rugby club, who's field backed onto a row of plotted Victorian houses. If the viking was a Christian, he would have been buried there centuries before its destruction. I found it impossible to quench my hunger any further, I set off for Hergenby as soon as the sun rose.",

        "text": "\nMy parent’s recently moved out of state. They invited me over their new place for the holidays. I packed and left with my girlfriend and our dog. It was about an 8 hour drive, not so much because of the distance but the roads were impossible to navigate. The final 2 hours of our journey were solely focused on traversing the winding mountain roads and looking for this town that practically didn’t exist. The worst part is driving through absolute wilderness where roads can be completely blocked by downed trees or other natural obstacles, where theres no cell connection and you’re completely isolated.  \n\nWe arrived at their house in the late afternoon. It was a small 2 story house on a narrow winding road backed by woods. When we arrived we were greeted by my parents. They didn’t seem happy to see us but I wrote this off as it just being a bit later than they’d hoped. They invited us in and began preparing dinner. The house was small but impeccably organized, not clean but tidy. It reminded me of my grandparents house when I was a kid, everything was kind of old and gross but it was kept neatly. My girlfriend assured me this was just a symptom of getting old. My parents didn’t know the name of our dog. They’d met him multiple times. Our dog King, a golden retriever in his prime, sat loyally at my side. My parents seemed to scowl at him, even after I had offered to leave him outside multiple times. \n\nNeedless to say I was a bit perturbed by my parents sudden shift in personality, but I was unsure how to approach them about the subject. We began wondering if it was okay for them to stay here alone by themselves with potential dementia developing. It was then that I felt a presence, a sort of unwelcome heaviness in the air. My girlfriend and I both looked to the door to see the shadows of feet cast beneath the door. After a moment they continued down the hall. \n\nThe next day King was barking incessantly at my mother. We were  sent to get groceries in town. Everyone I met on my journey to the store was friendly and talkative, it made me feel better about the whole situation. On the way back from the store my girlfriend and I discussed our plan. We deliberated that we would feel out the situation over the week and then decide what we’d do. Upon returning we found that King had gone missing. My father claimed he ran down the street. He also had his hand wrapped in a rag.  The dinner the served was gray and unpalatable.\n\nYesterday morning I got up early to continue searching for King. I had driven around town yesterday but I hoped today someone would have taken him in and i could locate him. I got back to the house around 8am after deciding to search again in the afternoon. \nMy father was preparing to go to work and I made myself breakfast with what little food they had in the house. I dont know what possessed me to follow my father but I did. I watched him drive his car down the street and pull off the road. I walked up and quietly followed him into the woods. He led me to a work site of some sort. Various tools lay around a large hole in the ground. He just kept digging. I confronted him asking what was going on. He just dropped his shovel and stared at me. With this fucked up look on his face, slack jaw and glassy eyes. He didn’t say a word. I was freaked out so I backed away slowly.\n\nOn my way back up I crossed paths with my mother she told me she was heading out for the day. I already knew exactly where she was going. They didn’t arrive until late that night. I asked where they’d been and they just didn’t say anything. I asked how often they “work” and they said every day , except the holidays. I asked what the hole was for and my father made a face, a fleeting expression only visible for a fraction of a second. His brown contorted in anger but his eyes fearful like a pleading animal, And then his face returned to an emotion of nothingness. These weren’t my parents, I felt alienated. I went to make a few local calls about our dog only to find the line was dead. \n\nThat night it took my hours to fall asleep, once I finally did I was shortly awoken by a foul odor, something burning in the house. I shot out of bed yelling for everyone. The halls were full of smoke as I made my way to the living room where and inferno blazed in the fireplace. Smoke billowing into the room permeating every surface. I put out the fire and we all went to bed. The next morning my family didn’t clean anything. Black stains coat every surface in the living room, the stench of smoke sticking to everything. They continued as if nothing happened. After dad went to work. I offered to fix the chimney my mom said nothing but stood as I got down on my hands and knees and looked up into the cavernous passage. I grabbed my flashlight and Looked up. \n\nI was puzzled for a moment and everything went cold. I wanted to throw up and scream and cry.  A large blockage was stuffed into the chimney, only identifiable by the stainless steel tag dangling inches from my face. I didn’t need to read it, I knew exactly what it said. I composed myself as I got out of the fireplace. I told my girlfriend I needed to talk to her and when I was confident we were alone I told her to drive to get us home. \n\nI couldn’t contain myself and broke down explaining everything through tears. Eventually I calmed down. We didn’t know what to do or who to call. On the way out of town one of the thin roads had a fallen tree laid across it. We stopped to get out and halfway through trying to move the log I heard something behind me. It was my father approaching me, wearing that furious yet despondent face. I didn’t hesitate I jumped into the seat and we rammed the log out of the way, destroying our front bumper. We got away and thats what was important. \n\nArriving home we learned I had hundreds missed calls from my family.",

        "text": "Listen reddit! I know your going to judge me but I don’t care, you must feel what I feel. I have to tell this story before I can’t anymore \n\nLet me tell you dear reader, karma is very much real and she is a bitch. I’m going to recount this shot for shot for you, because you need to suffer with me! Oh and to clarify, I am a horrible person, and at this point I don’t care. \n\n————————————————————————\n\nSo recently, newspaper sales have been plummeting. As someone who works for the New York Times, this is a bit troubling. I’ve never given it much thought though, I've just been doing my job.\n\n However, to try and entice the public, we’re doing a short story contest! So here I am stuck picking from the newest submissions. I was shuffling through some rather boring stories. I had just put down one about a cat and a mouse becoming friends when I saw the title. \n\n“I hide in the walls.”\n\nInstantly a chill spread throughout me. A shock of terror striking. The title was certainly… something. I leaned forward and shuffled through the story to find the author's name. There was no name. A creepy story with an anonymous writer. I instantly threw the story in the trash, it brought back… some troubling memories. \n\nI shook off the feeling that someone was looking at me and continued reading the stories. I eventually decided on a story written by a third grader. It was a very cute story about her pet dog who saved her from a fire when she was young. Happy with my choice, I went home.\n\nThere's nothing better than a hot bath after work, that's my personal motto anyway. After my bath, I made dinner, watched TV, and eventually got ready for bed. I shut the lights off and collapsed into bed. \n\nI tossed and turned trying to find a comfortable spot. For some reason I just could not relax tonight. I found a good spot and began to drift off, right when the dreamworld was tugging my consciousness I heard a noise:\n\nTap… tap… tap… tap… tap… tap… tap… tap…\n\nWhoever was tapping allowed each tap to fully echo through the room before the next tap. The sound continued. I ran over to the lightswitch and flicked the light on. I must be dreaming. I pinched myself, surprised when I felt the protest of pain. \n\nThe tap continued. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end, tears threatened my eyes, my face felt frozen, I felt a sunken feeling underneath my rib cage, and a strong itch at the back of my mind was screaming for me to turn around. I did. Nobody was there, yet the sickening noise dragged on. Then a knock. \n\nKnock, knock, knock, knock \n\nI live alone now.\n\nThey were knocking from inside of the wall. \n\nA static terror bolted through me, working its way from my head to my legs. I heard a shuffling noise. I whirled around in terror, sucking in a gasping breath. \n\nA slow drag of nails scraped. Over and over. \n\nI felt a string tug between my shoulder blades, spinning me around the room, surrendering to every natural instinct that could get me out of this. Scrape, scrape, scrape. \n\nI covered my ears. The person began pounding on the wall. Louder and louder, repeating the same pattern. Boom, boom-boom, boom, boom-boom. Horror ran through my spine and spread through my veins. I was frozen in place, my hands limp at my sides.\n\n“Hi”\n\nIt spoke\n\nA little shriek escaped me. The voice was high pitched and girly, like a young childs. \n\n“Do you think you can help me?”\n\nMy hands trembled, tears now flowing down my cheeks. \n\n“Mommy said that I was annoying her.”\n\nI sank to the floor and started to bawl.\n\n“She said that maybe I would stop bothering her in the wall.”\n\nI shrieked. \n\n“Of course, you remember, don’t you mommy?”\n\n\n“I’m sorry!” I screamed “I’m sorry! I didn’t-”\n\n“Don’t lie. You told me that good people don’t lie.”\n\n“I-”\n\n\n“I used to tap on the table, that made you angry.” \n\nShe tapped. I cried even harder. \n\n“Seems to still bother you, huh?” \n\nI sucked in a gasping breath.\n\n“I knocked on your door in the middle of the night, I felt sick.”\n\n“Please, stop!”\n\n“You had a hole in the wall, all ready for me, dragged me over to it, I grabbed for the wall, my nails scraped.”\n\nThe memories flooded my head, I screamed. \n\n“You remember? Putting the dresser in front of the hole so I couldn’t get out? Do you remember me pounding on the walls screaming for help?”\n\nI glanced over to the dresser, my visions flicked, the vision of her screaming. \n\n“Yes.” \n\n“That's what I thought.” \n\nA giggle that very much belonged to my daughter came from the wall. \n\n“I do hope you get used to this.” \n\nEvery night, the torture happened, first a tap, then a knock, a scrape, and pounding. I can’t take it! I can’t take it! This is my last night alive. I’m going into that wall, and I’m never coming out.\n\n I’ll hold my daughter once more, I’ll hold her decaying body and watch it taunt me until my last breath.",
