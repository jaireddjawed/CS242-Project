Get stuck behind one going 10 miles under the speed limit and then pass them and speed up to make up for lost time when you can? That's gonna be a call.\n\nSo yesterday I got back from a delivery and heard the phone ring. It was a woman sounding angry asking for the manager, oh boy! So i got my manager and continued getting the next delivery ready. Then right before I leave, my boss pulls me aside and angrily tells me I've got another complaint, about how I almost hit another car when entering the parking lot and how they said I was texting and driving.\n\nHeres the thing: None of that happened. I hadnt looked at my phone since i left from the house i last delivered at, and there was nobody going in or out or even driving around the parking lot when I pulled in. Of course I was confused and told her that I had no idea what they were talking about because there was nobody else driving around me, and that I hadnt messed with my phone.\n\nThen it hit me: There is a line of parking spots, connected on the other side by more parking spots, basically a rectangle of parking spots two parking spots thick. One car drove forward a bit from one parking spot to the one in front of it and then stopped, so I kept moving forward once I saw I wasnt gonna get hit. I can only imagine that the car was the one who called in, angry that I didn't let them out immediately or that they had to stop for a car that had the right of way?\n\nBasically, I was told too bad, it doesn't matter if I did something wrong or not, I got a call and they had to log it. They forced me to sign one of those \"I'm at fault\" things and said the next time I get a complaint I'm fired.\n\nSo thanks, random jerk who put my job in jeopardy because you didn't like that I had the right of way and that you needed to stop!",

I always feel like I'm being watch from around a corner or something is behind me. I get breakfast from QT or Dunkin' Donuts after I drop off the deposit to the bank, and if I'm still the only one in the store then I eat in my car so I don't have to be in the store. This happens to me whenever I'm alone at open or close. I was bringing my cook home tonight and he was saying that he felt like someone was standing right behind him the other day but when he turned around he realized he was the only person in the back of the store. Weird stuff happens a lot too, such as things falling off perfectly flat shelves, people seeing someone walk around a corner but no one is actually there, and I'm not the only person who feels extremely uneasy when they're alone in the store. Anyone else get this kinda stuff at their location?",

However, when the driver arrived at Bob's apartment, he told the driver that they can't eat the double chocolate brownie because it has chocolate sauce on top. To be more specific he said that the chocolate sauce on top means he can't eat it because he's a diabetic. \n\nThis is a brownie that is made of chocolate with chocolate chips in it and chocolate sauce on top. At what point did they think that ordering that was okay if they are a diabetic?\n\nThe manager, let's call him Tom, tries to explain this to the Bob. However, Bob seems to think that we're being rude by explaining this to him. He tells Tom that he can fuck off and hangs up.\n\nTom calls back to try to apologize just in case he seemed condescending. However Bob would not answer his phone. So Tom drove out to his apartment to sort out if this was a prank or not. Bob called Tom a motherfucker, and a verbal argument ensued. Tom tells Bob he's no longer allowed to order. \n\nThis is the shit we have to put up with. Stupid do you have to be to pull this shit?",

It seems a lot of these stories wouldn't even be on here if the customer just said thanks and gave a tip. I just don't understand how people can justify forking out $20 for a pizza; yet $2 for a tip seems preposterous.\n\nI also just want to really thank you guys for delivering pizza.

I had a delivery to a big mansion that was gated and had one of those [circular driveways.](http://americanpavingdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hysche14updated.jpg)\n\nWhen I arrived, the gate was open. I parked, went up to the door and knocked. Since I was already late, I decided I should whip out the pizza now so they can just take it when the door opens. So I do that and put the red bag on a bench next to me.\n\nWhen the woman answers, she tells me to come inside, we do the transaction and I leave. About an hour later I notice we're short a bag and nobody was out on a run. I run to check my car and its empty.\n\nThat's when I remembered I put the bag down on the womans porch and never grabbed it. As the panic sets in, I decide I shouldn't tell anyone (which was probably a good idea considering)\n\nI eventually get a run, but its 2 deliveries and 1 of them is near the mansion. I race my way to to first delivery, and then go to the mansion. \n\nThe gate is closed. There's no call button on the box. Its dark, and I'm sitting outside a gated mansion pacing back and forth trying to figure out how to get my bag back. I debated jumping the gate, but I was too chicken. Finally I decide to check their order bill for a phone number. Thank god there's one, and I call it. An old man answers, and I explain my situation. He instructs me to the side of the fence to an unlocked gate. I run up to the porch, counting my blessings with every step and, luckily, the pizza bag was there. I thanked the man on the phone, ran to my next delivery (a church) and actually snagged a $13 tip. \n\nAfter just 1 month here, there are so many stories. A lot don't have happy endings I'll admit, but this one does and my job is still great.",

To up the ante the semifinals for the NFL were happening that day and we doubled down on that thanks to our DM spacing out and forgetting about the game so he gave our GM the day off. It was pure chaos.\n\nI came it at 11 and we already had a scroll bar on our make line queue with only one driver besides me, an AM, and the promise of an insider who was already running pretty late. I also learned that the landlord hadn't had tour building re-roofed since the place was built in the 50s because we had half a dozen streams of water pouring down on us and a lot of buckets scattered around the store. Thank God I decided to wear my heavy boots and bring and extra jacket.\n\nSo it turns out our GM is aware of the cluster fuck brewing in out store and he's blowing up the group chat and other driver's phones trying to get anyone to come in as the other driver and I are taking orders that are already way behind 5 at a time. We had a whole lot of people \"not see the texts.\" The rain is pretty bad and showing no signs of letting up while I'm getting out of my car a block away from the house I'm delivering to thanks to downed trees blocking the whole road or as the other driver is dealing with jerks who won't buzz them in. Part of our routes now involve devouring around all of the idiots who've wrecked thier cars by not having any idea how to handle the rain. A couple drivers are finally trickling in to help out but we're still taking orders 5 at a time (that's the maximum amount our dispatch allows) and leaving behind a sea of red timers as the order queue gets longer and longer. The flooding started about now too.\n\nSo if you weren't already aware there's been a big push in Southern California to make your lawn \"drought friendly\" by letting your grass die off and then replacing the grass with native plants that don't use too much water. The downside of this is that between the all the loose dirt from the dying grass and the people who cheaped put and got who'd chips and gravel for thier yards instead of stones all the drains are clogged up and the streets are flooding. The driver group chat is now full of \"don't take _____ street, it's flooded\" and there were no exaggerations here; almost all of our major roadways were submerged to the point of not being able to see the road paint or the curbs and a few smaller cars had already been swept aside by the currents. There were a couple streets he had to start refusing deliveries from as they had been cordoned off by the city for being completely flooded and unsafe to walk on. Orders are still piling up, and I'm becoming very appreciative of my crown Victoria's get-through-pretty-much-anything suspension.\n\nTensions are starting to get high as the blame game is being played on anyone who isn't on the clock right now and our carryout becomes a holding pen for wet and upset customers. We're down an insider who's balling their eyes out in the office after an upset customer took it too far over the phone and the greener drivers are feeling the pressure. It's at this time I come into contact with a driver we'll call tag-a-long because he got hired on the coattails of another guy we hired because he was amway buddies with him or something. Tag-a-long was pretty bad as far as drivers went: he had literally begged the boss for the position yet he spent most of the time following around the guy who got him his interview and not trying to improve his already mediocre skills. Tag-a-long is complaining to me about how wet he is and how he had to come in at 2, blah blah blah, all while I'm writing out my hat and trying to calm him down. He's not having it and says he wants his lunch even though he's been here only 2 hours or so. Whatever, I'm guess I'm gonna pick up his slack as usual. \n\nAn hour later we get word that the dude that got tag-a-long in wrecked his car. Now tag-a-long had no one to hide behind for his BS. He was already getting pretty fresh with our AMs who were taking a lot of customer abuse as it was but after hearing about his buddy he freaked the fuck out at one of them to let him go home. He finally got his wish because he got fired on the the spot. No we're down 2 drivers and things get better because we get word another driver wrecked. This turned out to be some other guy from PJ's though who had the same model and color car as our guy but it was still pretty intense.  We're still taking the delivers 5 at a time, but now we're out of receipt paper and having to make receipts out of order slips and whatever paper we can find.\n\nFast forward a few more hours and a couple completely changes of clothes and the rain is starting to subside to a drizzle while the queue is now something that can all fit on the screen. We lost weight drivers, all our customer ratings are down to half a star from the ridiculously late delivers and people not knowing about our insane queue, but we're all alive. The AM calls me over to get my money and gives me the low-down on what happened with tag-a-long  while I was out on a run. I ended up logging 12 hours and getting 180 dollars in tips and milage reimbursement. As I leave I'm laughing lie a maniac at the drizzle and shouting something about how we won against everything, I don't remember specifics\n\nThat's it for the events of that day alone. I'd put the epilogue here too but it looks like that's gonna be another post as the burger place I'm at is closing up and I gotta be on my way. I'll try to get to that sooner rather than later but until then buckle up and drive safe everyone. ",

        "text": "Ok so I'm normally a driver I'm being made a shift lead, Sunday night was my second time running the shift.\n\nWe close at 10 on Sunday - Thursday and 11 on Friday and Saturday. At about 9:50 a customer comes in and orders for carryout. This alone would make me get out late, but only by like 5 minutes or so, and we're still open so it's not that big of a deal. I don't usually mind getting out late.\n\nSo he gets his pizzas and wings, and the other person with him gets his order. Nothing out of the ordinary. But this is where it gets fucked up. My driver who is also a shift leader, but was driving last night, give him his pizza. He then decided he wants a beer, this is after 10 our system locks us out at 10 because we're closed. She tells him this. Despite just being told that we're closed he says \"Oh we decided we want to eat here.\" Now I don't know if it was just sheer confusion as to how someone decides to eat in after being told we're closed but she just says \"ok?\"\n\nI was in the back so as far as I knew he got his pizza and left but then I hear the door open so being confused as I figured she would lock the door after he left. I come up to see what's going on. And it's that guy. He said \"oh it's just us. We're eating here, I know you guys are closed.\" At this point his entire group is already seated and eating, there was probably 7 or 8 of them. I probably could have told them they needed to leave. But they had already been told ok by the driver, I don't have my manager shirts yet so there was really nothing distinguishing us. And the last thing I want is a complaint to corporate on the second shift I'm running by myself. If they had asked me in the first place I would have said no. But I didn't really feel comfortable asking them to leave when they had already started eating.\n\nThey didn't leave until 10:40. And since I couldn't do my closing cash I had to sit and wait for them to leave, because everything else was done. So I didn't get out of there until after 11.\n\nI don't want to sound like I'm just whining because like I said normally I don't mind getting out late, it would have been nice to get out on time because I had to open Monday morning, but it's not normally a big deal. I'm almost never off on time anyway. The problem I had is how does someone think it's OK to decide they want to eat in and stay for almost an hour after being told that we're closed?\n\n\\*edit* Oh I almost forgot they also almost forgot one of their kids because he was asleep in one of the booths. It took another like 5 minutes just to wake him up to get him to the car.",

        "text": "Name changed for privacy, but here we go: I work at a pizza chain in California and we have this regular customer called Billy. Billy has some kind of mental handicap, but none of our drivers can figure out what it is. He's a super nice guy, and we all kinda feel bad for him. He orders at least once a day, most recently his record is six orders in one day, always the same thing, one large double pepperoni and two \"ice cold\" 2 liter pepsis. He always emphasizes the ice cold part. We think he literally lives off our pizza and soda. Every time one of us goes out to his house it's the same routine: He's sitting on his porch outside waiting for us in his underwear, greets us loudly (he only has one volume to his voice and it's yelling) he has us set the pizza down on the table or in the oven, and put the pepsis in the fridge. The fridge is completely empty. I don't even think he has plates or anything. When he ordered ice cream last night I told the driver taking it that they ought to bring spoons since who knows if he has silverware.. his house looks like a 70s motel room. Flower wallpaper, super vintage furniture, tv with antennae, the whole nine. He always talks to us for 5 or 10 minutes before we go. It's always something new and strange. And he does this little shuffling dance thing when he talks. One time one of our drivers (my bf) took him mountain dews instead of Pepsis and asked him about it. He said he's got a disease. Curious that he was about to find out what was up with him, he asked what kind of disease. Billy just says \"diarrhea\". Apparently he had eaten a mushroom in his backyard and he got sick, and Mountain Dew is the only thing that helps. Last week Billy went off his meds and ordered six times in one day. He had the drivers put the pizzas in the oven, which ended up being stocked full by the end of the night, and he had made a \"spaceship\" out of his pepsis. He told us he doesn't have any family, he's all by himself, which sucks y'know, because like who helps him out when he starts acting crazy off his meds? The night he ordered all that stuff the store had the police do a welfare check on him and he went to get treatment but now he's okay again. I love how he loves to make conversation with the drivers, even though sometimes you can't understand him through the yelling and stuttering. Oh, and he doesn't have a car to get around because he doesn't believe in them, that's why he takes the bus everywhere he goes. Also phones are a no-go, he doesn't like that they all have cameras. The other day he was talking about how he was going to buy this Aston Martin because it didn't have a motor, it just had foot pedals to move. \n\nYesterday, I get to his house and as soon as I'm out of my car I say hey how you doin today Billy? And he starts shouting about how every day is Friday the 13th for him. So I ask him whys that, and he goes on the explain that everyone, everyone goes to Reno on Friday. He asks me if I've ever been to Reno and I say no, and he says great! Let's go to Reno, we'll get lost out there! Then, once inside his house he proceeds to give me detailed directions of how to get to and from Reno.\n\nCrazy, weird, nice guy. I know there's more stories from my coworkers but I can't think of anything else rn. If anyone's interested I'll post whenever something new and interesting happens. We all love Billy.",

Department of Labor](https://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR325/325CR53.pdf) here.\n\nFrom reading the article and the ruling it seems to me that this employer, Amaral Brothers, who operate a Dominos franchise, were petitioning DOL to allow them (Amaral Brothers) to pay their delivery driver employees using tip credit.\n\nThe Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that the delivery drivers must be paid the applicable minimum wage and that no tip credit can be taken.\n\nSo if you are a delivery driver in Connecticut and your employer is taking a credit against your tips, it would seem they are violating the law.\n\nI am not wholly sure if this was occurring, employers using tip credit to pay their delivery drivers, hence the question in the title. \n",

        "text": "From http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/breaking-connecticut-supreme-court-31315/ :\n\n&gt; The DOL denied Plaintiff’s Petition for the following stated reasons: (1) the regulations were valid because they served a remedial purpose, were time-tested and subject to judicial scrutiny…; and (2) the only act of “service” was handing the food to the customer at the customer’s door and so delivery drivers’ duties were not solely serving food as required under Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies § 31-62-E2(c). The DOL’s decision was that only employers of “service employees” as defined by the DOL could utilize the credit, and Plaintiff’s employees were not service employees.\n\n&gt; The Court’s decision traced the origin of the tip credit in a portion of the decision that only lawyers will love. But then they get to the heart of the matter: “It was reasonable for the department to conclude that the legislature did not intend that employees such as delivery drivers, who have the potential to earn gratuities during only a small portion of their workday, would be subject to a reduction in their minimum wage with respect to time spent traveling to a customer’s home and other duties for which they do not earn gratuities.”",

        "text": "Last night I got the best tip I've ever had. We had a future time to order for a birthday party at our Central Park. The order was for seven pizzas, ticket total around $90. So I get there, I walk up to the front entrance with two heavy ass pizza bags in my hand and the front entrance is closed. Well how the fuck am I supposed to deliver your pizza? I walk around a bit to some other doors and see a man walking by, I knock on the glass and he lets me in.\n\n I ask him if he's with the birthday party and says the main hall I'm looking for is just to the left. So I walk in the main hall, there's a slideshow playing on a huge screen with \" Somewhere over the Rainbow\" blasting through the hall, nobody pays attention to the pizza guy slipping into the corner. There were at least 200 people here, I had no idea who ordered. So I called the number on the slip, the guy says that he wants to finish watching the slideshow and if I can wait at least another 10 minutes. I get kind of irritated upon hearing this, but I understand it's a big party and so I sit down outside the main hall and wait. After about 15 solid minutes of waiting, a man walks up and says \"Are you the pizza delivery guy?\" I replied yes, and ask if he's the man who ordered. He told me no but he is related, and hands me a $20 bill.\nDefinitely buttered me, i say thanks and he walks away.  \nAnother 10 minutes goes by, at this point I've been out at least 30 mins on this one delivery. Finally, the man who ordered walks up, hands me another $20 bill and says\" I'm so sorry for the wait.\" I follow him into the main hall, where the slideshow is now over, and put down his seven pizzas as he likes and leave. \n\nA $40 tip. Thats damn good. I wish the transaction was a little quicker, but that was still a great delivery in my book! \nWhats the biggest tip you've ever received and  how did it happen?",

        "text": "I've been delivering pizzas for about a month now. I know this is really minor, but I felt really guilty about messing up a customer's order earlier today. Basically instead of the normal butter seasoning that breadsticks come with, the customer wanted the garlic + parmesan seasoning. I was working the cut table and defaulted to the butter seasoning instead of looking at the receipt and applying the correct seasoning. I noticed my mistake when it was too late, but since we were really busy and the order was due, I decided to just deliver it instead of preparing new breadsticks. After all, I wouldn't be the one to receive any complaints since I usually leave immediately after handing over the food.\n\nThis is where the guilty part comes in. I arrived at the customer's house and was greeted by a nice \"welcome\" sign outside. The mother-son duo that answered the door were the type of people you'd want to be delivering pizzas to: happy to see you and happy to tip. They even counted their cash in front of me, something that nobody else has ever done for me. They left me a nice tip of $5 and some change. As I was leaving, I couldn't help but think about how I messed up their breadsticks and still accepted their generous tip.",

        "text": "I've been working delivery for about two months now and have gotten familiar with the area. Last night a customer calls in an order of two pepperoni pizzas and a bread-stick. When I typed in the computer the address appeared and everything seemed okay about the order and address. I notice a reprint which added a coke to the order; meaning someone else talked to these people and didn't find anything suspect either. The address pulls up on our screen and It's my turn to take the delivery. I search and I see a man in front of where my phone even said the address was. I ask him to confirm his order and he gets all the information right when he comes to pay me he pulls out his gun and a second man runs from a bush he was hiding in with a gun. They took my phone (old piece of shit not worth anything), my wallet (had about 50 because i forgot to put last nights take away up) and they pistol whipped me on the forehead and took my car keys and house keys ( on two separate rings) and fled. The house didn't exist but our store computer and phone navigation still said it was real. I had to go to the closest house and ring the doorbell until someone answered ( A hell of a thing to open the door to). This nice lady opened the door and helped me out by keeping me in her garage to avoid waking her baby. It took 35 minutes for the police to get there (it was literally right around the corner from a police station and pretty straightforward. The first thing police asked was for an ambulance. The police literally could have had them apprehended if they didn't take so fucking long to get to me. They were pretty rude to me and treated me stupid for being set up. They especially were not impressed that it was two black males wearing dark hoodies that bolted into the direction of a main fucking street. The ambulance crew was actually nice to me and once I was in the ambulance it was a party. I wasn't too startled from the actual robbery, I knew they weren't going to kill me (I read their faces it was like I could tell that they were trying to be hard because their environment told them that's how they should be), but they pistol whipped me for the fun of it and once the police came I wasn't worried, I just wanted to go back to the store. Ended up getting six stitches in my forehead and the perpetrators will likely never get caught ( I knew this pretty much immediately after they ran off). Luckily for me regional management has stepped in to cover the cost of medical, replacing my keys/license, a new phone, and the cost to get the car out of impound which i'm trying to figure out how to replace the keys for. All in all this has left me with a high regard for my company taking care of me and a distaste for the police force in my area. \nTL;DR was set up by a well planned robbery which resulted in needing stitches and leaving me nothing in my pockets and my car in the impound lot.

All day, the manager, who is normally a huge dick, former marine guy (who later was arrested for having a thing with one of the 16 year old inside girls who worked there) was trying to get us to be allowed to close because the roads were bad, and other places like the D and Hut were closed, but this was a franchise, and greedy owners.  Oh i forgot to mention, i wasnt even supposed to work that day, i was called and asked if i could come in, i had nothing going on and they needed help because 2 of the drivers, who were friends, had called out.  So later in the day i get a delivery to slightly farther than the farthest we should deliver, but my manager took the order for some reason, even in that weather.  I get to that house and its BOTH of the drivers who had called out, because the weather was bad...and they ordered pizza for delivery.  It was rather enfuriating and when i told my boss he put one of them on some form of probation and fired the other one, because he was relatively new and his loss wasnt that big.  I get calling out, but being that big of morons to think you could get away with ordering pizza from where you work?\n\nAnyone else have any funny stories about coworkers being idiots and getting caught?",

One of the girls at the front desk said something along the lines of 'make sure you leave a nice tip' and the Lady goes \"Oh yeah, I always tip well.\" It was a credit card order and she just had to sign the receipt. So I get back into my car and unfold the paper, and not only is there no tip, she also took the time to write in $0.00 on the tip margin and her total to be exact. \n\nThat is by far the pettiest thing that has happened to me so far. I mean, I'm used to not getting tipped when I go to the college for deliveries, but to tell the front desk people that you were going to leave a tip, and then blatantly not do so, is just the rudest thing you can do to a pizza delivery guy. \n\nPs I'm 70% sure this bitch is in my chemistry lecture...  \n\nUpdate: sitting in my chemistry lecture now and it was definitely her!!!! I'm going to say something after class ends. \n\nAlso I work for Pizza Hut so I need to get a signature before I leave. \n\nUpdate 2: I said \"thanks for the tip last night,\" while she was standing next to all of her friends, said \"I didn't leave a tip\" her friends laughed, and I winked at her, making her think that I wrote one in anyways. \n\nI didn't actually do that, but since she was a massive cunt I had to do something. \n",

I've been reminiscing about my time delivering pizzas for a 'rogue' delivery shop (somewhere in the ~2002 - 2007 timeframe).  Before that, I worked at Pizza Hut for a ~1 year period, before that entire store collapsed/imploded.\n\nI sometimes feel like I've got enough material gathered over the course of those years / those shops that I could easily write a movie or novel - kinda similar in some senses to 'Waiting' if you've ever seen it, but focused more on the insane aspects of pizza delivery, and the crazy shop I worked for in particular.  Wrote like 20 or 30 pages back in 2010, and haven't touched it since (between my current job, new kiddo, etc - project just became de-prioritized over time).\n\nBut that doesn't mean the stories themselves shouldn't be told.  I've got a metric ton of stories, if ya'll are interested to hear them.  May have posted one or two on Ask Reddit over the years, before I found this sub - but always way too late in the life of the thread for anyone to notice, which is always kind-of a bummer to be honest.\n\nBut yeah - would love to hear your best, worst or craziest story.  If you're cool with your story perhaps being used in a novel or a movie one day, please let me know that too - I would absolutely never use anyone else's story without explicit permission.  Also, if you're interested in working on the project, let me know that too - would love to pick it back up again one day.\n\nCheers :)",

Same error message, they must have changed their number and not updated their online account.\n\nLuckily, someone came outside and let me in so I could go up to their unit. I spent several minutes knocking on the door and had no response. Grrrrr. \n\nAs I headed back to the store, I called to let my manager know the number for the order was invalid so that in case they called, he could get a new one. The driver who answered the phone asked which order I was on and when I told him he said they had just called. He gave me their correct info and I headed back to their building. \n\nI rang them and said cheerfully that I had returned with their order and thanked them for having had the foresight to call the store. When they came out, I saw through the window that they had been in the apt building's TV room just off the lobby, that answered why they hadn't heard me knocking. They weren't in their own apt. \n\nThey seemed a little distant but tipped me a fiver, so I didn't think too much of it. People often have their own problems. \n\nHere's the kicker. When I came back into the store I saw the notice that we had customer feedback on the delivery screen, I checked it. It was from the people who I had just delivered to, who had not supplied a working phone number and weren't in their own damn apartment. It was all 1 stars (out of five) and the comment was \"It took too long to get here.\" \n\nIf they hadn't tried their best to fuck everything up, I would have been handing them that food 17 minutes after they placed their order, as it was, it was at 26 minutes when I finally made the handoff. \n\nIt took too long, really, guys???

Now, because a few of the other guys have been showing up in t-shirts and the managers never did anything about this, the owner came by and decided that the drivers have to dress the same as the people working inside. \n\nI am pretty annoyed by this as the job requires tons of movement and lifting and climbing on top of the fridge to get boxes etc... I also sometimes help bag the food, but I am not standing there cooking in dress clothes by an over while the chefs are in bob marley tshirts, fuck that make me a front person or a delivery driver and I'll dress accordingly \n\nI am thinking of getting the owner's phone number or email and anonymously explaining that poor management and specific employees are the problem, as their incompetence has left us all in a shitty position. Oh, we also used to have driver shirts provided by the owner and now I have to go and buy a new wardrobe and  I honestly don't have the money so I'm wearing these pants and shirt all week.\n\nAny advice or tips or other stories can help me chill out and I'm just curious if anyone has dealt with something like this. I like this job a lot but the managment is so terrible.",

        "text": "Last night I was delivering to an apartment complex near my store. This apartment had multiple buildings, 10 I believe. Each apartment building had 8 rooms, each room's number corresponded to its building number, i.e. building 7 apt 4 would be apt 704. This order was submitted online with no apartment number, just \"CALL\" in the instructions. This apartment complex isn't especially unique, there are plenty like it in my area, and it's very easily navigable. When I called to get the apartment number, the following conversation ensued\n\nMe: \"hey there, this is unhappy_flyer with (restaurant), I have your delivery and I'm at your apartment complex, but I don't have an apartment number. What apartment am i going to with this order?\"\n\nCustomer: \"Oh he's here (random dialogue in background, followed by a long pause) ok now see you're gonna come through the gate, go straight, keep looking to the right-\"\n\nMe: \"uh dude I just need the apartment number, I'm familiar with the layout\"\n\nC: \"no see you gotta come in the gate, once you come in keep going straight but look to the right and you'll see a green light-\"\n\nMe: \"wait man, I know this place pretty well, you just need to tell me the apartment number.\"\n\nC: \"I'ma come outside and watch for you, just look for a green light on one of the door *boop*\"\n\nI wound up finding them rather quickly but man was that annoying and unnecessary. I understand you want to make it easier for me to find you but giving me an apartment number was the best thing you could've done there. Anyone else have a situation like this before?",

        "text": "Hey all, this will be a rant about how today kinda sucked. I'm on mobile so yeah yeah yeah.\n\nTL;DR one guy doesn't pay for what he ordered, another is pissed we don't sell beer and ran out of a wing flavor, and my boyfriend cheated on me. All on the day I worked longer than scheduled. \n\nI got into work a few minutes early and started cleaning dishes. No big fuss since I actually like dealing with dishes most of the time. Everything is going well and after a few hours my manager puts me to work as a server. Now, I worked in a Thai restaurant as a server for a bit so I wasn't too nervous to get started.\n\nFirst table, one dad, two young girls, and a baby. No big, one girl had me running back and forth replacing her drink and was kinda rude but whatever, I'll live.\n\nSecond table, this is where I start getting annoyed. A couple, probably in college, have a seat and I come up to take their drink orders. Come back with drinks and ask for their order. Salad bar along with a large stuffed crust with mushrooms, easy peasy lemon squeezy. I repeat the order back to them and all seems right in the world. After a bit the pizza is ready and I bring it out. The girl gives me an odd look and questions why there is no sausage to which I say I can get it fixed. She decides it's okay so I leave the couple alone. Pay time comes and the guy says they got two drinks and the salad bar. I find the order and give the total, to which the guy says he's not paying for the whole meal. I get the manager and she gives the couple store credit. Yay.\n\nFew tables later, another couple but much older. Same routine, I get their drinks then their order. They want the salad bar and 16 wings divided among two flavors. Got it. After a few minutes my manager says we ran out of one of the flavors so I take a menu back to the couple and explain the situation. Well, the husband wasn't having it tonight. Apparently we screwed him over yesterday by not serving beer (how criminal of us) and today we ran out of the flavor he wants. In a pretty pissed tone he says that they're done eating after they finish the salad. Fine, I take the menu and let them be. But no, that can't be the end of it. The husband gets up and demands to speak to my manager, I point him in the right direction and he goes into a rant about how he's never coming back. Yay. At that point I decide to go to the back and do dishes and check my phone. Welp, apparently my boyfriend has been cheating on me. More goodness for the night.\n\nI finish my shift around 11:40 pm, so about 8 hours in total and I check the schedule to see what times I'm working tomorrow. Lo and behold, my manager told me to come in at 4 today when I was scheduled to come in at 5. \n\nThanks for reading, I know a lot of you have had worse but today still was pretty crappy. I'm ",

        "text": "A monopoly isn't best way to decribe the situation, but it was the best title I could come up with. So here's the deal. Today, I learned that the hotel tycoon in my area has purchased seven hotel properties in town. We're a summer seasonal town, and I make the vast majority of my money in the span of 4-6 months during this tourist season. I listed all of the hotels I could, and came up with a list of 46 hotels/inns. One super rich family who lives here now owns 23 of these properties after purchasing the 7 I mentioned earlier... So literally half.\n\nIn addition to these hotels they also own various restaurants and bars (including a pizza delivery business), and other businesses like mini-golf courses. Because of this, they obviously try to promote their own businesses to their guests as much as possible. It's actually a policy for his front-desk workers to only recommend restaurants that he owns, and doing otherwise is grounds for being fired. My boss had a good relationship with the owner of the recently sold hotels, so he'd carry our menu's and recommend us to his guests. \n\nNaturally there's going to be less recommendations coming our way,  and I'm worried we could see some substantial sales loss this upcoming season. Which, being the pizza delivery guy, is bad news.\n\nSorry for the rant, just felt like sharing. But if anyone's made it this far any advice that I might forward to my boss would be appreciated. Jumping ship to the competition isn't an option for me because they have a reputation of making terrible food, though I've never tried it personally; and my current employers are great. Currently we have a $2 delivery fee to hotels, but I think ditching that fee entirely could help if we do some advertising focusing on \"free delivery\". Compared to the competition we also have the lowest prices on pizza, so I thought it might also be a decent idea because of that fact. I plan on asking my boss how much the delivery fees pull in for him annually, and seeing if removing that fee and backing it up with some advertising could have a positive impact. ",
