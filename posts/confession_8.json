(Currently it’s around my mid calves, I just like it really long lol.) Now when you have hair this long you tend to wear it in a bun more often than not and since it’s so long and thick the bun is absolutely massive. So you can store small objects in there and no one will ever check because why the fuck would you ever look in someone’s hair for anything? I started smoking weed in my senior year of high school at like 18. (I have the medical card now but got it at like 21). So in order to hide the fact that I had it, I would hide it in my bun until I got to a place I could stash it. Multiple friends got busted for having/smoking weed but I never did because no one ever checked my bun because why would you ever check someone’s bun for a bag of weed?",

At first, I didn't really think of taking her project but then temptation took the best of me, and so, I wrote MY name on the project so it would seem like I was the one who did it. \n\nMy other seatmates even helped me with it.  Anyway I ended up submitting it. \n\nMy friend (who's project I just submitted and credited myself,) was present the next day and she was being so sweet to me like usual. \n\nAnd I feel so bad for her I told her about the project that was due, and she said  \"yeah, well, my friend already submitted it yesterday on behalf of me\" \n\nIt's been almost half a month now since that happened and I can't help but feel guilt eating me alive. \n\nI love her so much and I can't loose that friend of mine.",

        "text": "Part of me wants to justify my selfishness by saying that you wouldn’t understand *why* I do weed. It’s easy to assume people can easily stop getting high without knowing where their mental state is at, but the truth is that I’m purely doing weed for recreational reasons and I might hurt myself and my girlfriend as a result. \n\nRecently my girlfriend and I accomplished our dream of moving into an apartment. Everything has been great except for the fact that she makes significantly more than me and so we rely heavily on her salary whenever we wanna do anything recreational or have a date night. This has always been a source of stress and shame for me –a little bit of machismo, but I wanna be able to provide for the woman I love–, so I’ve been applying everywhere trying to get a better paying job to better sustain us. \n\nI was recently made a offer with a company that also I would enjoy, but in while this process has been going on I’ve continuously been using Delta 8 and alternative marijuana during the job search (again, not trying to justify, but with the knowledge of my girlfriend). Now, I don’t know for certain if they test or not but just the idea that I consciously sabotaged myself and my girlfriend makes me feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world. \n\nI know I could probably use synthetic pee and that my stressing out about the possibility of being tested may be much ado about nothing, but I just feel like I’ve ruined a great opportunity for no reason other than not having self control.",

        "text": "Antes de empezar quiero que sepan que esto es completamente real salvó que cambie uno que otro nombre de los involucrados para mantener secreta mi identidad. A su vez está es solo la parte introductoria y lo más importante recién viene en la siguiente parte.\n\nBueno, para empezar quien escribe es alguien de 17 años apunto de cumplir los 18 y los sentimientos que tengo en la actualidad me tienen muy confundido y algo triste, les cuento todo esto empieza cuando apenas entraba al 4to grado de primaria y pues me encontré con los que ya eran mis amigos de siempre, durante los 2 años anteriores que estuve en esa escuela. Pero ese año había una diferencia pues una amiga de mi madre (Griselda) iba a matricular a sus hijos (uno más grande que yo y otra más o menos de mi edad), pero lo más importante de esta parte es que recuerden a la hija de la amiga de mi madre (Katia), pues ella aparentaba más edad que el resto de chicos en clase y con ella ingresaba su mejor amiga (Camila) que era todo lo contrario pues tenía una apariencia de una niña que aparentaba quizá unos 7 años de los 9 que en realidad tenía. Cosa que no era tan extraño al menos para mí pues a decir verdad yo también aparentaba 7 (pues era el menor de la clase y siempre era un poco más chico), en fin, cuando ví a Camila por primera vez me pareció muy linda, pero nada más osea simplemente como una niña linda. Por cosas del destino recuerdo que mis amigos se empezaron a juntar con otro chico nuevo (Miguel) y me dejaron algo de lado durante los primeros días de clases (en lo personal Miguel me parecia un niño muy mimado y como que no me caía mucho) y para no estar solo empecé a hablar también con otros chicos, dentro de ellos Katia que se me acercó y empezamos a hablar, como podrán adivinar ambos nos caímos muy bien y como era algo obvio Camila también se volvió una gran amiga, claramente mis amigos me empezaron a molestar por qué me juntaba con las nuevas y otras cosas que ya se podrán imaginar por la edad que teníamos en ese momento, para no alargar mucho esto, nos volvimos muy buenos amigos y es más hasta Miguel me empezó a caer mejor, bueno ya a esas alturas Miguel decía que estaba enamorado de Camila y pues Camila lo ignoraba un poco porque tenía un punto de vista parecido al que yo tenía sobre el y entre esas cosas termino el 4to grado, en dónde a mi también Camila me parecía \"linda\". Empezó 5to y había rumores de que yo le gustaba a Camila, los cuales obvio me halagaban mucho, pero preferí no mostrar ese sentir porque en caso no sean ciertos no quería quedar como tonto ante ella. Aunque más tarde Katia me confirmó la veracidad de ese rumor (por cierto durante el 4to grado hubo un punto dónde me molestaban demasiado y Katia me defendía porque al aparentar más edad imponía respeto entre los otros niños y gracias a eso ya no me molestaba nadie y todo el salón se llevaba de maravilla). Además si mostraba ese sentir obviamente me volverían a molestar y yo no quería eso. Al igual que en el 4to grado  todo transcurrió normal, bueno hasta las fiestas de navidad, pues ya desde el 4to grado jugábamos al amigo secreto, ya saben dónde le das regalos a alguien y así, pues a mí me tocó regalarle a Camila, ella a Miguel y Miguel a mi, pero porque uno de los niños más malcriados del salón saco la relación que guardaba el maestro de quién regalaba a quien todos nos enteramos quien nos regalaba y a quien regalabamos, el profesor algo enfadado volvió a realizar el sorteo donde está vez yo regalaba a Camila y Camila me regalaba a mi, pues señales que creo que el destino ya mandaba desde ahí, en fin, en 5to grado volvió a ocurrir lo mismo y en 6to también osea que los 2 nos regalamos algo durante 3 años por navidad, estando en 6to me di cuenta que Camila ya no solo me parecía linda sino que pues tenía una manera distinta de verla.Bueno,Griselda (amiga de mi madre) se peleó con mi mamá y pues la amistad con Katia media que también se quebró aunque a esa edad el enfado solo dura unos cuantos días y después de que Katia me volviera a hablar me dijo algo que realmente me afectó y no pensé que sería así, pues me dijo que a Camila le empezó a gustar Miguel y adivinaran que Miguel al escuchar el rumor saltaba de un pie, obviamente no me mostré afectado porque el sentimiento que yo tenía hacia Camila solo lo sabía doky (mi perro) y yo. Y no quería que nadie más lo sepa por miedo a las burlas y eso. 3 meses antes de terminar el 6to grado Katia me dijo algo que hasta ahora retumba en mi mente: a Camila le gustas tu y lo de Miguel solo fue temporal porque tú nunca dijiste nada y aunque tú no lo admitas se que a ti te gusta Camila y estoy seguro que sustedes dos terminarán justos, se casarán y tendrán 2 hijos, esto lo decreto y estoy segura que así será dijo como haciendo un ritual. Quería ocultar mi cara de felicidad y pues me rei como haciendo burla de ella, ese año viví muchas cosas felices con mis compañeros con cada uno sin excepción, aunque más con (Eduardo, Miguel, Gabriel, armado, Camila, Katia y Stephanie). Ya para terminar la primaria realizamos un baile en dónde un profesor nos iba a enseñar una coreografía de un vals para ese día, obviamente y como el destino juega así me tocó con Camila y a Miguel le tocó con otra niña, lo cuál lo puso muy celoso, pero a diferencia de mi el si lo mostraba y hasta se puso a llorar porque el quería bailar con Camila por suerte el profesor no acepto su majaderia y le dijo: lo ordene así y se queda a así, llegó el gran día del baile y nuestras madres tanto míos como de Camila estaban emocionadas, por cierto mi madre se hizo buena amiga de la madre de Camila (Nazareth), nos tomaron como un millón de fotos y así, esa noche la recuerdo hasta la actualidad pues es un recuerdo feliz y cuando me siento abatido recuerda esa noche para que se me pase. Y cuando los 7 amigos con los que viví lo mejor de ese año estábamos a punto de decirnos adiós, nuestros padres nos detuvieron para decirnos que nos pondrían en la misma secundaria, excepto a Miguel que se iba a mudar a otra ciudad.\n\nPosdata: Bueno haré una segunda parte donde contaré lo que realmente me importa, esto solo era como para que tengan el contexto más claro, porque en esta parte no pasa realmente nada importante, pero si me olvidé de algo se los aclararé en la siguiente en la que realmente está lo principal de mi historia. Gracias por llegar hasta aquí 😃",

        "text": "My bad if it isn't the right sub to post this confession, if it's not, mods feel free to take it down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened about 7 - 8 years ago when I (M) was in HS and I'm posting on here to get it off my chest because of how it's been plaguing me mentally for the 7 - 8 years. I'm sharing this on here so I can find some peace and let go of it for good. (I'll spare the details of the honeymoon phase and move directly to the main point.)\n\nI had my first girlfriend (let's call her Amy) in the 10th grade and like every teen, I was over the moon because we had been great friends and part of the same group. While everything was going fairly well, a few months later a bunch of other \"friends\" got involved in the relationship with comments, stories, and other stuff leading to Amy calling it quits. Just before it was called off, a few rumors involving me started going around which sealed the deal for Amy and it hurt more cause I was literally in between a rock and a hard place. \n\nDuring our time together, I was told by a mutual friend that another girl (let's call her Ruby) liked me, but I wanted nothing to do with any of it, which I made clear to both of em. A little background on Ruby is that she had quite a reputation around school for her time spent with guys along with her actions.\n\nNow, seeing that everything had ended and Amy wanted nothing to do with me, my teenage brain couldn't process this leading to a stupid, yet eye-opening decision. It went like so, Ruby and I started talking in class on the day of an exam, we connected, and one thing lead to another by lunch we were in an empty class on second base. She still had feelings for me at this point.\n\nNow, I regretted that stupid decision as it happened and every day since. As anyone would, we both agreed that this couldn't be known to anyone else, but lo and behold, she told everyone a while later leading to me being put into complete exile for 6 months at school. I was blamed for the entire situation taking place and for months had to hear vile taunts from others like names, physical gestures, emotional attacks, etc. This led to me sitting in empty classrooms every day at lunch, avoiding people, and contemplating life in general, but I was lucky enough to stay under the radar when it came to faculty not finding out about this because that would've been a whole different story.\n\nHowever, as painful as the entire ordeal was, I was able to identify who the real \"friends\" in my circle were and how they \"stuck around to support me\" like they always said. It really helped open up my mind to the many arses of the world, how to deal with them, and growing as a person. \n\nThe entire thing has plagued my mind every day since it happened and it boxed me in for a very very long time, but even as a type this I can feel a load being lifted off my shoulders and chest. Again, my bad if this isn't supposed to be on this sub but I really needed to get this off my mind and move on for the sake of sanity. I'll regret a lot of it for the rest of my life but I've realized that despite whatever I thought back then, those people mean nothing to me and have absolutely no power when it comes to me moving forward.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading through.",

And when I realised afterwards that this person would be out of my life forever I wasn’t even upset one bit.

Even when people tried to reach out or reconnect I simply ignored them. I can completely cut anyone out of my life over the smallest most insignificant things and no matter how close I was with them it never upsets me. Is anyone else like this?

Now because I'm easily bored, everytime I ran out of things to do and checked to see if he was inside, I'd lock him inside because I thought it was funny. To get away, he used to have to climb out the window, and I used to chuckle as I saw him do it. If he had irritated me after arguing, I would likewise do it. He eventually discovered that it was best to keep the key out of my reach.",

They listen to random calls for quality assurance.
