I looked up the relevant scientific research and was surprised to find [a substantial amount of studies on the topic](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/obr.12795), but the research is still very new, a little more than a decade old. More research is needed, and my thesis will be an original (but small) contribution to that.\n\nI've now come to the point of having to collect data, and this community, among others, is a very good candidate for this type of study, as most people here are most likely doing some form of regular exercise.\n\nThat is why I'm very thankful for the opportunity to share this with you guys, and I hope that you also appreciate the opportunity of contributing to my little contribution to scientific research on the topic.\n\nThe survey is short and simple and only takes about 5 minutes to complete.

They gave out a lot of good information, that most people in BB already know (eat right, eat often, train hard, rest\/recover, track everything, etc.).\n\nIt was cool that they were taking lots of questions, but I felt they didn't cover a lot of topics because of it, for instance Hany recommended starting the day with \\~20 minutes of fasted cardio, then there were 40 minutes of questions about fasted cardio that followed. The entire day was like this.\n\nIt was definitely inspiring to see the big man in person and to hear how Hany and Cbum collaborate, but a lot of the info was body building 101, which is still valuable to a lot of people new to the sport.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1677430443.0},{"title":"26, 5\u201911. 205lbs. 4 weeks out.
