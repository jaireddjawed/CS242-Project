Alexievich adds a page or two of her own thoughts to each chapter but strictly speaking it could have been left out. \n\nShe won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2015 for \"for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time.\" Apparently all her books follow this format.\n\nHowever:\n\n&gt;She has been described as the first journalist to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.[31] She herself rejects the notion that she is a journalist, and, in fact, what appears in her books as witnesses, are fiction and are changed between different editions of the same book.[32]\n\nThis seems dishonest. Either these are true stories from the people who lived them or they're not. And if they're not, then it shouldn't be presented as history, but as fiction. But if they're history, should they be awarded a literature prize? ",
