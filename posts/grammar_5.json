I became so frustrated and confused that I decided not to speak at all. I can't even have normal conversations without stumbling over my words.

        "text": "This is just a curiosity, but sometimes people write messages and capitalize what seems to be random words in the middle of sentences. The words are only common nouns, not proper nouns. It has been becoming a more common occurrence, although that may just be personal awareness and seeing it in others' messages. Sometimes it may only be a single word in the middle of a sentence. Other times it could be several words.\n\nMaybe it's just people using their phones and not bothering to undo possible auto-capitalizations, like in cases when a word was originally the first one in a sentence. However, that would not explain the times that multiple common nouns are capitalized in the middle of sentences.\n\nI wish I had a good example of this, although I remember one post on this site a while back that was littered with randomly capitalized common nouns and people were responding to their post, some of them a bit rude about it, asking if the person was having a brain aneurysm and needed medical attention. I looked at the individual's other posts and it appeared that English may not have been their first language. Still, it would seem odd that even with English as a secondary language that someone would start capitalizing multiple common nouns at random intervals in sentences.\n\nAgain, this is just a curiosity, nothing to think too much about. It's not a big deal given the context of where this has been happening, mainly on Reddit. It doesn't bother me, I just ignore it. Of course, it would make sense if it bothers anybody that has noticed it, if anybody else has noticed it.\n\nI know this may seem like a random post, if I'm posting this in the wrong sub, that's okay, I can go somewhere else with it. I'm just curious if anybody else has noticed the common noun capitalizations and any thoughts on it.\n\nThanks!",

Both events are placed in the in the future on the timeline, so why aren't they both in future tense?\"\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but last time I checked, \"I am eating\" is present continuous. So, is it future tense because it talks about the future (and if so, then is present perfect past tense), or is it present continuous (my argument) because it is formed using (present tense of to be) + present participle (how present continuous tenses are formed)?",

The word \"about\" here is a preposition that brings more context to the generic word \"work\", which without context could mean working at anything, no matter how good, bad, or ugly. Compare the phrase \"The painting is ugly.\" with \"The painting in the living room is ugly.\" Among friends, you can assume that they will understand which painting you mean. There is one painting of a dead horse that is clearly ugly. But in mixed company, without the clear context, it's not difficult for somone in the spirit of unfettered competitiveness to play on the missing context and infer that you are complaining about the painting on the refridgerator by the host's son. By using a prepositional phrase \"on the refridgerator\", you are holding the context down. There are many ways to hold down context, but prepositions are one of them.",

        "text": "And this appears to have, you know, a beneficial effect in terms of **jog**ging the brain out of bad patterns.\n\nContext:\n\n[https://bigthink.com/health/how-do-psychedelics-work/](https://bigthink.com/health/how-do-psychedelics-work/)\n\nSo what is that? Well, it's a tightly linked set of structures connecting the prefrontal cortex to the posterior cingulate cortex, to the deeper older centers of emotion and memory. It appears to be involved in things like self-reflection, theory of mind, the ability to impute mental states to others, mental time travel, the ability to project forward in time and back, which is central to creating an identity, right? You don't have an identity without a memory and the so-called autobiographical memory, the function by which we construct the story of who we are by taking the things that happened to us and folding them into that narrative. And that appears to take place in the posterior cingulate cortex. So, you know, to the extent the ego can be said to have a location in the brain it appears to be this, the default mode network. It's active when you're doing nothing. When your mind is wandering. It can be very self-critical, it's where self-talk takes place. And that goes quiet. And when that goes quiet, the brain is sort of as one of the neuroscientists put it, let off the leash, because those ego functions, that self idea is a regulator of all mental activity and kind of, you know, the brain is a hierarchical system and the default mode network appears to be at the top. It's kind of the orchestra conductor or corporate executive. And you take that out of the picture, and suddenly you have this uprising from other parts of the brain and you have networks that don't ordinarily communicate with one another suddenly striking up conversations. So you might have the visual cortex talking to the auditory system, and suddenly you're seeing music, or it becomes palpable. You can feel it or smell it and, you know, synesthesia. So you have this temporary rewiring of the brain, in the absence of the control of the regulator. And this appears to have, you know, a beneficial effect in terms of **jog**ging the brain out of bad patterns.",
