        "text": "Hi, all!\n\nI'm currently a third-year medical student, and I'm having a lot of difficulting determining whether to pursue general surgery or internal medicine, with the end goal being either cardiothoracic surgery or interventional cardiology. I'm leaning toward the internal medicine approach because of the brutality of surgical residency. That's not to say that I'm not willing to do general surgery, per se. I'm just waiting to do a cardiothoracic surgery elective to gauge how much I like it before deciding. \n\nHere's my dilemma: Our school administration has asked us to pick a specialty to do an AI. I'm unsure which specialty I should do it in, internal medicine or general surgery. Whichever I pick, I'll have a hardtime switching if I change my mind. In other words, if I decide to do surgery, I may be stuck with an internal medicine AI and vice versa. \n\nOur clinical grade designations are honors, pass, and fail; I honored every clerkship except internal medicine.  In consideration of this, my current line of thought is to do an AI in internal medicine because it was the only course I didn't honor. In the case that I want to apply surgery after my cardiothoracic surgery elective, I'll just line up a bunch of surgery electives and ask for letters that way. My only concern is that will a lack of a surgery AI be a redflag for surgery programs?",

The only thing is I come from a jewish background and there definitely are not a lot of jews here around my age, if any. I went back east for a bit recently and it made me have some envy of friends going to schools in NY and DC. I'm not even that religious, but with Purim just passing and Passover coming up next month it feels kinda lonely.

Id spent weeks stress vomiting and was so glad it was over I shot finger guns at my proctor and told him I hoped I would never see him again.  He looked at me like I'd lost my shit and now I really hope I dont see him again. \n\n2. Surgery rotation.  I walk into the OR and toss my gloves and gown onto the table.  No resident or intern from my team to be found.  The fellow comes up to me and goes \"where's your team?! They should be sending a resident to every single case.\"  I stare blankly at him because I ain't no snitch.  He stares at me.  I stare at him.  I then say \"look, Im just the med student.  People say jump, I ask how high.\"  He says he respects that and walks away. \n\n3. OBGYN.  I am in the OR at a C section with an attending and a resident.  They are chatting about aging as I retract the bladder.  I say \"I feel you, when I started med school I was young and fresh faced.  Now people look at me and say 'somebody come get your grandma.'\"  Resident does not laugh.  Attending does not laugh.  I laugh because I think it is funny.\n\n4. Peds.  I am in a didactics session with 2 other med students and the attending is going on a long winded explanation about febrile seizures.  I am nodding and smiling but realized I have lost control of the conversation and have no idea what is going on.  He then looks directly at me and asks \"and so what do you tell the mother?\"  I have no idea what he is talking about.  I pause a moment and then outright ask what he's talking about.  The attending laughs at me but I can see the pain in his eyes.\n\n5. Psych.  I go see a patient with my attending.  Super serious dude, very intimidating.  We finish up and go to a conference room to chat.  I am already on edge because my manic patient has been chasing me around the unit yelling at me all morning.  He asks what I think of the new patient and if I think they're psychotic.  I start vocally reasoning through the ambiguity of the situation.  He says \"now that you've said all that, answer the question.  Psychotic or not psychotic?\"  He looks through my soul with his piercing eyes and my aura withers under his stare.  My mind races and instead of answering the question I look straight into his eyes as I wipe my hands on my scrub pants and say \"Dr. Attending, my palms are sweaty.\" He responds \"your palms dont need to be sweaty, just answer the question.\" I say psychotic.  He says not psychotic. \n\nI feel like this is going to get worse before it gets better lmao",

(I already know many programs treat them as mini-residency interviews). They said based on their experience as well as advice they received that if accepted to two programs for the same time slot, and you decline one, the prospect of residency at the program you declined in nil. Declining is, how they phrased it, \"burning bridges.\" Is this true?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy application is a competitive one, (not going in detail but honors and research in ortho and my own not ortho).

In the meantime, some guy she knows claims that he barely studies, yet gets the highest grades on the exams. \n\nRecently, she found out that he was getting all of the tests from an older student in M2 and has been getting by with the materials they provide him, which is sometimes identical to the exam material. Apparently a few people in the class are doing this. \n\nI was sick and tired of people cheating in college, and I assumed the MCAT would weed out cheaters, but I guess not. Does this still happen in medical school? With Step 1 being pass/fail now, how is that even fair?? It’s infuriating.",

I’ve been well managed on meds, and even worked 2+ years of shift work / ER overnights as a scribe without any narcolepsy related issues. \n\nMy sleep doctor doesn’t seem to care whether I disclose this information or not. I am VERY concerned that disclosing this as a “disability” will end up biting me in the ass down the line. Although I completed my undergrad undiagnosed, I did a post bacc and took the MCAT following my diagnosis (medicated &amp; performed well) so the meds clearly manage my symptoms and I’m not worried about needing any accommodations in school. \n\nDrug testing also plays a role - I’ll obviously test positive for stimulants. But from my understanding, as long as I have a prescription it doesn’t matter, and the school doesn’t get to ask why I’m on certain medications. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation / have any advice?

It's great an I'm enjoying it, but I'm seriously underperforming. \n\nI got into my school via an assurance program with a 500 MCAT. I'm not sure how I even got that score considering my studying amounted to just doing a Kaplan practice test and then the first AAMC FL. Then I spent the summer coming up with study methods I thought would work for me. I set up my anki in a way that I believed would be ideal. I found good third party resources that I liked (nothing out of the ordinary, FA/Bootcamp/BB, Amboss for practice questions and additional info) The semester started and I was doing pretty well, got a 90% overall in my public health course. Next class was biochem and anatomy, and immediately my study habits fell apart. I barely barely passed this course (a rounded up 69.7 to pass me). Then my next course was cardio/pulmonary/renal and I failed it by 2%. After that was GI and endocrin, and failed it by 5%. I'm currently in neuro and on track to actually pass this one, but not by a good margin. I can't fail this one or I repeat the year, I already have to remediate the two failures. \n\nI just cannot seem to focus. I put my phone away and open up my materials and then 5 minutes later I'm doing something else. I start watching a lecture or bootcamp video and then suddenly I'm on youtube. I get through like 4 practice questions an hour. I learn pretty quickly, and I *know* I can do better cause I'm getting close without doing much at all. I just can't seem to actually get myself to sit down and work for any serious amount of time. \n\nAny of you go through something like this? What did you do to resolve it? Thanks.",

        "text": "This is basically a “is the extra prestige worth the sacrifice” question. Trying to decide where I want to go for school. \n\nI have three schools in the running, and I think all offer great educations from what I’ve learned (access to several facilities, exposure to lots of specialties, opportunities for mentorship and research, diverse patient populations, at least one or more flagship facilities, like a Level 1 trauma center or hospital that sees International patients/rare cases). \n\nOne is a top 15 according to most recent US News. Other two are top 30.\n\nSome things I’m thinking about:\n\nEducation/residency opportunities\n\n1. Top 15’s flagship hospital is definitely the most renowned of my options. So would be cool to train there as a med student/might help me in residency apps\n\n2. Not sure what I want to go to residency for. I like primary care, but not 100% dedicated to it either, so there’s a chance I might want something more competitive?\n\n3. If it matters for residency prospects, (I’d be surprised if it did) I went to a top 5 undergrad \n\n4. None of these schools are too high stress. All are P/F, do Friday exams and culturally seem like they want students to be happy/have a life outside school\n\n5. Have anecdotally heard that Top 15 curriculum style is conducive to STEP prep but idk how true that is.\n\n\nCost\n\n1. Not sure about tuition/cost of attendance yet—so far I have a partial scholarship to one Top 30, but Top 15 may significantly waive tuition depending on financial aid. If they do, it would be cheapest, if they don’t it’ll be the most expensive I think \n\n2. Generally, I think Top 15 has more resources and offers more free support (e.g., free STEP prep materials). \n\n3. Housing options are not good for Top 15 (either kinda crappy or extremely expensive). At Top 30s I can afford to live more comfortably - have a clean homey space that I love coming back to, actually have space to host/hang out with friends where I live, limit sharing of kitchens &amp; bathrooms w/ random people (I am extremely clean lol), affordably access amenities like a gym or laundry. Which I actually value so much in my day to day. I could try to recreate that at Top 15 but it would take probably 2x the rent money.\n\n\nQuality of life\n\n1. Weather at Top 15 is kinda miserable for a lot of the year; Weather at Top 30s is consistently nice.\n\n2. I’ve actually lived in the same city as the Top 15 school, and have found it kinda draining/depressing for the reasons above, and a little lonely (but working on that, I have more friends there now)\n\n3. I think in terms of community (also very important to me) I could prob find good community at any of them, either within school or from friends in the area. \n\n\nTL;DR - I think I’d enjoy my day to day life more at either of the less prestigious schools, bc of a lot of lifestyle factors. Is the extra prestige of a Top 15 school above a Top 30 (when both have solid facilities, a breadth of training opportunities, and at least some name/brand recognition) worth sacrificing my quality of life?",

Programs do care about the fact that ur couple matching. Mention it everywhere that ur couple match ie PS, IV, Letters, etc. \n\nIt's tough but knowing ur partner is besides you makes it a whole lot easier and worthwhile.

We need to be active and vocal and ACEP doesn’t have any inclination to do either.\n\nThat all being said, as someone who has *wanted* to go into EM since medical school, residency is amazing. I genuinely enjoy it and the range of patients seen. Procedures are absolutely amazing and enjoyable, I have incredible faculty and co-residents who are supportive and make it a joy to work. Can I speak to the experience of every program out there? No, and I know there’s some incredibly garbage ones. But I just wanted to let EM-bound students know, hey, there are residents here that are genuinely happy, we exist; wouldn’t mind more money, but we exist.

        "text": "Please let this be a warning to all medical students planning to SOAP into a HCA residency. I am a PGY-3 EM resident at a HCA EM program. My experience at this program has been the absolute worst and one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. I have suffered through for 3 years because I had no other options after 400k+ student loans and a family to support.\n\nSpeaking with friends at other HCA programs few things are recurring themes, these including them continuously adding on scut work and shifts for residents to milk every dollar then can, having no organization or constant leadership for programs, constantly having \"away rotations\" to try to meet bare minimums for procedures (many of my colleagues have not completed all required procedures including lumbar punctures, deliveries, trauma resuscitations, etc.). We have constantly rotating \"faculty\", many of whom have no interest in residents or teaching and are just here for a quick locums gig. I honestly feel totally unprepared to even begin practicing on my own.\n\nWe are constantly getting new requirements to meet certain metrics from the HCA overlords and pressure on shift from malignant attendings to meet them. There is hardly every any organized didactics and forget about teaching on shift you will be just trying to meet the endless metrics and keep the patients moving. It it clear that all HCA wants to do is exploit cheap labor and increase their bottom line and your training as a emergency medicine resident is not even be a priority. To top it all of many of us are still struggling to find jobs, sure there are some openings in rural wherever but none of us have signed in a desirable location, and over half of use are still looking for a job. We have no support or connections to help use through the job process. There are so many better options than to SOAP into a HCA EM residency and I just felt the need to get this off my chest and warn others out there who may be considering it.\n\nTLDR; Unless you want to suffer through 3 years of misery, and not have any job prospects in 3/4 years, DO NOT SOAP into a HCA EM residency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/11qs0te/soap\\_warning\\_em\\_hca\\_residency/](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/11qs0te/soap_warning_em_hca_residency/)",

        "text": "Hey guys, I'm an M3 who's finished core rotations, and I just can't seem to figure out what I want. I've been wavering between OB/GYN and IM and can't seem to make up my mind. How did you guys decide? Any regrets in your decisions? \n\nThese are some pros and cons I could think of for each--and please correct me if I am misguided in any of these! \n\nOB/GYN Pros:  \n\\- Love the combo of clinic and OR, great patient population in all stages of life, each day will be different and unpredictable; longitudinal care   \n\\- Pelvic anatomy is great -- interesting and understandable, and I can see my future self enjoying doing surgeries   \n\\- Seeing babies born was one of the happiest moments of my life this past year  \n\\- I enjoy being in the OR and like the variety of procedures that are done  \n\\- All the sub-specialties seem interesting to me, and I'm drawn to papers that talk about OB/GYN stuff  \n\\- Preventive care &amp; population health are a big focus in this specialty   \nCons:  \n\\- Lower salary and very high malpractice insurance, high risk of being sued  \n\\- Something felt off about the culture, can't say exactly what; most people were nice, but I was always questioning my self-worth on this rotation (unlike other ones where I was my usual self)  \n\\- Worried that the set of diagnoses is limited, that I won't really be as much of a 'thinker' or diagnostician as I would be on IM--and I do enjoy figuring things out. OB/GYN is said to be more of a 'doing' specialty. Will I get bored of seeing the same stuff after a couple years? I've heard MFM is great for 'thinkers', but I need to know more about it. Do MFMs still get to be in the OR at all?  \n\\- Risk of burnout with a poor lifestyle, may not have time for family or my own children   \n\n\nIM Pros:  \n\\- Will see a wide variety of diseases and get to heal patients from all walks of life, longitudinal care in the outpatient setting   \n\\- Can do procedures, especially in sub-specialties like GI and cardio, and can do LP, paracentesis, etc, and still get hands-on experience, even if I'm not in the OR   \n\\- Can do a lot of problem-solving as I reach the DDx  \n\\- Can sub-specialize and be on consult services or do outpatient medicine, if I don't like being a general hospitalist; I think cardio and heme-onc are pretty cool and I might find a way to be happy doing one of those things.   \n\\- Much better salary than OB/GYN particularly if you sub specialize, lower risk of getting sued; will probably have a better lifestyle   \n\\- My overbearing parent wants me to choose IM, and choosing it would make them happy enough to stop nagging  \nCons:  \n\\- Won't be in the OR ever again (Maybe I could live with that...but maybe I'll regret it and realize that I love and belong in the OR? Who knows!?)   \n\\- I don't really like the idea of charting and typing notes all day long... Rounding and charting day after day seems tedious. I like the acuity of care in the hospital setting, but it got monotonous.   \n\\- Don't really get the instant gratification that you fixed/did something, particularly in the outpatient setting (And this is how preventive care works--it's a long game, but worth it! But in a mixed specialty, there are still some elements where you do get that instant gratification.) \n\nThis is where I'm at, and I don't know what to do. :-(   \nPlease help!",
