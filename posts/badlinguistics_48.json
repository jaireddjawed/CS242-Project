        "text": "*Copy pasted from Facebook and names will be replaced by Bob and Fred. The post was originally about which Vietnamese Nôm characters represented \"dấu hiệu\" (traces, marks, signs). The single Nôm character below is* [足+斗] *(semantic + phonetic). The problem is that the phonetic component's initial consonant is* **đ** (đấu) *while the character itself represents* **d**ấu.\n\n\n**Enjoy!**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n**Fred**: I don't see how 𧿫 can produce the sound of \"dấu\"\n____________________________\n\n**Bob**: Mind you not too long ago the letter 'd' in Quốc ngữ was pronounced /ð/ ('th' in then) in the Hanoi dialect. A lot of foreigners who cannot produce the /ð/ sound replace it with /d/ or an equivalent sound such as how many Vietnamese pronounce English d like Vietnamese đ.. This is my theory anyway.\n________________________\n**Fred**: nah, &lt;insert name&gt; and &lt;insert name&gt; already said that English \"d\" pronunciation is slightly different from Vietnames \"đ\". But according to you then should we pronounce do as ðo? Sorry, but I don't believe this theory as I can speak fluent Cochinchinese unless you can provide me with source stated d was originally written as ð and pronounced as d. And thn not long ago is how long?\n____________________________\n**Bob**: I am very well aware of the difference between English's 'd' and Vietnamese 'd' and 'đ'. How we pronounce things changes with time. My source is Kenneth Gregerson's 1981 publication called \"A Study of Middle Vietnamese Phonology\" in which he indicates that the Quốc ngữ 'd' was chosen as such due to the (at the time) Hanoi pronunciation as /ð/ and the fact that Iberian Spanish 'd' was also pronounced as /ð/. Can you guess where nh- or gh-/ngh- comes from? It's pretty irrelevant whether or not you speak the language of today or believe it because I'd trust the word of a linguist over anyone else. Sorry!\n\nDo a little research and it will make sense. I'm not a big fan of \"Cochinchinese\" as that wields a very colonial connotation. Alexandre de Rhodes lived mostly in the 1600s. That's when his works came about during the period just prior to Modern Vietnamese. A lot can change in the span of 400 years... How would you explain the fact the 'd' is now /z/ in NV and /j/ in NC/CV/SV?\n________________________\n**Fred**: huh? what did Iberian Spanish language doing here? Vietnamese latin script was developed by using Portuguese alphabets. And sorry again, recent research in Hanoi made very sense to me and it is totally contrary to this so-called's Alexandre de Rhodes' book. Someone was born in Europe and claim he was done with some research o Asian using his European sources.\n____________________________\n**Bob**: Now you're just being ignorant. You dismiss a linguist purely on the basis that he's European? Who do you think came up with the very plausible and most widely accepted theory of tonogenesis? Anyone with the tiniest smidgen of knowledge regarding the orthographies of Western Europe can show you that this is not the case. In fact the Vietnamese script of today is the result of a smattering of different conventions taken across from several languages:\n\n• d- (as I've mentioned already) was chosen to represent the d of Hanoi in the 1600s /ð/ and was influenced by Iberian Spanish's very own spelling of the same sound.\n• nh- is very easily and distinguishably Portuguese in its representation of /ɲ/.\n• gh- and ngh- are yet again from another spelling system, this time it's Italian's. \n• đ- was taken from the Germanic languages but used to represent a sound that was not present in European languages. The bar represents the fact that the sound requires you to raise your lips to the palate of your mouth and immediately removing it, without in any way touching the teeth\n\nFor the record I am Vietnamese but can speak English more fluently than many native speakers of this wonderful tongue. Alas! I am not English ergo my views should not count, right? As for that \"research in Hanoi\" you mention, I'd like to see it for myself please. Link?\n________________________\n**Fred**: huh, d is now pronounced as \"z\" O_O. So Vietnam doesn't have linguists? only Europe have it?\nJust answer me only one question, is 斗 originally pronounced as dẩu and 頭 dầu? And what is the different between ð and đ? Thank you very much in advance for explanation, Mr. Linguist.\n____________________________\n**Bob**: If you can speak Vietnamese then you should bloody well know that the letter 'd' is pronounced /z/ in NV (Hanoi) and /j/ in NC/CV/SV. Where did I mention anything about Vietnam not having linguists? I was speaking out against the fact that you were dismissing a linguist solely because he was \"European\" and ergo \"is not a credible source\" when it comes to the study of the Vietnamese language.\n\n斗 is rendered as đẩu/đấu in modern Vietnamese and in most Chinese languages + Japanese and Korean have d/t initials. So how come that one particular character for dấu (/z/ or /j/) uses a phonetic with a đ (/ɗ/ or according to others /ʔd/.) initial? According to 'A Study of Middle Vietnamese Phonology' (Gregerson, 1981) during the 1600s the letter represented orthographically as d was pronounced /ð/ in Hanoi. A lot of foreigners (especially from Vietnam) who cannot produce that sound will approximate it as English d or even Vietnamese đ. In Spanish d is either /d/ or /ð/. As such it's not that much of a stretch to think that some Vietnamese people during the 17th century approximated /ð/ as /d/, /ɗ/ or /ʔd/ leading to some interchangeable usage of d/đ.\n\nThe modern Vietnamese spelling system is a culmination of centuries worth of gradual (and at times chaotic) development. It's not perfect and in fact has a lot of oddities and inconsistencies. In most modern Chinese languages with the inclusion of Japanese and Korean, a lot of morphemes that had /j/ initials in Middle Chinese retain them. For example:\n\n夜 meaning 'night, evening, dark' is:\n\nMiddle Chinese: *ya\nMandarin: ye4\nCantonese: ye6\nJapanese: (や) ya\nKorean: (야) ya\nVietnamese: dạ &lt;--- notice how it's d, why is that so? \n\nHow about we explore v for a moment? According to Vietnamese linguist (you happy?) Phạm Văn Bân the letter v was pronounced (/β/) during Middle Vietnamese which is what other linguists claim too. The word 'bú' (to suck, suckle) and 'vú' (breast) derive from the same root. However, the letter v is also used to represent /w/ in Middle Vietnamese. For example the word hoàng (黄) is nativised as vàng (then pronounced as wàng). \n\nAnother example is vĩnh viễn (永遠) which was pronounced wĩnh yiễn. Wait what? Why does v also represent /j/? Oh yeah how could I forget Việt Nam (越南)? *Hjuaet in Middle Chinese, Yuenan (Mandarin), Yuetnam (Cantonese) but Weolnam (Korean Hanja reading). Thái-dương (太陽) = taiyang (Mandarin), taaiyoeng (Cantonese) たいよう/taiyō (Japanese), 태양/taeyang (Korean). Notice the /j/ sounds.\n\nOr how about gi-? In Middle Vietnamese it was said to be /kj/ but is now /z/ in NV but /j/ in SV.\n\nSo to summarise: \n\ngi &lt;--- represented /kj/ and became /z/ + /j/... \nv &lt;--- represented /w/ + /j/ + /β/ and became /v/ + /j/...\nb &lt;--- represented /p/ and became /ɓ/...\nd &lt;--- represented /ð/ + /j/ but became /z/ and /j/...\n\nð represents the sound 'th' in words like 'then' and 'there' while đ is just the modern Vietnamese /ɗ/ or according to others /ʔd/.\n\nP.S: I don't claim to be a linguist. I'm just a linguaphile!\n________________________\n\n**Fred**: You sure about this vàng pronounced as wàng? /w/ is represent for \"h\" in Vietnamese if I am wrong so wàng come from hoàng.\n___________________\n\n**Bob**: /hw/ is simplified as /w/ just as /kw/ is simplified as /w/ in Southern Vietnamese. The letter v historically was used interchangeably with u and could represent the /w/ sound. ",

To preface this, my sister-in-law is a woman I've always had respect for because she's generally intelligent and has always been nice to my wife and me.\n\nThis past Saturday we were having an Easter family get together and my sister-in-law and her husband were talking about wanting to visit Japan some time soon, but they were concerned about the language barrier and she says \"We didn't have trouble in western Europe because I took two years of German in college and we stayed in the areas where the romantic languages are spoken.\" So I said \"well how does speaking German help there? You still had a language barrier with the people who speak romance languages.\" To which she replied \"no I didnt. German is a romantic language.\" So at this point I'm sort of looking at her as if she was trolling me and said \"no it's not. German is a germanic language. It's even in the name.\" And here is where it went down hill fast. \"Oh so you're telling me that Frau (her old German teacher from high school she really liked) is wrong and you, some 20 something linguistics student are right? Yeah no.\" I took offense to that and said \"you don't have to believe me, but literally every linguistics professional in the world. I can show you the ethnologue page or the Wikipedia page or any number of comparative linguistics textbooks or even intro linguistics textbooks that say German is most definitely not derived from Latin and not a romance language.\"\n\nThen she walked away from the table, told me I was an idiotic jackass and that German was not related to languages like english, dutch, and Swedish which is why it's commonly considered the hardest language for a native English speaker.",

I post over at /r/TumblrInAction where talk of silly social justice pronouns make up at least a percentage or so of our discussion/mean jokes.\n\nBut today I had a stupid thought. I recognize that it's the kind of thought that comes from complete ignorance of linguistics and may be a very simple question. But it's also the kind of question that will bug me for weeks if I don't just come right out and ask.\n\nDo pronouns matter? Not as in 'we should we get rid of all pronouns'. But if the shitload of pronouns that Tumblr social justice takes seriously would be taken seriously by the rest of us, what would that do? Is there some kind of precedent or theory about what happens to a language when something like that happens? \n\nI have said in the past that the social justice crowd seems to treat the basic ways of human beings interacting with each other like a Wikipedia article. I guess what I'm asking is \"what happens if a language changes too much too fast (with specifically this social justice BS as an example)?\"\n\nEDIT: I didn't want to ask over at /r/linguistics because I thought they might have more important shit to deal with.",
