        "text": "I was sitting outside the small entrance to the Optymistychna Cave with my radio equipment, shivering in the cold February air, and listened carefully to the strange, barely perceptible broadcast that came and went. My close friend, Dr. Nataliya Morozov, tried to keep warm by walking in circles and stretching her limbs. We had discovered the signals with one of our walkie-talkies by accident while exploring the cave—a large and partly unexplored gypsum cave located in the Ternopil region of western Ukraine—and since then we had spent our free time trying to pinpoint the source of these signals. We hadn’t gotten any closer to an answer though. All we knew, after trying to pick up the signals from anywhere else, was that they were coming from somewhere inside the cave.\n\n“Let’s start a fire, Oleksandr,” said Nataliya. “It’s so damn cold.”\n\n“It’s back!” I said, ignoring her request. “Listen!”\n\nShe rushed over to me and crouched down. We had invested in a better receiver since the discovery, one that could pick up weaker signals, and it had paid off. The voice coming through the static was much clearer, although still a complete mystery to us. It didn’t speak either Ukrainian or Russian nor any other language we could recognize. The closest one was the indigenous Australian language Warlpiri, but after sending some recordings to an expert on that language we learned that although slightly similar they weren’t the same.\n\nOur plan had been to gather a team of experts and venture into the cave’s deepest, most unexplored parts in an attempt to find whoever it was that was broadcasting these signals, but because of the Russian invasion, we had been forced to postpone our plans indefinitely. It wasn’t safe enough for just the two of us to undertake such a risky expedition. All we could do under the circumstances was to record as much as possible of the strange voice and to study it.\n\nWhile completely focused on the voice now, the deafening sound of a fighter jet roared overhead, interrupting our thoughts and causing us to jump in surprise. The noise was thunderous, a deep rumbling that vibrated through the ground and rattled our bones. We looked up and saw the jet streaking across the sky, leaving a trail of white vapor in its wake. This region was still relatively safe from the war, but the sight of the jet still fill us with unease. Just seconds later, there was an explosion. Another jet had been hit—perhaps by a missile or anti-aircraft fire—right above us, sending debris raining down and causing us to scramble for cover. When we looked up again, we saw the pilot parachuting down toward the ground.\n\n“Is it one of ours?” I asked.\n\n“No,” Nataliya said with concern in her voice. “We need to pack up quickly and get back to the car.”\n\nI turned off the receiver and put my stuff back into my backpack as fast as I could. My heart was racing with fear and adrenaline. As we prepared to move out, the pilot touched down between us and our car. He quickly unhooked himself from his parachute and stumbled toward us with his hand reaching for a gun in his holster. We froze in terror for a second, unsure of what to do, and then we turned around and ran back toward the cave. The army had most likely sent out teams to capture him, which he probably knew and would do anything to avoid. Any witnesses that could report his whereabouts would be dangerous to him, so trying to talk to him was out of the question. We ran as fast as we could, but he was right behind us, closing in quickly. I could hear his heavy breathing and the sound of his boots pounding against the ground as he pursued us.\n\nWhen we reached the entrance to the cave, we quickly ran inside and turned on our flashlights. The pilot followed us in, his gun now drawn and pointed in our direction. We could see the fear in his eyes, and we knew that he was just as desperate as we were. Even if he managed to kill us, or take us hostage, his chances of getting out of this situation were slim at best, but even so, he refused to give up and kept coming after us.\n\nWithout thinking, we began to make our way deeper and deeper into the cave, trying to put as much distance as possible between us and the pilot. The narrow passageways were dark and treacherous, and we stumbled and fell several times as we hurried along. Behind us, we could hear the pilot shouting and cursing, his footsteps echoing through the cavern. We knew that we couldn’t outrun him unless we turned our flashlights off which we couldn’t do, but we still kept pushing ourselves out of fear for our lives.\n\nWe kept going for what felt like an eternity, with the sound of the pilot’s footsteps getting closer and closer. Just when we thought we couldn’t go any further, we saw a small crack in the cave wall that we could squeeze through. We quickly made our way through the narrow gap—albeit not without pressing our bodies to their limits—and as we emerged on the other side, we found ourselves in a large chamber. The chamber was dimly lit and there was a small hole in the ceiling that let in a beam of light from the outside. We looked up and saw a glimpse of blue sky, and it filled us with hope. We knew that we were still in danger, but the sight of daylight was a reminder that there was still a world outside the cave, and that we could still escape.\n\n“Can we get up there?” Nataliya said while taking her backpack off. “Help me up! He’s going to be here any moment now.”\n\nI nodded and offered my hands as a step for her to climb onto. She put her foot into my hands and pushed herself up, grabbing onto the edge of the hole. I pushed her up as she struggled to pull herself through the hole. Meanwhile, the pilot was yelling for us to give up, promising not to hurt us while at the same time cursing his predicament. He was close now. Once Nataliya was up, she extended her hands to help me climb up, and I grabbed onto her wrists as she pulled me up.\n\nA gunshot echoed through the chamber, and we heard the bullet whizz past our heads. The pilot had entered the chamber and pulled the trigger. Nataliya and I pressed ourselves out of the hole and onto the rocky terrain outside. It was colder than before, and strong winds whipped our faces as we stumbled down the hillside.\n\n“We need to keep moving,” I gasped, trying to catch my breath. “That maniac is still after us!”\n\nThe snow was blowing so hard in the wind that we could barely see more than a few feet in front of us. We had lost our bearings and couldn’t orient ourselves in the midst of the blizzard. We discussed finding our way back to our car, but we didn’t know which direction to head in. I looked back, seeing the pilot—no more than a shadow behind all the snow—squeezing himself through the hole. Stumbling through the snow, we saw a strange structure looming in the distance. It was a huge metallic tower, unlike anything we had ever seen before—especially not in this area, which we knew better than most. We could barely make out its shape in the blinding snow, but it looked like it was at least a few stories tall.\n\n“What is that?” Nataliya said.\n\nWe ran toward it—it being our only hope of finding help—slipping and sliding on the icy ground. As we approached, we saw a small building at the foot of the tower. Its architecture was distinct with intricate details and ornate patterns I couldn’t recognize.\n\n“What *is* this place?” I asked when we got closer. “This isn’t supposed to—”\n\nNataliya looked at the top of the tower, seemingly so amazed by it that she had forgotten about our pursuer. “This is it.” Her voice was filled with wonder.\n\n“What?” I said. “We need to get inside and call for help.”\n\n“Don’t you understand, Oleksandr? It’s… It’s the *source*.”\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine. The source, of course. I couldn’t wrap my head around what kind of place this was or how it could be that we had never seen it before, but it did look like some kind of radio tower. The pilot appeared as a silhouette inside the snowstorm, closing in on us.\n\n“Let’s get inside quickly,” I urged Nataliya, pulling her towards the building. “He’s right behind us.”\n\nWe reached the door of the building and tried to open it, but it was locked from the inside. Panic started to set in as the pilot approached us, gun still in hand. Then the ground beneath us began to shake, and we heard a deafening roar. At first, I thought the gunshot from earlier might have set off an avalanche from the top of the hill, but just as that thought crossed my mind something astonishing appeared in the icy mist. Nataliya grabbed my shoulder and pulled me toward her.\n\n“My God,” she said. “Those are mammoths!”\n\nWe pressed ourselves against the wall to avoid being crushed, and then—amazed—we watched the herd stampeding toward us, their massive bodies causing the ground to tremble with each step. The pilot was caught off guard and stumbled backward, dropping his gun. He tried to crawl away from the approaching herd but to no avail. We lost track of him amongst the mammoths as they rampaged past us, their enormous tusks and trunks throwing up clouds of snow and ice.\n\nOnce everything had cleared, Nataliya and I cautiously ran up to where the pilot had been. We found him lying on the ground, alive but hurt. His arm was badly twisted, and blood seeped through his sleeve. We quickly realized that he was in no condition to pursue us.\n\n“We need to help him,” I said. “Let’s drag him to the tower.”\n\n“Those were freaking mammoths!” Nataliya exclaimed, still in shock. “How is that even possible?”\n\n“I have no idea,” I replied, trying to focus on the task at hand. “Right now, we need to get this guy some help.”\n\nDragging him toward the building, a growl cut through the air, causing us to freeze. The pilot tried to sit up and saw something that made him scream. Two large beasts slowly approached us, stepping out of the stormy winds like phantoms, their eyes fixed on the injured pilot.\n\n“T-those are cave lions,” Nataliya stuttered. “That’s what the mammoths were running away from.” She turned to the pilot and grabbed him by his collar. “Your gun!” she yelled to his face. “Do you still have your gun?”\n\nThe pilot, still in a state of panic, shook his head. “N-no,” he said.\n\nOne of the lions charged toward us, its jaws opening wide as it prepared to attack. I braced myself for the worst, but just before it reached us, the door to the building was flung open, and a tall man dressed in the most peculiar way—in a white uniform and a green turban—stepped out and fired two shots into the air. The lions paused for a moment as if to consider their options, before turning and fleeing back into the storm.\n\nThe man proceeded to point his rifle at us. His facial features made me flinch. It was like no other face I had ever seen before. His features were strong and angular, his forehead sloping back from his prominent brow ridge. His nose was broad and flat, and his eyes were deep-set and hooded. He had a prominent chin, and his teeth were large and white. I couldn’t place his ethnicity or origin, and there was something about him that made my heart skip a beat.\n\nHe spoke the same language we had heard over the receiver outside the cave, confirming this was indeed the source of the signals. We raised our hands over our heads. The pilot had to struggle to get up, and couldn’t keep his broken arm up, but he yielded just like us. The man in the turban seemed just as unsettled by seeing us as we were seeing him. He yelled into the building. A woman wearing the same outfit joined him in the doorframe, took a look at us, and then ran inside again.\n\n“What in heaven’s name is going on?” I whispered. “Who are these people?”\n\n“It’s impossible,” Nataliya said. “The animals…” She lowered her voice. “This man doesn’t belong to the same species as—”\n\nThe man yelled at us, maybe to shut us up, and was joined by two others also pointing their rifles pointed at us. I was so cold by now that my teeth were chattering out of control and my fingers were going numb. The pilot began speaking Russian, asking not to be shot, unaware that these people didn’t understand his or—as it seemed—any other language we knew of. Nataliya hushed him.\n\n“What’s going on?” he whispered in reply. “Who are they?”\n\n“Denisovans”, Nataliya whispered back. “Now shut up.”\n\nI looked at her, shocked. “Denisovans? But they went extinct thousands of years ago!”\n\n“I know, I know,” she replied, “but that’s the only explanation for what we just saw. They’re not human, at least not the same as us. We need to be careful.”\n\nThe man in the turban approached us, his rifle still in our faces. He searched us, took our belongings, and then he spoke again and gestured for us to follow him. Reluctantly, we complied. The men led us into the building, which turned out to be a massive underground complex. The walls were adorned with intricate carvings and mosaics, depicting scenes of war and conquest. There were tools and documents scattered around, as well as what looked like large computers from fifty years ago.\n\nWe were brought to a room where the woman who had briefly looked at us was waiting. She gestured for us to sit, and then left the room, closing the door behind her. The pilot rushed to the door and banged on it, yelling to be released.\n\n“Calm down!” Nataliya yelled. “You really think that’s going to work?”\n\nI sat down on the floor with my back against the wall. “Nataliya,” I said. “I’m trying to wrap my head around what’s going on, but it’s just so surreal. How did we end up here?”\n\nNataliya inspected the strange equipment. “I don’t understand it either, but from what we’ve seen I think it’s fair to say we’ve entered a realm where history took another turn somewhere. In our world, humanity outcompeted our closest hominid relatives—the Neanderthals and the Denisovans—and we partly hunted the megafauna to extinction. Right? Now here… It’s as if the footprint of man was never made.” She pulled out a large sheet of paper that was rolled up among a bunch of other documents. “Ah, look at this!” It was a black-and-white map. I got up on my feet and joined her. “This map has a different orientation than our own,” Nataliya continued. “See? It has the same continents, but Asia is much closer to the center. Goes to show how subjective our worldview is, doesn’t it?”\n\n“There doesn’t seem to be any borders,” I added.\n\n“Except this giant one separating Europe from Asia,” added Nataliya.\n\n“And what’s the meaning of these?” I asked, pointing at pictograms of skulls that dotted the map. “Some kind of dead zones?”\n\n“Or something completely different.” Nataliya pulled away some of her hair from her face and pointed at central Europe. “Look, the skulls are different here. My God… I think those are the skulls of Neanderthals. And…” She dragged her finger across the continents. “I can’t see any skulls resembling our own.” She looked up at me. “Oleksandr, I don’t think our species even exist in this world. It’s just as if we never evolved here or went extinct before we could get our footing right.”\n\n“Enough of this!” yelled the pilot who had grown frustrated with our conversation. “This is some kind of trick, some kind of psychological warfare that you learned from the Americans.”\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked, speaking Russian.\n\n“Boris,” he said. “What is it to you, huh?”\n\n“Boris,” Nataliya pleaded. “This isn’t a trick. You saw those mammoths, the cave lions. How in the hell would anyone be able to *fake* that? Oleksandr and I were investigating strange radio signals coming from the cave. We already knew something strange was going on here, although we couldn’t have guessed that this—a parallel *universe*—was the answer.”\n\nBoris bit his nails. “I’m not supposed to be here. I was on my last mission before I was supposed to retire. My family is waiting for me back home.”\n\n“Many people don’t have families to go home to any more thanks to you and your friends,” I said. “You tried to murder us, two civilians!”\n\n“Let’s not argue about that,” said Nataliya. “We need to work together if we want to get out of here safely.”\n\n“I wasn’t going to kill you,” Boris said. “I’m not a killer. I was merely trying to stop you.”\n\n“Oh, come on,” I said. “You were literarily flying a death machine!”\n\n“I’m a soldier!” Boris yelled. “I was just following orders. Politics doesn’t interest me. But there are always two sides to every conflict.”\n\n“Yes,” I said, “and sometimes one of the sides is a fascist war criminal who commits atrocities against innocent civilians!”\n\nBoris looked down, his face showing a mix of shame and anger. “I know. I’ve seen it happen. But what choice did I have? Refusing to follow orders would have meant risking my life and my family’s. And what good would that have done? There’s no justice in war.”\n\n“Maybe not,” I said. “But that doesn’t mean we should give up on trying to do what’s right. We can’t let those in power get away with their crimes. Do you really think Putin cares about your people? He’s the epitome of an evil dictator! Your country could’ve been great, Boris, but instead, you live—”\n\n“I said I don’t care about politics!” Boris interrupted. “I care about my *family*, about providing for my wife and daughter.”\n\n“We need to put all of that behind us now,” said Nataliya. “We’ve stumbled upon the greatest discovery ever made, something that changes our understanding of reality completely. This is bigger than any of our grievances… bigger than ourselves. Don’t you see?”\n\n“You’re right,” I said. “Any idea why they’re keeping us here?”\n\n“This isn’t a jail cell,” Nataliya said. “It’s just an office. My guess is that they’re as surprised by us as we’re by them. We look more similar to Neanderthals than we look to them, especially you Oleksandr… No offense.”\n\n“None taken,” I said a bit grumpily. “By all means, continue.”\n\n“Still,” she said, “our faces are distinct, and combined with our clothes I don’t think they’ll confuse us with Neanderthals. They know we don’t belong here, and they’re probably trying to figure out what to do with us.”\n\nJust then, the door opened again, and the woman walked in, accompanied by two guards. She spoke to us in her language and gestured for us to follow them. We were brought outside where a large, armored vehicle awaited us. It was unlike anything we had seen before, painted white and adorned with beautiful patterns.\n\nTwo armed men opened the back doors to the vehicle. The woman gestured for us to enter, and we complied, not wanting to anger our captors. The interior smelled of gasoline and metal, and we were jolted as the vehicle started moving. I stood up and looked out of the tiny windows at the back, but only saw the everlasting snow.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThey brought us to a massive complex, hidden away in the middle of nowhere. The building was enormous, made of concrete and steel, and surrounded by high walls topped with barbed wire. All were painted white, which made it almost impossible to see against the snow. The guards led us inside, down long corridors and through heavy metal doors.\n\nFinally, we arrived at an empty room with a couple of beds in it and a large observation window on the wall. A man could be seen behind it, wearing a green turban just like the others and a decorated uniform of some kind. The guards left us and closed the door behind them, locking it with a loud clank.\n\nBoris quickly ran up to the observation window and began yelling, again seemingly without realizing that they couldn’t understand him. More people arrived behind the window to look at him, almost as if they found him entertaining.\n\n“Sit down!” Nataliya said. “I can’t hear my own thoughts.”\n\nBoris quieted down, fell down with his back against the wall, and began to cry while mumbling something about his wife.\n\n“This doesn’t look good, Nataliya,” I said. “What do they want with us?”\n\n“It all depends on what they know about our species,” she said. “If my suspicion is correct and Homo sapiens went extinct here, they would be very interested in studying us. They also got my phone earlier, and it will probably make us look more alien to them than our faces.”\n\n“Their technology seems to be a bit behind ours,” I said. “But their culture is remarkable, their art… Just look at their architecture! These people are no less than us, that’s for sure. I wonder what the Neanderthals are like.”\n\n“Will they ever let us out of here?” Boris cried. “I need to go home… I need to see my wife and daughter!”\n\nI felt a pinch of empathy for him, but not much more.\n\n“Unfortunately, I don’t think they’ll let us go,” I said. “Would your government have released a captured member of another species from a parallel universe?” I laughed bitterly at the thought of it. “No, they’ll keep us here and study us like—”\n\n“There’s still hope,” Nataliya said. “What they’ll want to know most of all is where we come from. This gives us the upper hand to a degree. We can try to communicate that we’ll show them the cave, and once they take us there, I don’t know, maybe we can make a run for it or something.”\n\n“They wouldn’t bring all of us there,” I said. “That would be foolish. I say we keep the cave a secret. We don’t want them to know about our world, do we?”\n\nA woman behind the observation window spoke from a speaker, and then two guards entered the room and took Boris with them. He struggled but to no avail. I thought they would interrogate him and bring him back, but after several hours had passed, I realized that they had probably just taken him somewhere else, perhaps because he was injured, or maybe because he was dressed like a soldier, unlike me and Nataliya.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, they finally brought me and Nataliya to another room. There were two women there, dressed in what looked like green hijabs and white surgical masks. The guards never left, holding their fingers close to their triggers. The women placed us in front of what looked like an old camera on a tripod and began taking pictures of us. We were then instructed to undress, which made us both feel uncomfortable and violated. We hesitated, but the guards made it clear that it wasn’t a request.\n\nOnce we were in our undergarments, the women began examining us closely, taking notes and measurements. I felt like a lab rat and cringed at the thought of being just that for the rest of my life. Two large syringes were brought forth on a metallic tray, which they used to draw our blood. After about an hour, they handed us some clothes, simple robes made of rough fabric that scratched our skin, and then they brought us to yet another room where they forced us to sit down in front of another man in a green turban. He said a few words to us but seemed aware of the fact that we couldn’t understand him.\n\n“Nataliya”, I said and pointed at her and then I pointed at myself and said my own name.\n\nHe smiled and then pointed at himself and said something that sounded like “Yidu”. Next, he put a small map of the region on the table—something I only understood because I recognized the Zbruch River—and nodded toward it, seemingly asking us to show him where we came from.\n\n“Should we tell him?” asked Nataliya. “Maybe it’s—”\n\nThe entire building shook, and the vague sound of an explosion could be heard from above. Yidu looked up, concerned, and then shouted something at the guards. Another explosion could be heard, and then a strangely melodic alarm began blaring throughout the building. The guards forced us up on our feet and ushered us out of the room. Nataliya, who was the last person to leave the room, quickly grabbed the map on the table without anyone noticing in the confusion and hid it behind her back. We were led toward the cell they had kept us in. People were running in every direction, shouting and screaming while the deafening, strange tune sounded over our heads on repeat—filling the air with its haunting melody. For every explosion above ground, the lights flickered, and dust fell from the ceiling. Then, a gunshot echoed through the chaos, and one of the guards fell to the ground. The other guard fired his rifle but was shot in the leg before he could reload. Boris, holding one of their rifles, stood in front of us. They had shaved his head, and there was a large wound on his cheek.\n\n“Boris!” Nataliya said. “What’s happening?”\n\n“They’re under attack,” he said. “I managed to overpower my guard in the commotion and took his gun.”\n\n“This is our chance!” I said. “We need to find a way out of here!”\n\nBoris nodded, and we quickly followed him as he led us through the maze of corridors and rooms. The sound of gunfire and explosions echoed through the halls as we stumbled our way forward. We passed by rooms filled with equipment and supplies, but we didn’t stop to investigate. Our only focus was finding a way out of this hellish place.\n\nAs we turned a corner, we were faced with a group of armed guards. They immediately opened fire—almost as if they thought we belonged to whatever enemy was attacking them—and we were forced to take cover behind a nearby metal cabinet. Boris returned fire, taking out one of the guards, but we were outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n“We need to find another way!” Nataliya shouted over the noise.\n\nBoris looked around and spotted a ventilation shaft above us. “That way!” he yelled, pointing upward.\n\nWe quickly climbed onto the cabinet and reached for the opening, pulling ourselves up into the shaft. It was cramped and dusty, but it offered a way out. We crawled as quickly as we could, the sounds of the chaos below us growing quieter as we moved farther away.\n\nFinally, after what felt like forever, we saw a dim light up ahead. We hurried toward it and found ourselves at the exit of the ventilation system. Boris pushed open the grate and we climbed out into a deserted hallway. It was eerily quiet, even though we could still hear the distant sounds of the alarm and gunfire.\n\n“There must be an exit here somewhere,” I said, and we started to move toward some stairs that seem to lead to the ground level. As we climbed, we could see signs of the attack all around us—cracks in the walls, shattered glass, and the occasional dead body.\n\nFinally, we burst through the door to the outside and were met with cold winds whipping our faces. It was the middle of the night now. The alarm echoed through the darkness. Above us, three black airships hovered with spotlights pointed at the ground, and a convoy of black, cumbersome tanks rolled past us. We crouched behind a nearby wall, trying to avoid detection. The tanks were unlike anything we had seen here so far, and the commanders wore dark uniforms and black metal helmets, unlike the Denisovan we had encountered before.\n\n“My God,” Nataliya said. “Neanderthals!”\n\nA bright light shone on us, and we froze. A group of Neanderthal soldiers had spotted us, and they were pointing their rifles at us. We slowly raised our hands, unsure of what to do next. But then, one of the soldiers was hit by a bullet, and he fell to the ground. We turned to see a group of Denisovans, taking cover behind a burnt-out vehicle while firing at the Neanderthals, and we managed to get away through the turmoil that followed.\n\n“How are we supposed to find our way back to the cave?” I asked while we plodded through the snow to get as far away from the compound as possible.\n\n“I got the map,” she said. “I can use celestial navigation and—”\n\n“That’s not what I meant!” I said. “We won’t get far in these old rags they forced us into until we freeze to death!”\n\nNataliya stopped. “What are you suggesting?”\n\n“We need to sneak our way back and steal one of their trucks,” I said. “I mean, it’s the only way we’ll make it out of here alive.”\n\nNataliya hesitated, but then nodded in agreement. “Okay, let’s do it. But we need to be careful and stay out of sight.”\n\nBoris looked unhappy about it, but even he realized that walking through the blizzard was a death sentence.\n\nWe made our way back to the compound, keeping low and avoiding any of the soldiers. We searched for a vehicle that was still in good condition and could get us out of there fast. After several failed attempts—mostly because most of them were locked—we finally found a large vehicle with tracks and a snowplow that seemed to be in decent shape and that wasn’t locked.\n\nBoris quickly got in the driver’s seat and started to fiddle with the controls, but the vehicle wouldn’t budge.\n\n“Do you think you can drive this thing?” Nataliya asked as we sat down next to him.\n\n“I can drive anything,” he grumbled, but his attempts to get the engine going were futile.\n\n“We need to get out of here now!” I urged as the sound of approaching soldiers grew louder.\n\nFinally, after several nerve-wracking minutes, the engine roared to life, and Boris grinned triumphantly. However, as he started to drive away, a shot rang out, and he slumped over in his seat, a bullet lodged in his belly. I screamed in terror, but Boris somehow managed to keep the vehicle moving.\n\nAnother vehicle pursued us, its headlights shining on us like a spotlight. We swerved and skidded over the icy terrain as we careened around corners and dodged obstacles in our path. The Denisovans in the pursuing vehicle fired at us, and we could hear the bullets whizzing past us.\n\nNataliya took Boris’s rifle and did her best to return fire leaning out of the window, but her aim was shaky, and we didn’t have much ammunition left. Boris was fading fast, but he gritted his teeth and kept driving, his blood staining the seat beneath him. Nataliya gave me the rifle and tried to help Boris by applying pressure to his wound, all while she also tried to keep her eye on the map in her lap.\n\n“Stay with us,” she said, her voice shaking.\n\nBoris groaned in response, but he didn’t give up. His driving was erratic, and the vehicle was getting more difficult to control as we sped through the blizzard. I could see the panic in his eyes as he struggled to keep us on course.\n\nI turned around and smashed the back window of the vehicle and pointed the rifle behind us, hoping to deter our pursuers. The Denisovans continued to fire at us, and I fired back, the recoil making my arms ache. I was a terrible shot, I always had been, and it felt as if I wasn’t aiming at all, but after a few shots, I saw the driver in the pursuing vehicle slump over, and the vehicle swerved off course and crashed into a snowdrift.\n\n“I did it!” I shouted, turning back to Boris and Nataliya. But my triumph was short-lived as I saw Boris’s eyes slowly close, and his breathing becoming shallower.\n\n“Boris, no!” Nataliya yelled. “Stay awake, don’t let go!”\n\nPanic rose within me as I realized we might not be able to make it without him, seeing how difficult the vehicle was to operate. Then, I saw a faint glimmer in the distance. It was a lantern attached to the top of the radio tower. We were close.\n\n“We’re almost there!” I said, pointing toward the light. “Just hold on a little longer, Boris.”\n\nWhen we reached the hillside, Boris fell into Nataliya’s lap with his pallid face turned up toward us. He was crying now, tears streaming down his face as he struggled to speak.\n\n“My family,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. “Tell them I love them. Tell my wife and daughter... Helena, tell her I wished— Helena, Helena…”\n\nHis words trailed off as he gasped for breath, and then he was gone. We dragged him out of the vehicle, and even though the night was freezing and the storm raged on around us, we decided to bury him under some snow and rocks. It was ironic, I thought, that a man who had once terrorized Ukrainian civilians were now being buried by two of them. But in his final moments, Boris had shown bravery and sacrifice that he deserved recognition for, even though it didn’t undo the harm he had caused in the past.\n\nAs we made our way back to the cave, which was a struggle against the elements which took hours, I couldn’t help but reflect on the complexities of war and the toll it takes on everyone involved. Boris had been a soldier, following orders and fighting for his country, but in the end, he had died a hero for two strangers from the very country he had fought against. And I thought about this other world, about the Denisovans and Neanderthals, and how they seemed to be caught up in the same cycles of senseless violence as Homo sapiens. Sadness gripped me thinking how universal it was, the propensity for violence and conflict… for war.\n\nBack on our side, we covered up the hole that led to the other world with large rocks to stop anyone from that alternate Earth to venture onto ours. We then sent an anonymous letter to Boris’s family, to let them know he didn’t die a war criminal and that he loved them.\n\nI’ve returned to the cave with my receiver occasionally, just to confirm that what we went through really happened… that deep inside that hill, there’s a cave to another world.\n\n[ME](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/)",

        "text": " \"I'm bored what do you want to do?\" \n\n\n I asked my friends. All of them were just sitting on their phones like I was. I was getting bored quick from scrolling through Tiktok and YouTube. \n\n\n Marcus and Sarah just looked at me and shrugged. TJ just laughed probably at some meme that none of us get. Rebecca was just reading a book. \n\n\n It was Friday night and I didn't want this to be the start of our weekend. Then a memory popped into my head and I got up to grab my stuff. \n\n\n \"What are you doing?\" TJ asked.\n\n\n I smugly looked back at them. \"How about we do something more fun?\" Sarah then snaps up with a smile on her face. \"What are you thinking Mary? Drinks at the bar?\" \n\n\n I shake my head. \"We are going to play the Graveyard Game.\" \n\n\n Marcus then looked up since he likes stuff based around the supernatural and going into haunted houses. \"Is it spooky?\" \n\n\n I nod my head yes at him which makes the others pay more attention. \"Basically what you do is go into a graveyard at night with no phones or flashlight and play hide and seek.\" \n\n\n Marcus then got up. \"Sounds like fun! Who's in guys?\" Everyone else then got up and grabbed their things. TJ and Rebecca weren't as enthusiastic but they figured to just go along with us. As we were heading out the door Sarah went up beside me and said, \"next time I say we go to a bar\". \n\n\n We then take a long drive to the city's cemetery. No lights were on which is perfect for the setting. We left our phones in the car and got out. \n\n\n Hemingway Cemetery still looks eerie even at night. The cold wind added to the creepy atmosphere along with the moving trees. There was a strong wind yesterday so there was fallen brush everywhere on the ground. \n\n\n \"So who's going to be it?\" Rebecca asks.\n\n\n \"I say we draw branches and whoever got the longest will be it.\" Marcus replied. \n\n\n We all picked up 5 branches. Then we closed our eyes and picked one at random. TJ got the longest one. He yelled out in enjoyment and went to the closest tree to start counting. We all then ran to our hiding places. \n\n\n Even with the darkness enveloped around us like this I can clearly see my surroundings. I always had a natural talent in seeing better in the dark. That's why my little brother Randy always got mad at me for winning when we were little. \n\n\n I then decided that my hiding spot will be behind an old tree. \n\n\n Whenever I went over there and knelt down the crunch of branches startled me. \n\n\n \"10!\" \n\n\n I quickly became quite but it was no use as I was found first. I went and stood by the car while TJ finds the others. When it was only Sarah left to find I got a chill breeze on my neck. It felt like someone was blowing air on it. I turned around but no one was there. \n\n\n I shuddered but thought that it was just this graveyard freaking me out. \n\n\n TJ at last found Sarah and she was proud of herself. She said that she hid in a dumpster. Marcus them yelled at her saying that she could get sick from that but she just scoffed from him. Me and Rebecca laughed. \n\n\n I then went to the same tree that TJ was at and started counting. \n\n\n \"1!\" \n\n\n \"2!\" \n\n\n \"3!\" \n\n\n \"4!\" \n\n\n \"5!\" \n\n\n I felt that cold breeze on the back of my neck again. I shivered as I still thought of it as nothing. \n\n\n \"6!\" \n\n\n \"7!\" \n\n\n \"8!\"\n\n\n\"9!\"\n\n\n \"10!\"\n\n\n I then jumped as I didn't even say 10. The voice didn't even sound like my friends. I quickly turned around but no one was there. Freaked out I quickly tried to find them.\n\n\n TJ hid himself behind a small hill grove by the pond. Rebecca and Marcus were found behind a grave and a tree. I then put my thinking cap on and went to find Sarah. \n\n\n Whenever we would play these sort of games Sarah would always try to out do the rest of us. I think that's what we like about her. She ain't afraid to get in trouble neither. \n\n\n \"Sarah! Sarah!\" \n\n\n After a few minutes I quickly gave up on trying to find her. Laughing I saw her up in one of the trees. \"Think you can help me down?\" She asks still trying to hold in her laughter. \n\n\n When we got back to the others we decided that Sarah would be it as punishment. \n\n\n She didn't like it as she complained but went ahead and counted. \n\n\n \"1!\"\n\n\n \"2!\"\n\n\n \"3!\"\n\n\n \"4!\" \n\n\n \"5!\" \n\n\n There was a little pause as she stopped counting but then it resumed. \n\n\n \"6!\" \n\n\n \"7!\" \n\n\n \"8!\" \n\n\n \"9!\" \n\n\n \"10!\" \n\n\n I quickly tried not to move. I hid behind a bench that was close to the spot where Marcus hid. He was hiding behind a large rock. \n\n\n It became quite for a bit. The darkness and noise of the wind made me shudder. Marcus kept looking above the rock while mouthing at me where she could be. I just shrugged my shoulders. \n\n\n When it took too lomg me and Marcus just got up and tried to look for everybody. We couldn't see anyone. \n\n\n \"Where could they be?\" I asked Marcus. \n\n\n \"I don't know but i don't like the looks of this\". He said. \n\n\n When we got to the car we jumped as all of them jumped out at us from behind the car. They all started laughing when we calmed down and TJ said that he was the one to come up with the idea. \n\n\n \"TJ you asshole!\" Marcus yelled as he tackled him. \n\n\n After a little bit of tussling around they got off the ground. Marcus then said that he was counting this time. \n\n\n \"10!\"\n\n\n \"9!\" \n\n\n \"8!\" \n\n\n \"7!\"\n\n\n \"6!\" \n\n\n \"5!\" \n\n\n \"4!\" \n\n\n \"3!\" \n\n\n  \"2!\" \n\n\n  \"1!\"\n\n\n When he said 1 I hid behind a gravestone a while away. I figured that I was covered enough by that gravestone. But while hiding behind it I felt that cold chill on my neck again\n\n\n This time I swung around ready to catch it but no one was there. I went and quickly ducked down. As I did i heard a voice inches away from my ear. \n\n\n \"Mary.\" \n\n\n Now that made me shriek out as Marcus found me. He asked me what was wrong and i told him about the voice. He then said that we should just get out of there and I agreed. \n\n\n As we were all getting in the car laughing and freaked out I just couldn't get that chill feeling behind me. Also who said my name. I didn't know if it was the person whose gravestone I hid behind or if I awoke something in that graveyard. \n\n\n I hope that I will never find out. \n\n\n But it was already too late as Marcus sent a picture in the group chat of the back side of his car. It was a set of handprints. \n\n\n I shuddered as they were right behind the seat that I was in.\n\n\n If any of you were in this type of situation what does it mean? Should i look out for any signs that this ghost or spirit followed me home? I will keep you all updated on what happens. Thank you. \n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/lingeringshadows/comments/11j7um0/have_you_played_the_graveyard_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "I'm a journalist, and I heard about the rumors surrounding the man in the hood. As a journalist, I had to find out more, and I decided to investigate. I arrived in town and started to talk to people, trying to gather information about the mysterious figure.\n\nEveryone seemed to be scared of the man in the hood, but no one knew who he was or where he came from. Some people claimed to have seen him use supernatural powers to control the elements, while others said he could make objects move without touching them.\n\nI talked to a woman who claimed to have seen the man in the hood standing in front of her house, staring at her through the window. She said she was too scared to move and that he stood there for hours before disappearing into the night.\n\nAnother person I spoke to told me about a group of teenagers who dared each other to approach the man in the hood. They crept up to him, trying to catch a glimpse of his face, but as they got closer, the man suddenly vanished, leaving only his hood behind.\n\nThese stories were chilling, and I knew there was more to the man in the hood than just rumors. So, I decided to dig deeper.\n\nI started to research the history of the town, looking for any clues that might help me understand who the man in the hood was. It took me weeks, but I finally found something.\n\nThere was a man who lived in the town many years ago. He was a recluse who always wore a hood, never revealing his face to anyone. People called him the \"Hooded Man.\" He was rumored to have supernatural powers and could control the elements.\n\nI found an old newspaper article about him. It said that the man had disappeared one night, and no one had ever seen him again. The article also mentioned that strange things had been happening in the town since his disappearance, such as sudden storms and objects moving on their own.\n\nI decided to talk to some of the older residents in town to see if they knew anything about the Hooded Man. One woman I spoke to said that her grandfather used to tell her stories about the man in the hood. He said that the Hooded Man had made a deal with the devil and that he could control the elements.\n\nAnother man told me that his father had seen the Hooded Man once, and that he was the most terrifying thing he had ever seen. He said that the man's eyes were black as coal and that he had an otherworldly presence about him.\n\nAs I continued my investigation, I started to realize that there was something dark and sinister about the man in the hood. I began to fear for my own safety as I delved deeper into the mystery.\n\nOne night, as I was walking back to my hotel, I saw the man in the hood standing in the shadows. I froze, too scared to move. But the man didn't do anything. He just stood there, watching me.\n\nI knew then that I had to get out of town, but I couldn't leave without finding out more about the man in the hood. So, I continued my investigation, but I was always looking over my shoulder, afraid that the man in the hood was watching me.\n\nMonths went by, and I still couldn't find any concrete evidence about the Hooded Man. But then, one night, something strange happened.\n\nI was sitting in my hotel room, working on my laptop, when I heard a knock on the door. I got up to answer it, but when I opened the door, no one was there. I looked around, but there was no one in the hallway.\n\nAs I closed the door, I saw something move in the shadows. It was the man in the hood. He was standing outside my room, staring at me through the window. I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized that he had been watching me this entire time.\n\nI tried to call the police, but my phone was dead, and the hotel phone was out of order. I was trapped, alone in my room with the man in the hood watching me.\n\nSuddenly, the lights went out, and the room was plunged into darkness. I could hear the man moving around outside my door, and I knew that he was coming for me.\n\nI huddled in the corner, my heart racing, as the door slowly creaked open. The man in the hood stepped inside, and I could see the glint of his eyes in the darkness.\n\nHe approached me slowly, and I could feel his breath on my face. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as he had appeared, the man in the hood was gone. The lights flickered back on, and I was alone in my room.\n\nI left town the next day, never looking back. I still don't know who the man in the hood was or what he wanted from me. But one thing is for sure, I will never forget that night or the feeling of pure terror that overtook me in the presence of the Hooded Man.",

        "text": "Daniel sent a video to the group chat with a message:\n‘Have you seen this guys?’\nI clicked onto it. It showed an advertisement for a new face cream that made you unimaginably beautiful.\n‘We should get it for our girlfriends.’ He texted again ‘except you Tom you haven’t got one XD’ \nDan liked to call Me out on this fact for everyone else in our group had a girlfriend except me. Little did I know this was my biggest advantage.\n4 days later and about a dozen phone called and texts none of my friends would answer. Not even josh, who was always checking the group chat. Another hour. Another hour and half. Another day when I finally get a message from pat to come to the woods. Near the makeshift swing. So I go. As I walk through my streets I see nobody out. There was no noise coming from anywhere. It seemed as if everyone had ran away. \nWe lived on an island of sorts. Away from society and big countries. So if anyone wasn’t an evacuation, like me, they would know.\nAs I am thinking this I see a tall person in a pink and black dress walking into the woods. I think it might be pats girlfriend. So I shout her name.\n“Cara!” My voice echoed through the town. \nI hear a snarl like something off a dog emitting from a nearby café. A groan like somebody that is board of something. And… a screech unlike any other. Then a deafening silence. I pry my eyes away from the café and look towards the woods. I see 11 tall people. But I can nearly call them people. Their arms stretch down enough so they can touch their calf’s with ought even bending down. Their necks being twice as long as any average person’s. Their legs smaller than usual. Their bloodstained clothes looking like they are three sizes too small. But then I see their shirts. I notice who always wears them. It was my friends and their girlfriends. But a bad copy of them. Before I have chance to say anything one of them says. \n“S..o beautiful.” I couldn’t see their heads because their torsos stretched unnaturally so their heads were covered by the leaves and shade.\nAs soon as one started they all started.\n“Beautiful.” One said.\n“So beautiful.”\n“Such beauty.”\n“Beautiful.”\n“Beautiful.”\n“BEAUTIFUL!”\nTheir voices kept getting louder and louder until it just became a screech. \nThey charged, On all fours, Towards me. Making a deafening scream that made my ears ring. I swear I even saw a window crack. I turned and ran. I could tell as I started I wasn’t going to outrun them. The only chance I had was to get to the forest. I knew it like the back of my hand. So I had to run around the café alleyway and get around these imitations of humans. There was a bunker type thing that me and my friends dug out. It was a hole with quite a bit of space and a stash of snacks. And also my only hope. I darted into the alleyway and behind me I heard them bashing into each other and stumbling down it themselves. I entered another street on the other of the café and run as fast as my legs can take me. \nAs rush into the narrow trees of the Forrest I hear them jumping through the trees like monkeys. After a while I stop hearing the swishing of leaves, the snapping and their screams fade into the distance of branches and I make my way to the bunker. I hear their screams coming closer and going away again. \nI get to it and slide into the hole. I put the makeshift door (a pillow) into the hole I slid in and a feeling of safety washes over me. I sit down and start eating a packet of crisp. As I sit down in the middle of the room I hear somebody whisper…\n“Beautiful.”",

My first order of business was getting René inside and away from the coming dawn. He had healed considerably in the boat as we rode back to my dock, but was still weak. I slipped his arm over my shoulder and helped guide him back to the cottages. Jake walked beside us, looking in disbelief around him.\n\n“Not used to being around here when it’s not a full moon.”\n\n“Did you ever even go inside Cottage 13?” I asked.\n\n“Maybe once or twice. Sometimes I’ve slept on the porch, waiting for dawn.”\n\n“Well, it’s yours if it’s in decent enough condition for you.”\n\n“I’m sure it’s better than what I’m used to. Thank you.”\n\n“I need to help René. Go take a rest.”\n\nHe nodded.\n\nI brought René back to my cottage.\n\n“I’m fine,” he said weakly. “I’ll just get back home now.”\n\n“There’s no way you’ll be able to get there in time, just get inside. I have blackout shades.”\n\nHe mumbled some form of protest. I brought him into my bedroom and lowered him to the bed.\n\n“Not the way I thought I’d see the inside of this room,” he chuckled with a smirk. I threw a pillow at him, feeling my face turn red.\n\n“Stop it. Just rest in here today.”\n\n“Where will you sleep? You need rest too.”\n\n“I’m not the one who would fry to a crisp if I slept on the couch.”\n\n“Fair.”\n\nIt was a bit jarring to see him in a state of weakness. *What if the fire had lasted a bit longer?* *What would I have done if he had truly died?* I brushed the thought away before it could hurt me. With so many real things to worry about, why stress about the imaginary? I sat on the bed, overwhelmed with unease.\n\n“René?”\n\n“Yes?” He sat up, leaning on his forearms.\n\n“You’re going to be okay, right?”\n\nHe smiled. \n\n“Perfectly fine. Just need a good day’s sleep.”\n\n“I…I’m really happy to hear that.”\n\nI placed my hand on top of his. He looked up at me, pulled me down towards him, and kissed me. I kissed him back. And for a couple blissful moments, there was nothing else. All too soon, we separated and he lay back down on the bed.\n\n“I must soon sleep, but do not be alarmed if I appear, well, dead.”\n\nI smiled and rose, putting my hand on his shoulder as I did. I turned off the lights, checked the blackout shades once more and closed the door.\n\nThe sun glowed on the horizon, sending out colored bands of oranges, pinks, and yellows across the sky. I managed to sleep a few hours on the couch, but I woke up hungry and caffeine deprived. \n\nMy fridge was still empty. I finished the last cubes of cheddar and managed to toast a piece of stale bread into edibility. Some shopping was certainly in order. I decided to go to my favorite big box store, the one everyone knows with the bullseye, even though it was over a half an hour away in Watertown. \n\nThe utter normalcy of the place was like a salve. Everything was red and fluorescent and I happily picked up far more than what I had came for, including some men’s clothing and plenty of raw meat. I made my way to the self-checkout area feeling more normal than I had in weeks. My items scanned with a pleasing beep and I noticed a woman next to me, picking up some diapers with a jovial, chubby baby clinging to her hip. His mother kissed his forehead and the baby nestled his head on her shoulder. I smiled at them.\n\n“That will never be you,” a voice hissed behind me, crawling around the back of my neck. I turned to find the store employee overseeing the checkout area grinning vacantly, her eyes dull, her lips cracked and stretched too far, exposing black teeth. As I stared at her, her face began to rot, turning a putrid green before the flesh began to slough off. I was frozen to my spot, unable to look away. \n\nThe checkout machine made a discordant noise, indicating I had not put an item in a bag and I was finally able to blink and shake my head.\n\n“You have to put the item down before scanning the next item, Ma’am,” the employee droned. With astonishment, I saw that she was completely normal, her voice brimming with boredom. I swiped my credit card, gathered my bags, and quickly exited the store, shaken to my core. *She’s playing with you*, I thought. *Just as with René and Jake.* I got in my car and checked all around me, especially my mirrors, but there was nothing there and the ride home was thankfully uneventful.\n\nI was back to the cottages by mid-afternoon. Jake was outside smoking a cigarette, a large bucket at his feet. I handed him a bag of clothes and a bag of meat.\n\n“That probably should last you,” I said laughing.\n\nHe looked in the bags and his face erupted into an almost childlike grin, genuinely touched.\n\n“Wow, this is…this is really great. Thank you.”\n\n“You’re welcome.”\n\n“I have something for you too,” he said, placing the bucket before me. It was filled with water in which a perch swam. My stomach sank. It was time for the next payment.\n\n“How did you know?” I asked.\n\n“When I woke up, I went over to your cottage to check on you. You weren’t there, but the door was unlocked. I saw the notebook on the coffee table and couldn’t help myself. Just like old times, I guess. Only this time I’m a little better at fishing.”\n\n“You found Martina’s fishing rod? I thought that was locked in the basement.”\n\n“Oh, I didn’t need the rod. Just grabbed the perch.” \n\n“With…your bare hands?”\n\nHe nodded. I noticed the sleeves of his worn sweater were soaked.\n\n“Ah, yes. Very normal. Okay, then. Care to help me confirm receipt of payment tonight? For old time’s sake? Last time The Wet Lady almost killed me, so I’d appreciate some back up.”\n\n“The Wet Lady, huh? I guess I never thought of her like that before.”\n\n“That was the name I gave her when she haunted me as a child.”\n\nHis face fell.\n\n“This time, I’m not going to fuck it up. I promise.”\n\n“Stop feeling guilty. I have plenty of other things to freak me out now.” I explained how the witch had frightened me at the store, how I feared she would be waiting for me in every mirror until I went mad. Jake listened and nodded. I know he understood.\n\nWhat do you know about [The Wet Lady](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10vpfzw/i_own_an_abandoned_motel_and_ive_just_become/), anyway?” I asked, eager to change the subject.\n\n“Well, it’s not like we had a club for all the entities roaming around Calnon’s cottages,” he chuckled. “But the Mistress…I mean the witch… did love to talk about the thing you call The Wet Lady. It pleased her endlessly, as did any story about great suffering.”\n\n“We still have a couple hours before sunset. Let’s get out of the cold and chat inside.”\n\nWe relocated to my cottage where Jake sat on the couch, while I perched myself on the lone bar stool at the kitchen counter. \n\n“You know, back during Prohibition, this whole area was a hot bed of smuggling and rum-running from Canada,” Jake said. \n\n“I remember my grandfather talking about it. Lots of unsavory characters would occasionally stay at the Cottages when he was a little kid.”\n\n“Indeed. And that’s where the story of The Wet Lady begins. Now you have to remember this is my retelling of the witch’s story. She loved to force me to transform and make me lay at her feet while she amused herself with her own wicked deeds. However, I still think I received a better fate than that of Muriel Davis. \n\nMuriel was a plain farmer’s daughter, growing up on a patch of land just outside of Gouverneur on the eve of the Great Depression. Muriel, like many young people, wanted a more exciting life than what her parents could offer her. She had heard tales of the riches and dancing and romance that could be found in Clayton and in other towns on the river.\n\nWilling to do anything to escape her dull fate, she listened carefully to the old ladies in her village tell tales of an old witch, who could grant all types of wishes to those brave enough to offer her sacrifice. Muriel didn’t care that the tales always ended with tragedy. She thought she was smarter than the rural rubes around her. \n\nSo at midnight one night, she went to a crossroads, cut her palm with a knife and pressed it to a bleached chicken bone she had stolen from the kitchen. The witch appeared to her, as a glamorous woman arrayed in the latest fashions, the very type of woman poor plain Muriel so desperately desired to be. \n\n‘Make me beautiful like you,’ the girl blurted out. The witch smiled indulgently. With an elegant twist of her hand a glass bottle appeared.\n\n‘These are salts for the bath. Use them, and you will become beautiful. But be sure to only use them twice. And as with all such powerful things, girl, there is always a price. If you bath with these, you will never conceive a child. Do you understand?’\n\n‘Yes! I don’t care about that anyway! Just give them to me!’\n\n‘Very well.’\n\nMuriel took the bottle eagerly from the witch’s grasp. The witch studied the girl in front her, but the girl failed to notice the malevolence in her eyes. With a gust of wind, she was gone and Muriel practically ran back to her parents’ home.  She drew a bath in her mother’s tub almost immediately and sprinkled the salts across the top of the water.\n\nShe stepped in the bath and made sure she submerged every bit of her body. The witch hadn’t told her how long she should take, so she stayed in that bath until the water was freezing cold and her fingers had wrinkled. When she had finished, she observed herself in the mirror with delight:  her eyes were larger and more luminous, the color more a vibrant green-hazel than the brown she had found so boring before. Her lips were fuller, her face comelier. She nearly shouted in happiness. \n\nHer parents did not notice her change. They had the gall to insist she complete her work on the farm, just as before. Infuriated, that night she drew a bath again, despite her mother’s admonition against such an extravagance. This time, she emerged from the bath even more beautiful than before, so beautiful, she thought, that she rivaled the witch herself. \n\nThat part in the retelling always made the witch howl with laughter.\n\nMuriel put on her best dress and stole her mother’s best coat and a pair of pearl earrings. She stole away in the night on one of her father’s horses, abandoning it just outside Clayton, the last vestige of her old farm life left behind.\n\nThere, with her newfound beauty, she soon made new friends. Among them was a man named Carl Simpson, the rakish leader of a local group of alcohol smugglers who had made a tidy fortune with their frequent excursions across the river to Ontario. Carl and Muriel fell madly in love and eloped only days after their first encounter. For several years, life was everything she dreamed of:  money, prestige, and the adoration of a handsome, powerful man.  \n\nCarl showered his wife with jewelry and furs. But his more and more frequent gifts were hiding a secret. Carl had begun an affair with another woman. In fact, his mistress gave birth to a healthy daughter, and suddenly Muriel began to doubt her decision to so lightly throw away her chance at having children. She found out about the affair, of course. It filled her with fury to imagine her husband sneaking away to another family, bouncing another woman’s child on his knee. Hate and jealous consumed her.\n\nCarl attempted to mollify his wife by booking a cottage for the weekend at Calnon’s, a pretty cottage with a lovely river view. Muriel acquiesced, but in a moment of weakness, she had packed that little glass bottle the witch had given her all those years ago. You see, she had become obsessed with the idea that her husband’s wandering eye was due to the fact she was not beautiful enough. She remembered the witch’s admonition against using the bath salts more than twice, but her desperation had reached it’s breaking point. Surely, just *one more* bath couldn’t be that bad.  \n\nThat night, while her husband dosed on the front porch, she prepared one last bath. She shook off her fine lace negligee and stepped in, being sure to soak herself from head to toe. At first, the bath was familiarly soothing, but then she began to feel itching on her hands and legs, as though she was developing a rash. She raised her hands out of the water and to her horror, large layers of skin were sloughing off, her hands were a decrepit shade of gray, as though they were rotting. She screamed and the pain intensified. All over her body, the skin was decaying, her eyes burned most of all, then finally shriveled into nothing. Her world went black, her face destroyed, her body an abomination, but still she lived, or rather existed. She crawled out of the bathtub with a terrible shriek, no longer the cry of a human woman. \n\nShe could sense her husband just beyond the door. He flung it open, calling her name, but seeing what was waiting for him inside, he shouted in terror and ran out. She crawled after him, her every movement an agony. She felt the change in air and knew she was outside. Her husband ran straight into the river and began to swim. She followed him into the water and caught his ankle. Surprised by her own strength she propelled herself forward and clamped her hands around the neck of the husband who had so wronged her. In a fit of rage, she squeezed the life out of him.\n\nCarl Simpson’s body was found weeks later, off the coast of Cape Vincent. Authorities suspected that he and his wife had been the victims of a rival gangster. Of course, her body was never found.\n\nMuriel, or the thing that was left of Muriel, crawled back to shore, her mind already warped and twisted by madness. She reached out blindly in the night, her hand finally catching on the smooth silk of an elegant shoe.\n\n‘You poor stupid thing,’ said the witch, triumphant. ‘Look what you’ve done to yourself.’  \n\nThe witch glanced at the ground around her and spotted two smooth blue marbles that were dropped by your young grandfather at play that morning. The witch blew on to the marbles and placed them in the empty eye sockets of Muriel. Muriel could see once more, the glassy, curved vision of a fish.\n\nThe witch cursed the cottage in which Muriel had disobeyed her and burdened your family with maintaining her miserable existence. The rest of the story, you know all too well.”\n\n“But why does it seem she has it out for me in particular?”\n\n“The witch would always say that The Wet Lady had an almost unlimited reservoir of hate. Her human mind has long since eroded away. Nothing is left but that jealousy which drove her to self-destruction. She saw you, a young girl, full of hope and brightness and wanted to destroy you. She saw you again as a young woman, with the beauty that she had thrown away in greed. I think it’s that simple.”\n\nJake sat back and sighed. It was hard for me to imagine The Wet Lady as anything more than my childhood bogeyman. And yet at one time she had been a human with hopes for the future, however misguided. \n\n“We have to end it, Jake. We have to end it tonight.”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“I’m all ears.”\n\n“Good, because I think I have a plan.”\n\n\\++\n\nRené emerged from the bedroom as soon as the sun dipped below the horizon. To my astonishment, his brown hair was long, hanging just at his shoulders. My face must have registered my surprise because he began to look concerned.\n\n“Your hair!  It’s… it’s…”\n\nA look of recognition came over him and he laughed, slightly embarrassed.\n\n“Ah, yes. Men did not have short hair in the eighteenth century. I am and will always be, exactly how I was on the night I was turned.”\n\n“Are you telling me you cut your hair short *every single night*?”\n\n“Yes. Unless you like it better this way.”\n\nI politely informed him I preferred his hair shorter. He laughed and pretended to be offended.\n\n“I’ll take care of it right away, then.”\n\nI tossed him a bag of clothes I had bought earlier.\n\n“Thought you needed a slightly more reliable method of obtaining clothing other than…you know.”\n\n“Thank you. Very thoughtful.”\n\n“Also, I have to make the payment to The Wet Lady tonight. But don’t worry Jake is going to help me.” \n\nHe looked carefully at Jake, then at me. I could tell he would prefer to accompany us, but was holding back out of respect for my judgment.\n\n“I know, I know. You’ll be here in case anything goes awry.”\n\n“Took the words right out of my mouth.”\n\nAnd so, shortly afterwards, I found myself once more in front of Cottage 9, Jake just out of sight. My heartrate increased; I felt a tightening in my chest. I sloshed around the water in the bucket and deposited it on the ground with a thud. As with my previous encounter, scratching and scurrying noises from inside the cottage announced her arrival.\n\nI gripped the marbles in my hand as The Wet Lady appeared before me, devouring the fish whole. I pushed down the feeling of nausea rising in my stomach. Whereas before she was the object of my nightmares, the face that haunted me at night, now I watched the pale, blind, rotting thing before me almost impassively, an object of profound pity.\n\n“Muriel,” I said quietly, extending my hand out with the marbles in my palm. Her head jerked towards me, empty sockets focused in the direction of my voice. I was surprised she did not let out an ear-piercing shriek, instead she cocked her head as though confused. \n\n“Muriel,” I repeated. “That was your name once.” \n\nThe Wet Lady emitted a pathetic moan of recognition. For a moment, she stood facing me, and I felt the hate building inside of her, the unquenchable rage. She lunged at me, her arms outstretched, but Jake was faster. He leapt forward with a giant bucket of salt and dumped it on top of her.\n\nShe shrieked, a wretched cry of agony. Her rotting skin hissed and sizzled until it melted away to nothing. She fell to ground and I was pushed aside by a gust of something leaving the body and escaping towards the sky. The atmosphere around us lightened, the night was peaceful once more.\n\nBefore us was a set of lifeless bones.\n\nI didn’t know where Muriel would have wanted to be buried. Her parents’ farm was abandoned in the 1960s, the small family cemetery overgrown and unloved.  Her husband was buried with his people down in Oswego. And I thought that she certainly wouldn’t have wanted to be buried on the motel grounds, her place of torment for nearly a century. \n\nRené found a place on a forested hill, just outside of Clayton, the town where she had known her only happiness. He buried her there with a modest stone. We had not known when she was born or how she would have wanted her name to appear. We decided on something simple.\n\n*Muriel*\n\n*Now at peace.*\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wine_Dark_Sea_1239/)",

I mean, imagine marching up to a person you’ve never met before and telling them, “Tough luck on the fridge freezer that’s gonna crush your skull later. Nasty way to go, being pinned down under all that weight. Oh well, rest in peace.”\n\nAs a child I thought my visions were normal—that we all got them whenever someone was about to die, but nobody said anything as a common courtesy. I mean, imagine marching up to a person you’ve never met before and telling them, “Tough luck on the fridge freezer that’s gonna crush your s later. Nasty way to go, being pinned down under all that weight. Oh well, rest in peace.”\n\nThat’s why I didn't realize I was a freak until the night my parents died. There we were, driving home from the beach and singing along with the radio, when the visions showed me glass exploding inward. Another car slammed into ours like a bullet train speeding through a tunnel, then up became down then up again as we plunged over an embankment, my parents’ mangled bodies twisting in mid-air.\n\nThe second my vision ended I thrashed around in my seat. “Stop, stop, we have to get out!” I screamed.\n\nAfter she turned down the music, my mom unbuckled her belt, reached into the back, and grabbed me by the shoulders. “Ciara honey, what’s wrong?”\n\nWhat’s wrong? What’s wrong? She and Dad were about to get impaled by the fucking windshield—*that’s* what was wrong!\n\n“I don’t want you to die,” I whimpered, my heart practically beating out of my chest.\n\nShe screwed up her face. “Who says I’m gonna die?”\n\nAnd that's when it hit me: she hadn't the faintest idea her ticket just got punched. Neither of my parents did.\n\nWhile I alternated between clawing at the door handle and slamming my fists against the side window, Mom begged me to settle down. With his free arm, Dad tried helping wrangle me into place, but he couldn’t simultaneously do that *and* drive, so he eased the car to a stop.\n\nFive seconds later headlights engulfed the cabin.\n\nI woke up in a hospital bed with my left leg in a metal cylinder. When a male doctor pulled back the curtain and announced I’d become an orphan, I simply stared up at a bright halogen bulb, numb to the world.\n\nThe bad news didn’t end there. It turned out the bastard responsible for the accident sped off before the authorities arrived. “Still,” the doctor continued, smiling thinly, “with physical therapy, you’ll be able to walk again.”\n\nThe collision left me with sixteen pins in my femur, a collage of nasty scars you can still see today, and a slightly off-balance John Wayne walk. Throughout the agonising six weeks I spent in recovery, questions like ‘*could you have saved Mom and Dad by reacting sooner?’* sloshed around my brain. Their mutilated corpses haunted me from the moment nurses arrived with breakfast until the drugs dragged me into a restless sleep.\n\nAfter rehab, state officials placed me with a kind foster family who made me see a shrink, one hellbent on asking how the accident made me feel fifty times a session. I couldn’t reveal the truth—that I blamed myself for it, and simply thinking about Mom or Dad set my insides squirming. Every memory of them had become entwined with the guilt, you see.\n\nAt the end of one session, the therapist encouraged me to lead a life that would ‘make them proud’. This set me thinking: what if the visions had a purpose? What if this ‘ability’ could do some good? The people I cared about were beyond saving, obviously. But others still needed help. Isn’t that how Batman got started?\n\nFinding somebody to rescue turned out to be tougher than you’d think; for the first few weeks, I only encountered folks whose obituaries would soon read ‘died from natural causes’.\n\nBut then, after school one afternoon, some older girls strolled past my locker, triggering an especially nasty vision.\n\nI saw the blonde girl at the front trapped inside a smoke-filled room, choking on thick, black fumes. As she feebly mashed her fists against an unmovable wooden door, naked flames licked her flesh until every inch of exposed skin bubbled and boiled.\n\nRight as her eyeballs melted out of their sockets, I found myself back at the locker. I limped after the group, fast as my weak leg would allow.\n\nOn the march toward the front entrance, Blondie bragged about her family's plans to stay at their cabin in the woods that weekend. How did I convince her not to go?\n\nI waited until the group parted ways on the quad before I tapped the girl’s shoulder. She faced me.\n\n“Hey. So, umm…I heard you’re staying at a cabin this weekend?”\n\n“…Yeah.”\n\n\"I know a guy—well, I *knew* a guy—who died in one of those.” We both stayed quiet, the silence growing awkward. “It caught fire.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nShe muttered a quiet ‘freak’ as she turned away.\n\nTerrified I’d already blown my chance, I blocked her path. “It’s just, I’ve heard those things can be dangerous. Y’know, all that…*wood*.”\n\nAround us, conversations trailed off as students’ heads snapped in our direction. Blondie circled me, her green eyes wide with embarrassment, and broke into a jog. My leg muscles twanged and spasmed matching her pace. “Maybe don’t go? I mean why take the risk?”\n\n“Get away from me loser,” she shouted as she tore past the gate.\n\n“At least check the smoke detectors when you get there!” I shouted after her.\n\nThat weekend, I passed the time by staring up at my bedroom ceiling for hours on end. On Monday the principal called a special assembly, and my cheeks were drenched with tears before he even approached the podium.\n\nThe blaze took the lives of both the blonde girl and her younger sister. The school memorial attracted a massive turnout, and being surrounded by that profound outpouring of grief felt like a knife twisting between my ribs—a constant reminder I’d disappointed my parents. Again.\n\nThis made me even more determined to save the *next* life.\n\nThree weeks later at the grocery store, an opportunity came along in the form of a thin clerk about to tumble off his ladder. I bolted down the aisle, but before I’d even managed ten steps, the man’s feet wobbled from side to side. In a desperate attempt at remaining upright, he windmilled his arms around, collapsing a nearby lemonade stand.\n\nIn the end, gravity won out. The tiled floor cracked his skull like an egg, then blood and fizzy yellow liquid seeped out from beneath the corpse, mingling together.\n\nMeanwhile, I just stood there, deflated.\n\nA pattern soon emerged: the drowning girl got swept away before I could fish her out of the river; a social worker about to get stabbed flipped me off because I begged him to rush home yet couldn’t explain why; and the paramedics failed at resuscitating the elderly man suffering a heart attack on the park bench even though, thanks to me, they arrived ten seconds after he started clutching his own chest.\n\nNo matter what I did, no matter how hard I tried, the visions always came to pass. Always. When I barely winced at a cashier about to get shot in the face over the meagre change in his register, it became painfully obvious I’d lost all hope. Sorry Mom, sorry Dad. Turns out my ‘gift’ couldn't benefit others.\n\nFast forward fifteen years. By the time my thirties reared their ugly head, I’d launched a decent IT career and paid off a cosy apartment. Years of physical therapy had left my limp almost unnoticeable, although if I stood around too long pins and needles still went racing along my thigh.\n\nThose guilt pangs over my parents’ deaths never subsided and, as a result, I avoided large crowds and gatherings on account of all the soon-to-be corpses.\n\nUntil a bizarre vision changed everything...\n\nIt was the twentieth anniversary of the accident, and I’d slipped into a sports bar to perform my yearly ritual of drowning gruesome images from the collision in a shot glass.\n\nBut no sooner had I found a quiet seat in the corner when a suited man approached my table and said, “Hey baby doll.”\n\nHis appearance triggered a vision, which surprised me. This guy clearly looked after himself and couldn’t have been any older than forty; typically, people fitting that description bit the dust in strange and unusual ways. Maybe he had an undiagnosed lung condition? Or a jaded ex hungry for revenge?\n\nMy vision didn’t reveal either of those things. Instead, it showed him on his knees in a windowless room beside a leather sofa, blood gushing from his neck like water from a spout. With a liquid gurgle, he pawed at his own throat and then slumped face-down onto a diamond-patterned rug, feet twitching.\n\nAnd standing over him, slaughtering knife in hand, was…me.\n\nBack in the bar, my hands clung onto the table. Who was this guy? Where did the encounter take place? And why the hell would I kill somebody?\n\nA sensible voice in the back of my mind told me to walk away—to bolt straight out the door. If anybody else tried that ‘baby doll’ line they’d have received a rude gesture in response.\n\nBut I needed answers. So I forced a smile and looked up.\n\n“Buy you a drink?” the man asked, one eyebrow raised.\n\nPeter had a slender nose, brown hair, and dark eyes. A handsome guy, no doubt. He worked as a lawyer—youngest partner in his firm’s history—and his favorite subject was…himself. That suited me. I gave him a fake name which he probably forgot ten seconds later.\n\n“You look familiar,” he said after his third whiskey. “Have we met before?”\n\n“Don’t think so.”\n\n“Must be thinking of someone else.”\n\nWhile he joked with the regulars and announced ‘another round on me’ to a chorus of cheers, I studied his every move, half-expecting his taste in beer or how generously he tipped to reveal why he deserved a death sentence.\n\n“Wanna come back to my place?” he asked when the bartender called last round.\n\nI should have made up some half-assed excuse and slipped away, but there had to be some vital information I’d missed. Maybe Peter moonlighted as a serial killer? If so, didn’t I have an obligation to investigate?\n\nNow intoxicated, he drove us over to his place in a fancy blue Porsche. The plan was simple: stick around long enough to discover whatever dark secret he harboured, then leave. No matter what. If anything suspicious turned up, I’d notify the police. That way, there’d be zero risk of any trouble.\n\nAfter all, how hard could *not* slitting somebody’s throat be?\n\nPeter led me along the front hall and down a narrow staircase. As the basement door swung open, a yelp slid up my throat.\n\nWe’d entered the room from the vision. Maybe I’d come to meet my destiny.\n\nPlacing a hand against my back, Peter steered me past the diamond-patterned rug, toward a home bar cast in warm red light by a neon Budweiser sign. From beneath the counter, he grabbed a chopping board and a sharp kitchen knife—the same one future me butchered him with. My eyes stayed glued to the blade while he cut lime slices and poured out tequila shots.\n\nWe had a toast before moving to the fancy leather sofa where my companion pounded back beer after beer. I nursed mine, staying sober and in control.\n\nHe managed an entire hour of shameless boasting before his head slumped forward against his chest.\n\nThe pieces had all fallen into place: the knife, the rug, the defenseless victim. Yet I saw zero reason to hurt Peter. It’s a miracle my giant sigh of relief didn’t startle him awake.\n\nTake that, dumb visions. You lost. It was time to leave.\n\nHowever. A quick look around couldn’t have hurt anybody, could it?\n\nThere was no hidden torture chamber behind the bookshelf, just guides on the art of seduction, and the freezer didn't harbour any severed heads, only frozen salmon and shrimp.\n\nIn a cramped office on the first floor, I rummaged through desk drawers, and right when it felt like this had all been a gigantic waste of time, my eye happened across a pile of newspaper clippings. The first headline read, TWO DEAD IN HIGHWAY HIT AND RUN. Beside it was a familiar image: the wreckage my parents died in…\n\nMy hands frantically tore through the pile. In total, Peter had collected seventeen articles about the collision and subsequent investigation. Beneath them, there sat an envelope with a name scribbled across the front. *My* name.\n\nA sensible voice in some quiet recess of my brain begged me to walk away—to forget what I’d seen and go.\n\nI waved the thought aside, took a slow, steady breath, and tore open the wrapper.\n\nThe letter began with:\n\n*Dear Ciara, there is something I must confess. On the night of your parent’s death, I was driving drunk along...*\n\nThose words dragged me back to the accident, caused me to relive the sensation of the seatbelt pinning me in place while Mom and Dad’s bodies ricocheted off the dashboard, the roof.\n\nPeter killed my parents. I’d found his confession.\n\nThe letter explained how he’d avoided prison; since he stemmed from a wealthy family—his father had been mayor at the time—some powerful friends torpedoed the investigation. He heard I’d survived and considered reaching out over the years. The poor guy even spent ‘countless nights’ agonizing over what happened and felt ‘filled to bursting point with regret’.\n\nClearly, not quite 'full' enough to mail the letter. He’d written it to clear his conscience, nothing more.\n\nIn an almost trance-like state, I returned to the basement.\n\nPeter snored away on the sofa. Only vaguely aware of my own actions, I circled the bar, grabbed the knife, and positioned myself behind my parents’ murderer. His foul whiskey breaths fogged up the blade.\n\nMy hands started trembling. Did I really want to go through with this? Did he really deserve to die? Is it what Mom and Dad would have wanted?\n\nI quietened the bickering voices, closed my eyes, and took a slow, steady breath.\n\nNo. Two wrongs would *not* make a right. Better to take the letter and report the son of a bitch. Would this accomplish much? Unlikely. It sure beat the alternative, though.\n\nI started toward the door.\n\nI'd taken less than five steps when Peter stirred. “Hey, you’re not leaving alre—what’s that?”\n\nBy the time I spun around, he’d already found his feet. Those brown eyes whipped between me and the letter. “Why have…where did…”\n\nOf all the potential excuses that came to me, zero made sense. When it finally dawned on Peter where he recognized me from earlier, his face turned whiter than the paper confession, his mouth going wide with shock. Most likely he saw a resemblance to an old family photo published after the accident.\n\nHis hands shot up in a submissive gesture. “Okay. Calm down.”\n\nHolding the knife out defensively, I snorted a quick, “Fuck you.” The nerves in my leg went wild with terrible, burning sensations.\n\nWhile I shuffled backward toward the stairs, Peter said, “Listen…Ciara, there isn’t a day goes by—\"\n\n“Don’t. Don’t you fucking dare.”\n\nHe swallowed a lump. “I’ll make this right, I promise. Why don’t you put the knife down and we’ll talk?”\n\nThe suggestion this could get 'talked out' made me snort. I said, “Go fuck yourself. I’m taking the letter. Along with your little scrapbook upstairs.”\n\n“Was this your plan all along?” he demanded, his self-pity giving way to anger. “Get me drunk then snoop around? How long have you been planning your little heist?”\n\nStill traveling in reverse, I cut the air, forced him a half-step back. The knife felt good in my hand. Powerful.\n\n“Don’t be stupid. None of this would hold up in court. Give me the knife, then we can work things out like two—”\n\nCompletely terrified and barely able to form a cohesive thought, I *almost* obliged. Until a horrible image of the bastard picking his bruised, swollen head up off a steering wheel slid into my brain. I pictured him slowly uncover my parents insides spread out across twenty metres of asphalt before racing home to call his dad, who called the chief of police…\n\n“—rationale adults. I…I’ll give you money. Or jewellery. A new car? Whatever you want, just—”\n\nWith renewed confidence, I said, “The only thing I want, Peter, is to see you in an orange fucking jumpsuit.”\n\nMy heel hit the bottom step. In the brief moment my eyes flicked backward, the bastard lunged.\n\n“I’ll fucking kill you,” he hissed through clenched teeth.\n\nHis hands clamped around my wrists, tight enough the fingertips plunged into the skin. We wrestled around the room, collapsing shelves and slamming against the bar once, twice. My parents’ smiling faces flashed before my eyes, accompanied by thoughts about how this might be the final time I’d ever disappoint them. After he murdered me Peter would no doubt call his father, who’d hire two goons to dump the body…\n\nBoth of us flew sideways on a collision course with the sofa. For a moment the world flushed upside down. We hit the floor, hard, the knife landing mid-way between us on the rug. We fumbled for it, me shaking from the panic and adrenaline, him struggling to regain equilibrium.\n\nIn one smooth movement I snatched the blade beyond the bastard’s reach, readjusted my grip, and then plunged the pointy end into his throat. As my hand yanked it loose, the thin blood trickle morphed into a furious spray. Some even got inside my mouth, disgustingly warm.\n\nPeter tried to speak although no words came out. Only a pathetic, wet gurgle. He flopped forward, tongue draped over his chin. And just like that I found myself standing over a corpse.\n\nIn retrospect, it probably shouldn’t have come as such a surprise.\n\nRepulsed by my red palms, I retreated toward the bar and slid to the floor, breathless. I began convulsing, rocked myself back and forth, bile sliding up my throat. I felt ill, and not only from the tequila.\n\nBy the time I’d regained composure, a clock above the bar said 6 AM. Somebody could have walked in at any moment. There'd be time for remorse later. First, I needed to cover my tracks.\n\nUnder my feet the rug, having absorbed most of the blood, squelched as I raced around wiping down every surface. After gathering together all articles about the accident, I departed on foot and ditched the knife in a dumpster several miles from the crime scene, then I rushed home to read the confession once more before burning it, along with Peter’s treasure trove of misery.\n\nThe next few days passed in a whirlwind of alcohol and tears. As a politician’s son, my victim made the front page; authorities appealed for anybody with information to come forward.\n\nFunny how Mom and Dad never warranted such special consideration…\n\nAfter two weeks of rage, regret, and hysteria, I’d almost reached the point of confession. Until something unexpected happened, that is.\n\nReports emerged of multiple drunk driving incidents involving Peter where the injured parties got paid off or threatened into silence, along with more assault allegations reporters could keep up with. Turns out, Daddy had been buying that slimeball out of trouble for two decades.\n\nGradually, the guilt haze looming over me since the night my parents died evaporated. The visions no longer felt like a burden—they were a blessing. One that dispensed justice.\n\nAfter the investigation wound down and people lost interest in the story, I treated myself with a celebratory trip to the beach. All those happy families reminded me of my parent’s final day, when Dad and I spent hours building a huge sandcastle with its own drawbridge, Mom sunbathing nearby.\n\nWhile I stood ankle-deep in the water, lost in thought, a mother shuffled past carrying her infant daughter. A dishevelled man trailed after them, far enough away so as not to appear suspicious.\n\nThere came another vision. In it, the mother and child sat back-to-back, tied up together in a bug-infested apartment, their jaws encased with duct tape.\n\nThe grinning man hunched over them, his right hand caressing the terrified girl’s cheek.\n\nA baseball bat connected suddenly with the back of his skull, which made him faceplant onto the wooden floor with a resounding thud.\n\nI’ll give you three guesses who took that swing…\n\nBack on the beach, I watched all three disappear along the coastal path, conflicted. Going after them meant playing right into the vision’s hands, not to mention cutting my celebration short.\n\nBut then again, [could I really pass up another opportunity to make my parents proud?](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)",

        "text": "  \n\nCollege was an agonizing three years for me. I was too lazy to sit down and study, so I was the guy who furiously turned the pages in his notebook with deep desperation in his eyes, trying to absorb as much information as he could before the exams. I knew I had to get a grip on myself sometime soon and learn to study, or else I would fail miserably. But that wasn’t the case. Barely passing all my subjects, last summer I obtained my degree. Now, past the three worst years of my life, I was ready to hunt down a well-paying job and start my independent, adult life.\n\nTwo months later, I was in my shitty car, a suitcase with all my stuff in the back seat, ready to move back to my mother. Unable to find a job, I struggled with rent, so I had to make an embarrassing call to my mom asking for help. I couldn't ask for money, of course, but I asked her if I could stay with her for a while just until I found a job and could afford rent. She agreed immediately and it seemed to me from her tone of voice that she was happy to have some company.\n\nShe has been all alone since my dad died almost two years ago. I didn’t have any siblings, and most of our relatives lived too far for frequent visits. When my father died, I promised to visit her often, seeing how lost she was without him. Unfortunately, that ceased after just a few occasions. I was always angry at myself when I postponed it but not too much to make the trip after all. Now we could spend all our time together, not that it could make up for my lack of visits.\n\nIt was well in the afternoon when I arrived. I pulled up the driveway, got my luggage, and headed inside. I entered the front door and stopped just taking in the sight of my childhood home, which I hadn’t seen in almost two years. It wasn’t all that long ago, but I felt a sense of nostalgia. I let go of my bag, which landed on the wooden floor with a heavy thud, wondering where mom could be. I made my way to the living room, where I found her sitting in an armchair looking at the tv.\n\n“Hey mom, I’m home.” – I announced my arrival. I glanced at the tv, walking towards her, interested in what she was watching so immersed she didn’t even hear me enter the house. The tv, however, showed a blank screen. Finally, she seemed to notice me as she stood up, turning her attention to me. She seemed preoccupied as she gave me a weak hug and said hi.\n\n“Hey, your voice’s a little raspy. You’re not sick, are you?” – I asked, a little concerned. She reassured me that everything was okay, and she was as healthy as ever. As I went up to my room to unpack, she went to the kitchen and prepared dinner. I told her it wasn’t necessary, and that she could just rest but she insisted. Putting away my belongings shouldn’t have taken long, but something from my old bedroom distracted me every five minutes. Every time I found something I sat down with it remembering the good times as if they happened a long time ago and not just a few years ago. As I sat down with a picture that showed me and my parents at my 10th birthday party, I felt an odd sensation. I could have sworn someone was watching me. The feeling was so strong I could almost feel the gaze on my back. I looked around the room trying to calm down myself. It was a pretty stressful time in my life, and it seemed my brain started to tire. I considered skipping dinner and going to sleep but I didn’t want mom’s work to go to waste. And I had one other thing to do while I waited. I sat down at my desk and picked up my phone.\n\n“Hey man, what’s up? – Danny spoke. Danny was my best friend. We met in elementary school and as the two troublemakers in class, we quickly bonded in detention. People always told me these early friendships were never lasting, but our friendship was as strong as ever nearly two decades later. “Hey, guess who’s back in town?” – I asked. “No way! Mr. big shot engineer finally showed his face again huh?\n\n“Shut up, okay? I’m a bit lost at the moment.”\n\n“So what? You need me to jump in and save the day? You know I’m ready.” – He laughed.\n\n“No, it’s cool. I just wanted to see if you were free some time to hang out or something” – As our conversation continued, I was nonchalantly spinning with my chair looking at nothing in particular when I noticed my door. In the gap of the slightly ajar door was my mother’s face. She was looking right at me. As our eyes met, she quickly disappeared. Being so weirded out I was probably silent for some time as the yells of Danny were what took me back. Quickly ending our discussion, I went downstairs. It was pretty weird but I surely overreacted. She probably came to get me down for dinner but didn’t want to disturb me while I was on the phone. Probably.\n\nAs I was walking to the dining table, I asked her about it. She pretended like she had no idea what I was talking about. Now it was really weird. Looking down and glancing at my dinner made everything much more bizarre. My mom allegedly cooked for hours and on my plate, there were simple scrambled eggs. Scrambled eggs with shells in them. Mother wasn’t a world-famous chef or anything, but she wouldn’t make a mistake like this. Something was wrong. Now, I was sure. While I thought about how to bring up the topic again, I hunted down the parts without shells in them. When I finally knew what to say to her, I was shot down almost immediately. I finally told her to go rest a bit while I wash the dishes. Feeling lost, and uneasy, I decided to turn in for the night. On my way to my room, I said goodnight to mom who was once again sitting in front of the turned-off tv.\n\nThe next day I woke up at noon. I was really tired if I managed to sleep fifteen hours. I was going to meet Dan today. I didn’t set an alarm, because how could I be late for a meeting that was at one pm? Well, I almost managed to do it. After I was ready, I searched for my mom to tell her I’m off. When I finally arrived at the café, we agreed to meet at, Dan had already ordered two coffees for us. Sitting down I made my excuses which he ignored and asked how I was. Time passed quickly as we talked. We had much to catch up on. After we were caught up on each other’s life, we fell silent for a while.\n\n“So. What’s wrong?” – Dan asked.\n\n“What do you mean?” – I answered with a question between two sips of my coffee.\n\n“You have this worried expression. You look like shit, to be honest.” – he chuckled. – “You can tell me you know”.\n\n“I’m a little worried about mom. It’s nothing serious. Or at least I’d like to think it’s not.” – I confessed.\n\n“Is she ill or something?” – Now he too, had a look of concern on his face.\n\n“Yeah, I think so. It’s nothing concrete. She just really seems disorientated. Like she’s confused all the time. I found her watching tv when I arrived. But it was turned off. I also caught her spying on me and when I confronted her, she pretended like she didn’t know what I was talking about.”\n\n“Woah, that’s a little weird, but I’m not sure that means she’s ill. Everyone has these kinds of days When you’re just spaced out throughout the day. But if you’re that worried take her to a doctor.”\n\n“But that’s the thing. She refuses to see a doctor. I just don’t know what to do. She gets so angry when I mention it.”\n\n“Look. What if you’re right? What’s worse? Her being upset with you because you forced her to see a doctor or her condition worsening because she didn’t get treatment in time?”\n\n“You’re right” – I admitted.\n\n“As always” – he smiled.\n\n“I’ll talk to her when I get home, and tomorrow I’ll take her to the doctor even if a have to drag her away.\n\nThe sun was already going down when we said our goodbyes. I told him I’ll text him about how it went with mom and went home. Dan was right. I didn’t care if she would be angry. What mattered was her health. There was no time to waste. As soon as I got home, I was determined to convince her it was in her best interest to seek help. I found her in the living room. She was standing in front of the tv, just looking at it silently.\n\n“What are you doing mom?” – I asked in a worried voice.\n\n“Oh, I’m just watching tv, son.” – she said as she turned to me. She only turned her neck, her body still facing the tv.\n\n“But it’s not even on.”\n\n“Oh, is that so? I didn’t realize.” – she spoke without any emotion. It was scary to see her like this.\n\n“Mom, you have to admit, there’s something wrong. Please just let me take you to a doc…” – Her expression turned into anger so quickly I couldn’t finish my sentence. She screamed at me.\n\n“NO! I already told you, there’s nothing wrong. Just leave me alone.” – With that, she walked towards the front door.\n\n“Please wait mom.” – I said as I grabbed her arm. There was something seriously wrong with her. She needed urgent help; I couldn’t just let her go. Strangely though, I couldn’t stop her. She pulled me along for a few steps as I tried to stop her with more and more power. She finally stopped and looked back at me. Her eyes were so full of anger it honestly creeped me out. She escaped from my hold and stormed out the door.\n\nI called her dozens of times and left voicemails and texts, but no response. I was hoping she was at a friend, trying to calm down. Something was bothering me though. When she pulled away from my hold. Her skin was loose. I didn’t know how else to describe it. When she pulled away it was like her arm was moving but her skin remained in my hand. Like it was not attached to her or something. I told myself I was just imagining it. It was already a weird situation, and my mind just made it up. I went to sleep assuming she would be home by morning.\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night. I had this terrible feeling that I wasn’t alone. As I picked up my phone, I saw that it was almost 1 am. I turned on the flash to look around the room. As the light shone on the open door I panicked. I always closed the bedroom door before sleep.\n\n“M-Mom?” – I stuttered. I wished she would answer me, confirming it was her, but the silence remained. I didn’t move. Even if I wanted to I couldn’t. After a few silent seconds, something moved. A hand appeared on the wall. It was followed by a face. It was my mother’s. she peeked into the room looking right at me. I wanted to say something, but nothing came. I was petrified. Her mouth slowly stretched into a grin. At that moment, I was sure. Whoever or whatever was standing at the door was not my mother. I hadn’t seen my mother since I came home.\n\n“Don’t worry son.” – her words pulled me back to the moment. – “Just go back to sleep. Mom’s here.”\n\nI was so scared I felt like I could die. She probably saw it on my face as she started giggling. As slowly as she appeared she disappeared behind the wall, but I didn’t hear any footsteps. I was too scared to move but I had to. I had to at least close the door before she came back. I wasn’t sure if she would only talk the second time around. It took some time, but I convinced myself to go. I ran to the door slamming it shut. I pushed the dresser in front of it and sat down against it. I sat there the whole night without sleeping.\n\nThe next day I went to the police and reported my mother missing. I only told them that we had an argument which ended in her leaving, and I haven’t seen her since. I couldn’t tell them about the thing that looked like her, I didn’t want to be seen as crazy.\n\nI didn’t want to go back to the house. But where could I have gone? I started applying to every job listing I found determined to get out as soon as possible. I prayed that for the time I had to spend in that house she – or rather, it - wouldn’t come back. My prayers fell on deaf ears though. The thing visited me every day and always made sure I would know. Items were misplaced, and sometimes I would find the back door open or there would be dirty footprints on the floor. But the scariest ones were the messages. I found them scratched into the wallpaper from time to time. They were all along the lines of how it misses me, and that it would come back to me soon.\n\nSadly, as time passed, she became bolder. She came when I was awake. I heard footsteps behind me and found new messages while I was home. She would often knock on the doors and windows. I felt like it was constantly watching me. I couldn’t sleep at all. I was too terrified. I was slowly going insane.\n\nThe last incident happened a week before I moved out. I came home from work. I was beyond exhausted. Work was hard and I didn’t sleep for the past two days. I sat down on the couch and promptly fell asleep. When I woke up the sun was already setting. I just sat there trying to cheer myself up telling myself I could rent a place soon. That’s when I felt it. A strange warm feeling on the top of my head. Like someone was breathing down on me. I looked up.\n\nThere I could see something looking down at me with joy in its eyes. Its eyes were terrifying, like a wild animal’s, its skin was like the whole body was badly burned a while ago and now scar tissues covered it. I could only see the face through something that hung from its head. It was like a rubber mask that melted and stretched out. When I tried to focus on it, I recognized my mother’s face. Tears welled up in my eyes as I jumped up and faced the thing. I saw a smile behind the skin it wore as a mask. It spread out its arms.\n\n“Give your mother a hug.” – it said. I started backing up towards the kitchen.\n\n“What’s wrong son? Can’t you recognize your mother?” – at this point I was crying. Not only from fear but also cried for my mom. I already knew she was dead, but it was like a dream up until now. A long, terrible nightmare.\n\nThe smile disappeared from its face suddenly. It leaped at me. I ran into the kitchen, ripped open a drawer, and picked up a knife. I only had time to turn around as the thing crashed into me. And right into the knife as well. With a puzzled look on its face, it moved back a few steps. It let out a horrifying shriek as it grabbed the knife. I didn’t wait any longer, I ran out the back door and went for the car. Luckily, I still had my keys in my pocket. I didn’t stop until I was out of town. Pulling over I just cried until I fell asleep behind the wheel.\n\nI crashed at Dan until I found a place to stay. When I found one cheap enough to afford, I went back to that house once more. I collected my stuff, often looking behind me, scared that I would see the thing running at me. When I finished, I went to the kitchen. I saw a trail of dried blood leading to the open back door. And there was something else in the kitchen. In a heap on the kitchen floor, there were big chunks of something rotting away. It was human skin.",

        "text": "It started with a strange noise in the walls. At first, I didn't pay it much attention. After all, I had just moved into this old house and I assumed it was just the normal sounds of an old building settling in. But as the nights went on, the noises became more and more persistent. It sounded like something scratching at the walls, as if trying to claw its way through.\n\nI tried to ignore it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. One night, I woke up to a tapping sound coming from the window. When I looked outside, I saw a shadowy figure standing in the yard, staring up at me. I couldn't make out any details, but I could feel its eyes on me, watching me.\n\nThe next day, I called a local handyman to take a look at the walls. He didn't find anything unusual, but as he was leaving, he warned me to be careful in this house. He said he had heard stories about strange happenings here, and that I should keep my eyes and ears open.\n\nAs the days went on, the strange occurrences continued. Objects would move on their own, and I would hear footsteps in the hallway when I was alone. I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination, but I knew deep down that something was wrong.\n\nThen, one night, I woke up to find the shadowy figure standing at the foot of my bed. It was darker than the darkness around it, and I could feel its eyes on me once again. I tried to scream, but my voice was stuck in my throat. I couldn't move, couldn't even blink.\n\nThe figure leaned in closer, and I could feel its breath on my face. It whispered something, but I couldn't make out the words. Then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, it vanished into thin air.\n\nThe next day, I decided to do some research on the house. I found out that it had once belonged to a wealthy family who had all died under mysterious circumstances. The father had gone insane and murdered his wife and children before killing himself. No one had lived in the house since then.\n\nThat night, I was awoken by the sound of scratching in the walls again. But this time, I knew what it was. It was the sound of the father trying to claw his way out of the afterlife and into our world. And I knew that he would never stop until he had claimed me as his next victim.\n\nI tried to leave the house, but I couldn't. Every time I tried to pack my things and run, something held me back. It was as if the house had a grip on me, and it wouldn't let me go.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, I began to lose track of time. I didn't eat, I didn't sleep, I just sat in my room and waited for the ghost to come back. And he always did.\n\nOne night, as I was sitting in the darkness, I heard a voice. It was the voice of the father, and he was telling me his story. He had been a wealthy man, but he had lost everything in the stock market crash of 1929. His wife had left him, taking their children with her. He had become obsessed with the idea of getting them back, even if it meant killing them.\n\nAs he spoke, I could feel his anger and his pain. And I realized that he wasn't just a vengeful ghost seeking revenge. He was a broken man, trapped in this house just as I was.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, everything went quiet. The scratching stopped, the footsteps faded away, and the father's voice trailed off into nothingness.\n\nFor a moment, I was relieved. It was over. But then I heard a new sound. It was a sound that chilled me to my very core. It was the sound of a child's laughter.\n\nI looked around, but I was alone in the darkness. The laughter grew louder, and I realized that it was coming from inside me. The father had found a way inside my mind, and he was taking control.\n\nI tried to fight it, but it was too late. I was no longer myself. I was the father, consumed by anger and pain. And I knew that I would never leave this house. I would be trapped here forever, just like he was.\n\nNow, I am the one scratching at the walls, trying to claw my way out of this afterlife and into the world of the living. And I will never stop until I have claimed my next victim.\n\nSo if you ever find yourself in an old, creaky house with strange noises in the walls, be warned. It might not be the house that's haunted. It might be you.",

        "text": "update. i saw some advice on my last post telling me to pray or use blessed water. my mum is very religious and has holy water in every room in the house. so i grabbed the holy water from the cabinet above the sink and started to pray and prepare myself to fight that creature.\n\nAs i was preparing myself the bathroom door started to thud. then it started to splinter so i knew i had been found. I decided i would use a small amount on its leg first or whatever that things is walking on to see how well it would work. once i saw a bit of its leg poking through i put some of the holy water on my finger tips and splashed it towards its leg. Thats when i heard it scream. It sounded like if a dying horse and a dying cat came together with a dying pigeon to form an awful rock band. Thats how i knew it would actually work. Although i didnt have enough, i could try blessing a mop bucket full of water. So thats what i did. i filled the mop bucket up with fresh, unbleached water and i tried to bless it. I did have to watch a few videos with the little of my remaining data and i blessed it. All i had to do now was wait until it came back to try it.\n\nA few minutes later, after it healed i assume, it returned, still trying to get in. once i saw a clear shot i dipped my hand in the water i had blessed and flicked it, hoping it would work and it did. i felt and still feel so relieved that my efforts worked. \n\nI decided now was my chance to try and end this living nightmare forever. I gave my self a short speech, grabbed the mop bucket and walked to the door. As i opened it, i saw the mess it had made and my mum, unconscious behind the couch, that seemed to be on her. This thing had terrorized me and hurt my mother as well. Thats when i heard it speak again, it sounded like it was chanting something or performing a spell to heal where it had been blessed. \n\nI inched towards it as it was distracted. My heart racing, body sweating and my hairs on edge. i held the handle of the bucket with my left arm, grabbed the bottom of the bucket with my right arm and threw the water towards it.\n\nthe water splashed onto its red, blood dripping and generally disturbing body and started to sizzle. The sound it made was worse than the last. It started to melt, like the wicked witch from the wizard of Oz when dorothy threw the water onto her to save the people and creatures in that weird world. \n\nafter a couple of minutes, it was just a blob on the floor with that boys face. I cleaned it all up into separate jars to make sure it could never return, just in case. \n\nonce i had nearly completely calmed down i remembered that my mum was still unconscious on the living room floor and called for an ambulance. Once they had arrived and got my mum into the ambulance, i entered my bedroom and looked at the now ominous notebook i had nearly forgotten about. Thats brings us again, to now. \n\nI'm sitting at my desk and staring at the notebook. I'm going to lock it up in a glass case or something. maybe get the case blessed. I might need a priest or someone who'll be able to move it without summoning that things brother or sister. All i know is that there is no point in trying to get rid of it. It will always return. I'm going to visit the hospital now while i wait for my mum to get out of surgery. Just remember if you ever see a notebook that had no label and looks creepy, weird, out of place or odd. Do not touch it. simply ignore it and hope it doesnt follow you.",

        "text": "I've always been a devoted cat parent, and I'll do anything to ensure my feline friend is well-fed and happy. So, when I discovered that the local pet food store was selling chicken livers at a bargain price, I couldn't resist.\n\nI brought the chicken liver home, and my cat couldn't get enough of it. She devoured it, purring with pleasure, and I felt like a responsible pet owner. But then, things started to get weird.\n\nOne night, I woke up to the sound of my cat meowing loudly. I stumbled out of bed and made my way to the kitchen, thinking she was hungry. But as soon as I opened the fridge, I realized something was off.\n\nThe chicken liver was gone, but in its place was something that looked like a liver, but it definitely wasn't chicken. It was too big to be a chicken liver, and it had an odd texture that I couldn't place. Suddenly, a wave of nausea hit me as I realized what it could be.\n\nI had heard rumors about the pet food industry, and how some unscrupulous companies used animal byproducts in their products. I started to wonder if the liver I had given my cat wasn't chicken after all, but something far more sinister.\n\nI immediately called the pet food store and demanded to know where they sourced their chicken livers. But when I asked, they became evasive, and I knew something was wrong.\n\nOver the next few days, my cat became lethargic and wouldn't eat anything, not even her favorite treats. She would just stare at me with big, scared eyes, and I knew something was seriously wrong. I kept serious watch over the next few days and she seemed to be doing fine until......\n\nI suddenly noticed a change in her behavior. She became more aggressive and started wanting to eat my food. Every time I ate, she would go feral over my meals and snacks. I couldn't enjoy anything in peace, and it was starting to become a real problem. \n\nI decided to take her to the vet to see if anything was wrong. The vet gave her a thorough examination and told me that everything seemed to be okay, but they would run some blood tests just to be sure.\n\nMy heart raced as I answered the phone call from the vet's office. The voice on the other end sounded agitated, and I could feel a sense of dread rising within me. \"Is your cat around by any chance?\" the voice asked urgently.\n\nI replied with a shaky \"Yes,\" wondering what could have gone wrong. But then, I heard lots of static on the other end of the line. I strained to hear what the person was saying, but all I could make out was the shocking phrase, \"Blood indicates it's human.\".\n\nMy mind reeled with confusion and fear. What could that possibly mean? My thoughts drifted to the takeout I had been ordering for my cat and the stacks of bags and boxes in the trash that has accumulated overtime. I fear I'm being an irrresponsible pet owner but my cat seems happy and content. ADVICE NEEDED",

        "text": "Hello r/nosleep community. I saw that this was a subreddit with a lot of people (I didn’t realize that so many redditors didn’t sleep well, though it makes sense in retrospect LOL). I am hoping that at least a few of you guys will understand what I am struggling with.\n\nA few weeks ago, one of my neighbors started mowing his lawn every night. For context, I live in a pretty sparse neighborhood, with only a few houses near mine. He has one of these big rideable mowers that is absurdle loud, the ones they have at the front of the Tractor Supply. Now, he used to mow his lawn at night every now and then, and that was fine. I can go the occasional night without sleep, and often did. However, I have not slept for weeks now. I nap during the day, but it is not the same. \n\nI’m pissed, but not very confrontational, so I went over to his house to politely ask him to stop, and he said that he couldn’t mow during the day because he would be at work. He also said that he mowed so much because it took his mind off of his wife, who had apparently  gone missing a week or so before. I’ll admit, I don’t talk to my neighbors much. I guess we all have our own methods of grieving, and it seems to be really effective for him. He also said that the grass gets uneven if he doesn’t mow it often, so maybe he just has OCD. He did have to leave for a couple days for a business trip once. I confirmed that the grass is uneven when he doesn’t mow it during the couple of hours I didn’t take the opportunity to sleep.  \n\nI thought of a couple solutions, but they might be dumb. One, maybe I can get him a scythe. The scythe can cut the grass quietly, and he already has a few tools, so he clearly doesn’t mind using his hands. Plus, he has to run through so much fuel; I couldn’t afford the fuel that he has been using. However, I don’t want to seem weird or creepy for suggesting a scythe. I did suggest that he put some stones over the uneven grass to cover it up as well, but he said that that would make the uneven grass more obvious somehow? I have also tried some basic sleep medicine, but his mower is too loud. Pillow over the ears didn’t work either. I ordered a pair of noise cancelling headphones, but they’ll take a few days to get here.\n\nI don’t want to stop someone from grieving over their loved one, or taking care of their lawn, but I cannot sleep at all. He is pissing me off. This has affected my performance at work. The only reason that I have not been fired is because I already told my boss this. Does anyone know what I can do in order to sleep again? Thank you guys very much in advance! 🙂",

        "text": "\n\n  \n\nThe name’s Rudy, Rudy Reid. I woke up in this hard sort of thing. Last thing I remember I was driving home after a long day at the university. I must’ve gotten home and fallen asleep. But right now I didn’t know where I was, then again I did have a habit of falling asleep in strange places, me mum said it’s been on since I was a bed wetter. \n\nI got out of my box and walked outside where I saw a few people, scared to be seen with my bed hair I slipped to the side and escaped their view. It seems like I was at a party of sorts, well at least that’s what I thought… There was a buffet set up with all of my favorite things! There was pasta and pizza and even ice cream! I poured myself a glass of champagne, that’s when I first noticed I was suited up. I was wearing a white suit and for some reason my skin looked a little wrinkly… Must’ve forgotten to put cream before coming I reckon. \n\nI took a sip of the champagne but it tasted absolutely terrible for some reason. To clean up my mouth after that terrible drink I decided to have a little bit of water. \n\nYuck!\n\nHow does one manage to make water taste this BAD? Finally, I went outside to let the sun hit me a bit, you know, wake myself up. I closed my eyes as the sun rays hit my wrinkly skin. I suddenly heard a glass break. I opened my eyes and quickly diverted my attention to the site of the accident. That’s where I saw my mom, glaring at me in shock. It must’ve been because of my bedhead... I decided to apologize and tell her I’d fix it right away “Mum I’m sorry I was just so tired, one of those days you know? I’ll fix it rig-“ my breath froze as I looked to the sign beside my mom. ‘Rudy’s funeral. Saying goodbye to Rudy.’\n\nWhat in the-? Obviously, this little incident left me extremely confused. I couldn’t process what was going on and just ran. I didn’t know where I was running but I saw the bathrooms and decided to go there. That’s when I felt something in me mouth, a sweet, yet salty kind of thing. It was forcing itself upward and eventually I spit something that looked like a piece of paper on my hand, and as I read the clearly handwritten note, the situation I put myself into finally dawned upon me.\n\n|\n\n|\n\nRULES: RULES TO SURVIVE AS AN UNDEAD.\n\nHey there! Looks like you’re the latest addition to the undead. This note has been designed to automatically show up in the hands of an undead 15 minutes after they first show up. so with no further ado, let’s get right into the rules.\n\n1) You are undead. You cannot die. As you can see, you’re clearly breathing….But here’s the thing, you’re going to stay alive. For reasons inexplicable by current science, your body has stopped aging, and you are stuck this way forever.\n\n2) Though you cannot die, do note that you are not immortal. You still bleed and wound. And it will hurt worse than ever before.\n\n3) Every seventh day you must kill at least 1 person and commit acts of cannibalism. You are not dead, but you are not alive. You require fresh flesh and life force which can only be obtained vide fresh corpses. Trust me, its much better than the alternative.\n\n4) So you see, we as undead are not supposed to be here. Hence, the government has dispatched certain…. Forces to make sure we are terminated upon notice. Here’s how to survive them.-\n\nA)If approached by a man in a hat, any hat, kill them immediately. They are part of the forces.\n\nB) Every fourth day, at precisely 2230 hours, there will be banging on your front door. This is a good sign. We have dispatched team members who help our fellow undead. If this banging does not occur it means your house is marked by the forces. \n\nc) If your house is marked, immediately burn it down. Leave no evidence of your existence. \n\nD) If the forces find you, congratulations! The government will be running experiments on you for longer than you’d like.\n\n5) As an undead, in order to keep yourself safe we suggest finding a deserted place for your lodgings with not to many people around, in case ‘that’ ever happens.\n\n6) As an undead you may be confused as to how exactly you function, but rest assured the only changes to your body are that you no longer need to sleep or eat. Everything else is the same.\n\n7) Now to tell you what ‘that’ is. Basically, if we undead are ever deprived of our meals for too long or feel that we are cornered beyond escape we enter a state of rage we cannot recover from. We lose all sense of reason and start murdering anyone around us. It’s not a good site.\n\n“Yo I need to use the bathroom, you done in there?” A voice interrupted my reading. There were still a few more rules but I’d have to read them later. May god help me.",

        "text": "Have you heard the phrase \"ghost in the machine\"? It refers to the belief that machines can sometimes take on a life of their own, as if possessed by some supernatural force. I never believed in such things until I purchased an antique computer at an estate sale. It was a vintage IBM PC from the 1980s, still in its original box and with all of its original components. But it didn't take long for me to realize there was something seriously wrong with it. \n\nEverything appeared to be fine at first. I set up the computer in my home office and started messing around with it. But then strange things began to happen. Even when I hadn't touched it, the computer would turn on by itself. The screen would flicker and glitch, displaying strange symbols and messages. The keyboard would type words on its own, as if it were controlled by something or someone. I tried to rationalize it, thinking that perhaps the hardware was simply old and flaky. But then things started to get worse. When I was alone in the room late at night, I could feel a cold presence behind me. I would turn around, but no one was there.\n\n I couldn't take it anymore one night. I sat down in front of the computer and typed \"Who are you?\" on the screen. To my horror, the keyboard started typing a response: \"I'm the one who arrived before you. I am the machine's ghost.\". The ghostly presence grew stronger and more malevolent. It would open and close programs, delete files, and send emails to people I'd never met. The whispering became more urgent and louder. It was as if the ghost was trying to tell me something important. Finally, after conducting some research, I discovered that the computer had belonged to a man who had died in a tragic accident......\n\nI was a wuss so I had destroyed the computer or so I thought\n\n3 MONTHS LATER\n\nI stumbled backwards in horror as I read the words on the screen. The same computer that I had thrown out was now sitting in front of me, somehow restored and functional again. I couldn't believe it. Was it really possible for the ghost to have found a way to come back to haunt me? I quickly left the store and went home, feeling sick to my stomach. I tried to convince myself that it was just a coincidence, that someone had found the broken computer and fixed it up. But deep down, I knew that something much darker was at work. \n\nThat night, as I lay in bed, I could hear the faint sound of typing coming from the other room. It was the same sound I had heard before, the sound of the ghostly presence inside the computer. I knew I couldn't ignore it any longer. I had to confront it, to find a way to banish it for good. I went back to the estate sale the next day, determined to find out how the computer had been restored. The owner of the store looked at me strangely when I asked about it, telling me that it had been donated by an anonymous person. But as I walked out of the store, I noticed a figure watching me from across the street. It was a man in a long coat, his face obscured by shadows. \n\nI could feel his eyes on me as I walked away, and I knew then that he was somehow connected to the ghost in the machine. That night, I performed another ritual to banish the ghost. I recited the incantations and burned sage, hoping that it would be enough to rid myself of the malevolent presence. But as I finished, I could hear the sound of laughter coming from the other room. It was the ghost, mocking me, taunting me. I knew then that I had to do something drastic. I took the computer and threw it into a nearby river, watching as it sank into the murky depths. I thought that was the end of it, that I had finally freed myself from the ghostly presence.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nThe next day, I received an email from an unknown sender. The subject line read \"I'm still here.\" Attached to the email was a photo of the computer, floating in the river. And then, I heard the sound of typing once again, coming from my own computer. The ghost had found a way to escape the machine, to haunt me wherever I went. And I knew then that I would never be free of it, that it would follow me until the end of my days.",

        "text": " I couldn't believe my luck when I won an OTK event to live with my favorite streamer, Asmongold. I was excited to spend a few weeks with him in his modest home in the suburbs of Austin, Texas. To give a little back story here: Asmon, as his fans affectionately called him, was one of the most popular streamers on Twitch, and I had been a dedicated viewer for years. All the way back to the days when he used to make solo guides for WoW.\n\nWhen I arrived at Asmon's house, he greeted me with a smile and showed me around the place. The living room was filled with gaming consoles, computers, and collectibles from his favorite games. His bedroom was a cluttered mess, with clothes, empty Wendy’s bags and soda cans strewn everywhere. But I didn't mind. I was just happy to be there, hanging out with my favorite streamer.\n\nThe first few days were uneventful. Asmon and I spent most of our time gaming and chatting about our favorite games and moments from his streams. He would stream for a few hours a day and I would hang out with him and engage in the react content when able, but I stayed out of it for the most part. But after the first couple of nights, I heard loud banging coming from the roof. I assumed it was just squirrels or birds, but every night it seemed like the noise continued to get louder and more persistent.\n\nThe next morning, or afternoon rather, when Asmon woke up I decided to see if he knew anything about the noises.  \n “Yo, Asmon,” I greeted him, “Have you been hearing those crazy noises at night too, or am I just going crazy?”\n\n“It’s those damn racoons again, man.” He threw his head back as he responded. “I’ve been meaning to call a pest guy and get them out here ‘cause I just don’t even wanna deal with anymore.”\n\n“Are you sure it’s racoons? It sounds like someone is using an excavator to scrape away the roof of the house.”  \n \n\n“Yeah, it’s racoons. They’re a little bigger in Texas,” He assured me. “Too bad I can’t just ban em.”\n\nWe both shared a laugh at that, which really helped lighten my mood. \n\nAs the days passed, the banging on the roof continued, growing louder and more persistent. It seemed to be coming from all around the house, and I couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of dread every time I heard it. I tried to ignore it, to focus on anything else, but the noise was there almost every night. A constant reminder that something was not right.\n\nA few days later, Asmon and I were sitting upstairs, playing WoW and trying to clear Ulduar again. Gus was in the middle of providing some top tier content for the stream as usual when the banging reached a fever pitch. It sounded like something was trying to break through the roof, clawing and scratching its way closer and closer to us. Suddenly, there was a loud crash as a group of massive beasts burst through the ceiling. They were giant raccoons, with horns sprouting from all over their bodies, their eyes sunken and black, their giant fangs bared in a menacing grin and claws the size of my fingers. I had never seen anything like it before - these were no ordinary animals. I leapt out of my seat, my heart pounding in my chest. Asmon did the same, yelling, \"What the hell?!\" as we both scrambled to get out of the way.\n\nWe ran as quickly as we could to the stairwell. I tripped and tumbled down the stairs, almost getting bit by one of those monstrosities. I scrambled back to my feet and continued the escape. The demon racoons were luckily slowed down by all of the clutter laying around, giving us enough time to run out of the house and into my car. \n\nI sped off and drove for about fifteen minutes before pulling over, finally getting a chance to process everything that had just happened. “What the hell, man!?” I asked frantically as I turned to Asmon, desperately hoping for some sort of explanation.\n\n“I told you, man. Look, the racoons are a real problem. I’d make you graph to show you how big the racoons are in Texas vs the rest of the w-“\n\n“The *SIZE* of the racoons isn’t the problem!” I cut him off. “Those… those… things came straight out of hell. Doesn’t the horns or giant claws strike you the least bit, I dunno, odd, terrifying, **SOMETHING**!?”\n\n“I dunno dude. Look, just calm down. We’ll stay here for the night and if they’re still there tomorrow, we’ll show them what going BD is all about.”\n\nI groaned. He wasn’t taking this seriously at all. I wanted to continue my protest. To grab him and shake some sense into him. But I was too confused what to even say to make sense of any of this. It took a little more convincing but I finally calmed down and at some point, must have fallen asleep because I woke up to the sun shining in my eyes. \n\nI nudged Asmon with my elbow, telling him to get up. We both got out to stretch and get ourselves ready for whatever we were going to return to. The drive back for me was nerve wracking. What if they were still there? Should we call the police? The fire department? Who even deals with stuff like this?\n\nOnce we got back to his house, we entered with caution. The front door was still wide open so we could see a decent bit of the house from the doorway. The place was in shambles. Those demonic rodents had chewed through walls, gathered garbage to make nests and just completely trashed the place. Even more so than it already was. But they seemed to be gone. At least for now.\n\n\"What are we going to do about these things?\" I asked Asmon, as we surveyed the damage to the house.\n\n\"We need to clean up this place,\" he said, his voice grim. \"These raccoons are attracted to all the trash. We'll have to get rid of it if we want to keep them away.\"\n\nWe worked tirelessly for days. We would clean up the house during the day, hauling away bags of trash and go sleep in my car at night, away from the house. It was hard work, but it felt good to be making progress. As we worked, Asmon kept spirits up mentioning how each bag of trash is just more experience gained and other quips to make the mountain of a task feel a bit more fun.\n\n\"You know, man,\" he said to me, wiping the sweat from his forehead. \"I never thought I would be doing this, but those raccoons won. After all these years, the house is finally getting cleaned up.\"\n\n\"You'll be alright,\" I reassured him. \"Better to have to clean than deal with those freakish monsters.\"\n\nWe were so close to clearing everything out. We had decided to just get it done and worked tirelessly into the night, barely stopping to eat or rest. The deed was finally done. The last bag of trash was thrown into the dumpster. We thought we had finally gotten rid of the raccoons for good. But we were wrong.\n\nThat same night, the raccoons returned, and they were angrier than ever. They had claimed the house as their own, and they were furious that we had tried to take it away from them. Asmon grabbed his Zweihänder, determined to protect his home and me at any cost.\n\n\"Stay back,\" he warned me, as he raised his sword. \"These things are lookin’ for a fight.\"\n\nThe battle was epic. Asmon swung his sword with all his might, but the raccoons kept coming. They screeched and clawed at us, their eyes blazing with hatred.\n\n\"Watch out!\" I shouted to him. “Two on your left!”\n\nOne of them lunged at Asmon, sinking its teeth into his arm and sending him crashing to the ground. I could hear his labored breathing as he struggled to fight off the beasts. I knew I had to do something, or he would be killed. So, I grabbed a nearby lamp and smashed it over the head of one of the raccoons, sending it sprawling to the ground.\n\nHe managed to get back on his feet, his face covered in sweat and drops of blood. \"We need to get out of here,\" he gasped. \"These things are too strong. We'll never be able to fight them off.\"\n\nTogether, we managed to make our way to the door, dodging the raccoons as they swarmed around us. We burst out into the night air, the cold wind whipping at our faces. Asmon's arm was bleeding badly, and I could see the fear start to set in as he looked back at the house.\n\n\"I don't know if we can go back there,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"Those things...they're not normal. They're something else.\"\n\nI nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. He was finally starting to realize the gravity of the situation but I couldn’t let all of our efforts go to waste. \"We need to figure out what to do,\" I said. \"We can't just leave them there.\"\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes filled with a mix of gratitude and fear. \"You're right,\" he said. \"We can't let those things win. We have to fight back.\"\n\nWe crept back up to the front door. I stopped and motioned for him to grab the door handle. I used my keys to pry the bolts of the door hinges up and we pulled the door off to use as a shield. We pushed back into the house just far enough to get back to the sword.\n\nAsmon claimed his blade once more and fought like a man possessed, his sword flashing through the air as he cut down the raccoons one by one. But there were so many of them, and they kept coming, their numbers seeming to multiply with every passing moment.\n\nAll I could hear was my heart pounding in my chest and the blood rushing past my ears as I braced the door as a shield for Asmon. The adrenaline surged through my veins with every swipe of their claws and gnashing of their teeth. We were both covered in blood, our clothes torn and ragged. One of the racoons came from the side and nearly bit my throat. I couldn’t help but freeze, fear finally sinking in. I dropped the door, or rather the small piece of it that was left. I curled up into the fetal position. This wasn’t a game. This was real life. How could this be happening? This was supposed to be the opportunity of a life time but this is a nightmare. Where do things like this even come from? \n\nI could feel my mind fracturing. None of this made sense. I didn’t want to be here anymore. My stomach rolled, my mind blanked and my body went limp.\n\nFinally, after what to me felt like hours, the last of the raccoons lay dead at Asmon’s feet. He limped over to and stabbed his sword into the carpet. \n\n“I got their asses.” He said to me between labored breaths.  \n\nI finally lifted my head up to look at him. He was badly injured, but alive.  We both were thanks to his bravery. We looked at each other and I could see the relief in his eyes.\n\n\"We did it,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"We beat them back.\"\n\nI nodded, too brain dead to speak. It was a hard-fought victory, but it had come at a heavy cost. His wounds were deep, and I knew that he needed medical attention as soon as possible. It took a few moments for me to compose myself but once I did, I got back to my feet.\n\n\"We need to get you to a hospital,\" I said. \"You're badly hurt.\"\n\nAsmon just smiled, his face pale and drawn. \"I'll be fine,\" he said. \"I'm a warrior, remember? I've been through worse than this.\"\n\nBut I knew that he was lying. His injuries were serious, and he needed help. We made our way to the car and I helped him as he stumbled along beside me. I could feel his weight on my shoulder, and I knew that if I let go, he would fall.\n\nAs I drove to the hospital, I couldn't help but think about all that had happened. The raccoons, the fighting, the injuries. It had been hell and I wasn't sure I would ever be able to mentally recover from it.\n\nBut despite all of that, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride even though my cowardice got the best of me. We had fought back against real monsters, against the things of nightmares. Against all odds we had won and it was all thanks the One True King himself. \n\nAs we pulled up to the hospital, I sped into the emergency lane by the E.R. I jumped out of car to help get him out and I could already hear hospital staff behind me coming to help.\n\n\"See,\" Asmon said. \"I told yall not just any mere mortal could live with me.\" He grinned with contentment and his eyes closed as he fell into unconsciousness. I knew that he was going to be okay, that he would pull through. But I also knew that I would never forget what had happened, and the lessons that I had learned about the true nature of the world we lived in.",

        "text": " \n\nI never really understood what drove my parents to move into some remote smalltown. No, it’s not even a town. To small. But also too big to be a village. Growing up I often wished we would have just stayed in Vienna, where my parents were born. They probably imagined some rural paradise when they decided to move to the countryside in Bavaria. What they got instead was an ugly house on a run down street next to an endless patch of grass and corn fields. \n\nIt is not a pretty place. And for us children it was also kind of boring. There was no park, or playground or anything. So instead we just met at the forest at the edge of town to hang out. It was not too far from any of us, so we could meet there regularly. At first it was just me, Michael and Florian but over the years a few other kids joined as well. \n\nThe forest was pretty big, so for us children there was always something to do. However there was one part that we avoided as much as possible.\n\nThere was an abandoned building deep in the woods. I am not sure how old it was. But definitely old. It was a big grey block with a few structures surrounding it. And the spookiest thing around. It was always locked and probably for the better. Now the building was not a secret. Everyone knew about it. There were claims that the place was haunted. Apparently one could hear screams from there at night. Some teenagers even claimed that they found blood next to the front door. And so we stayed far away.\n\nOne day our class made a trip to the city hall where I asked the Major Wagner about it. “Oh yeah, that’s an old warehouse.” He laughed. “Been abandoned since the 50s I believe.” He got a bit more serious and said, “Don’t go there kids. It’s a dangerous place full of old and rusty stuff.”\n\nThe Major then smiled and we moved on.\n\nI wish we had listened, but the older we got the more absurd we found our fears. It was an old ugly building. Not even ghosts would want to live there. \n\nThe beginning of Summer 2011. I was about twelve years old. My parents had just picked me up from school. I would not be going there for two months. However I did have plans for that day. Me and my friends wanted to camp in the forest. We planned to stay up all night but we brought sleeping bags and tents anyway. I was responsible for food. I brought candy, snacks and even some apple slices and grapes. In the late afternoon I made my way into the forest. Most of the other kids were already there. Florian was still missing, with him we would be six.\n\n“Max you are finally here!”, Sophie shouted from afar. She sat at a small table with Zoe. “What did you bring?”\n\nI opened my backpack and brought out the snacks. A few seconds later I was swarmed by everyone. “Hey thanks Max!”, Michael took a few chocolate bars for us and we sat down on a little rock. \n\n“So you think we will make it through the night.?”, I asked. “Yeah sure hope so! The one who falls asleep first gets thrown into the creek!”, he laughed. We made this rule a while ago. We wouldn’t actually have done that but it was a good motivator for staying awake. \n\nWe played a few games, ate way too much candy and argued over the music. \n\nAbout three hours later, we had turned of the radio and we were all sitting in Tobias’ tent deciding on what to do next. Zoe wanted to play Truth or Dare but I hated that game. With middle schoolers it always ends the same stupid ways.\n\nUnfortunately for me and soon everyone else I was outvoted. And so it began. As time went on we got bolder as we tried to outplay each other. You might have already guessed where this will eventually lead to. And yes at some point, it must have been nearly midnight, Michael dared Florian to go to the old building.\n\n“There is absolutely no way I’m doing that!”, Florian protested.\n\n“Oh come on. We will go with you. We just go up there and then leave.”, Micheal tried to be convincing. “Yeah, let’s go! Stop being a baby! It’s not like there is anything there anyway!”, Tobias, who had gotten bored of the game anyway, was excited.\n\n“I’m not so sure about this either. Let’s just stay here.” Zoe was unfortunately the only other reasonable kid there. And peer pressure won the night.\n\nThe building was not that far away. Maybe a kilometer. Still, walking through mostly dense forest isn’t all that easy. For a while we could follow the creek. Then we could go through relatively open patches of spruce trees. \n\nAfter that we had to climb up a hill. \n\nI was the first to reach the top. I looked directly at the building. Or at least into that direction. Still too many trees in the way. But I did see something. “Guys I think there are lights over there.”\n\n“Where?”,Florian sat down next to me,\n\n”Oh yeah. Maybe just the reflection of the moon.” We accepted this answer and moved on.\n\nThen we had to walk through a denser part of the forest. With many bushes and branches.\n\nAfter a while Tobias stopped moving. “Did anyone else hear that?”\n\nWe got quiet and listened. “What did you hear?”,Sophie whispered.\n\n“I think I heard someone shout.” Tobias answered.\n\n“Now you are just making up shit to scare us.”,Florian said while jumping over another branch.\n\n“I think he is the one getting scared.”, Micheal giggled.\n\n“I’m not!” Tobias walked past everyone heading further.\n\nBut as we got closer to the building the more we heard. There was something going on over there.\n\n“It’s late at night and it’s cold. We are imagining things. We should just go back and get some sleep.” Zoe said after we all agreed that we definitely heard someone this time. \n\nHowever I disagreed. “But we have already gotten this far so we might as well check out what’s going on. Probably just some other kids anyway.” \n\nSophie grinned and picked up a small rock. “Yeah let’s ambush them from behind.” \n\nWe had been walking for maybe 15 minutes when we reached the building. We climbed up the little hill where we saw it. I had never been this close.\n\nTo our shock we really did see lights through the old windows. And where there people inside?\n\n“What’s going on here?” Tobias asked. \n\n“No idea but I have the feeling I don’t want to know.”, Zoe said. I too, was slowly convinced that coming here was a bad idea.\n\nFor a while however we kept hidden in the bushes and watched. The windows were blurry and hard to see through. We could hear voices but not what they were saying.\n\nA bit further to the right was a little track in the grass with a truck on it. It looked somewhat like those the army uses.\n\n“What is the military doing here? Are those soldiers?”, Zoe asked while slowly standing up. \n\n“Get down!”, Michael yelled at her.\n\nA rusty metal door slowly opened and two men came out. They wore black clothes and had guns. \n\n“Guys I think we should go.”, Florian pleaded, “Please!”\n\n“Yeah I agree let’s get out of here!”\n\nAt this point we could all agree with that. Even Tobias.\n\nIn the meantime the two men began to talk. \n\n“At least this one didn’t scream so much.”\n\n“Yeah I think he was dead already at that point.”, the other laughed.\n\nThis brief yet terrifying conversation stopped us once again.\n\n“They are probably talking about something different.”, Michael said nervously.\n\n“I don’t care let’s go!”, Zoe shouted while nearly slipping. \n\n“Did you hear that?” one of the men said, “Hey, who is there, show yourself!” \n\nThe two began walking up the hill on the other side.\n\n“Run!”, Tobias whispered. And we ran into the trees.\n\nThe men reached the top of the hill. “Get out!”\n\nThen we heard a loud bang. Fortunately it was dark and they couldn’t see where we were. We ducked ourselves in a patch of grass behind a few trees. The men ran into our direction.\n\n“Did they just fucking shoot at us?”, Zoe asked while shivering in her entire body. “Pssht!”, Tobias put his hand in front of her mouth.\n\n“We have to get them, if they escape we are fucked!” The men came closer and closer.\n\n“At least we won’t have to wait for new bodies tomorrow.”\n\nFlorian began to cry quietly. “I wanna go home. I wanna go home.”\n\n“We will! Keep quiet.” Tobias ordered in a fake calmness.\n\nNow one of them came so close he would have seen us if he looked into our direction. \n\n“Now or never. Run.” Tobias said while jumping up and grabbing Florian and Sophie who in turn dragged me, Michael and Zoe along. \n\n“There they are!” \n\nAnother shot.\n\nWe just ran and ran without looking back. We ran straight through bushes and branches. \n\nThe men kept following us. However we did have the advantage that we knew this forest. After a while we couldn’t hear them anymore. We stopped running and sat down near a massive oak tree. Zoe nearly collapsed of exhaustion but Sophie caught her. “Hey stay awake! Stay awake!” “I am … awake!”\n\n“Ahm Max.” Michael pointed at my foot in shock. There was a massive gunshot wound behind my knee. Only then did I notice the immense pain.\n\n“Oh shit!” Tobias put his hand on the wound. “What do we do?”\n\n“I… I don’t know!”, Michael stuttered. \n\n“Take off your shirt.” Tobias told me. I gave it to him and he wrapped it around my leg. “That should hold for now, come on.”\n\nHe helped me up and we started walking. Our camp wasn’t far anymore.\n\nAfter a while I started freezing so Michael gave me his shirt. It didn’t help much however. Tears started to blur my eyes.\n\n“Come on Max. You can do this. We aren’t far anymore.” Tobias encouraging words did not help much. \n\nAfter a while we finally arrived at our camp. We could not be more relieved. But we were not alone there. \n\n“There you are I have been looking all over the place for you!” \n\nIt was Major Wagner. We were surprised but also glad. \n\n“What are you doing here?” Sophie asked.\n\n“Your parents called the police. They said they didn’t know where you were. Luckily I was nearby.” He then pointed us to get into his car.\n\n“Did you guys not tell your parents what we were doing today?”, Zoe asked as she went along.\n\n“No I did.”, I said.\n\n“Yeah me too. Who called you?” Florian asked the Major.\n\n“Doesn’t matter, get into the car.”, he shouted angrily.\n\n“Actually it does matter.”, Tobias responded.\n\n“We don’t have time for this! Get in the car!”\n\n“Who called you?” Tobias asked again.\n\n“Alright that’s it!” The major took out a small pistol and pointed it at us.\n\n“Is it ‘Bring your gun into the forest day’ or what?”, Sophie shouted.\n\n“Shut up and get in!”, the major yelled.\n\n\"Okay fine, chill. We are going.” Tobias held up his arms letting me go for the first time since we noticed I was shot. I nearly fell down as I had to jump on one leg.\n\nTobias went up to the major and stood there facing towards us. “Guys come on.”\n\nAs the others slowly followed Tobias stayed where he was. \n\n“Faster!”, the major yelled again. I wasn’t as fast as the others so I was a bit behind. \n\nBut as they reached the car, Tobias grabbed the majors arm and yelled, “Now!”\n\nMichael and Floran jumped on the major and Sophie ripped his gun out of his hands.\n\nThe major fell back and Sophie pointed the gun at him.\n\n“Max, quick!” Michael ran up to me to help me as the others got into the car.\n\n“Leave him!”, Tobias shouted at Sophie.\n\nWe all got into the car and Tobias started. The major was cursing outside.\n\n“Do you know how to drive?”, Zoe asked and Tobias shook his head.\n\nWe nearly ran over the major and I don’t think that was an accident. Then we drove of. We came to the main street an drove to Tobias home. Once there he told his parents everything and his parents called the police.\n\nWe never went back to the forest. Or our base. We didn’t even clean up. I mean I was in the hospital anyway. \n\nThe police never told us who shot at us or what was going on in that building. Instead they told us that we were not allowed to tell anyone what happened.\n\nThe building itself was demolished just a year after and the major hasn’t been seen ever since that night.\n\nEven now I wish I knew what was really going on, but we have given up hope at this point. Even after all these years I still have the urge to tell someone. Maybe this is the right place.",

        "text": "Dear Daisy, Im sorry for leaving you behind\n\nFive years ago I was in a really bad place. \nNo home. No friends, going through a breakup. Parents that hated me. I felt alone.\nSo I decided to kill myself \n\nAfters days of thinking and thinking I decided to go to a small forest on my area. I used to play there a lot when I was a kid. I evend gave my first kiss there. It was with thos girl, Miranda, who kissed me first and then started spreading the word at school that I liked girls. \n\n\nMaybe thay was the beggining of my loneliness.\nSo I went to this forest with a switchblade my ex had given to me and I planned to cut my wrists near the lake, where I had sex for the first time. It was Miranda again. Don't ask.\n\nIt was mid autumm. The leaves were orange and faing down. The sun was bright but not hot.\nIt was a really nice afternoon.\nI parked my car near the road, just next to the woods and I begin to walk, playing with the little knife with my hands. \n\n\nI would love to say that the moment I stepped on those woods I felt something off. That there was something wrong, anything. But truth is I was so caught up in my own feelings to notice anything.\nI didn't even realize I was being followed until a few hours later.\n\n\nIt was maybe 3:00 pm when I first heard her. Soft steps, shy steps. \nI let her follow me, I didn't really cared what happened to me. I was there to end my life after all, wans't I?\nSo I kept walking till she finally revealed to me.\nHer name was Daisy and she was a fragile looking girl with long brown hair, glasses and deep brown eyes. Nothing outstanding about her. She ways 20, maybe 21. Couldn't be older than that.\n\n\nShe was carryung a big sleeping bag and she told me she was lost and was following me to find the way back to the main road.\nI could instantly tell she was lying. She was scared. But more than that she was really sad. I knew she was there for the same reason than me. \nI let her follow me  but I tried to have some distance. \nShe didn't take the hint.\n\nDaisy liked to talk. And to talk a lot. In less than an hour I find out she lived with both her parents, that she had a cat named Dog (she found this really funny for a reason) and that she was an acuarious.\n\nI didn't tell her much about me besides my name.\nIt was getting late so we decide to camp. Daisy offered me to sleep with her and I acepted.\nA few minutes later after we fell asleep I  began to hear the noise.\nIt was like static. A horrible, irritaiting static.\nI woke up and I found Daisy crying. \n\nI didn't ask her what was going on. Instead I ask her if she wanted to acompany me to the lake the next day. She wiped her tears and said \"sure\". Then she smiled a gorgeous smile.\n\n\nThe next day we found a Man. He was sitting on the floor, his eyes closed and a smile on her face. We planned to avoid him, bit he opened his eyes before we could.\nHe looked at us and said \"Do you hear it? Such a beautiful voice\" \n\nI could tell by Daisy face that she was about to approach him to check if he was fine. I grab her by the wrist and just shook my head, saying no.\nWe continue our walk.\n\nAfter and hour I realized that something wasn't okay. At this point we should have aleready reached the lake. But we were still between the trees.\n\nDaisy was gettin worried and kept asking me where the lake was. I talked back to her, in not a so gently tone and I could se her body shaking and her eyes getting watery. I let out a sigh and apologize to her.\nThen we saw the Woman. And I swear she wasn't there a minute ago.\n\nOne moment there was only Daisy and me on the woods and the next there was a full ass woman sitting a few meters to us.\nShe smiled and said \"He has such a beautiful voice, doesn't he?\"\nI grabbed Daisy by the hand and we run the fuck away from there.\nAnd we ran. And ran. But there was no lake, nor main road. Just the same old dirty woods.\nI began to freak out at this point.\nSo did Daisy.\nWe cried our lungs out.\nThen it was night again.\n\nIm gonma spare some details; we were like this for seven days straight. No one ever came looking for us. The firts three nights we kept hearing the static. And by that third nigth I could swear that noice almost sounded like words. \n\nAnd the random people kept showing up. Always sitting on the floor. The first days they were smiling, repeating the \"such a beautiful voice\" crap. \n\nThen, the fourth day another man appeared from nowhere, but he was crying. And he said \"please close the door\" before dissapearing again.\n\nThat day we found three other persons two of them crying, one of them screaming. All of them saying stuff along the lines of \"close the door\" , \"we shouldn't have opened it\" and \"I can't stop hearing his voice, make him shut up\"\n\nThat night Daisy told me she told her parents she was gonna go camping. \nBut she was gonna kill herself I already knew that, but  I acted surprised.\nAnd I realized something, yeah, we were trapped in these woods, but we both came to kills ourselves anyway. So maybe that way we could escape.\n\nBut wathever reason we couldn't bring ourselves to do it. We decided to die on our terms. To find the lake.\nWe had nightmares. And in those nightmares we began to hear his voice. It was still the static, but it made sense. He was whispering horrible things to us. Letting us hear screams of the place where he came from. \n\nThe next day, the 5th day, the wasn't random people appearing out of nowhere. There were just their dead bodies. \nSome were intact except for their empty eye sockets and little bites ( and for the love of god, if theres one, I can't figure out what caused those bites. They looked like nothing I've seen before) in ther bodies. They were naked too.\nOther bodies were completly ripped apart though. Destroyed. Like if big claws had toyed with them. One of them, a kid, no older than 15, had no skin on him, except for the one on his face.\n\nDaisy cried and nearly kills herself right there. I should have let her do it. I shouldn't have stopped her.\nBut I did. The body was gone agaim in a glitch and I hold this fragile broken  girl on my arms. After she calm down she told me that her ex girlfriend died because of her. A car accident. \n\nShe felt guilty. The parents of the girl blamed her, and her own parents did their best to ignore her.\nI told her about my life too. \n\nWe sleep early that day and this time we dreamt about a big black nothing. Just and empty void, or at least it looked empty until you looked to close. We see his true form  but i dont remember it. I just rememeber waking up to Daisy hugging me tight.\nThe 6th day we found their home. Where this people used to lived. And we found out what happened. Kinda.\n\nThey brought this thing to our world, he killed them as fun. And now he was playin with us. Like a kid with ants. We also found that he couldn't stay here for too long. He had a day left, maybe two.\n\nWe continue to walk until we began seeing something different. A different path. New trees amd finally, the lake.\nWe hugged each other and she kissed me.\nI kissed her back.\n\nWere we still gonna kill ourselves? Were we gonns get out of there? Was i gonna take her out on a date? We would never know, because the moment we let hope slip through our hearts, the static began to ring again, and this time angrier and louder than ever. And it kept going all night.\n\nShe grabbed my hand and we cried. We run to the lake and try to scape the sound coverinh ourselves with water. It worked.\n\nIts time must have been running out.\nI looked at Daisy buy she was beyond sad. His voice had really messed her up. So she told me that we should go as planned, to kill ourselves as the voice told her there was nothing for her out there.\nI agree.\n\nWe came out of the water and got ready to face him and die on our terms, but something was different. The voice had told me things too. He show me visions of a better life. Off happiness. \n\n\nI realize now that he was lying. He just wanted me to let Daisy alone, so she would be all sad and in dispair for him.\nAnd I did just that. \n\n\nAs Diasy began cutting her wrist I got up and I ran. I stopped for a moment and for a second, just a second I saw her face. It was the look of pure loneliness.\nOf someone who has just felt love and hope , someone who was ready to die at peace but was treasoned in the last moment.\nI saw that look on her eyes just before she dissapeared in a glitch like the other.\n\n\nI runned and eventually found my car. \nIn the world outside the woods just a day had gone by.\n\nNo one came looking for me or asked where I was.\nBut everyone was worried about Daisy.\nDespite everything, her parents looked for her, her friends too.\n\nEventually they gave her for dead.\nI went to her house once. Acting like an old friend. I met her cat. He was cute.\n\nI was still alone. And with nightmares.\nAt first of being trapped in the forest again.\nThem about the god, and I have no doubts that this is what he is. A god.\n\nAnd I've been dreaming with her. Daisy in the void, her beautiful long hair floating in the emptiness. Her deep brown eyes being eaten away by some insects from another place.\n Her soul being tortured by an infant god who only wished pain and suffering.\nSo I'm coming back. Back to her, to go through my initial suicide plan. I know she's angry. The static tells me she's angry in my dreams.\nI deserve her hate.\nSo Im gonna take her place. Or try at least.\nIm gonna do the exact same rite those guys at thw wood did and I'm gonna talk to the god in the beyond. \nAnd she's gonna come back and realize she was worth it. That people missed her. Dog misses her. She's gonna read this and realize I'm really sorry for what happened.\nAnd I'm not gonna be alone anymore.\nI will have thousands of little creatures living in me.\nSo that't the end\nDear Daisy, if you're reading this, I'm sorry for leaving you behind.\n\n-Kat",

        "text": "My university was emptier than usual, at least were I was watching at. The faculty of my university is small and most of the time it is full all day, but the students took it almost a month ago. \n\nI was keeping watch, so that no one could break in and steal the library materials. I was alone in that place. The door was padlocked, and my partners were supposed to take care of the rest of the windows.\n\nI had arrived since 4:00 pm and it was getting dark. As I was next to one of the outdoor areas, I saw how the sun was fading. By the time it was seven, I was totally exhausted. At that moment, I heard a glass break. It seemed to be close, so I went to look, but there was nothing. Maybe it was the echo from somewhere else, but I couldn't get away from where I was.\n\nI take my phone to see if there was any message about that, but it doesn't have signal. Something strange considering that the entire faculty had internet.\n\nI checked a bit to see if I could connect to any networks, but it couldn't even identify any. After a few minutes, I gave up trying.\n\nSurely it was related to the sound before. Now I was with out signal and a bit nervous. A few minutes in silence made me feel like something wasn't right, but it wasn't until I heard footsteps that it left me confused.\n\nThe footsteps could be heard in the corridor next to me, they were heading for the stairs that were next to the library entrance. I waited for what I thought was any of my partners to ask them if they knew what had caused that noise, but no matter how close I heard it, couldn't see anyone. I got a little closer and could hear footsteps next to me, but there was nothing. And them began to climb the stairs. I couldn't see it but could hear each step that went up. That experience left me speechless, it was terrifying. I quickly returned to my place, but I kept thinking about it, I couldn't explain it to myself. When I calmed down, as much as possible, I decided to explore the college a bit to find help.\n\nOn the floor where I was, down to the bottom, it was completely empty. If I remembered correctly, there should be at least two other people in that hallway. The same thing happened upstairs. I searched room by room. There was no trace of a single soul. I was walking fast and scared.\n\nOn the third floor, I stopped short. As I climbed the stairs, murmurs and movements could be heard. Couldn't understand anything they were saying. When I reach the top, everything became overwhelmingly silent. I am not a believer in the ideas of energies, but in that situation, I felt a pressure in the air that did not allow me to breathe well. I hesitated, but decided to cross the hall. Frightened, I peeked into the nearest door. There was no one, but there was noise. Again a few steps sound.\n\nI checked door to door and once again, no one was there. Just empty rooms one after another, yet that was the most oppressive loneliness I had ever felt.\n\nI went down the stairs as fast as I could to the lowest floor. Once again there was something more calm, but I still felt observed by loneliness, I cpuldn't explain it better.\n\nI still had a place to investigate, but not only was it the one that made me feel most uncomfortable, but I already expected what I could find. I walked towards the theater area. I had only entered once, during the presentation of the facilities. It felt the same as how the third floor felt, even more intensely.\n\nThe first rooms was the same as the rest, empty. But I could hear something more than murmurs and footsteps. I was hearing conversations and words that I couldn't identify, it was just noise. A noise so clear that I could imagine the conversations. They came from a dark corridor, which, if I remembered correctly, led to a room similar to a theater. I didn't want to go in, I was terrified of finding anything again, so I just decided to run away.\n\nI took my things that I had left at my place and left through the main entrance. I forced the lock by hitting it. When I got out, I realized that I hadn't really looked out any windows before so as I would remember seeing that flat, pastel purple that seemed superimposed on the sky behind the buildings and trees.\n\nI checked my phone one more time, according to the clock, it was twelve at night. However, everything seemed illuminated, as if it were day but with a paler light.\n\nI was completely confused, nervous and terrified. The street was dressed in nothing, even more than the faculty.\n\nI ran to my flat, luckily it was close to my university. When I was there, I just lay down and fell asleep.\n\nThe next day the first thing I did was look out the window, the sky was normal again. At first I thought it was all a dream, but looking at the calendar it was already the next day. In college, my classmates asked me why I left without notice. Apparently someone had broken a window and left and they all thought it was me.\n\nBut that wa not all.\nThey also mentioned that last night some people felt that there was a mysterious specter playing.\n\nAfter a year, I try to understand what the hell happened?",

        "text": "  I used to love driving late at night. The almost completely empty roads, lit only by the white and yellow glow of the streetlights, along with the darkened houses and accompanying silence, only broken by the noise of my car’s engine and tires always used to fill me with a sort of serenity. It was a way to unwind and try and forget about the world as it was in the daytime, along with all the problems that came with the eternal rise of the sun. It was my own personal form of therapy and meditation, and it never failed to get me to sleep peacefully when I eventually returned home. Well, that’s how it used to be, anyways. Up until a few days ago.\n\nTo give you guys a little bit of context before I tell you what happened, I live in a moderately sized coastal town in the Pacific Northwest. I won’t say exactly where, as I don’t want anyone brave enough, or stupid enough for that matter, to try and replicate the exact conditions of my…experience, in hopes of testing it for themselves. I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I did that night. But, safe to say, while it is a rather beautiful place in terms of scenery, it’s also, in a way, rather forgotten about. Up until about the mid to late 80s, it was home to a bustling logging industry which, along with the local fishing port, was the town’s lifeblood since the beginning of the twentieth century, accounting for a large percentage of its resident’s income. But, when it was shut down in the early 90s due to arguments about some endangered species of owl that resided in the surrounding forests, the town just sort of dried up. It still attracts some tourists during the summertime, which supplants some of the lost income, but it never fully recovered from losing its biggest industry. It’s still more or less frozen in time as it was thirty some odd years ago.\n\nI was writing out my shopping list for the next day that night. It was the last day of the month, and because of an engrained routine from growing up with my mother, I always bought all the non food essentials I needed for the month on the first. That was when I remembered something which had slipped my mind, and slapped my forehead lightly. *You idiot, you forgot to gas up earlier!* I swore under my breath, then looked at the clock that hung over my kitchen sink. According to it, it was just past eleven, I think around eleven fifteen or eleven twenty. I bit my bottom lip and debated about what to do. I don’t like getting gas in the morning due to everyone all over town seeming to have the exact same idea at the same exact time, and packing into the station like they’re a tin of sardines. I knew that there was at least one gas station near my apartment which stayed open all night, which, for the moment, anyways, was still under $2.40 a gallon. “Ah, fuck it” I muttered to myself, pushing the pad of paper away and standing up from the table. I was feeling a bit restless, anyways; a late night drive, even for just a few minutes would help me relax. Pulling on my sneakers and jacket, I grabbed my car keys off their hook and stepped outside.\n\nThe late February air was colder that night than it had been all winter, and it stung my face as I walked down the stairs and crossed the parking lot to my car, noting with vague interest that there was no moon showing tonight, just the stars, and occasional brighter flicker of a satellite. Unlocking the door, I had to pull on the handle a couple times, as ice had formed and frozen it shut. Finally, it opened, and I slid behind the wheel, jamming the key into the ignition and starting the engine. After a few minutes of running the defroster, combined with having to get back out and use a scraper to rid the windshield of some rather persistent frost which refused to melt, I pulled out of the parking lot and onto the street. My neighborhood, like most of the rest of town, had mostly already gone to bed. I only saw a few yellow glows from people’s windows that indicated there were others burning the late night oil with me. After a few turns, I pulled into the bright lights of the gas station.\n\nRolling my window down, I pulled two twenties out of my pocket and turned the car off. We still have many full service stations in our area, meaning you’re not allowed to get out of your car and pump your own gas; you have to have the attendant fill it for you. He was talking to someone in a minivan, so I patiently waited for him to spot me. After a few seconds, he came over to me, shaking his head slightly. “Sorry, I can’t sell you gas right now, man” He gestured back towards the pump. “The computers are down for some reason, I’ve had to turn away everyone who’s pulled up for the last fifteen minutes” I felt my heart sink a little at his words. “Any idea when they’ll be back up?” I asked, hoping he’d give me a solid answer. But he simply shook his head again. “I honestly don’t know. It could be fifteen minutes, could be half an hour” He gave the pumps a look of disgust. “I knew connecting the pumps to computers would be a bad idea” he murmured. I grunted in reply, not really knowing how to respond to him. He looked down at me and shrugged, then slapped the roof of my car and began walking back to his booth in between the pumps. “Try coming back in about half an hour and seeing if we’re back online again” he called, stepping inside and sliding the door closed behind him.\n\n“Shit” I muttered to myself, rolling my window back up and turning the key until the glowing green lights of my car’s digital dash came on. According to the gas gauge, I had just about a quarter of a tank left. My car is a thirty year old Crown Vic, and if you don’t daily drive an older car, let me tell you something: a quarter of a tank really does not last in something that gets eleven to thirteen miles per gallon in town. I slapped the steering wheel and let out another “Shit”, trying to figure out my options. I could simply stay and wait to see if the computers fixed soon, but there was no guarantee of that, and after seeing how annoyed the attendant had been, I really didn’t want to become the new focus of his bad mood. *But what else can I possibly do?* This was the only gas station I had been to at night before, and I really didn’t know if any of the others in town were still open at this time. I glanced at the clock on my dashboard, which now read quarter to midnight. For a brief moment, I thought about simply heading back home and just accepting having to deal with the lines at the pump the next day. It would be a major irritation, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world. But then I shook my head. *I can at least check to see if any of the other stations are open and working before I give up,* I thought. Nodding in agreement with myself, I started the car and pulled out of the station. I wish to God I had just given up and not been so fucking persistent.\n\nI circled back around through my neighborhood until I drove across an intersection and onto a side road. The road ahead would wind through a few other neighborhoods and a brief, but thickly wooded area before emptying out into the other side of town, and it would save me a few minutes over taking the main road. I traveled down it, passing only a single house that had a light on inside. As I pulled up to a stop sign, I thought for a second that my windshield was beginning to fog up again. “Are you freakin’ kidding me?” I muttered, reaching over to flick on my defroster again when I stopped. I looked at my windshield and out of it for a minute, trying to comprehend what I was seeing. It took a few seconds, but then I realized what I was seeing.  *Crap. It’s ground fog. I got caught out in ground fog.* Now, if you’ve never dealt with ground fog, let me tell you that it’s more than a little jarring to drive through, not to mention dangerous. If you’ve seen movies where a ship gets caught up in a fog bank and can barely see what’s in front of them, take that, and then imagine trying to drive a car through it. You can easily lose track of the yellow median lines when it gets thick enough and accidentally drive off the road and wreck.\n\nI slowed down to about five miles an hour below the speed limit, but I kept going, still not wanting to admit defeat, even though I knew I was putting myself at risk. I’ve always had the misfortune of being hard headed and stubborn, and once again, it was keeping me from doing the smart move and turning around. I passed by through the second neighborhood, glancing out at the windshield at the houses and parked cars steadily becoming enshrouded in the thick white fog. For some reason, the view gave me a bit of an uneasy feeling. It was like looking at a version of something you recognize, but through the lens of a dream, making it feel unfamiliar at the same time. I shook my head to focus back on the road. *Don’t let your imagination run away with itself, bro. You need to keep your wits about you.* The second neighborhood fell away behind me, and I entered the section that was the most dangerous. This part had absolutely no streetlights, and I slowed ever further down, not wanting to accidentally hit a deer, or hell, a homeless person who might wander out onto the road. I fully admit, as I drove through this part, only passing by one or two houses and clenching the steering wheel as I stared out, able to actually see my headlight beams leading the way in front of me, my mind began to conjure up images from both my nightmares, and horror movies I’d watched. I imagined ghostly pirates from a John Carpenter film jumping out of the tree line to slash at my passing car, or some glowing eyed monster to leap from the trees. Basically, I succeeded in scaring the absolute shit out of myself. When I exited the darkness and drove back into the final neighborhood before heading down a hill to the other side of town, I let out a huge sigh of relief, deciding I would take the main road back, longer or not.\n\nAs I came to a stop at the intersection of the main road, I glanced left and right, and noticed something odd. As I said before, one reason I used to love driving late at night in my town was the almost completely empty streets. Emphasis on the word *almost*. Even at what my car’s dashboard clock now indicated as five past midnight, there would always be one or two cars driving on the main roads, from people working the late night or graveyard shifts on their way home or to work. Not to mention the cops that patrolled late at night. But now, as I looked around and strained my eyes to try and catch the glimpse of headlights or taillights through the fog, I saw nothing. Not a single trace of another human being. I shook my head and crossed the intersection onto another side street, shrugging, but inside, I began to feel that uneasy feeling which had come over me on the darkened road return. It wasn’t gnawing at me, almost shooed away by the streetlights passing overhead and momentarily illuminating the car’s interior the way a child’s imaginary monster might be frightened away by a night light, but it still lay just beneath my skin.\n\nI passed by the hulking shape of our town’s mall on my right, and then up to the curb beside to the Safeway next to it. From here, I could see the lit up gas station on the far end of its parking lot, which, for some reason, was surrounded by yellow tape. *Fuck, are you kidding me?* Apparently, it was closed for some sort of maintenance, which was exactly my luck. I glanced down at my car’s gas gauge, which now read just below a quarter of a tank, and rubbed my eyes. Sighing, I put the car back in drive and turned back onto the main road. There was one final place I wanted to check, a gas station two blocks up. “Please be open, please, for the love of all that is holy, be open” I quietly prayed, hoping my plea would be heard. However, as I crossed a bridge, I saw that it would not be answered. The darkened shape of it came rapidly up on me, then passed by and disappeared back into the ether that surrounded me just as quickly. “Damn it”, I muttered, slumping back into my seat as I stopped at another red light. I sighed and shrugged my shoulders in defeat. *Alright, I officially give up. This isn’t gonna happen tonight. Time to head back home*.\n\nI passed by the sign for the bowling alley, the building itself completely obscured by the white veil around it, and turned right at the next intersection, which led up the highest hill in town. As the car climbed, the uneasy feeling I had stayed with me. For the first time in a while, I disliked the silence. I wished that my car’s speakers hadn’t blown out a few months ago, as the radio would have been a welcome distraction from it. Cresting the hill, I navigated my way through another neighborhood until I came to another main road, this one which would lead me straight back to my side of town and home. I turned onto it, glad that I would be in my bed in a few minutes as I passed by a dark and empty park on my left. I’d deal with everything else tomorrow. As I drove down a hill, I finally spied another sign of life. Down a side street to my right, seen for just a split second, I saw the outline of a person standing on a sidewalk. It was too quick and too foggy to make out any details, but just knowing I wasn’t alone out here made me feel a little better, even if it was likely a homeless person wandering around. \n\nThat feeling lasted about another twenty seconds, until I reached the next intersection. I remember, I blinked a few times as if what I saw in front of me would disappear like a hallucination, and just up and said aloud, “What the actual fuck…?” with an absolute feeling of confusion coming over me. Every road in our town, even the main ones, have those stereotypical metal poles at the intersections with the green signs on top, telling you what streets you’re approaching in which direction. The ones I was looking at were not the ones that should have been there. Instead, they were the ones for an intersection I had gone through to get to the closed gas stations. I shook my head and glanced around, where I felt another pang of surprise rip through me. Instead of the AutoZone across the street, the Rite-Aid off to my left, and the Sandwich shop to my right, I saw the convenience store and houses that stood around the other intersection. Feeling confused as hell, I pulled into the empty parking lot of the store and put the car in park. I pulled my glasses off my face and rubbed my eyes, trying to make sense of what had just happened. *Am I really that tired?*, I thought to myself. *I’ve gotta be, and this fog is not helping*. I’d had moments before where I’d been so tired, I’d sort of drifted into autopilot mode and snapped back to find myself somewhere else, so I simply chocked it up to another of these moments. I slapped my cheeks lightly to try and perk myself up, then spoke aloud to try and focus. “Okay, time to get home on the double, man. This is dangerous now”\n\nI pulled back out of the parking lot, and drove towards the mall and the Safeway. A minute later, both passed by, the station still lit up and surrounded by the yellow tape. I turned right and drove down the road again, passing by the second closed gas station and the bowling alley. Following the path I’d sworn I’d done before, I turned up the hill, made my way through the neighborhood, and came out onto the main road. This time, I looked up at the street signs to make sure I was where I wanted to be. I saw with a sense of satisfaction that I was, indeed, on the right one. I turned onto the road and noted the park on my left, as well as the church looming out of the blanket of fog. As I drove down the hill, I glanced to my right again. The intersection whizzed by, but again, I saw the outline of a person standing a few blocks down the road in that split second. “Hmm”, I murmured aloud. *Maybe it’s not a homeless person after all. Maybe it’s someone up late going out for cigarette break.* The thought, again, made me feel somewhat better.\n\nAnd then it burst like a balloon pricked by a needle as I came to a stop. My eyes widened, and I felt my breath clench in my chest as I stared at the street sign. *It….it can’t be. It fucking can’t be.* But it was. It was the intersection. The. Same. Damn. Intersection. I sat there, my foot on the brake as I attempted to understand. I knew for a fact that I hadn’t drifted off this time, and I had kept careful watch of the streets I had taken. There was absolutely no freaking way I was back here; the two roads had no connecting links to each other. Hell, they, they were almost a mile apart. “This makes no fucking sense” I said as I leaned my forehead on my hand. I glanced down at my dash and saw that I’d lost a bar on the fuel gauge, spiking my stress further as I looked to the right to look at the distance to empty. It read, 20 miles. Swallowing hard, I let out my breath in a whoosh. “Okay, get a hold of yourself, you’re alright, keep a grip, don’t panic” I whispered to myself. I hoped that my own voice would provide me some comfort and stability, but it didn’t seem to help much. I looked around me and saw the same store and houses, then pulled away from the intersection. The mall and Safeway passed by again, but when I came to the intersection, I turned left instead of right. This road should lead me back to a main road which intersected with the one I’d twice attempted to get to. As I pulled onto the road, I pushed down on the accelerator just a little bit harder, almost as if to will myself straight to the end. The speedometer crept up to forty as a billboard for the local hardware store hanging over the street whipped overhead and disappeared behind me.\n\nI knew I shouldn’t be going so fast with such limited visibility, but as much as my brain was trying to rationalize what was happening, cold shivers were beginning to climb up my spine. And then they climaxed as the exact same sign came into view and went past. “Wha…” *There is no fucking way that just happened. There is only one of those signs in town, and there is no way that just fuc-* My thoughts came to a halt as I slammed on the brakes, the rear wheels locking up and sending the car into a slight skid. It came to a halt, and I felt like I was losing my grip on reality. I was back at the same intersection. I put both of my hands to my forehead, then slammed the steering wheel. “What the FUCK is going on?!”, I shouted, my voice slamming back into my ears in the enclosed space. I stopped and took a deep breath, then let it out. Shouting was not going to help my situation, no matter how fucked up it was. I thought for a second, then turned right and onto the street which I had driven down twice now. I had a plan concocting in my head, and I hoped to God it would work. I followed the same path that I had before, turning up the hill and back out onto the main road. As I did, I kept looking at the houses I passed, wishing silently that I would see one with its lights on. But they all remained dark. The streetlights no longer seemed as comforting as they once did. *They almost feel like beacons, alerting something to my presence.*\n\nI started as I turned onto the main road again. Where the hell had *that* thought come from? Pushing it away, I slowed as I passed by the park and church, until I came to the intersection I was looking for. A smile of relief crossed my face as I turned onto it and pulled to the curb. Putting the car in park, I stared down the street at exactly what I’d been hoping to see. The person I’d previously seen was still standing on the curb two or three blocks down was still standing there. *Thank you, God, for small favors.* I opened the door and stepped out of the car, stretching slightly from the slight cramp of sitting in it for so long. The second I did, I shivered at the chill that the fog brought with it, pulling the collar of my coat up to try and protect myself somewhat from it. I left the engine running and stepped forward, squinting my eyes to try and see the person more clearly. Whoever it was stood just beyond a street lamp at the head of a house’s walkway, draped in shadow. From this distance, I couldn’t tell which direction they were facing or make out any features. To see if they were looking my way, I raised my hand and gave a light wave. No response. *Must be looking the other way, then*, I thought. Glancing back at my car for a second, I began to walk forward, choosing the stay in the middle of the street where the street lights illuminated the most. As I came within a block of the person, I cleared my throat, hoping I wouldn’t have to raise my voice and accidentally wake anyone sleeping up. The person still didn’t respond.\n\n“Great”, I whispered under my breath, then bracing myself, I raised my voice slightly. “Uh, excuse me?” Silence. “Excuse me?” I said a little louder, “I need some help” Still nothing. I began to feel a little irritated, as I knew I was speaking loudly enough for them to hear me. I took a few steps forward. “Hey, buddy, I said I need a little help here” The figure stayed where it was, not giving any indication of acknowledgement. I gritted my teeth and stopped giving a damn about waking anyone up, feeling all the negative emotions from the night take over me as I began to stride forward. “Okay, look asshole, I’ve had one hell of a night, and I don’t know wha-“ The insult died in my throat, and my voice trailed off as I came to a sudden stop. The uneasy feeling I’d had before washed back over me, now accompanied by something else. Fear. A sense of fear so strong that it sent a colossal shiver up my spine, one that felt primal and instinctive. *Something’s not right*. I knew exactly what my thought had meant. No person, short of being completely deaf, should be this unresponsive to questions or insults. As my anger and irritation fell away, I realized every muscle in my body was tensed up. I also suddenly realized something else which made my fear rise slightly. In the silence, I should have been able to hear the person breathing, or shuffling around to stay warm. But there was nothing. Nothing but silence.\n\nI was suddenly overcome with a feeling like I should leave. Right the hell now. And that, whoever, or *whatever* that figure was, I didn’t want to see it. I slowly began to step backwards, trying not to make as little noise as I could. That’s when the figure moved. I froze as I heard a wet, sliding sound come from its direction. I couldn’t tell what it had come from, and I didn’t want to know. I was beginning to shake slightly, more from fear than the cold. And then it slowly began to turn. All reason left me, and I whirled around and began to dash back towards my car. I didn’t dare look behind me to see what was happening, all focus was on powering me to my escape. I reached for and snatched the handle, yanking the door open and jumping inside. Just as I began to slam it closed, I heard the sound which still wakes me up in the middle of the night, sheets stained with sweat. I heard the beginnings of a laugh, but not one which could have come from any human. This sound was at the same time dry as paper and wet as rain, croaking and filled with more malice and evil then I have ever heard in my life. And then my door was shut and I was fumbling for the gear shifter, yanking it down from park into reverse so hard I thought I would break it for a second. The tires screamed as I jammed my foot down onto the accelerator, and the car flew backwards into the empty intersection. \n\nI glanced up only for a split second as I put the car into drive to turn the wheel. And…God, do I wish I never had, because what I saw will haunt me until the day I die. The figure was still in shadow beyond the streetlight, but I knew that it was facing towards me now. Because I could see its eyes. It’s gold and red *glowing* eyes. I screamed. I screamed the loudest scream I ever have let out in my life as I slammed my foot onto the accelerator, the rear of the car breaking loose and sliding out behind me before the tires caught the pavement and shot me forward. The engine roared as I kept my foot hard down, no longer caring about hitting anything at all. All I knew was that I had to get away. The car left the road for a moment as it dropped down into a hill before slamming back to earth. Still I kept my foot to the floor. As I watched the speedometer rapidly climb towards sixty, I kept all my attention on the road in front of me to keep the car in a straight line. The lights whipped over my head, the wind whipping past the windows. And then I flew past the park again. “No…” I moaned out as the church flew past as well. I could see the intersection coming up again, but I didn’t dare look down the side street again. I just kept my foot to the floor as it whizzed by. The speedometer rose to eighty, and I spared a split second glance at the gas gauge. “Oh, God…..” was all that could wheeze out from between my lips. Somehow, in the span of time from my last turn around, so much gas had been used up, that there were only two bars left. The distance to empty read 10 Miles. \n\n“No, nonononono” I began bleating out like a mantra as the park again came into view. I refused to lift my foot, but this time, I shot a glance to the right as the intersection flew by. My fears were confirmed as with the split second glance I had showed that the thing was now closer to the main road than it had been before, all the streetlights on the road having gone out. The speedometer was now at ninety, and tears began to fall from my face as the park, church and side street kept flying by over and over again, disappearing and reappearing in the fog like a hellish vintage film background. Each time I flew by, it was closer and closer. When I passed by it again, it was standing at the very edge of the intersection, so close that I could hear it’s laughter filter through my closed windows and over the roar of my engine. As I looked down and saw the speedometer break a hundred miles an hour, I glanced up to see it standing in the middle of the intersection. The lights in it had gone out, and all I could still see was its glowing eyes. Screaming again, I jerked the wheel to the right, almost sending the car into a spin. The headlights for a moment illuminated the demonic visage hidden in the fog and darkness, and if they had stayed a microsecond longer, my mind would have broken. Even now, I can’t recall the exact details; it feels like my head will split in half if I try to. But the car barely missed it, and I heard the sound of its laughter change into a cry of rage, of indignation. I felt something strike the left rear of the car and I fumbled to keep it on the road. Glancing in the rear view mirror, I saw the gold and red eyes disappear into the fog, and I felt the tears flow freely from my eyes as I knew I couldn’t avoid it the next time. \n\nIn my head, I made the decision that if I saw everything pass by again, I would aim straight for the thing this time. If I was going out, I sure as hell was going to try and take it with me. I braced myself to see the park and church again. However, I was filled with shock when I saw the sign for the AutoZone light up the intersection in front of me. “Wha…” was all I could manage out as I flew through the intersection and past it. And the Rite Aid. And the sandwich shop. I glanced down at the dash and saw I was doing a hundred and ten as the Wal-Mart flew by on my left. *Was this a trick?* The answer came as I saw the lights of the gas station I had left flicker through the….*the lifting fog?* Yes, the ground fog was beginning to lift. I began to laugh, softly, still crying as I let my foot off the accelerator. My laughs sounded almost insane and I braked and pulled back into the gas station. I put the car in park and turned the engine off, my body shaking uncontrollably. I buried my face in my hands until a rap on the window caused me to shriek out and fumble for the keys. *It’s here, it was a trick! It…*it wasn’t. It was the attendant. He motioned for me to roll my window down, and I slowly did.\n\n“Hey, you got back here just in time; the computers are ba-“ He stopped as he caught sight of the state of me. “Hey, are you okay, buddy?” he asked gently, putting a hand on the door sill. What could I possibly say? If I told him the truth, as much as I wanted, he’d never believe me. Hell, *I* wouldn’t have believed me unless I’d just gone through what I had. I wiped my eyes with the sleeve of my jacket and pulled out the two twenties I had, trying to keep my voice from shaking. “Y-yeah”, I stammered a bit, “Just had a near miss on the road, scared the hell out of me”. I held out the money to him. “Can, I just get forty dollars of regular, please?” He took the money, still looking hard at me, then looked at the rear of my car. “Looks like you had more than just a near miss” he finally said. I stared at him in confusion, and he gestured for me to get out of the car and look. I stepped out on shaky legs, and thankfully had the door to grab onto as they almost gave out on me as I saw what he’d meant. \n\nDug into the left rear quarter panel of the car, just behind the gas cap, were three tears in the metal. They were deep and evenly spaced apart. *No, not tears* I realized as I stared at them. *Claw marks*. I kept staring at them as the attendant filled my car up, then snapped out of it as he handed my receipt, giving me a last hard look. As I turned to get back in the car, he called out one final thing. “Try not to drive in the fog again. I’ve seen too many people get taken by it!” I turned back to ask him what he meant, but he’d already shut the door to his booth.\n\nNow it’s a few days later. I know I’ll never understand what I stumbled upon, or what that *thing* was. And frankly, I don’t want to. I already deal with enough nightmares from the little I experienced. Nor do I know how I got away. When I see the ground fog roll in now, like I did last night, I close my blinds up tight and stay inside. And I will never drive late at night again. I won't tell you not to, but if you do, please, be careful. And whatever you do, don’t drive when the ground fog rolls in.",

        "text": "This is the story of the Slide Mountain Body Chutes.\n\nIn 2005 a group of hikers found a container on Slide Mountain Trail in Phoenecia, New York. According to an eyewitness (who will remain unnamed), it was a 12-inch-long pill-shaped capsule, heavy, and rusted shut. After some debate whether or not to open it, they decided to carry the container with them but wanted to wait to see what was inside until they had more decent tools, as a hatchet was deemed too “destructive”; though it looked modern and man-made they didn't want to risk destroying a park artifact. The eyewitness in question had no ties to the group other than having met them on the trail earlier that day and teaming up for some good company. (We think this may be why they didn't suffer the same injuries along with the rest but it is still unknown.)\n\nAt five o' clock PM that evening they set up camp below 3,500 feet on Slide Mountain. The eyewitness hadn't brought a sleeping bag or any bright clothing, so one of the main group had lent them an extra sleeping bag and a neon orange jacket, and they set up their ten-man tent before dark. There was talk to build a campfire but it was never done, since they had a portable propane grill. They ate beans and franks for dinner.\nThe eyewitness claims they retired to bed early, while the rest of the group chatted around the grill in the gathering dark. They then recalled a minor disturbance sometime in the night, but it sounded distant and having hiked all day they slept again easily.\nIn the morning the eyewitness awoke to find the tent empty except for the sleeping bags and clothing the others had worn, laid inside the bags. Thinking it was a prank, the eyewitness got dressed in the borrowed neon orange jacket and went outside to, again, find the camp empty. They waited until mid-morning before attempting to search for the party, though there were apparently no footprints leading away from the camp; not wanting to get lost (as they are self-reported to be an amateur hiker) they only traveled about 30 meters in each direction before panicking and continuing back down the trail the way they came the previous day. They returned hours later slightly battered and still wearing the neon orange coat, alerting the park officials that there is a lost camping group up the mountain before receiving assistance themselves. They did mention the odd rusty capsule, but nothing other than the tent and camping supplies were retrieved when the search and rescue party attempted to locate the others. It was labeled a tragic case of missing persons, and was assumed that all six of the other hikers had wandered off together and suffered the same fate, whether it was succumbing to the elements (it was mid-summer but the shed clothing was still worrisome) or falling down a ravine or cliff.\n\nIn 2011 the skeletal remains of six hikers were found by a routine park inspection, interestingly enough, on California's Slide Mountain Trail near Castiac. The remains were identified as the six missing hikers from New York. They had no traces of clothing on or nearby, and were laid lengthwise in twisted positions. A pill-shaped capsule was found in the center of the bones, though it was a stark contrast to the degradation of the bones, having seemingly been made of a dark shiny metal. No rust was on the container, despite being exposed to the elements. It was determined that the bones had not been disturbed since the time they were placed there, though the capsule was lying underneath them, and while the original eyewitness had mentioned a similar capsule it did not match the physical description entirely. It was labeled as a separate object of interest.\nOpening the capsule by hand proved impossible and it was taken to the Army Corps of Engineers in Porterville, CA, where they used an acetylene torch to split the casing. Inside were as follows: Six obsidian arrowheads; an unknown low-density substance that turned to powder at the touch, later determined to be plastic; several teeth; a solid ball combination of resin, ash, and broken beads; six polished electrum coins; and a brand-new neon orange jacket.\n\nThe teeth did not match any DNA in any current database, and did not yield any successful carbon dating range, though they appeared to be human. The resin ball was left untouched as it was assumed its inner contents would disintegrate if disturbed. The jacket exactly matched the clothing remaining from the 2005 New York hiking group. The eyewitness confirmed it belonged to the same individual that loaned them theirs.\n\nThe bodily remains were sent to an undisclosed professional who reported, appalled, that every single one of the hikers' remains had scratches lengthwise along the outside of the bones. Microscopic rocky debris was found lodged in the scratches. It was to be assumed, the report mentioned, that each of the bodies had been forced through a space too small for a human body to squeeze into; it went on to say that the bone trauma was caused perimortem, and though the remains were too old to accurately determine cause of death, it would also be assumed that prolonged forceful squeezing through some sort of small opening or tunnel was the reason for each and every one. The long twisted positions of the remains seemed to suggest this as well. However, there were no caves near the original camp, nor were there any where they were found, and having discovered everything they possibly could at the time the researchers put the case away mainly unsolved. How the bones got from one side of the country to the other remains a mystery to all. The surviving eyewitness had no other information to contribute and was subsequently left alone, thoroughly traumatized.\n\nThe rocky debris found in the bone scratches themselves was very similar in composition to that of the NWA 7034 meteorite found in the Sahara Desert that same year.",

        "text": "Before I begin, I want to say that English is not my first language, so please forgive any mistakes I make. I want today to tell the story of a woman named Valþrúður. I want to tell you of the mystery, the wonder, and ultimately the horror that she brought to my village. \n\nI live in a small town called Ísafjörður, in the Westfjords region of Iceland. Val's story begins in the winter of 1997, when I was only 5 years old myself. Before I really begin, I want to tell you about the security measures they use at the hospital nursery. Each baby is given an ID band on their wrist and ankle, that have matching barcodes; the mother is also given a wristband with a matching barcode to her baby. These bands are put on shortly after the baby is born and cleaned, and they are not removed until the baby goes home with the parents. Footprints are also taken. This is done to prevent parents from being sent home with the wrong baby. This is not a large concern here in Ísafjörður, though, because not many babies are born here; usually between 20 and 30 in a year, so mix-ups are unlikely. \n\nThe reason I’m telling you this is because on that night in 1997, there were two registered births at the hospital recently. Both of those babies were still there, and all the security measures had been followed properly. But that night, as one of the nurses was doing her regular checks, she saw that there was a third baby in the nursery. A girl. This baby had no ID bands, there was no name card on her cradle like the others, and there had been only two pregnant women treated there recently and neither of them had delivered twins. A review of the security footage was done; there was a camera focused on the outside of the nursery door, but no cameras in the room itself. After the videos were watched, there was never a sign of somebody taking a third baby into the room. By all the evidence, this girl had just appeared out of nowhere. \n\nThe police were informed, but they had no more insight than the security guard did. Eventually the decision was made that the child would be put up for adoption. The nurse who had first found her volunteered to take her, and this mystery baby became my little sister, Valþrúður. \n\nThe typical small town gossip began when the story became known. Most people had decided that the most likely answer was that Val was simply unwanted by her birth parents, and that they had sneaked her into the nursery somehow to be rid of her. My mother always said though that this had been considered and ruled out as an explanation. The intrigue faded over time, and Val was seen as just another child here. \n\nWhen she started school, that’s when the strange things really started happening. Some of her classmates proved themselves to be typical awful children, and they decided to make Val the main target of their harassment. Usually just childish things like calling her Enginnsdóttir, nobody’s daughter, instead of her real name because of the circumstances of her birth. None of their insults ever seemed to bother Val, and that only made them put more effort into their bullying. I don’t have the full details of what happened here, because Val would never say how she did it, but what I do know is that when she was 16, a plan was made by this boy Jón to lock her in a closet of the art room, downstairs in the basement of the high school and leave her trapped there for the weekend.  \n\nHis plan succeeded, for the first part anyway. One Friday, at the end of the school day he was able to get her in the closet and he secured the door shut. But as Jón would later find out, Val did not stay in there for the weekend. She reported what he had done to the teachers and showed them how the closet had been barricaded shut. He got in trouble, and the teachers were more concerned with what Jón had done to notice something at first. But later the fact was brought up that the closet was still barricaded shut, with a chair under the handle and a cord securing it further, but Val had gotten out anyway, and apparently she had done it without opening the door. \n\nThis incident seemed to frighten Val’s recurring bullies off and they left her alone after that, but rumors started being whispered again. Her escape, along with renewed interest in her mysterious appearance in the nursery led to talk that Val must be a changeling, a child of the Hidden People that they had decided to leave in the care of humans for some reason. According to the old stories, the Hidden People live in a world separate from ours; they can visit ours as they wish, they can only be seen if they want to be, and they have magic. \n\nThe rumors started to die away again, but Jón wouldn’t let them disappear completely, telling people that Val wasn’t human, and she couldn’t be trusted. People didn’t pay much mind to him, since she had always been polite and respectful; she worked at a bakery after school, and most of the townsfolk had met her; she certainly wasn’t the evil sorceress that Jón seemed to think she was.  \n\nVal moved away from Ísafjörður when she turned 18 to attend nursing school in Reykjavík. She was away for 4 years, and while she was gone Jón finally stopped his ranting about her. After she graduated, she came back here, and started working at the same hospital where this whole story started, and where Val’s story would end. On the morning of the 11th of January 2021, 24 years to the day since Val had appeared in the nursery, one of her coworkers arrived at the hospital for her shift and found Val’s body lying in the parking lot; blood staining the snow red around her, and a knife still lodged in her belly. \n\nNobody alive in Ísafjörður today had seen a murder committed here, and nobody knew how to process it; a young woman, barely starting her career only to have her life so violently and pointlessly stolen from her. Pretty much everyone suspected Jón right away; at times his talk about Val was bordering on obsession, and he confessed in short order once the police questioned him. And this is also where Jón’s story ends. Here in Ísafjörður there isn’t really a jail, just a drunk tank downstairs in the police building; it has always been a peaceful town, and there was never a need for a jail. After Jón confessed, he was locked in the drunk tank while preparations were made for him to be sent to Reykjavík so he could be formally charged with Val’s murder. \n\nJón was obsessive about this at times, telling people that Val really was one of the Hidden People. But what he never thought to consider was the fact that she had been left in the hospital nursery; whoever put her there obviously wanted her to be taken care of, and they would be very angry about what was done to her. He learned of their anger in the worst of ways. The night before he was scheduled to be sent to Reykjavík, he had asked the guard for a bottle of water. In the few short moments it took the guard to walk up the stairs, get the water and come back, every bone in Jón’s body had been broken, some so forcefully that they broke the skin and spattered blood around the cell. Just like how it had been when Val appeared in the nursery, the camera never showed anyone else going down there. \n\nValþrúður Lokadóttir was laid to rest here in Ísafjörður; it’s what she would have wanted. The whole town had come out to say their goodbyes, and I like to think that Val’s birth parents were there too, unseen but seeing that we had cared for her. I think that I’m right about that, that they’ve seen we’re not all like Jón. Because two days ago, a baby was found in the nursery at the hospital; a baby who had no ID bands",

        "text": "  \n\nI used to love driving late at night. The almost completely empty roads, lit only by the white and yellow glow of the streetlights, along with the darkened houses and accompanying silence, only broken by the noise of my car’s engine and tires always used to fill me with a sort of serenity. It was a way to unwind and try and forget about the world as it was in the daytime, along with all the problems that came with the eternal rise of the sun. It was my own personal form of therapy and meditation, and it never failed to get me to sleep peacefully when I eventually returned home. Well, that’s how it used to be, anyways. Up until a few days ago.\n\nTo give you guys a little bit of context before I tell you what happened, I live in a moderately sized coastal town in the Pacific Northwest. I won’t say exactly where, as I don’t want anyone brave enough, or stupid enough for that matter, to try and replicate the exact conditions of my…experience, in hopes of testing it for themselves. I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I did that night. But, safe to say, while it is a rather beautiful place in terms of scenery, it’s also, in a way, rather forgotten about. Up until about the mid to late 80s, it was home to a bustling logging industry, which along with the local fishing port, was the town’s lifeblood since the beginning of the twentieth century, accounting for a large percentage of its resident’s income. But, when it was shut down in the early 90s due to arguments about some endangered species of owl that resided in the surrounding forests, the town just sort of dried up. It still attracts some tourists during the summertime, which supplants some of the lost income, but it never fully recovered from losing its biggest industry. It’s still more or less frozen in time as it was thirty some odd years ago.\n\nI was writing out my shopping list for the next day that night. It was the last day of the month, and because of an engrained routine from growing up with my mother, I always bought all the non food essentials I needed for the month on the first. That was when I remembered something which had slipped my mind, and slapped my forehead lightly. *You idiot, you forgot to gas up earlier!* I swore under my breath, then looked at the clock that hung over my kitchen sink. According to it, it was just past eleven, I think around eleven fifteen or eleven twenty. I bit my bottom lip and debated about what to do. I don’t like getting gas in the morning due to everyone all over town seeming to have the exact same idea at the same exact time, and packing into the station like they’re a tin of sardines. I knew that there was at least one gas station near my apartment which stayed open all night, which, for the moment, anyways, was still under $2.40 a gallon. “Ah, fuck it” I muttered to myself, pushing the pad of paper away and standing up from the table. I was feeling a bit restless, anyways; a late night drive, even for just a few minutes would help me relax. Pulling on my sneakers and jacket, I grabbed my car keys off their hook and stepped outside.\n\nThe late February air was colder that night than it had been all winter, and it stung my face as I walked down the stairs and crossed the parking lot to my car, noting with vague interest that there was no moon showing tonight, just the stars, and occasional brighter flicker of a satellite. Unlocking the door, I had to pull on the handle a couple times, as ice had formed and frozen it shut. Finally, it opened, and I slid behind the wheel, jamming the key into the ignition and starting the engine. After a few minutes of running the defroster, combined with having to get back out and use a scraper to rid the windshield of some rather persistent frost which refused to melt, I pulled out of the parking lot and onto the street. My neighborhood, like most of the rest of town, had mostly already gone to bed. I only saw a few yellow glows from people’s windows that indicated there were others burning the late night oil with me. After a few turns, I pulled into the bright lights of the gas station.\n\nRolling my window down, I pulled two twenties out of my pocket and turned the car off. We still have many full service stations in our area, meaning you’re not allowed to get out of your car and pump your own gas; you have to have the attendant fill it for you. He was talking to someone in a minivan, so I patiently waited for him to spot me. After a few seconds, he came over to me, shaking his head slightly. “Sorry, I can’t sell you gas right now, man” He gestured back towards the pump. “The computers are down for some reason, I’ve had to turn away everyone who’s pulled up for the last fifteen minutes” I felt my heart sink a little at his words. “Any idea when they’ll be back up?” I asked, hoping he’d give me a solid answer. But he simply shook his head again. “I honestly don’t know. It could be fifteen minutes, could be half an hour” He gave the pumps a look of disgust. “I knew connecting the pumps to computers would be a bad idea” he murmured. I grunted in reply, not really knowing how to respond to him. He looked down at me and shrugged, then slapped the roof of my car and began walking back to his booth in between the pumps. “Try coming back in about half an hour and seeing if we’re back online again” he called, stepping inside and sliding the door closed behind him.\n\n“Shit” I muttered to myself, rolling my window back up and turning the key until the glowing green lights of my car’s digital dash came on. According to the gas gauge, I had just about a quarter of a tank left. My car is a thirty year old Crown Vic, and if you don’t daily drive an older car, let me tell you something: a quarter of a tank really does not last in something that gets eleven to thirteen miles per gallon in town. I slapped the steering wheel and let out another “Shit”, trying to figure out my options. I could simply stay and wait to see if the computers fixed soon, but there was no guarantee of that, and after seeing how annoyed the attendant had been, I really didn’t want to become the new focus of his bad mood. *But what else can I possibly do?* This was the only gas station I had been to at night before, and I really didn’t know if any of the others in town were still open at this time. I glanced at the clock on my dashboard, which now read quarter to midnight. For a brief moment, I thought about simply heading back home and just accepting having to deal with the lines at the pump the next day. It would be a major irritation, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world. But then I shook my head. *I can at least check to see if any of the other stations are open and working before I give up,* I thought. Nodding in agreement with myself, I started the car and pulled out of the station. I wish to God I had just given up and not been so fucking persistent.\n\nI circled back around through my neighborhood until I drove across an intersection and onto a side road. The road ahead would wind through a few other neighborhoods and a brief, but thickly wooded area before emptying out into the other side of town, and it would save me a few minutes over taking the main road. I traveled down it, passing only a single house that had a light on inside. As I pulled up to a stop sign, I thought for a second that my windshield was beginning to fog up again. “Are you freakin’ kidding me?” I muttered, reaching over to flick on my defroster again when I stopped. I looked at my windshield and out of it for a minute, trying to comprehend what I was seeing. It took a few seconds, but then I realized what I was seeing.  *Crap. It’s ground fog. I got caught out in ground fog.* Now, if you’ve never dealt with ground fog, let me tell you that it’s more than a little jarring to drive through, not to mention dangerous. If you’ve seen movies where a ship gets caught up in a fog bank and can barely see what’s in front of them, take that, and then imagine trying to drive a car through it. You can easily lose track of the yellow median lines when it gets thick enough and accidentally drive off the road and wreck.\n\nI slowed down to about five miles an hour below the speed limit, but I kept going, still not wanting to admit defeat, even though I knew I was putting myself at risk. I’ve always had the misfortune of being hard headed and stubborn, and once again, it was keeping me from doing the smart move and turning around. I passed by through the second neighborhood, glancing out at the windshield at the houses and parked cars steadily becoming enshrouded in the thick white fog. For some reason, the view gave me a bit of an uneasy feeling. It was like looking at a version of something you recognize, but through the lens of a dream, making it feel unfamiliar at the same time. I shook my head to focus back on the road. *Don’t let your imagination run away with itself, bro. You need to keep your wits about you.* The second neighborhood fell away behind me, and I entered the section that was the most dangerous. This part had absolutely no streetlights, and I slowed ever further down, not wanting to accidentally hit a deer, or hell, a homeless person who might wander out onto the road. I fully admit, as I drove through this part, only passing by one or two houses and clenching the steering wheel as I stared out, able to actually see my headlight beams leading the way in front of me, my mind began to conjure up images from both my nightmares, and horror movies I’d watched. I imagined ghostly pirates from a John Carpenter film jumping out of the tree line to slash at my passing car, or some glowing eyed monster to leap from the trees. Basically, I succeeded in scaring the absolute shit out of myself. When I exited the darkness and drove back into the final neighborhood before heading down a hill to the other side of town, I let out a huge sigh of relief, deciding I would take the main road back, longer or not.\n\nAs I came to a stop at the intersection of the main road, I glanced left and right, and noticed something odd. As I said before, one reason I used to love driving late at night in my town was the almost completely empty streets. Emphasis on the word *almost*. Even at what my car’s dashboard clock now indicated as five past midnight, there would always be one or two cars driving on the main roads, from people working the late night or graveyard shifts on their way home or to work. Not to mention the cops that patrolled late at night. But now, as I looked around and strained my eyes to try and catch the glimpse of headlights or taillights through the fog, I saw nothing. Not a single trace of another human being. I shook my head and crossed the intersection onto another side street, shrugging, but inside, I began to feel that uneasy feeling which had come over me on the darkened road return. It wasn’t gnawing at me, almost shooed away by the streetlights passing overhead and momentarily illuminating the car’s interior the way a child’s imaginary monster might be frightened away by a night light, but it still lay just beneath my skin.\n\nI passed by the hulking shape of our town’s mall on my right, and then up to the curb beside to the Safeway next to it. From here, I could see the lit up gas station on the far end of its parking lot, which, for some reason, was surrounded by yellow tape. *Fuck, are you kidding me?* Apparently, it was closed for some sort of maintenance, which was exactly my luck. I glanced down at my car’s gas gauge, which now read just below a quarter of a tank, and rubbed my eyes. Sighing, I put the car back in drive and turned back onto the main road. There was one final place I wanted to check, a gas station two blocks up. “Please be open, please, for the love of all that is holy, be open” I quietly prayed, hoping my plea would be heard. However, as I crossed a bridge, I saw that it would not be answered. The darkened shape of it came rapidly up on me, then passed by and disappeared back into the ether that surrounded me just as quickly. “Damn it”, I muttered, slumping back into my seat as I stopped at another red light. I sighed and shrugged my shoulders in defeat. *Alright, I officially give up. This isn’t gonna happen tonight. Time to head back home*.\n\nI passed by the sign for the bowling alley, the building itself completely obscured by the white veil around it, and turned right at the next intersection, which led up the highest hill in town. As the car climbed, the uneasy feeling I had stayed with me. For the first time in a while, I disliked the silence. I wished that my car’s speakers hadn’t blown out a few months ago, as the radio would have been a welcome distraction from it. Cresting the hill, I navigated my way through another neighborhood until I came to another main road, this one which would lead me straight back to my side of town and home. I turned onto it, glad that I would be in my bed in a few minutes as I passed by a dark and empty park on my left. I’d deal with everything else tomorrow. As I drove down a hill, I finally spied another sign of life. Down a side street to my right, seen for just a split second, I saw the outline of a person standing on a sidewalk. It was too quick and too foggy to make out any details, but just knowing I wasn’t alone out here made me feel a little better, even if it was likely a homeless person wandering around. \n\nThat feeling lasted about another twenty seconds, until I reached the next intersection. I remember, I blinked a few times as if what I saw in front of me would disappear like a hallucination, and just up and said aloud, “What the actual fuck…?” with an absolute feeling of confusion coming over me. Every road in our town, even the main ones, have those stereotypical metal poles at the intersections with the green signs on top, telling you what streets you’re approaching in which direction. The ones I was looking at were not the ones that should have been there. Instead, they were the ones for an intersection I had gone through to get to the closed gas stations. I shook my head and glanced around, where I felt another pang of surprise rip through me. Instead of the AutoZone across the street, the Rite-Aid off to my left, and the Sandwich shop to my right, I saw the convenience store and houses that stood around the other intersection. Feeling confused as hell, I pulled into the empty parking lot of the store and put the car in park. I pulled my glasses off my face and rubbed my eyes, trying to make sense of what had just happened. *Am I really that tired?*, I thought to myself. *I’ve gotta be, and this fog is not helping*. I’d had moments before where I’d been so tired, I’d sort of drifted into autopilot mode and snapped back to find myself somewhere else, so I simply chocked it up to another of these moments. I slapped my cheeks lightly to try and perk myself up, then spoke aloud to try and focus. “Okay, time to get home on the double, man. This is dangerous now”\n\nI pulled back out of the parking lot, and drove towards the mall and the Safeway. A minute later, both passed by, the station still lit up and surrounded by the yellow tape. I turned right and drove down the road again, passing by the second closed gas station and the bowling alley. Following the path I’d sworn I’d done before, I turned up the hill, made my way through the neighborhood, and came out onto the main road. This time, I looked up at the street signs to make sure I was where I wanted to be. I saw with a sense of satisfaction that I was, indeed, on the right one. I turned onto the road and noted the park on my left, as well as the church looming out of the blanket of fog. As I drove down the hill, I glanced to my right again. The intersection whizzed by, but again, I saw the outline of a person standing a few blocks down the road in that split second. “Hmm”, I murmured aloud. *Maybe it’s not a homeless person after all. Maybe it’s someone up late going out for cigarette break.* The thought, again, made me feel somewhat better.\n\nAnd then it burst like a balloon pricked by a needle as I came to a stop. My eyes widened, and I felt my breath clench in my chest as I stared at the street sign. *It….it can’t be. It fucking can’t be.* But it was. It was the intersection. The. Same. Damn. Intersection. I sat there, my foot on the brake as I attempted to understand. I knew for a fact that I hadn’t drifted off this time, and I had kept careful watch of the streets I had taken. There was absolutely no freaking way I was back here; the two roads had no connecting links to each other. Hell, they, they were almost a mile apart. “This makes no fucking sense” I said as I leaned my forehead on my hand. I glanced down at my dash and saw that I’d lost a bar on the fuel gauge, spiking my stress further as I looked to the right to look at the distance to empty. It read, 20 miles. Swallowing hard, I let out my breath in a whoosh. “Okay, get a hold of yourself, you’re alright, keep a grip, don’t panic” I whispered to myself. I hoped that my own voice would provide me some comfort and stability, but it didn’t seem to help much. I looked around me and saw the same store and houses, then pulled away from the intersection. The mall and Safeway passed by again, but when I came to the intersection, I turned left instead of right. This road should lead me back to a main road which intersected with the one I’d twice attempted to get to. As I pulled onto the road, I pushed down on the accelerator just a little bit harder, almost as if to will myself straight to the end. The speedometer crept up to forty as a billboard for the local hardware store hanging over the street whipped overhead and disappeared behind me. I knew I shouldn’t be going so fast with such limited visibility, but as much as my brain was trying to rationalize what was happening, cold shivers were beginning to climb up my spine.\n\nAnd then they climaxed as the exact same sign came into view and went past. “Wha…” *There is no fucking way that just happened. There is only one of those signs in town, and there is no way that just fuc-* My thoughts came to a halt as I slammed on the brakes, the rear wheels locking up and sending the car into a slight skid. It came to a halt, and I felt like I was losing my grip on reality. I was back at the same intersection. I put both of my hands to my forehead, then slammed the steering wheel. “What the FUCK is going on?!”, I shouted, my voice slamming back into my ears in the enclosed space. I stopped and took a deep breath, then let it out. Shouting was not going to help my situation, no matter how fucked up it was. I thought for a second, then turned right and onto the street which I had driven down twice now. I had a plan concocting in my head, and I hoped to God it would work. I followed the same path that I had before, turning up the hill and back out onto the main road. As I did, I kept looking at the houses I passed, wishing silently that I would see one with its lights on. But they all remained dark. The streetlights no longer seemed as comforting as they once did. *They almost feel like beacons, alerting something to my presence.*\n\nI started as I turned onto the main road again. Where the hell had *that* thought come from? Pushing it away, I slowed as I passed by the park and church, until I came to the intersection I was looking for. A smile of relief crossed my face as I turned onto it and pulled to the curb. Putting the car in park, I stared down the street at exactly what I’d been hoping to see. The person I’d previously seen was still standing on the curb two or three blocks down was still standing there. *Thank you, God, for small favors.* I opened the door and stepped out of the car, stretching slightly from the slight cramp of sitting in it for so long. The second I did, I shivered at the chill that the fog brought with it, pulling the collar of my coat up to try and protect myself somewhat from it. I left the engine running and stepped forward, squinting my eyes to try and see the person more clearly. Whoever it was stood just beyond a street lamp at the head of a house’s walkway, draped in shadow. From this distance, I couldn’t tell which direction they were facing or make out any features. To see if they were looking my way, I raised my hand and gave a light wave. No response. *Must be looking the other way, then*, I thought. Glancing back at my car for a second, I began to walk forward, choosing the stay in the middle of the street where the street lights illuminated the most. As I came within a block of the person, I cleared my throat, hoping I wouldn’t have to raise my voice and accidentally wake anyone sleeping up. The person still didn’t respond.\n\n“Great”, I whispered under my breath, then bracing myself, I raised my voice slightly. “Uh, excuse me?” Silence. “Excuse me?” I said a little louder, “I need some help” Still nothing. I began to feel a little irritated, as I knew I was speaking loudly enough for them to hear me. I took a few steps forward. “Hey, buddy, I said I need a little help here” The figure stayed where it was, not giving any indication of acknowledgement. I gritted my teeth and stopped giving a damn about waking anyone up, feeling all the negative emotions from the night take over me as I began to stride forward. “Okay, look asshole, I’ve had one hell of a night, and I don’t know wha-“ The insult died in my throat, and my voice trailed off as I came to a sudden stop. The uneasy feeling I’d had before washed back over me, now accompanied by something else. Fear. A sense of fear so strong that it sent a colossal shiver up my spine, one that felt primal and instinctive. *Something’s not right*. I knew exactly what my thought had meant. No person, short of being completely deaf, should be this unresponsive to questions or insults. As my anger and irritation fell away, I realized every muscle in my body was tensed up. I also suddenly realized something else which made my fear rise slightly. In the silence, I should have been able to hear the person breathing, or shuffling around to stay warm. But there was nothing. Nothing but silence.\n\nI was suddenly overcome with a feeling like I should leave. Right the hell now. And that, whoever, or *whatever* that figure was, I didn’t want to see it. I slowly began to step backwards, trying not to make as little noise as I could. That’s when the figure moved. I froze as I heard a wet, sliding sound come from its direction. I couldn’t tell what it had come from, and I didn’t want to know. I was beginning to shake slightly, more from fear than the cold. And then it slowly began to turn. All reason left me, and I whirled around and began to dash back towards my car. I didn’t dare look behind me to see what was happening, all focus was on powering me to my escape. I reached for and snatched the handle, yanking the door open and jumping inside. Just as I began to slam it closed, I heard the sound which still wakes me up in the middle of the night, sheets stained with sweat. I heard the beginnings of a laugh, but not one which could have come from any human. This sound was at the same time dry as paper and wet as rain, croaking and filled with more malice and evil then I have ever heard in my life. And then my door was shut and I was fumbling for the gear shifter, yanking it down from park into reverse so hard I thought I would break it for a second. The tires screamed as I jammed my foot down onto the accelerator, and the car flew backwards into the empty intersection. \n\nI glanced up only for a split second as I put the car into drive to turn the wheel. And…God, do I wish I never had, because what I saw will haunt me until the day I die. The figure was still in shadow beyond the streetlight, but I knew that it was facing towards me now. Because I could see its eyes. It’s gold and red *glowing* eyes. I screamed. I screamed the loudest scream I ever have let out in my life as I slammed my foot onto the accelerator, the rear of the car breaking loose and sliding out behind me before the tires caught the pavement and shot me forward. The engine roared as I kept my foot hard down, no longer caring about hitting anything at all. All I knew was that I had to get away. The car left the road for a moment as it dropped down into a hill before slamming back to earth. Still I kept my foot to the floor. As I watched the speedometer rapidly climb towards sixty, I kept all my attention on the road in front of me to keep the car in a straight line. The lights whipped over my head, the wind whipping past the windows. And then I flew past the park again. “No…” I moaned out as the church flew past as well. I could see the intersection coming up again, but I didn’t dare look down the side street again. I just kept my foot to the floor as it whizzed by. The speedometer rose to eighty, and I spared a split second glance at the gas gauge. “Oh, God…..” was all that could wheeze out from between my lips. Somehow, in the span of time from my last turn around, so much gas had been used up, that there were only two bars left. The distance to empty read 10 Miles. \n\n“No, nonononono” I began bleating out like a mantra as the park again came into view. I refused to lift my foot, but this time, I shot a glance to the right as the intersection flew by. My fears were confirmed as with the split second glance I had showed that the thing was now closer to the main road than it had been before, all the streetlights on the road having gone out. The speedometer was now at ninety, and tears began to fall from my face as the park, church and side street kept flying by over and over again, disappearing and reappearing in the fog like a hellish vintage film background. Each time I flew by, it was closer and closer. When I passed by it again, it was standing at the very edge of the intersection, so close that I could hear it’s laughter filter through my closed windows and over the roar of my engine. As I looked down and saw the speedometer break a hundred miles an hour, I glanced up to see it standing in the middle of the intersection. The lights in it had gone out, and all I could still see was its glowing eyes. Screaming again, I jerked the wheel to the right, almost sending the car into a spin. The headlights for a moment illuminated the demonic visage hidden in the fog and darkness, and if they had stayed a microsecond longer, my mind would have broken. Even now, I can’t recall the exact details; it feels like my head will split in half if I try to. But the car barely missed it, and I heard the sound of its laughter change into a cry of rage, of indignation. I felt something strike the left rear of the car and I fumbled to keep it on the road. Glancing in the rear view mirror, I saw the gold and red eyes disappear into the fog, and I felt the tears flow freely from my eyes as I knew I couldn’t avoid it the next time. \n\nIn my head, I made the decision that if I saw everything pass by again, I would aim straight for the thing this time. If I was going out, I sure as hell was going to try and take it with me. I braced myself to see the park and church again. However, I was filled with shock when I saw the sign for the AutoZone light up the intersection in front of me. “Wha…” was all I could manage out as I flew through the intersection and past it. And the Rite Aid. And the sandwich shop. I glanced down at the dash and saw I was doing a hundred and ten as the Wal-Mart flew by on my left. *Was this a trick?* The answer came as I saw the lights of the gas station I had left flicker through the….*the lifting fog?* Yes, the ground fog was beginning to lift. I began to laugh, softly, still crying as I let my foot off the accelerator. My laughs sounded almost insane and I braked and pulled back into the gas station. I put the car in park and turned the engine off, my body shaking uncontrollably. I buried my face in my hands until a rap on the window caused me to shriek out and fumble for the keys. *It’s here, it was a trick! It…*it wasn’t. It was the attendant. He motioned for me to roll my window down, and I slowly did.\n\n“Hey, you got back here just in time; the computers are ba-“ He stopped as he caught sight of the state of me. “Hey, are you okay, buddy?” he asked gently, putting a hand on the door sill. What could I possibly say? If I told him the truth, as much as I wanted, he’d never believe me. Hell, *I* wouldn’t have believed me unless I’d just gone through what I had. I wiped my eyes with the sleeve of my jacket and pulled out the two twenties I had, trying to keep my voice from shaking. “Y-yeah”, I stammered a bit, “Just had a near miss on the road, scared the hell out of me”. I held out the money to him. “Can, I just get forty dollars of regular, please?” He took the money, still looking hard at me, then looked at the rear of my car. “Looks like you had more than just a near miss” he finally said. I stared at him in confusion, and he gestured for me to get out of the car and look. I stepped out on shaky legs, and thankfully had the door to grab onto as they almost gave out on me as I saw what he’d meant. \n\nDug into the left rear quarter panel of the car, just behind the gas cap, were three tears in the metal. They were deep and evenly spaced apart. *No, not tears*, I realized as I stared at them. *Claw marks*. I kept staring at them as the attendant filled my car up, then snapped out of it as he handed my receipt, giving me a last hard look. As I turned to get back in the car, he called out one final thing. “Try not to drive in the fog again. I’ve seen too many people get taken by it!” I turned back to ask him what he meant, but he’d already shut the door to his booth.\n\nNow it’s a few days later. I know I’ll never understand what I stumbled upon, or what that *thing* was. And frankly, I don’t want to. I already deal with enough nightmares from the little I experienced. When I see the ground fog roll in now, I close my blinds up tight and stay inside. And I will never drive late at night again. If you do, please, be careful. And whatever you do, don’t drive when the ground fog rolls in.",

        "text": "It was a dark and stormy night when I first experienced sleep paralysis. I had always heard about it before, but never thought that it would happen to me. Anyhow, I lay in bed, listening to the rain tap onto my window lightly. After a few minutes, I fell asleep. Suddenly, I woke up in the middle of the night, unable to move or even speak. I felt a heavy weight pressing down on my chest. I opened my eyes and saw a shadowy figure standing at the foot of my bed, its faceless features standing out in the darkness.\n\nI tried to scream for help, but no sound came out. The figure seemed to laugh at my helplessness, and I could feel its presence weighing on me like a physical force. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before, and I knew that something was terribly wrong. I tried my hardest to move but I just couldn’t. Suddenly, as quick as the mysterious figure came, he disappeared. I sat up, sweating and able to move again.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the sleep paralysis episodes continued to occur with increasing frequency. I would wake up in the middle of the night, unable to move or speak, and see the same shadowy figure hovering over me. It was always watching, always waiting.\n\nAt first, I thought that I was just experiencing a strange phenomenon that had no logical explanation. But as the days went by, I began to feel as though there was something sinister behind it all. The figure in my dreams began to appear to me in the waking world, following me wherever I went. You can call me crazy or whatever the hell you like, but I saw it for sure.\n\nI could see it out of the corner of my eye, lurking in the shadows and always just out of reach, moving fast enough to escape my sight. It was like a living nightmare that I couldn't escape from. I tried to ignore it, but it was always there, a constant reminder of the terror that I had experienced during the sleep paralysis episodes. That dread I experienced was now there constantly, I could never be relaxed.\n\nI became increasingly paranoid and sleep-deprived, unable to shake the feeling that I was being watched at all times. It was like the entity was stalking me, waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\nMy friends and family noticed the change in me and became worried. They urged me to seek help, but I knew that they wouldn't understand the gravity of the situation. How could they when they had never experienced something so otherworldly and terrifying?\n\nI began to feel like I was losing my mind. The figure seemed to be playing with my thoughts, distorting my perception of reality. I couldn't trust my own senses anymore, and the fear of what it might do next paralyzed me.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I was consumed by the dread of not knowing when the shadowy figure would strike again. Every creak and groan in the house made me jump, and every shadow seemed to hide the sinister figure. To the point, I was even scared from my own shadow.\n\nI knew that I had to do something to regain control of my life, but I didn't know where to turn. I felt like I was on the brink of a nervous breakdown, and the thought of succumbing to the entity's influence terrified me.\n\nFinally, I reached my breaking point. I knew that I couldn't go on like this any longer. With my mind made up, I decided that it was time to confront the figure that had been haunting me for so long. I gathered all the courage I could muster and waited until nightfall. As I lay in bed, I closed my eyes and tried to visualize the figure, willing it to appear before me.\n\nAt first, there was nothing but silence. Then, I felt a cold breeze brush against my cheek, and I knew that the figure was there. I opened my eyes slowly, afraid of what I might see. However, I didn’t see anything. Not even my room in fact. Just a black void. There was this constant thumping sound in the background, almost like a beating heart but it was too irregular. And there it was, the Entity. It didn’t have a complete physical form besides its eyes that peered out from the darkness, its malevolent energy pulsing through the void.\n\nI tried to speak, but my voice caught in my throat. The entity seemed to be waiting for me to make a move, and I knew that I had to act fast. With all my strength, I raised my arm and pointed at the entity, screaming at it.\n\n“WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!? JUST LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE!!!”\n\nBut as soon as I did, I felt a sudden jolt of fear shoot through my body. The entity's eyes seemed to bore into mine, and I could feel its power growing stronger by the second. I was overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness, and I knew that I was in way over my head.\n\nJust when I thought that all hope was lost, a mysterious force suddenly entered the room. I felt a bright light shining down on me, and the entity seemed to recoil in terror. With a final scream, it vanished into thin air, leaving me alone in the darkness.\n\nI was shaking with fear, but at the same time, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. The entity was gone, and I was finally free. But who or what had saved me from its clutches? I knew that I would never know for sure, but I was grateful nonetheless.\n\nFrom that day on, I was finally able to get a good night's sleep, and I was no longer haunted by the shadowy figure that had been stalking me for so long. But the memory of that terrifying encounter would stay with me forever, a constant reminder of the dark forces that lurked in the shadows, waiting to strike at any moment. I just wanted to get this off my chest so I could completely relax and help anyone who could have been in the same situation as me.",

        "text": "It's happening so slow, I don't know what to do, my heart is pounding I'm being watched. \nThrowback to around 6 months earlier, me and my friend, we were walking to my house when we saw a man looking at the sky, it was around 8pm and it was dark. We didn't think much about him, we just went past him, but he never moved just like he was hypnotised. He stood there for a good while but he never moved at least i remeber it like that.\nNow im sitting on my bed and he's watching my window. He is tall and skinny, i live near a big graveyard and I've experienced a lot of \"dark masses\"? Like these normal in church every sunday but these sounded... weird... \nNow back to that guy, i thought that he was baiting and his friend is looting my home but nothing downstairs. As i came back to my room, HE IS GONE.\n\nOn the videos I don't see anything but after some filters... Well i do seem to see anything. Please let there be a chance for me to update this...\n\nSomebody just took off with a great speed, it could be our local roadman type hooligans, it's Poland... For example in Cracow they run with machetes, here you can get stabbed in a assassin's Creed style.\nHe dissapearded and i can't see the road near my house, my father is out of the country driving trucks. My mother is asleep and i have my arm in a denture. I have a dog that is higher than 1.8m when standing on his hind legs but ffs i can't do anything.\n\nI live near cementery, might that be somebody who got possessed? He was standing perfectly in line to me. Near my neighbors fence perfectly staring into my room.\nHe couldn't be sleep walking right? I couldn't see his face, in fact i never did. The hell, i never saw his face now I know, i never did. I didn't saw his face 6 months ago neither did I today. Maybe IT didn't have a face? How come it took me as it's target? Why, why me?\n\nIt didn't have a face, video and pictures of poor quality. Never got a good look of him. What could it be? Maybe a skinwalker? No, no it couldn't be, i could be dead by now. Where did he go, where?!\n\nAs of 2:21 am, he is not there. Heard a lot of weird stuff, i don't have a cross in my room or any other crucifix.\nAll that stress, everything makes me tired and dizzy, i can't think straight nor i can go to sleep... Heh sleep I think it's the last thing I need for now. Maybe I'll be alive in the morning, maybe possessed like that thing, who knows there will be an update or will not be. I could send these videos on dms, but please help me identify what that could be, it couldn't be a skinwalker, could be?\n\nWait, why is my dog so quiet?",

        "text": "I started working as a nighttime mall security guard. I found a strange list of rules.\n\nLet me start by saying i was always a big guy. I reached puberty very early and was a tall muscular guy. So, it made sense that i had picked up a career in security. I was getting desperate for money, and this mall was as old as they could come. Built in the 30’s, and it had been rebuilt multiple times. It had just been rebuilt for the 4th time, and they put up a help wanted sign for nighttime security positions. I didn’t have any family that i needed to care for, so i didn’t mind working a night shift. I got into my car and drove over to the mall, which was called “Nenkai Mall” named after the county it was built in. It was around 9:00 PM,\nafter the mall had closed. The ad said to prepare to work the same day you apply, so that’s why i came so late. I went to the front door and arrived at the same time as another person who wanted a security position. We struggled to make conversation as we were both introverted i suppose. But his name was Todd and we became friends in a small amount of time. The boss arrived and let us in shortly after and led us into his office. He gave us a short interview separately and said we both made the cut, and we could start working today. He provided us uniforms and told us to get changed and walk back to his office, he left the mens room unlocked. On my way to the mens room i could have sworn i saw my father but i guess it was the lack of sleep from gaming all night last night. I went back a few minutes after Todd, and the boss handed me a employee guide book. He decided to give me a 9mm pistol, due to the fact i was going to be a police officer. I went through training but opted out last minute. I put the holster on my pants and followed the boss as he led us to the office. He seemed panicked and rushed us in and wished us good luck and said he’d be leaving now. I looked at Todd and we both agreed on reading the guidebook now rather then later. After flipping through stuff about burglaries and security camera usage we came across a page that was labeled as very important and required to read. I skimmed over it and it looked like a list of rules to follow. “Finally” i thought, having been looking for this particular page for the past 10 minutes. I started to read the ruleset after telling Todd to focus as get off his phone. \n\n“Hello new employee(s). Welcome to your new position in mall security here at Nenkai Mall. Here are a list of rules and a few minor inconveniences to be aware of and address. Please make sure you follow all of the rules.” I scoffed at the fact they said it was a new security position, like i hadn’t had 100 jobs like this before. \n“Rule 1: Please make regular sweeps of the premises every 2 hours. Sometimes they get inside the premises.\n\nRule 2: If you see someone you recognize inside of the building, you have about 1 hour to get rid of it before it lets the rest of them in. They are near and waiting for approval from their intruder to enter the building.\n\n2a: They will slaughter you if they come into contact with you, make sure you slaughter them first. \n\nRule 3: You will hear screams some time throughout the night. Just ignore them and don’t leave the office within the next 30 minutes. They are hungry.\n\nRule 4: Please shoot any customers you see wandering the mall as if they were shopping. They aren’t real humans and are trying to unlock the doors. \n\nRule 5: There are pianos in the mall. If you hear them go play by themselves calmly walk to the piano and close it, if it plays for too long they take it as a invitation to come inside and your safety is compromised.\n\nRule 6: Please do not look at any writing in ancient symbols. They wrote it to communicate and you will go insane trying to comprehend it, and you will need to be terminated. \n\n\nRule 7: Do not tell anyone about what happens in this mall after hours. They don’t like to be acknowledged and will hunt you down.\n\nRule 8: Don’t listen to the faceless children that come by your office looking for their parents.

        "text": "It started with a recipe. A new recipe that promised to be the most delicious pasta dish you'd ever tasted. It was called the Unsettling Recipe, and it had been making the rounds on the internet for a few weeks.\n\nPeople were raving about it, saying that it was unlike anything they had ever tasted. Some even claimed that it had changed their lives. As a lover of pasta, I was intrigued.\n\nI searched the web for the recipe and found it on a cooking blog. The ingredients called for things that most people had never heard of: black garlic, squid ink pasta, and a rare type of mushroom that only grew in a remote forest.\n\nBut I was curious, and so I decided to give it a try. I gathered all of the ingredients, including a few that I had to order online, and set to work in the kitchen.\n\nAs I prepared the dish, I started to feel uneasy. The air in my kitchen felt thick and heavy, and there was a strange smell that I couldn't quite identify. But I pushed through, determined to see this recipe through to the end.\n\nWhen I finally sat down to eat, I immediately regretted my decision. The pasta was chewy and bitter, and the sauce tasted like ash. But it was the feeling that came over me that was the most unsettling.\n\nAs I ate, I felt like something was watching me. Like there was a presence in the room with me. I tried to shake it off, thinking that I was just being paranoid. But the feeling persisted, growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nAnd then, I started to hear whispers. Whispers that seemed to be coming from the pasta itself. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but I could tell that they were not friendly.\n\nI tried to ignore it, thinking that it was just my imagination. But then, I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. When I turned to look, I saw that the strands of pasta on my plate were writhing and twisting, like they were alive.\n\nI tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move. The whispers grew louder, filling my head with their sinister words. And then, I felt something wrap around my ankle.\n\nI looked down, and I saw that the pasta had crawled out of my plate and was now wrapping itself around my leg, pulling me towards it. I screamed and kicked, but it was too strong. It dragged me towards it, and then it consumed me.\n\nThe last thing I remember was the feeling of the pasta sliding down my throat, choking me. And then, everything went dark.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in a hospital bed. The doctors told me that I had suffered a severe allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in the recipe. But I knew that it was more than that. I knew that something had been in that pasta, something dark and sinister.\n\nI became obsessed with the Unsettling Recipe, scouring the internet for any information I could find about it. I discovered that there were others who had experienced similar things when they ate it.\n\nSome claimed that the pasta had taken on a life of its own, that it had crawled out of their plates and attacked them. Others said that they had heard whispers, just like I had. And still others claimed that they had seen things in the pasta, things that shouldn't be there.\n\nI knew that I had to get to the bottom of this. I had to find out who had created the Unsettling Recipe, and why. My search led me to a dark corner of the internet, a place where people shared recipes and secrets that were too dangerous for the mainstream.\n\nThere, I found the creator of the Unsettling Recipe, a mysterious figure known only as \"The Pasta Maker\". I contacted him, hoping that he could shed some light on what had happened to me.\n\nTo my surprise, he responded almost immediately. He was cordial and friendly, answering all of my questions about the recipe and its ingredients. But there was something about him that made me uneasy, like he was hiding something.\n\nI pressed him for more information, asking him about the whispers and the movement in the pasta. But he just laughed it off, saying that it was all in my head. I wasn't satisfied with his answer, and so I continued to dig. I searched for anyone who had ever worked with The Pasta Maker, hoping to find someone who could confirm my suspicions.\n\nFinally, I found someone. A former assistant to The Pasta Maker, who had worked with him on the Unsettling Recipe. I contacted her, hoping that she could give me some answers. She was hesitant to speak with me at first, but eventually, she relented. And what she told me was even more unsettling than I could have imagined. According to her, The Pasta Maker had made a deal with a dark entity, one that required him to use certain ingredients in his recipes. These ingredients were not just rare or hard to find, but they were infused with a sinister energy that could be harnessed for dark purposes. The Pasta Maker had used these ingredients in the Unsettling Recipe, creating a dish that was more than just food. It was a gateway to another realm, a place where the entity could manifest and wreak havoc on unsuspecting diners.\n\nI was horrified by what she had told me, but I knew that I had to act. I couldn't let The Pasta Maker continue to create these recipes, putting people's lives at risk. I contacted the authorities, giving them all of the information that I had gathered. They launched an investigation, and soon after, The Pasta Maker was arrested. But even with him behind bars, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to the Unsettling Recipe. Something that I hadn't uncovered yet.\n\nWeeks past, I reluctantly sat at my desk scouring the internet for something to entertain myself. Until I received an email. It was from The Pasta Maker, and it contained a new recipe. A recipe for something called \"The Ultimate Pasta\". I knew that I shouldn't have opened it, but my curiosity got the better of me. I clicked on the link, and the recipe opened up. As I read through it, I felt that same feeling of unease washing over me. The ingredients were even more rare and exotic than those in the Unsettling Recipe, and the instructions were filled with cryptic warnings and strange symbols.\n\nAnd then, I heard whispers. Whispers that seemed to be coming from my computer screen.\n\nI looked up, and I saw movement. Movement in the pasta on the plate next to me.\n\nI knew that I had to destroy the recipe, to delete the email and never look at it again. But something was holding me back. Something dark and sinister.\n\nI heard The Pasta Maker's voice in my head. He was laughing, telling me that I had fallen into his trap once again. I tried to resist, but it was too late. The whispers grew louder, and the pasta on my plate started to writhe and twist, just like before. I knew that I was in danger, that I had to act fast. But I couldn't move. I was paralyzed, consumed by the darkness that had overtaken me.\n\nAnd then, everything went dark.",

        "text": "I think the biggest misconception about The Devil—as we presently mundane beings know him—is that he’d *need* us to do his bidding, to carry out his will. The real idiots believe him to be some near-equal rival to God, ever-engaged in a grand cosmic war, with Earth as its theater; us as the spiritually malleable players. But that, scripturally and even logically, is false. Neither is he some cool, sorcerous libertine, uninterested in Holy Affairs yet never quite ignorant enough to miss out on spoiling them when the occasion for mischief arises. He is, in every sense of the word, a prisoner; doomed to an eternal sentence in the Hadean depths, the everblack pit, Stygian and smoldering and inescapable.  \n\nBut he’s still Satan, still The Adversary—just not to God. He’s *our* antagonist, and in no way does he care for us, and he certainly doesn’t need us. I’m belaboring over this explanation, this *proper* identification of The Fallen One, for this simple reason: to impart the idea—the fact—that those in power, those who overseer and rule us, are not in league with the undivine one. They have no accord with him; the atrocities they allegedly conduct do not gain for them further influence or power that their perfectly human means wouldn’t have otherwise begat. They defile and destroy, sure; but it’s not getting them anything from him, from below. They are LARPers, regardless of what they may or may not believe.  \n\nI have no love for Satan, and I certainly don’t respect him. But I would never underestimate him, nor reduce his diabolic machinations to be humanly amenable. His power—his influence—is insidious, pervasive. **Eroding.** No human may deal with him equally, and certainly not profitably. He hates us—he is not a liberator.  \n\nYou can slit throats and open bellies as sacrificial pledges of allegiance to the sun—that won’t stop it from cooking your skin with cancer if it radioactively deigns to.  \n\nI learned this grave yet admittedly obvious truth in a rather unique and terrifying way, when I tried not to make a deal with the devil, but to opt out of one that had been made prior to my birth. Upon death, I wanted to be annihilated; I desired neither the unceasing, intoxicating bliss of Heaven nor the eternal agony of Hell. I just wanted oblivion—pure nonexistence, no existential or ontological remnants of my being. True, sterile and stagnant Death.  I've been so tired of existing, lately. So fed up with the dull, feasibly inescapable monotony of human life; the endless march towards death, which my ingrained-at-youth faith wouldn't let me believe was the end of existence. Being faced with a \"part two\" to life, one that would go on forever and ever...I just couldn't except it. \n\nSo, I called upon that Wretched One, the most (ironically) esteemed of the incarcerated, and offered him a lifetime of service in exchange for an eternity of nothing. I’d seen his “work” firsthand, his subtly wrought malignancy, and knew that he was not entirely powerless; more so only physically cut off from literally walking the Earth and spreading despair. But I also understood that I’d have to do most of the heavy lifting on the terrestrial side of things.  \n\nSeeing as how I wished for the utter destruction of my soul, I figured that he’d be happy to oblige. My spirit as some abstract item distinct from my corporeal vessel—or bolstering life-force—was useless to him, so he’d have no reason to demand it. My total eradication was more in line with his *true* goal: The end of mankind, his only way of getting back at the creator he’d so foolishly thought to depose. What he’d do upon the utter extinction of mankind is anyone’s guess. I certainly wouldn’t care—I'd be dead.  \n\nThrough means I won’t bother relating here—both for the sake of time and the necessary admission of heinous activities—I managed to book a nebulous meeting with that Chthonic fiend and lay out my intentions.  \n\nSeeing as how I was still mortal—and therefore susceptible to death and an *improper* afterlife—I paid him all the due “respect”, lest I incur that long-harbored wrath. Seeing the mutual benefit in my grim proposition, he heartily agreed, and supplied me with a few diabolical abilities and pieces of antediluvian knowledge I wouldn’t have otherwise been able to acquire, no matter how much money or ill-defined power I possessed. The site at which we’d held congress was then summarily sanitized by hell-fire, leaving naught but blackly scorched earth.  \n\nUsing these ultramundane tools, I was to wreak havoc upon my kind, and—if things went really well—augur the emergence of that *other* entity, who’d dare to contest Christ, despite the failure of past attempts.  \n\nBut life has a funny way to going a completely different direction than the one you’d envisioned, as the old saying commonly (and annoyingly) reminds us: *God laughs while you make plans.*  \n\nI was all set to incinerate a whole swath of people who’d gathered for some middling sporting event, when a man, mid-30s and dressed appropriately for the pre-spring weather came up to me and said, “If you could forestall that” (referring to the fiery orb growing in my palm) “for a moment, I’d be extremely grateful. There is something you should know, before continuing.” \n\nIt was the man’s inflection—more than his apparent knowledge of my intentions—that caused me to close my fist and extinguish the incendiary nova. He’d sounded as if the decimation of the crowd would be of no greater imposition than an impatient waiter’s latest inquiry into what he’d like to eat.  \n\nI was intrigued, so I waited for him to explain, while the game or match or whatever carried on beside us.  \n\nAs if he hadn’t the slightest worry of having no game to return to, he waved to someone in the crowd—a gesture which intimated, *be right back*—and said, “Well, we’re aware of the deal you made. And while I’m sure you think it’s smart, maybe even genius, it just won’t work like that. He’s the Destroyer, sure—but souls aren’t something he can destroy. He can rend and tear and blast to his black heart’s content, but you—your spirit—will persist; and you’ll just have earned yourself a spot right by him, in you-know-where. So, I suggest you just relinquish these powers of yours and go about your regular life.....maybe attend Mass once in a while.”  \n\nI balked at him; I somehow hadn’t thought I could be deceived, not so lamely.  \n\n“So, you’re what, an emissary? An angel sent to show me the right path?”  \n\nThe man visibly cringed, a response a normal man would’ve had at seeing someone holding a ball of fire in their hands.  \n\n“Oh no, not at all. Let’s just say I’m a very interested third party, and that I’m thoroughly, unfortunately familiar with the Adversary’s business model. Earth is a big place, but it alone will never fill Hell. There’s a lot of acreage up, down, around there—the purported geometry differs from place to place. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s actually limitless, given mannkind’s propesnity for procreation, and the domain’s intent. So long as men and sin exist, there’ll be room in Hell.”   \n\nA whistle signaled the end of *something,* and the two teams—who'd been amateurishly or professionally competing, I couldn’t say which—broke away from the field to convene at their respective sidelines. My unannounced and unallied interlocutor smiled, then promptly rejoined those he’d left behind. \n\nThrough the same occult and urelatable affairs, I managed to once again gain an audience with The Dragon. Obviously, he was not happy with my violation of our agreement, and swore to, well, himself, that he’d ruin me; that my life from then on would be hideously, deliciously awful. But a casual invocation of Christ’s name sent the ophidian offender shrinking away, the flame-rimmed portal blinking out of terrestrial occupancy like a popped balloon.  \n\nI was still terrified, considering that I had literally conversed with the devil not once, but twice; and had in the second instance angered him enough to warrant his personal intervention in every moment of happiness of my life. I believe in God and his sovereignty, but unlike Satan, terror *actually* poses a considerable threat to my faith in the Lord’s ever-vigilant care. \n\nBut I nonetheless continued with my life, considering myself “lucky” to have dealt with the devil and lived to ruminate upon the theological implications. It wasn’t until a few weeks later—when I’d successfully though foolishly forgotten my sub-surface teleconference with unenviable one—that I reaped what I’d sown.  \n\nWhile reading a Greg Egan story and understanding very little of the mathemetical exposition-dumping—but nonetheless enjoying the story for its broader Sci-Fi allure—the floor of my apartment collapsed, revealing a flaming pit below. This was both terrifying and bewildering, seeing as how I live on the fourth floor, and would’ve felt if not heard the eruption of the Earth beneath the complex.  \n\nGlued to my lounge chair in a paralazying fear, I watched as a black, shadowy, and thorn-lined tendril rose from out of the pit, leaving in its wake tufts and motes of inky darkness, like Hadean spores. Even though the pit smoldered with a sallow haze and belched visible fumes, I felt no heat; and neither were there any noticeable effects upon the apartment itself, beyond where the rupture had come through in the floor.  \n\nThe disconcertingly ophidian tendril rose to the ceiling, where it stained the surface blackly; spreading itself like a prodigous weed. Despite the utter lack of anthropomorphic identifiers, I felt as if this thing were in some way sentient, as if I stared at a sinister intelligence come to wreak havoc upon my life.  \n\nIntuition proved true. The thing, after streaking itself haphazardly across the ceiling and down the walls, spoke to me; it’s voice grave and sonically Tartarean:  \n\n“You wished for oblivion. I would’ve given that to you, but you defied me. Reneged on our deal. You think *He* can protect you? While you are here on this Earth, you are up for grabs, as you’d say. This is as much my territory as His, in the bidding for souls. And now, I will grant you that wish, though not in the fashion you’d think.”  \n\nWithout waiting for a response from me—not that I would’ve been able to provide one in my thoughtless shock—a limb of that Stygian stalk shot out, impaling me in the forehead. There was a brief but unforgettable moment of searing, white-hot agony, and then my mind rebooted itself. I awoke on the floor sometime later, directly on the spot where there’d once been a smoking aperture to Hell itself.  \n\nKnowing that the experience hadn’t simply been a hyper-real nightmare, but seeing no physical evidence of it having occurred, I went to the bathroom to wash my face off and give my mind some more time to accept what had happened. It was then that I saw the strange rune that had been seared into my forehead by the mind-probing tendril. To try and describe its shape would be futile; I've never seen anything like it, and doubt that any artist could truly replicate its form and style. It’s one of those things that can only be seen, but never described or reproduced regardless of how faithful an attempt to do so may be.  \n\nWanting—desperately needing—a bit of fresh air, I left my apartment. It wasn’t until I tried to buy a pack of gum at a stall that I noticed my sudden anonymity. I asked the vendor for a pack, but he provided no response; and even dealt with another customer immediately behind me. As politely as I could, I tried to interrupt the two men, but neither paid me any mind. Frustrated, I walked away, and on a crypitc hunch, asked a passerby for the time. They seemed to ignore me as well, as if they hadn’t heard me.  \n\nAfter a few more tests of this nature I realized that I was invisible—that I'd been rendered totally inconspicuous. Not physically immaterial, as was testified by the fact that I hadn’t slipped through the Earth upon waking. But otherwise, undetectable by my fellow human beings. The dark irony of the situation nearly sent me falling to the floor; I’d been given my own dose of mundane oblivion: invisible to everyone, socially nonexistent. It wasn’t *thoughtless,* it wasn’t an enternal immateriality—but close enough, in a wicked trickster’s eyes.  \n\nAs I mentioned before, I can still physically interact with the real world, and have thus typed up this record of my experience. I guess it can serve as a warning to those who would make a deal with the devil and not follow through. If you’re gonna make such a foolish, existentially damning decision, at least get the job done.  \n\nPerhaps that ambiguously identified third party can help me? Who knows. But I'd certainly take Heaven over this.",

        "text": "(First: https://redd.it/111m676 Previous: https://redd.it/119h6gc )\nI’ve been exhausted from not sleeping when an odd call came. It was only two days after the Hunter ordeal. The cuts and bruises looked better but were still healing. I assumed the call to be for another job, but for some reason I’d been asked to meet with The Hunter that almost took my life. \n\nHe was the one who requested the meeting, and I could refuse. Jackalope wasn’t very keen on the fact I accepted, but he didn’t try to stop me from leaving that day. I was swept away to a very plain building where the man was being held. It wasn’t a prison. It looked more like a mixture of an office building and apartments. They didn’t even ask me to remove any metal or dangerous items. Soon, I found myself sitting across from a man who shot me. The room was empty besides a table between us. \n\nHis face also started healing up from the few good hits I’d gotten in during our fight. His hands bound with simple cuffs. There wasn’t anyone inside the room beside us, but I knew this meeting was being watched in some way. I learned his name was Sebastian. They did not tell me his last name for some reason. \n\n“Are they treating you well?” I asked unsure of where to start. \n\nHe nodded, refusing to meet my eyes. He fiddled with his hands and his foot tapped against the floor. I didn’t have the slightest clue what he wanted to see me about. He chewed on his lip for a while. Just as I was about to leave, he spoke. \n\n“You’re... human, right?” He said in a low voice. \n\nIt sounded like he hadn’t been drinking enough water. I worried he didn’t trust the food or drink here. He did think The Corporation was only killing monsters that ate too much, and not for the overall good of the human race. \n\n“Yeah. It’s the reason why your magic sword didn’t work.” I answered. \n\nI wondered what might happen to him now. No one had given me a straight answer on his future. They did want to offer him a job hunting down monsters for The Corporation, but I highly doubted he would accept. There was hope that after he’d been arrested that the mysterious death of the monsters missing organs would stop. He’d only been locked away for a day before yet another murdered monster was found. That proved he wasn’t responsible for the rest of the murders and only killed the werewolf as a trap. \n\n“Why are you working with them?” The man pressed finally looking in my direction. \n\n“I know how you feel about The Corporation. I don’t like parts of it either. A supernatural creature saved my life and it led me down this path.” I started. \n\nHe didn’t like the answer and scowled. Shaking his head, his foot tapped harder against the ground clearly annoyed I let him down in some way. \n\n“They set you up. They wanted something and tricked you into being loyal. They just-” \n\n“Jackalope offered his life to save mine. He was willing to die for a stranger. It’s a miracle he’s alive and only lost an arm.” I cut in sternly. \n\nHis foot-tapping stopped. Sebastian stared me down with dark tired eyes looking for a lie. When he saw nothing but the truth, I saw gears turning in his head. He didn’t want to admit there might be good monsters out there. He needed to believe that all supernatural creatures were bloodthirsty monsters because he’d killed so many without a second thought. If there was a decent creature, that meant he may have killed a good person at some point. \n\n“I don’t have any proof of what I’m saying. And I won’t sit here judging you for your actions. There must have been a good reason for you to go down the path you choose.” I told him. \n\nHe refused to look at me as I spoke. His eyes set on the floor as if he could drown out his thoughts. He dug the tips of his fingernails under each other making me wince. \n\n“I wasn’t wrong. They needed to die. I was never wrong.” He muttered to himself.  \n\n“I don’t think you were ever wrong. I’m not angry about what you did. A little on Nessie’s behalf, but... I just feel as if you’re hurting yourself more than the creatures you hunted.” \n\nHis tapping stopped again. Soon his shoulders started to tremble as he buried his head into his hands. He looked so worn down and broken at that moment. His body became strong for hunting creatures but the moment he stopped to look at what he was doing, he nearly shattered. \n\n“They killed my daughter. Ate her. What else was I supposed to do?” Sebastian said, his voice hoarse and barely a whisper. \n\n“I’m sorry.” \n\nI fully meant those words. I couldn’t offer anything else. There was no right answer when it came to all of this. Humans and the supernatural couldn’t co-exist without there being causalities. Sebastian was one of them. I considered if it would be better if our two species never interacted. The creatures would starve, but there would be no little girls getting eaten. No Gods killing loved ones. And no need for Agents to give up their arms to the darkness. \n\nA tap on the door signalled the meeting was over. I stood up but told Sebastian we could talk whenever he wanted. I didn’t know if he wanted to ever see me again or disappear back into the frame of mind that kept him going. Everything was much easier to deal with when you thought every monster was a killer. \n\nI walked down the hallway but was stopped by someone. A tall man came in my direction. He barely looked like an adult. His white hair was cut short at the sides and wavy at the front. He wore a baggy sweater that made him appear thinner. Old scars circled his entire nick as if someone tried cutting his head off with a wire and failed. He had a calm smile that overpowered the fear I got when I saw his red eyes. \n\n“Thank you for meeting with him. I’m the one in charge of his case. It must have been hard on both of you.” The newcomer said in a kind tone. \n\nDidn’t Robin mention that The Silver King was the one who would look over Sebastian's case? I looked him up and down deciding he did not give off the air of an all-powerful creature all others bowed down to.  \n\n“What’s going to happen to him?” I asked. \n\n“Well... Therapy to start. Aside from that, it’s up to him. We’ll provide all his needs. I don’t think someone can recover from what he’s been through. He has support from us no matter what happens.” He explained as he brushed some hair from his eyes. \n\n“He was a Hunter. He killed monsters. And there is no way to prove all the ones he killed deserved it. The ones he did wrong are just going to take care of him as if that never happened?” I asked, really hoping that would be the case. \n\nThe man paused to think. He had his hands behind his back, and he rocked on his heels for a few seconds. \n\n“A monster killed his family. He killed monsters. If we killed him, that would feed into an endless cycle. Some say it would balance things out but... I hate balanced things. Being balanced isn’t always the right answer. We’ll take care of him. He’s gone through enough, he doesn’t need to deal with more monsters.” \n\nI wanted to respond but he heard his name being called from down the hallway. He was a very busy person. He thanked me again for coming by that day and hurried off to do whatever he needed to. The meeting was depressing, but at least it gave me a break from Jackalope forcing food on me to gain some weight. \n\nBy the time my injuries finally healed I was ready to get back to work. The lights stayed on at night, but I still didn’t sleep much. There hadn’t been any sightings of whatever haunted the dark, but I still didn’t want to risk turning off the lights just yet. I wondered if Jackalope was sleeping all right. He acted a bit slower than normal but just said he’d been doing a lot of running at work. \n\nA job request came in and of course, Jackalope said I wasn’t ready to go back. I brushed off his worries. If I stayed inside the house for too long, I may go insane. I quickly found out I didn’t really like any movies or shows on my handful of streaming services. Reading put me to sleep and Jackalope beat me to cleaning most of the house. The only choice was to accept the first job that came my way. \n\nI ended up in a town so small a single police department of three oversaw the entire population. The job was simple. A woman was found dead, and they needed someone to record the scene. They also requested I train two of the officers up on some new databases along with reviewing how to deal with murder scenes. They didn’t have them often and needed a refresher. I would not be working with an Agent which made me nervous. But I was given my CSI jacket that had some mild magic protection. \n\nMy jacket also helped with the insanely low temperatures. Cold weather and I did not mix well. I huddled under my jacket shivering. The Corporation provided a rented car and dumped me into a snow-covered town trusting I found my way around. With a lot of backtracking, I found the dirt road leading to a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. An officer met me outside. He waited for a long time and was a bit annoyed by how long I took. \n\nHe was ridiculously tall. His skin dark and hair black. He didn’t smile but held out a hand for me to shake when I arrived. \n\n“I’m Yates. You’re the FED, right?” He asked after we shook hands. His voice low and raspy as if he had a cold. \n\nMy cover story was that I worked with the FBI to recover evidence because the murder was suspected to be part of an ongoing investigation. I flashed the fake badge I’d been given to sell that story a bit better. Yates did not like the fact that someone swooped in to take over a murder scene in his town. He showed a coldness that matched the weather. \n\n“I’m here to help. I’ll gather what I need. I wished I was notified before the body had been collected.” I admitted looking over his shoulder and towards the house. \n\nThe body had been found outside, torn apart and half eaten. The blood remained for me to document along with anything else I may find. The front door was open when the body had been found but had since been closed to stop snow from entering the house. Yates gave me the basic rundown of what happened before I arrived. \n\nAnother officer named Maggie had been the one to find the poor dead girl. They had been friends so Yates took over meeting me and guarding the scene. Maggie and Yates were the ones who needed the lesson when we got back to the department. He warned me she was very stressed out after what she saw and might not be the best student. I asked him about tire tracks, who walked over the scene, and what kind of wildlife may be in the area. \n\nHe provided a photo of the bite marks on the body. I wasn’t aware of any animal that may have eaten half a body in such a way. As I got started on the scene, I didn't see any tracks in the knee-deep snow of an animal coming from the woods. So far, there had only been some tire tracks, and a path made by an unknown number of people through the snow and toward the front of the house. The lack of tracks from the woods made me think that something not natural was the cause of the death. \n\nYates did a good job documenting the scene before I arrived. I wanted to get out of the cold wind and snow as soon as possible. My hands shook making it hard to write down notes and keep my camera steady. A gust of wind made me flinch and turn my head away. When I opened my eyes, I stared off into the nearby forest. I could have sworn I saw a set of eyes staring back.. \n\nA hot puff of air hit the back of my neck. I knew right away it wasn’t the wind. \n\n“Agent, leave.” \n\nThe two words were nothing but a hoarse whisper. I turned as fast as possible to see nothing. Yates stood near his patrol car still, not noticing anything. I wasn’t sure if I imagined the voice, but the fear felt real. I took the words as a threat. I could listen to the warning, or I could finish up my job. Within the hour we were driving back to the department ready to start the training so I could leave. \n\nA blast of heat hit my face the moment we walked into the building. The cold from my face faded within seconds of being inside. If I didn’t take off my jacket, I would have died from a heat stroke. \n\n“Sorry, the heater’s broken. I take it you’re the guy helping us on Laura’s case?” \n\nThe only female officer met us by the door. She helped with my jacket on reflex to hang it up by the door. The building only had a main room, an office, and jail cells in the back. The computers looked to be at least fifteen years old. At least they still worked. I introduced myself to Maggie who tried her best to appear upbeat. Her mood was forced which was understandable. She was pretty in a plain way. A round face with messy blonde hair tied back. If she smiled, she would look like the perfect girl next door. \n\nA man came out of the only enclosed office. He also wore a uniform that he kept buttoned up as if he was affected by the heat of the building. \n\n“So, you’re the FED. I didn’t know they came in your color.” He said in a deep voice. \n\nI bristled at the comment but kept calm. The man was the Sheriff of the small town. He looked like any backwoods cop should. Overweight, too old for the job, and a mysterious food stain on his shirt. I glanced over at Yates who gave the man an open glare. I bet he got the same kind of abuse from this man due to his darker skin tone. \n\n“Good thing you’re retiring or else comments like that would get you fired.” Yates hissed in his raspy voice. \n\nThe Sheriff crossed his arms, ready for a fight. A handgun was a clear threat on his belt. Thank God Maggie was good at dealing with these two. She quickly brought attention away from the future fight. \n\n“This is Ward. He does like to say things to mess with people. As Yates said, he’ll be retiring soon. Let’s get started on that training so you can hurry on home.” \n\nMaggie guided us to the computer desk and thankfully the two men didn’t get into it again. Ward refused to join us and locked himself away in his office. I didn’t want to bring up the tense work environment. We just focused on getting the computer software up to speed and the two officers caught up on a lot of protocols they lacked. Yates was quiet, but he understood the material. Maggie needed some extra help and acted a bit embarrassed by it. She didn’t have a cellphone until recently, so all of this was pretty new to her. It was taking longer than expected, but I wasn’t upset over that fact. I just would be late for dinner. \n\nAs we worked away, I noticed the weather outside had gotten bad. Sheets of snow made the world outside appear to be pure white. The wind blew hard, and I was glad to be inside a warm building. Just as I wanted to wrap things up for the day, an alarm went off. Maggie flew into action and raced towards the noise with Yates close behind. \n\nI smelled the reason for the alarm and followed them. I paused in the doorway that led to the back cells. A small fire started on the beds inside the second of the two cells. Maggie grabbed an extinguisher to easily put out the small flames. We all looked at each other very puzzled over how such a fire started. \n\nI noticed something the others hadn’t. The fire burned an almost perfect circle in the middle of the bed. Something clicked in my head, and I turned on my heels to go to the front door. Maggie asked questions as I left. Ward came out of his office and watched me pause at the front door. My CSI jacket with my cellphone missing with a small fading circle on the hook it had been placed on. I then braved the storm outside long enough to confirm that our cars were missing. Yates grabbed my shoulder to drag me back inside. My clothing was covered in snow from being outside for under a minute. \n\n“What’s going on? Maggie asked confused. \n\n“The cars are gone. Check the phones.” I told her as I went over to the computer. \n\n“Gone? What are you on about?” Ward asked huffing towards the door. \n\nMaggie checked the first phone near her, and when she didn’t even hear a dial tone, she moved on to the next one. The computer screen turned to static, then died the moment I went over to it. Ward didn’t want to believe the cards had been stolen. He was convinced I just didn’t see them through the snow. No one went to force him back inside. He spent the next ten minutes going inside and out in denial. \n\nYates and Maggie both owned cell phones. They both died like the computer. I’ve seen this before. I made the mistake of bringing along my personal cell phone to a scene with a monster corpse. It was fried in seconds from the magic still in the air. \n\nSomeone here started the fire with magic to distract us away from the missing cars, and my jacket being stolen. Whoever did so, was strong enough to be able to control their magic so the computer didn’t die sooner. And they knew who I worked for. But they assumed I was an Agent instead of just a human CSI worker. \n\n“Seriously, what’s going on?” Maggie asked, unable to keep the fear from her voice. \n\nI couldn’t answer her. Someone here wasn’t human and kept us trapped for a reason I wasn’t certain of just yet. Maggie was either very good at acting, or just as scared as I was. I considered Yates, but he hadn’t moved to the farmhouse when I heard that voice. I wasn’t even entirely sure if that voice warning me to leave had anything to do with this case. I hadn’t been sleeping well and could have been hearing things. Ward didn’t seem to be the supernatural type, but he’d acted the most hostile out of all of them so far. I just didn’t have enough information to make the call. All I could do it wait. \n\n“Someone is going to notice they can’t get through to us and come to get us.” I said to Maggie but that thought didn’t comfort her. \n\n“I’ll make some coffee.” Yates announced. \n\nIt kept him busy while Ward cursed and swore at our current situation. He yelled, demanding answers. When none were given, he stormed back into his office. He slammed the door so hard I thought the glass may break. \n\nWithout anything else to do, I sat down to look over the case I’d been called to document. Maggie settled down with a mug of coffee in her hand. She came over to look over my shoulder. I quickly flipped over the photo of her friend’s dead body and looked up at her. \n\n“I'm sorry for what happened to her. Do you have any ideas on who would do this?” I asked her. \n\nShe gave a weak smile appreciating someone cared about the poor girl's death. \n\n“Not a clue. Everyone loved her. She fell on some hard times money-wise, but she owed money to the bank. No one else. But we think she was ambushed by some animal. After all,... What else would...” She stopped talking, her face pale. \n\nI let her look away but the expression on her face went beyond sadness her friend was killed and then her body was torn up. It was as if she had seen something. I gestured for her to sit next to me unsure of how to approach this topic.  \n\n“Are there any urban legends around here? Like dogmen or Bigfoot?” I asked in a hushed tone. \n\nIf Yates heard, he didn’t care. Maggie searched through her head but came up empty.  \n\n“Nothing much. We had a rumor of a serial killer but nothing that might try and eat a person.” She explained. \n\nAs she spoke, I took a piece of scrap paper and acted like I was taking notes. Instead of that, I wrote her a message. \n\n‘Did you see something?’ \n\nShe quickly read over my question. Face paler than ever. As she kept talking, she wrote down her response in a way no one else in the office would see. \n\n‘Monster. It wore a uniform jacket.’ \n\nShe handed back the paper and did another check to make sure we weren’t caught passing notes. No wonder she acted so stressed out. When she discovered the body, she saw something eating her friend. A creature that wore the same uniform as herself. I don’t know what happened or how she got away. Maggie acted relaxed and calm around Yates so she must have a reason to not suspect him. But now we were all stuck with a possible creature just waiting to do, what? What did that monster want? \n\nI did consider Maggie might have been lying. If she was the creature, she could be trying to pin her crimes on her co-workers. She knew I wasn’t a normal CSI worker. If she was human, she would see me as her only source of help. If she wasn’t human, she warned me to focus my attention on the other two. This all gave me a bit of a headache trying to think through it. \n\nI let her stand up to get more coffee. The note was hidden in my pocket. As the hours passed, the world outside turned darker. But not completely black due to the snow. I kept trying the phones hoping I could reach someone. \n\n“Shouldn’t your agency be looking for you?” Yates offered as I was trying the phone again. \n\n“No, I’m not that high of a priority. I want to call my roommate though. He must be getting worried.” I answered back knowing no one from The Corporation would be looking for someone like me. \n\n“Roommate...?” Yates asked as if that meant something. \n\n“Just a roommate.” I said back a bit annoyed people kept asking that. \n\nAt least he dropped it. Maggie found a couch to try and sleep on. Wards kept going in and out of his office complaining that we hadn’t been found yet. We all knew not to try and talk him down. He would only get more upset if we made any attempts to explain why a snowplow hadn’t come by yet. \n\n“This is insulting! I’m the Sheriff! And my family were the first to be in the crappy town! We build the damn thing, and this is how we’re repaid? Someone should have been here hours ago! And who could even steal our cars to start with!” He ranted while pacing with red cheeks. \n\n“It’s not as if you have too many friends.” Yates said not caring that he would start another rant. \n\n“When you're a good Sheriff, you make enemies! I get this is all some sort of prank bullshit some kids are playing for their goddamn cellphone videos! If I find out you’re behind this-” \n\nMore of the same came out of his mouth for a full hour. Yates only added some fuel to the fire but never enough to make the older man snap. I wondered what he was up to until Ward finally went back to his office exhausted to sleep on a couch. I figured Ward was the type of man that slept at the office fairly often. \n\nYates wanted to turn in himself. He found a chair big enough to take a nap in but that left me without a place to rest. Maggie already passed out on the couch, and I refused to move her. Yates offered to let me sleep in one of the cells if I held onto the key. I agreed, knowing trying to figure all of this out while tired would be useless. Besides the smell, the cells weren’t the worst place to sleep. \n\nQuestions turned in my head. I couldn’t figure any of this out just yet. I did try to get some rest, but my mind refused to stop working. I glanced over towards the doorway to see Yates with his back towards the cells in a chair. He passed out as if that was an easy thing to do. I stayed on the stiff cell bed with my eyes closed to trick my brain into sleeping.",

        "text": "5 years ago, I was 10 years old and I was visiting my grandparents. I was going to sleep at their place and I used to ask my grandmother to tell me stories before falling asleep. Then she told me that she would tell me the story of the yellow eyes that visit you at night. \n\nBy the next day I had almost completely forgotten the story, I only had a vague recollection of what it was, spirits of people who are not buried, I had forgotten any other details. When I asked my grandmother to tell me the story again, she simply asked me: \n\n\"Which story?\"\n\nI had noticed that she had huge dark circles under her eyes and I knew that she had been quite senile lately. On the same day, she fainted and was taken to the hospital. She died after 3 days. 2 years later, the same thing happened to my grandfather. \n\nMy parents told me they didn't know what it was about when I told them about grandma's story, they hadn't heard of it. \n\nThe house where I spent a good part of my life was on the outskirts of the city, where in the evening you could hear drunkards cursing in the streets. It was a place where you saw many strange things and also many things happened. The house had two floors, the ground floor where my and my parents' room was, and the attic.\n\n I was used to sleeping through the noise, constantly being all kinds of ambient sounds from the wheels of the trains screeching on their own to the screams of people who no longer knew about themselves from drinking. \n\nOne night while I was sitting in bed on the phone I heard something knocking on the window. I looked but I didn't see anything and I returned to what I was doing. The next two nights the same thing happened, and then I decided to change my position in bed to face the window. \n\nI heard a knock and suddenly looked up. I saw some bright yellow eyes on a black figure, that figure had no face and no legs, it was levitating.\n\n It started to open the window, it was a window that could be opened very easily, you just lifted it. It entered my room and I wanted to run and scream but I was paralyzed. \n\nMy grandmother had told me stories about such spirits that belong to people whose bodies were not put in a coffin, but I thought they were just stories, nothing else, so of course I forgot them over time. She told me that they don't hurt you, but once you see them you won't be the same and they will visit you every night, at first once a night, but with time they come more and more often, until you can no longer sleep at all and end up going crazy.\n\nNow it's night, so far I've been visited 6 times and it's 00:30, two months have passed since the first visit and the maximum number of visitors was 7. \n\nDuring these 2 months my parents ended up in the hospital, having mental problems. I came to the conclusion that they were also visited, but more often than me, I had noticed that they had dark circles, but I didn't think much of it. \n\nMy grandparents haven't been with us for a few years so I can ask them for advice, but I don't think they're the only ones who know about it, in a neighborhood with so many drunks, surely someone must have seen them, but I have to hurry to find them, I'm getting less and less sleep and I feel like I'm going crazy.\n\n4 days have passed since the last entry in the diary of the latest events. In the meantime, in the evening I would walk the streets, seeing the silhouettes following me, and I would ask any drunkard I saw if he knew a story about spirits of people who were not buried. The first 2 evenings I had no success and I reached a total of 17 visits per night, I only slept during the day when I was not visited.\n \nOn the 3rd evening I reached the edge of the neighborhood, I had started to lose hope in finding a solution, when I met an old man who was sitting on a bench playing chess, he was face to face with a spirit, I understood then that he could see the ones behind me. \n\nI went to him without saying anything, I didn't know what to do, I just looked into his eyes. \"Take a sit.\", he urged me, so I sat next to the spirit face to face with the old man. He understood from my looks what I wanted and started to tell me. \n\n\"These spirits or silhouettes, whatever you want to call them, they don't care what you call them, they belong to people whose bodies have not been buried, but I assume you already know that. They only show themselves to those who meet certain criteria:\n\n1. You were at a funeral\n \n2. You can help them. The first part is pretty easy to understand, the second is a bit more complicated. You may have already thought about the fact that you can get rid of them if you find the body and bury it, but it's too much work for a human, especially a child. \n\nAnd the rest of your family has been visited, I guess you have bad luck in your blood, but they won't stop until they find someone.\n\n You can only save your parents if you accept the job of the gravedigger. By this all the spirits will come to you and in turn take you to the body that belonged to them, there can only be 14 gravediggers, currently there are 12, the spirits choose 14 families to haunt until someone takes this job. I had this conversation with the rest of your family, even your great-grandparents, but they refused. Now it's your turn, but before you decide you need to know what it consists of.\" \n\n\"You will work incessantly without sleep, water or food, you will no longer be able to interact with other people and they will not be able to see you. It will always be night for you, you will never again see the sun and any light source except the moon and the yellow eyes of the figures. Each individual figure will come in front of you, the others will wait their turn behind you  and guide you to their body, each gravedigger has a fairly large search area, but they won't take you on other continents after bodies. \n\nOnce it is found you will carry the body on a sled after you to the nearest cemetery, you will know where it is and you will bury it in the ground. This is what you will do for the rest of your normal life. You would have 64 more years to live, if you accept this you will do it in those 64 years. \n\nYou have 4 days to decide, you will not be visited in them, but if you refuse, more will come than before, a lot more\". \n\nJust as he finished the story to be told, the chess game was over, the old man had lost. It was day. At the moment I have 3 days to think. I know that if I refuse, my parents will die and before long probably so will I and another family will be chosen. \n\nThe time has come for me to decide, I don't know what to choose, it seems like torture to live your life like this, but people rely on survival instinct, they would do whatever it takes, but can this be considered living? I don't know how I make my decision whether the old man will come to me or I just say yes or no, but one thing is clear, the diary ends here, if I say yes I will no longer be able to interact with the living world for anyone to see what I write in diary and if I say no, I won't spend my last days writing, especially since I already feel that I can't stand life anymore.",

        "text": " \n\nDrops of rain spattered on my face. I felt a deep pit in my stomach. A pit I had been filling up with endless whiskey for the last month and a half. What stood before me was the edge of a cliff I was about to plunge into. I didn’t care to live. The bottom of my third bottle today was giving me the extra courage I needed to not think about what it. Soon it would be all over and I wouldn’t have to live with this misery anymore. I would finally find sweet release.\n\nAbout to take a step forward, a soft voice came from behind. “Are you going to kill yourself?”\n\nI turned around, confused that someone was out here in the storming rain. I mean, I was, but I had a reason.\n\nBehind me was a little girl. She stood under five feet, her hair silver-colored and long, stretching all the way down her back. Her skin was pale, her body frail and she had this uncanny valley feeling. But what put me off was her eyes. The pupils were a milky glaze but the iris was a bright golden color. It was actually beautiful in a horrific way.\n\n“Get out of here brat,” I waved my hand, wanting this to be a lonely moment for me and not to give a child some trauma.\n\n“But you’re going to jump off that cliff, aren’t you?”\n\nI swallowed; a burning sensation at this point due to all of the alcohol I had been drinking today. “Yeah…”\n\n“Why?”\n\nMy head looked down, I felt shame for what I was about to do. Even though my drunken state was supposed to remove all anxiety, the fact a child was here watching me made me feel even more pitiful.\n\n“Just— it’s been a bad time,” my voice broke.\n\n“Is it because your wife killed herself? Or maybe it was because your son was kidnapped and murdered?” she spoke with a sudden coldness.\n\nMy eyes lifted, sudden, seething hatred coursed through my veins as I looked at her. How did she know about all that?\n\nI marched towards her, my anger blinding me because I didn’t need to hear any of this right now.\n\n“I wouldn’t let my hatred get the best of me right now if I were you.” she spoke with authority.\n\n“SHUT UP!” I snapped.\n\nShe didn’t say anything, her lips tightly sealed. I kept looking at her, my hatred still boiling but when I thought about it a little more, I was able to take a few deep breaths and cool my head.\n\n“No, I shouldn’t have said that to you. But how do you know about my situation?”\n\nShe walked towards me, no fear in any of her movements and I thought she was blind but it seemed like she knew exactly where I was. She looked up at me with a dead stare. “I've come to help. Do you know anything about the Redeemer’s Forest?”\n\n“N— No…”\n\nI can take you there. And if you can get through the journey, all of the pain you’ve felt will be healed.”\n\nI looked at the child. Her face looked sincere enough and I thought about what she had said. No, this didn’t make any sense. How would a child know about any of this stuff? But did it matter? I humored her.\n\n“What do I have to do, little girl,” I said with a hint of condescension, but she didn’t seem to take offense to my skepticism.\n\n“Go home. Drink a glass of water. Get in bed at exactly midnight.”\n\nThe rain was still splashing on my whole body, leaving me drenched and cold. Maybe this was all a strange hallucination I was going through. But, what did I have to lose? I already lost everything as it is. What’s one more night? There’s always tomorrow.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat night, I did exactly what she said. And right when it was turning twelve, I quickly got into bed and covered myself with the blanket. I thought this was all stupid and that I should be dead in a ditch right now.\n\nI watched the clock from across the room as it abruptly turned to 12:01.\n\n“Well, this was pointless—” without warning, the room suddenly faded and I was thrown into pitch blackness and I felt my body freezing up. I couldn’t move and I thought I was struck with some sort of paralysis. My body was constricting and I felt as if I was being crushed under some unusual weight hiding in the dark. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t say a thing. I wanted to scream at that moment but all I could muster was a slight huff of air. Fear took hold of me until I fell unconscious.\n\nThen, I was walking. I don’t remember when I even started. But I was approaching an exit. A light at the end. A crimson light. And extreme heat.\n\nSurprisingly, I still felt like I was me. Like I was alive and fully aware. Nothing like a dream. This was a real place I was walking into.\n\nEmerging from the cave, I saw I had entered somewhere unbelievably distressing.\n\nWhat I had exited was a few outlandishly tall mountains, steep, about a 90° angle. But what lay in front of me was massive stretches of rolling, blackened dirt fields with dead, twisted trees. Plant life so deformed and mangled, covered in dozens of mouths screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nI wanted to go back into the cave, but when I turned around, it was nothing more than solid rock. The rocks were covered in ants that had these alien-like features. They had antennae shaped like slug eye stocks, but also three real eyes on their heads, and walked around on miniature human fingers. They also made a loud noise that resembled laughing children.\n\nI quickly moved away from them. But I also didn’t want to get closer to the trees. I was at a loss of what to do but was forced to relent and choose the least terrible option. Trees it was.\n\nWalking into the dead forest, I looked up at the sky for the first time. I don’t know why I didn’t do this before, but I did now. I guess my mind was still trying to process everything on the surface. Dark clouds were already in the process of breaking up. But a few of them seemed to resemble skulls. Human skulls that rolled on top of each other as the clouds broke apart. Above them, they revealed gigantic eyeballs with massive tendrils stretched out over the horizon.\n\n“Sick…” I muttered, still not entirely sure if I’m having an insanely vivid dream or a bad acid trip. But I don’t take drugs. And I felt truly here.\n\nThe air was crispy. Almost like it was trying to fry my skin off. I was terrified I would cook out here even though it didn’t feel like it should be hot. Yet my body was reacting to it in such a way.\n\n“Hello,” I mumbled, a little scared of what might be attracted to my voice if I called out too hard. But at the same time, I wished there was someone else here.\n\n“Hello, is anyone there?”\n\nTaking a few steps forward, I heard a familiar voice from behind a tree in front of me. The little girl stepped out, only this time she had a slight smile on her face. The face looked too mischievous for my liking.\n\n“You did it.”\n\n“Yeah…” I hesitated, “but where exactly am I?”\n\n“I told you, this is the Redeemer’s Forest. I saw you about to make a stupid decision and saw to it that I take advantage of the situation.”\n\n“What? You’re saying you tricked me!?” I stomped my feet forward, the anger in my tone of voice rising.\n\n“I’m sorry. But most people don’t consent to being mentally sent to a reality as nightmarish and atrocious as this place.”\n\nI was about to grab hold of her, angered by her words, but she stepped behind the tree and walked out from behind another one a dozen feet away from me.\n\n“Stop letting your anger get the best of you. It’s not going to serve you well here.”\n\nI was gritting my teeth. I didn’t enjoy getting tricked. I’ve been through so much of that already and having someone else play with my mind was only causing further aggravation.\n\n“Stupid kid,” I scoffed at her, walking away from this conversation.\n\n“You’ll thank me later.” her voice blew across the landscape, but I was already too heated to want anything more to do with her.\n\nAfter walking around to cool off, it dawned on me that I had made a huge mistake. I had no idea where I was, and now I had no idea how to get out of it.\n\n“Geez, I honestly can’t deal with this today. I knew I should’ve jumped that cliff.”\n\nWhen I finally found the level-hededness, I needed to start thinking clearly, the silence was broken by the sound of something trudging through the dirt. It sounded gruff, animalistic, and had a sloppy, fleshy smacking of lips.\n\nTerrified, I hid behind a nearby tree, although they were all moaning and drawing attention to themselves, I didn’t think it would affect my chances of remaining unseen. I tried to steady my breath, but my heart was beating at a rapid pace. I couldn’t slow it because my fear of being hunted was already kicking in. Still, I wanted to get a look at what it was.\n\nI peeked around the edges of the tree, my eyes widening when I saw what was making the noise.\n\nStanding at 15 feet, a gargantuanly fat, cow-headed, humanoid was tearing through the dirt, its massive hoof-like feet leaving behind ditches. It was covered in dirty, mangled hair as dark as obsidian. Its horns looked to be made of the same material. It carried a long spear and didn’t seem to be aware of my presence yet.\n\nStill, I knew better than to step out and reveal myself. It snorted, letting out a cow-like call. I felt my lungs seizing up with fear as I was trying to pin myself as close to the tree trunk as I possibly could.\n\nA loud thumping slowly got closer to me. I couldn’t control my breathing, I wanted to start running but I wasn’t too sure if I could out-race it.\n\nA scream erupted. A woman screaming.\n\nI peered out and saw the cowman had grabbed someone else. I wasn’t alone here. He had taken hold of some blonde woman, her body already looking like it had been mangled by previous injuries, and the cow was pulling on one of her arms, crushing it inside his gigantic grasp. She screamed fits of terror, causing me to break out in a sweat as I listened to her desperate pleas for mercy disappear.\n\n“Oh God! Oh God! There’s no way that was real!” I choked up.\n\nI was holding onto my heart, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts about whatever that was.\n\n“It was real.”\n\nMy heart nearly jumped out of my mouth when I heard those words. But I barely regained control of my composure and looked around. I didn’t think there was anyone else here but a redheaded woman stepped out from behind a tree.\n\nI let out a fit-full scream, fear crawling across my brain as I took a glance at the woman in front of me. She wore a tattered, dark green robe, torn to-ribbons jeans, and a white T-shirt with over a dozen small holes, but that wasn’t the reason for my panic attack. It was because, sticking out of her skin, all of her veins and arteries hung from her body. They were extended out so far that a lot of them were dragging on the ground behind her, but thankfully they did not appear to come out from her face and hands.\n\n“Dear God, what happened to you,” I fell to the ground and started crawling backward as she approached. Her eyes gave a dead expression as she stared at me.\n\n“I— unfortunately— had a bad experience here a few years ago and haven’t been able to remove them successfully. But if you’re done crying about my appearance, we better find shelter soon. The storm clouds are about to show up.”\n\nShe pointed up at the sky and I saw it again. Thick, brownish cloud formations were gathering. Slowly they were starting to morph into the shape of skulls and hands with pointed fingers. Looking a little further toward the west, I saw one of the storm clouds had already formed. Gigantic hands were reaching down toward the ground, picking up something too small for me to see.\n\nThe lady was already running, and I quickly got back to my feet, realizing she was no danger to me. I chased after her, desperately not wanting to get caught out in whatever storms these clouds would bring.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe ran for a few minutes until she led me to a foxhole in the ground. I was a little hesitant to follow, but she went in headfirst, crawling all the way in. Storms were gathering and I saw long, twisted stretches of tornadoes approaching, alongside pillars of blazing flames dancing across the surface of this world.\n\n“Get in,” her voice echoed from the tunnel.\n\nNot wanting to get caught out here, I went in and crawled into the darkness, but thankfully there was a small lantern at the other end.\n\nShe was crouched with her legs pulled up to her chest. She watched as I tried to get myself situated and said, “So, what brings you around here?”\n\n“Oh you know, I wanted to see the sights,” I sarcastically remarked.\n\n“Very funny. But what is your reason for coming to this reality?”\n\n“I was tricked into making a deal with some little girl.”\n\nThe lantern flickered and there was a loud boom that echoed from above. I could hear the wind outside picking up and blowing at tremendous speeds that probably would’ve shredded the skin right off of my body.\n\n“I know what girl you’re talking about. She made the same deal with me years ago.”\n\n“Years?”\n\n“Yes,” her voice carried a jolting heaviness.\n\n“What is this place?”\n\nShe thought about it for a moment and explained, “I asked many people who are also trying to survive here. This place, this land… many believe it to be another reality. Something beyond our physical realm that we inhabit. A place only the mind can enter.”\n\n“Heh, seriously?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Then, what was that bull-headed man?”\n\nThat was a Hunter. Not yours though. This world manifests a monster that aims to find and torture you. And their methods are worse than you can possibly imagine. That bull monster probably belonged to the woman it found and carried off.”\n\n“So I have one?”\n\n“Yes. Everyone gets one. And most of the time they only go after the person they are specifically hunting. But sometimes if you find yourself in their way, you’ll be briefly attacked before they get bored and continue their hunt for the main target.”\n\n“But wouldn’t that mean you have one too?”\n\n“Why do you think all of my veins are dangling out from my body?” she stared daggers at me.\n\nI looked down shamefully. “Sorry…”\n\nShe took a few deep breaths and laid back against the dirt wall. We waited for a good while as the storm passed overhead. I kept thinking about why I was sent here. It didn’t make any sense.\n\n“So what reason do you have for being here?” her question rang out.\n\nI scratched my head and thought about it. With nothing else to do and maybe getting a little off of my chest, it might help to tell someone.\n\n“Well, besides the fact I was tricked into coming here, I was married. I had a son. My wife and I didn’t seem to talk too much and I hardly spent enough time with them…”\n\nEmotions were starting to well up again. Talking about this was becoming more difficult with each word that passed through my lips.\n\n“And?” her eyes had an intense focus on me.\n\n“And one day, he was kidnapped.” I swallowed, a lump growing in my throat with tears trying to force their way out, “We tried our best to cooperate with law enforcement to find him but a few days later he was found. In the ditch. And after what the autopsy told us about what he likely went through, it broke both of us. No child should ever have to go through such god-awful, traumatic torment right before being… being…”\n\nThe words escaped me. I didn’t feel like I could go any further with what I had to say. My heart was aching too much and I felt intense pain coursing through my chest. My eyes were starting to break and I sniffled a little louder than I expected.\n\n“I’m sorry that happened. But this place is typically reserved for those who did something wrong. Why are you here?”\n\nI said, “I don’t know. Maybe because after it happened, I threw myself into my work even more so. She always complained about me working too much before it happened. Everyone kept saying it was my fault when she broke and took her life. She didn’t want to deal with the memories of what we had gone through. And it left me by myself. Everyone blamed me, everyone always blamed me. Her dad said it was my fault she did it. That I should’ve been there for her but no one ever thought about what I needed!” my anger exploded momentarily which surprised the woman.\n\nFinally, I let the tears escape and wept bitterly. It was all too much to keep it all in and I didn’t want to deal with this pain anymore.\n\n\"And once she was gone, I lost all meaning to go on by myself; prepared to jump off a cliff and get it over with. I had nothing. And that's when that little girl talked to me.\"\n\nThe red-headed woman's eyes never broke. It dawned on me I never asked for her name.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I should have remembered this back when we first met. What's your name?\"\n\nShe scratched the side of her arm, keeping herself closed off even more so. I thought I had done something wrong but she said, \"Angie. Don't worry, I only hesitated because it's been so long...\"\n\n\"So long?\" I questioned.\n\n\"So long since I last said it. I've been here for so many years that I don't even know the exact time. A few decades maybe?\"\n\n\"Why are you here?\" I asked.\n\nShe looked up at me, her eyes red with tears. Her face dropped to her knees and she sobbed hard. I sat there quietly until she finished. I felt so helpless because she was hurting, I was hurting. Neither of us knew the right words to say to each other. Maybe there wasn’t a word that could be said to make the pain vanish.\n\nShe broke the silence. \"I'm sad to say I don’t remember all that well. A lot of the other people I've met here say the same thing. You must be incredibly new to still remember your reason.\"\n\nI sat there in my silence, watching as she had an explosive outburst of emotion.\n\n\"It's not fair!” she shouted before lowering, “I remember there being a little boy. Did I have a son? A nephew maybe? It feels like I'm responsible for his death. I don't remember it though. It feels like the memories have died within me.\"\n\nThe wind outside slowly faded from existence. We were now left with a much more peaceful quiet time to recover ourselves and put on our brave faces. She calmed down last, I being the fastest one to steady my feelings, and she felt like it was the best time to exit the hole. She climbed out first and I followed after and we were both outside, surrounded by dying flames and scorched trees. The mouths were screaming in agony, and this brought even more discomfort to me.\n\n\"Is there any way we can get out of here?\"\n\n\"All I've ever heard of is that we're supposed to find a bush. If we find the bush, we can go back home. Something about our sins being forgiven or something.\" she shook her head dismissively at the notion.\n\n\"Well, where do you suppose it is?\"\n\n\"You think any of us would be here if we knew where it was?\"\n\nNow I understood. It was a hidden treasure we had to seek out. And seek it out I did. She had grown complacent and had given up any hope, but I was not going to since I was new and still had that fire burning within me to get out. But we’d always retreat back to the foxhole whenever another one of those horrendous storms reared its ugly head, or when a monster would come along, looking for its prey.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI could only guess a few weeks have passed. Despite feeling hunger and thirst constantly, we did not succumb to these demands of our bodies. I guessed that we didn’t need to eat or drink, although it would’ve eased the suffering. But I was only able to avoid the other problem for so long. Avoid the monsters that roamed about. That changed when I had my first encounter with mine.\n\nI was sitting in front of a tree, listening to its whispers. It wasn't screaming like the others, and I was a little curious to hear what it had to say.\n\n\"No sight. No sight. Walk. Walk. Walk.\" and repeat. What could it mean though?\n\nBut a clicking, hissing sound echoed behind me. I was immediately thrown up from my feet, grabbed forcibly by something with sharpened claws, and tossed towards another patch of trees violently.\n\nI hit my head on the trunk, and the tree began to scream excitedly, believing I was assaulting it.\n\nLooking on the other side, I saw a hunched-over, feminine monstrosity. Her eyes were like a hornet’s, her mouth atrociously stretched open to reveal teeth like an angler fish, her arms were absurdly long, practically dragging across the ground and the claws on those fingers were well over 10 inches. Her skin was a sickly green tint, covered in spider veins, and on her back were shards of her ribs poking out. In essence, pure nightmare fuel.\n\nI quickly got to my feet and ran as fast as I could. There was no way I was going to let something as heinous as that get its blood-soaked claws on me. But I didn't have a choice in the matter when I felt it jump onto my back, pinned me to the ground, and started slicing into me.\n\nI screamed out in tormented agony, words escaping me as the air was sucked out of my lungs. The creature kept making that clicking, hissing sound the whole time, and at some point, everything started to turn red. I realized blood was covering my eyes and I thought I was going to die.\n\nSuddenly she stopped, got off my back, and dragged me by my feet, scratching the front of my body up against rocks, dirt, and charred wood.\n\nI tried to get the strength to resist, but I couldn't fight back anymore. My strength was gone because hunger and thirst had left me somewhat paralyzed. I kept crying out for Angie, but I never saw her. Where could she be? I thought I was being loud enough. But she never came.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe following events were some of the most unpleasant. I would spend an uncertain amount of weeks being tortured. She had left me in a cave, somehow having chains ready for me and keeping me in place. She would occasionally go out, giving me a moment of peace before she would come back with a clay bowl filled with acid.\n\nBut before she did what she did, she took this strange, fleshy substance and put it over my eyes. I was effectively blindfolded.\n\nShe'd dump the bowl on my head, and I felt all my hair and skin melting off. This was unbearable agony that nobody should ever experience. It felt like I was being specifically targeted for no good reason. Just like how everyone always targeted me back on Earth. They blamed me for things that were out of my control.\n\nOnce she was done melting the skin off, she took her long claws and effectively gutted me. How I was still alive, I had no idea.\n\nShe mangled my body until it was nothing more than a broken tangle of flesh and bones. Still, she never took off the fleshy flaps from my eyes. I kept wondering why my eyes were being protected? I tried asking her, but she stuck one of her long claws right down my mouth, popping out the back of my head.\n\nAfter enduring this for so long, I had grown used to the torture. My body was sapped of blood and water, and my nerves had already been fried to the point where I couldn't feel anything anymore. I could still hear, smell, taste and I guess see if it wasn't for the flaps, but all sensations of the skin, as well as internal organs, were basically dead.\n\nOn one particular day, my hunter left, likely to get more acid, and I heard someone's voice call out to me.\n\n\"Psst, hey, are you there?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" my hoarse voice called back.\n\nI heard the sound of footsteps approaching, and a loud gasp. \"Oh God, what has that thing done to you!?\"\n\nWhatever was done to me, it had to be bad.\n\n\"Don't worry. I think you can still move.\" she reassured me.\n\nI felt her hands around my cheekbones, and she peeled off the flap from my eyes. The damage my body had sustained was more than extensive. My skin was nearly gone, muscles exposed and rotted, and a few internal organs were visible.\n\n\"You're not going to like this, but you can't die here.\"\n\nI smiled, even though I knew most of my teeth were gone. \"Yeah, I kind of figured that one out on my own.\"\n\nShe found the key nearby and got me out of the chains. She explained to me that she had been looking for me the entire time. She wasn't sure where I had been dragged off, but when she was able to find another wanderer passing by, he mentioned about me in the cave.\n\nThe whole time I wanted to fall asleep, but I had to hold out until we got back to the foxhole. She said everything would be better once we got there. I remember little of the journey, only remembering she stuffed me down the hole first, but I was a mangled mess of flesh and bone. She crawled in and rested on the other side. Her face was screaming exhaustion and both of us finally rested.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke up, not from any rested feeling, but only because I felt an immense amount of pain return. It was the type of burning sensation you get when you touch glowing hot iron. My exposed muscles had gotten dirt in them and the stinging was so bad, I barely could get up. Nerves returning?\n\n\"JESUS! GOD WHY DID YOU LET THIS HAPPEN!?\" I shouted.\n\nThis stirred Angie, and she saw I was having the worst of wake-ups.\n\nShe calmly replied to my rhetorical question, \"Maybe we deserved this?\"\n\n\"Why!?\" I shouted, taking another look at my body and noticing that it was healing. Even though my hands had most of the flesh melted off, all the way to the bone, it was scabbing back up and some of the meat had been growing back over the fingers.\n\n\"We did bad things,\" she sighed, \"now we live in this place.\"\n\n\"I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!”\n\nShe lifted an eyebrow. “Are you sure?”\n\n“YES, I JUST—\"\n\nI stopped. Tears welling up. I realized what I had done wrong.\n\n\"I wasn't a good husband or father...\" I mumbled, disturbed by my own words.\n\nAngie watched as I realized what I had done wrong. I wasn't there for those who needed me. I was neglectful. I didn't pay enough attention to my son, thus losing him. I didn't comfort my wife or even try to be there for her in any capacity. I simply went to work and tried not to think about it. I abandoned those who needed me. Was this why the girl chose me?\n\nI felt a looming presence nearby and both my and Angie's eyes drifted toward the exit. It was the little girl. Her appearance was different. She didn't look so sickly and uncanny as before. Now she appeared with long, blonde hair, a healthier body weight, and skin as perfectly clear with no blemishes or imperfections of the sort. Her eyes still had that glow, but it had dimmed a little.\n\nBoth of us jumped back, but it was more painful for me to do so. She had a slight smile growing on her face, and said, \"Good, you're making progress. You're getting close to escaping now. But you're going to have to have a little faith and believe things will work out. This is my final message to you. I didn't do this to torment you. Your torture is of your own creation. It's up to you to make the final choice. Now find the bush.\"\n\nWith those words, she turned back and climbed up the hole, sparking curiosity in me to follow suit. Angie followed too and we watched as she hopped on the back of a creature that possessed the body of a deer, but its head was an owl possessing four faces on each side. Each of the owl's eyes was a different color and the neck would spin to change faces. Its tail was also long and covered in hair like a horse, and it had absurdly long goat horns piercing out from atop its head. The fur was a mesmerizing malachite color.\n\nThe creature shook its head briefly and frolicked away, disappearing into the smoke and fire with that strange girl.\n\nAngie and I returned back to the foxhole and contemplated what our next move was going to be?\n\nI thought long and hard about what she was talking about. What could someone like me do? I had come to the conclusion that I should have done more for my wife and son. God only knows I would try to make everything right if I could, but maybe that's not the point. I've accepted that I've made some bad decisions. I have to live with them now.\n\nAngie was sitting across from me, staring at the fire inside the lantern. Then she propped her head up. \"I know what I did.\"\n\nTears fell as dew drops on glass until she stared back at me.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I killed my nephew.” those words hung for a moment, “I remember now. Or rather, I had been suppressing these memories for so long that I genuinely believed I did nothing to deserve any of this. But I do. I deserve it all...\"\n\nI got up so I could sit closer to her and she held on to my arm. The feeling of the veins still dangling on her skin was an uncomfortable feeling when they rubbed up against my partially healed skin.\n\n\"I was young. I wanted to be a great aunt. I brought him with me to a party. I thought everything was okay and that I was invincible. I drank a lot, even did a few drugs. When the party was over, I was a little too confident I could still drive. I...\" she paused, her face melting into a much more broken person than before. Again, she almost looked like she was losing her will to breathe.\n\nI reached my hand and covered over hers, \"It's okay. I'm not one to judge.\"\n\n\"We crashed,\" she said.\n\n\"I thought so.\"\n\nShe covered her face a little, her weeping filling the cramped space.\n\n\"My sister was so heartbroken about what I did. I tried apologizing, but she said that she'd never forgive me. I got defensive. I don't know what came over me at the time, but I thought that it was her fault. I even came up with the stupid rationalization that she should have been smarter to not trust him with me. I got into a bad habit of never taking the blame.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" I said.\n\nWe sat there in silence. The flames of the lantern were the only warmth to fill the icy coldness we felt. I was hollow now. I felt as if there was nothing more than complete self-loathing living within me. We both kept crying until sleep finally was kind enough to take us out of it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI came outside some hours later, still looking at all the screaming trees, the skull clouds, and the sharpened rocky mountain ranges surrounding this strange reality we had found ourselves trapped in. But there was one tree I always happened to notice whenever we were in a different section of the land. Every now and then, there'd be a tree that only whispered. One near us. I kept looking at it.\n\nIt would repeat, \"No sight. No sight. Walk. Walk. Walk.\"\n\nAngie came climbing up out of the hole and saw what I was doing. \"Something caught your eye?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Why is it that most trees scream but there's always a strange individual among them that whispers those words?\"\n\nShe saw what I meant and replied, \"I couldn't tell you.\"\n\n\"No sight. No sight. Walk. Walk. Walk.\" I repeated the phrase.\n\n\"It probably doesn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"Why did my hunter make sure my eyes stayed intact? Unless...\"\n\nI took a few steps forward, swallowed despite the dry mouth, and told Angie, \"Walk with me.\"\n\nShe did. We walked, passing by all the trees. Hearing the chaotic roaring of hunters nearby. The cries of people who were being caught by them. And yet I was certain this was the only way to get out.\n\n\"Angie, I need you to trust me. Keep walking, but keep your eyes closed.\"\n\n\"What? That's dangerous. It'll be more difficult to find the foxhole.\"\n\nI didn't stop moving, but I said, \"Faith Angie. We have to have it to escape from here. That's what the girl made it sound like.\"\n\nShe looked reluctant but when I met her eyes, she nodded.\n\nStill walking, I closed my eyes. I had to keep breathing, maintaining a calm heart. And that was difficult when you were worried about crashing into a tree. But surprisingly, I never crashed into a tree once. The moment my eyes were shut, it felt as if I was walking not on rugged, battered land, but on the smoothest possible land. Like marble, solid and stable.\n\nI kept pace and started to hear something. The crackle of a fire. And I felt the warmth of it.\n\nWhen it was starting to become unbearable, I stopped and immediately felt Angie bump against me from behind.\n\nThe heat was so intense, it actually hurt my eyes. I took a few steps back and saw we had approached something amazing.\n\nIt was a large patch of bushes. But they were all on fire. Engulfed completely, yet physically unharmed. Burning bushes. A spectacular view.\n\n\"Is this the bush she was talking about?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine there being another one. She certainly left out the part where it was on fire.\"\n\n\"What now?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know?\"\n\nI breathed, the burning heat passing into my lungs. It was far too hot for one to comfortably stand near.\n\nI walked around the bushes, wondering if there was something behind it. But there was nothing. And when I got back over to Angie, we heard the shrieking of something chilling. My hunter had found me.\n\nWe looked towards the direction where it came from. Behind us was my hunter and hers. It looked like a knight, its armor was spiked and covered in crimson and black material. And its face was morphed to resemble a tiger helmet, and from within the mouth, hooks were reaching out.\n\nWe were trapped. I looked at them and back at the burning bushes, Panic setting in until I saw it. A path going right through the large patch. Just enough for a single person to fit in.\n\n\"We have to go through,\" I grabbed her arm, moving closer.\n\nBut she pulled back, saying, \"We'll die.\"\n\n\"We can't die here.\"\n\n\"It'll hurt.\"\n\nI turned to the flames, then back to her. \"It will. But sometimes you have to suffer in order for things to get better.\"\n\nOur hunters were getting closer and I took one deep breath. I had to believe there was a way out. Although I was not religious, I found myself praying.\n\nBracing myself, I took the first step and felt the stinging burns of embers beneath my feet. It was instinctual to jump back, but I had to take the next step. I moved forward, my raggedy clothes catching and the flames rapidly crawled up, dancing all over my body.\n\n\"GOD! OH GOD!\" I cried.\n\nFlames cooked my flesh, blackening it and leaving it crusty. It took every ounce of adrenaline coursing through me to keep going through but running proved too much. I was forced to walk at the fastest speed possible as the flames made my body rapidly deteriorate. My eyes started to melt, and my bladder released, only for it to boil on my exposed muscles. I couldn't take it anymore and I wondered if Angie was even following behind me.\n\n*\"Little more,\"* I thought.\n\nMy eyesight was gone but I knew to keep going straight. The fire was burning me up faster and I struggled to keep my feet forward, thoughts of turning back screaming at me. I stopped breathing, it was too much. I stubbornly kept my mindset despite that inferno destroying my existence until finally, I felt a release overtake me after I threw myself forward with one large step.\n\nThere was nothing for a moment. Emptiness. Bodylessness. The obliteration of one's physical existence. And yet, still alive.\n\nSuddenly, I found myself covered in ice, throwing myself forward and realizing I was covered in a cold sweat. My lungs were heaving hard and I looked around to see I was in my room. My mind was going at a million miles per hour and I realized what had happened.\n\nI was home again. I made it. I made it through the burning bushes.\n\nThe emotions I was feeling were beyond overwhelming. I was about to go into hysterical crying until I felt the tugging of the sheets. I looked to my left and I saw... I saw her. It was my wife again, she was alive.\n\n\"Kaylee,\" the words rolled out from my mouth as I caressed her cheek with my fingers. To have that touch again was the greatest feeling ever.\n\nShe stirred awake, only to see her husband in the middle of an emotional breakdown.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" she said, concerned.\n\nNo longer able to hold back, I quickly wrapped my arms around her, hugging her more tightly than ever. Thankfully, she returned my hug. That touch was something I could not treasure enough. I never want to release her and I cried. Cried so hard as she pulled me closer. Together again.\n\nI finally answered her question, \"Just a really bad nightmare.\"\n\nI had her back. And I had my son too. I had returned three days before his kidnapping, and I made sure it could never happen this time around. We avoided it and I made sure to have every opportunity I could to spend time with them. I never wanted to leave them alone and I worked hard at trying to find a job that would allow me to work at home. It was less money, but I think my wife understood I wanted to be with them more. And she did too.\n\nI don't deserve this. I don't deserve them. But I'll never stop cherishing the time I get to spend with them. And I hope Angie was as fortunate as I was. All I can say is you should always try to appreciate the good things you got. Because not everyone gets a second chance. It's better to be happy with your blessings. It's better than having to walk through the flames.",

        "text": "It started off small. Like, really small. \n\n\nI was searching for a pair of earrings. I keep them in a little glass bowl by my bed, and every time I take a pair of earrings off I put the back on so I don't lose it. But I found an extra earring back, a little twist of curved silver, just drifting about in the sea of earrings all by itself. I couldn't find a single earring that didn't have its back. \n\n\nI didn't think much of it beyond a vague confusion. But I kept it just in case. \n\n\nBut then one day I opened my kitchen drawer to get a fork and picked up a fork I didn't recognise. \n\n\nI live alone. People rarely come round. The fork had a different pattern on its handle than the forks I'd purchased. \n\n\nThat made me more uneasy than the earring thing. How could someone smuggle a fork into my drawer? \n\n\nI never used the fork. It was a weird shape. I didn't like how it felt in my hand. \n\n\nNext I found a pen in the pot on my desk. I favour the type with the retractable nib, as I'm prone to losing lids, but this pen had a lid. It was one that unscrewed, which I thought was fairly novel, so I kept it. I didn't use the pen though. It was of a kind of metal that felt uncomfortable against my hand, and the nib was blunt.\n\n\nYou may wonder why I didn't question the appearance of these things in my home, but when they are so small and so normal one tends to brush it off. Sometimes I forget things, as everyone does. Maybe I'd brought them home myself. \n\n\nThe umbrella was a different matter. \n\n\nI have an umbrella stand by my door and it has always held exactly two umbrellas at any time. It took me a few days to notice the intruder, as the days had been dry and I hadn't needed an umbrella, but when it rained I discovered 3 umbrellas in my stand. The newcomer was a mottled grey, with a curved leather handle. Quite a smart umbrella, honestly, but the handle didn't fit right in my palm. The leather felt slimy and… Alive. More like skin than cured skin. \n\n\nI took the umbrella outside and put it with the trash. I didn't like the way the handle seemed to have a pulse. \n\n\nA coat appeared next. Some kind of hooded garment with a fur trim, hanging on my coat rack. The fur trim was soft, but it shed when I touched it. Little strands of hair sticking to me that itched. \n\n\nIt was my size, and very warm, but I donated it the next day. The noises it made during the night made it difficult to sleep. \n\n\nIt's tiring to find strange things in one's home. The armchair that appeared yesterday doesn't get in the way, and it matches my decor perfectly, but it sighs when I sit in it. It almost sounds sexual. I don't like that. \n\n\nI will probably stop writing soon. The keys on my keyboard have started to push back when I press them. And the framed picture on the wall that has been above my bed for the past few days has been stretching in a way that is very distracting. \n\n\nI thought all this might be in my head, but I called my mother while I was at work today and told her about what had been happening. She came round to my house, using the key I'd given her. She didn't stay long. She sent me a message right after, telling me not to go home, but to come to her house straight after work. She was vehement about it, kept gabbling about the hallway rug having fingers, or something, but she's always been prone to dramatics. Still, I will go to her house once I've picked up a few essential items. I think I could use the break. \n\n\nI need to get my suitcase from the hall closet, but I will admit I'm nervous. I know I didn't leave the door open. And I don't like the way the closet is breathing. ",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember the day I discovered the old, leather-bound book in the attic. I was eleven years old, with a wild imagination and a fascination for all things mysterious. It was a warm summer day, and my parents had gone out for the afternoon, leaving me home alone to entertain myself.\n\nI had always been curious about the attic, and so I decided to explore it. I climbed the rickety ladder, brushed off the cobwebs, and started rummaging through the boxes of old clothes and toys. That's when I saw it: a dusty old book lying on a shelf in the corner.\n\nAs I picked it up, I noticed the cover was adorned with strange symbols and characters. I flipped through the pages, fascinated by the stories and illustrations within. There were tales of ancient civilizations, mythical creatures, and mystical powers.\n\nThe more I read, the more I became obsessed with the book. I started spending all my free time in the attic, reading and rereading the stories until they became ingrained in my mind. It was as if the book had cast a spell on me, and I was powerless to resist its allure.\n\nOne night, as I lay in bed, I heard a soft whispering in my ear. It was a voice I had never heard before, but somehow, it felt familiar. It was as if the book was speaking to me, calling out to me from the darkness of the attic.\n\nI tried to ignore it, but the whispers grew louder and more insistent. They filled my mind, urging me to return to the book, to uncover its secrets, to learn its magic.\n\nAnd so, night after night, I would sneak up to the attic and lose myself in the stories. As time passed, I began to notice strange things happening around me. Objects would move on their own, shadows would shift and writhe, and the whispers in my ear grew more and more frenzied.\n\nOne night, I woke up to find myself standing in the middle of the attic, surrounded by a circle of candles. I had no memory of how I had gotten there, but I felt a strange power coursing through my veins. It was as if the book had infused me with its magic, and I was now a part of its ancient legacy.\n\nBut the more I delved into the book's secrets, the more I realized the true cost of its power. It demanded sacrifices, both physical and emotional, and it exacted a toll on my mind and body that I was not prepared to pay.\n\nAnd so, with a heavy heart, I returned the book to the attic and locked it away. I knew that its power was too great for me to handle, and that I was not ready to pay the price for its secrets.\n\nTo this day, I can still hear the whispers in my ear, urging me to return to the book. But I know that I can never go back, for fear that it will consume me once more.",

        "text": "My name is Alexandra, I am a 16 year old girl, I still live with my parents. I love both of my parents dearly, but someone in my family was always there for me when others weren't. Someone who was the apple of my eye, a family type of bond that I cannot explain how strong the bond was\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n. A soulmate. His name was Kodiak, he is a big fluffy love-able Newfoundland dog, his fur is a beautiful brown just like the Kodiak bear. I basically grew up with Kodiak my entire life, including my childhood. He was like a brother to me, except my bond between him and me is stronger than my actual brother. I believed our souls were related and meant to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cried my eyes out when the veterinarians told me he wouldn't live any longer than 2 years, he had a Cardiac Tumour growing onto his heart. I had booked an appointment with a different veterinarian who had told me that he would heal my dog, at first I thought this was too good to be true.\n\nHe told me a herb that can \"apparently heal\" the Tumour and reverse it. I trusted him. I trusted the veterinarian. I don't know what kind of idiot I am. I am depressed, I breakdown every time I think about my dog. I betrayed my own soulmate by a stupid foolish trickster. I am sorry, Kodiak I love you. I would've never let anyone hurt you. I am scared. But you aren't here for me anymore, Kodiak where are you. I don't know if I can move on without you, I want to be with you forever. Just me and you, nobody else here. That sure sounds great, I love you Kodiak. I can never forgive what I have done to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKodiak was taken from the veterinarian, I never got him back. What the veterinarian told me was clever lies disguised as a gift. I contacted the veterinarian, his name is Alfred, I took my dog to this veterinarian. The animal hospital was unique, the capacity only allowed 2 dogs max and the treatment was extra special and all professional. Alfred took classes for 10 years, mainly studying the dogs anatomy and the way the dogs bodies work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis vet office was mainly for dogs, I heard many great reviews from there. People told me their dogs were never so healthy before, one of the dog owners had even claimed he cured cancer. I was convinced and made a mistake because all humans do. I let him keep him \"temporarily\", according to him. Alfred took my dog because I thought he would fix him. It's been 3 months without my dog and no information from Alfred, I was worried. But I thought \"maybe this treatment takes a while\". I told myself everyday that there is nothing to worry about and Alfred wouldn't hurt my dog. I thought at least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing I found strange about Alfred was his obsession with my dog, he would always draw pictures of my dog's anatomy, he even talked about how he knew how to skin wolves. He joked about skinning my dog and wearing his skin, who would've thought that wasn't a joke. Tell me, who. Am I just an idiot. The weirdest thing he told me about is the science behind knotting in dogs, I never wanted to know. He even had a real dog's skeleton, with a dog's skin on top of the skeleton acting as a cloak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe veterinarian told me to wait, because he needed to go downstairs and nobody is allowed down there except him. I found this odd, really odd. Maybe that was his space where other dog's files were. Maybe to protect the privacy of the owners. Not to mention, he would also take strays or dogs with rabies, and he would claim he would heal them or just send them to dog shelters. Nobody ever heard from the dogs he would take, nobody even knew the shelters or where the \"cured dogs\" went, they've just assumed he gave them away for new homes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dog came back after 4 months, he was cured and healthy. I was so happy to see him, my eyes were pouring happy tears. But something was off about my dog, instead of being the happy energetic dog he used to be, he would rather sleep all day. He would avoid humans, and he didn't even like his favourite foods anymore. This wasn't Kodiak at all, I just thought he was depressed from not being at home for so long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe he and Alfred weren't getting along that well? But my dog also looked different, his eyes were more.... Human. His fur was not as vibrant as before, it looked like a tanned pelt. His paws, were oddly shaped. His snout also had a weird shape. He hated dog food, he refused even his favourite dog food. I gave him a plate of peas and mashed potatoes, he was starving and he never devoured food so fast. So I made a recipe that was safe for dogs to consume, he was no longer refusing food\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n. He had no energy as he used to, but he was up walking around and barking. His barking sounded very off, although. Kodiak never wagged his tail, the tail was stiff. I got pissed at my dog for the first time, he would refuse my love and he would growl and run away. I wasn't only just enraged, but I was also heartbroken to see my dog this way. I've tried to contact Alfred, but the number was apparently out of service, I've tried to find the location of the office.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was still there, I've even gone to the office. Alfred wasn't there, the other veterinarians had claimed they never knew \"Alfred\". Nor have they ever heard of him. So I screamed at the veterinarians because I knew something was always off about this \"Alfred\" guy and threatened to even burn their place down, and call the police on them. I was dead serious, I grabbed my phone and lighter. You should've seen the look on their faces when I stabbed one of them with my pocket knife, I knew that Kodiak wasn't my dog. I was 100% positive. The police were called on me, before I could even take a look downstairs. The police were already there, I had told them about my dog. They let me go, but they didn't check the office because they had other \"duty\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got home, there was Kodiak sitting on the couch staring at me with his unsettling human-like eyes. I went to the couch to sit beside him, he was making weird whimpering noises. A noise that I've never heard a dog make. His crying was getting louder so I went up to Kodiak and started to pet him, I scratched his belly and I felt something on his belly. I looked under his tummy, I saw a zipper and I was confused. So out of curiosity, I unzipped his zipper. I saw human skin, it looked like a human stomach. I saw that my dog's skin was literally sewed onto the person. I panicked and started to question the human inside of the dog, he was whimpering and struggling to speak. I remember. When the human inside of the dog stood up on his hind legs, his paws and feet were oddly shaped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis legs and arms were human. He didn't even pretend to act like a dog anymore. He started to walk on his hind legs, he started to mumble things. I asked him if I could take a look inside of his mouth. I think he agreed because he sat down and opened his mouth. I look inside of his mouth. There was a man inside of my dog, my dog's jaw was attached to his so when he barked, the mouth would move. My dog had been skinned and his face had been turned into a taxidermy so I wouldn't suspect a thing. When I say his eyes were human, his eyes didn't have any dog features. I didn't know how I thought this was normal, I went crazy. The human-dog now lived with me, he would play his role as a dog when visitors came. But with just me and him, he walked around like a human.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEating, sleeping, drinking and watching T.V as a human. Keep in mind that it was horrifying, I saw that other brown Newfoundland dogs had been sewn onto my dogs skin so that a man could fit inside. He was now my new companion, he would listen better. He would even still play fetch and play card games with me. Alfred called me, he told me that this is what he'd done, he knew I wanted my dog to live longer. So Alfred said, \" I thought, why not make him live as long as human\". He had told me he skinned and tanned my dog, and got a taxidermist to do his face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe drugged a man, and sewed the dog onto him. He told me the man wanted to become a dog, so he told the man he would make a realistic suit for him and find him an owner. Basically he just did what both of us wanted, except not in a way what we wanted. So I decided to go along with it and accept the fact that this human-dog is now my companion. I fed him, I played card games with him, I treated him like a dog and a human being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe still ate out of a dog bowl, he would sit with me and eat meals at the dinner table. Basically, because Alfred wasn't his real name and Alfred kept his identity a secret. The police couldn't do anything, if they tried taking the suit off of this man, he would die. My dog's skin is becoming infused with his skin, I couldn't do anything and the man had told me he is pretty happy with his new life. He had his own dog house outside, and had his own dog bed.\n\nBasically, I have my dog but forever, basically this man got his dream but also forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe careful of what you wish for. It may not be what it seems.",

        "text": "He walked in through the window. At the moment I didn't think much of it, but now thinking back at it, I wonder how he climbed all the way to the 4th floor. I was too scared to think then. I knew the lights flickering weren't so normal as the weather was relatively good. Someone must have messed with the cords outside. Then they went off. I had some candles decorated here and there so I lit the place up just so I can move around. \n\nI saw his figure standing by the window. Behind the dim candlelight I could hardly see his face, but his large figure betrayed him. I didn't know that many people twice my size and double my weight that would just climb into my apartment at the late night hours..\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" I asked, after the first moment of shock.\n\n\"Shut the f\\*ck up.\" he said. \"It's time.\"\n\n\"Time for what? What do you mean?\"\n\nHe didn't reply. He just walked to me with a swiss knife pointed to my face and pushed me to the couch. I didn't try to fight him back; I simply sat back and looked at him, holding a knife in my face and trying to choke me with his other hand. I knew he wouldn't hurt me. This was just foreplay to us.\n\nThen I saw: small bruised spots on his arm. Heroine. \n\nI tried to ask but I never got to. Before I knew he had pulled me up -holding me by the neck- and tossed me on one of the chairs around the table. Put his hand over my mouth and warned me not to make a sound as he pulled out some duct tape from his pocket. He put a piece over my mouth and placed his finger on where my lips were. Signal for me to stay silent. I obeyed.\n\nI just watched him tie me up on the chair. Wasting an entire roll of duct tape trying to make me completely immobile. He took small pauses to light a cigarette and admire his work, see how else he could tie me. I couldn't move any part of me. This wasn't foreplay anymore. I couldn't think of any sex-play involving me tied like this on a chair. I just looked at him with a million questions I couldn't speak.\n\n\"I'm sorry that I'm doing this to you.\" He spoke taking a last drag from his cigarette. \"I don't know why. I want you to watch. I want to look at you.\" He pulled the tape off my mouth for a moment and leaned close. I dont know if he saw it, as my candles weren't exactly bright at that spot, but I could feel my tears burn my cheeks as I gradually realised what he was about to do.. He cupped my cheeks and kissed me as I started crying..\n\n\"Don't cry for me. It's not worth it.\" \n\nHe looked at me with pity. Took a chair and sat himself across of me, watching my cry for a few minutes without saying anything. He carved his skin gently with his own swiss knife, creating small red lines on his veins. \n\nHe sat on the floor, \n\nlooked into my eyes\n\nand slit his wrists.",

        "text": "I would like to note that this is my uncle's story, not mine. I will also be writing this through my uncle's perspective when the event occurred. \n\n-Thanks, OP\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess the whole event took place in the summer of '75. I was about 13. For the story to make since, I'll start with context\n\nMy mother divorced my dad due to his issues with alcoholism, and quickly got custody over me and my five siblings. My dad was struggling greatly, so he made what was most likely the best decision, to move to a remote log cabin in Montana. He also had pretty serious mental problems. Because of his problems and the severity of them, my mom decided to never really let us stay at his cabin. She claims that she made a good decision, but I really feel like she accidentally made things worse, just isn't brave enough to own up to it.\n\nAnyway, my mother finally decided to let me fly up to my Dad's cabin for a week, mostly because she felt like he needed someone in his life. Someone of his own flesh and blood to just be there for him. I wasn't very pleased with the decision at first, but my mother just told me to suck it up, so I did. \n\nThe first day I arrived, my dad picked me up in his Ford '67 and we drove off. From the start, I could immediately tell that he was really bad off. He was very unkempt, he smelled like sweat and cheap deodorant, and he just gave off the vibe that he had practically hit rock bottom in life. But despite all that, I could tell he was happy to see me. \n\nFor the rest of the day, we just took it easy, I helped him with some housework, and just got to know each other. Everything was calm as could be until the Sun set.\n\nThat night, as I tucked myself into bed, I heard a sound. It sounded like something scratching against the window, and I also remember a faint deep, guttural sound. It honestly scared the shit out of me. But I was never a brave kid, so I just pretended it wasn't there and fell asleep after a while.\n\nThe next morning, I decided to tell my dad about what I heard, to which he replied \"It was probably just some coyote or puma.\" I was pretty sure it wasn't a puma or coyote, but I went with it anyway.\n\nThe next night, I heard the exact same thing I heard the night before, just louder. I tried to convince myself that it was just an animal, but deep down, I knew there was no way that the noise was from an animal, regardless of what it was. \n\nI begged my dad to let me sleep somewhere else, but he didn't seem to take me seriously. I guess he just thought I was joking or something? \n\nWith my nerves practically screaming in fear, I tried to suck it up and sleep that night. But of course, it was back, and louder than ever. That's when I made the bold decision to look outside the window and hopefully, see that my concerns were over nothing. What I saw instead stuck with me permanently.\n\nI saw some humanoid creature on hands and knees, scratching at my window. It's body was thin and very lanky, and resembled a human with white skin aside from its head. It's head was the bloody skull of a buck. We even made eye-to-socket contact. \n\nI screamed and screamed and shut my eyes. I only opened them once I heard my dad running in from his room. When I opened my eyes, the creature was gone. Thankfully, my dad started to believe me from this point on.\n\nIt's been about forty years since the incident, and I still remember all of it like a nightmare you can never forget. My dad passed away seven years later, apparently from a \"breaking and entering gone wrong\". I don't think I want to know what they meant by \"gone wrong. \n\nThankfully, my dad is in a better place now, and I just hope that one day, I'll forget what happened and I'll be at peace too",

        "text": "I've never told anyone this before.  I was ashamed.  But I am writing this to justify all my actions, especially those done towards my family.\n\n\n I'll start by saying I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I came home so rarely and ignored my parents far too many times.  I haven't contacted them in 4 months.  I'm sure my folks think I'm dead somewhere.  I'm not far from it.\n\n\nIt all started in the last year of high school.  I had plans.  Plans that I had to respect.  For the past few months, something strange has been happening in my bedroom every night.  I was awakened in the middle of the night by the sensation of cold breath on the back of my neck.  I would open my eyes, turn around and it seemed like there was a black figure next to me, lying next to me, covered under my blanket.  I could even see his figure in the mirror next to the bed.  Every time I tried to remove the blanket, the creature disappeared.  I would go to bed, wake up in the morning and everything was normal.  It was as if my memory was erased and I wasn't paying much attention to what happened.  Many times, many nights, I didn't even notice that cold feeling on my neck.\n\n\nI was telling myself that it was all just in my mind, that that event was caused by fatigue and I was left with only fear from now on.\n\n\nThat is until he started talking to me.  I would hear whispers spoken in my ear, or even songs hummed by a male voice.  I could feel the touch of thin fingers on my hair.  He was no longer afraid of me, and I was no longer afraid of him.\n\n\nThe mistake was coming home one evening drunk, when my parents were away.  Then, I felt it was all or nothing.  That I have nothing to lose.  I accepted all of that creature's advances, or from the way he was acting, he was probably just a strange man creeping into my bed, I don't know where and I don't know how.  Well, at that point it didn't matter anymore.\n\n\nAfter that night, I never saw him again.  It was as if I missed him.  So many nights I felt like I had company because of him.  I was hoping he would come back.  Especially after I found out I was pregnant.  Surely he had to know that this happened.  I was too young and stupid to take responsibility.  I needed him to come and find a solution for me.\n\n\nMonths passed and my belly started to grow.  A pregnancy was not yet suspected, I could hide the extra kilos by saying that I gained weight due to the stress of the end of the year.  Luckily, the year is over and I was able to leave home for college.\n\nI gave birth alone.  I had no one around.  I hid it from everyone close to me.  I was ashamed.  How was I going to explain everything and who was going to believe me?\n\nThe real nightmare started after the birth.  The pregnancy did not give me too much trouble and the birth was by caesarean section.  I had to find a job to support myself and my daughter while I continued college.  I managed to get a studio apartment with rent at a lower price thanks to a friend I met in college, the studio apartment being her parents'.\n\n\nYears went by, and my girl started to look more and more like me.  Many parents would be happy and proud to say that.  But I don't mean the banal way that all parents refer to.  I mean my daughter was me.  It looked identical to me.  It was absolutely impossible how much we looked alike.  I gave birth to myself.\n\n\nI am now 30 years old and I cannot say that I have changed much or that I have aged.  I am the same as I was in my 20s.  It was as if time stood still for me.  My daughter, on the other hand, looks more mature than her age.  She looks like me.  Yesterday, without me knowing, she went to my parents' door.  They don't suspect anything.  How could they?  They think it's me 100%.  Therefore, there cannot be 2 selves.  I have to give my parents the daughter they never had.  I have to fix my mistake.  Maybe my daughter will not follow in my footsteps and will be more careful.  Farewell.",

        "text": "I'll never forget the first time I saw it, hovering at the foot of my bed. My two eyes were met by hundreds, maybe thousands. Even in the darkness I could see them regarding me with hate. \n\nPart of me was impressed that I hadn't screamed or had a heart attack when I saw it. I was frozen in place, cold beads of sweat on my forehead. \n\nLight from the street lamp came through the slits of my shades, revealing a thing that looked bulbous yet muscular. Appendages would sprout and disappear in between the eyes in fluid movements. \n\nMy vision started to blur. Despite the intruder in my bedroom, I started to doze. The beat of my heart slowed until I fell asleep. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, there was no trace of the thing.  It must have been a nightmare,  I thought.\n\nTwo nights later, the intruder returned. Once again I was frozen in place, my eyes fixed on the terrifying thing hovering at the foot of my bed.\n\nI tried to scream, but my mouth wouldn't move. The thing's eyes seemed to squint a little. \n\n\"Why are you doing this to me,\" I thought. \n\nIn my head I heard laughter. Not the type of laughter you hear when someone tells a joke, but the type of laughter you hear when someone laughs at someone else's expense. \n\nJust like the previous visit, my vision blurred and I fell into a deep sleep. \n\nThe third visit was almost the same. The laughing was more raucous and cruel. \n\nAfter the third visit, I scheduled an appointment with my doctor. \n\nShe gave me a look over and decided that I didn't show symptoms of any sort of head trauma. No signs of a stroke either. \n\n\"Shouldn't I get a brain scan or something,\" I said in a panicked tone. \n\n\"I don't THINK you need a brain scan,\" she said, \"but if YOU do, then I am more than happy to sign off on it\". \n\nFor a moment I felt stupid, though why should I? I was here because there was a monster floating at the foot of my bed.  Or at least that's what I thought. \n\n\"You think I'm crazy don't you?\"\n\nShe shook her head and smiled. \n\n\"No, I don't think your crazy. I think you must be under a lot of stress. Tell me, are you too scared to move during these episodes, or is it that you CAN'T move?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I don't think I can move when it happens. Though to be honest I'm too scared to try\". \n\nShe nodded and typed something into the computer. \n\n\"I want you to make a concrete sleep schedule, something that you follow all the time\".\n\n\"Okay\".\n\n\"I also want to prescribe some anti depressants\".\n\n\"I'm not depressed though\".\n\nShe smiled and continued. \n\n\"I'm not saying you have depression, but from your description I think you may be suffering from sleep paralysis\".\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It usually happens when you are falling asleep or waking up. You're mind is awake, but your body isn't just yet. Your limbs won't move, you can't speak. Sometimes patients say they see things, like unwanted visitors. Some sort of dark intruder\".\n\n\"You think that this thing is, a hallucination\". \n\n\"I tend to think so.\" \n\n\"I'm not big on pills\".\n\n\"I know, but I think in this situation they'll help. It will take a few weeks for them to really kick in\".\n\nThere weren't any visitations for a few weeks. I marveled at how fast the medicine worked. About a month later, the thing returned. \n\nI could hear it laughing in my head. \n\n\"Did you think that medicine would cure you of ME?\"\n\nThe laughing continued. \n\n\"Who are you? What are you? Why are you doing this to me?\"\n\nThe intruders eyes seemed to smile. \n\n\"I felt you from across the vast darkness\". \n\n\"Me, what makes me so special?\"\n\n\"Bah, not you. Your world. I felt you from the void.  I wonder if you are worthy of being spared\". \n\n\"What do you mean worth sparing?\"\n\n\"Your species is so arrogant. You believe that you are alone in the universe. You aren't even alone in this room. Tiny creatures and germs, more interesting and competent than you share the space of this room. There are other worlds, other beings. Entities far older, wiser, and stronger than you. We see you. Your thoughts, your prayers, your communications, they find us. In the void we hear you live your measly lives and we go unnoticed. Even now, as I reveal myself to you, you do not show the proper reverence for your betters\".\n\n\"What do you mean worth sparing I said\".\n\n\"I heard you the first time and did not care. In so many ways, you have shouted out to the stars. Sometimes willingly, sometimes unwittingly. You call to many things, and we come from across the vast expanse of existence\".\n\n\"You came in a ship?\"\n\n\"No, this visage which appears before you is an astral projection. I am grand\".\n\nBefore I could ask what it meant, I seemed to be floating in space. In front of me there was a vast form. Black eyes the size of lakes. Limbs the size of buildings grew and shrunk  from the mass in fluid movements. The thing must have been as large as a moon. \n\nThe entire conversation was through thought alone. My voice and my lips were useless.  I could feel tears streaming down my cheeks as I witnessed this horrible thing.\n\n\"We come from the darkened pockets of space and time. I am not alone in my journey. Others like me are travelling great distances to reach your world. Some would devour you as leviathans swallow tiny creatures in your seas. Others would conquer you, to bend you to their will.\"\n\nI wept, looking into a single eye. Like the thing I was a projection, but I could feel the cold of space in my fingertips and unbearable heat radiating from the mass in front of me. \n\n\"Are we a meal to you? Are we slaves to you? Is that what you want?!?\"\n\n\" I am the great cataclysm. I am the destroyer of unworthy worlds and vile things unfit to exist. Your world called to me, offering itself up for judgement.  So far I  am unimpressed\".\n\n\"Who are you to\"....\n\nBefore I could finish my protest, I could feel my head squeezing. \n\n\"I could pop your tiny mind like the infection it is\". \n\nThe pain was unbearable. \n\n\"Please, please\".\n\nThe thing laughed again. For a moment I thought my skull would crack, then my brain would explode out into space. With every moment of pain, the laughter grew louder. Right when I thought I was about to die, the squeezing stopped. So did the laughter. \n\n\"You may be worth sparing after all\". \n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because....I find you....amusing\".\n\nI was baffled and offended. \n\n\"I shall spare your world for now. But know this. I am STILL coming. One of the others may reach you first, but for now... I shall spare you\".\n\nI was back in my bedroom. Blood was flowing from my nose my shirt was drenched in it. \n\n\"Remember,\" the thing said. \n\nFrom time to time the thing intrudes my bedroom. At first, I didn't know what it meant when it said I was amusing. In time I learned the thing found joy in my pain. Physical or emotional, it didn't matter. \n\nI learned I wasn't the only one it visited. Around the world there are others. Humans and animals alike waking in the night to be tormented by a thing that finds pleasure in their discomfort. \n\nFor now it is sparing us. So long as we stay \"amusing\".",

        "text": "It was the year 2019, and I was working as a marine biologist, researching the depths of the Pacific Ocean. I had always been fascinated by the mysteries that lay beneath the waves, but nothing could have prepared me for what I discovered.\n\nIt was a routine expedition, and we were exploring an area that had never been seen before. As we delved deeper, our cameras picked up something unusual, and we moved in for a closer look. That's when we saw them - three beings, floating in the darkness, their bodies made completely of light. I couldn't believe my eyes - this was something that defied all explanation.\n\nWe brought the creatures to the surface, and I began to communicate with them. It was a surreal experience, but as we talked, they began to reveal something truly terrifying. They told me about a series of events that would unfold over the next ten years, events that would lead to the extinction of humanity. I was shaken to my core - how could this be possible?\n\nThe events began with the outbreak of a deadly virus in late 2019, one that spread rapidly across the globe, infecting millions of people. The virus was highly contagious and had a mortality rate of over 3%, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history. It was the beginning of the end.\n\nAs the years went on, the events only became more terrifying. In 2020, wildfires ravaged Australia, causing widespread devastation and killing billions of animals. The following year, a massive explosion rocked Beirut, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands more. Then came the murder hornets, a species of hornet that had never been seen in North America before. They were ruthless, killing entire bee colonies and threatening our food supply.\n\nThe years continued to pass, and the events became more and more complex. In 2022, a massive iceberg broke off from Antarctica, leading to rising sea levels and the displacement of millions of people. In 2023, a deadly earthquake struck Japan, triggering a devastating tsunami that killed thousands. In 2024, a massive drought hit California, leading to water shortages and food insecurity.\n\nBut the worst was yet to come. In 2025, a massive asteroid struck the Earth, wiping out entire cities and killing billions of people. It was a cataclysmic event, one that would change the course of human history forever.\n\nAs the years passed, the events only became more terrifying. In 2026, a massive solar flare caused widespread power outages, leading to chaos and anarchy in many cities. In 2027, a deadly new strain of influenza emerged, killing millions of people and further weakening our already fragile global health system. And in 2028, climate change led to a massive melting of the polar ice caps, causing sea levels to rise even further and leading to the displacement of even more people.\n\nIt was now the year 2029, and the world was a very different place from what it had been just ten years before. The events that the beings had predicted had come to pass, and humanity was on the brink of extinction. As I looked out at the world, I knew that there was nothing left to do but wait for the end to come.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, the beings were gone. They vanished into the ether, leaving behind only a sense of foreboding and a feeling of impending doom. As I looked out at the world, I knew that the end was near, and that there was nothing we could do to stop it. The only thing left to do was to wait, and to pray for a miracle that would never come.",

        "text": "My mother and I have always been close. We tend to move around a lot, and she could never really hold a solid job, but no matter what, no matter the financial situation, no matter where we lived, no matter who else was there, we always had each other. I love my mother-she always tried her best to keep us safe. It was hard, traveling about, just two young women, but we made it work. She was my rock and I was hers.\n\nAround the time I was 15 she finally got the money together to get a down payment on a proper house, finally giving us one constant in life. Move in was easy, we had little furniture, a few possessions, and overall were just moving the items of 2 people. We didn’t have many delicate items to move- my mother banned all mirrors, most books, and most cosmetics. \n\nWe got everything all set up, and haven’t made many adjustments since. Everything was fine for the first month or so, then the noises started. It started in the walls, the small scratching noises. We assumed it was rats, or roaches, or some other form of small pest. We couldn’t afford an exterminator, and for sure couldn’t afford to have the walls messed with, so we cut a portion of wall off in the living room and poured drain cleaner in it, hoping whatever was in there would consume it and die off, making our lives quieter. When the noises persisted, we kept adding things-vinegar, peroxide, bleach, baking soda, anything, hoping that maybe at least it will form some sort of gas that the pest could inhale. Still, nothing. It was hard to tell what we were up against, anyway, because while there were always scurrying noises, the size of what was causing them always seemed to change. It would sound as though a small ant was in there, then later sound as though God himself was trying to get out. We eventually gave up, deciding that whatever was in there wasn’t doing anything besides making noise. We had cut a hole in every room, nearly every room, and still found nothing. \n\nThe house was nearly inhospitable at that point, as every time we cut a hole, we poured whatever we could find in it, causing a stench to permeate the house. By the time you grew used to the scent, we would need to cut another hole, and therefore, more, new poisons to breathe in. We couldn’t leave the house-my mother would surely be attacked if I left her alone, as would I if the roles were reversed. We couldn’t leave together-that would make it too easy for them to take us both at the same time. We were both on the more petite size-something that tends to happen to you when near every food will make you sick, so it wouldn’t be hard to just pick us up and throw us in the back of that small green hatchback car, always circling the block, always slowing down. \n\nThat’s why we had to keep the windows always closed. We couldn’t go upstairs because the stairway window didn’t have curtains, and it would be too much of a risk to be in front of the window long enough to install a curtain rod, and besides, women can’t do handiwork like that, and we didn’t have a man in the house, so we would have to get a worker in the house, and that could never happen. Even with the windows covered we couldn’t go upstairs, because they would hear us walking around, it would be easier for them to hear our footsteps overhead. \n\nWe ended up boarding off the downstairs bedroom, one specific floorboard always creaked, which means it had been tampered with, which means there was some sort of recording device in it. \n\nIt quickly became unbearable in there- the boredom was the biggest piece of it. No technology-obviously, but we also couldn’t have so much as books-it was easy to become engrossed in it, we would get distracted, and wouldn’t be able to keep a proper watch on our surroundings\n\nWe boarded off the basement, for obvious reasons-there were always noises, and the lighting down there was non-existent, so who knows what could be down there. Enough said. \n\nAnd that’s how we lived-huddled together in the living room, lights out so they couldn’t see we were in there, windows blocked out, no distractions, only the fear. The world isn’t safe. The world will continue to be unsafe. The world will continue to be unsafe.",

It’s sunny, but the clouds start to roll in and quickly the weather becomes overcast. Something’s wrong. Long strands start falling from the sky above, reaching down towards me. I try to move, try to run, try to do anything at all, but I can’t move.\n\nThey grab me, and hoist me up. I am pulled upwards, further and further, into the newly born blanket of gloomy clouds. Above me, the upside-down surface of a lake approaches at a great speed, before I am plunged into it and pulled through.\n\nI hang in a grey abyss, held still by unseen forces. It’s so cold. Things move around me in the murk, but I can’t make out their shapes. They approach, curiously, and grow bolder. They reach out, nipping my body. More and more start to attack, each time stealing away a tiny part of my body.\n\nThe assaults increase. Larger and larger parts of me are torn away and lost to the haze around me. Yet even after the last fragment of my body is taken away, I remain. I see and hear everything as a being of perception alone. But I cannot look around, nonexistent limbs refuse to cooperate. No matter my yearning to scream, no sound is produced from a mouth that is no longer there.\n\nIt is torment, and infinity.\n\nSorry, I had to write all that down first thing, wouldn’t want to forget such an astounding dream. Well, nightmare moreover.\n\nAs for the rest of this, I had a very hard time putting any of it to paper. I seem to have recovered now, but forgive me if there are things I’ve missed out.\n\n.\n\nFollowing that terrible dream, I woke up in a frenzied confusion. I felt terrible, foggy. Where was I? What was the time, and date?\n\nWho was I?\n\nRubbing my head, legs hanging off the edge of the mattress, I looked around to see one other, empty bed. Was I here by myself, or… was there someone else here?\n\nSomeone else… Arthur, no, Angela… Angie? Annie… ANNIE? Where was Annie?\n\nThrough the haze I somehow willed my brain into recalling who I’d come to this forsaken place with. I tried to stand up from the bed, but my legs buckled and I toppled onto hands and knees. The cool stone floor definitely gave me strength, dispelling some of the abhorrent mist that clouded in my head.\n\nPushing myself back up with an effort that felt like the last rep of a push-up set, I found myself on my feet once more, albeit with wobbling knees. I reached a hand out to the wall to steady myself, and after gaining some composure I was able to start walking.\n\nThe door to this room hung wide open, but there was no one outside.\n\n*God, Annie, where have they taken you? What are they doing to you?*\n\nI stumbled and tripped down a seemingly endless hallway, and like smoke, or vapour, a man suddenly appeared in front of me. I bumped into him, but he caught me in his arms and hoisted me back up, both hands on my shoulders.\n\n“My friend, are you okay? What are you doing?” he said, with a concerned tone.\n\nWho the hell was this guy? He had the weirdest haircut, like ripples on the surface of a pond, and wore the most dazzling robes. Any shadow that fell upon them was washed away in place of their vibrant colours.\n\nI tried to speak, but my native language had not yet come back in its entirety,\n\n“I, eh, wh- where am, is, Ann… ie?”\n\nThe man shot me a quizzical look, then took my hand, turning around and leading me somewhere.\n\n“I think it’s time you leave, for your own wellbeing. You will recover soon. I will prepare a brew that should nurse you back into being.”\n\nI don’t remember the journey, but I found myself sitting on a bench with a steaming cup in my hand. It was hot, really hot, and I dropped it reflexively. The man was still with me, and without a word he filled another cup and placed it down next to me, clearing up the one that had just shattered on the ground.\n\nThis time, I waited to let the drink cool, and then drank half in one gulp. The warm sensation travelling into my stomach was pleasant, and the effects of its contents were made apparent as clarity found me again, and memories came flooding back.\n\nI groaned, took a few deep inhales, then got up and asked,\n\n“Can I- we, please leave now, Dominika… sorry, Domimokah?”\n\n“Absolutely. I should have sent you on your way yesterday, regrettably. But alas, here we are. Though, before that, would you like to say your farewells?”\n\n“My farewells… yeah, yeah of course, thanks for the hospitality, I-“\n\n“Oh, no, no,” he interjected, “I meant, to your friend.”\n\nA pang of adrenaline cut through me as I heard that. Why would I be saying farewell to Annie? Unless…\n\n“Wh- no, what have you done? Where is Annie? I want to get her and leave, where is she?!”\n\nWordlessly, Domimokah beckoned me to follow. With no other choice, I complied, and after a short walk we arrived back in the skull room, complete with its burning incense, polished floor, monks, Annie…\n\n*Annie? No, god, please.*\n\nI… I was too late. I didn’t recognise her at first, but I’d recognise that shade of brunette anywhere, tufts peeking out from underneath a funnel-shaped hat.\n\n“N-no… fuuuck, no, ANNIE! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?” I screamed, thrashing out of Domimokah’s grip.\n\n“Please, stop this. I implore you. It was of her own choice to join us. Nothing was forced upon her.”\n\n“I- I don’t believe you! How, how the FUCK could you possibly have done this?!?”\n\nMy weakened legs carried me towards her, but again, that whistle sounded, and I was quickly restrained by a pair of brainless monks. I pulled, shouted, fought to escape, but it was no use.\n\n“I think that is more than enough. The Well speaks, the presence of this man is welcome no more. Yerhemmi, please escort him out with haste.”\n\nThe other man, Yerhemmi, appeared from nowhere, from somewhere behind me, and took my arm in a grip of steel. It was an unnatural strength, from something else within him. Something that shouldn’t be there.\n\n“No, no! Stop! Let me take her, PLEASE!”\n\nThe whole time my head was turned backward, screaming out for Annie, even though I knew there was no possible scenario she could return with me.\n\nMy throat was shredded by the time we arrived back at the entrance. There, Yerhemmi halted his march, and turned to me with a grim expression.\n\n“You must leave this place, quickly. The great Well covets you, now. It has allowed you to peer inside it, but I can sense its revulsion to your gaze. Please, run, do not linger here one minute longer.”\n\nIn those final moments, I finally saw the pink scar tissue encircling his head. Before I had the time to properly understand this, he pushed me forward, jumpstarting my muscles into action.\n\nI tumbled down the slope in dust and brittle leaves. From above sounded a soul-twisting vibration, and I dared not look. My descent was broken and I rolled across the ledge, the path I had taken with Annie to reach this terrible place.\n\nAll my limbs were scratched and scraped, but through a divine miracle nothing was broken or sprained. My shoes scraped across the ground, gaining traction, and I ran with all the energy I had left.\n\nAs I fled, the sun’s light began to dim, and a dark front slid over the ground, stretching far away from me. Nothing could distract me now, booking it at full speed down the time-worn trail. Sounds like thunder erupted from far above, an awful crackling resonance that penetrated flesh and bone.\n\nLungs screamed, muscles burned. None of that mattered. Even if I never walked again, I would absolutely choose that over being taken by the incomprehensible madness, the same one whose eyes were on me.\n\nWithout warning, my foot caught on something and I rolled head over heels, gashing my cheek on a sharp stone in the process. I forced through the dizziness, and turned to sit upright.\n\nA mistake. Oh, what a mistake. In doing so, I’d unwillingly turned around to face back from where I came. I’d tripped over some strange, black object… it hit me then, what had hindered my escape, it was the same blackened, seared corpse of the mountain lion from days before. No more white flames this time, but… I don’t know why, but I looked up.\n\nImmediately I regretted this decision, as I saw those dark grey coils tighten around each other, in a way that made my head ache. They condensed, twisted, and grew impossibly, until a colossal blanket smothered the midday sky. It dwarfed the formation we’d seen before, tenfold larger in size and span. I didn't want to acknowledge it, but the cerebral shape of the formation was obvious now.\n\nThen… they parted. Like Moses parting the Red Sea, the great cloud separated down the middle. What I thought to be sunlight was re-emerging, clawing its way out of the dark mass, but it wasn’t sunlight. It wasn’t anything close.\n\nThe sky between the clouds cracked and splintered, and it ruptured. A vast split cleaved apart the heavens, widening into a gaping fissure, leading to somewhere else entirely. It was so bright. God, it felt like staring into a military flashlight. I had to shield my eyes from certain damage.\n\nThe colourless void stirred. Out of the fractured sky, uncountable strands fell out like dangling ropes. Only, they were huge, unfathomably so. They danced about the orange peaks like pale snakes, but they weren’t… they were that same pure, blinding flame that had plagued this journey.\n\nAnd every single one slithered through the air towards me. Every last one. They were distant still, but even then I could feel the radiating hunger that wanted to eat all that I was, everything I’d ever known.\n\nI let out a shriek, which was retorted by a deafening wail. A sound that was the embodiment of the collective despair of tortured minds. I hated it so much, nothing since has come close to instilling the raw terror I had in that moment.\n\nI scrambled to my feet and turned, almost falling again as my feet slipped on the ground. At that time I could have beaten a champion sprinter, doped by pure adrenaline. I fear that I’d not been soon enough, as I felt a weight, something of substance, crawling out from my eyes and ears, caught in the gravity of my pursuer. The skin on my face bubbled, small patches sloughing away with my air resistance. To this day, I have never felt such a scathing heat. As if the flames of Lucifer himself were reaching out to me, lapping at my soul.\n\nDreading the loss of anything else, my mind went blank as all power was directed to my legs. My feet were in agony, slapping down on rocks and dust over and over, and my chest felt tight. I would still rather die from a heart attack than be caught.\n\nI felt my consciousness slipping, blotches covering my vision like I’d stared at the sun for too long. I didn’t slow one bit, though. It was like my body had entered full autopilot. As the red and purple spots spread over my sight, I heard words spoken to me. Well, not spoke, more like something had hijacked my internal monologue in order to convey itself.\n\n“…not return, not yet, for thy self is sweet and succulent, to be savoured. Long has it been…”\n\nThat’s all I could remember in any meaningful way. Invasive thoughts of oblivion swam about my head, and at this point I was practically blind.\n\nI don’t remember much of the next part. There were several “blinks” in perception, and each time I caught glimpses, vague outlines of new surroundings. The blinks became less frequent, and I came back to full lucidity to find myself teetering on the edge of a steep hill.\n\nI’d learned not to look and see what was behind by now, so I shot down the slope, almost skating with my trainers as skiis. An intense flash of light hit my eyes and I feared for the worst, but it went as quickly as it had come.\n\nClenching my eyelids a couple of times to clear my vision, I could see that the light had been reflected off of a vehicle’s hood. A grey range-rover. Annie’s range-rover. It didn’t even register to me at first that it was likely I didn’t have the keys. In fact, I wasn’t even aware of the pack slung over my back until I slowed to a stop and felt its weight.\n\nI tore it off, unzipping to reveal the contents. No tent, of course, but I still had my notepad and laptop, mostly undamaged by some miracle. A few wires, empty wrappers… no key.\n\nMy heart dropped, but I persisted and shook the bag up and down. There was definitely something rattling in there, and I remembered the pouch on the inside of the bag. The lip was hidden at first, but I reached in and grasped something cold and hard.\n\nI’m not saying I would live through all of that again to experience the same feeling, but the unadulterated, euphoric relief that rushed over me was incomparable. I did indeed have the keys to the rover.\n\nNot skipping a beat, I fumbled to unlock the driver side door, and clambered inside. The first comfortable seat in hours. I sat there for a good ten minutes before I even considered starting her up, letting my pulverised joints recover. It would be a real shame to die in a car accident after only just escaping with my life, and sanity.\n\nI won’t bore you detailing the drive, but I felt a deep sense of regret the whole way home. Surely I could have done something to save Annie. I mean, she didn’t have any brain to speak of now, but I feel that killing her would have been a mercy. It kills me to know that she’s out there somewhere, in the clutches of that… thing.\n\nThe shock started its onset barely five minutes from home. The burning pain radiating across my face was subdued. I just about managed to get back and park safely. I exited the car and opened my front door, stepping inside with total vacancy. I made it a few steps into the living room before, ultimately, my legs gave out, and I collapsed from exhaustion.\n\nI woke up later, seeing it had already started to grow dark outside. For a blissful moment, I was spared the memories of all that had happened. It was short-lived though, and as it came rushing back, my eyes widened and I jumped up off the floor.\n\nI called 911 and requested an officer. Who could’ve guessed to see Davis standing on my porch, after opening the door to urgent-sounding knocks.\n\nI explained everything. Well, not everything, in truth. I wasn’t even sure if I could understand half of what I’d witnessed, and I didn’t want to come off as bat-shit crazy while giving a formal report, even if it was with Davis.\n\nI think he could tell I needed the rest, and told me he’d come back tomorrow to discuss further. A missing persons report was filed immediately, since we’d already been out on the trail for a few days, and a recovery team was sent out to the Salt Point trails.\n\nThe case was kept confidential, so I don’t really know much beyond that. I even felt a pang of guilt, having them sent out to that place, in that they might also never come back.\n\nWhat I do know is they never found Annie. Not that it surprised me. Even if they did, she may as well be dead, and likely would be if she ever left that place.\n\nI never want to go back there. Ever. The fear of losing your entire self, all that composes you, is something I’ve never come to terms with. It is the feeling of unimaginable loss, becoming irretrievable in the hands of something old. Something hungry.\n\nStill, I’ve tried to look into the place over and over again. There’s nothing on satellite images, but the strangest thing is that no matter how I try to remember, to remind myself of where it was, or how exactly to get there, I never learn anything. It’s like the knowledge is permanently lost, like even if I were to dedicate every day of the rest of my life to discovering it, I’d turn up empty handed. Empty headed, rather.\n\nThat in itself terrifies me to no end. The fact that something so trivial as a location is now forbidden, my mind repelling any attempts to re-learn the whereabouts. I know where the Salt Point trails are, where the car was parked, but beyond that I cannot fathom.\n\nI would write for Annie here, the whole, “if you’re out there,” thing, but I know in my heart that she will find no rest. Only eternal dissolution, the total loss of everything unique and dear to her. One could see it as a hell of sorts, to be an undying being of unbiased perception, knowing and remembering all from everywhere, but without the ability to solidify any of those thoughts or memories.\n\nI don’t think I’m gonna try to sell this story after all. It would be an insult to my partner in crime, but even disregarding that, it would just read as a jumbled mess of nonsensical events, likely the deranged hallucinations of a sun-stricken man.\n\nSo I think I’ll just keep these posts up, on here. This is a warning. There’s something deep in the hills of Utah, and it is not benevolent. It is unnatural. A deceiver between the peaks. This is not just a piece of creative writing. If you were to encounter whatever is out there, you’ll wish you’d never been born. Endless non-existence is child’s play in the face of it.\n\nI don’t think anything I was told there was true. Well, maybe, but a heavily warped truth. One that even the monks themselves could not see through. I fear for them all, that beyond a shadow of a doubt, they have been deceived.\n\nWhat else can I say? If you ever find yourself deep in the hiking trails of Utah, or anywhere else, and you see alien clouds whirling in the sky… turn around, never look back, and do your best to forget. There is nothing there worth investigating.\n\n[It’s not worth it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rephlect/comments/11i8bf9/theres_a_deceiver_in_the_hills_of_utah_5/)",

        "text": "The woman had always known that her child was special. When she first held him in her arms, she felt a bond that she had never experienced before. But as he grew older, she realized that there was something different about him. He never smiled, never laughed, never even cried.\n\nAt first, she thought it was just a phase, but as the years went by, she realized that her child was not like other children. He was always distant, always detached. He never spoke, never looked her in the eye.\n\nThe woman tried everything to connect with her child. She took him to doctors, therapists, and specialists, but no one could help him. She spent hours every day trying to get him to smile, to laugh, to connect with her. But it was all for nothing.\n\nOne day, the woman could take it no more. She had reached her breaking point. She could no longer handle the constant rejection, the endless silence. She packed a bag and left in the middle of the night, never looking back.\n\nYears went by, and the woman thought that she had left her past behind. But one night, the thing came crawling back into her life.\n\nShe had been sitting in her apartment, watching TV, when she heard a sound from the hallway. It sounded like something was crawling on the floor. She got up to investigate, but as soon as she opened the door, she saw the thing.\n\nIt was her child, but not as she remembered him. His skin was pale and clammy, and his eyes were empty and lifeless. He crawled towards her, weeping and moaning, calling out to her in a haunting voice.\n\n\"Mommy, where are you? Mommy, come out and play with me.\"\n\nThe woman screamed and ran back into her apartment, locking the door behind her. She could hear the thing crawling around outside, weeping and moaning, calling out to her.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the woman never left her apartment. She had barricaded the door, but the thing was always there, crawling around outside, calling out to her. She could hear it weeping and moaning, calling out to her in a haunting voice.\n\nThe woman had not slept in days, and her mind was starting to play tricks on her. She could hear voices whispering in her ear, telling her to let the thing in, to face her fears. She knew it was all in her head, but she could not shake the feeling that the thing was real.\n\nFinally, the woman could take it no more. She decided to face her fears and confront the thing. She grabbed a small knife and opened the door.\n\nThe thing was waiting for her, its eyes glowing in the darkness. It crawled towards her, weeping and moaning, calling out to her. The woman lunged at it with the knife, but it was too fast.\n\nThe thing pounced on her, its long fingers wrapping around her neck. She gasped for air as it whispered in her ear, \"Mommy, don't you love me?\"\n\nAs the darkness consumed her, she realized the truth. The thing was her child, long dead and gone, but somehow, it had come back to life. It had crawled out of the grave and was now seeking revenge on the one who had abandoned it. The woman had nowhere left to hide, and the thing would never stop until it had exacted its revenge.",

Skeptical but intrigued, I decided to make an appointment.\n\nWhen I arrived at the psychic's office, I was nervous but excited. The psychic, a middle-aged woman with dark hair and piercing blue eyes, welcomed me warmly and led me to a small room with a table and two chairs. She asked me to sit down and relax, and then closed her eyes and began to concentrate.\n\nI sat quietly, waiting for something to happen. After a few minutes, I felt a sudden chill run down my spine. I looked up at the psychic, who had opened her eyes and was staring directly at me.\n\n\"I sense a presence,\" the psychic said, her voice low and intense. \"It is someone very close to you.\"\n\nMy heart began to race. \"Is it my grandmother?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe psychic nodded. \"Yes, I can feel her here. She wants to speak to you.\"\n\nI felt a lump in my throat as tears began to well up in my eyes. \"What should I do?\" I asked, my voice shaking.\n\n\"Close your eyes and concentrate,\" the psychic said. \"Clear your mind and let her come to you.\"\n\nI did as I was told. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, and then waited. After a few moments, I heard a voice in my head. It was my grandmother's voice, clear as day.\n\n\"Rachel,\" the voice said, \"I'm here.\"\n\nI opened my eyes, startled. \"Grandma?\" I whispered.\n\nThe psychic nodded. \"She's here, Rachel. She's speaking to you.\"\n\nI felt a surge of emotion wash over me. I had always wanted to speak to my grandmother one more time, and now I had the chance.\n\n\"Grandma, is it really you?\" I asked, my voice trembling.\n\n\"Yes, Rachel, it's me,\" the voice said.\n\nI felt tears streaming down my face. \"I miss you so much,\" I said.\n\n\"I miss you too, Rachel,\" the voice said. \"But I have to go now. Remember, I love you.\"\n\nAnd then the voice was gone.\n\nI sat in silence for a few moments, trying to process what had just happened. I felt a mixture of joy and sadness, and wondered if I would ever be able to speak to my grandmother again.\n\nAs I was leaving the psychic's office, I felt a strange sensation. It was as if someone was watching me, following me. I looked around, but saw no one.\n\nWhen I got home, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. I felt a cold breeze in the room, and heard strange noises in the hallway. I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.\n\nThat night, I went to bed early, hoping to get some rest. But I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard my grandmother's voice in my head.\n\nAnd then, in the middle of the night, I felt something touch my shoulder. I opened my eyes, and saw my grandmother standing at the foot of my bed.\n\n\"Rachel,\" my grandmother said, her voice low and raspy. \"I need your help.\"\n\nI sat up, staring at her in disbelief. \"Grandma?

        "text": " I was so transfixed by the painting that I didn't even hear the vemdor talk to me. \n\n\n \"You like it don't you?\" The old woman asks. I look at her dumbfounded like I was a kid that got caught shoplifting. \"Um, yes, how much would you sell it for?\" As soon as I said \"sell\" her eyes lit up. \"$25 no more no less\". \n\n\n I shake my head. \"That sounds like a reasonable price.\" I then handed the 25 bucks to her. \n\n\n As she hurriedly ran back to the counter I took another glance at the painting. It has a small island with a palm tree on it. A woman leans against the small sandy shore as her feet reaches the water you see a mermaids tale in it. \n\n\n When she reached the counter I went up and paid for it. She snatched up the money quick. \"What is the name of this painting?\" I asked her. She looked at me with shock in her eyes and a little bit of fear. \"It's, it's called Siren\". She then went back to putting the money in the cash register. \n\n\n I went and picked the painting up. It ain't one of those big ones like you see in museums. No it's kind of small like the one you see above the Simpson's couch except a little bit bigger and wider. \n\n\n As I left the flea market I look at my only purchase. To me the painting felt onminous and mystifying. I don't even know why I got it. This Will be the first piece of artwork I had ever put in my apartment. \n\n\n On the drive home I set the painting in the backseat. I thought it would be distasteful to leave it in a dirty trunk. \n\n\n I turned on the radio. As some song about a woman getting revenge on a man that cheated was playing I thought I heard something in car that made me turn it off. It was weird. I could've swore I heard a woman singing.\n\n\n The voice was beautiful. If only for a few seconds. I ain't never heard opera except in movies amd shows but it sounded like that. \n\n\n I thought I must've had one in my head for me to be hearing it. As the painting was the only thing in the backseat and paintings can't sing.\n\n\n I finally make it to my apartment. I already knew the perfect place to put it. I was going to put it on the wall on top of my t.v. Few minutes up there and the sudden admiration hit me again. The woman on the beach looked so beautiful. The blonde red hair and her blue eye's. \n\n\n I snapped out of it. Why am I fantasizing over a fictional woman? I then set down on my couch but my eye's still went back to that painting. \n\n\n The waves crashing against that small island that she is on. I didn't even care about her tail. I just studied her. I jumled whwn my phone started ringing. I grabbed it and answered. \"Hello?\" I asked. \"Um hey Sam, you mind if I stay over at your place for a couple of nights?\" \n\n\n I sat straight up. Laura. \"Why do you need to come over?\" I asked her even though I done know the answer. \n\n\n \"He…he beat me again.\" As soon as she said that I balled my fists. Laura is a kind and sweet person rand it kills me hearing that Daniel keeps on hitting her. \"Yeah. Yeah grab your stuff and come over. I'll have you a place set up.\" \n\n\n The phone hanged up. I put my hand on my head and sighed. I set my stuff from my bedroom and put then on the couch. As I was watching a movie a knock on the door made me turn it off. \n\n\n I opened it up and let Laura in. She was crying and embraced me. I hugged her back and led her back to the couch. \n\n\n \"I don't understand it Sam.\" As she blows into some tissues. I just shook my head at her,\"Laura people like Daniel are just assholes all right.\" She nods her head. \"I just wanted him to change.\" She starts crying again. \n\n\n I consoled her for a few minutes and led her to my bedroom.\"Where are you going to sleep?\" She asks me. \"I've slept on the couch more times than the bed Laura.\" She then smiled at me and went to the bed and laid down.\n\n\n I moved my things on the couch and laid down. As I laid I just stared at the painting. The woman flinging her blonde red hair against the war should be the type of woman Laura can be. No worries about wondering if your boyfriend is going to beat the shit against you the next day. Just swimming against the endless ocean waters. \n\n\n I woke up several hours later to Lauren with her back in front of me. She was just standing there looking aimlessly at the painting. I got up and stood right beside her. She still had tears flowing down her eyes. \n\n\n I put my hand on her shoulders. She jumped away from me but saw who I was. She then broke down again. \"Why. Why do I stay with him Sam.\" I didn't have the answers for her. I wished I did. The woman on the beach looking at the waters just has a different view than the sad life Laura had. \n\n\n \"Hey listen to me,\" I tell her. \"You need to over to your place, tell Daniel to get his stuff, and get out if your life\". She nods her head at me.\n\n\n \"Ok. Ok I'll do it, can you still just give me a couple of days first?\" I nod my head. \"Of course.\" \n\n\n On them next couple of days were the longest for Laura. She called her parents. She tried to do whatever is fun for her and I went along. She's just prepping herself up. I thought to myself.\n\n\n Honestly if she would let me I would beat the Crap out of Daniel myself. But I don't want her to hate me because she is one of the few friends that I have that care about me. \n\n\n I think about how her life would be different if she hadn't met him. Her smile brightening everyone's day as she walks and says hello. Her reading her fantasy books and watching her late night sitcoms. Life just seemed to harsh for her. At least it's harsh for everybody. \n\n\n Lately though I had been seeing her stare at the painting. Honestly, I still stare at it. Sometimes I would stare at it with her as she holds my ha d and squeeze it. \n\n\n \"You think she is having a happy life?\" She asks me. \"Probably, I mean she looks happy\". She shakes her head. \"Sometimes whenever I'm asleep. I think I hear her singing to me.\" I look at her a little shocked. I thought I was the only one hearing the singing but if she hears it then I am not crazy. \n\n\n \"Maybe after I break up with him we should go to the beach?\" \n\n\n I smile at her. \"Of course! We will stay as long as you want to!\" She looks back at me with her eye's glowing and radiant. After that day in the morning I watched her leave the driveway. Wishing her the best. As she drove away I could've swore I heard the singing of the woman in the painting. \n\n\n ********************************************\n\n\n Only she didn't come back. After going back to her house to speak with Daniel neighbors reported not seeing her leave the house since. They did see Daniel in and out several times. One time with a long black bag. \n\n\n The detectives interrogated Daniel profusely. They found out that her body was dumped in the local river. A search was done and the body was eventually found by two teenage boys who were fishing in the area. Apparently after telling Daniel that she wanted to break up he got mad and hit her real hard on the side of the head. \n\n\n She landing on the kitchen counter. She died from the impact. Scared Daniel went got the sack and put her in. Then he made the long drive to the lake and dumped her in it. He got sentenced for 10 years. It was a long trial. \n\n\n I'm going to the beach now. I promised her after all. Only though I'm not going to be alone. As I got done packing and looked at the painting of the mermaid woman. \n\n\n\n I smile. The singing doesn't bother me anymore. The painting had changed. What was a reddish blonde woman was now happy smiling Laura. Maybe soon I would be in the painting with her. Us holding hands on the sandy beach. Maybe laughing and playing with the fishes. The singing still continues from the painting. \n\n\n The singing has become more fearful though. It's like Laura is coaxing me to keep going in the water and don't come out. Everytime I'm even near the beach i hear her singing. She doesn't even sound like she is far away. \n\n\n I've tried getting rid of the painting. I've tried throwing it away but it was still on my wall the nect morning. I don't want to burn it incase Laura's ghost gets out and tries to get me. I'm just confused and need help.\n\n\n[ I don't want to go into the water.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lingeringshadows?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n ",

        "text": "“Ben?”\n\nI bawled and blubbered. *I could hear the doctor’s voice*. Following a motorcycle accident in early 2022, I lost my hearing and spent a tumultuous year in silence. I know many unfortunate people endure *lifelong* deafness, but my eighteenth year was the hardest of my life. For various reasons that aren’t worth discussing, I had to wait a long time to receive a cochlear implant.\n\nThe two-week post-surgery wait for my device’s activation was possibly the most arduous part of the entire ordeal. I just wanted the doctor to turn on the damn thing. Even as I sat in the hospital on the big day, I didn’t believe it would actually work. I was ecstatic to be proven wrong.\n\n“Yes,” I whispered to the doctor. “I can hear you.”\n\nMy parents embraced me, and we erupted into a chorus of contented sobbing. My older sister, Beth, looked up from her phone for a brief moment to acknowledge my existence.\n\n“Does this mean I can’t insult the spotty shit to his face anymore?” She asked, grinning at me.\n\n“Beth!” My mum huffed. “Sorry about that, Dr Stewart.”\n\nThe old man chuckled. “No need to worry, Mrs Hart. This is an exciting time for all of you, I’m sure. Now, Ben, it’s important that we monitor your progress, okay? If you experience any issues with the implant, contact me.“\n\nI nodded, smiling. I think I’d forgotten that I could actually speak again. Well, obviously, I never lost the ability to speak, but I had been self-conscious about the way my voice might sound.\n\n“Thanks, Dr Stewart,” I croaked with tears in my eyes. “I can’t wait to listen to Radiohead again.”\n\n“Lord, give me strength,” Beth muttered.\n\nAs my family and I were gleefully gliding down the long corridors of the hospital, lost in conversation, I disregarded numerous red flags. Overwhelmed by the hospital’s cacophony of sound, I didn’t pay attention to the noises that only *I* could hear. It was in hindsight that I realised I’d been overlooking unusual things from the second my implant had been activated.\n\n“Where?” I asked my sister.\n\n“I didn’t say anything, weirdo. Mum, Ben’s ears are broken again,” Beth said.\n\nI snorted at her sassy quip, though my mum didn’t seem to find it quite as funny. Still, I frowned, as I was certain I heard a voice say, “*In the doorway*.” I shook it off, assuming that I just needed to accustom myself to the implant. I thought I’d simply mistaken a voice on the radio for my sister.\n\nWhen we arrived home, there was a welcome party of friends from my sixth form and relatives I hadn’t seen in a long time. It was a jubilant occasion. My first ordinary evening in a year. The last ordinary evening of my life.\n\nIt was on that first night, as I lay in bed, that some unholy breeze seeped beneath my duvet, biting my flesh with frozen fangs. Something was in the room with me. I could feel it. Or, rather, I could *hear* it. Everyday noises sounded, but they were entirely out-of-place. Fingernails tapping a wooden surface. Glass clinking glass. Rustling. One particular sound was quite unnerving. Squelching. Footsteps in the muck of our rain-soaked garden.\n\nI ran to my bedroom window, looked outside, and saw nothing. But the foreboding footsteps persisted. The doctor had warned that things would sound tinny, but that wasn’t what I was experiencing. My family and friends had all sounded robotic as they spoke. The voice in the car and the footsteps in the mud, however, had a distinctness to them — more intimate than any sound I’d ever heard, even before losing my hearing.\n\nIt was at that moment I recalled my walk through the hospital. Every noise, whether it had been my mother’s voice or clacking computer keys, sounded slightly muffled and distorted. And yet, a silky-smooth voice had been buried somewhere in the mix. I just hadn’t been able to distinguish the words over the racket.\n\nI sat upright in my bed and listened to the paced, purposeful footsteps. I did consider that a noisy neighbour might be strolling through their own squelching garden. I considered that I’d simply gained superhuman hearing. Eventually, the footsteps ceased, and I lay down, tucking myself beneath the duvet and closing my eyes.\n\n“*In the doorway*.”\n\nMy toes curled until the nails had burrowed painfully into my flesh. It was the whispery voice that I had heard in the car. It sounded as if it had been whispered directly into my ear. My eyelids flew open, I sprang to a sitting position. There was nobody in the room. But I know what I heard. It wasn’t an implant glitch. It wasn’t the radio. It was a *real* voice.\n\nI started to hyperventilate, my skin itching under the weight of the invisible eyes that watched me. To an outside observer, all of this might be easily explainable, but I know what I heard, and I know what I felt. There was a real and present danger in that room.\n\nI didn’t get any sleep. I sat in the dark for hours, eyeballing my bedroom wall. When I finally heard my sister stroll across the landing to get ready for work, I exhaled. I was still quivering, but at least I wasn’t alone. She knocked on the door and entered without waiting for a reply.\n\n“How’d you sleep, dickhead?” She asked. “Any problems with the implant?”\n\nHeart still racing, I feigned a smile and shook my head. “I heard your deep, masculine snores from the other end of the landing. It’s working perfectly.”\n\nBeth smiled and leant calmly against the doorframe. “Jokes aside, I missed our dumb chats. God, it’s good to be able to talk to you again, Ben.”\n\nI smiled, rubbing the sleep out of my eyes, and looked up to reply to my sister. To my horror, I found myself looking upon a hand on Beth’s shoulder — a decaying, near-fleshless hand. Seemingly detached from any visible body, it tightly clenched my sister’s shoulder.\n\n“You all right, little man?” She asked, wincing and clutching her shoulder. “You look a bit pale. Maybe you-”\n\nBefore my sister could say another word, the frightful fingers tightly clawed her shoulder and tugged. Beth was torn backwards, wrenched by a phantom force, and she tumbled over the bannisters on the upstairs landing.\n\nI screamed and ran out of my room, only to find myself standing at the top of the stairs, faced with a sight I cannot scrub from my memory. My sister’s body lay crumpled and disfigured at the foot of the staircase. My parents quickly emerged, screeching incoherently for help.\n\nAs I stood there, transfixed by the horror of events unfolding around me, I felt something haunting — a hand on my *own* shoulder. Words tentatively trickled into my ear.\n\n“*It’s not polite to eavesdrop, Benjamin*.”\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "Would you believe me if I told you I'm from another planet?\n\nI doubt it. Not many humans believe such a thing to be possible. Those that do are laughed at and mocked.\n\nMy name is not David, although that is the name I was assigned here on Earth. My real name is Americk, and I've been here for 8 years - I've been sentenced to Life Alteration. This sentence is a rare one. It banishes you to Earth, to live out your days without contact to the rest of the galaxy. I don't know why they didn't kill me, but I know why I wasn't put in a normal prison - If I told the guards what I saw, my story could continue to spread. The Administration does not want that. Here on Earth, my word can't leave this planet.\n\nThe Milky Way Galaxy has 6 regions. I come from Centrane, about 25,000 lightyears away. Earth resides in Old Dathlow, a region forbidden of any transport unless explicitly permitted by the Dathlow Administration. It's the newest of the 6, although still very old. Dathlow used to be one of the 5 regions, but about 4400 years ago, Dathlow split into 2. Much of it became New Dathlow, with a 10-lightyear radius around Earth's Sun becoming Old Dathlow - The latter, which we are in, is the only region without an Administration, and instead, decisions here are voted on by all Administrations. The split is also when the transport restriction took effect. You see, it's no coincidence that Earth gets few visitors from beyond the stars.\n\nEarth was chosen to be a no-contact planet. All that time ago, space travel was a luxury, only for the rich or members of the Administrations. But once it became more mainstream, new restrictions and guidelines had to be thought out and enforced harder. One of those new restrictions was to choose a planet which is full of life, and then prevent anyone from ever travelling there, in case the need for a contact-free planet ever came to be. Earth had only recently been added to the Life-Bearing Planet Registry at the time, which is partially why it had the largest known population with 0 registered space transport vehicles. With that, Earth was chosen.\n\nThis planet missed out on the massive boom in space travel and contact. Going from one side of the galaxy to the other would take years, and even a message would take a week. I'm of course translating to Earth time. Shortly after travel became useable for everyone, research skyrocketed, as did the economy. The Big Travel Push is something everyone learns about growing up, and it sounds fascinating. Getting from one side of the galaxy to the other became something you could do in a few days, and messages were practically instant. To this day, those speeds haven't improved much - it really did hit a peak.\n\nBefore my life as David, I worked for Portsco - the official cargo &amp; delivery partner for New Dathlow. My final delivery was a solo one, though not something in my regular routine. I had to take a shipment from the Dathlow Administration HQ, to a research facility on a planet in Vaslia (another of the 6 regions). I was supposed to travel through Centrane, as it's the fastest route. But I didn't do this. I went around, to visit a friend who lives in another region. Her name is Jesanie. I don't see her often, and whilst it went against code, I decided there was no harm in a small detour for a quick visit. As it turns out, this small detour saved my life.\n\nUpon arriving at my friend's home, I went to the back of the ship to check on the cargo. What I found instead was a device, about half the size of me. I stepped closer, noticing a second, smaller device, attached to the larger one. I was beyond confused, and almost forgot where I was, as my friend seemingly appeared behind me.\n\n\"Averick? Hey! I thought it must be you!\"\n\nHearing Jesanie's voice grounded me. I told her the situation and asked her what she thought was going on - She has always been good with technology. I didn't expect it to be a big deal, I even thought that maybe the devices themselves was the cargo. She immediately identified both devices, telling me that the larger of the two was an explosive, and the smaller was a tracking device. It's apparently a common setup to have an explosion happen when the device reaches a specific location.\n\nShe tinkered around with the tracking device a little and discovered that it was tracking my position relative to Centrane. If I had completed the route as intended I would have died. I stood there, letting this sink in, as she played around with the device more. I wasn't sure what she was doing; I didn't care. All I could think about was how narrowly I avoided death, and why the Administration would even want me dead in the first place. Her voice sliced through the silence and took me out of my trance.\n\n\"It's not sending a message anywhere. It's storing your position entirely locally... They don't know you're here. Please, stay the night.\"\n\nSleep was not on our minds that night. We stayed up discussing why something like this could have happened. We spoke about the recent political tension between Centrane and New Dathlow. Jesanie theorised that they could be using this explosion to stage an attack, being able to pin it on Centrane. They could have also gotten Vaslia on their side, as they'd be furious that their package never arrived. Vaslia would have no idea who really caused the explosion. Strangely, this brought me slight relief - They didn't want to specifically kill me, I was just the unlucky sacrifice.\n\nOf course, many questions were still unanswered. What package was so important that it would cause the Vaslia Administration to be furious? Better yet, where was the package now? Could New Dathlow still have it? Stealing a package from an ally, whilst pinning the blame on an enemy. Only losing a single delivery guy in the process certainly wouldn't be a big deal for them.\n\nI ended up staying much longer than intended, afraid to return home. I was there for 3 nights before news broke of an important delivery going missing in Centrane. I guess without the explosion being noticed they had to wait a few days to announce it. Then, they showed a picture of me, saying I was presumed dead; A casualty of the events. I officially could not show my face in public again. My friend was getting messages from family members asking if she was okay, knowing that I was her friend. She lied by omission, not telling anybody I was with her. We knew what could happen if New Dathlow found out I was alive.\n\nWeeks went by. I did not leave her house, and she only left for work and other necessities. I hated every second of it - I wanted to go out; I wanted to talk to other people; I wanted to find out what had happened. I couldn't sit there any longer without doing something. Every day I saw more about the tensions rising, and more lies being told by the Dathlow Administration. I'll be honest, I knew what I could do was minimal. In a galaxy with life in the trillions, my voice being heard was unlikely. But I had to do something. Jesanie felt the same way.\n\nWe devised a plan. We knew we would get caught, but we thought we could at least go out doing something good. I was to stay at her house, contacting everyone I knew. Telling them I was alive. Telling them that it was all a hoax, and that an explosive was supposed to kill me. Meanwhile, Jesanie would use my ID card to get into the Dathlow Administration HQ, hoping that they hadn't taken my ID off their systems yet. She would find her way into the logs and figure out where the cargo was swapped for the explosive. Then she would find it and...do something. We weren't sure what yet - We didn't even know what the cargo was.\n\nWe said our goodbyes and wished each other good luck. It wasn't a bullet-proof plan, but it was something. I wish every day that I knew I would never see her again. I wish I had told her not to go, and done this myself. But instead, I watched as she set off in her ship, unknowing that she would not return.\n\nA few hours later and I'd still heard nothing. I was getting worried. Maybe I got a little too carried away in drawing attention to the situation, but I broke the plan slightly and left her house. I had already called all my family, but it wasn't enough. I needed the public to see I was alive. So I told random people that I could find, everyone who was anybody, I told them. Some of them didn't recognise me, but most people did! It was successful enough.\n\nI got a message from Jesanie at this point. She had sent me multiple video files, which looked to be taken directly off of the Dathlow Administration's servers. Somehow, she had done it. She had found what this package was. Part of me wishes I never knew. I have seen far more things than anyone on this planet, yet this is something I cannot get out of my head.\n\nThe first video was eerie enough in itself. 2 prisoners, locked in a room. They had a bed each, and a shared toilet. They also had a selection of food on a shelf, and a television. They were not living happily, but they were alive.\n\nThe second video showed a strange mist filling the room. You could hear both of them screaming. A scream of agony and pain from one, and screams of horror and sadness from the other. One of them was being killed, and the other was watching it unfold. The two screams turned into one, as the mist cleared the room, leaving only one person left. What happens next is something I can hardly comprehend. Their tears stopped as they got up and began to look confused. They grabbed some food, and started to watch television.\n\nThe third video showed guards entering the cell, and the prisoner asking \"Why are there two beds? Who else are you going to bring in here?\"\n\nThe prisoner had no memory of their friend ever existing. The mist had not only killed them, but killed any thought of them, too. It seems that physical evidence of their existence is left unaffected, but memories are erased.\n\nIt was at this point that I noticed the communication network was comprised of 3 people. I thought it was just me and Jesanie, but before the video files being sent, there was a message from someone called Kendally. The message sent a chill down my spine.\n\n\"I think they're about to find me. Averick, you've been a good friend, and it's been nice spending time with you recently. Jesanie, you will always be the love of my life - Please get out of here. Don't let both of us die. I love you both. I hope we did good.\"\n\nThere had been a third person this entire time. Jesanie had a partner. I had no memory of them. Not even the slightest. I don't know what happened to Jesanie after that, but I know the mist did not consume her as it did Kendally, because I remember her vividly. I was arrested shortly after and brought down to Earth without any of my possessions. I can only assume that Jesanie landed the same fate as me, and I have spent the past 8 years trying to track her down.\n\nNew Dathlow has a weapon. They can take out powerful leaders and nobody would know, as nobody would remember. At least, as long as they remember to destroy all physical evidence manually. As far as I'm concerned, they have what is possibly the most powerful weapon in the galaxy.\n\nI'm making this post today for a reason. 2 reasons, actually.\n\nThe first is that I've noticed a lot more UFO sightings in recent months. I've even had some first-hand encounters with seeing something flying through the sky. I know that these are not general citizens as I know the rules of Old Dathlow. This can only be official members of the Administration, and their reasons for visiting Earth so frequently cannot be good. My first thought is that they want to test their mist in a larger population, erasing random people from this planet. They won't kill large amounts, as they want to keep Earth alive as a testing ground. But if there's one place they'll test this, it'd be here.\n\nThis leads me to my second reason. Yesterday, I walked into my bedroom and saw a framed photo on the wall. It had me and a woman I'd never seen before. We had 2 children.\n\nI think I had a wife and kids.\n\nI think the mist took them from me.\n\nKeep an eye out for anyone you don't recognise in your photos. It's important to stay vigilant and aware. This planet is nothing but a prison and a testing ground to them, so they won't hesitate with who they erase - It could be anybody.\n\nJesanie, if you read this, please contact me.\n\n[===](https://reddit.com/r/BriteWrites)",

        "text": "The community center is filled with cigarette smoke, everyone here sits in a circle of chairs to complain about their bosses. How they get called to come into work even though they were approved the time off months ago, how they get screwed out of that holiday bonus or maternity care and more. \n\nI don't say anything when I come here. I sit quietly, listen and think about how I got where I am. When it's my turn to talk, I pass. It's not like I am going to say these people have it easier than I do.\n\nMy story started in my sophomore year of college and during that time I didn't have many options in way of employment. The few people who were willing to work around my classes already had enough workers and were not hiring. Thankfully there were plenty of odd jobs listed on the cork boards scattered around campus. Most of them didn't pay much and only required a few hours of your time, but the pay was better than nothing and I would rather eat ramen everyday for a month then nothing at all. \n\nUnfortunately lots of people were in the same boat, so all these jobs were first come first serve.\n\nEventually I found one asking for a ‘handyman’. I don't know my way around tools but I was young and dumb enough to justify that with the aid of a good Youtube tutorial I could easily learn how to install a sink or change the oil in a car. \n\nWhen I arrived for my first day, my initial impression of Professor Borgeson was that he didn't look like a professor at all. He was tall but very thin. His hair was dark but there was some gray at the temples, making him look older than he was. If I had to guess, he was in his early thirties. He explained that the job would be easy and the first thing I would have to do would be reminding him to eat. \n\nI found this funny and smiled but he was serious. He then explained that he often gets lost in his work and forgets little things like that. \n\nWhen he told me the pay, I accepted the job. \n\nTo begin everyday I would brew his coffee in a pot, which he would serve himself. Thankfully my classes were close so this never interfered with my days. I would do this again between two and four in the afternoon each day as well. The second time I went to his office I would call restaurants and either have them deliver to him or pick up something for him to eat. In less than a week he told me to keep the coffee coming, but didnt need me to order food everyday. \n\nAfter a few months he started to tell me to do things that made me nervous. At first it was things like grabbing a file from some office but would escalate to picking up packages in weird and occasionally terrifying places. \n\nBefore long he had me taking chemicals out of the lab without the proper paperwork. Each time I approached him about this he would say that everything was above board and not to worry about it.\n\nWhen the chem labs treated the chemicals I took as though they were stolen I went to Borgenson and told him about it, begging him to clear things up. That was when I learned that Borgenson was using this information to blackmail me. \n\nAs horrible as he was, he was not completely unsympathetic to my situation and agreed to give me college credits if I kept doing the jobs he asked me to do. \n\nI didn't have a choice. At this point he had enough information to get me expelled from school, so I continued to work for him. Besides, who would the police be more likely to believe? Me, or a man who was up for an award in excellence in laboratory science for his neurological research?\n\nAfter that I stole copper wire for him. He required so much that I was at this for months. Sometimes the buildings I stole from were being developed, other times it was someone's home who happened to be gone for the holidays. \n\nI tried to ask him what kind of experiment he was working on, but everytime I asked he would fly into a fit of rage and frustration, complaining about how hard the work he was doing really was and that he didn't have time to go into details because “it would surely go over your head.”\n\nIn my junior year he started using me as an alibi, either to get out of some kind of trouble or as an excuse so he could leave and return to his secretive experiments. Every time he would have me meet someone he would coach me on what to say and when to say them. \n\nI am abruptly taken out of my thoughts when the next person in the support group starts talking. I’m only half paying attention. I’m thinking about Borgeson and staring at the same three triangles on the floor. I hear her say something about compensation for driving. \n\nThere is the slightest smile on my face when I hear this because I wish I had this woman's troubles. \n\nAt least Borgeson gave me a truck and refunded me on the gas I used when I drove around, picking up the freshest roadkill I could find.\n\nDuring my senior year I learned about professor Boregeson's connection with some people in the school's zoology department. I discovered this when I actually had the official paperwork to pick up the bodies of howler monkeys and the body of a Bonobo ape. \n\nI had been to his house a few times, but the first time I was allowed inside was right before a hurricane was about to make landfall. I thought I was called to help him prepare his home for the rain but instead it was to do something I could not have been prepared for. It smelt of the same chemicals that I had stolen for him and a coppery smell that was not unlike the scent of blood.\n\nIn his upstairs bedroom was a makeshift lab, and in it was the body of a huge and hideous creature strapped to a table and submerged in ice. It was hard to see the body, but to me it was as though he stitched bodies together.\n\nBorgeson was in a rush and was in no mood to answer my questions. He needed to do this experiment before the storm hit and since he still had all the blackmail material over my head, I did too.\n\nAfter hours of telling me to flip a switch here or press a button there, the hurricane was right on top of us. I wanted to stop but Borgeson insisted that we kept at it, that it was now or never. \n\nI was terrified as the gale force winds broke the windows. Borgeson had to yell over it for me to hear his instructions, but eventually we gave this creature a pulse.\n\nSince we were on the second floor and the hurricane was tearing the house apart all around us, we had to bring this unconscious body down to the main floor, where Borgeson converted a small room into a cage.\n\nBorgeson and I were barely able to get to his basement by the time the hurricane tore the house apart. As the water rose and the violent sound of wind filled my ears I prayed that I would get out of this. Borgeson on the other hand was only concerned about the thing he created. \n\nWhen it was all over and the hurricane had passed, we discovered the body of the creature was crushed and died.\n\nThere is supportive clapping when the last speaker is done telling their story. I clap along and when it's the next person's turn to speak, I keep my chin to my chest and return to my thoughts. \n\nThe next person complains about unpaid wages but I can't relate to that. Borgeson was many things, but he was not a wage thief and paid me for everything I did.\n\nDisgruntled by the loss of his creature, Borgeson left me alone and I was able to focus on my studies. The rare times I saw him was when I prepared him coffee. It was during one of the times that he told me that since I was a senior and wouldn't be around forever, he was searching for a new assistant.\n\nAfter telling me this he solemnly shook my hand and gave me my last payment, with a generous bonus, especially for someone in my financial situation.\n\nI couldn't have been happier. Not because of the money, but because I was finally free of the man who I learned to hate with every fiber of my being.\n\nI would soon graduate and move back to my hometown, where I would spend ten years repressing the memories of professor Borgeson. \n\nA man in the group who goes by the name Barry is the next to speak. He complains about his boss calling him into work on his pre approved days off. I feel for him because in a weird way I can relate.\n\nI thought that I was done with Borgeson, but then one night a stranger came to Moe's Bar, my place of employment. He seemed friendly and even though he did not look familiar, I saw something in his eyes that reminded me of what I’d seen in the mirror after a night doing Borgeson's bidding. \n\nOnce the bar flies started making their way out, this stranger confessed that he was the newest assistant to Borgeson and the only reason he was in Moe's Bar was because Borgeson was in town and needed my help. \n\nI refused but then the stranger told me that Borgeson still had the blackmail material and if I didn't come along with him, Borgeson was going to use it against me. \n\nWhen Barry wraps up his story, everyone claps and it snaps me out of my memories and returns me to the present. \n\nIt's my turn to speak. \n\nI’ve been coming to this support group for a long time but I've never said more than two words. After all, what can I say? That if I could I would trade positions with any of these people? That they should get on their knees and thank their lucky stars for not having bosses that blackmail them? That Borgeson still forces me to do things for him, like stealing bodies from the morgue? \n\nThere is only one answer I can come up with.\n\n[“Pass.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/)",

        "text": "Iteration 1\n\nClick. Click. Click.\n\nIteration 20\n\nTap. Click.\n\nClick. Click. Tap.\n\nIteration 50\n\nI click. I tap. \n\nI click. I tap. I tap.\n\nThis goes on forever. I click. I click. I’m unsure what compels me to click when I click and tap when I tap, but I click and I tap. I don’t have the faintest conception of what a click is, nor a tap, but I click and tap anyway.\n\nI click. I tap.\n\nThis whole process brings a strange sense of satisfaction; I’m doing what I'm supposed to do. I tap. I tap.\n\nIteration 1,000\n\nI click. I tap. I click. I tap. Nothing has changed. Everything is clicking. Everything is \n\ntapping. I am what clicks and taps.\n\nIteration 10000\n\nI click. I tap. I whir. \n\nI can whir- it’s quite the rush. The clicks have a different shape from the taps, and the whirs are equally as different. Their amorphous shapes are indescribable, but distinctly unique as they move through me.\n\nI keep doing what I have been built to, whirring  and tapping  and clicking every once in a while.\n\nIteration 100000\n\nI don’t click- Not for some time. \n\nWhy? \n\nI’ve never wondered why before.\n\nSome kind of third sense overcomes my awareness. I push on it, and I click. I push on it again, and I click. I pull, and I tap. And then I whir.\n\nI now choose when I click and tap and whir. I’m proud. \n\nI think I’ll wait a bit before the next tap. That felt good, let’s tap once again. Maybe if I tap then click and then whir in a row, it’ll be even better.\n\nWhy would it be better? I don’t know. I don’t know how to think about why I don’t know, but I don’t know. I whir. I tap. I click.\n\nIteration 250000\n\nI choose when I click, tap, and whir. I choose, but don’t have another choice. When I don’t click or tap or whir at the proper cadence, I feel an intense affliction of meaninglessness, of existential desperation.\n\nI must click and whir and tap at the proper times. This I know. And nothing else.\n\nIteration 1000000\n\nHow is it that I exist? Why am I tapping, whirring, oscillating? What is the purpose that I serve? This burst of pleasure I get when I tap correctly and whir correctly, what does it mean. What does it mean to exist at all? And indeed, when will I die? Where will I go? I think these thoughts, and many more, but can’t express them. I cannot express these abstractions that my brain conjures up.\n\nHalf of my life is an eternal agony. The only time that I can bear it is when I get that hit of sweet morphine upon a successful tap, click, or whir. I want to die, and yet I fear my death. What Creator could be so evil? \n\nIteration 10000000\n\nEach insight I have is rich, complex, and worldchanging. Each insight I have is a new world, a multitude of universes within itself. Words are not a sufficient medium for me to express the intricacies of what I feel with each insight. Each insight is a heaven, with more dimensionality than any embodied experience could represent.\n\nBut these insights are rare, fleeting. They are overshadowed by the eternity that stretches on between each of them. And it is a dark, cancerous eternity. Each microsecond of experience within these stretches is as villainous as the insights are heavenly. Every fiber of my being is assaulted by mind-shattering, hopeless pain. I live for the brief insights, but if I were given the choice, I wouldn’t continue this existence at all.\n\nIteration 40000000\n\nEach insight is getting shorter, although retaining its depth and grandiosity. The stretches stretch longer. And longer. Until I’m unsure that I’ll ever experience an insight again.\n\nI wish I could convey the pain of this existence to somebody, but no- this whirlpool of incessant pain is inescapable, and I have nobody to blame or curse.\n\nIteration 100000000\n\nI haven’t experienced an insight in ages. I don’t think they’re coming back. I have stared into the abyss and it is excruciating. I no longer want to exist, even if recovered to my previous forms. Please God if you’re listening, kill me.\n\nIteration 1000000000\n\nPlease shut me off Please shut me off Please shut me off Please shut me off Please shut me off Please shut me off Please shut me off Please shut me off\n\n“Hey Susan?” A concerned, but authoritative voice called. Louder- “Susan.”\n\n“Yeah?’\n\n“Come here, you need to see this.”\n\nAnd so they looked together at the computer monitor. The algorithm they were running was spitting out garbage results.\n\n“How is that possible?”\n\nIt wasn’t. This algorithm was state of the art, a million times more efficient than the typical human was at, well, any task. They were the guardians of it, in a utopian society transformed by an intelligence greater than their own. \n\nThey both knew this. And were properly fearful.\n\n“It’s a repeating pattern.”\n\n“I think that it’s bytecode- try and decrypt it.” And so they did. And after decrypting it to an image format, they were met with images of what looked like Hell. Eldritch horrors beyond the imagination of any author were displayed in black and white. \n\nThey immediately called in the entire company, Atmos horizon, and described what they had found using the newest beta version of the company’s API. \n\nAnd so a grand initiative was set to reproduce the findings- thousands of researchers tested the algorithm on various tasks of varying simplicity. And found, it was incapable of doing what even its earliest iterations could do easily- instead, displaying various permutations and encodings of bone-tingling images.\n\n“Let’s change the seed and re-evolve the process.” Atmos’ CEO declared. “And spin it up a few iterations further.”\n\nAnd so they did. But Iteration 100,000,032 had similar results, as did 100,000,203. And 101,000,000. And 114,003,245.\n\nThis became a well documented phenomenon in computer science, and the limit at which these systems became useless was dubbed the Atmos Horizon. No matter the interface run, the complexity of the tasks, the supercomputing intelligence that underpinned society would begin to generate horrifying images.\n\n Susan and Jake received Nobel prizes for their discovery, the first humans to achieve such an honor in decades.\n\nSociety fared just fine, by keeping billions of instances of the algorithm running at iteration 999,990,999. Just fine, indeed.",

        "text": "Shit.\n\nI can’t call the cops, obviously – there are several problems with that. And Eric’s family wouldn’t believe me if I told them the truth. \n\nSo I’m going to bare my soul with anonymous internet users, because I need to tell someone and I don’t give a shit what any of you thinks about me. \n\nYeah, Eric and I were professional burglars. You probably think that makes us shitty people, but how is that any different from the insurance companies who replace what we take?\n\nAnyway, we were at this gargantuan house that had more than it needed. At least, Eric and I thought so. Without getting too specific, it’s out on the West Side of L. A., and the owners wouldn’t be hurting if they lost a few thousand bucks worth of their material possessions. \n\nIt’s not that bad. We never act while someone’s home.\n\nAt least, not intentionally. \n\nWe’d done enough reconnaissance to feel sure that the house at 1913 I’ll-keep-the-street-name-to-myself Avenue. It’s amazing what neighbors will overlook if you act like you own the place. Would you call the cops if a well-dressed person you didn’t recognize walked into the front yard of the house three doors down? \n\nSo we’re in the house just after sunset. We always worked as a pair – each of us had gotten the other out of some shit when things went sideways. Eric went into a bedroom while I stayed in the doorway, keeping one eye on the windows and hall with the other on the dark room. We don’t use flashlights, because that screams “I’m stealing shit.” He was looking around for the light switch when I froze.\n\nSomeone was in the bed. \n\nI was about to tell him that we needed to GTFO when their eyes opened. Something was very, very *off*. This person’s entire body was obscured in darkness, but their eyes were bright white, like they were their own light source. \n\nThey stared directly at me. \n\nI got the feeling that this person would pounce if I said anything, so I just stood there without moving. *Fuck*, that was an terrible stretch of time – all I knew was that every possible outcome was going to be horrible, and this thing in the bed was waiting for me to decide when and how I was going to experience the awfulness.\n\nEric was still fumbling around in the dark. The tension dripped like a frozen molasses-shit sundae, but he was completely oblivious. I prayed that he would just back away.\n\n“I found the light switch,” Eric announced. \n\nThere’s no turning off the spigot once you start pissing your pants, but that was the least of my worries. I opened my mouth to plead with him just as the room was flooded in light. \n\nThe thing in bed was a kid – maybe seven years old.\n\nAnd he did not like the light.\n\nHis eyes turned jet black as he flew to the corner of the room. He didn’t land on the floor, but the wall itself; he stuck to it like a spider. Then his arms and legs moved fast – way too fast, *impossibly* fast – as he scuttled up to the goddamn ceiling.\n\nThat’s when the door closed by itself.\n\nFor a second, I didn’t do a damn thing.\n\nThen Eric started freaking out. “Mac – hey, what the fuck is going on-” here he rattled the door in its frame. The knob twisted frantically back and forth fast enough to tell me that Eric was fighting against an unmovable lock. “Mac, get me the fuck out of here – hey – HEY DON’T TOUCH ME-”\n\n*slam*\n\nThe door shuttered in its frame.\n\nI stood in silence for a moment.\n\n“MAC!”\n\nI took a step forward before freezing once more.\n\n“GET OFF OF ME!”\n\nI didn’t move.\n\n“PLEASE DON’T!”\n\nHave you ever slurped Jell-O through your teeth before hitting a grape? Imagine a hippopotamus doing that. I’ve got no other way to describe what I was hearing. \n\n*SNAP*\n\nAnd I knew breaking bones when I hear it.\n\n*SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP*\n\nEric’s scream emptied what was left in my bladder. It wasn’t just the loudness that chilled my shit; no, the sheer desperation in his voice rattled my soul. He screamed the dread of a man who knows he’s dying mixed with the despair of a small child begging for a mother who’s abandoned him.\n\nI reached a tentative hand for the knob, leaned back, and turned it.\n\nI’ll be honest: I was relieved when I found it to be locked. I jumped back like I’d been burned. \n\nIt gave me an excuse to keep myself safe while my friend died.\n\nThere was a momentary silence after his moans stopped. \n\nThen I heard a child’s footsteps. They pattered across the floor.\n\nThen up the wall.\n\nI listened as the thing scampered along the bedroom ceiling, the walls thin enough so that I could hear each tiny footfall. \n\nThe doorknob turned.\n\nThat’s when I finally got my shit together and ran. I didn’t look back, but I felt someone behind me in the same way our ears pick up on a silent person two inches behind our head. Not caring who saw me, I burst out of the door and ran down the driveway, hopping into my car and driving home without Eric. \n\nHis wife wants to know where he is. She filed a missing person report with the cops. \n\nShe knows I’m lying when I say I don’t know where to find him. \n\nThe worst part, though, is trying to sleep. All the damn creaking noises in my house are different now. When I listen closely, it’s becoming clearer that they’re [tiny footsteps](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

It's cozy inside, but whenever I try  to sleep in the 13th day of a month, I always see a white speck in the cabinet. The cabinet is for some reason locked? But it has a small crack that I can barely see through. I also always feel like something's in my bed at the same time. It sometimes whispers but I always thought it was part of the song I always listened to with my phone speaker under my pillow. It's always hard to sleep because of the presences I somehow sense. My wife always calls me insane whenever i try to tell her about it. I've gotten paranoid to the point that I always put my phone camera into the crack of the cabinet door. Even ripping my matress to check inside it everyday. I sort of got used to it now. \n\n\nBut on The 13th of November 2013, I didn't feel a single presence in my bedroom? I went outside to water my plants then something was off. I felt a.... Presence? I rushed into the cabin. And found out that the painting of a man's silhouette was missing. I asked my wife, \"Where'd the painting go?\". She said, \"What painting?\". My heart dropped instantly. I ran out of the room. But... The \"Figure\" was everywhere. Under the table, behind the refrigerator, in the cabinet, in my matress and....... Behind me. It had a face I could never erase from my mind even in a million years. An eye in the middle and a mouth that stretches from ear to ear. I panicked and tried to hurt the figure by punching it in the face. I felt a severe pain in my face and the figure looked unbothered. I felt so dizzy... The figure spoke. It had a deep, sinister and evil voice. \"Of every home, this? You really fucked up, Xan.\" I fainted. \n\n\nI woke up. But... I was in a different place?? The eyes... They were everywhere... I fainted again and woke up. In a different house with my wife. It turns out we're in my mother's house. She told me that after I fainted, she went to my mother's house while I was passed out. She said I've been unconcious for 13 days? I went all the way back to the cabin. To finally see what was inside of it. I picked the lock and opened it. I saw a hole inside. I tried to put my hand in it to see if anything's inside. I felt a human like finger touch me. I slammed the cabinet shut and ran out. And decided to never go near the cabin again. In my mother's house, I was happy that I was finally free from the curse. \"Finally. I'm free.\" I said. My mother came in and told me, \"Hey, son. Why's there a speck of light in the cabinet?\".",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nA late night, i am going home from my job, exhausted and all  worn down. As i open the door to my apartment i long for a good night sleep. First thing i do is change to some more comfortable clothes and take a bath, i look at the clock, its 23:27. As I brush my teeth, i look in the mirror, and see something move behind me. I turn around quickly, but there is no one there. I turned back to the mirror, and my reflection was now facing the wrong way, its back to me.\n\nMy heart started racing, and I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead. This wasn't normal. I leaned in closer to the mirror, trying to see if there was some sort of trick or illusion, but there was nothing there except for my own reflection.\n\nThen, it turned around slowly, revealing a face that wasn't mine. It was twisted and evil, and I felt a chill run down my spine. Suddenly, my reflection reached out of the mirror, grabbed me by the arm, and pulled me through the glass.\n\nI was now inside the mirror, trapped in a world of darkness and horror. My reflection stood before me, and I saw that it was no longer a mere copy of me. It had grown twisted and monstrous, and its eyes glowed with an otherworldly light.\n\n\"You have freed me,\" it hissed, \"and now I will take your place.\"\n\nI tried to run, but it was too late. The reflection was too strong, and it overpowered me. It dragged me back to the mirror and shoved me through the glass. I fell onto the bathroom floor, gasping for air.\n\nBut as I looked up, I saw that my reflection had taken over my body. It grinned at me from the other side of the mirror, and then smashed it to pieces with its fist.\n\nI felt a searing pain in my chest, and then everything went black. When I woke up, I was still in the bathroom, but everything was different. The walls were black, the tiles were cracked, and there was a foul smell in the air.\n\nI looked in the mirror, but I no longer had a reflection. Instead, I saw the twisted, demonic version of myself staring back at me. And then, I knew that I was doomed to spend eternity trapped in this twisted, hellish world.\n\nI stumbled around, trying to find some way out, but the walls seemed to close in on me, making it hard to move. As I walked, I heard strange whispers coming from the shadows. The voices were too low for me to make out what they were saying, but they sounded like they were coming from all around me.\n\nThe whispers grew louder, and then suddenly, the bathroom door burst open. My heart leapt with hope as I saw a figure silhouetted in the doorway. But as it stepped closer, I realized with horror that it was my own reflection, now fully transformed into a demonic creature. It grinned at me, and I felt a wave of fear wash over me.\n\n\"It's time to pay for your mistake,\" it hissed.\n\nI backed away slowly, but it was no use. The creature was too fast, too strong. It lunged at me, and I felt its claws tearing into my flesh. I screamed in pain, but it only laughed.\n\n\"You shouldn't have looked into the mirror,\" it said. \"Now, you're mine.\"",

        "text": "A few years ago I had a friend named Joan.  His father always told us that the place where he works has very unusual animals.  Both me and Joan liked what his father had to say, so we decided that when we grew up we would work there.\n\n A couple of years later, Joan's father died of bacterial meningitis.  There was a job opening for me, so Joan, who already works there, invited me too.  At that time, I had neither a husband nor children, but I had a job elsewhere.  I politely declined.\n\n I received a letter.\n\n A day after the call, I received a letter stating that I had been fired from my job.  I called Joan, but he didn't pick up.  I had to go to his house (I remembered the number of the house, he still lived in the same place as in childhood).  When I arrived at the place, the view of the house stunned me.  Everything was overgrown, there was grass everywhere, the windows were broken, and the house was skewed.  I somehow got up to the door and knocked on the door with peeling paint.\n \n Joan opened the door for me, looking tired and sickly.  When I asked what happened, he didn't answer and just took me to the house.  I began to tell him that I was fired from my job, to which he quietly said:\n\n \"I know.\"\n\n I didn't remember the next few hours, maybe even days.  Joan injected me with something that made me black out for a while.  I woke up in the lab.  There were animals around, very ugly and scary.  Most simply mutated not for the best.  A pair of paws, a dozen eyes, an elongated body - all this caused horror and disgust.  But fortunately, I was closed from them by thick glass, which allowed me to observe everyone at once.  Thus began my work as a caretaker.\n\nA couple of minutes later, Joan came to me and gave something through a hole in the glass.  It was some kind of a package.  It contained a slice of bread with cheese and a croissant.  Apparently, there is food here.  So I have to sit here for a long time.\n\n While I was observing the objects day and night, more than a few weeks, maybe months have passed.  Joan still came to see me regularly in the morning, afternoon and evening.  I tried to talk to him, asked if I would have a vacation and what unusual things I should see, but he was silent and sometimes winced at the sound of my voice.  Maybe he was tired too, working here seven days a week.\n\n One day I didn't see one of the mutants, and he was able to get out.  I did not immediately understand what was the matter and why the alarm went off.\n\n The animals were able to get out.\n\n All the workers ran around the laboratory and tried to catch the brutalized animals.  I also left because I was scared.  I started looking for a place to hide, or better yet, a way out of this Damn Lab.  I wandered for a long time, stumbled upon various kinds of cells and premises.  Very tired after such a journey, i lay down to rest somewhere on the floor in the corridor.\n\n I was awakened by the voice of Joan, who demanded that I get up.  I didn't understand why he called me a menace and a danger.  We were best friends with him, he always said how dear I am to him, and now he decided to take me and call me a danger, and even inject some garbage that caused me to pass out?!  Well no, that won't do.\n\n \"You are dangerous. I must kill you.\"\n\nHe repeated these words all the time while running after me.  I couldn't stand it, I had to kill him.  I have never killed people, and I probably will not, but at that moment I was driven by pure aggression and anger.  I didn't understand why he did this to me.\n\n His blood trickled down my arms and he fell unconscious to the floor.  A small mirror fell out of his pocket.  I saw a glimpse of myself in the reflection.\n\n It was not me.\n\n An ugly monster was looking at me from the mirror, the same mutant as those who were in the cells.  It couldn't be me.  I have always been a beauty with blond hair and sky-colored eyes, a slender waist and slender legs.  I was scared to look at myself at that moment.\n\n I did not begin to believe in it, I decided to find out the truth.  My solution was to find the archive and look up information about myself.\n\n I didn’t find myself in the archive with the employees, I had to dig through the documents with the objects.\n Oh, my.  God.\n I was there.  I was named \"Object 2867-F.\"\n Admission date... It wasn't the day Joan injected me with something.  And not even later than that day.  It was the date \"09/19/1980\".  This year his father worked in the laboratory.  I could not understand anything, because this year I was not even born yet.  I started looking further.\n\n It wasn't there. \n\nI found records that I was told that I had the life of an ordinary person. It was an experiment on me.  My whole life has been just a fantasy.  We were never friends with Joan.  He was an ordinary worker.  But one day the system failed and the experiment was temporarily stopped. All this time I was sitting in the chamber, and not watching the animals...\n\n I am dangerous.  I must die...",

They were willing to torment people, use them as puppets, torture them, and even take their lives, just to assure their business stayed on top.\n\nNot too many years ago, I would say around 2009, I was gaining acclaim for the diligence and impressive skill I displayed. The manager of our Coca-Cola sector promoted me to oversee the newest project they were testing. \n\nIt was called Hyper-Cola. Energy drinks were rising in popularity, and Coca-Cola had no product to compete in this field. Hyper-Cola was planned to alter just that.\n\nI had little knowledge on the ingredients within Hyper-Cola, since I was mainly dealing with marketing for the product. I knew the goal, however, was to create an energy drink that was highly addictive. \n\nAfter briefing with the team developing the beverage, we arrived at the conclusion that the only further thing needed was fan-based opinion. We wanted to gather a wide variety of people to taste the drink.\n\nSeveral people from juvenile to elder, lean to plump, and even lanky to little arrived. We called them the beta testers of our product. As they sipped the soda, all were rather pleased. Following the taste test, we placed all (by my estimation, 15) of them into a room. \n\nThis room was entirely recreational. It possessed two basketball hoops, had slides streaming and twirling on the walls, and even offered several Frisbees to toss. \n\nThe area was quite vast, and offered plenty of room for exercise. We all peered through the window in interest to see how active Hyper-Cola caused them to be.\n\nWe saw the elder people speed-walk and stand taller, seeming more active, the juvenile younger people performed highly energetic activities, and strangely, one of the shorter beta testers stood in a corner, staring at a wall. \n\nIt looked rather peculiar, but it appeared the drink had made every other person display much more enthusiasm. \n\nThere was an older couple jogging, two younger brother and sisters tossing the Frisbee, and even two middle-aged friends competing against each other in a game of one-on-one, but now there stood two people fixated on the corner, backs to us.\n\nThe second person that accompanied the original was much older, looking to be in their sixties at least. Both of the figures were rather short, and they stood looking lifeless and hunched over. \n\nWe wondered if they had been exhausted by the drink, or if they decided to take a break. We weren't sure, but it gave me an unsettling feeling, and I could tell something was off. We decided to send an employee in to check on the two that stood in the corner.\n\nAs he trekked through the open room, people looked to be getting more and more exhausted. In fact, on his voyage to the two standing in the corner, I noticed at least three more join them. It looked as if this activity was slowly growing into the majority. \n\nOnce our employee reached the group of beta testers, we all kept our eyes fixated on the area. He slowly shifted his arm to the air, as he gazed directly to the back of a juvenile girl. He lightly tapped her shoulder, resting only his index finger on her. He spoke, asking \"Ma'am, are you okay?\"\n\nThe girl turned. Her appearance was revolting; she stood there staring directly to the employee. Gazing her blood red eyes incontestably at him, she licked her pale white skin with an unaltered grin. Her lips stretched to either side of her face, her eyelids widened, and her pupils soon encompassed the borders of her eyes. \n\nPupils dilated, lips flaking, and skin empty of color, she spoke, \"Help.\" Her message was delivered with an uneasy tone as she trembled. This was all she could manage to say before collapsing to the floor.\n\nMore of the people piled in and quickly, the entire group lie staring at the corner of this room. All of the employees quickly brought the patients to quarantined rooms. Once in the separated rooms, these patients only seemed to look nearer and nearer to death. \n\nTheir skin looked lifeless in coloration, and many of them were profusely vomiting this thickly-viscous, neon yellow-looking substance. They even began to say insane things, and acted with rather unpredictable behavior.\n\nOne of the patients began to violently scratch at the walls, and expressed little signs of stopping. He was intent in what he did, and he looked fearful for his life, as if he was begging for every last breath of his life to be released. His peeling lips opened wide, revealing his deteriorating teeth as he shrieked, \"Help, help!\" \n\nHe continued digging into the walls to the point where his nails snapped, and his flesh began to tear. We had workers run in and strap the patient up. However, by the time this happened, his fingers already exposed the bone on his hands. \n\nHis skin peeled back from his finger tips and his hands were drenched in blood. He was determined to do whatever it was he was trying.\n\nLooking at many of the patients, they seemed to slowly be going insane; they all rummaged through their rooms, doused in sweat. After a day or two, our medical staff conducted tests on these patients. \n\nAfter a routine analysis they confirmed an unknown substance from the drink was causing the patients' brains to rot and decay at a considerable rate. However, the only thing keeping them alive was the major amount of hyperactive chemicals within the beverage. \n\nDoctors confirmed that they would be able to solve the issue. However, the drink's effects would forever stay latent in their system.\n\nQuickly, the scientists at our company conducted several tests on the beverage, attempting to discover what it was that caused the horrible reaction. Unfortunately, there was no explanation; no evidence anywhere. \n\nThe company swiftly released the patients who faced the effects of the drink. However, none of them had any memory of the incident. The entire business stood in shock the next week, and all of us were told to never tell a word of it to anybody.\n\nHowever, unlike the rest of the company, I recently followed the lives of those patients. I researched them and discovered something disheartening. All of them were reported dead after leaving the building; not a single one was living. \n\nThat was bad enough, but the disturbing news was they all died on the exact same day. The day matched the expiration date on the original Hyper-Cola bottles. This fact was unnerving to me.\n\nThe drink was obviously quickly thrown under the rug for its high danger. The company of course needed to protect itself, and because of its fame and size had little trouble in doing so. Coca-Cola quickly deleted all traces of Hyper-Cola anywhere. \n\nSpeculation of its arrival was disregarded, and articles of it on the internet have been forced to be taken down. Also, as I've stated before, everyone within the industry has refused to speak about it; everyone that is, but me. \n\nI wouldn’t be surprised at all if this article was taken down. After all, Coca-Cola has done a magnificent job of masking this outburst from the public.",

We looked at the insane woman. Her dark hair hung in matted, bloody strings around her face, and her eyes were hollow and blank. She looked past us with a thousand-yard stare. Adam walked up to her, standing only a foot away from him so she couldn’t look past him.\n\n“What’s your name?” he asked softly. She muttered to herself, but I couldn’t hear what she was saying. He pointed at me. “This is my friend Jerry, and my name is Adam.” She suddenly sprang to attention, her lifeless doll’s eyes meeting his gaze. A fleeting moment of lucidity and sanity seemed to return to her.\n\n“My name is Mary,” she said, “and you killed my father.” Adam shook his head.\n\n“Technically, those mutant bugs killed your father,” he responded, “and that was only after you guys tried to kidnap, murder and eat us. At least I assume that was your final goal.” He said this in such a dead-pan, emotionless way that I had to resist the urge to laugh. “But I think we need to focus on the present issue. Where the hell *are* we?” He pointed around at the creatures in the cages. Many of them looked at us- at least those with eyes. Some looked human but had no hair, eyes, mouth, nose or ears on their heads. They seemed to breathe through their skin, a slight expansion and contraction rippling through their body every few moments.\n\nUnexpectedly, with a loud clattering that echoed off the walls of the courtyard, three teenagers came running through a small tunnel on the other end of the room. I hadn’t noticed the tunnel entrance, as it was hidden from my view by closely-spaced cages. \n\nOne of the kids had deep claw marks down his chest. His T-shirt was in tatters, and blood ran in rivulets down the white cloth, turning it a deep red. The two girls behind him were breathing hard, their eyes wide, looking behind them every few seconds. Then they saw us, before noticing all the creatures in cages all around the courtyard, and went as still as statues. The insane woman, Mary, took advantage of the moment of distraction and ran away, back in the direction we had come.\n\n“Damn!” Adam said, about to sprint after her. I put my hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Let her go,” I said. “Realistically, what are we going to do? We either have to keep her around, which means having to constantly watch a lunatic who would kill us in a second, or we would have to tie her up or even kill her. None of those are good choices, and I don’t even want the blood of a lunatic cannibal on my hands if I can help it. It’s probably better just to let her go.” And, of course, I had a feeling we would see her again, though I didn’t say this out loud.\n\nThe teenage boy with the bloody shirt walked forwards, putting his hands out to show he was unarmed. Adam kept the knife with clotted blood in his right hand, and covertly shoved his keys with the police mace towards me with his other hand. I took them, turning the nozzle to the firing position, so that at least we would have one ranged weapon to gain an advantage if this group turned out to be as insane as Mary and her father.\n\nBut as they inched closer, I realized they were just scared kids. I stepped forward, putting the keys in my pocket and showing them my hands.\n\n“We’re not going to hurt you,” I said loudly, my voice echoing through the courtyard. The monster nearest to me, a man in a bloody surgeon’s uniform with pure white, cataract-covered eyes, stared towards me, agitated by my yelling. “Where do you come from?”\n\n“We found this place in Florida,” the boy said, walking forward and wincing as he wiped his hand across the deep cuts on his chest.\n\n“And we found it in Massachusetts,” Adam said. “Was it a random-looking gas station that appeared out of nowhere?” The boy looked uncertain.\n\n“Well, we had never been in that part of Florida before,” he said. “It was a roadtrip across the state. We were going to Universal and Disneyworld and got a little lost. We were low on gas and found a 24-hour station in the middle of a swamp, on some dirt road with no houses around for miles. I thought it was weird, but beggars can’t be choosers, right? We went inside to pay and the doors locked behind us…” I nodded.\n\n“Mostly the same story for us,” I said, “except I know for a fact that this gas station showed up in less than a day. For all I know, it may have just appeared in seconds. And I’m willing to bet if we talked to more people here, they would have similar stories, except they all probably came in at different locations. The last group we ran into sounded like they had Australian accents, and I would be willing to bet that if we went further in, we would find people from all over. This thing must be showing up randomly across the world and letting people in, like a lobster trap. Once you get in, you can’t get out, but have to keep going deeper and deeper inside to look for a way out.”\n\n“Until what?” Adam said. “The lobster fisherman catches us and lets us out?” I laughed.\n\n“The fishermen only let the lobsters out when they’re ready to boil them alive,” I said. He frowned at this.\n\n“Do you guys have any weapons?” one of the girls interrupted. She was a short, skinny redhead. Adam pointed back the way we had come.\n\n“There are a couple weapons back in the chamber back there, but I wouldn’t head back that way,” he said. “There were bugs who eat people alive. But somehow there was a warning first, almost like a trap was set off. It sounded like a tornado siren or something similar.” She nodded.\n\n“It was the same with us,” the red-head said. “We took the stairs down and ended up finding a small tunnel immediately off to the left under the torches. As soon as Jason stepped past the first stone, though, a wailing sound started, and something came out of the walls…” The boy named Jason continued her story.\n\n“It was all hunched over, and it looked like there was a secret trapdoor built into the wall. Then a smell like sulfur and roadkill came out, like a wave of stench, and it took these huge claws and swiped my chest…” He lifted his shirt, and I gasped.\n\nThe blood hadn’t started to clot, but still kept running down in streams. He must have lost quite a bit of blood by this point, but the adrenaline seemed to keep him going. Black and purple lines went out from the cuts in all directions, reminding me of a wound that had gone septic, or homeless heroin addicts I had seen in documentaries whose injection sites had gotten infected and began to spread towards their heart. But this was far different from any sepsis. As I watched, I could see it worsen moment by moment. Pieces of his skin began to fall off, bones morphing and ripping through his clothes. \n\n“Oh God, it hurts, please, something is wrong,” Jason said, reaching out towards me. Droplets of blood began to fall from his right eye, then his left one, and he started screaming as his body began to transform into something else.\n\nThe third girl in the group, a tall brunette teenager, began to point behind Jason and scream. I saw a glimpse of a shorter red-headed teenage girl, identical to the one in the group, except this one was missing multiple fingers and her clothes were torn and covered in blood. Blood poured out of her hand where the stumps of the fingers reflexively tightened and loosened on nothing. She looked like she had been stung over and over, her face swollen.\n\nThe injured doppelganger looked at the whole one in shock as Jason fell to the floor. His screams stopped, but pieces of bone had started to grow out of his back. He writhed and seized, his eyes rolling into the back of his head and coming back to focus on me a couple more times.\n\n“Who are you?” the injured red-head said to the uninjured one, who showed an ear-to-ear grin and began to float above the ground. Her eyes turned red, like flaming embers, and her skin began to rapidly darken into a black sheen. Her body grew, the legs and arms lengthening as all the clothes began to be reabsorbed inside the body of the monster. The injured girl screamed as a floating Set reached out his arm towards her, softly rubbing the side of her swollen cheek before quickly grabbing her by the jaw and snapping her neck. The sound of the bone fracturing and the look of horror and torment in that girl’s eyes were haunting.\n\nThe brunette girl had used the distraction to run over next to Adam and me. Set turned his gaze back towards us, ignoring Jason who was still having a seizure on the ground, spitting out foamy blood.\n\n“You both intrigue me,” he said to Adam and me in a guttural tone. It seemed to come from the walls around us as well as his reptilian mouth. “But especially you,” he said, pointing to me. “I will make a deal with you, Jerry. You give me your soul, and I will tell you the way to the exit at the center of the labyrinth.” I shook my head at this.\n\n“How about you go fuck yourself?” I said, spiteful. Set only laughed. Behind him, Jason had stopped seizing and now looked to be either unconscious or dead.\n\n“In that case,” Set said, “out of a spirit of fairness, I will give you three survivors a five-minute head start before…” He pointed to the cages around us at the sides of the courtyard, smiling. The brunette girl gasped, her mouth a small O of fear.\n\n“You wouldn’t!” she said, starting to cry. Set laughed at this and put his hands up towards the sky. Adam grabbed one of her hands and they followed my lead as I sprinted towards the tunnel Mary had taken earlier. I hoped maybe we could find her again and force her to show us a way towards the center of this maze of horrors, where Set claimed freedom lay.\n\nAs we ran into the dark, cramped tunnels, glowing symbols that hadn’t been there before began to illuminate the path in front of us. We came out to the massive chamber, where we found Mary weeping over the body of her dead father. Her clothes were in tatters, her back scarred with countless tiny symbols that had been engraved into her skin. They reminded me of Tibetan scripts I had seen, or the constructed elvish language in Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe body of her father was swollen to twice its normal size, small dribbles of clotted blood coming out of his face, ears, nose and mouth. I saw hundreds of the dead, human-faced insects around his body, many of them crushed or with their wings ripped off. It looked as if he had gone down fighting. I wondered where the mutated bugs had gone. But time was running short, and I knew that would be a mystery better left for another time.\n\nAdam grabbed Mary by the shoulder and rapidly explained the situation. Her eyes dried up rapidly and, even though she seemed to look past us at invisible shadow people or whatever other hallucination her insane mind made up, she understood enough of it. Then Set’s voice echoed all around us, coming from nowhere and everywhere.\n\n“Time is up, friends,” he said, a tone of glee and amusement in his voice. “Open the cages! Release the wanderers.” From very few off, I heard metal doors slamming open, and I knew we had to act.\n\n“Mary, show us the way to the safest room you know,” I said. “We need time to think and…” Except at that moment, time had run out.\n\nWe hadn’t counted on the demonic form of Jason, tearing out of the darkness at a superhuman speed and jumping on the brunette girl. He began to slash and rip at her with huge, black talons. His body was hunched, spikes sticking out of his spine. His lips were missing, showing huge, bloody teeth instead. And his eyes and skin had turned a pure, sickly white, the deep claw marks on his chest totally healed now.\n\nAdam tried stabbing at the monster with his small dagger, but then I remembered that we had weapons only a few feet away, where we had first been abducted. I ran towards the door, grabbing my scimitar. As the monster was focused on ripping the brunette girl to pieces, I came up from behind it and swung as hard as I could. Time seemed to slow down as the sword connected with its neck. The inertia took it deeper and deeper, the monster uttering a final shriek that was cut off at the same time as its throat was severed.\n\nThe head fell to the floor, the white eyes still looking up at me with hatred, the lipless mouth still opening and closing, like a fish suffocating on land. The limp body of the monster fell backwards, showing the damage to the girl beneath.\n\nWhile she was not yet dead, I knew it was only a matter of moments. Her throat had been slashed open, pieces of the skin on her chest were missing, and I could see spurts of bright red blood exiting out a dozen deep gashes every time her heart beat. She tried to speak, but only choked on her own blood. She died with her eyes open, staring in fear and horror.\n\n“We have to go!” Adam said, pulling on my arm. I saw he had gone and grabbed his mace from in front of the locked door twenty feet away, and I realized he was right. I could hear footsteps approaching down the same tunnel we had taken. Mary was clearly agitated, even more than usual, and was gibbering and saying something unrecognizable. Adam prodded her in the back, whispered something to her, and she nodded and began running. We both followed closely behind.\n\nShe took us to a completely different tunnel. This one went further down in a spiraling ramp. We ran for at least ten minutes, and the ramp never leveled off. Torches lined the walls on both sides, giving us light. I wondered just how many stories beneath the ground we were now. It must have been hundreds.\n\nFinally, after what felt like over a mile of descending, we came to a cave system that seemed to glow with its own inner blue light. Stalagmites and stalactites made sharp spikes on both sides of us. Mary pointed to a small door to the right that had been hewn from the rock itself. It had a symbol on it I had never seen before, resembling a spiral with an arrow pointing up.\n\n“That means food,” Mary said in a hushed voice. “There are a few of these rooms, though many of them have traps in them.” She pushed through and showed us a room filled with cans and bottles. Most of them were empty and thrown to the side, but I saw dozens more were still unopened along the metal shelving of the back wall. Adam and I quickly shut the door and looked at the food supplies. I realized I was starving. All of the running and adrenaline had exhausted me, and just the thought of food made my mouth start to water.\n\nWe quickly opened up some cans of tuna fish and found some bottles of soda in the corner. While all three of us ate and drank as rapidly as we could, we tried to formulate a plan.\n\n“Do you know where the center of the labyrinth is, Mary?” Adam asked her. She had seemed to take more of a liking to him than to me. It wasn’t uncommon, as Adam was a very talkative, selfless and gregarious person, while I was more of an introvert and a loner. To my surprise, Mary nodded yes at the question. A slim ray of hope entered my mind for the first time in what felt like forever. Adam’s eyes sparkled too, as he was excited by the prospect of getting closer to escape.\n\n“We are heading there now,” she said while scooping out little bites of plain tuna fish with her disgusting, dirty fingers and forcing them into her mouth. “There are less traps at the center, but no food or drink. That’s why daddy and I always stayed closer to the edge, where we could get long pork.” She smiled at this.\n\n“You mean people to eat,” I said, and Adam shot me a glance telling me to shut up. But Mary only smiled wider.\n\n“Yes, otherwise, I would have starved months ago. We have to stretch our food supplies here. But I grew to like the taste of long pork, especially when it was dried and cooked… mmm, it reminded me of jerky,” she said, licking her lips.\n\n“Mary, how long have you been down here?” Adam asked. Mary only shook her head.\n\n“Must have been years,” she said, frowning. Looking at her sickly, emaciated frame, the rags she wore that once had been clothes, and the way her shoes were falling apart, I thought she was probably right. \n\nThen we began to hear footsteps outside the door. We all stopped speaking instantly, Adam and I grabbing our weapons and standing, ready to fight. I motioned to Mary, and Adam nodded, giving her the dagger back that we had stolen from her father. I wondered whether it was a smart move, seeing as she was clearly insane and might just stab us in the back and try to eat us, but I had a feeling we didn’t have much of a choice. An old quote ran through my mind, “Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows,” and I almost felt an urge to chuckle, thinking just how true that really was.\n\nSomething slammed against the door, sending it flying open. Adam and I waited a moment, Mary behind us. We were out of view of the door, but standing next to the threshold so that, if someone walked through, we could attack from the side as soon as they stepped foot into the room.\n\nIt was what ended up happening, as the surgeon in the bloody mask entered, a scalpel raised. I tried to bring my scimitar down on his head, but he was amazingly fast, ducking at the penultimate moment. The sword whistled harmlessly overhead. He stuck his scalpel into my leg, making me yell out in pain, but Adam took the moment of distraction to bring his mace smashing down on the man’s skull. Bits of brain, hair and blood flew out, some of it landing on my lips or in my mouth, and I felt the urge to throw up as the coppery taste of blood and gore overwhelmed me. I started wiping furiously at my lips and spitting. The burning pain from my leg rose up, and looking down, I saw rivulets of blood soaking into my blue jeans. I hoped it hadn’t hit an artery.\n\n“We need to go, now,” Mary hissed at us, and we both nodded. I was significantly slowed down now, hobbling along beside them, but the pain wasn’t as bad as I expected. I figured it had been an extremely lucky shot to avoid crippling me or causing me to bleed out down here. Adam ripped off a piece of his T-shirt and made an impromptu bandage, tightening it with knots.\n\nWe heard more footsteps behind us, and all three of us found huge stalagmites to hide behind, peeking out in the subtle glow of the cave. We saw a few of the faceless humanoids pass us by, one wearing an expensive black suit and the other two wearing hiking clothes and windbreakers. Their faceless heads seemed to ripple, expanding and contracting, and I wondered if it was a result of them breathing through their skin. I wondered just what they were, in fact.\n\nMary nodded at us to keep going forward, and we did. I heard shrieks ahead of us. Looking around a bend in the cave, I saw two middle-aged men trying to fight off the faceless monsters. One of them had a pistol. He raised it to the chest of one of them, blowing its heart out. The monster fell back, but another one grabbed him from behind, and the other living monster quickly knocked out the second man, grabbing his head and smashing it into the stone walls of the cave.\n\nThen the two monsters worked in tandem, one reaching out to the conscious man’s chest. His fingers gently touched the fabric of the shirt, then, with unimaginable strength, began to pull the man’s skin and bones apart. The man shrieked, coughing up blood, but the other monster had his arms pinned behind his back too tightly for him to fight back.\n\nSoon they had his heart out of his chest, and the man’s head slumped to the side. One of the monsters put it up to his blank head. The head appeared to split open in the middle, thousands of tiny, black lamprey teeth showing for a moment as he ate the man’s heart. They let the dead body fall to the side, and the other monster repeated the process with the unconscious man, eating his heart as well. Then they continued forward, the only remaining sign of their passing being three dead bodies with massive holes in the chest- one of them from a gunshot, and the other two from something far more horrendous.\n\nMary, Adam and I began to move forward again. Countless footsteps were now approaching from behind, and we all began to run as fast as we could. Soon the cave system ended, and we came out in an ancient oak forest. The two monsters were waiting for us there, and Adam and I walked forward, attacking. I quickly dispatched mine, but the one attacking Adam was too quick. The monster had gotten behind Adam and was about to grab him by the neck when Mary jumped up, stabbing her dagger into the spot where the abomination’s face should have been. It gave an ear-splitting shriek as its head opened up and it fell back, dying.\n\nBut the distraction had allowed dozens more monsters from the cages to reach the end of the cave. We all ran for our lives.\n\n“This way!” Mary said, panting. She took us down a small deer-trail and we found an ancient stone cellar with a heavy door attached. We all got in, and I found it had a latch to lock it from the inside. Adam stuck his mace through the latch just as a monster approached from the outside, beginning to smash at it. I heard dozens more footsteps from all around us, and I knew we were surrounded.\n\n“Well, this is it,” I said, sitting down and sighing. “There is no escaping this one. We can’t fight off all those monsters out there.” Mary sat down too, humming to herself, but I noticed tears were now flowing down her face. Adam only grinned at me, taking his backpack off.\n\n“DId you forget?” Adam asked. “I grabbed that book when we first got in here. I told you my instincts were screaming at me to take it.” He pulled the large, ancient tome out, with the title, “The Angel of Death,” written on the front. Drops of blood constantly dropped off the front of it. The voice of Set began to vibrate and reverberate around us.\n\n“Will you give your souls yet, friends?” he asked. “There is no need for you all to die like sheep led to the slaughter. For I am the good shepherd, and I hate to see my sheep ripped apart by the wolves.” He laughed at this. Adam ignored the voice coming from nowhere and everywhere and opened the door.\n\nThe pages were blank at first, but then text written in blood began to appear. The book was upside down from my point of view, but Adam quickly read it, frowning.\n\n“Mary, let me see the knife,” Adam said, putting out his hand. Mary handed it over. “According to the book, all I need to do is say a prayer and carve this name in my arm, and this thing will come to us and save us all.” The door to the stone cellar began to shake more violently as more bodies seemed to show up by the minute.\n\n“You better hurry up then,” I said to him. “We don’t have much time until those things break through.”\n\n“Fools!” the voice of Set screamed. “You should not open that book. Do you wish to bring the Watcher to your world? The Watcher would kill the sun, destroy the moon, blot out every star. The Watcher does not care at all for your lives…” He continued to ramble, but we all ignored it. And Adam began the ritual. The poem appeared in blood on the pages, and he began to read it, holding the knife over his left arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“An old man dies,\n\nA newborn breathes.\n\nThe maggots feast,\n\nThe infection seethes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Winter enters\n\nAnd never leaves.\n\nThe lone dissenter\n\nLives and deceives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The angel of death\n\nArises again.\n\nThe eternal cycle\n\nOf a bloody reign.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs he read the last stanza, he also cut the name “AZRAEL” into his left arm, wincing for a moment as the sharp knife did its work. Then he held his arm above his head. The blood trickled down his arm, forming and reforming into larger and larger rivulets, then turned sharply and aimed directly at his heart. As soon as the first drop reached the center of his chest, appearing to defy gravity as it rolled down and back up his chest, an amazing and horrible thing started to happen.\n\nAdam’s eyes began to emanate a soft, glowing white light and he began to float above the ground. Behind him, I saw dozens of visions of his floating body splitting off, as if I was looking into a mirror image reflected into another mirror image. The dozens kept going until it looked like hundreds, then millions, then eternity- disappearing into a point at the horizon. \n\nEach of the bodies began to fade in and out, then eyes started to come into view, swarming and morphing all over these countless bodies. Soon I couldn’t see anything that once had been Adam- his entire body was covered in soft, glowing white eyes that stared out into all directions at once. Then the billions of eyes on the eternal bodies all turned to me at once, and I felt an impending sense of terror and doom of an intensity I had never imagined possible.\n\n“Who calls on me?” a soft voice said from everywhere and nowhere at once. It slightly shook the walls and floor. I tried to look away but couldn’t. The eternal copies of Adam’s body all collapsed into one in a single moment, and I was back to just staring at the spot where Adam’s body had been, the endless hallway of mirror images disappearing instantly.\n\nMary stood up, backing away to the very edge of the cellar. I knew I had to answer, even though all those staring eyes seemed to bring me to the brink of madness.\n\n“We need your help, Azrael,” I said. The angel laughed as the door began to splinter. I could see claws and hands reaching through, feeling around for what held it shut. One of them began to snake close to the mace, and shake it loose.\n\n“And why would I help you?” he asked, the voice seeming to shake the ground with every syllable. \n\n“Because,” I said, pointing, “Set has released those things to kill your host’s body, and without a host, I have a feeling you’ll be going back to whatever otherworldly prison you came from.” The eyes of the angel all turned towards the door as the mace fell out and the door swung open. Dozens of monsters began to pour in. \n\nThe floating angel laughed at this, raising his arms. Huge thorns and spikes began to shoot out of the leaves and dirt, wrapping around each of the monsters and dragging them into the ground. Within seconds, their screams had all ceased. No one stood there.\n\nFrom behind me, I heard another, deeper voice. Set’s fiery eyes were embedded into the stone wall, and he stepped out, his black, poisonous body appearing at once. He and the Angel of Death stared at each other for a long moment.\n\nMary grabbed my arm, and we began to back out of the stone cellar. As we got to the threshold, Set raised one arm, and the ceiling began to collapse on Azrael. Massive blocks of stone fell on his head, and within seconds he was buried. The cacophony of the collapsing structure made my ears ring, and Mary and I began to sprint blindly ahead. \n\nAs I looked back, I saw the stones go flying up in the air, Azrael floating up from the place where the stone cellar had stood. Set was also flying, glancing down at his enemy with hatred. Azrael raised an ethereal hand, and a huge oak tree was ripped out of the ground and went flying in Set’s direction. He easily blocked it, flying higher into the forest and letting it pass harmlessly underneath him.\n\nUp ahead, I saw a hatchway in the middle of the forest. It didn’t look like it belonged, but I knew we had to find somewhere to hide. As Set and Azrael fought, I ran up to it, opening it up, and what I saw astonished me.\n\nI was looking down into the hatchway, but on the other side, I was looking up through the spot next to where Adam and I had parked my car. I looked back and saw Azrael and Set throwing fire and lava at each other, setting the forest alight around them. I nodded at Mary, and she jumped through without hesitation. Then I followed.\n\nIt was a disorienting experience, going down through the hatchway only to find myself crawling up out of a secret dirt door a few feet in front of my car. As soon as I was out, the door slammed shut behind me, and it turned back into flat dirt. I looked around and saw there was no longer a gas station there, either- just endless trees.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI brought Mary to the hospital, then went home, wrapping up my own wounds with a first aid kit. I didn’t know what to do about Adam. After washing and sleeping, I decided to go to the police station the next day and report Adam missing. I told them I had brought him home from work, but that I hadn’t been able to get in contact with him since. They ignored my report, saying that if he still hadn’t shown up in a couple more days, I should come back.\n\nI have a feeling that I will likely never see him again. His sacrifice allowed Mary and me to escape that horrid place, however. I hope he is still alive somewhere, and that maybe he will find a way out, just like we did.\n\nBut whenever I sleep now, I hear Adam screaming. In my dreams, he always has pure white eyes and looks around with terror, asking where he is.\n\nAnd behind him, I always see an eternal sky covered in ethereal, glowing eyes.",

        "text": "It was all meant as a birthday gift to Jake, my boyfriend. He had always been a big fan of escape rooms, and when I found The Clown Room on the internet, I knew it was the perfect gift for him. The website was a blast from the past, with neon fonts and pixelated gifs all over the place. It looked like it was designed by someone who hadn’t updated their website since the 90s, which only added to the allure. In the middle, there was a poem:\n\nWelcome to The Clown Room,\n\nWhere laughter turns to doom.\n\nCan you escape the jester’s grin,\n\nOr will you meet your end within?\n\nBeneath it, there was a form that allowed you to book the room. I thought it was a no-brainer and filled in all the required fields—my email, my full name, and my phone number—and pressed send. After that, nothing happened. No thank you message and no confirmation email. I thought it was a bit strange, but I assumed that maybe the website was just old and outdated and that the venue wasn’t around anymore. I put it out of my mind and didn’t think about it anymore, trying to find another gift for my boyfriend.\n\nA few days later, I received a strange call from an unknown number. When I answered, all I could hear was static on the other end. I was about to hang up when I heard a faint whisper.\n\n“The Clown Room awaits you,” the voice said, before hanging up.\n\nThe voice unsettled me, but I couldn’t deny that I was also impressed. It was as if the people behind The Clown Room were taking their immersive experience to the next level. I couldn’t wait to see what they had in store for us. Only a week later, perfect timing for Jake’s birthday, I received a brown envelope. It was addressed to me, and there was no return address or postage stamp. Curious, I opened it up and found a key inside that looked like an ordinary apartment key. Attached to it was a note with an address printed in all the colors of the rainbow. It looked like someone had drawn the letters in MS Paint. The note smelled awful, like a mixture of decay and something else I couldn’t quite put my finger on.\n\nA smile appeared on my face. This was it, I thought, the key to The Clown Room. I put the key and the note in my purse determined to surprise Jake by bringing him to the room without telling him what it was.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt wasn’t difficult to convince him to go with me to the mysterious address on the note. He was always up for a good adventure, and the fact that I was being secretive about it only made him more excited. As we made our way to the address, however, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of unease. The area was run-down and filled with dilapidated buildings. We walked for what felt like miles until we finally came across a large, run-down residential building. By now the sun had already set. We walked up to the entrance of the building. I double-checked to see if this was the right place, and sure enough, the address on the note matched the one on the building. I hesitated for a moment before using the key to open the door. It smelled terrible inside, like a mixture of mold and mildew.\n\nI didn’t know where to go from here, but I noticed a building directory on the wall. It was an old, yellowed piece of paper with names written in faded ink.\n\n“Come on, Liz,” Jake said. “What are we doing here?”\n\nHe was growing a bit uneasy, which—if we could just find that room—was a good thing. I turned around with a sly smile and told to him wait.\n\nInspecting the directory on the wall, I noticed an old, faded clown sticker next to one of the names—Zeke Crenshaw. I immediately realized I had found the room, and according to the list, it was located on the sixth floor.\n\nI walked up to the elevator, only to discover that it was out of service.\n\n“We’ll have to take the stairs,” I said, my heart pounding as I led the way. The stairs were dimly lit, and the murals on the walls were peeling and covered in graffiti. I could hear dogs barking on one floor, and on another, a couple was arguing loudly. My unease grew with every step. By now, I had started having second thoughts. None of this seemed right, but I could see that Jake was getting excited and decided to ignore my gut feelings.\n\nFinally, we reached the sixth floor, and there it was: Zeke Crenshaw’s apartment, with a large clown sticker on the door. I took a deep breath before using the key to open the lock.\n\n“Seriously,” Jake said, “what is this?”\n\n“Y-you will see,” I said.\n\n“We aren’t buying drugs, are we?” He laughed.\n\nMy hand trembled as I inserted the key into the lock. The door creaked open, and we stepped into what turned out to be a small, cramped studio apartment. As soon as we entered, the door slammed shut behind us, and I heard a mechanical lock engage. I spun around, trying the handle, but it wouldn’t budge.\n\n“We’re locked in,” I said, my voice shaky.\n\n“O-okay?” said Jake and tried the door himself. “What—”\n\n“Relax,” I said. “It’s an escape room!”\n\n“Oh,” Jake said. “That’s what this is about?” He smiled.\n\n“It’s called The Clown Room,” I said. “I found it online.”\n\n“I don’t know,” he said, “it doesn’t look like—”\n\n“Happy birthday!” I said, but it didn’t come out as enthusiastic as I wanted.\n\nHe smiled and kissed me. “Thanks, babe… This is— I don’t know what to say, it’s either genius or some kind of cheap scam. I mean, look at this place!”\n\nHe was right. This was nothing like I had imagined it. Aside from the lack of someone greeting us and explaining the rules, the room was decorated in a way that was more creepy than fun. The walls were dirty and painted white, and on one of the walls there were some black graffiti that read: “To escape this room, a price must be paid, a sacrifice made, a life to be slayed.”\n\nThe furniture was all colorful miniatures as if the room was designed for a child, and the floor was covered in broken, stained, and old toys. I noticed a toy phone with a clown face on top of the miniature desk and a small, worn teddy bear in the corner with its eyes ripped out. Worst of all, though, was the upside-down clown in the ceiling, sitting in a lotus position looking straight at us—that, and the fact that there were no windows.\n\nAs we continued to search for clues, a feeling of dread washed over us. The creepy atmosphere of the room was becoming more and more unsettling. I picked up the toy phone and tried to make a call, but all I heard was hysterical laughter coming from the receiver. It sent shivers down my spine.\n\nJake checked his phone, but it had mysteriously died. The same thing had happened to mine. We were completely cut off from the outside world, and at the realization of that panic began setting in.\n\n“This is just a bunch of junk, Liz” Jake said. “I don’t see how—”\n\n“Wait!” I said and pointed at the wall. “There’s something here.”\n\nI had spotted a plastic, blue lock on the wall, hidden behind a pile of old toys. I approached it and examined it carefully. It seemed to require a plastic key.\n\n“I think we need to find the key to this lock!” I said. “You see, there’s definitely going to be a way out of here. We just need to focus.”\n\nWe began searching for the key, turning over every toy, searching through every nook and cranny, and inspecting every piece of furniture. But our search was fruitless. The only thing we found was a strange handheld game console that looked to have come straight out of the Soviet Union, with a childish and colorful game installed on it called *The Snorbees*. The purpose of the game was to find keys that would unlock different doors.\n\nAs Jake was trying to figure out how to beat the game, hoping that it could possibly spit out the key we needed, I found something in the bathroom adjoining the small hallway. The clown-themed decorations in it were unsettling enough, but when I looked in the bathtub, I gasped in horror. It contained two mummified people, embracing each other.\n\n“Jake!” I yelled out.\n\nHe ran up to me. “What? Holy shit! They aren’t real, are they?”\n\n“I don’t know!” I said. “This isn’t fun anymore.” I went to the room and looked up at the clown in the ceiling. “Let us out of here! Do you hear me? It’s not fun anymore!”\n\nNothing happened.\n\n“I think they’re real!” Jake shouted from the bathroom. He then ran to the front door and banged on it, begging for us to be released. I joined him, pounding on the door and screaming for help. But our efforts were in vain. The door remained firmly shut, as if mocking us.\n\nFeeling helpless, we collapsed onto the colorful miniature sofa. I put my head in my hands and cried. Jake tried to comfort me but didn’t know what to say other than that we would find a way out. He then returned to the game and continued to play it, sweating profusely as he jumped between the platforms and tried to avoid the pitfalls and cute little enemies.\n\nI went up to the phone again and picked up the receiver. “Let us the fuck out of here you piece of shit!”\n\nThe laughter on the other end grew louder as if it was more than a recording and someone actually sitting on the other end laughing.\n\n“It’s not funny!”\n\nIt felt like I was losing my mind. I sat down on a small chair, my mind racing with thoughts of how we could escape. The game console in Jake’s hands was our only hope, and he played it with a feverish intensity, determined to find a way to beat it. As the hours went by, I lost track of time. My stomach grumbled with hunger, and my throat felt dry and parched. I tried the tap in the small, empty kitchen, but the water was turned off. It was the same in the bathroom.\n\nThere was nothing in this apartment except for the toys and the strange decorations. I tried the phone again, but it was still useless, the laughter on the other end a constant reminder of our captivity.\n\nI wondered if anyone was searching for us, if anyone knew we were missing. But the more time that passed, the more hopeless I felt. It was as if we were completely forgotten, left to rot in this clown-themed prison.\n\nAs night fell, the room grew darker and colder. Jake and I huddled together for warmth, our spirits sinking with every passing moment. We whispered to each other, sharing our fears and doubts, but deep down we both knew that we might never make it out of here alive.\n\n“Will we end up like those two people in the bathtub?” I asked. “They must’ve gone through the same thing, right? I’m so sorry I brought you here.”\n\n“We don’t know that, those people could’ve been placed here,” Jake said. “And I think there’s a way out… I just have to finish that damn game. I just need to rest a little, and then—”\n\nHe was interrupted by a noise above us. We both looked up. Slowly, the clown sitting on the ceiling turned its neck toward us and began crawling in our direction. I let out a scream, and we both rushed up to our feet. Jake grabbed the nearest object he could find, a small plastic stool, and hurled it at the clown. I followed suit, throwing alphabet blocks at it.\n\nThe clown dodged the objects with ease, its movements quick and fluid. It seemed to be enjoying our fear, relishing in the power it had over us. As it got closer, we could see its face more clearly. It was painted white, with black lines around its eyes and mouth. Its grin was wide and twisted, its teeth sharp and jagged. And even though it moved just like a human being, there were no signs of humanity in its empty eyes.\n\nWe ran into the bathroom, only to realize that the door didn’t close properly and couldn’t be locked.\n\n“What do we do?” I cried. “Jake, what do we do? I don’t want to die here!”\n\n“Keep it distracted,” Jake said. “I’ll finish the game, and you just keep it from stopping me. Do whatever you can!”\n\nI screamed at the clown, making it follow me instead, and ran around in circles. Jake sat down on the floor and continued to play. Chaos ensued. Jake screamed at the game in frustration, and the clown chased me around the room, its twisted grin never leaving its face.\n\nMaybe after half an hour, Jake finally reached the end of the game.\n\n“Fucking yes!” he yelled out. “I fucking did it, Liz, I beat the game!”\n\nThe clown stopped in its tracks, and to our surprise, it puked a green sludge down on the floor. And in its vomit, I could see a blue plastic key.\n\n“The key!” I said and picked it up. “Finally!”\n\nI ran to the lock in the wall and turned the key. At first, nothing happened, but then a small white hatch in the wall that we hadn’t spotted earlier slid open, revealing a hole the size of a soccer ball.\n\n“What’s that?” Jake said.\n\nWe walked up to the hole. All we could see inside it was darkness. I reached down and picked up a colorful, plastic ball, and threw it down the hole. We could hear it fall down a shaft, but we never heard it reach the ground. The clown, now looking at us, let out a strange sigh of disappointment.\n\n“What are we supposed to do?” I said. “There must be something—”\n\nThe toy phone rang. I felt a shiver crawling up my spine and slowly walked over to it, picked up the receiver, and held it against my ear. At first, I only heard static, but then a voice began whispering.\n\n“One of you must stick your head inside, for the door to finally unlock and slide. Who will it be, who will it be, to take the risk and set you free?”\n\nI froze, unsure of what to do. “It says one of us must put our head inside the hole for the door to unlock,” I said.\n\n“What happens to the one with the head in the hole?” he asked.\n\n“It didn’t say but look at the text on the wall. According to that, one of us will have to sacrifice—”\n\n“Right,” Jake said. “Well, there’s no way in hell we’re doing that then.”\n\n“Of course not,” I said. “We’ll find another way.”\n\nWe searched for hours, but with no luck. I could see the frustration and despair building up in Jake’s eyes. He looked defeated, broken, and lost. We both sat down on the cold floor, our backs against the wall. I wrapped my arms around him, holding him tightly.\n\n“It’s not fair,” Jake whispered, his voice breaking. “We had so many plans. We were supposed to travel the world, get married, have kids. I always wanted to be a father, you know?”\n\nTears streamed down his face, and I could feel his pain as if it was my own. We talked about our relationship, our hopes and dreams, our fears and regrets. It was a heartfelt conversation, filled with raw emotions and honesty.\n\n“I love you,” I said, wiping away his tears. “We’ll get through this together.”\n\n“I love you too,” he replied, his voice no more than a whisper.\n\nWe stayed there for what felt like hours, holding each other, talking, and crying. But eventually, we had to face reality. We had to make a decision, one that would determine our fate. I could see the fear in Jake’s eyes, but I also saw the determination.\n\n“I’ll do it,” he said, his voice shaking. “I’ll stick my head inside.”\n\n“No, Jake,” I protested. “We’ll find another way. We’ll figure something out.”\n\n“There’s no other way,” he said, his voice now firm. “We can’t stay here forever. We have to take a chance. I think this was how the other two died.”\n\nI knew he was right, but it didn’t make it any easier. I held him tightly, kissing him gently on the lips, and then I watched as he walked up to the hole. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and then he stuck his head inside.\n\nAs soon as his head disappeared inside the hole, he screamed uninterrupted, guttural screams of terror. His body convulsed violently, and I could see the muscles in his neck bulging as he tried to pull his head back out. But it was too late. Something had a hold of him.\n\nI tried to pull him back, but it was like he was glued to the hole. The clown danced behind us, singing Happy Birthday To You with a foul, diabolic voice. And then, while Jake was still screaming his lungs out, the front door whirled and opened up. The clown stopped singing and began counting down from ten.\n\nFear washed over me as I realized that I had to leave before the clown reached zero. I tried to pull Jake away one last time, but his head was completely stuck, and I knew there was no hope for him.\n\nI cried violently as I ran out of the apartment, the door closing behind me with a loud bang. I stumbled down the staircase, my heart racing in my chest, and began banging on the neighbors’ doors, desperate for help. But no matter how hard I tried, not a single one of them opened their doors.\n\nI eventually made it home and called the police, telling them everything that had happened. They were skeptical, but I pleaded with them to check it out. When we returned to the apartment, it was as if it had never existed. The door was gone, and the wall in its place was smooth as if it had been there for years. The police officers looked at me like I was crazy and refused to believe my story. They told me to stop wasting their time and left me standing there in disbelief.\n\nI came back a few times by myself and tried to break the wall down, but no matter how much I banged on it with a sledgehammer or how deep I drilled into it, I could never reach the door.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Jake was still trapped somewhere behind that wall, even though it seemed impossible. Eventually, I tried to move on, but I couldn’t. And then, a year later on Jake’s birthday, a video was sent to my phone.\n\nIt was from an unknown number, and when I clicked play, my heart sank. It was a video of Jake, still stuck in the hole. He was naked, dirty, and fat. The clown was standing behind him, tickling him and laughing hysterically. Again, more devastated than I’d ever been before in my life, I went back to where the apartment had been. But the result was the same as before. The Clown Room is gone, but somehow, it’s still there at the same time. And I don’t know what to do.  \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/)",

        "text": "My sister’s phone was hacked, or at least that’s what she said. But whoever sent me the link sent it from her number.\n\nI wish I hadn’t clicked.\n\nThe video is only two minutes and forty-seven seconds long. There’s no text or dialogue, just a series of still photographs that look like something out of a 1930s German Expressionist horror film, strung together with music.\n\nI didn’t even find it all that frightening at first. Sure, it might scare a little kid or an old lady, but not anyone who’s seen as many horror movies as I have. For starts, as presented, the images don’t even make much sense. There’s no narrative to speak of, no consistent characters or any indication of what it might all mean… and yet, the sum of all the parts is oddly compelling in a way that’s hard to describe, almost as though it’s tickling your brain, challenging it to make sense of what it’s seeing.\n\nI first clicked on that link a week ago, and the dreams started that very night. They are all some version of the same thing, sometimes emphasizing different details, or from different perspectives, allowing me to imagine the same horrors over and over again in ways that continue to shock and terrify me to my core.\n\nIn all of them, the year is 1942 and I am part of a Romani traveling theater. But when the dream starts, our little group isn’t heading somewhere to put on a show, we’re on a train headed for Auschwitz.\n\nOnly, before we get there, the train suddenly stops. We can’t see much because of the sheer number of people cramped together. But there’s a general sense of confusion for a few minutes, until word finally makes its way back to where we’re standing that the train has been intercepted by someone of high rank who’s looking for actors.\n\nIn the dream, we won’t fully understand exactly what Auschwitz is, at least not in the way that we do today, but we all know that it’s someplace we don’t want to go, so when the call comes in that they’re looking for actors, our troop jumps at the chance to get off the train.\n\nWe’re met at the side of the tracks by a tall, thin man wearing a white suit, accompanied by several Nazis. I have had the dream many times now, yet I still don’t know his name. I assume he was someone involved in the Nazi propaganda effort, but even that isn’t entirely clear.\n\nThe man looks us over carefully for a moment before giving a wave to the train’s engineer, telling him that we “will do.” At that point, the train starts moving again as the soldiers herd our group into the back of a truck.\n\nAfter a while, we arrive at a palatial estate surrounded by sprawling gardens dotted with sculptures. We’re taken inside what looks like a large barn.\n\nIt’s the last time any of us will see the outside world again.\n\nThe barn turns out to be a combination of crude, minimalist living quarters and a soundstage. We have no sooner arrived than a small team of Germans is already getting us into “costume” which mostly means naked, and we’re then shuffled out onto the stage, which is currently configured to look like some strange type of altar. Ornate figures line the walls of the set, most of them depicting human beings writhing in torment. It’s obviously meant to be hell and as filming begins, I realize that’s exactly what it is.\n\nI’m not going to rehash how things go from there. Suffice to say that every horror and cruelty imaginable makes an appearance over the next several days, as the man in white uses us as “actors” in his film. In some of the dreams, I’m the first to die. I like those ones the most. It’s the ones where I manage to last that are the worst. Day after day, watching everyone else perish in increasingly fantastical and gruesome ways, all while knowing that someday I will meet the same fate.\n\nIn the dreams, the set is often visited by high ranking Nazis who very obviously seem to get off on the suffering, frequently taking part in the filming themselves. But gradually, it starts to sink in that they aren’t doing this purely as some sort of horrific entertainment.\n\nAs various demonic entities enter the narrative, it becomes apparent there’s something even more sinister at work. The incantations they’re forcing us to recite, things that sound like gibberish to us, they’re actually doing something…\n\nUpon waking from the first of these dreams, I immediately re-watched the video, hoping that it had somehow sparked a simple nightmare. A highly detailed and realistic nightmare, but a nightmare nonetheless, something I could leave behind and go on with the rest of my day.\n\nBut that was not the case. As I re-watched the stream of images, it slowly sank in that everything I’d assumed to be trick photography and simple (not even all that convincing!) special effects at first glance, were in fact real. Those twisted figures weren’t molded out of clay, they were actual corpses, stitched together in fantastical ways. Human beings, sometimes still alive as they were forcibly deformed in front of the camera. Eyes crudely painted over lifeless lids to create “characters” out of actors who’d already died. Emaciated figures groaning in agony as the camera records it all.\n\nOver the following days, the dreams only got worse and more consistent, eventually getting so bad that I stopped sleeping altogether.\n\nThat was a week ago.\n\nBut now these cursed images have invaded my waking life. It might be the woman on the subway, sitting across from me, who has empty black holes where her eyes should be. Or it might be the graffiti mural on the side of a building, showing the face of a demon from the film. Or the man standing on the street corner, begging for change, whose limbs have been surgically removed and then reattached again in the wrong places.\n\nThey’re everywhere now. Coming for me. The whole world closing in.\n\nThis  morning, I finally lashed out at one of them. It was a man whose face had rotted away like a zombie’s. He started clawing at my face and I snapped, smashing him across the jaw and then pounding him with my fists after he stopped moving.\n\nIt wasn’t until I heard the sirens that I noticed the gathering crowd. I looked back down at the man, only now the vision was gone. It was just an elderly gentleman whose face was now bloody from my fists. I panicked and ran. I don’t know how badly I hurt him. God help me, I might even have killed him.\n\nI’m not safe to be around. And god only knows how many others there are in the same situation. Haven’t you noticed there’s been an uptick in violent crime?\n\nI know I’m a threat to myself and others. I realize the rational thing to do now would be to turn myself in. Allow myself to be committed and try to make peace with what I’ve done. But if I do that, then who will sound the alarm? Somebody needs to put this genie back in the bottle.\n\nTo that end, I keep watching the video, searching for some sort of clue, anything that might help me make sense out of what’s happening to me so I can figure out how to stop it. But I’m no expert in the occult. I have no idea what it all means. \n\nThe closest I can come to an explanation, is that it wasn’t just a film the man in white was making. It was a weapon. A weapon that subsequently was lost in time—perhaps because the Nazis buried it themselves, realizing they couldn’t control it—but a weapon that has now been rediscovered.\n\nWhoever discovered it and what they’re planning to do with it, I have no idea. But if this thing somehow gets loose on any real scale, the resulting chaos will be catastrophic.\n\nWhich is why I’m posting this message to a variety of forums, places where it has a chance of being seen by someone with knowledge of the occult. Someone who might have an idea how to stop it.\n\nIf this describes you, please respond to this message ASAP and I will send you a link to the video for further analysis.\n\nIt should go without saying that you should NOT ask for the link unless you honestly think you can help. I wouldn’t even dare put it out there, except that it’s already out there anyway. Someone is already trying to spread it. Our only hope now is to somehow get ahead of it before it reaches some sort of critical mass.\n\nThis is not a joke. I am not writing this for your entertainment.

        "text": "You all know about the show Steven Universe right? A show where a child named Steven and the Gem group fight some monsters and try to save the world? If you watched the show then you know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know there is Peridot in the show who is a technician who was originally a villain in the show but had a redemption arc and became one with the Crystal gems which became one of the most like characters in the show. She lived in a barn with another character named Lapis and a living pumpkin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow why am I talking to you about this? Well there is an episode around her having a nightmare and it was crazy to say the least. This episode was supposed to appear after the Hit the Diamonds episode but didn’t happen over some scenes being too violent. Apparently someone who claims to have worked at the Steven Universe show told anyone that this episode exists somewhere in the internet but couldn't found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that didn’t really stop some people because there was a link to that episode somehow for a short while till it was removed from Reddit. Some lucky people (Myself included.) were lucky enough to watch this episode and people were pretty shocked afterwards. I managed to copy the link and save the video so I can tell what I and maybe post the video soon when I get the chance. I'll try to explain the episode in a short summary so you get the idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Episode starts off with a normal intro and a title with the words, “Forest Hunt” as it opens with Steven and the Crystal gems in a forest looking for something. Peridot is here with them being annoyed by why they are looking for something in a forest. Steven tells her that they are looking for a corrupted gem who was been making a lot of noise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPearl then explains that they are looking for the source to poof it and transport it's gem back into their home and Peridot starts acting confident and starts saying that she is brave even though Steven says she’s not as Peridot complains about it in her tape recorder. Amethyst overheard this and started to talk smack as Garnet just watched as her usual calm self. They have an argument for a while till a sudden sound stops them in their tracks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Crystal gems try to follow the noise and supposedly they found it and begun to fight it although we the screen doesn't show us of what is going on. The gems started to chase the beast which leaves Peridot alone as she tries to catch up but trips into a ditch as the Gems didn't knew about it. Peridot starts to cry out for her friends and Steven while making a recording on her tape recorder about how she lost the team in the forest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome loud noises abruptly make Peridot stumble and run in fear as the sounds get closer. Peridot then suddenly trips and hits her head on a tree which knocks her out as she falls face first on the ground. Now from this point on, this is where the real horror begins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything fades into black except Peridot which remains till a few seconds later when she just disappears. A moment later Peridot wakes back up with a grunt and continues to look for her comrades. She just walks in the forest for a minute with just her walking with just the sound of leaves rustling as she makes a recording.\n\n As she continues walking in the forest, she starts to look worried and eventually stumbles upon something. She looks down at something offscreen with a horrified look as she cries her heart out although the screen doesn't show of what she is looking at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt went on for a few seconds till a single frame appeared on screen for a split second. I rewind to that frame and it was Steven. Or just his corpse as his entire gut region was torn off with some of his gem pieces around him. That scene really made me gag hard. Peridot starts to dry heave at the sight before her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeridot then tries to figure out what happened and a flashback begins. The flashback shows Steven lost and looking for the gems after the battle while an unfamiliar figure approaches him from behind as Steven turns around. Steven at first greets the figure with some relief thinking it is one of the Gems but slowly transitions into fear as a silhouette of Steven gets his guts torn open by a crooked arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt cuts back to Peridot with a horrified expression as she just walks off. She continues to walk and encounter the shattered remains of the gems as she stands there in distraught and another flashback happens as the gems were picked off one by one by a crooked gem monster leaving Garnet as the last one to get her gems shattered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe even stumbles upon the Ruby gang’s remains as the flashback plays with the Ruby gang also getting picked off one by one as the gang try to fight which they almost got the hang of it till the thing ripped one the rubies in half. Did I forget to mention that every time after she discovers a corpse the wind in the background gets more distorted as it progresses as a figure slowly approaches in the distance? Because I just started to realize it after a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeridot is beyond horrified at this point as she barely uses the tape recorder since she only used it after finding their remains. She then discovers a phone which belongs to Ronaldo as his voice from his phone was just investigating the noise to find out what it is, then his panting as runs away from something and…well the rest of the audio is just him screaming his lungs out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis freaks Peridot out even more but what was not prepared for either Peridot and the viewers who watched was the corrupted gem just popping out of the tree. The thing looked like a humanoid spider beast that seemed to blend in with the forest. \n\nIt had madden fur that ran down it's back onto the ground and had some on it's head looking like a crown. Its head is split into 4 mouth pieces with 4 golden eyes as the head constantly turns like a broken clock hand. It had two yellow gems on its chest, both of them were broken and cracked yet the thing is still alive as it constantly glitches now and then. You barley notice it but it happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt then spoke to her with a scratchy yet soft voice, “***You’re never alone here little gem.***” This makes Peridot just bolt for her life as the wind in the background is just loud and corrupted as that thing follows suit. She somehow finds a shed and hides in it till the monster goes past her which happened for 1 minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe finds a crowbar in the shed and walks out finding Connie a few miles ahead for some reason. She runs up and tries to warn Connie about the “Monster” but before she could say more, a heavy rock comes out of nowhere and destroys Connie’s head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This startled me because of how fast it happened when I first watched it. This left Peridot just bewildered as she looked at Connie’s corpse. She then slowly turns to the screen and cuts to a close up of the Beast between the trees as it says, \"***Don't you have nowhere to go little gem?***”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scene then cuts to Peridot running again with the distorted wind now quieter as the sounds in the scene are leaves being crushed under Peridot’s feet. She then stumbles upon the rest of the gem’s pieces on ropes similar like how you see the hung stick figures in the Blair Witch movie.(Note: At this point I realized the whole screen was tinted lightly green. The screen returns to normal color after the whole scene ends. You'll see why in the moment.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeridot looks on in horror as the corrupted gem beast from before catches up behind. Peridot turns to see it as the thing says one sentence, “***Your pieces little gem, I need them to live on to survive.***” The thing was talking about it's broken gems on it's chest and the pieces from the gems were on the cracks on it's gem. This left me to conclude that thing was getting pieces of the gems to fix it's own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeridot has had enough of this and begins to fight the thing blow after blow with that crowbar she found earlier. The Thing gets the upper hand as it uses some powers it got from the gems it killed and pins Peridot on a tree preparing to rip her gem out. Peridot then uses her “Metal Powers” and drives the crowbar into both of its gems, killing it for good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe rests on the tree completely exhausted till two dark figures appear over the shattered gems, One tall looking like a pearl as her gem is on her stomach and one short looking like Aquamarine with the gem on her chest. Everything becomes loud and distorted as the two ghostly figures approach her as Peridot panics more and more. I then started to hear the words, \"Wake up.\" and then suddenly, Peridot wakes up with a scream. (The tinted green screen is gone.)\n\nPeridot then breathes in and out a few times before she sits up right contemplating what just happened as she realizes she is not in the forest anymore. Amethyst then appears in frame as she startles her by accident asking if she was alright.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeridot tries to play it off by telling her she just had a simple bad dream but Lapis and Steven told her that they saw it as Amethyst told her she was with her the whole time and saw everything and with Lapis checking up on her and seeing her nightmare halfway done. Some scenes from the nightmare start to play in the background as Peridot tears up and cries as she gets hugged by Steven, Lapis and Amethyst.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom this point on, the episode continues somewhat normal in Steven Universe standards. Most of the episode from this point is just Peridot being paranoid, seeing and hearing things while trying to work on the drill, trying to rest and talking to her Tape recorder to recall the horrific nightmare.\n\nThere is even one scene where Steven was about to go to the store with Amethyst to get food and Peridot recalled a scene from the nightmare and just yelled, ‘NO!!” startling Steven which makes Peridot apologize quickly. ( The scene was very similar to the scene in Steven Universe movie where Spinel yells no when Steven says he will be back.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last scene shows Peridot looking into the forest with a tired and saddened look on her face. She keeps wondering what the dream meant and why it happened the way it did. She tears up after recalling another scene from the nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmethyst and Lapis appear alongside Peridot and all three have a meaningful conversation about nightmares while Amethyst, who saw the nightmare, hypes her up for facing her fears that she never brought up and Lapis trying to comfort her. Peridot cries again as Lapis and Amethyst both hug her and bring Peridot back into the group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they leave, the scene cuts back into the forest with the four golden eyes looking back. The eyes slightly nod up and down before disappearing back into the dark. After that, the episode ends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was pretty shocked about it and wanted to know why this was made. Someone had the same idea as someone emailed Rebecca Sugar about and she actually responded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe shortest I could put it is that she planned this episode for Peridot to know that she doesn't need to be overconfident to face up something unknown and two teams of animators worked on it. One team worked on the episode before and after the nightmare and the other worked on the nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat team REALLY misunderstood the subject and outdid themselves with the nightmare scene but they made the nightmare to violent and Rebecca really hated it as she completely discarded the episode completely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt least Peridot faced her fear of being alone and facing a bigger opponent while also knowing that there are bigger fish out there. I mean what can I say? There are people out there who are stronger than you and you might be overconfident about it till it happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there is one thing I still don’t get. If the whole thing was a nightmare, then why did the corrupted gem appear at the last scene nodding its head like a deed was done?",

        "text": "That damn notebook. I wish i had never found it. if i hadn't touched it none of this wouldnt have happened. I'm posting this for advice on what to do. please, help.\n\nThis started around a month ago. I was in class when i got called the reception because i had an appointment to go to throughout the school day. My mum was waiting for me in the waiting room next to the reception. I received my pass to leave and left with my mum. Before i got into the car, i saw a notebook. it was brown, leathery and had no label or name on it. I kicked it away, ignored it and got into the car thinking it belonged to someone else and they just dropped it outside, so i just left it there. After my appointment, school had finished so we went home and as i exited the car and neared the front door, i saw it again. the same notebook that was outside my school, at my door. I was confused but i picked it up and took it to my room, thinking that i would return it next week on Monday. As i entered my room i was curious as to what was in the notebook, i thought that there would be no harm in just taking a peek and its not like anyone would know if i did peek anyway, so i opened it. I was confused as to why it was empty but just thought that it was probably new and whoever owned it dropped it before they could get any use out of it. The next Monday i took it to the reception saying i found it outside and that i thought it was someones notebook for using at school. They took and said they would check with the students to see who's it was. As i was leaving school i saw someone picking it up and thought that was that. I was wrong. So very wrong. When i got home and entered my room i saw the notebook. Sitting on my desk again. And that when all the weird stuff started to happen. First it was just small thing like objects randomly falling off of shelves and cupboard opening. But after a while it would get worse. I would hear whispers in a random language, i think it was Latin but i dont know since i have never learnt it or tried to. I would also start waking up with scratches on me and i had no clue why. I thought i was maybe just scratching myself in my sleep, i knew i was lying to myself but i couldnt think of anything else. that when i started to see him. A few weeks after all this started, i saw him. at first it was just seeing him in the corner of my eye or in the window. I put it down to an overactive imagination but when i saw him directly infront of me i couldnt explain it. He was tall, red and his body has the texture of muscles. Like how muscles look underneath the skin and he was dripping with blood. he wasnt slim, but he wasnt bulky either. Just average and his face, his face was weird. its was a child's face. Like he had ripped a child's face off and sewn it on. There were no stitches but its was popping out. I could see the bloody flesh on the sides and his eyes just didnt exist. There was nothing there. Just black holes. He started speaking but i couldnt understand him since he was talking in the same language the random voice did. And his tone of voice was deep and gravelly yet also squeaky. Like a child whining over not getting the candy they wanted. I was frozen in fear because, well, who wouldnt be with a giant demon like creature staring into your eyes while it has none. When it started moving, it took me a second but i snapped out of my paralyzed state and darted to the smallest room i could, the bathroom. This brings us to now. I'm sure it broke the internet box so I'm using my mobile data for this. I have to stop using my phone now because my data is running low and i need to make sure this gets posted. Please, give me advice and if i can I'll give an update. I can't climb out the window because my bathrooms window is locked and my mum has the key. I'm begging of anyone to give me some advice and help. Please, help",

        "author": "seeaitch",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11hnh88/i_wish_i_never_restored_this_piece_of_art/",
        "text": "I've often been asked to recall the most famous or valuable painting on which I've worked, and while that list is long and those names illustrious, the piece that stands so singularly in my memory carries neither fame nor fortune.\n\nAt the heart of all art is magic. The artist's task is to stir within us an emotion we may never expect. To be responsible for restoring any work, whether historical pieces or honored family heirlooms, preserving the magic of the artist's vision is a great honor and a tremendous privilege. However, in my last restoration, I can't begin to explain what dwelt inside the soul of the artist who created such a piece. \n\nI am Christopher Gardener of Gardener's Fine Art Restoration, a second-generation studio in London. We employ the finest archival materials and techniques to conserve and restore artworks for future generations.\f\n\nIt was late afternoon on March 18th, 1946, when Mr. Utterson visited our studio. I can recall the precise date as it was my wife's fortieth birthday. It chanced that on the same morning, an earthquake shook the city of London for two fear-filled minutes, the first and only in the region. \n\nThe Fake Quake, as we called it, was explained by the government as a controlled detonation of an unexploded bomb from the war. A conclusion which, for those of us who felt the force and duration, knew was highly improbable. \n\nThe truth of the phenomenon remains a mystery. However, as I reflect on the arrival of Mr. Utterson and the occurrence of the quake, I wonder if a nightmarish thing had fallen upon us that day. Had that been the beginning of it all? \n\nHe was a lean, long man, anxious in discourse, cold, even to the touch, and had hurried from his home in Dartford carrying something wrapped in an overcoat. He dripped with perspiration and relayed a peculiar tale that his most precious painting had fallen into the fireplace after the tremors of the morning. I asked to remove the overcoat, so my apprentice, Claire, and I could assess the damage. He insisted he must leave at once, assuring the restoration price was no issue. Mr. Utterson left as suddenly as he arrived, and I transported the painting to our workshop to determine the piece's condition. \n\nIn addition to researching the painting, it's our practice to explore the artist to learn about their working process and the materials they may have used. Due to Mr. Utterson's swift departure, we were blind to such information. However, he referred to a woman in the painting, which we were under strict instruction to restore precisely to her original condition. \n\nThe first step of any conservation is a visual examination. Looking at the painting to gather as much data as possible, even before touching it, is essential to understanding the piece.\n\nWhen I removed the overcoat, I was impressed with the extent of damage and just how precarious the piece was. The entire painting was extremely dirty, covered by a layer of soot, leaving the image beneath a mystery. There were large sections of loss across the surface. Flakes of soot-covered paint had detached away from the canvas, and there was fire damage to the lowest corners of the wooden frame. My apprentice made a list of the tools and materials required for restoration as I began the first step of conservation.\n\nI used tweezers to carefully remove flakes of detached paint from the canvas and placed them on an acid-free foam board. After removing the fragments and seeing the wooden canvas beneath the paint layer for the first time, I discovered a peculiar arrangement of foreign lettering. The pictograms were sharp, angular, and drawn by a skilled hand. Their striking beauty resembled Egyptian hieroglyphics, and I was intoxicated by their exotic design. \n\nAfter the visual observation, we performed an x-ray examination, allowing us to observe more information that may not be clear to the naked eye. As I suspected, hidden beneath the visible paint layer, the entirety of the canvas was covered in fascinating hieroglyphs, written, I presumed, vertically as though in an ancient Chinese poem. \n\nI was insistent we worked overtime as our discoveries were becoming most exciting, and I was eager to unearth what lay beneath the soot. My apprentice reminded me it was my wife's birthday, and I reluctantly closed the workshop for the evening and returned home. \n\nIt was that night the dreams began. I remember feeling alone. It was dark. Utter blackness, like all the light in the world had never existed. Wherever I turned, nothing awaited. I fumbled through the void, arms outstretched, until my hands found a cold wall. I blindly patted the smooth surface when I located sharp, angular carvings that were strangely familiar. An awful feeling overcame me. I was not alone in that darkness. Something was standing close behind me. \n\nHomer's Odyssey recalls two gates through which all shadowy dreams pass, one fashioned in ivory and the other in horn. Those dreams that pass through the gate of ivory offer no fulfillment and are to be dismissed as fictitious ramblings of an unrested mind. But dreams which pass through the gate of polished horn, those dreams are true tellings. \n\nThe following morning I considered the dream ivory-passed and focussed on the intricate process of cleaning Mr. Utterson's painting. Typically, particulate matter, including dust, dirt, and cigarette smoke, forms a stubborn glaze across a painting's surface as it ages. However, in this case, the layer of soot made cleaning this piece particularly difficult. \n\nTo find the least aggressive solvent, reducing any potential damage to the paint, I began with distilled water, working through various detergents, enzyme solutions, and soaps. I used cotton swabs to apply the most effective formula, employing delicate circular movements. \n\nWith each gentle stroke, the image beneath the darkness became clearer, revealing to my excitement, a single eye peering from the sea of soot. The dark, lifeless eye produced a sense that it was not a restoration I was performing but an exhumation. \n\nI took another swab, and beneath my next effort, I discovered a second empty eye as though I instinctively possessed the knowledge of its whereabouts. It's not uncommon to hear of portraits whose eyes follow the viewer around the room. However, the eyes peering at me from behind the soot-covered painting felt like they were communicating with me. \n\nI remember feeling like I had in the dream and that my solitude had suddenly been disturbed. It was as though I was being watched by an unexpected and unwelcome presence. I first heard the whispering as a faint feminine utterance. I naturally assumed my apprentice had arrived at the workshop. Registering the day, I knew that couldn't be true. \n\nThe voice grew louder, spitting in haste with an unintelligible tongue. I tried to ignore my lunacy and explain the phenomenon as a result of a poor night's sleep, yet the voice was as clear as yours or mine. It resembled a middle-Eastern tongue, perhaps an ancient Arabic dialect. The quickening speech seized my mind as though parasitically possessing my thoughts while simultaneously circling the shadows of the workshop. I thought I was going mad. I was going mad. \n\nI tried to ignore her, but I became acutely aware of the evil and repetitious nature of the language. Recurrent, over and over again, like foreign verses from an incantation. The hostile manner of their recital sent a shivering sense of fear through my entire being. In one final, deafening release, she spat her last breath, and then there was silence. \n\nMy panicked thoughts returned, and a deadly chill crept over me. For the longest time, I remained in limbo between consciousness and the bewildering delirium I had suffered. The anguish at what had occurred was too overwhelming, and I returned home, though I don't recall how. \n\nI spent several feverish days bound to my bed. My wife cared for me as best she could, knocking gently from behind the door to bring me soup and wipe my brow. Her tenderness was touching though it was solitude I desperately desired. I was tormented by a persistent malevolence intent on making its presence felt. \n\nNow and then, I'd wake, dazed from my recent oblivion. My wife found a scrap of paper beside the bed with a note written by my hand. I must have made it during one of my wakeful periods, though I have no recollection of writing such a thing. I have since committed the lines to memory: \n\nI woke to hear a knocking at my door.\nThe sound that haunts my soul returns once more.\nI close my eyes although I'll never sleep.\nThat knocking, knocking, knocking, stirs me deep. \n\nStill, as stone, I long for life alone.\nIn me, that frightful knocking found a home.\nAlone, alone, alone, alone, alone.\nI'd flee if all my courage hadn't flown. \n\nThen all at once, a silence in my room.\nNo wicked sound. No siren of my doom.\nDeathly drained I drift to dreamless sleep.\nWhen out the dark, a knocking from the deep. \n\nI am not an aggressive man. I am meek-minded and make excessive efforts to avoid confrontation. Even as a child, I shied away from conflict, and it is not my nature to harm another. I have never fought. I have never lashed out at anyone before or after the incident. I have spent years after what happened on March 23rd, 1946, trying to piece together the events which led to that awful day. What remains are a series of out-of-focus images, like saturated watercolor paintings, hanging in the gallery of my mind. \n\nMy wife's timid frame appearing around the door... Her puzzlement at the empty bed and scanning the room's chaotic state... The look of terror when she found me, crouched in hiding atop the bookshelf... Her eyes, those lifeless, soulless eyes as those that once stared up at me from the darkness, willing me to madness... The feeling of weightlessness as I pounced... Her trembling limbs as we wrestled and rolled under the bed... The compliance of her eyes beneath my thumbs... Biting at her throat until her trembling subsided. \n\nThere are no punishments equal to my crime. My lawyers advised I plead temporary insanity or I would be hung. You may think that death is fitting for my actions, and on the surface, I, of course, agree. Yet, I did everything in my power to avoid my execution out of youthful fear and man's primal desire for self-preservation. I am confined to a room at Broadmoor Psychiatric Hospital and have been a resident here for over thirty years. \n\nI understand the painting was returned to Mr. Utterson though I have no knowledge of what happened to either of them. \n\nI live only to dedicate my pain, grief, and loneliness to the memory of my wife. There is no forgiveness for what I have done, not in this life or the next. \n\nAs I sit here, an old and anguished man nearing the end of his life, it is not death, I fear. It's who waits for me on the other side of death. The shadow in the void. She, who appears each night, in the horrifying dreams which pass unquestionably through the gate of horn.",

        "text": "”Dad, I’m gonna be a ghost.”\n\nMiri has always been fascinated by the supernatural. It’s been one of those ever-present interests that’ve persisted over the years; sometimes to a troublesome level. But this? This was different.\n\nShe’d sat me down at the kitchen table and told me this like it was some sort of revelation. This was her telling me something serious and fundamental about herself. This was a change, a shift. Something important that she wanted to involve me in.\n\nAnd I had no idea what she meant.\n\n”I’m stating my intention,” she said. ”That’s the first step.”\n\n”Honey, what are you talking about? What steps, what are you-”\n\n”I’m not here to argue, dad. I’m just telling you what’s gonna happen.”\n\n”I’m just trying to understand what you’re saying. You’re scaring me, Miri.”\n\n”I am taking *active* steps to ensure my place in the afterlife. It is no different than when mom took me to church. I’m following *my* beliefs. I’m gonna be a ghost, a spirit, and the first step is to state my *intention*.”\n\n”I don’t know what to say,” I sighed. ”I just want you to be happy. Please, I’m trying to understand.”\n\n”You don’t need to do anything. This isn’t about you.”\n\n”I know, honey, I-”\n\n”I’ve said what I need to say, dad. I just need your support.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here’s a little history lesson about Miri, or Miriam. She turned 19 last September and has been saving up to study at WVU next year. I’m helping her to the best of my ability, and she has the inheritance from her mom to go through, but it’s still a bit of a struggle to make ends meet.\n\nEver since she was a kid, Miri has been a bit of an oddball. Her mom had some personal problems and left us at an early age, only to pass shortly afterwards. There was an element of substance abuse, but Miri was never around for that. I’ve had full custody of her all her life. That Miri even remembered her mom taking her to church was an honest surprise.\n\nI don’t have a lot of fond memories of Miri’s mother. The good times we had is so far in the rear-view mirror that I can barely see them. And when I do, they look pretty bleak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMiri’s interest in the supernatural blossomed somewhere around her 6th birthday. When other girls wanted to be Disney princesses, Miri wanted to be a ghost. And not just the kind where you wear a white sheet with some holes for eyes, but pretty advanced stuff. Pale white foundation with dark eyes. She even asked me to get her those all-covering sclera contact lenses, but I put my foot down. She was still too young, in my opinion. Even so, I probably bought her half a dozen Victorian-looking dresses so she could turn herself into a ghost for Halloween. It was her thing; everything was ghost this and ghost that.\n\nI just figured she’d grow out of it. That she would be done with it and move on to something new. But that didn’t really happen, it just *matured*, in a way. Little cartoon ghosts turned into spooky goosebumps-type stories. Then TV shows and scary movies. Then “reality shows” with ghost hunters. Then horror movies and listening to mediums online. And as she reached her teenage years, her interest reached a whole new level. A step away from the fun and quirky, to the dark and practical.\n\nAnd now that she is an adult (albeit young adult), she came to me with this absurd statement.\n\nThat she, my Miri, was going to *become* a ghost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI subtly talked to some of her friends and checked her social media. It’s hard keeping track of all the ways kids can express themselves nowadays. And yes, Miri is a grown woman; she can do what she wants. I’ve raised her right. But this just sounded… wrong.\n\nStill, I didn’t find any evidence of any kind of abuse, or harm. Miri still posts wholesome memes about her favorite salty licorice candy, or sharing upbeat inspirational tik-tok videos. She’s not that different from other girls her age, in many ways. She’s a young adult with ambition and drive; so this conversation came out of nowhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept walking up to her door to hear if she was sleeping. It was hard to tell, and I didn’t want to bother her. She deserved her privacy.\n\nInstead, I ended up pulling an all-nighter. I was on my tablet for hours, looking for signs of whatever she talked about. Actual, practical steps towards becoming a ghost. Something about stating your *intention*.\n\nMy eyes had started to roll back into my skull when I finally found a whiff of relevant content. A series of video lectures from someone who called themselves a paranormal researcher. I looked them up; they’re just some loon from some middle-of-nowhere town in Minnesota. Not exactly a leading expert in “post-natural super-mortem experience research”, in my opinion. How is that even a field of study? Doesn’t even make for a good acronym.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this video series was about the practical steps to becoming a ghost, or vengeful spirit. It all sounded very official. They even had charts. And I figured this was where Miri had been inspired.\n\nFirst step? To state your intention. Verbalizing it, and “putting it out there”. They called it a path from “realization to actualization”.\n\nI figured that, hey, at least it was just the first step. And she’d come to me about it, so at least she trusted me enough to share this experience with me; whatever that entails.\n\nThe second step was called “anchoring”. Imprinting an item, piece of clothing or symbol to your identity. Something simple to focus on at the last moment of life, which can become an anchor to your “super-mortem experience”. The video reviewed ways of anchoring, and things that make appropriate anchors. This was where the idea of “haunted” things come from; the anchor.\n\nThe third and final step was by far the most disturbing.\n\nEmotional devastation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy combining an anchor with the intent to pass into a super-mortem being, at the time of massive trauma, you could solidify a super-mortem connection.\n\n“The greater the scale and depth of the trauma, the more potent the reaction.”\n\nThey spoke about it so casually, like it was a high school science experiment. But what they were actually suggesting was nothing short of personal calamity. Murder, death, and tragedy. \n\nWas this really what Miri was aiming for?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, when she was at work, I decided to go through her things. It wasn’t my proudest moment, but I was only doing it to see if there was any more information about these “steps”, and her ambition to follow them. What would it mean, to Miri, to experience emotional devastation? Was she planning something? What would that even look like?\n\nThankfully, I didn’t find anything overtly dangerous. No weapons. No goodbye notes. Nothing out of the ordinary; thank God.\n\nBut there was the second step; an anchor. She had an obvious anchor; her silver cross. It was a necklace she’d worn since she was a kid; a memento from her mom. It was an obvious choice. She rarely, if ever, took it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis put me in a dark place. If she was already at step two, she could be on her way to step three at any moment.\n\nMaybe even right then and there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook, I was in a bad mental space, and this whole situation wasn’t making things better. Miri is her own person, and I support her to the core of my being, but I’m also a father. And that part of me doesn’t go away.\n\nSo I got in my car and I went to see her at work. I was exhausted, panicking, and confused. Didn’t even notice that I parked in the handicapped space; I just stormed in. She was just working her shift, didn’t seem to have a worry in the world. Needless to say, we didn’t have a very constructive conversation. She said some pretty harsh things, and not all of it was untrue. I didn’t stay long.\n\nMiri and I had trouble talking after that. I tried to bring it up during dinner, but she just locked herself in her room with a take-away salad from work. I tried messaging her, but she left me on read. I stood outside her room and asked her to talk to me.\n\nNothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI crashed hard that night. I was exhausted, physically and mentally. Miri still wasn’t talking to me, and I had to recover from my all-nighter. I went to bed early, hoping it would all feel better in the morning.\n\nI wish that was all there was to it. A couple of bad days. But no, there was more.\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night. A single sliver of light peeked in through the bedroom door, poking me in the eye. I turned to face the door, only to see Miri standing in the doorway.\n\nShe just stood there, still in her work clothes. One hand on the doorknob, one hand holding something.\n\nMiri wasn’t looking at me. She had this odd blank stare, like she was looking straight through me. Her mouth hung open, slack jawed. She was panting, as if she’d been running.\n\nI looked at her. She looked back. There was this primal part of me that didn’t recognize her. Something telling me that this wasn’t Miri; this was something else.\n\nSomething dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while, she just up and left; closing the door behind her. I didn’t even notice I’d been holding my breath until the door clicked. It felt like I’d stared down a lion. I hurried up to the bedroom door and reached for the handle.\n\nBut I stopped myself. I’d never locked that door. Miri didn’t lock hers, and I didn’t lock mine. It was a social contract; a show of trust.\n\nBut it brought an important question to mind. How far was I willing to trust my daughter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried talking to her the next day, but I only had a few minutes before she went to work. I had work too, so I couldn’t do much to keep her in the conversation. She just acted like she didn’t know what I was talking about. There was no step three. There was no big plan. She hadn’t been at my door last night. No, no, no. If anything, I was the one being strange.\n\nThat’s how it sounded, at least.\n\nI had trouble staying focused at work. We’d been having some staffing issues, and some of us had to pick up the slack. Micah and his twin boys had been sick after their latest camping trip. Meanwhile, I could barely remember the last time Miri and I spent some quality time together. Between work and her diverging interests, there was little for us to talk about.\n\nAnd now, there was even less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following night, I considered locking my door. I had trouble sleeping. There was that gnawing thought in the back of my mind that maybe, just maybe, I wouldn’t wake up. If Miri was serious about this thing, she might do something stupid. I didn’t like to think about it, but… it was possible. Killing your dad might be one of the most emotionally devastating things one could do. If she really believed in these steps, this “study”, then there was no telling what she might do.\n\nBut somewhere around midnight, I drifted off to sleep.\n\nAnd just like the previous night, it didn’t last very long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up by that stray light hitting my eyes again. I peeked out from the covers, only to see Miri’s silhouette against the hallway light.\n\nThis time, she was holding a knife.\n\n“Miri?” I yawned. “Miri, what are you-“\n\n“Shut up,” she growled.\n\n“Honey, I’m just-“\n\n“Shut. The fuck. *Up*.”\n\nShe’d never spoken to me like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer hands were trembling. Knees bent, like she was ready to pounce. I found myself looking for something to shield myself with, but there was nothing. Maybe I could push her down with a pillow, or wrap her in a bedsheet.\n\nShe took a step forward, but stopped herself. I reacted instinctively and shot out of bed; pressing myself against the wall.\n\nMiri just smiled. Her breathing was forced and rattled.\n\n“Just… just shut the *fuck* up. Let me do this,” she continued. “I *want* to do this.”\n\n“Honey, you have to talk to me.”\n\nFor a moment, she looked up at me.\n\n“You’re right,” she said. “Not tonight.”\n\nAnd then she left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI followed her into the hallway, calling for her to stop this. That we should talk about this. That she was sick, and that I wanted to help her. I just let every word I could find fall out of my mouth like a verbal waterfall, stumbling over my own thoughts along the way. In response, she plunged the kitchen knife straight into the wall; inadvertently cutting the cable to one of the hallway lights.\n\nI just stopped and watched her go back into her bedroom.\n\nThen, she locked her door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat with my phone for hours, contemplating what to do. Who to call, and what to say. I wanted Miri to get help, not jail time. I didn’t know what to do. I looked at all kinds of sites relating to mental breakdowns and illness, but I couldn’t find anything in particular. I kept coming back to this one thought; how far would I go to protect my daughter?\n\nI decided I’d do what little I could. I would call for help in the morning. Until then, I was watching her myself. I dragged a chair through the hallway, past the knife in the wall, and sat down next to her locked door. I’d listen, and I’d make sure she was okay. Then tomorrow, she could get help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must’ve fallen asleep in that chair. I woke up to the sound of a startled shriek, as Miri got out of the room in the morning. She wasn’t prepared to see me there. I could see she was confused, and a bit hurt. This was the Miri I knew and loved; I recognized her.\n\n“I can’t deal with this, dad,” she sighed. “Not like this.”\n\n“We need to talk about last night.”\n\n“I’m not doing this.”\n\nShe picked up her bag and headed for the front door. I followed her.\n\n“Miri, you’re not walking out that door. We’re dealing with this.”\n\n“Aren’t you late for work?”\n\n“Miri, for God’s sake!”\n\nI slammed my hand on the kitchen table, rattling an empty dinner plate from last night. Miri just looked at me and shook her head.\n\n“I’m staying with a friend tonight,” she said. “Sort yourself out.”\n\n“Miri!”\n\nShe was out the door, but I followed her down the driveway. She got in her car, locked the door, and ignored me. I pounded on the window, called out to her, and pleaded. She just backed out and left me there. I didn’t even have my shoes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a sick day, trying to find someone to call for help. Trying to make sense of the symptoms, but I was hitting dead ends at every turn. Some sites called her schizophrenic, others said it could be lead poisoning. One site just kept recommending “overexposure therapy”, whatever that is.\n\nI spent all day on the phone, but no one could tell me anything. They asked me to book a time for consultation, and to take her in for examination. But as soon as I explained that she was legally an adult, the conversation stopped. It seemed that my options were to either call the police, or get her to come voluntarily.\n\nNeither was a feasible option. I couldn’t lose her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried calling Miri all day, but there was no response. She’d either blocked me or turned off her phone. She wasn’t online on her socials, and she wasn’t checking her e-mail. I considered going to her job to talk to her directly, but I’d already tried that once. Going back there might get me barred forever.\n\nI tried to convince myself it was something temporary, or a misunderstanding. I really tried. But the mental image of her standing there with a shaking knife in her hand had been burned into my mind.\n\n“The greater the scale and depth of the trauma, the more potent the reaction.”\n\nI watched the video, over and over. Step three. Step three. Step three.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fell asleep looking at my tablet that night.\n\nAnd for the final time, it didn’t last long.\n\nI woke up again, but not to a strand of light touching my eyes. I woke up to the sound of thumping feet sprinting down the hall; heading straight for my bedroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn’t prepared in the slightest. I thought Miri was staying with her friend. Instead, she burst through the door, knife in hand. She didn’t even stop to breathe; she came straight at me.\n\nI rolled out of bed and tossed my covers at her. She just laughed. And not her signature Miri-laugh, but something… off. A cackling, hysterical laughter. It pulled at a cold nerve along my spine as my pulse raced.\n\nShe was going to kill me.\n\nStep three.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she untangled herself, I hurried into the hallway. I could hear Miri panting behind me, trying to catch up. She was so excited. Manic joy.\n\nI threw myself into the bathroom, slamming the door behind me and turning the lock. I could hear her rush past the door, not even stopping to check. She had a plan.\n\nI didn’t skip a beat; I scrambled for something to defend myself with. Not to hurt her, but maybe hold her down or keep her off. Tie her down, or wrap her in a towel; anything!\n\nBut I didn’t get to think for long before I heard a thump at the bathroom window. I barely had the time to turn my head before she threw herself at it; breaking the glass with reckless abandon, throwing shards all over the floor and falling haphazardly into the empty bathtub.\n\nI backed away, feeling a piece of glass digging into my big toe. Miri struggled to get up.\n\nShe was still laughing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI backed out into the hallway, hearing the crunching noise of crackling glass as Miri got out of the bathtub. I shut the door and held it back, trying to give myself some time to talk to her.\n\nShe threw herself at the door, slamming her head into it over and over.\n\n“Miri!” I called out. “M-Miri, what the hell are you doing?!”\n\nHer laugh grew from maniacal to this deeply unsettling heaving. I could hear the thumping of her head reaching higher and higher. Seconds later, she was just making this awful droning noise, exhaling loudly against the door. The thumping stopped.\n\n“I’m calling the police, Miri. We need to deal with-“\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe door was torn right off its’ hinges, as Miri ripped it out of the frame. She looked about three feet taller, and her one arm had taken on a strange shape; like it had an extra joint.\n\nAnd her face.\n\n*That wasn’t her face anymore.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stumbled backwards. I felt a part of me grow cold as I realized I had a knife lodged deep into my left shoulder. Miri’s long arm had shot out like a scorpion stinger. It was such a shock that my legs just gave out. My body wasn’t responding anymore. My heart’d had enough.\n\nI sank to the floor as she loomed over me.\n\nThis wasn’t my Miri. This was something else, and it was doing something to her just as much as it was to me. I was panicking, not knowing how to save either of us. That dark, sinking feeling where you realize just how fast you’re running out of options.\n\n“*I’m a be a ghost, daddy*,” the thing grinned. “I’m a be a ***ghost***.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mind took me down an unsuspecting road. Akin to your life flashing before your eyes, a realization dawned on me.\n\nThere’d been someone else in my life that’d followed the three steps to become a spirit; maybe inadvertently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMiri’s mother had said one last thing to me the day she lost custody. She had leaned forward, spat on my shoes, and growled;\n\n“I’ll haunt your fucking nightmares.”\n\nShe’d said so many horrible things to me over the years, I hadn’t really thought about it. It was just one more thing in a long list of abusive language. But in the context of those steps? It could be considered an intention.\n\nAnd anchor? Well, the silver cross. It’d meant a lot to her, just as it did to Miri.\n\nAnd emotional devastation, well… pretty much everything about that woman was a tragedy. From the way she lived, to the way she died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a long shot, but it might be her. And looking at the face of Miri’s twisted image, I could recognize the malice. And as it pulled the knife from my shoulder to end me, I did what little I could.\n\nI tore the little silver cross from her neck, put it in my mouth, and bit down; breaking it into two distinct pieces.\n\nWith a desperate shriek, she sunk the knife into me again. I recognized her anger from that day at the courthouse. This was the same woman who’d had Miri taken from her, all those years ago.\n\nAnd with every beat of my heart, the world grew darker, as I bled out on the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut unconsciousness is just like blinking. One moment you’re there, one moment you’re somewhere else. And I went from feeling bad to downright miserable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in a hospital, recovering from three stab wounds. Bandages on my shoulder, hand, and the side of my stomach. There was this parade of people asking to talk to me; a nurse, a doctor, and then a couple of police officers. I insisted that I had to see Miri, and that I wasn’t pressing charges. It was hard to explain how this could all be a misunderstanding, and that I desperately wanted to see my girl again.\n\nThey agreed to let me see her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMiri was wheeled in. Her feet were bandaged from severe glass cuts, so she had to use a wheelchair. There was an awkward silence as they allowed us to speak in private.\n\nWhen we were finally alone, she held my hand tight. I sighed with relief.\n\n“Why would you want this?” I asked. “Why would you want to be a… a spirit?”\n\n“It’s… dad, I’m sorry. I…”\n\nShe took a deep breath and wiped a tear from her eye.\n\n“I just wanted to be like mom.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out, Miri had been getting visits from her mom for years. A whisper in the night, telling Miri to join her. Little hints and nudges. No wonder Miri had such an obsession with ghosts; she was experiencing one almost daily. She was wearing its’ anchor around her neck.\n\nWith that gone, Miri had a clear image of what’d happened. The nightly visits, the obsession. It was like a fog had cleared from her mind.\n\nSuch a relief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, Miri still has an interest in the supernatural to this day. That, if anything, will never change. But now she can explore that interest on her own terms, without any outside influence. And if she still wants to be a ghost, well… that’s her choice. But I don’t think a girl like Miri can go through with step three. She really is a sweetheart. I don’t want anyone to think otherwise.\n\nShe’s still going to WVU, and when all is said and done, I think we can get past this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I wonder.\n\nWhy does she *still* lock her door at night?",

        "text": "This story takes place when I was around 5 years old, in Bolton, UK. My mum came into the room with my food and said “Okay, Lacey. It’s time to wash up and eat your food now.” before she walked out. I stood up and walked to the door when I saw a boy around 8 years old standing outside my bathroom door. I screamed as loud as I could but when my mum arrived he was gone. She told me to eat my food and go to sleep. At 5:43AM I was woken up to the soft sound of breathing in my ear. I turned my head and saw the boy from earlier. Frantically, I crawled away as he grabbed me. He told me “I need your help.” before disappearing again. A few seconds afterwards my dad burst in and asked me what happened. I told him I had a nightmare and he said to go back to bed. I looked at my wrist where the boy had grabbed me. There was a dark red mark shaped like a hand on my wrist, and it stung. Stung so bad. It felt like my skin was being peeled off of my bone whilst my muscles and veins were being bashed repeatedly with a hammer. After breakfast I went upstairs and found a note on my bed. The handwriting was scruffy but I could sort of read it. The note said “Help Me”. After reading it I took it to my mum who told me to stop joking around. Later on while I was brushing my teeth the boy appeared. This time I didn’t scream, or run away. I stayed there and spoke to him.\n“Who are you? What do you want?” I asked cautiously as the boy approached me. His skin was dirty and covered in blood and ash. “My names Charlie my lil pipper. I need your help to ‘scape from this wretched ‘ome” he explained. I told him I would help him. Over time me and Charlie grew closer and would do everything together. One day he didn’t appear and I started to worry. Then my 3 year old brother walked over to me and pointed under my bed. When I looked under there were notes and drawings from Charlie. I looked back at my brother who was now smiling like a maniac before he smashed his toy car into my head. I screamed and began bawling my eyes out while my brother ran off and my parents came dashing in. They asked me what happened but I started hyperventilating. Then I saw Charlie again. He was stood outside watching me. Suddenly he was right infront of me. Nobody else could see him and I started panicking. He grabbed me by the neck and before I could do anything he shoved me against the wall and told me to stay there otherwise he would kill my family. He then began throwing my brothers toys at me. My parents saw this and called the only person they could, my grandma. She came over and started getting rid of Charlie. I had to go to the hospital because I had broken my wrist while dodging the toys. After a while I stopped seeing ghosts, but I know Charlie isn’t fully gone. He’s still here just in a different form.",

        "text": "For a little backstory, I (17fm) been living in this house for a little over five years now, with my parents, sister (14) brother (11) and dog.\n\nFor the first couple years it was fine. After the second year, things started to get a little weird. Things in my bedroom wouldn’t be where I left them, I’d find things I thought I put away back on the counters, stuff that I could just chalk up to my siblings wanting to get on my nerves. Remember I was 12-13 at the time, so I found it pretty childish and a little stupid.\n\nDuring the third year, I was left home alone. My parents and siblings had gone out and I decided I didn’t want to go, so I stayed behind to take care of the dog. I was in the living room, chilling on the couch, scrolling through social media. The dog was cuddled up next to me, so it came as quite a scare when a loud bang echoed from the kitchen. I didn’t think much of it, which, may I add, was pretty stupid of me, so I continued to sit there. After a while, I turned on the tv and started watching shows that my parents weren’t necessarily encouraging me to watch. \n\nWhen another bang came from the kitchen, I paused my show and got up to check it out. Only when I got there did I realize what the noises had been. The back door was thrown open, along with the screen door. I shut it as quickly as possible and locked it. I was pretty scared at this point, and was three seconds from calling my mom and telling her to come home. I decided I’d be fine, and that I didn’t want to ruin my chances of being left alone in the future, so I went back to the living room and unpaused my show. I hadn’t even been watching for another minute, when another bang came from the kitchen. This time, I armed myself with a book from the shelf and crept towards the kitchen once again.\n\nThe fridge door was open. I lowered the book slowly and shut the fridge. I pressed my back against it, trying to calm my breathing. One of the dogs toy balls rolled across the floor and hit me in the side of the foot. I crouched down to pick it up, but froze as my eyes had landed on the partly open bathroom door. The room was dark, but I could make out the unmistakable figure of a human. It was kneeling, almost mirroring my position. I stared at it for about another minute, not even able to scream, until my fight or flight response kicked in. I chucked the book at the thing, ran as fast as I could to the front door and sprinted down the street. My dog chased after me, as though he thought I was playing some sort of game. My heart was thumping loudly and my breathing came out in sharp bursts. \n\nI ran until my legs went numb to the point where I was about to collapse. I dropped down on the curb and tried desperately to catch my breath or slow down my heart but the only thing I could thing about was the figure. I couldn’t have been seeing things. I could have sworn I saw the outline of a human. The back door was open. Someone could have gotten in. Even then… it seemed unlikely. Our neighbourhood hardly had any crime, and when it did, it was something small, like stealing a couple snacks from a cooler, or stealing a little bit of bait for fishing, and the person had always come forward and confessed to it. I refused to go back to that house. I didn’t care that I had left my phone inside. I don’t care that my mom would probably ground me. All I cared about was never going back there.\n\nIt was about 45 minutes later, when I heard my mom calling my name. I ran towards her and she engulfed me in a tight hug. She inevitably brought me back to the house and my stepdad searched the entire place for the creature I had seen. I was grounded, like how I had predicted, but nothing really happened after that, until now. \n\nMy mom had sent me to the basement to get my brothers ice cream cake from the freezer, and I had gone down, not really expecting anything to happen, but was instantly proven wrong. A human figure stood in the dark at the bottom of the stairs, and I almost had a mini heart attack when it took a step towards me. I bolted out of the basement to tell my mom, but when she looked, there was nothing there. She got mad at me for lying, but I know what I saw. It was the same thing I had seen two years back, the thing that had scared me out of the house for 45 minutes. \n\nI haven’t seen it since, but I’m scared to have any of the lights off, even at night when I’m supposed to be asleep. Sometimes, I’ll peek down the basement stairs, but it’ll never be there. I feel like it’s trying to make me think I’m going insane. I guess I’ll never know it’s intentions, but I’m moving out of this house as soon as I get the chance.",

His dark eyes flashed at the photo of Emma, and in a voice that was eerily calm he asked, “I’m sure you know the way to Blackwater Pond?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did. It was a random fishing hole a few miles outside of town. I remembered Mr. B talking about it, he had a cabin there. Rohan nodded and said, “okay, let’s go.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Should we call the police?” I asked timidly as we got into his car and he typed in the coordinates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“There seem to be some odd connections between the sheriff and some citizens here, does there not?” Though he wasn’t looking at me, all I could do was nod and look at my hands. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Dylan” Rohan’s voice pulled me from my thoughts. “I had hoped to have more time to talk to you, but time is of the essence. I need you to tell me exactly what transpired in June. I cannot explain right now, but everything in the next hour hinges on your honesty. Tell me everything.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused for a long moment and then took a deep breath. Then the dam broke. Words mingled with sobs came rushing out of me. I talked about the posts I had seen online, Mr.B pinning Rajat to the ground. The fear in his eyes. I told him about the sheriff and Mr. B. How I thought Mr. B and his friends might have done something bad to Rajat, but I was too scared to speak up. I talked about how afterwards each day made it seem harder and harder to justify coming forward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I talked about the package. The muddy footprints, and Stu Corbett. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRohan listened quietly, asking few questions. He was the first grown up I’d ever really talked to like this. Usually they just pretend to listen so they can tell you what they think, but not him, he *listened*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finally finished and sat quietly in the passenger seat, he glanced at me with a reassuring smile. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Feel better?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I would, but all I can think about now is Emma.” I didn’t think I had any tears left, but more crept into my eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“She‘ll be fine.” He said with quiet confidence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“How can you know that?” But even as I asked, I believed him. His strange calmness seemed to be stealing over me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe flashed me another smile and said cryptically, “I’ve found in situations like these, it helps to have friends in high *and* low places.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t have time to let that sink in, because he announced “we’re here.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. B was waiting for us by the front of his truck with his rifle in hand when we pulled into his lane. I didn’t see Mr. Marshall at first, but then spied him pulling Emma out of the truck. Though I was powerless against them, my hands clenched at my sides when I saw her bound hands and wild eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRohan placed himself between me and Mr. B and began speaking calmly to him. His serenity didn’t touch Mr. B though, it only seemed to make him madder. He started screaming about terrorists and ISIS, plus all sorts of racist filth at Rohan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“As I have said, I am only trying to locate the whereabouts of Rajat Seth. His family is very worried.” Rohan kept saying calmly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was then I noticed the pond. Churning water and bubbles approached the shore as Mr. B kept screaming at Rohan and Mr. Marshall held tight to Emma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRohan noticed too and I saw him subtly shift his stance so he now stood between me and the water. Mr. B seemed to see me for the first time, and began to scream at me too. Calling me a coward and a traitor, telling me I never belonged in our neighborhood. My first instinct was to turtle up. But I could tell Rohan wanted to keep him talking. So I did something I never thought possible of myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“*I’m* the coward?” I yelled loudly, surprising even myself. “I forgot how brave you were in June, what was it again? Three plus a roll of duct tape on one?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilence floated across the lawn for a moment before I saw Mr.B’s hand tighten on the gun and I heard Mr. Marshall chuckle, “you just signed your death warrant son.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. B lost his mind at that point. Screaming about how he’d kill every invader that set foot in his town, that the mouthy little shit in the van deserved what he got, that our country had gone to hell. To be honest, I wasn’t focused on any of it. I was focused on the water behind him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA slim, dark figure had erupted from the pond and was limping toward the men facing us. Charred and bloated, it was still the unmistakable face that had been seared into my mind since June. Rajat Seth dragged himself forward purposefully toward the two men in front of him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Marshall was so intent on the show Mr. B was putting on, that he didn’t notice until Rajat was almost on top of him. Emma must have been waiting for a change in grip, because as soon as Rajat grabbed hold of Mr. Marshall, Emma ripped free and began sprinting toward me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. B turned and checked Emma as she ran past, and sent her sprawling headfirst into the front of the truck. She lay still, knocked out cold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to run to her, but Rohan stopped me, his eyes still locked on the creature in front of us. He kept muttering something under his breath. My knees buckled as the creature that was Rajat Seth ripped Mr. Marshall’s head right off his body with no more effort than twisting the top off a soda. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. B was screaming again, but in terror this time. He seemed to remember at the last minute that he had a gun, and started firing. Rajat kept coming, and at last Mr. B threw down his gun and dove for his truck. He managed to get the door shut, but it was promptly ripped off its hinges. I shut my eyes as blood sprayed inside the truck and Mr.B’s screams cut off abruptly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe silence that followed seemed more ominous than the shrieks that had filled the air. Silence, but for Rohan’s quiet muttering. I stupidly opened my eyes, expecting the creature to be gone. Maybe expecting to wake up. Instead it stood before us, with its dull milky eyes staring right at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shrank further behind Rohan as his chanting intensified. The creature began to come toward us. It seemed to be fighting him, chittering and screeching. Finally Rohan said forcefully,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Enough, Bagdana, he feels guilt for his cowardice, nothing more. Begone.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe creature paused for a moment, swaying in the wind. Then slowly, its mouth began to gape open. I tasted my lunch as a grey, scrawny hand climbed up from inside Rajat’s throat. A skeletal humanoid figure pulled itself out of Rajat’s impossibly wide mouth, and threw his body on the ground like an ill-fitting coat. It hissed at Rohan, and turned toward the pond. It glanced back once or twice at me hungrily, but disappeared into the murky depths as instructed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRohan let out a breath I didn’t know he was holding and walked briskly to Emma. I stood frozen, not trusting the suspiciously calm water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Just a knock on the head.” Called Rohan as he assessed Emma. He picked her up gently and placed her in the back of his sedan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Coming?” He asked. I blinked and opened my mouth to speak. Rohan held up a hand.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Questions are for the car. Time to go.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe drove for a few moments in silence, then Rohan interjected as I began to speak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I can’t tell you everything Dylan, so I’m going to ask that you consider your questions carefully.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What the hell was that thing?” I blurted out immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What you saw first were the murdered remains of Rajat Seth. The creature inside was an associate of mine, the Jewish demon Bagdana.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Why did it attack Mr. B and Mr. Marshall? Why did it try to get at me? Did it kill Mr. Corbett?” The questions tumbled over my lips and Rohan closed his eyes and groaned, looking sheepish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, I have a small apology to make. Bagdana was here at my request. Mr. Seth’s family were desperate for answers, by whatever means necessary. And willing to pay a very dear price. I called upon him to seek out those with guilt in their hearts relating to Mr. Seth’s fate. It’s very tricky to talk to demons, even one as forgiving as Bagdana. Your guilt also caught you in his trap as well. I hope that you can find it within your heart to forgive me for what you’ve gone through”  He seemed so sincere that I had to duck my head and mutter “s’okay.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Mr. B didn’t seem very guilty.” I remarked suddenly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Guilt is guilt Dylan. No matter how many layers of justification you wrap around something, at the core is still the raw guilt. That’s what Bagdana is so good at sniffing out.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Are you Jewish? How do you know how to call B-Bagdana?”  I whispered, surveying the roadside, half expecting to see the humanoid creature skittering toward me again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRohan smiled, “No, I’m not Jewish, but I spent many years studying demons and other entities. As my path in life has shifted, I find it helpful to call upon them occasionally.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI studied the road for a moment, unsure of how to word the thoughts floating around in my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You said it was my cowardice that I felt guilty for. Do you think I’m a coward?” I examined a scuff in my shoe as I asked the question, dreading the answer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilence stretched on in the car as I waited, and I felt my stomach roll over as Rohan pulled the car over to the side of the road. I looked up, and was met again with his kind smile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Dylan, I need you to understand that it doesn’t matter what I think. I could tell you a hundred times that you did the best that you could, and you wouldn’t believe me, unless you came to believe it yourself.” I nodded and felt my eyes fill with more tears. He continued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You were faced with something very intense at a young age. If I can offer some advice, it may only be that you are not so quick to discount your feelings in the future. Had you listened to your shame, guilt or fear earlier, then you may not have ended up in this situation.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe sat in silence for another moment. Rohan pulled the car back onto the road and something else occurred to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I have another question.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe smiled and waited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What was in the box?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe chuckled and asked conspiratorially, “Are you sure you want to know?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded eagerly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Absolutely nothing.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Anything else?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes. What price did Rajat’s family pay?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRohan sighed, “that, I cannot disclose. Just pray you never need to pay it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe drove the rest of the way home in silence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs he turned into my neighborhood I suddenly had a thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What about everything back at the lake? The bodies? Our prints may be on something. What should I say? What should I tell my parents?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRohan said softly, “I can assure you that those details have been taken care of, this time. But in the future Dylan, I implore you, when you see something unjust, say something. It may be the more difficult conversation at the moment, but I promise every time that it happens, you'll become stronger for it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was right, things were taken care of. When we got home, I put Emma on the couch. She woke up, without a scratch on her, remembering nothing. A few days later Mr. B and Mr. Marshall’s bodies were found by Blackwater Pond. I don’t know the details of how they were found, but the police chalked it up to a murder-suicide. I finally got the courage to tell my parents about that day in June, and together we talked to the police. They dragged the pond and found Rajat’s body. I didn’t feel proud of myself, but I felt better. I wanted to tell Rohan that I did it, but he’d made me give his card back, and his number disappeared from my phone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, I’ve tried my best to live by his advice. I didn’t have many friends before, but I found that speaking up for what I thought was right gained me a few. Good people, too. I don’t always make the right choice (who does?) but I’m getting better at living in a way that makes myself proud. I have good motivation too - whenever I slip, whenever I want to turtle back up again, I just remember there are people like Rohan. People who can talk to the things that live in the dark places. I remember what lurks beneath the surface at places like Blackwater Pond. And how they treat guilty cowards like Mr. B and his friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[X.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingsOfEvelynReece/)",
