        "text": "A similar question was answered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/24b5yh/thats_what_you_and_your_business_needs_or_need/) a few years ago, but my question is a bit different; I do not have a plural subject. I am creating a heading in a document which, among other headings on the page, will be a portion of the overall document. The content that follows this heading discusses the needs of the businesses that might want to use our services and products via a bulleted list. I keep thinking that \"Business Need\" is fine, even for multiple statements underneath it because I believe when used like this, \"need\" becomes a collective noun and requires no pluralization. For example:\n\n**BUSINESS NEED**\n\n* Things the client experiences\n* Things the client experiences\n* Things the client experiences, etc.\n\nbut here, in this next example, though it is still a collective noun, it's pluralized:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BUSINESS NEEDS**\n\n* Things the client experiences\n* Things the client experiences\n* Things the client experiences, etc.\n\nTechnically, I believe the first example to be the most grammatically correct (like \"find the difference\" vs \"find the differences,\" or \"accommodation\" vs \"accommodations\" the added \"s\" is unnecessary), but I thought I'd see what the thoughts are of other grammarians here. So, please have at it. :D Thank you!",

However, it doesn't seem to sit naturally in the context I need it:\n\nIn a fictional universe, there are talismans that represent different positive and negative attributes. A talisman of courage/fear, a talismon of love/hate etc. The format to describe these talismans is always \"The Talisman Of *(Attribute)*\".\n\nRecreant is the perfect antonym for one of the positive attributes (in terms of the story, its opposite is the theme of reliability - that someone will always be there in times of trouble - whereas a recreant is cowardly and unfaithful, and more likely to abandon you) but **The Talisman of Recreant** doesn't sit right. Talisman of *the* recreant sounds better, like Talisman of the coward might, but this would make the format of this talisman's name different.\n\nI'm hoping that there is someway to modify *recreant* in the same way that you would modify *coward* in to *cowardly*, but *recreantly* doesn't sound right at all nor does it appear to be a valid word.\n\nI appreciate that this is an archaic word, and it might not be possible, but if anyone has any insights or suggestions I would be very grateful.
