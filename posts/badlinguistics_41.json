        "text": "Started my freshman year at university a couple weeks ago. My school has \"freshman seminars\" which are essentially small (18) discussion classes only for freshmen (it's in the name!), so I signed up for one about US-Latin American relations that also has a focus on document analysis and the teaching of historiography. \n\nSo, one of the professors for this class is asking us a few weeks ago about whether or not Haiti is a Latin American country, and why we think so or not. One girl in the class answers that it isn't, and when the professor asks her fairly bluntly to extrapolate, she says they don't speak Spanish, so it can't be Latin American. This student had previously agreed that Brazil was a Latin American country, and so the professor mentions that the original idea of a Latin America was based on descending from those countries with 'Latinate languages', so if Spain and Portugal count, why shouldn't French? \n\nThe student, of course, responded \"well, it's not real French, it's broken French\".\n\nGood to know we're off to a good start",
