The way they live, performing repetitive tasks, watching the same things over and over again, eating the same food, not seeing the outside world, the whole concept of pedaling for merits just disturbs me to the core. They have almost no choice in what their life is going to turn out, and when they do, in order to get out from that lifeless life, they have to betray their own standards and what they stand for. In a way, I find it eerily similar to the real world and how people live their lives. Repetitive tasks, doing things that are required from you in order to progress in your career, which you may not always support. Everyday pedaling reminds me of slave work, in a way similar to manufacturing clothes and shoes in factories in the undeveloped countries. I see it as a far-fetched version of our own reality.",

Rule 4 says reposts will be removed at the mods' discretion, but that doesn't seem to be the case lately. Many of these look like they're posted within hours or less than a few days of each other. Surely sorting by 'new' would cut down on this?\n\n**Also**, I'm in no way trying to come off as rude, especially to the mods with my comment about reposts not being removed. I just wanted to put this out there and hopefully get people to check if the same exact thing has already been posted an hour or a day before.",

        "text": "After viewing the first episode of Black mirror, the unbearable 'National anthem', I thought I'd give it one more try. However, unfortunately, what I suspected largely turned out to be true: Black mirror is an inexplicably hyped series that is not worth watching. \n\nThe protagonist is riding bikes, locked in a big building for no reason whatsoever (it seems). Only in the premise to the movie it is explained that this is to generate energy. Why the protagonist remains there and what his motivation is to keep going, we do not know. Is he locked there for eternity? Is he a prisoner? Granted, we do not HAVE to know everything when watching a movie, but where most of the time the fact that certain things remain a mystery triggers your curiosity, here it is just plain irritating. \n\nThe bike riders watch gross TV shows, which is a clear metaphor for nowadays TV that has less and less intellectual value. \n\nAgain, for no reason whatsoever (except for the fact he finds her attractive) the protagonist gives all his merits to a girl so she can sing on the main TV hit 'Hot Spots' in order to rise to stardom. Unfortunately it turns out very differently and she becomes a porn star. \n\nThen the protagonist sees it as his ultimate duty to warn everybody about how horrible and automated the world has become but instead ends up being a star himself. Again, he forgets about his darling and just plays along. Again, inexplicable. \n\nThe script is sooo bad, so illogical and full of expected twists that it just hurts to watch. Apart from this it is terribly monothematic and also a shameful rip-off from Orwell's 1984. The similarities are staggering: isolation and suppression of the common man, isolation of people from each other, man against the machine and ultimately the bleak truth that nobody can beat the 'machine' - all there but in a slightly different environment and poured into our throats with a slightly different sauce. Like most pop songs nowadays - no inventivity, no originality - just plain covers with a half-baked altered beat.\n\nIf it were not for the quite good acting of the protagonist and the general message of warning against blatant consumptionism (which is indeed dangerous) I would have given this episode a 1, just like the first episode of Black mirror.\n\nBlack mirror does not deserve any higher ratings as it takes itself far too seriously whilst serving us ridiculous or plagiarized scripts. Worst thing is that everyone is drooling over these series as if they had seen the light.",

        "text": "Aside from my numerous nitpicking issues with the episodes, several strange things stood out to me. \n\n1) How were the utilities still on in the house? It's clear that most areas have been abandoned and in the case of the house, the owner had commited suicide. So why are the utilities on? Logically they would have been shut off ages ago yet Bella is able to wash up and the dog is able to access the keypad to open the gate. \n\n2) Why didn't Bella patch up the open wound on her leg? The dog was able to track Bella using the trail of blood from her leg but that could have all been avoided if she took the time to wrap the wound. She spent a whole night in the tree where she could have took the time to repurpose a bit of clothing as a bandage. Further more, how did the wound keep bleeding? It's pretty unlikely that the blood would not eventually clot unless she was anemic or something like that. \n\n3) Why in the world would three survivors venture out into the world without any weapons knowing that there are killer robot dogs? This is a glaring issue. It just doesn't make sense to venture out to gather supplies and risk your life without having any sort of self defense. \n\n4)After the night in the tree the dog's battery presumably dies, but then reactivated later for absolutely no reason. Is it solar? If so then why didn't it reactivate earlier? \n\n5) Finally, why was the dog guarding a box of teddy bears? What is the purpose? Was it just chance? It seems that the placement was intentional as the dog returns to the warehouse at the end of the episode. \n\nOf course, this Is just my opinion and my opinion is by no means necessarily correct. All of this said, I quite enjoyed the episode but it definitely did have it's issues. If you think you have a rebuttal, correction, or agreement to any of my points then leave a comment and we will discuss.",

However, in the latter two seasons, They seem way more hit or miss. I didn't enjoy Men Against Fire, Hated in the Nation, Crocodile, Metalhead, or Black Museum (almost half the episodes in both seasons) And even then the episodes I did like STILL didn't seem up to snuff with pre-Netflix episodes. I don't really see any reason for the drop in quality, so I was wondering if any of you noticed the same thing, or any reasons for it happening.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I am going on a short vacation coming up, and am looking for a book to read to pass the traveling time. I have looked through multiple posts, and have narrowed it down to two different choices: \n\n-The Illustrated Man (Ray Bradbury)\nor\n-Axiomatic: Short Stories of Science Fiction (Greg Egan)\n\nI really like Black Mirror for the dystopian view on technology, and have a huge thing for the famous plot twists at the end. Could you guys help me pick which book to buy that feels most like Black Mirror? Thanks! ",

I was really satisfied...then they showed that Blue was still alive and was about to catch the killer. \n\nThis felt like a divination from Black mirror's usual stories that just leave a bad taste in your mouth (and mind). Mostly Black Mirror shows realistic and bleak stories where there is no final recovery. It is what it is, the heroes are dead and a great tragedy ensues. THAT was what I liked about BM, that was what made it different from other shows, that was what got me hooked in the first place. It would have not been too far from perfect for me if they just stopped the episode with Karin in the car surrounded by angry protestors.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?  ",
