It really has held up beautifully in so many ways (except the son is like the 90s-est kid *ever*). Even topically, sadly so little has changed (in many ways regressed) but the way that transition vs drag was addressed was done incredibly well. And of course the costumes and cinematography are phenomenal. It's just a great movie in so many ways.\n\nAnd an honest admission here: I have never seen To Wong Foo. It came out too close on the heels to Priscilla and just seemed like it was trying to capitalize off the popularity with American aaudiences, so I couldn't bring myself to watch it when it was new and never especially compelled to watch it since. Is it worth watching? Based on my love of Priscilla, is it probable I would enjoy it?",

If I'm not mistaken the whole movie was about ducks or some type of bird.\n\nI have a distinct picture in my head of the ducks kind of looking like the seagulls from finding Nemo and maybe having a black ring around their necks. Most of my memories are coming from an old McDonald's toy.\n\nThe movie would have been released late 90's or early 2000's. I've spent maybe 3 hours googling animated bird movies and can't find it.

And it has some stunts so insane I wonder how they could have been done without CGI (like when &gt;! she does a double flying knee and stuffs the goon into a sewer pipe !&lt;) because otherwise I think I just saw the lead actress murder someone.\n\nBut this fight scene is, hands down, the most conceptually insane fight I've ever seen in a serious movie:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bV-QOCV6LTA\n\nHere is what happens: &gt;! The main character, Zen, has a mental handicap (I wouldn't call it that, I think it's supposed to be a form of autism, but they call it a mental handicap) that gives her a difficult life, but also gives her the ability to master martial arts just by watching them. She's been kicking ass this entire movie and nobody has been able to offer a challenge to her... until she meets this other teenager with a mental handicap (Tourettes?). He lays a beating on her and she finally overcomes it *by using her mental handicap to adopt his mental handicap!* !&lt;\n\nNow, I've seen crazier premises for a fight seen (Top Secret!), but never in a serious martial arts movie. And this is played straight, this is not campy fun or over-the-top satire.\n\nI just finished the movie and I'm still in stunned disbelief just thinking about it. I cannot emphasize enough, this is a serious, dramatic movie without any meta commentary on the action genre.\n\nI just had to share because I'm curious what you all have to contribute to the discussion of serious, insane fight scenes.",

Why the hell aren’t they speaking their own language?

Another reason that I don’t watch them much is because I’m English and I don’t want to stay up till 1 am to watch them. So where are you guys watching from (if you’re watching them at all) who with and any themed parties going on? I’ve stocked up on coke to keep me going but not sure if I’ll last the night!",

Then he made movies. My brother and I loved him when we were really young and honestly I still love the movies. I'm just wondering if anyone else watched him and liked him too lol",
