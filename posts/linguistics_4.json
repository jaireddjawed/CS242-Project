When someone can't remember or doesn't know a word in a sentence they will make one up using a construction that makes sense--not necessarily \"real\" but can be understood. For example: \"He always abides by the rules. His \"abidement\" of the rules was always expected.\" In this case, there is a real word (abetment), but the speaker just doesn't know or remember it.   \n  \nAnd is there a difference between a made up word as a placeholder that's close to right but just formed incorrectly, and something like \"on-timely-ness\"? Something that isn't really a guess at a real word (like saying punctualness instead of punctuality)?  \n  \nI'm wondering because i had an interesting conversation yesterday with someone about \"shit-gibbons\" and wondered about all the words I didn't know there are words for!",

        "text": "Hello all! \n\nI just started the Linguistics program at UMass and I'm already feeling a little unsure of myself when it comes to transcription. I would be appreciative of any tips, tricks, or resources you might be willing to recommend. \n\nI understand the idea of how the IPA chart works, but I'm not exactly great at figuring out what something might sound like especially when putting sounds together. Even more so with sounds that I can't seem to differentiate between when listening to audio clips associated with the type of sound. \n\nI understand also that broad transcription will vary depending on who is doing the transcription, so maybe I am just overthinking things. \nAs an example, during one of our discussion sessions, we were practicing transcription and I remember that the word 'you' was transcribed as [joʊ]. But personally, I would have chosen something closer to [jʉ], and this site (http://ipa-reader.xyz/) seems to say that is more in line with how I (a native English speaker) would pronounce the word. Is this reader giving an accurate pronunciation or should I figure something else out? If I'm not doing narrow transcription, is it even that big of a deal? \n\nAlso, are vowels a pain for everyone? I think it has a lot to do with the IPA's usage of letters in the English alphabet and my associating a particular sound with it, so maybe that'll just require some rewiring and rote memorization or something. \n\nAnyway, thanks for any and all advice.",

When I started writing a comment about a famous singer, I wondered for a second on whether I should write it as 'themself'. For me, the 's' in 'themselves' indicates the plural which conflicts with the fact I am referring to one person. \n\nOn the one hand, thinking analogically, the forms 'myself', 'yourself', 'herself/himself' and 'itself' all share a similar feature - the 'self' refers to one person/thing. If I refer to one non-binary person, why not use 'themself'?\n\nOn the other hand, both 'yourself' and 'yourselves' exist thus indicating the difference between singular and plural. I think that such a change in the plural reflexive pronoun 'themselves' would bring a better understanding of the situation and the plural and non-binary use would be more easily distinguishable. \n\nPlease keep the comments respectful, as I do not want to add any political or even social factor in the discussion. 'Themselves' just sounds wrong to me in that case and I want to hear your opinions as linguists/fans of languages :)",

        "text": "Let me start by saying I recognize the general invalidation of the original model. I consider myself as open to the possibility of a neo-Whorfian theory (eg Lera Boroditsk) because it makes sense within the context of cognitive linguistics (which I do work in). I’m re-reading The Ego Tunnel by Metzinger (philosopher who experimentally investigates the nature of self and consciousness), and I just stumbled across a part where he says that without having a word for it, there may be emotional states that go psychologically unidentified (at least specifically). Again, I’m open to the possibility of that. \n\nBut it lead me to wonder if anyone has looked into the possibility of the absence of an emotional concept in a culture and their religious beliefs? If we hypothesized a culture without a word for “evil,” could they have an evil god? Let’s say our culture has a socio-psychological explanation for deviant behaviors that gives them a fully causal model with no absolute recourse to free will. By a quirk of intellectual history, these people developed those ideas but are still at a very developmental stage of their culture where they are developing religions mythologies and pantheons. S-W (even in the weakened version) would predict that they wouldn’t have an evil god, but instead have a god with a really bad childhood, as a result of which he causes earthquakes.\n\nI think we would run into a problem in that some of the most interesting examples (ancient Egyptian and Hebrew, eg) have a significant volume of their texts specifically as religious documents, which creates a circular dependency. But still, could we look at the semantic differences between Ancient Greek and Latin, and compare them to ancient Chinese regarding the concepts they use to characterize affect/personality? I’m trying to think of cultures where we have significant religious texts as well as significant literary/philosophical texts. We also might be able to look at the relationship between indigenous languages and religions. \n\nSo my question is whether this has been done yet, because I think it might be interesting.",

I tried to discuss this issue at r/debateReligion, but it's full of edgy people whose whole purpose is to make fun of religion. \n\nNow I'm personally not a religious person, and I don't believe in the Bible, but I am capable of having a civil discussion about this matter with people who have different views. \n\nWell what troubles me is that the Bible claims to describe how God have created the universe and all the living beings including the humans, but at no point it mentions where did the first language came from. God just made Adam and Eve, and they just started talking to each other.  But in what language? And where did that language came from? The Bible just presents it as a given, as something that need no explanation, like God made people and they immediately started talking, no questions asked. And I have a problem with that. Here is my full post :\n\n\n**I feel like the Bible had to mention when and how the language had appeared. Like in the Genesis book when it says \"in first day God created this, and in second day he created that...\", I feel like it had to mention when God created the language. \n\nI mean think about it, it leads us to many interesting questions:\n\n- was there any language before God created the universe?\n\n-if yes, then what was it and what was it used for? If not, then when did it appear? In the Garden of Eden? Was it later when humans were expelled to Earth? \n\n-if God created the language in order to be able to speak to humans, then what was it? Was there like the first dictionary and the first grammar book? And how did God decide how many words to add to that language? And is it OK that we humans keep adding new words to that language as the time passes, since we keep discovering new things that require new words. \n\n-and if language is man made, then how God was able to speak to humans before they created the first language? \n\n\nI feel that the fact that the Bible completely omits the origin of language, and treats it as a given, is very problematic and it is a weakness of the book, that claims to be \"the book\" of God. It's like a very important piece of our history, and it is completely ignored by the Bible. **",

Like the action of running is considered a one-place predicate with it's argument being the agent \"runner\" because it's the agent that is often obligatory to be expressed in a sentence about running.\n\nTo illustrate my point more consider the difference between these two sentences: \n\n\\-the cat outran the mouse\n\n\\-the cat ran faster than the mouse\n\nThe difference between \"run\" and \"outrun\" for me can be one of two things: it can be a semantic difference (run: imagine something running, outrun: imagine something running faster than something else), or that both refer to the action of running and the only difference is in the language: one has only the agent as obligatory to express \"the subject\" and the other has the runner and a slower runner as to be obligatory expressed.\n\nTaking the second view makes me think that there are no \"semantic arguments\" and that arguments are just things that have some relation, no matter how direct or indirect it feels, to the predicate that for some reason are obligatory to be expressed in some language. So nothing semantic.\n\nSo what view would be right? Is there anything wrong in the way I think of this? Thanks in advance for any useful answer.",

We would likely understand from the context the word is a verb.\n\nWe do the same with a noun, without adding any morphems. (Да он это...) \"Это\" - noun\n\n We also do the same with participles. \"ПРОэтоВАННЫЙ телефон\"...\n\nDo you guys do the same in your languages and how in detail do you guys do that?",

I'm currently writing my bachelor's thesis on superlatives and a large part of it is based on Bobaljik's \"Universals in comparative morphology\". This is written within a distributed morphology framework, and while it's generally really helpful because he provides some structures for morphological and periphrastic comparatives&amp;superlatives, I'm struggling to figure out what the structure for a periphrastic superlative that is based on a morphological comparative would look like. I'm aware this is very specific and probably not very understandable without knowing the exact structures I'm talking about. Anyway, I think what might help me to figure it out myself would be to know more about Distributed Morphology in general, especially if there is any overlap with X-bar theory. And how exactly does merger work? Bobaljik gives some examples of structures that merger is applied to and the associated outcome, but it's not clear to me what happens in between. I hope someone here can help me, I'm also open to literature recommendations if you know of any that might be useful for me in this situation!\n\nTl;dr: 1. Is there an overlap between Distributed Morphology and X-bar theory? 2. How exactly does Merger work?",

        "text": "Hello! This is my classification to understand when a speech is a language or dialect. You don’t have to agree with me.\n\nSo we all know that most languages descend from other languages. For example, English and Scots descend from Middle English. Middle English and Modern English aren’t the same stage. However, Early Modern English is in the same stage as that Modern English.\n\nSo when something descends from an earlier stage of a language, then it could be considered it’s own language. Scots doesn’t descend from Early Modern English, so it could be considered it’s own language because it descended, not from English, but from Middle English.\n\nFor example, I speak a language. This language, in the future, will branch off into separate languages and it will have stages. Say I speak the Proto-Language in the year 8938 BC. Many years later, the language changed so much that it became Old Language. Then Middle Language. All of these are different stages. So what if in the present time, I speak the Modern Language and somebody else speaks a dialect of the language. If this dialect descends from Middle Language, then it should be considered a sister language to my language instead of a dialect of it. It this dialect descends from the Modern Language, then it should be considered a dialect of it. Understood?\n\nWhat if a dialect descends from Modern Language, but isn’t mutually intelligible with it. Then we look at its features. Phonological features won’t matter much because if the only change was in the phonology, then it’s just an accent. If there were changes in grammar, phonology, syntax and other things, then it should be considered it’s own language.\n\nPlease don’t send me hate for disagreeing. If you disagree, please dm me or reply to me and tell me why.",

While it is not typical to have distinct words for objects \"having existed for a relatively long period of time\" and humans/animals \"having lived for most of the expected years\", aka \"old\" and \"old\". Am I even right in thinking that this is the case for European languages?\n\nI became curious about all this when I found out that at least in some Turkic and Finno-Ugric languages there are indeed distinct words for those two meanings of \"old\" (Kazakh ескі vs кəрі, Komi важ vs пöрысь).\n\nSo the question is, is not having two \"old\" adjectives the more popular strategy universally, or is it just a trait that the European languages happen to have? And if it is universal, is there an explanation why it is more beneficial to distinguish between new things and young people than to distinguish between old things and old people?",

Many of the comments are talking about how, while the pronunciation is *somewhat* irregular, there actually *are* patterns that I could also recognize. Heck, even I feel like the pronunciation is not *that* irregular, as at least some could be analyzed as consonant shift and vowel reduction? (like 45 پینتایس /pɛ̃taːliːs/ from 5 پانچ /pãːtʃ/ and 40 چالیس /tʃaːliːs/)\n\nI am no native speakers, and the Wikipedia article talking about Hindustani Numerals also don't talk about the supposed patterns. Asking my tutor (and another tutor, claiming that he has a Master degree in Urdu) and they can't (won't?) answer my question about ں as a nasalization of vowel (keep saying that it's a ن but \"unfinished\", which actually made me really confused lol) so I'm not very convinced they can talk in great detail about this.\n\nWhat are the sound changes that happen? Are there actually phonological rules that makes sense, or each and every number is an \"exception\"?",

        "text": "After discussing UG with a colleague, I think I have a better grasp of the roots causes of why the concept of UG is as controversial as it is. There are a few points from this conversation that I wanted to raise here as a thought provoking exercise. \n\nFundamentally, proponents of UG seem to have lost sight of the ultimate question that is trying to be answered, which is “how and why do young children learn languages so quickly despite their poverty of stimulus?” UG is a proposed explanation for how humans acquire language so quickly, which proposes that something about the grammar of language itself is already genetically wired into the brain from birth. That said, the mere existence of the poverty of stimulus is not evidence for UG, just as the fact that the horizon appears flat is not evidence for the earth itself being flat. \n\nMore importantly, UG is not really a linguistic theory so much as a biological theory that concerns human use of language. The only evidence that can truly support or bury UG can be found outside of linguistics, because merely saying that all languages have X in common linguistically is applicable to multiple explanations to the language acquisition question, and in any case after 70 years of UG linguistics still has not provided any of these supposed universals other than allegedly “recursion.” But recursion, or the mental abilities that underly recursion, such as the ability to nest thoughts and concepts within other thoughts and concepts, is not specific to linguistics. The cognitive ability to conceive of the implications of multiple overlapping concepts and facts is useful for cognitive analysis in general, and would have been useful to have evolved well before language first arose.\n\nWe know for certain that humans were already getting smarter well before language first arose. The existing known fossil record of human ancestor species over the last 3-4 million years reveals a constant increase in brain size and evidence of more and more sophisticated tool use and other cognitive abilities as time went on. Pattern recognition is a key component of cognition and intelligence, and would have been a useful cognitive ability well before language existed. Humans are the only animals that have language, but humans are also on a completely different plane of intelligence compared to other animals, and there’s every reason to think that the development of human language occurred incrementally in tandem with, and as a side effect of, simultaneous increases in intelligence we were evolving at the same time.\n\nBy contrast, there is no biological mechanism to explain UG. Chomsky thinks it was a point mutation out of nowhere 50,000-100,000 years ago. But it’s implausible that such a complex mental ability would have evolved all at once like that out of nowhere through a single mutation. That’s not how evolution works. \n\nFurthermore, where is this gene if it’s a single gene? Why haven’t we found it since gene mapping has become so widespread? Where are the people who can’t use language because their version of this gene is broken through another mutation, but that are otherwise normally intelligent? \n\nIt is truly incredible that UG is as academically widespread and accepted within the field of linguistics as it is despite the fact that not only has it not been proven, but most of evidence regarding the question it’s trying to answer support completely different answers. I fear that the development of linguistics over the years has been hindered by Chomsky’s stature in the field, because instead of trying to actually answer these kinds of questions and issues regarding UG, its supporters instead have gravitated towards redefining UG into merely the ability to learn language itself, as if anyone who were to try to ask serious questions about the existence of UG was questioning the tautological truth of the fact that humans can learn language.",

Thoughts?  \n\n\nInterplanetary linguistics is a new and exciting field that aims to study the languages of extraterrestrial species. To successfully learn these languages, linguists must employ specialized strategies and techniques considering the unique challenges of studying languages from different planets.\n\nBasic Principles\n\n1. Understand the role of grammar in the language. Pay particular attention to the aspectual system, as this may differ from any language on Earth.\n2. Take a targeted intervention approach. Focus on key aspects of the language that are critical for communication, such as the universal perfect.\n3. Engage in extensive exposure to examples of the language in context. This will help you develop accurate representations of the language and its aspectual system.\n4. Practice using the language in various communicative situations. This will help you become more proficient in language use and improve your ability to communicate with extraterrestrial beings.\n5. Please be aware of the probabilistic nature of language acquisition. Your understanding of the language may fluctuate as you continue to analyze the language, and this is a natural part of the learning process.\n\nStrategies\n\n1. Could you take detailed notes on the language? This will help you keep track of basic patterns and features of the language.\n2. Use visual aids to help you understand the language. For example, create diagrams or flowcharts to represent the aspectual system.\n3. Work in teams. Collaborate with other linguists to share ideas and strategies for studying the language.\n4. Use technology to help you study the language. For example, use speech recognition software to help you analyze the sound patterns of the language.\n5. Seek feedback from native speakers. Ask them to clarify any aspects of the language you find confusing or difficult to understand.\n6. Develop a deep understanding of the culture of the species whose language you are studying. This will help you understand the language in context and better communicate with extraterrestrial beings.\n\nThat field requires specialized strategies and techniques to study the languages of extraterrestrial species successfully. By applying the principles and procedures outlined in this field manual, linguists can effectively learn the language and develop accurate representations of the aspectual system. Please remember to take a targeted intervention approach, engage in extensive exposure and practice, and understand the probabilistic nature of language acquisition. With the development of this field, we can further understand the communication between different species and even form interplanetary alliances.\n\nAs linguists in this field, we must employ specialized strategies and techniques considering the unique challenges of studying languages from different planets.\n\nTo successfully study these languages, we must first understand the role of grammar in the language. We should pay particular attention to the aspectual system, as this may differ from any language on Earth. Once we have a basic understanding of the language, we should take a targeted intervention approach, focusing on crucial language aspects critical for communication, such as the universal perfect.\n\nExtensive exposure to language examples in context is also critical for developing accurate representations of the language and its aspectual system. We should practice using the language in various communicative situations to become more proficient in our use of the language and improve our ability to communicate with extra-terrestrial beings.\n\nRecognizing the probabilistic nature of language acquisition is also essential. Our understanding of the language may fluctuate as we continue to analyze it, which is a natural part of the learning process. Therefore, we should take detailed notes on the language, use visual aids to help us understand it, work in teams, use technology to assist us, and seek feedback from native speakers to clarify any aspects of the language that we find confusing or difficult to understand.\n\nIn addition to studying the language, we should also develop a deep understanding of the culture of the species whose language we are learning. This will help us understand the language in context and better communicate with extra-terrestrial beings.\n\nIn conclusion, interplanetary linguistics is a challenging and exciting field requiring specialized strategies and techniques to study extra-terrestrial species' languages successfully. By applying the principles and procedures outlined in this manual, we can effectively learn the language and develop accurate representations of the aspectual system. With the development of this field, we can further understand the communication between different species and potentially even form interplanetary alliances.",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI have a feeling one reason for the disappearance of the “thou” form is that the associated verb conjugation has too many syllables.  In many verbs you have to add an extra syllable or an extra consonant cluster which makes it awkward to pronounce.  For example “you create” has 2 syllables but “thou createst” has 3.  “Thou didst” has a consonant cluster at the end that “you did” does not.  The consonant cluster problem is even worse in the past tense - “you hoped” becomes “thou hoped(e)st.  \n\nThis also applies to the third person singular present tense -th archaic ending.  In many cases using the -s form saves space as well.  “He runs” - the verb has only 4 letters, but “he runneth” has 7 letters.  \n\nDo you think my assumption might be right? Thou and the -th third person ending fell out partially because they were awkward to pronounce and had too many syllables or consonant clusters.",

        "text": "Ironic semantics. I need to know what the word 'miscommunication' means, and if I used it in/correctly. First timer, so hopefully this is the right place to post? Let me know if it's not!\n\n**Context:** Basically, a colleague sent an email with a draft doc that needed to be printed, amended if necessary, signed and dated within a 24-hour period (for context: this is an acknowledged super tight turn around for my job). Amendments needed to be made, but I misread the email and amended on the electronic doc first, printed, signed and dated it. Moving forward, we discussed my error and they told me to do it on the paper like the email said, and I simply said \"I'll get those changes made now, it must have just been the tight turn around and *a miscommunication*\". I said this as a reason for why I made the errors, as in the turn around was tight and so I skimmed through the email to get started on the doc, hence the miscommunication on my end. This word really must have triggered them and they responded with \"No, there was no miscommunication, the email was clear\". \n\n**The Word:** While I think 'misunderstanding' would have been a better word to use here, I've always thought that the word 'miscommunication' could be applied to the giver AND / OR the receiver, the latter of which I was referring to as myself in this situation. However, I think my colleague thinks I was implying their email wasn't clear and the miscommunication error was on them? So I've since googled the word and, tbh, a lot of definitions read along the lines of: \"**failure to communicate clearly\"**, which totally sounds like the giver's fault? But then I go to some examples and while most put the onus on the giver, there are a few that imply it can go both/either way? No *clear, direct* answer though.\n\nSo what's the go? Can a 'miscommunication' be on *just the receiver*? Or both/just the giver? 'Misunderstanding' would be better for just the receiver, but then isn't a misunderstanding just a form of miscommunication as well? I'm so confused now. Did I use it wrong here or is it one of those *'it kinda fits, but not really'* things?",

At least, that’s the conclusion I’ve come to.\n\nThe thing that confuses me is how did abjads and abugidas form in history. What made people stop writing vowels or start marking them with diacritics?

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nThis has been on my mind for a while now. If you take a look at the \"regular\" IPA vowel chart, you can see that each vowel is articulated in its own place in the mouth. That being said, when going more in depth into the phonology of a language, one may notice that some vowels on IPA charts are very far from what one would think is their regular place of articulation. \n\nFor instance, in the following pictures (the Northern Standard Dutch vowel chart and the reference vowel chart respectively), you can see that the \\[y:\\] sound (among other rather significantly \"displaced\" vowels) is quite far from its reference point and is waaaay closer to being a \\[ʉ:\\] sound, yet it's not referred to that way. Why is that the case?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eh02fy0a3nja1.png?width=1832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a10a115a9842be35a5e7a3b9441b792f23b6db4f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhi0wy0a3nja1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f7b334db11f3b7bb2822249d020521ad54cd1bbe",
