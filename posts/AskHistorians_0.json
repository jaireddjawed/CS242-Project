The manifesto was written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Not only the manifesto was written by the pair, but multiple other literary works were written by them. Even after Karl Marx’s death, Engels continued to write and improve upon their previous works, an example being how he wrote the second and third draft of Das Kapital, and later released the fourth volume of it. You might expect that both of them would get equal recognition, right? Well, at least in my eyes, the only person I ever hear about is Marx. Why is this? Why does Marx always get mentioned, while Engels is almost never spoken of? Did Marx do most of the writing? Was Marx the one who came up with most of the books? Or am I just an oblivious buffoon?",

        "text": "Something occurred to me as I was reading about revolutions in history.\n\nThe common narrative is that Tyranny and unjust rulership causes revolution. That unless you set down your power peacefully, you will face revolt.\n\nThe problem is... the history completely disagrees with this narrative, as far as I can tell. In fact, History seems to disagree with literally everything we popularly hear about revolution and Liberal democracy in general. Yeah the Holocaust, Holodormr and 'Great Leap Forward' all occurred under autocrats, but when France showed up in Africa, it had already transitioned away from monarchy.\n\nGenocide isn't unique either, considering what the US did to the Native Americans. And mind you candidates weren't hiding their 'pro-removal' policies, they platformed on them.\n\nI mean, how many nations at the council of Berlin were even autocracies at that point?\n\nPolitical Violence? Ever hear of 'Bleeding Kansas'? Labor camps? Neo-slavery and the *modern* US prison system. Imperialism? Not even close. War? You've gotta be kidding me. Poverty and wealth inequality? That's basically just a question of economics, and as much as liberals have tried to take ownership of capitalism... no.\n\nSo if I'm an Autocrat, liberalization doesn't seem to really increase quality of life. It doesn't prevent incompetent or morally reprehensible leaders. None of it. And beyond that, there seems to be a really good chance it will actually *provoke* a revolution that results in an egotistical dictator hell bent on world domination. It's happened at least three times at least. Once is happenstance. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a pattern.\n\nMore importantly, how many have actually survived the process?\n\n1. Every single revolution occurs under inept leaders, not tyrants. It seems to me like a lot of revolutions involve people working themselves up into a fury, showing up at the Autocrat's doorstep and said autocrat just... surrenders\n2. Revolutions tend to engage in unnecessary killings. They don't want you deposed, they want you and your entire family dead. If you try to run, they will hunt you down and murder you without a trial in the streets- democratically of course\n3. For all the bluster about tyrants, it seems like revolutions most commonly happen when Autocrats start liberalizing. Alexander II, Louis XVI, Ghadafi, the list goes on. I've never actually heard of a revolution that occurred under a competent Tyrant, only incompetent ones, or ones in the process of setting down their power\n4. Revolution pretty universally results in an unstable system that ends up revolving around a single person. And how well things turn out tend to rely on how gracious that person turns out to be. Despite the fact it wasn't so much a revolution as it was a revolt, the American Revolution still ended with people ready to call George Washington a king despite, you know, everything.\n\nI think the reason we think these things about revolution is propaganda from the new regime. It's sort of universally true that Usurpers will say anything and everything to justify their rule. Ask them and the previous regime was incompetent, cruel, disfavored by the heavens, a literal bastard, pedophilic, held foreign sympathies, easily seduced, impotent, a puppet, petty, consumed by jealousy, practiced black magic, sought the council of women or was otherwise controlled by a woman, and was probably gay too.\n\nUltimately, I think revolutions tend to start in rather dogmatic thought, and get hijacked by power-hungry individuals looking to take advantage of the situation. Anarchists and communists are fond of saying that the rich will never vote away their power and wealth, despite the wealthy and powerful often being behind land redistribution reforms, or freeing peasants, or transitioning away from mercantilism to a capitalist one, or even writing the *Communist Manifesto*.\n\nIn the end, I just see no real reason for an autocrat to liberalize. Like, it's not even necessarily going to result in a better country. You really do have to shut down dissent, because people totally will drag you out into the streets and beat you to death in a rabid riot because they are easily misled.\n\nSo the question is this: am I wrong? How wrong am I? Whether I am right or wrong, can you give me some reading material on this subject in general?",

        "text": "History has shown time and time again that monarchies are extremely problematic and inefficient forms of government. In order for a monarchical government to function, there needs to be a clear line of succession within the ruler's family. Even the slightest of complications in the inheritance plans can (and often has) thrown their nation into shambles.\n\nThe sample of available heirs (and in extension, the nation’s political stability) is also dependent on the ruler's family size and relationship dynamics. If the ruler's family is too large, then there are too many competing heirs that often end up squabbling amongst themselves for power. Such infighting commonly escalate into civil wars that wind up tearing their nation apart.\n\nOn the other hand, if the ruler's family is too small, then the line of succession can easily be compromised by any sort of unforeseeable circumstances. In other words, if a ruler has a small family, their heirs cannot easily be replaced if they wind up dying prematurely. This problem is exacerbated if the deceased heirs pass away before they’re able to continue on the family line. If there are survivors available, they might be unfit to rule. As there isn’t a clear succession plan, the nation’s future is uncertain, and is very likely going to be thrown into a power vacuum.\n\nSometimes both of those scenarios feed into each other. I’ve heard of stories of victorious heirs purging their own relatives to eliminate rivals, and then being murdered themselves by other enemies. Thus leaving very few (if any) survivors of a ruling family.\n\nDespite these problems, historically speaking, monarchies can be found all across the globe. Cultures as diverse as the Sumerians, Mayans, Fijians, Medieval Europeans, Chinese, Zulus, etc. all used there for their government systems. Why is despite how fragile monarchies tend to be, they are so commonly found throughout world history?",

The general histories I've read have left me with so many questions. \n\nFor example, I'm confused about how much of an innovator Napoleon was in terms of organization. Some sources seen to place a lot of stock in Napoleon reshaping the army. Others suggest he more or less inherited an already significantly reformed army, courtesy of the Ancien Régime and M. Carnot.\n\nI enjoy the Napoleonic Quarterly podcast, which often has interviews with Rafe Blaufarb. Would his book, The French Army 1750-1820, be a good starting point?\n\nI've also come across Lynn's The Bayonets Of the Republic. It seems very detailed, but it was first published in 1984 (I think). I'm not sure whether there's more recent scholarship I should be looking at.\n\nMany thanks!",
