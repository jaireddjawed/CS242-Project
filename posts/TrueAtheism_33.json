Any help from you guys would be appreciated.\n\nI guess what I'm most interesting in learning about are inconsistencies in the Bible (and with the Christian religion as a whole - like, any history that doesn't add up), philosophical arguments against Christianity, scientific arguments, etc. \n\nI know I'm being pretty broad here, so I'm sorry if that's a problem! I just want to learn more. I'm planning on posting a similar question in the Christianity subreddit about the same stuff, in argument *for* Christianity.\n\nI just want to feel that my beliefs are true, whether they be religious or not.

        "text": "Throughout my life I've had severe asthma and allergies that have led to some very close brushes with death, including having my heart stop, my breathing stop, and times when I was consciously awake but unable to see due to lack of oxygen. \n\nYesterday I ate some food that my body decided was a foreign invader in need of eradication. At one point, I was lying in bed, aware that my vision was starting to go, breathing was extremely painful, covered in red urticaria. I decided that I had just enough strength left to get my epi-pen and call 911, or get my handgun and kill myself. If I chose to do nothing, I was certain I would die in agony anyway. I spent several minutes debating the pros and cons of each decision as my vision began to wane. When I stood up, I found I didn't have enough strength left, and chose to call 911 and work to live. That I am typing this, is evidence that I've of course, survived the trauma.\n\nThroughout my life I've dealt with PTSD from such experiences. These near death experiences have given me an outlook on life that is very different from the thoughts of others. I've often felt estranged for my different ways of thinking. In my early years, I attributed these views to the religion I was raised in. However, it wasn't until a college psychology course that covered Maslow's own near death experience and subsequent research that I came to realize that in fact my altered views were a product of these near death experiences, not due to my religious upbringing. \n\nI just wanted to get this out into the world. I'm looking for a good therapist to help me cope with this recent suffering, but I am also happy for the many opporunities for joy and experience that I will still have, being alive. ",

        "author": "ebagslolz",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/301hnr/coming_out_as_an_atheist/",
        "text": "I recently “came out” as an agnostic atheist, and a few folks have asked about what that means and why I have chosen it as a worldview. I thought an explainer thing might be helpful. I hope you find it worth reading completely:\n\nFirst, let’s get the obvious out of the way: I’m an agnostic atheist. Agnostic is a statement about knowledge, and atheist is a statement about belief. When it comes to knowledge of god, you can be agnostic (unsure) or gnostic (sure). Before I get into the why, I wanted to provide a primer on the terminology used.\n\nWhen it comes to beliefs about god, people can be a few things, including atheist, deist, and theist. Atheists do not believe that a god or gods intervene in the world. Deists believe that god started the universe, but does not intervene today. Theists believe in a god (or gods) that intervene in the world on a regular basis. They might answer prayers, or send rain, etc.\n\nSo, taken together: agnostic atheist - one who isn’t sure about the existence of god or gods, and carries on life as though one doesn’t exist. A lot of my friends are gnostic theists: they know a god (or gods) exist, and believe they regularly intervene in the world. Most people following a monotheistic religion (Sikhism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc.) fall into this category. I believe many of them are actually closeted agnostic theists. For reference, a gnostic atheist would say they know there is no god or gods.\n\nThe next question is usually: how did you end up there? That’s an interesting question, I think, for anyone to consider. How did you end up believing what you believe? Did your parents believe the same things you do? Do you believe it because that’s what was around when you were young? Was it the dominant religion of your area or country? Did you experience something you couldn’t explain?\n\nGrowing up, my main religious experiences revolved around weddings, funerals, and Christmas concerts. I’ve never felt a true affinity for religion, though I have made earnest attempts. I’ve always been curious about the concept of religion, though, and that’s where my journey started. Curiosity.\n\nSo how did I land there? For now, I’ll skip these difficult questions: why is there suffering? Why was Jesus tortured? Why didn’t God stop the 2004 Tsunami from wiping out hundreds of thousands of people?  Why doesn’t a god take away cancer, or get rid of Alzheimer’s? Why are there birth defects where babies live only a few days and then die? What happens to aborted and stillborn babies? What divine value might those children have? What the hell was up with the holocaust??  Forget those for now. All difficult questions for anyone to answer no matter what they believe.\n\nSo evolution: I know (am gnostic) that evolution is a thing that happens, and we are a product of it. Given the mountain of evidence in favor of evolution, I am convinced.  This means is that I know we evolved from earlier primates, over a long period of time. Like a really, really long  time. That’s all. Do you agree with that? If you are okay with that conceptually (or gnostically), keep on reading:\n\nPrimates other than us still exist today, so we can study them in the wild. Primates murder, just like us. They’re so much like us in so many ways, we even use them to test the drugs that hold the most promise to save us from our own sufferings. They love, and hate. They fear. Their birth defects are the same as those that affect our children.  One notable difference: other primates don’t commit suicide. There’s no compelling evidence of that. We share 98.7% of our DNA with bonobo monkeys. We share 99.9% of our DNA with every other person alive today on the planet. And 50% of our DNA with bananas.\n\nSo we evolved from earlier primates, and we are like existing primates in a lot of ways. We evolved from that state, to become aware of our reality in a way that they are not able. Unlike almost every other creature on the planet, we have the ability to assess ourselves as a “self.” We can communicate with methods they’re incapable of even conceiving. That little bit of genetic difference is pretty important!\n\n\nPrimates, due to the slim difference in our genetic code, and despite the fact that we evolved from creatures much like them, cannot fathom the concept of “god.” Their intelligence does not allow them to grasp concepts like divinity, though there is evidence to suggest they can have “spiritual experiences”.\n\nOk, so I’m done linking us to other primates, at this point. They’re pretty much the same as us. They suffer in a lot of the same ways, and experience reality - the way they physically perceive it (hot/cold, colors, etc.) - in much the same way we do. They do not have the ability to conceive a god or gods. Do you believe that?\n\nIf we evolved from primates with similar mental faculties (by and large), and similar methods of experiencing reality (sight, sound, etc.), then we too, at one time, did not conceive of a god or gods. We came into our ability to grasp concepts like divinity, religion, mortality, mourning, and purpose over the course of many millenia.\n\nFor 100,000 years, we (meaning anatomically modern homo sapiens sapiens) have buried our dead. Maybe that’s a loose definition of “religion,” so here are a few other dates to consider. A 30,000 year-old worshipping place was found in Botswana (maybe). Pharaoh Djoser commissioned the oldest surviving Egyptian pyramid about 4,600 years ago. If Moses existed, he was present around 3,400 years ago. Jesus probably lived about 2000 years ago. Evidently, neanderthals also demonstrated some form of religion, when they were co-habitating parts of Africa with us.\n\nIt stands, therefore, that religion, in even the loosest sense, has been something that has only occurred for 50% or less of the entire history of our species, and modern religions (those still in practice today in various configurations) aren’t much more than 3,000 years old. Most of the religions in the history of our species are now extinct, or nearly so. \n\nI’ll bet you’re gnostic about Zeus not existing. You’re an atheist about Zeus too, right? Every piece of archeological evidence from around the world, chronicles the evolution of the beliefs of our species. From Botswana, to The Vatican. Religion as a concept is an artifact of the cultural and social journey of our species, not our genetics. This includes our modern identifications of a god or gods.\n\nNow we can talk about those questions: suffering is a byproduct of the combination of our intellect (our ability to conceive “suffering”) and all that that allows (greed, the scientific method, space shuttles, etc.), and our environment, which we now adapt to our needs. I think we can improve how we use our intellect to affect suffering, and how we adapt our environment.\n\nJesus didn’t have to suffer. I think it’s likely that there was a historical Jesus, though it’s unclear whether the crucifixion took place or not. People torturing, maiming, and killing people because of religious beliefs is something still happening today.\n\nGod didn’t stop the 2004 tsunami from killing an estimated 230,000 people and displacing about 1.75 million more, because there isn’t one (or any). The forces that drive our planet cause earthquakes and tsunamis, and they are devastating. How much suffering did that one event cause, globally?\n\nThe answer to the rest of those questions is all pure suffering. Suffering then, and more specifically it’s reduction, is where our attention should focus. Suffering for as many members of our species should be reduced. Some people may choose to extend that to other conscious creatures. We can figure out how later. We don’t need a god or gods to help. But we do have to work together, no matter what we believe.\n\nI think that’s where I’ll close this. I hope that was easy to follow, and not offensive. I hope I’ve provided a respectful perspective, and would appreciate respectful replies. If you have any questions, please let me know. I’d be glad to have conversations with anyone on this topic.",

        "text": "I just turned 18 a few weeks ago and with it I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am atheistic, yet I belong to an incredibly religious family and I am their only child. My parents are wonderful, kind, supportive people but the only thing they love more than me is God. My friends are great as well, but they are all incredibly devout and God-fearing and even though I have pretended to be like them for years I just don't feel it. My community is full of incredibly kind people who use religion in a good way. I love my family and my friends and my life and my community but I can no longer blindly accept spirituality.\nI have been in hell for the last five years as I have begun my slow and torturous descent into atheism. I have tried so hard to suppress my true feelings, my doubts, my frustrations with faith but I always came back to the fact that I was a skeptic who could not blindly accept the fundamental idea of God. \nHeck, my whole decline started when I first read the Bible cover to cover and realized all the horrible things \"men of God\" whom I had always been taught to mindlessly adulate had really done. In Samuel King Saul is asked to kill all the men, women, children, and animals of a rival people. Saul obeys and slaughters thousands of innocents (many children) and is only repremanded because he didn't kill anyone. I couldn't accept that God would not only condone, but promote genocide. I came to the conclusion that if God asked me to murder an innocent baby just because he was born a pagan, I would refuse and take any damnation that came my way. The things that \"God\" asked people to do were horrific and went against everything I thought Christianity was supposed to represent. The killing of the firstborn? The condoning of rape if the women doesn't scream loud enough? The hatred for people who don't believe in the same God as you do despite the fact that they had never even heard of your God and were brought up in much of the same way as you to believe their religion is right? If anyone who didn't follow my particular brand of Christianity was a sinner doomed to Hell, how was that fair to people who never even heard of your God? How was it fair to those brought up to believe deviating from their chosen faith would send them to eternal damnation? How could a supposedly benevolent God have so much hatred?\nWhen I first asked these questions in a more subtle way, I was immediately denied any answers. \"Don't overthink everything. Is any of this making you happier or more fulfilled? Some things about the Bible and God we can't understand. What we need to do is to live righteously ourselves and not worry about the details.\"\nThe same thing happened when I  put forward my skepticism on creationism. While my church was not expressly anti-science, we did take the Bible as fact. I loved science and astronomy and I was fascinated by the history of Earth and the universe. I loved watching documentaries on Stephen Hawking and dinosaurs but when my parents saw me doing this they said it was filling my head with nonsense so I did it in secret. \nI first stopped believing in God on an intellectual and logical level, but it took longer to get over it on an emotional level. Everyone I knew LOVED God. Every Wednesday we would have a church service and dozens of people would be lining up and be literally weeping because they were filled with so much joy and purpose and love for God. My mother always talked of answered prayers and blessings and how she could feel God guiding her, yet I felt nothing, only confusion and self-loathing because I didn't get it. I pretended I did, of course, but at the end of the day I could not accept it. I tried so hard to find God, to believe and have faith, but I couldn't rationalize God with reason, that God was Love even when everything about theology pointed to God as Hatred. Without spirituality providing an emotional connection, my belief in God withered away until I was just a husk of a religious person who stood and clapped and said \"Praise God!\" but silently agonized over the fact that the beliefs I had grown up with made no sense.\nI think there are parts of Christianity I really like. I love Jesus and his teachings of loving the poor and helpless and being kind to them, of turning the other cheek and giving selflessly. But do I believe he is the Son of God? No. I can't.\n\nI'm sorry this is so long, but I have never been allowed to say it. If my family knew... well it would hurt them really badly. Other kids in my church have left before and I have seen how it kills their parents and friends who believe the kid is doomed to Hell and that they failed in raising a righteous soldier of Christ. I don't want to cause anyone pain, especially the people I love but I have no one I can talk to. Every day I wear the mask of a perfect Christian girl but it is all a lie. How can I live my life this way? I wish someone could help me understand how to stop lying and be myself without causing unimaginable pain for those I care about. \nMaybe I can't. Maybe it would be best to continue the repression of my doubt and go on masquerading as an angel of light so I don't hurt people.\nI'm sorry for all the melodrama. I just need some help.\n",

        "text": "Just to clarify, here is how I define the terms.\n\nAtheism - No belief in God as defined in Judeo-Christianity or Islam.  The belief that an all powerful, all good, all knowing deity is not logically possible. \n\nSpirituality - The belief that after we die, everything that we are not disappear from reality.  That a piece of us that defines who we are continues to exist, grow, learn and change.\n\nI've been an atheist for 20 years or so and initially I felt that when we die there is nothing.  I'm not sure why but I don't feel that way anymore.  It could be working as a hospice doctor and going through that training.  It could be learning about other belief systems I didn't consider when I initially became an atheist, like Buddhism.  It could be learning about other phenomenon I wouldn't have thought possible, like how quantum mechanics operate.  It could be a period where I spent alot of time meditating.  Its probably a combination of all of the above.\n\nIn any case, I'm just curious how many other people out there consider themselves both spiritual and atheist.  Alot of atheists have told me that it is impossible to be both.  \n\nEdit - Thanks for the responses.  They are both intelligent and strangely reassuring.",

        "text": "I am new to Reddit and so new to r/TrueAtheism. Living in an area where almost everyone seems to engage in a passive acceptance of Christianity (Ireland) I'm excited to find a place where I can have discussions with people whose views on god differ from those which I am surrounded by. However I find there are numerous lexical gaps for describing non-theistic beliefs. It could be that growing up in Ireland I haven't encountered words that are in wide-spread use in more multi-cultural parts of the world, or it could be that as non-theistic beliefs weren't accepted for most of western history, a proper main stream vocabulary for these beliefs never evolved. In the case of the former please educate me, in the case of the latter we might want to start filling in the lexical gaps. \n\nTo illustrate my point I may have to use words like \"Belief\" that can mean different things to different people. To avoid confusion I'll define certain words for the sake of my illustration. I'm not saying the definition I give is the correct or the only definition. However it is the definition I'll use. So;\n\nTheism: The belief in one or more gods/deities/divine beings\n\nAtheism: The belief that there are no gods/deities/divine beings\n\nAgnosticism: The belief that one cannot be certain as to the existence of gods/deities/divine beings\n\nSupernatural: Something whose existence is inherently/by definition, illogical. Neither theistic, atheistic nor agnostic beliefs are mutually exclusive with, nor necessarily involving supernatural beliefs.\n\nBelief: Something a person considers true.\n\nFaith: A belief or collection of beliefs that, according to the person who has those beliefs, are based upon an unquestioning acceptance of said beliefs. \n\nKnowledge: A belief that is true. Of course, a person in possession of knowledge would have no way of realising this as they think all their beliefs are true and therefore couldn't differentiate between the knowledge and the rest. \n\nI have matched these words with these definitions because I feel it is what they are commonly understood to mean and/or because it is how I understand them.\n\nSo my concern is that there are considerable lexical gaps when it comes to describing non-theistic beliefs. This is a problem because it leads to people hijacking words that already have a meaning and giving it an additional meaning, resulting in ambiguous and inexact terminology. It is also a problem because it leads to people not being able to express how they feel, and having to describe themselves using words that misrepresent their beliefs. I find myself in this position. As a child I oscillated between theism and atheism until eventually I decided that logic was the best tool for uncovering the truth. Following this was a purge of all my supernatural beliefs, leaving me agnostic. I accepted agnosticism as I thought “well, we have no way of proving or disproving the existence of some kind of god, and god (unlike say, a teapot in orbit around mars) is such an unspecific and vaguely defined concept, open to interpretation and differing across various theologies, that there may be some particular idea of god that resembles the truth in some strange way.” So I decided to be agnostic and didn’t think much more about it.\nUntil that is, I read The God Delusion. Dawkins’ definition of an atheist seemed to be anyone who A) rejected ideas of the supernatural and B) was sufficiently unconvinced by any of the existing theologies that they would consider living their lives according a particular religion pointless (I’ll refer to this kind of atheism as Dawkins-atheism).  I realised that according to Dawkins’ definition I was indeed an atheist. But even Dawkins admitted that technically speaking an atheist was someone who believed there was no god, not some who thought it terribly unlikely that any of the gods thus far conceived of by humanity were real.  I have also come to realise that a lot of people call themselves atheist, or get called atheist despite actually being a Dawkins-atheist. Atheism and Dawkins-atheism are similar but distinct from one another. \nIs this a problem? Yes, I think so. Now when someone says to me they’re an atheist I don’t know whether they’re referring to Dawkins-atheism or atheism. The word has been hijacked and become ambiguous in its meaning. And I’m not the only one who gets confused over the ambiguity of the word. One of the most wide-spread arguments I’ve heard against atheism is: “Where is your evidence that there is absolutely defiantly not god whatsoever, how can you prove that for sure? Your belief is as much a faith as my own.” This of course is not a good refutation of Dawkins-atheism, but it makes the arguer feel as though they have refuted atheism in all its forms because they are not aware of Dawkins-atheism (they might be if we had a word for it). The reason I think a lot of Dawkins-atheists call themselves atheists is because Dawkins-atheism and atheism are, on the surface of it, similar. Even though technically agnostic is the correct terminology to describe a Dawkins-atheist, it feels like a greater misrepresentation of the Dawkins-atheist’s beliefs than referring to themselves as an atheist. Saying “I’m agnostic” makes it sound as though one thinks there’s a good 50% chance that the God of the bible, or koran, or whatever the local deity happens to be, is indeed the true God (I’ll call this kind of agnostic the Archetype-agnostic i.e. The agnostic who believes that the religion of their upbringing and all its strange details may very-well be true, but they’re just not sure). The reality of the situation is that most Dawkins-atheists don’t feel this way at all, and in effect their attitude towards the bible probably has more in common with the attitude of an atheist towards the bible than it does with the Archetype-agnostic. So, even though both the Dawkins-atheist and the Archetype-agnostic are indeed agnostic, the Dawkins-atheist calls themselves atheist anyway because their beliefs are nothing like that of the Archetype-agnostic, and thus feel like calling themselves an agnostic would misrepresent their beliefs more than calling themselves an atheist. This is certainly how I as a Dawkins-atheist feel.\nThis is only one example of the problems caused by an insufficient vocabulary for the various kinds of non-theistic beliefs. I think the fact that I had to resort to making up terms like “Dawkins-atheist” and “Archetype-agnostic” is in and of itself proof that we could do with an extended and more nuanced vocabulary. There may be some who think we can’t just make up new words, but frankly I think we can as long as the words A) are precisely defined B) Have a useful application (If there were a word for the belief that an elite gang of bronys secretly control the world, then despite having a precise definition, it still wouldn't make a good word as no one actually believes that, so it lacks useful application) and C) is well constructed. My word Dawkins-atheist is rather clumsily put together. Although it had a precise definition and a useful application the word itself is terrible. It is composed of two smaller words; Dawkins and atheist. Atheist could cause confusion because Dawkins-atheist refers to a kind of agnosticism, not atheism. And Dawkins could cause confusion because Dawkins exact views on atheism are open to interpretation. Also the word is hyphenated. For these reasons Dawkins-atheist is not that good of a word. Steering away from word construction for a bit, is a group of people making up new words (or appropriating old words) for the purpose of describing a specific aspect of their identity unprecedented? No it isn’t. There used to be only two genders, man and woman, now there’s a whole load of them, thanks to people making up words for the purpose of better describing a specific aspect of their identity. People come up with words to describe fetishes, sexual orientations and all sorts of things there usen’t be words for. This had to happen I think, because in the past, these aspects of people’s identities, like non-theistic beliefs, were frowned upon in the west and not talked about, and so western languages like English ended up without a sufficiently encompassing vocabulary for these things. I don’t see why we, like the folk of non-traditional sexuality, shouldn’t attempt to create an encompassing vocabulary. It could result in better and more nuanced conversations about these matters and would allow us to properly represent our beliefs. \n\nWow, I wrote more than I expected to. I suppose that’s what happens when you suddenly have the opportunity to talk about your beliefs. Anyway, thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: Formatting \n",

However there are those people that think this type of behaviour is is justified and necessary. When asked why they hold that particular view you will will often get the reply 'because God has commanded that those who do not believe in them be killed and since it is God that has given the command then it is righteous and just'. Even if you were to explain why doing such things is immoral they might reply with 'well thats what you think but we will value and hold true what the all knowing and all powerful creator of the universe sees as right or wrong'. So if you think killing innocent people is wrong but God thinks it is right then killing innocent people is right. Note this does not just apply to Islam but to any religion that justifies atrocities because God says it is okay to do so.\n\nMy question is how would you deal with someone who sees morality in this framework ? or is it just completely impossible to convince them otherwise ?",

It goes far deeper than silly church billboards, so that's why I'm posting here instead of r/atheism, which seems to make its sustenance off quotes, memes, pics, links...etc. \n\nMillions of Americans literally believe that the creator of the universe is going to call curtains on the human enterprise within their lifetime. Not only that, but they believe that celestial events (comets, the solar eclipse yesterday, etc.) are all *directed* at humans on this planet--more specifically at Israel. My parents' church even puts out a \"prophecy\" magazine designed to rile people up with fear-mongering and tenuous links between revelation and modern day events (which are all curiously mentioned only in hindsight). \n\nThere is plenty of talk on how ridiculous these ideologies are in regard to what they think about the past, but there is not enough talk on this subreddit or in secular discourse in general about the eschatological trend. This shit is frightening because it not only seems to compromise a person's critical thinking capacities, but their empathy and decency as well. War is welcomed. It is foretold, after all. Any disaster or crime against humanity is embraced as eschatological confirmation, and meanwhile love, vision, and any sane discussion on how to evolve our society are left by the wayside. \n\nThis nonsense is what really excites the indoctrinated zealot (the kind I'm familiar with). Creationism and the crucifixion are mere appetizers for these people. End Times chaos is their main course and their dessert, and the priestly casts of people in charge of these local churches have made this a living reality for them. \n\nAll sorts of squirrelly beliefs about our world's past are tolerated without much mockery and without consequence. Yet lone individuals who are delusional about the *present* and the *near-future* are often submitted for psychiatric care. For example, most people don't think holocaust-deniers should be put on meds. However, if a person believes he is Elvis or that aliens are planning a human-harvest for next year, a doctor is likely to prescribe some Thorazine. While I'm not suggesting that end timers be locked away or anything draconian/authoritarian like that, I am suggesting that more weight of discourse be put on these eschatological ideas in particular so that society may begin to recognize the *collective* mental illness that is currently eroding sanity in the South (and elsewhere).",

I'm surrounded by a generation of peers (I'm 30) that don't give Christianity (nevermind other religions) another thought, while the generation before me is filled mostly with religious, and dutiful church goers.  I'm sure many of you are in similar boats.\n\nWe've all seen and read the decades of information about why religion is in the decline, but I've never been totally satisfied with them.  But what if, what if the bible is too boring to hold someones attention anymore.  Until recently, the bible was the most readily available source of entertainment available.  Imagine your at home on a cold rainy day in 1842, animals all feed that morning, house is picked up.  Radio and television are nearly a century away.  Perhaps there are a few books on the shelf, but this is a time before Charles Dickens has even wrote a Christmas carol.  What's going to be on the shelf then?  A few early readers for the young kids, a world history book maybe, and the bible.  There's already an entire day of the week and possibly several buildings in town directly related to the bible in that world.  I think, in a low information culture, established religions are a shoe-in with a captive audience just by virtue of a lack of anything else to do.\n\nGranted this in not a revelation, but what I think has happened is, the generations of the last century have had access to so much more information that the slow tedious teachings of the bible have been drowned out by the information age.  When I'm 45-50, and the youth are two generations removed from habitual church goers, I think that they aren't even going to get what religion is supposed to be for or about.\n\nEDIT:  Lots of good discussion was generated!  Let me say, I absolutely consider the bible a keystone to our cultural history.  And beyond that, it contains a lot of valuable poetry and historical information.  But people in western culture we can now learn about it and move on to other interests, where before they may have suffered from over analysis because on to pour over it again and again, re-interpreted constantly, and analysed to death.  That's where denominations came from for the most part I think, one community putting more focus on one part over another.  Think about this, why did we get \"gays are bad\" instead of \"wine is better than water\" as a core belief in modern Christianity?  Turning water to wine is Jesus's first miracle, it was a big deal that party he was at going to die down, so Jesus secretly made more wine and then told his buddies not to tell anyone he did it.  If that's not an endorsement for party hardy, then I don't know what is!",

When I asked him who specifically he did not want to answer. It has me worried that I will be forced to sit through a funerary service more dedicated to advancing a religion than honoring my Father's life. Mormons are famous for this, and they even have instruction to emphasize funerals as \"missionary and teaching opportunities\". As a result, I have seen many disgraceful funerals and memorial services that do not even honor the deceased. My parents are great people, and neither of them deserve that.\n\nSo here is my question. Is it even worth contending or discussing? Part of me wonders if I should let it go because after all it is their funeral, but part of me also feels that the funeral is for the memory of the deceased and their family.  \n\nI am the oldest child and responsible for most decisions (i.e if they are a vegetable, the estate etc. etc.) but there are some things they feel I am not able to handle anymore for not being religious. \n\nThoughts? \n\nEdit : thanks for the input, probably going to leave it be as suggested.

I am hesitant to call myself an atheist around people because while I don't believe or follow religion I don't necessarily believe there isn't a God, but I definitely don't believe it is a God that is outlined in the likes of Christianity/Islam and the like.. I think of God as the universe we live in, an unknowable and incomprehensible  (from a human perspective) intelligence and force, it is everything and anything and has no central intelligence like God seems to have in most religions, it has many view points throughout life that lives inside of it.\n\nI also don't think we are all separate, meaningless animals like (some aspects) of atheism describe us as being, when we die it's nothing forever and there is no inherent meaning to life.. I believe while our consciousness as that singular life form may end we are still a part of a never ending infinite reality and that can never die, so in a way we never really die.. humans perceive and understand this universe by separating everything into groups and classifications, seeing everything as separate when I believe in fact it is all one, completely connected.. I would say the meaning of life is the meaning you as a singular consciousness inside this vast infinite reality come to give yourself.\n\nI am terrible at articulating my beliefs in words so I hope what I have said makes sense, but would you guys classify me as an atheist because I don't believe in religions or a single consciousness sort of God? Is there a school of thought that is similar to what I believe or are my beliefs unique to me personally for the most part?\n\nIf anyone is interested I have formed my perception of reality through meditation, study, using mind altering substances and just generally \"feeling\" this to be true as silly and unscientific as that may sound.\n\nThanks for any help you guys can give on giving me a label haha, I know it isn't important but when people ask me what I believe I struggle to articulate it without going into depth and sounding like a bit of a weirdo to people who are cut and dry hard believers and rarely think about this sort of stuff in depth or full on atheists, I've only ever come across a handful of people in my life who have ever had similar beliefs to me and have understood me when I discussed my perception of reality with them.",

        "text": "I personally find no value being an atheist.  There might be some good in me being an atheist such as the fact that I do not have to live by religious morals and such.  But the more important life to me that I personally deem as the greatest life would be a life of eternal bliss and no suffering.  Atheism does not offer such a deluded comforting and empowering belief in an afterlife of eternal joy and no suffering.  Therefore, me being an atheist does not work out for me at all.\n\nThe whole rule (concept) of life that states that \"Chasing after pleasure will only lead to suffering\"  needs to be changed.  I wish to change that rule to \"Chasing after pleasure will lead to a blissful life of paradise.\"  I also wish to create a new rule of life that says that \"Non-acceptance of your suffering and mortality will allow you to fully regain the dominance, power, and control in your life that you wanted.  You can choose to not accept your suffering and mortality and just take a cure for it and all your suffering and mortality will be gone.\"   I wish to encourage people to find cures for suffering, mortality, and absence of pleasure (anhedonia and depression) through my writing.  This is because this life to me is meant to be a blissful life of eternal paradise.  We are all human beings of immense value and we deserve such a life.  Anyone who dare say that we do not deserve such a life or that we are not entitled to such a life are only demeaning themselves and the values of others.  They are denying and restricting their own personal value as a human being as well as the value of others. \n\nTo say that we are not entitled/worthy of such a blissful eternal life is a demeaning and insulting act in of itself.  It would be no different than if an innocent person was suffering, came up to you while begging for a blissful life and freedom from his/her suffering, and for you to tell him/her that he/she does not deserve such a life, that he/she is not entitled to such a life, that he/she should just \"deal with it,\" and/or that \"this life doesn't owe us anything.\"  Of course, it is a scientific fact that this life doesn't owe us anything.  But to use that said phrase in such a way that restricts and denies the value of other human beings is a demeaning, cruel, and insulting act.  Therefore, we should not have to suffer and to just forever remain dead in the end like rotting pieces of meat with no afterlife for us.  I personally do not believe in an afterlife since I am an atheist.  I also do not believe in anything superstitious or supernatural either.\n\nNow some would say that being in a neutral state (a state of nirvana) in which you experience neither pleasure nor suffering,that this state is better than being in a state of suffering.  But it is not what we would refer to as being better.  We would instead refer to that state as being more neutral.  This is because if we say that something is better, we are attributing good value and saying that it is more good.  But since there is nothing good about being in a neutral state of no pleasure, then we would just refer to that state as being more neutral instead.\n\nIn conclusion, I will not live to be mocked by this life of suffering and mortality.  My pleasure was taken away.  I am given great and beautiful things in this life just so I cannot experience any pleasure from them.  On top of that, I am not given an afterlife of eternal pleasure as a reward for this inferior life that I am having either.  Therefore, I refuse to ever accept such a mocking life that takes away my pleasure and then does not give me another life of pleasure as a reward.",

I have never heard a reasonable defense of free will, and I believe that \"free will\" is nothing more than a religious doctrine that is required to make sense of divine punishment and held up as a justification for the desire to punish others.\n\nI can't see how people are more than the product of their circumstances. A person is not culpable for the synapses firing in their brain any more than a computer program is culpable for errors in its programming.\n\nI am a programmer, and if a program is \"misbehaving\" I will first try to diagnose it, and then try to fix it. I don't *blame* a running process for executing instructions. Of course I might have to terminate it or cordon it off to prevent damage, but I never think that I should *punish* a program. That is preposterous.",

        "text": "Her response was, frankly, terrifying. In short, she said that 'there must be a good reason for it' because 'God called us to support them no matter what'. The conversation went a bit longer, and eventually said she would be willing to consider what it means to 'curse or bless' them and learn more about the prophecy in scripture (and whether it covers anything Israel does or allows for a nation to discipline them).\n\nThe problem I ran into was that her beliefs shaped her opinion on the matter: Palestine is occupying land promised to Israel by God, so this is self-defense. Because I don't believe in the prophecy, it caused a division that was difficult to overcome. I want to believe (perhaps naively) that my parents wouldn't be so nonchalant about genocide, but I don't know enough about that prophecy to make sense of it. Of course, they don't bat an eyelash at the idea of billions of people roasting in Hell for all eternity, so maybe genocide isn't a big deal to them.\n\nAnyways, any thoughts on how to approach this discussion? I tried to not override her beliefs, and just ask her to reconsider their meaning, but even that was met with resistance. Perhaps it's not worth it at all. If anyone's had success on this topic, I'd love to hear from you.",

I was raised Christian  but after I had my first child I took a really hard look at my faith as I didn't want to just pass something along to my child if I wasn't convinced myself. As a result, it has been a very tough year or two as I come to accept my doubts, and as they continue to grow and grow. I have resisted pursuing any sort of reading or research on the topic, mostly because I expect that my doubts will be affirmed, but it is time for me to start looking in to this further as I need to know where I stand.\n\nAt the moment, I have come to the point where I really doubt if there is a god but if there is, I would think it is really hard for me to accept that Christianity is the only way to that god, if you know what I mean. I am mad at myself for not being this analytic about this earlier in my life, but want to move forward as best as I can. Most of my close friends are Christian and I don't know where to turn for resources that will present evidence for what I search. I have told a few people around me that I am questioning/doubting, including one close Christian friend (who has been respectful and supportive), but I need support/information from the side I need to know more about. I have one friend from college who is an atheist who I am trying to set up lunch with to talk with them.\n\nI'd appreciate any information and support. I saw a post a few weeks back on here or /r/atheism about a phone line for those who are questioning their faith, but I don't seem to have saved it. I'm sure there are great websites as well, but most searches are basically just resulting in Christian sites that aren't at all providing the information I need.",

When thinking of terms of infinite, you don't even have the capability of truly knowing how huge that is. Words don't exist to truly describe it let alone the finite potential of the brain. Why would you think you even have the mind to understand it?

You both try adjusting your behaviors, values and goals around learning as much as possible about this unknowable \"thing\". It's not a bad thing to do that, it makes our existence and our decedent's existence a little more comfortable. It's engraved in out dna. We're not to blamed for that.\n\nPoor title.

We don't need a circle jerk about how bad Christians actually are.

Instead of getting bogged down in a tedious debate about the fossil record and other such technical arguments (since the vast majority of people engaging in these discussions on either side, myself included, are not paleontologists), I instead propose a counterargument based solely on logic. I’m sure such an argument has been constructed elsewhere before, but it’s something that I thought of today and just wanted to flesh it out in writing and receive some feedback. This seemed like as good a place as any to do so.\n\nYoung earth creationists and biblical literalists would agree with the general sentiment that the bible is the inerrant word of God and therefore 100% true, correct and completely devoid of error. We shall summarize this with the simple statement “if it is in the bible, then it is true.” I would then ask the biblical literalist if they agree with the converse; that is, “if it is NOT in the bible, then it is NOT true.”\n\nIf they say no and disagree with the converse statement, then we’re done. You can no longer cite the non-mention of dinosaurs in the bible as evidence of their non-existence because you just agreed that absence of mention in the bible does not necessarily equate to absence of existence in the universe.\n\nIf they say yes and agree with the converse statement, then point out that they are now stating that all knowledge in the universe, all truths, everything that exists/has existed/ever will exist is finite because the bible itself is finite. (That is until we have the Counsel of Nicea 2.0 and add more texts to the bible, but I think most Christians would not support such a counsel and we won’t go down that path now because it leads me way off topic.) Also, if they agree with the converse statement then they must reject the existence or veracity of anything that is not explicitly mentioned in the bible. To my knowledge the bible does not explicitly state that the sky is blue, or that E=MC^2 or that New York City exists. Therefore none of these things can possibly be true. Such an obvious fallacy would then hopefully lead them to reconsider their acceptance of the converse statement.\n\nI’m well aware of, and generally agree with, the statement that if you could reason with religious people there would be no religious people, and so I’m sure this argument won’t get anyone very far, but there it is nonetheless. Let me know what you think!\n\ntl;dr: if you agree with the statement that “if it is NOT in the bible then it is NOT true,” then you must also agree that New York City does not exist.\n",

The boys and girls each have three age groups for 12-13, 14-15, 16-17.\n\nFor the boys, the same age groups that met on Sunday were the same groups that met on Wednesday nights for Boy Scouts. The same boys that were leaders on Sunday were the same in the Troop.\n\nNow that I'm in Utah and my son is a Scout, I see it 100-fold. We don't go to church any more, but nearly 100% of scout troops in Utah are chartered through the LDS church.\n\n-----\n\nSo here's the actual incident:\n\nOver the past few weeks, one of the boys had been sneaking over to one of the nursery classroom and was swiping some of their treats. Ya know, cheezy-fishy crackers. This happened a few times until he finally got caught.\n\nI got a group email from one of the leaders. They had discussed the issue on Sunday. Many of the boys knew the one boy had been doing this, but just didn't do anything about it. He has learning disabilities, attention deficit, is extremely rowdy, and on at least one occasion told an adult he was going to break into her house and kill her. He's a fuck-up, and everybody knows not to get in his way.\n\nBut, the boys were told that they had failed to stand up for what was right, and all of them were guilty for the action of one jerk.\n\nSo, after this church announcement, the Wednesday scout activity was cancelled, and all the boys were told they had to use their own money to replace the treats, and all had to come and clean the nursery room.\n\nI excused my son from this.\n\nWhat gets me is the interchangeability of the two. Cancel Scouts for a church event. Hell, even when we do a Court of Honor, it is just a bunch of scripture reading and church announcements.\n\nI don't know really where I'm going with this. I was hoping to find some other folks in the same situation and find some way to cope or maybe a good way I can approach the leadership or something.\n\nAnyway, hopefully some sort of discussion can come from this.",

In it he complains that atheism everywhere has been hijacked by the \"New Atheists\" who, he thinks, are hateful anti-religious and particularly so against Islam. He says that these \"New Atheists\" celebrities have turned atheist organizations like American Atheists into an anti-religion organization, seeking to eradicate religion everywhere, instead of simply advocate non-belief. He also denounces the keynote speaker at the forthcoming American Atheists conversion, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, as an anti-Muslim activist and venomous atheist who only seeks revenge.\n\nI have a few problems here.\n\n* First, he conflates again and again all through the article \"anti-religion\" with \"anti-religious people\" or \"anti-Islam\" with \"anti-Muslims\". The fight against ideas is very different than the fight against people. One is won with arguments, policy, laws and democracy, the other is lost with violence and war. And I don't think any atheist (or \"celebrity New Atheist\") is against religious people, but against dangerous religious ideas that permeate society and harm everyone. Everytime he interchanges \"anti-Islam\" with \"anti-Muslim\" he's being utterly dishonest and twisting the words of others.\n\n* Second, it looks like he thinks an atheist organization should only try to convince people that god doesn't exist, or talk about their lack of belief in gods and defend atheists rights, and not try to make a totally secular society. I think that's nonsense. Why can't an atheist organization try to eradicate all the social issues that stem from religion in general? Can't we discuss political topics like child indoctrination, religious schools funded with public money, women's rights? Or why can't an atheist organization even try to eradicate religion? Who can do that if not an atheist organization? Only a political party can do that? Do you think an atheist organization should limit themselves to belief/non-belief discussions and atheists rights?\n\n* Third, I think his portrayal of Ayaan Hirsi Ali as blood-thirsty revengeful atheist is really unscrupulous. He claims to know her motivations better than herself. I know some of her views can be seen as tough but, again, all she advocates is a fight against the *ideology* of Islam, against ideas, not against Muslims (I think it's CJ Werleman and others who twist her words). And he thinks a person who openly wants to eradicate religion should not have a place in an atheist convention. Is that such a bad objective?",

        "text": "\"The science of protecting people’s feelings: why we pretend all opinions are equal\"  \n\n*Washington Post*,  March 10, 2015\n\n\\- Ali Mahmoodi of the University of Tehran and a long list of colleagues from universities in the UK, Germany, China, Denmark, and the United States carried  out  studies in China, Denmark, and Iran and  recently published their findings  in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. \n\n**They assigned people to make  factual  judgements about a situation.  Some  were  better at it and some were worse.** \n\n&gt; a rational decision, you might think, would be for the less accurate group member to begin to favor the views of the more accurate one — and for the accurate one to favor his or her own assessments.\n\n&gt;But that’s not what happened. Instead, report the study authors, \n\n&gt;&gt;“the worse members of each dyad underweighted their partner’s opinion (i.e., assigned less weight to their partner’s opinion than recommended by the optimal model), whereas the better members of each dyad overweighted their partner’s opinion.” \n\n&gt;Or to put it more bluntly, individuals tended to act “as if they were as good or as bad as their partner” — even when they quite obviously weren’t.\n\n&gt;The researchers tried several variations on the experiment, and this “equality bias” didn’t go away.\n\n&gt;So why do we do this? The authors, not surprisingly, point to the incredible power of human groups, and our dependence upon being good standing members of them:\n\n&gt;By confirming themselves more often than they should have, the inferior member of each dyad may have tried to stay relevant and socially included. Conversely, the better performing member may have been trying to avoid ignoring their partner.\n\n&gt;Great instincts in general — except, of course, when facts and reality are at stake.\n\n&gt;Nobody’s saying we ought to be mean to people, or put them down when they’re wrong — or even that experts always get it right. They don’t.\n\n&gt;Still, I think it’s pretty obvious that human groups (especially in the United States) err much more in the direction of giving everybody a say than in the direction of deferring too much to experts. And that’s quite obviously harmful on any number of issues, especially in science, where what experts know really matters and lives or the world depend on it — like vaccinations or climate change.\n\n&gt;The new research underscores this conclusion — that we need to recognize experts more, respect them, and listen to them. But it also shows how our evolution in social groups binds us powerfully together and enforces collective norms, but can go haywire when it comes to recognizing and accepting inconvenient truths.\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/10/the-science-of-protecting-peoples-feelings-why-we-pretend-all-opinions-are-equal\n\n\\---------- \n\nSo  what  does this  mean  for  atheists and  skeptics? \n\n**(1)** The  study  seems  to show that most people  put a very high  value  on  not  disagreeing with others' opinions  -  if your neighbor  Hrothgar thinks that the god Thor makes lightning,  ordinary  people  would  say  *\"Hey,  what do  I know?  Maybe Mr H.  is  right about that.\"*  \n\nBut atheists and  skeptics  tend to take this  route   much  less   than  average.  Instead,  we tend  to say  *\"Ante up, dude  -  I'm not  going to give  you a free  pass  to  hold that belief* ***unless you  can  show  some  good  evidence that it's really true.\"***\n\nAccording to the  study,  this  attitude  would  be a serious  violation of  social  expectations, and  would  strike  most people  as  strange and  rude (in the  author's  words  \"being mean to people\", \"putting them down when they’re wrong\") -  and might cause many  people to  dislike those  inexplicably* strange and  rude     atheists  and  skeptics.  \n\n(* Many  people seem to  explain this  \"mysterious rudeness\" on the part of atheists and  skeptics  by  saying:  *\"They're   just  acting like that to feel cool  or think that they're  superior  to  normal  people.\"* -- I.e.  The  possibility that atheists and  skeptics  might  be  acting that  way  because they're *right*  doesn't even  seem  to  occur to many people.) \n\n**(2)** The  study  seems  to show that most people  put a very high  value  on  not  saying that some people are  right and that others  are wrong.  If  Professor Plum  says that the  Earth is 4.5  billion  years old  and Brother Joe-Bob  says that the  Earth is  6,000 years old,  for  most  people it  would be the  height  of  bad  manners to say that  Plum is  right and that Joe-Bob  is  wrong.  Instead  \"normal social behavior\" mandates that we  must  say  that both  opinions are  equally good. \n\n\\----------  \n\ntl;dr: \n\nNew  psychology study says that  people  dislike saying that one  person  is  more  correct than  another. \n\nIf this is so  then  people  may  resist  saying that  one person (e.g. a scientist)  *is*   more  correct than  another (e.g. a religious leader.)\n\nand  people  who  *do*   go  around  saying that  others are  wrong  (e.g.  atheists and skeptics)  may  be  considered strange and  obnoxious.

God is the most important thing to my grandfather and I don't want to hurt him by being his only grandchild that outright rejects his beliefs. That being said, I have a lot of respect for religion: I understand its benefits and appreciate those who do not use it to justify cruelty and judgement. I always knew that if my family knew my beliefs, they would think less of me. But I love them anyway and I don't want to lose them. But after tonight, I have lost a lot of respect for someone who has been a hero to me my whole life. I am deeply heartbroken that he would scream at me because of my compassion for animals. I volunteer with rescued exotic birds every week and will be studying veterinary medicine this fall. He has been making snarky comments to me for weeks about it, suggesting I value them over humans even though I have done plenty of charity work for St. Jude's and the Alzheimers Association. \n\nI'm very frustrated and a bit heartbroken after tonight. I wanted to start a discussion of dealing with fanatical family members. Coming out is simply not an option for me, but how have you guys dealt with having different views than your family? \n\nThank you for reading my rant, if you did. I was heartbroken after this. I needed to get it off my chest somewhere and it helped very much. ",

        "text": "This I call \"The Argument Against Evangelism.\" It's sort of like a softer/inverse form of the Problem of Evil.\n\n--------------------\n\nEvangelists generally agree that: \n\n**P1a: It is best for your well-being to believe in God.**\n\n**P2a: Some people do not believe in God.**\n\n**Ca: Therefore, we should convince people to believe in God.**\n\nEvangelists also generally agree that God is the three omnis. \n\n----------------\n\n**P1: If God is all-knowing, then he knows what will convince me.**\n\n**P2: If God is all-powerful, then he has the power to convince me.**\n\n**P3: If God is all-good, then he would be compelled to convince me (because, being all-good, God would necessarily be compelled to do what is in my best interest).**\n\n**P4: I am not convinced.**\n\n**C:  Therefore, either God does not exist (must sacrifice one of the three omnis), or P1a is wrong (believing in God is not best for my well-being).**\n\nThis argument creates a dilemma because you have to give up either one of God's three omnis (in which case he is not God) or give up the idea that believing in God is best for our well-being. Either way, it does away evangelism, making it incoherent like a married bachelor. Even if someone wants to throw the \"free will\" argument at this, it still **does not** deal with the fact that P3 necessarily follows from Gods characteristics, if in fact P1a. It still follows that God would be compelled to convince me, and (having the knowledge and power to do so) would have no excuse not to -- and against an entity such as God, I would have no chance at resisting such a belief. \n\nWhat this argument shows is that God, according to his attributes, must necessarily be trying to convince me with all of his power and knowledge. I remain unconvinced, which is necessarily impossible. \n\nA simplified version is this modus tollens form of the argument:\n\n**P1: If it is necessary for my well-being to believe in God, then I would necessarily believe in God.**\n\n**P2: I do not believe in God.**\n\n**C: Therefore, belief in God is not necessary for my well-being.**\n\n---------------\n\nAnd if an evangelist claims, \"Well that's why I'm here. God sent me to deliver his message.\" If that's the case, then (as a matter of necessity), that evangelist cannot fail. The concept of the evangelist failing to convert someone is an incoherent concept. A simple way of putting it: **A bad evangelist is as incoherent of a concept as a married bachelor.** If it's the case that evangelists are God's mode of convincing people, then they would be not unlike a beacon of irrefutable knowledge that inescapably compels people to believe their message.

Does it not seem reasonable then to assert that a person's feeling of the divine is therefore grounds for believing that the divine exists? In essence, it's \"You feel love, and so believe love is real; I feel God, and so believe God is real.\" \n\nI've perhaps detected a flaw in the argument here, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it before I spill the beans. I don't want to subconsciously shape any responses to this argument into running along only 1 response; ideally, I'd like to see if there are multiple things wrong with this line of argumentation, if at all.\n\nSo then, do you find this argument reasonable? If not, what flaws can you find in it?\n\nCheers for those of you who take the time to answer my question :) This sub does a pretty good job about keeping things a little more dispassionate than our parent sub.",

        "text": "**tl;dr at bottom.**\n\nFrom the age of 9, I was raised as a Christian, living in the bible belt of the US. I was very devout and active in the church until about 8 years ago. Christianity was the truth of life and all I had been taught. The change occurred, as with many, when I finally left home and began to meet people outside the circle of churchgoers and like minded family friends. I was lucky enough to have amazing atheist co-workers, who wouldn't criticize my views or talk down to me. They didn't pressure me or my beliefs. They actually didn't say anything at all to me about it unless I brought it up in conversation. Their silence on the subject is what actually intrigued me the most about it. It was this that finally challenged me to deny the God I had been brought up to believe and place all my hope and trust in.\n\nSurprisingly, that wasn't really difficult. As logic started pouring in, I gradually became more comfortable with the idea of living godless and being okay with it, to the point where I felt like it was normal. After realizing that atheism is the most logical worldview for me, I began to feel disdain toward Christians, and other theists for that matter. I started reading a lot of Hitchens, Dawkins, Harris, and Dennett. The more I read, the more haughty I felt.\n\nI began to believe that I, as an atheist, was much more intelligent than my theist friends. I would look down on them and criticize them. I never did this to them orally or in print, but I did it in my mind. I got to the point where I would \"unfriend\" them on social media when they would post an inspirational bible verse or theist leaning message. I was very passive with my disapproval and slowly distanced myself from them.\n\nSince my family remained theists, all of my family friends and all the people I had known since childhood were all ignorant fools in my mind. I never really \"came out\" to non-family members in an official capacity, but people began to notice when we were gathered at events. I would defend liberalism and humanism, and denounce Christian-centered ideas. Obviously, I had stopped attending church services altogether and made it a point to tell my family that I was now Atheist and I didn't believe in God's existence.\n\nToday, I was sitting at my desk, reading some random, unrelated articles online. For some reason, I starting thinking about a friend of mine that I hadn't spoken with in many years. He was married now, he has 2 small children. Sadly, I don't know anything more about him than that. We used to be the best of friends. We spent countless hours with each other and shared everything. Now, we've grown apart to such an extent that I barely even think about him. I was instantly saddened. I know that I had made a conscious effort to distance myself from him and many others, because, \"they don't know what I know, their world view is false, and I am better off without them in my life.\" Why did I do this? How did I let myself get to this place?\n\nI believe the mistake I made was placing blame on people, rather than institutions. I had developed distrust and resentment toward Christianity for the many years of my life I felt I wasted sitting in pews and listening to old men tell me why I was a sinner and deserved hell without Jesus. A majority of my life was spent believing in a false deity in worship and praise, these beliefs reinforced by all those around me. I was privately blaming all of the people in my life for these things. Then, I realized that I too had reinforced those beliefs for others. I had encouraged people to devote their lives to this deity and challenged them to place their hope and trust in Jesus. I was just as guilty as those I despised.\n\nI am now on my own personal road to redemption, to win back the relationships I disowned and restore the human bond I used to have with so many people. I may not share the same world view as others, but we're all humans trying to figure out how best to pass the time we have. We may not have a truly intrinsic purpose in the universe, but that shouldn't be the driving force behind how and why we live. We have the human experience and I have decided to spend the rest of my time trying to figure out what that means for me.\n\n**tl;dr** - After denouncing theism, I abandoned relationships with those who didn't share my world view. My actions are no better than those who do the same thing from the opposite end of the spectrum. I will focus my time on restoring relationships and loving everyone, regardless of their position on theism.\n\n**Supplement:** I admire the work of Hitchens, et al., but I apply their insight from a humanist perspective as apposed to an anti-theist one. I believe there is a place and time, namely formal debates, where anti-theism deserves credence. Humans can be very fragile intellectually and tend to become emotionally charged when their long-held, personal beliefs are challenged. This is my opinion and I don't believe there is a \"best\" way of discussing personal world views. That doesn't keep me from feeling like certain beliefs are completely ignorant and at times, very harmful, but I have chosen to initially take a gentle approach when discussing these ideas with theists.",

        "text": "First, please excuse any misspellings or format errors.  I'm on some pain drugs.  I've been having heart troubles for a couple of years and I finally got a surgery to correct an enlarged heart septum.  The doctors removed the temp pacemaker and I was supposed to get out today.  But while I was asleep this morning, my heart stopped several times.  I went into seizures and was very confused.  I came out of one seizure long enough to see a cardio team resuscitating me and they were asking all the questions to figure out if I was lucid.  They told me what had happened and they were trying to get my heart started and stabilized.  My heart stopped again and I went into another seizure.  They started it again with external pacing.\n\nHere is the rub.  I was pretty certain I was going to die and in my fear, I thought 'OK just in case, I'll accept Jesus'.  As I came out of it, I was still confused but thought 'okay, I was just afraid and fell into the long-held superstition from when I was christian.'  I still don't believe in god or anything, but the fear of the finality and getting my foot in the door was very upsetting.  If they hadn't resuscitated me or stopped the first seizure, I think I would have just died while having strange dreams since the dream state was still active as I was coming to.\n\nI was rushed to the ER and a permanent pacemaker was put in, so I think I'm on the mend.  But that one last ditch effort makes me feel very uncomfortable.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience like this or any insight?\n\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the good words and well wishes folks.  About an hour after posting this, my heart stopped again while having my family in the hospital room.  The doctors did external pacing again and ran me to the ER.  My heart stopped at least 8 times last night, but the final time, I was able to keep conscious as the paddles were zapping me.  The doctor took out the stitches from the pacemaker and re-seated the leads deeper into the heart.  Feeling a bit better today and I should get home tomorrow.\n\nEDIT 2:  The hospital chaplain just came in to talk.  She asked me what I thought of it all, told me to expect some PTSD in me and my family, and didn't ask me to convert.  I had told her I was an atheist, so she kept it to just the psychological and family effects this might have.  All in all, she was very supportive.  She was also there last night to help pass info between the surgical team and my family.",

Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel states “They [MHGs] are tools of control used by purveyors of religion to cement their grip on power,”. The study shows that a belief in \"Supernatural Punishment\" like the karma system or ancestral spirits tend to be the first common moral supervisor and usually helped possibly even started complex political systems. I figure most here knew this already or could deduce it by our own knowledge of the human brain and it's tendency to seek power.

It then moved into favor and eventually began persecuting other belief systems in an attempt to dismantle them and recruit members. I think that Islam may be going through a similar evolution and a massive number of extremists are using violence to over-take other belief systems. And it's more far-reaching because of the technology we have now. Christianity doesn't use this same levels of violence and coercion in modern times because it mostly exists in more secular societies and there are laws and social expectations to keep it in check. There are, however, many MANY Christian fundamentalist sects who I wouldn't put it past to resort to violence given the chance. \n\nThis, of course, upsets my SO. I believe it could be because he thinks that this means I think ALL Christians could become violent, given the chance. That's not at all the truth; just as not all Muslims are violent extremists, most Christians are not fundamentalists.\n\nI realize I'm over-simplifying the history of Christianity and Islam, but I'm not an expert and am trying to be succinct.\n \nI'm interested to hear other's opinions.

Just because it is seems impossible doesn't mean it is intelligent design. He skirted around that and accepted my  argument but what he hung his hat on is the idea that there MUST be a WHY to the Universe. I explained that science does not provide the answer to why but rather the what, where, when, and how. His proof for intelligent design is that there must be a reason for the universe to exist and that since science cannot give us one God must exist. What are your guys's thoughts on this?",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nSo I was going to come and ask if anyone knew of non-theistic, non-philosophical ethical writings; specifically things that suggested what one 'ought' to do - without the metaphysical and verbose nature that accompanies much of the philosophy I've read.\n\nThe closest thing I knew was humanism, so I decided to do a quick search which led me to find the [ethical cultural movement and religious humanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_movement) - and basically was what I was looking for.\n\nIn general, it seems like it would be a pretty good idea to have a form of 'religious' atheism - in that it would \n\na) Allow for group cohesion and community - indeed, a considerable benefit to religion over atheism is the community associated with it.  Although I think, ideally, any ingroup-outgroup bias should not exist, it's such an ingrained biological motivation and one that religion, at least currently, seems to fill.\n\nb) Allow for a structured-group moral community - Other than things like the ACLU, moral violations stemming from a religious point are hard to combat, unless they tramp on some other group community (abortion-women &amp; same-sex marriage-LGBT community).  Atheists, on average, are more likely to seek out evidence-based policy, since there is no god asserting a deontological right and wrong and are more likely to acknowledge that our world has significantly changed since the religions were formed and require an updated code of moral values. \n\nc) Allow for combined efforts towards philanthropy.  While we can all give money, there are also causes that benefit from combined efforts in terms of time/energy.\n\nReading up a bit more as I'm typing this, I found that my core ideas are similar to the core ideas listed:\n\nThe belief that morality is independent of theology;\n\nThe affirmation that new moral problems have arisen in modern industrial society which \nhave not been adequately dealt with by the world's religions;\n\nThe duty to engage in philanthropy in the advancement of morality;\n\nThe belief that self-reform should go in lock step with social reform;\n\nThe establishment of republican rather than monarchical governance of Ethical societies\n\nThe agreement that educating the young is the most important aim.\n\nAnyway,\n\nThose are just some preliminary thoughts.  I'd be interested in hearing what others have to say.  Supplying reading that both confirms or contradicts these ideas is encouraged!!\n\nThanks!\n\n",

        "text": "So there I was, 17 years old, riding in the car with my dad going to pick up our vehicle up from an oil change in another town (it was free under warranty). I told my dad about the Ken Ham debate with Bill Nye and we were discussing the extremists of separate religions. Things lead on for a bit and then with such an exchange, you can expect what question came up.\n\n\"Are you an atheist?\" The interesting part is that my father is a non-practicing Catholic, my mother is a non-practicing whatever she is. I kept quiet for a few seconds and replied.\n\n\"Yes.\" He semi-jokingly tells me to get out of the car. I refuse and tell him to keep driving. We discuss things a bit more and I'm able to hold my own against my father. We go to pick up the car and part ways. I get home several hours later because I didn't want to face him or my mother. I was just wandering Walmart and having some 'alone' time. I get back and the arguing begins. My father had told my mother. She is mad. No, she's pissed. She screams at me and says things like \"I'm so disappointed in you!\" and \"I thought you were smarter than this!\"\n\nIt goes on, but I'm able to hold my ground. Things are quiet for the most part for the next few weeks. Then the passive-agressiveness begins. My dad shows me simple christian jokes about atheists, my mom comments on my behavior, and the list goes on.\n\nI need to disclose that my relationship with my mother in the past few years has become a bit hostile. I'm no longer afraid of her and I refuse to be bullied. This became a power struggle between us and I refuse to back down. I don't know if it's me growing up or what. So, one day, everything just breaks down. Yelling matches happen. We go back and forth. I finally storm outside. I go to a quiet place to sit and think. I've got tears rolling down my face because of the emotions flooding me.\n\nTwenty minutes pass and my dad goes outside to talk. I tell him that if this is how things are going to be while I'm here, they will no longer have a relationship with me once I am gone. My dad is sympathetic and talks to me for a bit and we discuss my mother and her actions and my responses. It was very calm and kind. He was showing his inner father. I finally go back in and apologize for how I acted. My mother, in her all-knowing mannerisms, accepts without one of her own.\n\nI really began to view my dad as my father. My dad has always been busy never been much of a talker. He was essentially a social retard. But we become close. I really love my dad even though he gave me shit for a few weeks. He has yet to make a comment on my choices since the talk. I have no problem talking to him about my problems anymore. My dad has become my mentor while I'm going through college. My mom started out as a bitch when I left. I come back for my first break and we have an argument again. It was over something stupid. But I never got a hug or a goodbye from her when I left after my first time back from college.\n\nI don't know why but even with my dad being the 'Catholic', he's the more understanding. I believe it stems from the amount of education he's gone through. He went through college, became a doctor, and has been studying ever since. My mom went to college for a year and then dropped out. I don't know if that's the major difference but I feel like it may be. I began my life as a child and thought as a child does. But as I grew, I became an educated man and am recognized by my father as one. I wish he had been this way earlier in my life, but I'm glad it finally came when I really needed him.\n\nI have a message for my parents:\n\nI love you dad. I feel like I love you mom. It's hard to tell anymore. Feelings are hard and I don't know how to feel about us anymore. You need to stop trying to control me like you do with my brother and did with my sister. I'm not going to be you. I'm going to love any child I am lucky enough to care for and will no matter their life decisions.",

(Like, you convince people they're being healed and voila! they're actually improving, not just subjectively.) Am I right? If yes, then how does this work? How curing by any sort of conviction (even if a little bit) is reconcilable with materialism? Same question for hypnosis - how do you make a person's body stiff like a plank, or make orgasm, etc, by just talking, assuming materialism?\n\nOr maybe I'm just confusing something? (For the record, I'm 100% humanist, and thus anti-religious - on moral grounds - and will/would remain one even if proved god, but I'm probably not very strong at metaphysics and philosophy stuff.)",

        "text": "Arguing with friend about afterlife / ghosts, I gave roughly this argument against the possibility of afterlife / any mystical realm / ghosts:\n\n-----\nSuppose: \n1. Anything that happens or exists in the physical universe (our universe as we know it) leaves physical evidence / can be physically detected (seems almost obvious)\n\n/:. If a soul somehow connects with / interacts with a (physical) body, then it *must* be physically detectable / there is some physical evidence of this\n-----\n\nBut my friend insisted that it *does* interact with a physical body, but does *not* leave any physical evidence / is not physically evident.\n\nI said that this is logically impossible, as my supposition states.\n\nMy argument completely reminds me of something I read but I can't remember it / seem to find it. The argument basically states that it's logically impossible for there to be something which is \"mystical\" or \"of another realm\" yet interacts with the physical universe without a trace / clue / evidence. A sort of argument against the idea of a mystical realm that is undetectable / unknowable yet interacts with the physical world. Does this remind you of any work / author? \n\nFurther, what do you personally think of the argument? Do you find it convincing? I don't see it very often in debates... maybe it's fallen out of favor / not as convincing anymore?\n\n**EDIT:** cool responses, thank you. If you can link to a video / author / work that you think does a great job articulating this argument, I would *really* appreciate that for my own enjoyment, and to send my friend :)\n",
