Im relatively new to this, as before I used to teach school students, being at university is different, and sometimes I find the lines in my professional relationship with my students might get blurred, also because they see me as young and believe that they can communicate with me as a peer sometimes. I've befriended some of my ex students who are in all honesty great and I'm fine with that. However, this semester I teach a girl who just won't give up. I always ignore her advances or act as if I don't know what's up, she keeps sending me note (leaves them at my car) and waits for me at the end of the lecture. She's asked me for my phone number, which I refused to give her, instead I gave her my personal email, and yet shes still adamant. Today she left a very emotional note on my car, telling me how much she loves me, and that she loves my eyes and my smile, obviously things that wouldn't be considered as a \"hey, I wanna be your friend.\" So at this point I just really don't know what to do, I'm not great at confrontation and I also don't want to embarrass her in any way. Does anyone have any ideas how I can in a friendly way redefine my relationship with her so it's goes back to being professional student teacher, without any hard feelings and without hurting her? Might I add to that that I myself am a female in a Muslim country, so yeah. but kinda shocked cause she's my student. Help?",

Basically, in the original conference paper, I had put a footnote at the end of a particular paragraph. However, for some reason, I later on divided this paragraph into two (Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2) . Now the situation is as follows:\n\nThe last sentence of the first paragraph ends with a direct quote from a historical primary source. The footnote for this source however now comes after the first sentence of the second paragraph:\n\n\"Quote from primary source 1\" \\[End of Paragraph 1\\]\n\n\\[Start of Paragraph 2\\] Additional content from primary source 1.^(footnote)\n\nI think that this might be confusing for readers. If one looks up the footnote at the beginning of paragraph 2, one will however clearly find where the quote comes from. Now, the easiest thing to do would be to put both paragraphs together again. In this case, the footnote would clearly point to both the quote and the further content from the primary source.\n\nNow, I do not think that this is a huge mistake. Anyone really wanting to find the source for said quote should be able to find it, as I would think the natural thing to do would be to go to the next possible footnote in paragraph 2.\n\nHowever, I am still wondering if such an inclarity would warrant writing to the journal? Given that I would need to merge both paragraphs, I would imagine that it might make quite a change to the design of the article. I am simply not sure whether such a small mistake (if one even would call it that) warrants all the fuss with writing to the editor etc. At the same time, if I do nothing, might committees I sent the article to as a writing sample notice this and view it as negative or a sign of sloppiness?\n\nThanks for your help.",

I had several big ideas for my masters degree when I was starting, some of which were feasible some were not. My supervisor agreed to let me do a masters on my own project rather than a project assigned by him. Shortly after I started my masters my supervisor got tenure and has progressively disappeared from involvement in the lab (he has many outside involvements and directorships). I also realized he knows little about the field as he switched subfields entirely about halfway through his tenure eligibility. In my first year he provided managerial support but not so much research support and my projects just spun in circles. I felt depressed and didn't get any work done without the threat of a meeting with him, I suppose a leftover from highly structured undergrad. Work evolved slowly in my second year, I developed feasible planned projects and collected data but he provided less and less support. Now I have finished the \"data collection\" part of a few projects, although some are multi-stage, but he has dropped off the map entirely, not even responding to emails much of the time. I'm much much better about being self motivated, but feel quite daunted about the prospect of finishing off my projects alone and the possibility of being left with no publications to show for my masters degree. This is a thesis-based masters, we took only 6 classes. I can turn whatever paper(s) I publish into my thesis so papers are my first focus. My field has a fairly high publication rate. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1. How bad does it look to have published in ones' undergrad but not at all in ones' masters degree considering that my masters degree seems to be quite similar to the first 2 years of an American PhD? I have plenty of partial projects and ideas...\n2. How does taking an extra 4 months look to an admissions committee? an extra 8? \n3. What can I do in my remaining 6-10 months to put myself in a more favourable position, aside from \"finish a project\"? I'm trying to find some additional references; I have 5-6 \"maybe\" professors aside from my supervisor). \n4. How should I best spin this story in a future PhD application?\n\nAny answer you can give me would be appreciated!",

        "text": "I need some major advice. To provide quick background information, I am an undergraduate Engineering student who is already beyond the 18 credit repeat policy at my institution. So failing and repeating another class is not an option for the reason that I will probably be kicked out of the engineering school and maybe even the institution.\n\nI just finished the required Professional Writing class during the Summer semester. I have been emailing my professor because I fell far behind class schedule and actually gave her the reason that I was sick with stomach problems for over a week, which wasn't completely truthful. I even falsified my work timesheet to show \"proof\" that I was sick and could not work because I never go to the doctor for common colds and stomachaches hence no doctor's note for proof... I haven't yet received a response, but I want to tell her the complete truth and fix the F on my transcript because failing is not an option.\n\nI have recently (for around 6 months) been diagnosed with ADHD. During this past Spring semester, I did fairly well (receiving two B's and one B-), which I primarily attribute to quitting video games (and other distractions) and completely focusing on schoolwork. To be completely truthful, the main reason I fell so far behind class schedule is that I got distracted by video games again. I understand that this reason is outrageous and motivated me to regrettably lie in the beginning. I was indeed sick with stomach problems for 3-4 days, but I altered the truth by saying over a week. Unfortunately, when I was sick, I felt so bored at home that I regrettably decided to start playing video games again. Due to this distraction, I did not turn in my final paper (30&amp;#37; of my grade) due last Friday until yesterday, four days past the deadline and after the course already finished.\n\nI am truly sorry for betraying my professor's trust and I want to regain her trust and fix my grade by telling her the truth. Also, later today, I have an appointment with my psychiatrist for monthly check ups on the ADHD, when I plan to tell my doctor the truth and seek advice/help from him. It is safe to say that I have now quit video games and hopefully won't return because I realize it keeps ruining my academic life. Can anyone offer advice?",

        "text": "I'm a late stage PhD candidate with a bit of a conundrum... I'd spent about 1.5 years developing and implementing an important model run for a paper with some collaborators. My part was done relatively quickly compared to the rest of the paper, but it alone ended up being a crucial part of the paper's results - it is called out directly in the abstract, results, conclusion, and even the title of the paper. It's not like we wrote out a contract or anything but it was generally understood that I'd be part of this paper. So I do my part and the project goes on for a few years and I check in occasionally while the main author does her thing.\n\nImagine my surprise when, last week, I find the paper published in PNAS without even so much as a mention of my name in either the author list or the acknowledgments! Nevermind that my contribution was one of the headline results or that it took up over a year of my time (and funding, grumble). The paper was led by our collaborators but a professor in my department, who is on my committee, was heavily involved in the paper and was the main connection between us and our collaborators. It's shocking and disappointing that she would somehow neglect to include me in the discussions. To add to the political aspect, somebody else is on the paper who I'm certain did little work - he was an author on our last paper on the same topic but did not do any of the computational modeling work that is being showcased in this new paper... I know for a fact he doesn't know how. I have no idea how that could be but it looks like he was just thrown on the authorship list for some reason. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm quite frustrated. But now I'm not sure what to do. Way after the fact, she wrote me an uncharacteristically friendly email showing the paper was published and privately acknowledging my contribution (but not apologizing...), maybe meant to just make me feel better? She downplayed how much I would have benefited from the authorship but that, frankly, seems insane to me. I don't feel like I have power in this situation but I feel I was severely exploited. Is there a way to post-hoc edit the authorship list somehow...? How do I prevent this from happening again? Any similar stories from others here?",

I think the combined skill set is worthwhile but others have incited doubt in me.\n\nI recently graduated with a MA in a social science program from a Canadian institution. I always thought I'd go to law school and become a criminal defence attorney. I thoroughly enjoyed doing my MA thesis, and I have many follow-up research questions based on my study's results that I'm eager and curious to investigate. One of my co-advisors said my thesis was one of the best that they've read over their career and they are strongly encouraging me to do a PhD.\n\nNow I feel torn between a career in research and one in law. But at the end of the day, I think what I really want is a career the encompasses both, perhaps policy work. The results from my thesis have strong implications for policy and I suspect this would be the case for future research based on my areas of interest.",

The announcement encouraged applicants from underrepresented backgrounds to apply, and I mentioned my disability in my letter of intent.  I've been told that I don't have to write about it in my application package, but it was suggested that giving the reviewers some insight and education about me as an applicant might be a good idea.  \n\nSome relevant details: I have pretty mild cerebral palsy which causes me some ambulation issues, pain/stiffness, fatigue, and a sensitivity to time pressure (e.g. my 'processing speed' is slow and if I'd had that aspect of my condition diagnosed earlier, I would have gotten extra time to take exams when I was a student).  \n\nMy feelings about all this are (a) that I take a little longer than my peers/colleagues to get my sh*t done, but it always gets done, and (b) despite chronic pain and fatigue, I  have managed to be pretty productive.  I have an arrangement where I can work from home one day a week so I have a day where I can schedule healthcare appointments; however, I can't shake feelings of guilt and a bit of shame about taking this time away from the lab. My record is good enough that I was invited to apply for this grant.  \n\nI've written a short paragraph about this in my candidate statement and showed it to some folks, but have been told that \"it reads like [my] imposter syndrome wrote it.\"  Does anyone have any advice on the tone to take in writing about a disability?

The \"write a research paper, get it published, and make a large strategic donation to the university your adviser works at\" route has been suggested by a friend with a lot of money, but the problem with that approach is you have to start by being rich. I also don't know that gets you much cred as an academic taking that approach, but having enough money to get a building named after you probably opens other doors I don't know about.\n\nAny other paths to pursuing a doctorate that doesn't involve moving away from home and family and incurring mountains of debt?

We were just informed today that while our proposal had very good reviews and ratings, it was not selected for funding. Fine, this happens all the time, but in the rationale for not funding, one of the points given stated:\n\n\"3. The panel expressed concern that the leading PI of the proposed project is not in a more permanent position with their institution. Given that this is a 5-year project with a significant budget, the panel felt that there would be significant risk in awarding such a large, long-duration proposal to be led by an investigator who may have to leave their institution before it is completed.\"\n\nThat sounds absolutely ridiculous to me, because it basically says only tenured faculty can be awarded large grants. I have no intention of leaving my institution, I still have relatively stable funding for the next 3 years with my current projects (which the grant panel knows, because we have to submit current and past funding disclosure), so it's not like I'm in danger of just suddenly dropping out. I've also had a strong record of bringing in funding which is also disclosed in the current/past funding disclosure.\n\nPlus, faculty of all stripes change institutions or leave in the middle of projects for all kinds of different reasons: tenured faculty can go to a different institution, tenure-track faculty can not make tenure, etc. I don't see what the fact that I'm not TT or tenured has to do with whether I can lead this grant or not, especially when my funding record is strong and my current funding is stable.\n\nFinally, in addition to me, the project has 6 co-PIs, 3 of which are at my institution and could take over if I left for some reason.\n\nI've applied for many grants over the years, had a lot rejected and had a lot awarded, and this is the first time I've ever experienced this (explicitly anyway).

I have a friend who is an excellent proofreader, but she has never done it professionally.  She has offered to proof my work, but I'd like an idea of what to pay her. \n\nI have checked online and with proofing services and I'm asking here for even  more info.\n\nI know many proof their own papers... but I always miss errors doing this. I'd rather pay for a second pair of eyes.\n\nI also posted this on r/professors.\n\nThanks for any insight!",

My dilema is this: my wife is finishing her last two years of medical school in a town in which it seems my only option is to reamin in the same lab that I did my PhD in for 2 years, or work in small-time industry as a low-level researcher.  Or, we can spilt up our little family (we have a toddler) and I can get a more substantial post-doc far away from where I am now. I am trying to decide if it is worth it to leave my family for a couple of years, and alternatively, how much staying in the same lab for that time affect my academic career. Any advice would be appreciated.",
