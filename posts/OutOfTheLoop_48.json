I've made many posts about this, but many people said I was wrong by saying Pit Bulls aren't killer machines, and I don't know who's wrong here.\n\nI know Pitts usually are more agressive than the other breeds, but isn't ending the entire breed too much? Maybe making them less agressive won't be better? I think these things aren't the dog's fault but the owner's fault, but maybe that's because I once had a Pitt so I empathize with them.\n\nAnyways, what's happening on reddit? Everyone suddenly said \"well, let's just end an entire dog breed\"? **I agree with the people who wants them less agressive**, like, just the less agressives can have babies, but I think ending with a entire breed is too much.\n\nAm I wrong or these people who want's to \"extinguish them all\" are the wrong ones? That's all I need to know",

But he seems to have a much larger following on social media than there are kickboxer fans that exist.  It's a pretty niche sport and I don't know of anyone who watches it (which is saying something because the only exercise I do is BJJ training so I would have thought that of all my BJJ friends/coach/sparring partners at least one would like kickboxing)\n\n I also have bad English (still learning, sorry) so please try to explain using words that  someone whose second language is English would understand if that is allowed.  I hope that's okay, sorry if its not a reasonable request\n\n**Thank you to anyone who explains the answer to me, I appreciate it.  Sorry for any english mistakes I made in this post**",
