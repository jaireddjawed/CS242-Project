So I apologize if this comes across as a silly question.\nThis is something that has been rolling around in my brain for some time and I found this sub and seems like a good opportunity to ask.\n\nIf scientists can't see black holes because there's no visible light coming from them, then why can't they just look for the absence of light? Surely it must be darker than the surrounding area? \nUnless there's far more to black holes than just being absent of light that isn't touched on in shows about space?\n\nthank you in advance for anyone who can explain this to me.",

        "text": " Assuming a fairly typical star formation process, is it reasonable to assume similar distributions of minerals in the accretion disk in any given proto-star’s system?  I assume that stars will only form under roughly similar conditions, although the type of star which forms must be dictated, to some degree or another, by the materials in the dust cloud which birthed it (and, presumably, the actual mass and distribution of said cloud).  If a nebula/dust cloud is capable of birthing a star, what can we assume about the composition of the surrounding material?  How much does this vary?\n\nCome to think of it, just how typical are star systems in the first place?  It seems reasonable to assume that, if a star can form, there is enough material surrounding it that some sort of ‘system’ will form as a result of the star’s formation and subsequent heat and gravitational effects on the materials invariably left over (and potentially ejecta from the star during the formation and ignition process?). \n\nFor the purpose of developing a hard-science Science Fiction computer game, I am trying to devise (or discover) a fairly simple system to determine what mineral and gaseous elements are likely to be found in a given star system, given the star’s particular attributes (age, mass, stellar classification, etc).  Is there any correlation to be found between, say, the formation of a low-mass star (or even a brown dwarf), and the amount of heavy metals that is likely to exist within the accretion disk, before any major planetary accumulation has occurred?\n\nAlso, how much, if any, does planetary formation (coagulation?) affect the minerals that happen to form the planetary body (i.e. are any minerals actually formed during planetary formation due to the heat and pressure of the formation process?)\n\nBasically, how would we know what kind of minerals to expect in terrestrial planets, planetoids, and asteroids in another star system, at varying points along the life-cycle of that particular system?",

Due to time dilation the Earth's core is 2.5 years younger than it's surface. Congruently the sun's core is 16,000 years younger than it's surface. \n\nI believe I can follow the concept this far.  I'm curious how this would effect the comparative aging of the two celestial bodies. How much faster is the surface of the earth aging compared to the core of the sun?\n\nFor an image. Let's say the day the earth formed, some 4.5 billion years ago, you had 2 stop watches. One on the surface of the Earth and one at the core of the Sun. Now you flash forward to today and the stop watch on Earth's surface says 4.5 billion years. What would the stop watch at the center of the Sun say?",

And if that is the case why does like matter not count as an outside observer? I believe the word observer is where the problem stems from, otherwise this hints at a cosmic consciousness, to be able to collapse the wave function..

You find a neat little planet orbiting the AC system (I think we've found one there) and decide to check out it's surface, see if there's any cool scenery because your telescope is just that awesome.\n\nTo your utter surprise, as you scan the surface of this mysterious planet, you come across a similar looking telescope! You can see the entire thing and are kind of bewildered but you keep looking at it in amazement. You look at it for a while and then, holy shit, someone steps out of it! It doesn't really matter what they look like, but to make the story cooler we'll say Warf from star trek is the \"person\" you observe.\n\nNow, let's say that Warf and you just so happened to stumble upon eachother's telescopes at roughly the same \"time\" and as Warf steps out of his telescope, he holds up a REALLY big sign that says, \"I see you! Can you see me?\"\n\nThe light that Warf is observing which includes your telescope and you has been traveling for 4 years. Also, the light that you are observing which includes Warf and his bad ass telescope have also been traveling for 4 years.\n\n(this is where I get a little fuzzy)\n\nInitially I thought that from Warf's frame: he holds the sign up, has to wait 4 years + another 4 years to receive a signal from you and vice-versa. However, upon thinking too much about it, I began to think that this \"sign\" communication could be a way to \"break\" the \"time lag\". i.e. A way to communicate \"through\" time instead of waiting. From Warf's reference frame, he would be communicating to the \"past\", and to him, you communicating to the \"future\" instantaneously as if the two of you were sitting at Starbucks.\n\nAnd here is my question:\n\nIf you and Warf can actually look at one another through the 4 ly distance, couldn't instantaneous communication take place at least in ONE direction?\n\nI want to know what you all think about this or if it's just gibberish.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "My question is this: is it possible/likely that the big bang was the result of continual combination super massive black holes?\n\nNow for a little explanation of my thought process:\n\nFirst of all, we know that there are super-massive black holes at the center of every known galaxy. From time to time, matter in the galaxy will make its way towards the center, and the black hole will start to “feed,” absorbing massive amounts of gas, stars, space debris, etc.\n\nSo my theory works like this: As these super-massive black holes feed from time to time over the course of billions/trillions of years, they will consume the entire galaxy that orbits them (seems like the only possible outcome, right? I mean eventually all orbits degrade). And then the black hole will be massive enough to start attracting other galaxies and black holes from further away and will grow into ultra-massive galaxies. Then these ultra-massive black holes will begin to combine (cause it’s just gravity right? Like the more massive the object the further the “reach” of its gravitational field)…..and as the black holes keep feeding on each other they eventually reach a critical mass. When 2 black holes of critical mass collide….big bang.\n\nI think this satisfies a couple issues with the big bang theory:\n\n1. We don’t have an explanation as to how virtually infinite mass was concentrated in a virtually volumeless area: if ultra-massive black holes combined with each other, their density would increase with each combination, compressing the matter more and more.\n\n2. We don’t have mechanism to cause the bang: the combination of 2 black holes of critical mass, I think, could cause a massive explosion. Just like 2 pool balls smacking into each other at 100 miles an hour? This huge energy release could possibly be enough to allow matter to escape the enormous gravitational field.\n\nProblems with my theory:\n\n1. No accounting for the interconnected nature of space and time. Unless a sufficiently massive black hole could exert an attracting force on what we call “time.” I guess it’s possible. We know that a black hole can warp the fabric of space-time. Maybe a black hole with the density of an entire universe could even absorb that fabric?\n\nLast point: everything in nature seems to operate off of some sort of cycle. This would fit that paradigm as our universe would be in continual flux between expanding and contracting; creation and destruction.\n\nAnyway, this was a fun thought experiment for me, please let me know your thoughts!",

Yes, you do kill your grandfather. However, in your specific timeline a future version of you did not kill your grandfather, meaning that you are alive. The timeline you travel into to kill your grandfather is another timeline to the one you were born into. Therefore when you kill your grandfather and travel back to the present, your self (IN THAT TIMELINE) will not exist. However, you, from another timeline, will exist - in that timeline. This is most likely worded in a bad way - but i hope some of you understand what i am trying to say.",

I come with maybe a slightly off-topic question. \n\nI am currently a rising senior in a high school in Pennsylvania and have been dreaming of an astrophysics career for a really long time now. I have done a good amount of self-study and research about topics in astronomy (Wikipedia binging and arxiv.org as well as some astrobites.org), participated in competitions (science olympiad and the USAAAO), and have read through a good amount of Carroll and Ostlie. But, it is finally time for me to begin applying to colleges and plan for my future. \n\nMy question is this: what are some of the things I should be looking for in a college? What are some of the well-known undergraduate physics/astronomy programs that also offer research experience? My goal is to eventually obtain a PhD, so what would be the logical steps to take to get there?\n\nCurrently, I’m looking into these colleges: Princeton, UPenn, University of Maryland, University of Michigan, University of Pittsburgh.\n\nIdeally, I would go to Caltech, but I need to consider financial aid, and the from the ones I have listed, my number 1 choice would be Princeton for its aid. \n\nI really don’t know who to ask about this kind of stuff so I decided to turn to you guys. Thank you ahead of time!\n\nEdit: a word",

If time is a field of different intensities, it will by nature only have one direction. thus this dissolves the possibility of a time paradox.  \n\n\n Next. why do we base our movement off of relative things. We have an absolute. 1 absolute. The speed of light. So why do we not call the speed of light a speed of 0. and thus measure our speed by how much slower than the speed of light we are moving, this would not only give us a absolute speed (which has never been done)  It would give us a better foundation to understand special relativity, and time dilation.  \n\n\nFinally, is it possible that as ...... Information that loses energy, or slows down to the speed of light, that the information falls out of a higher dimension, into the lower dimensions that we can perceive and interact with. Thus explaining why particles sometimes disappear from detection in the LHC,, just to appear in another location.   \n\n\nOh, and I had the thought today that everything in the universe is moving in a mathematical straight line, if you balanced the equations and accounted for the electromagnetic and gravity that everything in the universe would be moving in a straight line perhapse even in a striaght line in the same direction.

The video touches time traveling, butterfly-effects, paradoxical and history structure and how it'd be changed by changing history. \n\nAnd someone replied, \"Why no build a anti-paradox machine?\" - Which begs me the question, is a so called \"anti-paradox machine\" even possible to be build?\n\nMy reply was: \" How would that be possible? Let's just assume that time travel is possible in the first place. You can use time, to go back in time or into the future. But you can't change the fundamentals of time, because without time, there wouldn't be a space(reality). It can be manipulated (meaning go back and forth), but it can't be changed. The way paradox works is that it's changing the reality of it by time, it doesn't changes time it self. It certainly changes history, not time. \n\nSo how would a paradox machine be build, to change reality? Can you even change reality? Isn't reality just a perception we perceived? If then, wouldn't you just changed the way our brain perceive reality? Some sort of drug to (trick) us see the world differently, the live in a different historical world? ( eg. Inception).   So in the end, there would be no 'machine' to anti paradox, or a paradox-machine is just something to trick our mind into believing a different reality.﻿\"\n\nFor all the scientist and thinkers out there.

I have stumbled upon some questions and i would like to share them, I certainly know that I do not have any specific knowledge about quantum mechanics or astrophysics, it is just out curiosity. And apologies for my english.\n\nIf Universe is expanding it should expand in two manner, linear or spherical (correction if any). First case Linear phase: this doesn't logically make me curious. And I don't take this as a base of any hypothesis. 2nd case spherical phase: So imagining a balloon expansion here,\n\nthe surface of balloon as the fabric of space-time. Initially the surface of balloon is soft any matter placed on it would have a specific mass. If it have a greater mass it can easily warp the surface, as worm whole!. as soon as we fill the balloon with air, (or expand our space-time,) surface start to get harder and the matter which was warping the surface till now, wouldn't be able to continue it. So two things happening here, first the actual mass or gravity of the matter starts to decrease (?) And secondly if the universe is expanding continuously like this balloon, any attempt to warp the space-time will be harder and harder as expansion continue. Maybe the first hypothesis is just a naive assessment, but im really curious about the second one.\n\nConsidering a point source out of which the universe has began to expand and is continuously being so, what are the properties and conditions of this point source. Is it dead, is it very well alive and continue to throw matter (or dark matter or dar energy?) outward? What is the characteristics of the space-time at that very location? is it warped at infinity, does it have such enormous gravity or anti-gravity? And lastly\n\nWhat is the thing that is actually pushing the matter away from each other, what is this enormous energy? Or 4. Is Universe really expanding?",

You and you alone were left floating at a single point in the vacuum? Provided you had a space suit and went into suspended animation that could last indefinably, where if anywhere would you go?\n\nI say you would basically go nowhere. You would stay put at that exact point in space because the gravitational pull of the nearest star, Alpha Centauri, would never be strong enough to pull you in, even over millennia or eons. And if you did move due to its gravity, it would almost be immeasurable over those eons.\n\nMy coworker on the other hand thinks that the gravitational pull of our nearest star neighbor would, even though the gravitational force is infinitesimal, eventually pull you in.\n\nWe got started on this little debate because I had read to him that if you were to shoot a bullet into the darkness of space, it would never actually hit anything because the mass in the universe is expanding at a faster rate than that bullet is traveling.\n\nAnyway, without wasting too much of your time, could you/would you, please shed a some light on the physics involved in that little thought experiment?
