I am having the school help me search for internships for the summer but as the title says I have been having extreme anxiety. \n\nI have done all the C++, Java and Visual Basic classes required and I use Java for my personal projects and it is the main language I use. I want to become really good with Java rather than know a little about each language as for a beginner I feel that would make me more valuable. I have been using Java for about 2 years. \n\nLooking back on my beginner projects its obvious that I have come far since then. I recently finished an ftp application and am now working on a bus business system. Some days I really think I am doing good but a lot of the time I never feel like I'll know enough when the time comes to shine. \n\nAnyone else experiencing or experienced this? Sorry if this is posted in the wrong place. It's my first post. \n\nThanks!",

        "title": "Bug of the month",
        "author": "Tatyanazaxarova",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/61sim6/bug_of_the_month/",
        "text": "Recently we published 2 articles about TOP 10 errors in C++ and C# projects found in 2016. We got very positive feedback and that made us think - why not to make such a top rating of bugs for a month? Our site has a huge base of errors that is well-structured and that we can use to choose bugs, which were detected during a certain period of time. In this article you will learn about the new blog section \"Bug of the month\" and how we prepared articles for it.\n\nSome may say that Gimpel Software has already had such a [blog](http://www.gimpel.com/html/bugs.htm) and we just borrowed their idea. But this is really not the case. What we have in common is the title and the fact that we make a post about a bug once a month.\n\nBut, although, in Gimpel Software there is really a number next to the diagnostic, the code provided there is artificially created as some kind of a puzzle with quite an amusing description. For example: \"Santa and his elves are automating their Christmas delivery system. But one of the elves has made a critical error causing, in some areas, the actions to appear in an unexpected order\". or: \"Shawn O'Flaherty, perhaps a bit tipsy when he wrote this, is preparing a program for his pub's annual St. Patrick's Day celebration. Although not finished, there's already a bit of a problem\".  Also, they suggest finding this bug and checking yourself if you were right in solving the problem.\n\nWhat we do is that we show bugs found only in open source projects, checked in several past years. We also tried choosing those bugs that would be understandable for all readers, not only experts. For example, these can be all favorite copy-paste or various typos that we find almost in all projects. Besides the code fragment, we also cite the text of the diagnostic, which the analyzer used to detect the problem. Below the post there is a link to the article about the check of the project, where you can see other bugs found in this project.\n\nAs it is written on the official site of Gimpel Software, their first \"bug of the month\" was found in March 1991 and the list continued to be replenished for 21 years. At one time they were very popular and promoted PC-Lint rather actively. Since 2012, the updates for this blog stopped, but the developers hope that \"bug of the month\" can be started again in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, we decided to take the baton from PC-Lint and create our own \"bug of the month\" ~~with blackja..~~ using open source projects and errors we find in them.\n\nSo, we reviewed a large number of projects that we checked from January 2014 to March and selected 54 interesting bugs: 39 for the C/C++ language and 15 for C#, because we started the C# support only in 2016. The table gets constantly updated and it can be found by this link: [https://hownot2code.com/bug-of-the-month/](https://hownot2code.com/bug-of-the-month/).\n\nAs it was already said, we reviewed our existing [error base](https://www.viva64.com/en/examples/) and the [always up-to-date list of open source projects](https://www.viva64.com/en/inspections/). Perhaps, these materials would be interesting and also useful to the readers, as they can be used as recommendations of how to avoid the same errors, they may also help in doing some researches, related to the improvement of the software reliability and even for working on the code standards. \n\nThe existence of a large amount of errors in the code (especially in big projects) can be explained by the fact that it's not always possible to hold the attention and control every line of code, especially when there are thousands of them. This is how Copy-paste errors, undefined behavior, null pointer dereference, typos and other errors get in the code. They could all be avoided with the help of static analysis. \n\nTo make the number of such bugs less and improve the quality of the code, we suggest [downloading](https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio-download/) and trying PVS-Studio on your project. Who knows, may be you will find your own bug of the month and will tell about it the community of developers to protect them from such errors. For now, you could also practise your bug searching skills and look for bugs in well-known Open Source projects.\n\nSo, welcome: [Bug of the month!](https://hownot2code.com/bug-of-the-month/)\n\n",

        "text": "Micro-clones are tiny duplicated pieces of code; they typically comprise only few statements or lines. In this paper, we study the \"Last Line Effect,\" the phenomenon that the last line or statement in a micro-clone is much more likely to contain an error than the previous lines or statements. We do this by analyzing 219 open source projects and reporting on 263 faulty micro-clones and interviewing six authors of real-world faulty micro-clones. In an interdisciplinary collaboration, we examine the underlying psychological mechanisms for the presence of these relatively trivial errors. Based on the interviews and further technical analyses, we suggest that so-called \"action slips\" play a pivotal role for the existence of the last line effect: Developers' attention shifts away at the end of a micro-clone creation task due to noise and the routine nature of the task. Moreover, all micro-clones whose origin we could determine were introduced in unusually large commits. Practitioners benefit from this knowledge twofold: 1) They can spot situations in which they are likely to introduce a faulty micro-clone and 2) they can use PVS-Studio, our automated micro-clone detector, to help find erroneous micro-clones.\n\nFull Article: [The last line effect explained](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-016-9489-6)",

Having checked a large number of open source projects, we have seen a large variety of ways to shoot yourself in the foot; there is definitely much to share with the readers.
