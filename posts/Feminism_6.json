        "text": "I'm 18 y/o, I'm from an Arab country, being sexist here is the norm, which already makes life hard enough, but having a mother, which is a woman herself being sexist is on a different level of hard.\n\nShe's overprotective, very controlling, she doesn't acknowledge me as an independent person, she sees me as some extension of her, I have to follow her rules and her beliefs, or I'm \"misbehaving\".\n\nShe only asks me to help her around the house and when I tell her why can't me and my brother help around together she says that I'm the girl, and that my brother is not supposed to work around the house, so, I stopped helping around the house, I only clean my room now.\n\nShe controls what I wear, where I go, who I talk to (she doesn't allow me to be friends with the guys of my country in particular, and she gets quite mad when she sees me on a video call with a foreign guy as well but she's less strict with it).\n\nShe won't let me find a job, so I'm completely financially dependent on her, I also can't move out until I get married.\n\n\nAnd now my boyfriend (who is obviously not a native..) is visiting my country for the first time this summer and he really wants to finally meet me irl, we called soo many times, I know who I'm with and he knows me well enough as well, we're also gonna meet in a public place, and even if that was a not so good person he wouldn't have the balls to hurt me in my own country, when I told my mom this she said I can't go see a guy alone and that she'll take my brother and go with me but sit at a different table let's say we're in a restaurant, which is just not okay, I need my privacy.\n\n\nI tried talking to her in every way, every single one would end up with her saying that I'm the controlling one (for wanting to have control over my own life) and that she's doing nothing wrong and she won't change.\n\nI'm frustrated, I'm also dealing with depression and anxiety, and living with her is not helping.\n\nShe also used to get really violent, she'd pull me out of my room through my hair, she'd give me scratches over my arms, I'd wake up with my whole body feeling bruised the day after, and she even hit me with a stick once and gave my bruises all over my legs.\n\nShe's been violent throughout my whole childhood and only stopped a little less than a year ago, but I'd expect her to get back to it if I make a mistake that's bad enough.\n\n\nPlease, I need advice on what to do, I've been told to keep a low profile till I find a way out of my country, but I just can't take this anymore, I just want her to let me breathe.\n\n\nEdit: for some reason all the comments on this post are getting deleted except that one I replied to, I'm grateful to all the comments tho, I read the first half of them from the notifications, I just think I need to clear something up, traveling rn just isn't an option for me, I'm way too broke to travel on my own cause as I said I don't have a job, and my mom wouldn't pay for it either for the mere fact that I became an atheist and she's scared I might do \"the unspeakable\" if I leave the country.",
