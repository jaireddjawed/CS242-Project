        "text": "This post is based on the latest trailer for Battlefield 1, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymwXbF1VTKU. While most of the trailer's focused on the game's representation of the fighting in the Middle East, there's a short clip of a naval engagement starting at around 1:19. This gets several things wrong about WW1 naval combat.\n\nThe first thing we'll look at are in [this](http://i.imgur.com/al0BSLI.png) screencap from the start of the clip. In the image, we can see several torpedo boats and aircraft moving in to attack a dreadnought battleship. The battleship is a British King George V class, which can be seen from the pair of funnels forward of the midships turret, as well as the general superstructure design (providing a pleasing symmetry with Battlefield 1942, where the Allied battleship was the class's eponymous successor). The torpedo boats are Italian MAS boats - the low superstructure with a curving cutaway aft is a clear giveaway. This throws up an obvious issue: the Italians and British were on the same side. Even if we ignore this, the use of MAS boats was mostly limited to the Mediterranean, while the KGVs spent the war with the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. The Germans had their own designs for motor boats, including torpedo launching and explosive designs. Additionally, British dreadnought battleships were typically not risked close to a hostile coast where MTBs were a major threat. However, this is only a minor flaw, as there was a case where MTBs attacked and sank a dreadnought battleship. On the 10th June 1918, two Italian MAS boats attacked an Austro-Hungarian force off the Croatian coast. They managed to hit the dreadnought *Szent István* with two torpedoes, causing major flooding. *Szent István* sank two and a half hours after receiving her first hit. This somewhat justifies their inclusion of both battleships and torpedo boats, though I question their choice of craft.\n\nLess justifiable is their inclusion and use of aircraft. On the one hand, the First World War did see a major increase in the use of airpower at sea. By 1918, aircraft were carrying anti-submarine patrols, attacking shipping, and flying strikes against land targets from early carriers. However, the game looks to greatly overstate these capabilities, and misrepresents the way they would be used. \n\nThe trailer focuses on a torpedo carrying aircraft, the belly of which can be seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/ZeJgxCk.png), with its torpedo. Torpedo carrying aircraft saw their genesis in WW1. The first such aircraft was the British Short 184 seaplane. Deployed to Gallipoli in 1915 aboard the seaplane carrier *Ben-My-Chree*, they saw several successes. On the 12 August 1915, an aircraft flown by Flight Commander Charles Edmonds attacked and sank a Turkish merchant, which had previously been torpedoed by the submarine E14. Five days later, he torpedoed another Turkish steamer, while his wingman, a Flight Lieutenant Dacre, sank a tugboat. However, the latter sinking demonstrated the limitations of the Short 184 - the torpedo weighed about as much as the aircraft could carry. Forced to land by engine trouble, Dacre had to taxi on the surface of the water to get into position to drop his torpedo, allowing him to take off. To replace the Short 184, the RN began to work on landplane aircraft, capable of operating from the carriers they were developing. Aircraft developed for this use include the Sopwith Cuckoo, Short Shirl and Blackburn Blackburd, all similar single-engined biplanes. Meanwhile, the Germans were organising squadrons of torpedo planes. These carried out attacks on British shipping in the North Sea, with their first attack sinking SS Gena off the Suffolk coast in 1916. The German torpedo planes were almost entirely large seaplanes. All of these aircraft are completely different from the aircraft portrayed in the trailer - as seen in [this image](http://i.imgur.com/mIQbAYK.png) it's a single-engined pusher landplane. The German aircraft had two engines, and were seaplanes. The British torpedo planes were single-engined, but in a tractor configuration. As such, the aircraft in game does not represent any of the major torpedo planes used in the war.\n\nIn terms of use, torpedo planes of WW1 were mostly used to attack merchant shipping, as opposed to their use against battleships as in the trailer. The Germans used theirs to attack British coastal shipping in the North Sea. As discussed earlier, the RN bombers from *Ben-My-Chree* targeted Turkish merchants in the Dardanelles and Sea of Marmara. This selection of targets resulted from the limitations of the aircraft and tactics available. The aircraft were generally too slow to attack fast-moving warships - a Short 184 or German Albatros W.5 might have only a 50 knot margin over a battleship moving at top speed. In contrast, the notoriously slow Douglas Devastator of WW2 had a speed advantage of 140 knots, while the biplane Fairey Swordfish had a speed advantage twice that of its WW1 counterparts. Plans to use torpedo bombers against warships aimed to catch a fleet in port. The RN had the most advanced such plan, utilising their new carriers and the Sopwith Cuckoo designed for them, but were unable to carry it out before the end of the war. The first formulation of this plan, created in 1917, called for a grand attack by eight carriers on the German High Seas Fleet in Wilhelmshaven. However, the Admiralty was unwilling to provide the resources for it, and this version of the plan was quashed. It would be resurrected on a smaller scale in late 1918, as *Vindictive* and *Argus* joined *Furious* in the RN's carrier arsenal. However, the war would end before the plan could be put into action. How close it came to completion can be seen in the card sent at Christmas 1918 by the officers of the RAF's torpedo bomber unit. It had a picture of the High Seas Fleet, along with the words 'Oh, that we might have met'. This was the closest any dreadnought came to being attacked by a torpedo bomber in WW1. It's a situation that the game does not seem to represent well - the German fleet would have been surprised at anchor, rather than being attacked while at sea. \n\nThis analysis has left out a couple of minor errors that seem evident from the trailer. The battleship does not have the escort you'd expect - dreadnoughts were not something risked lightly without the protection given by  destroyers and cruisers. The effect of the torpedoes appears to tend more towards fire and surface explosions, rather than the waterspouts expected from underwater explosions. All this creates the impression of a game that has sacrificed historical accuracy in favour of creating an exciting, shocking spectacle. \n\nSources:\n\n*The Royal Naval Air Service in the First World War*, Philip Jarrett, Pen and Sword Aviation, 2015\n\n*British Carrier Aviation: The Evolution of the Ships and Their Aircraft*, Norman Friedman, Naval Institute Press, 1988\n\n*British Aircraft Carriers: Design, Development &amp; Service Histories*, David Hobbs, Seaforth, 2013\n\n*Fighting the Great War at Sea: Strategy, Tactics and Technology*, Norman Friedman, Seaforth, 2014\n\n\n ",

        "text": "If you were born in the USSR, chances are you would be familiar with the song called *Smuglyanka* or \"The Swarthy Girl,\" [which you can listen to here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awUV3J7CKwo). The gist of the song is that a young man tried to hit on a dark haired cutie and she responded by recruiting him to join the Partisans. The cheery tune made the song a favorite across the USSR and it was often played on TV and in private after a few rounds of vodka. However, in later years, some people attacked the historiography behind the song. In 2008, Alexander Statiev, a professor at the University of Waterloo, published an article cleverly titled: \"Was Smuglianka a Lunatic or a Siguranţa's Agent-Provocateur? Peculiarities of the Soviet Partisan Struggle in the Western Borderlands.\"^(1)\n\nStatiev begins his article with the following introduction:\n&gt;Every  Russian  knows  the  Soviet  wartime  song  ‘Smuglianka’.  The heroine of that song, Smuglianka, a swarthy Moldovan girl, encourages her Russian boyfriend to join the Soviet partisans. Was it advice given in  good  faith  or  was  it  a  trap  set  by  the  Romanian  secret  police Siguranța that  sought  to  test  the  loyalty  of  young  men?  While  the consumers  of  Soviet  mass  culture  presumed  the  former, archival documents tend to support the latter assumption. Moldova remained partisan-free throughout its occupation by Romania. In the summer of 1941, the Communist Party sought to ignite a partisan movement in Moldova but all units it hastily assembled disintegrated within days.\n\nWhat follows is a rather interesting discussion of the Soviet struggle to organize loyal resistance movements in its Western hinterlands. In particular, he shows that such movements were almost completely absent in Moldova, or more precisely in the region of [Bessarabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessarabia). As Statiev explains, this state of affairs was hardly shocking. Romanians treated Bessarabia not as an occupied territory, but as an integral part of Romania inhabited by ethnic Romanians. The local population saw things, mostly in the same way. At least as far as ethnic Romanians were concerned, it was the Soviets who were the detested occupants who ripped Bessarabia away from Romania in 1940 as part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The fact that the occupation was followed by forced collectivization of the land and [a wave of deportations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_deportations_from_Bessarabia_and_Northern_Bukovina) only exacerbated matters. Needless to say, when Romanian administration returned on the heels of Operation Barbarossa, few Moldovans were eager to resist the Romanian/German administration by fighting for the Soviets.  \n\nSo far the author's point appears to be pretty solid, so why am I submitting his article here? The problem is that the song is not about World War II at all! The first clue for that should be that the song was written in 1940, a year before the start of the Nazi-Soviet war. In reality, the song was not about WWII at all, but about the Russian Civil War two decades earlier.^2 When the USSR took Bessarabia in 1940, they wanted to make the annexation more palatable to Moldovans. One approach was to create propaganda about the (mostly apocryphal) participation of Moldovan peasants on the side of Red Army forces during the Russian Civil War. Smuglyanka was one such fictional heroine who fought against the bourgeoisie on behalf of the Soviet workers and peasants. Interestingly enough, *Smuglyanka* didn't make the cut for the final suite since the song was deemed too tawdry. It was only in 1975 that the song crossed into the mainstream when it was included in a feature film called \"[Only Old Men Go Into Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Old_Men_Are_Going_to_Battle).\" The rest as they say is history....\n\nSo in the end, the author of that article wasn't necessarily wrong, but he was right for the wrong reasons. It's true that few Moldovans, female or otherwise, participated in any kind of Partisan movement. Nevertheless, *Smuglyanka* was written in 1940 and using the lack of Soviet resistance in Moldova during WWII as a counter-argument is simply beside the point. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n1.

        "text": "It's been a long time! Today's badhistory comes from both the Smithsonian ([The Robe Volante, the First Comfortable Dress in France, Sells for $150,000](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/robe-volante-first-comfortable-dress-france-sells-150000-180960089)) and NPR ([Vive Le Confort! For Corseted Courtiers, This Dress Was A French Revolution](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/09/489179987/vive-le-confort-for-corseted-courtiers-this-dress-was-a-french-revolution)).\n\nThe gist: the Palais Galleria museum recently purchased an early 18th century gown for $150,000. It is what fashion historians generally call a *robe volante* (though there were multiple terms used at the time - *andrienne*, from a play in which it appeared; *contouche*, \"sack\", *manteau*), a casual type of dress that doesn't survive the years very well because the fabric - being pretty much long rectangles pleated at the shoulders - was so easily reusable.\n\nThe problems:\n\n&gt;For women, that meant luxurious fabric and tiny waistlines enforced by stiff, tight bodices. Courtiers had to be as formal and magnificent as possible. \"Court dress was obligatory,\" says de Jean. \"[Louis XIV's] idea was to have a look of the French court — that they were to look all the same. All formal, [so that] when his court was gathered around him, there would be this uniform style.\" In court, stylish women did a lot of standing around — all the bindings made it too hard to sit. But by the end of the 17th century, the formality began to wear thin and the magnificence became a burden.\n\n&gt;And so a fashion revolution was born: Down with the corsets and cages! Up with the robe volante! Full and comfy, in fancy fabrics or simple cottons, everyone could wear it — and they did. The \"revolutionaries\" were young women of the court, merchants and dressmakers; the robe became a social leveler. Visitors arriving in Paris found they couldn't tell who was who, de Jean says. Women could move differently. They could sit and lounge, cross their legs — even show a bit of leg. Painters started fixating on ankles and shins, showing the leg as \"an object of desire,\" says de Jean.\n\nThe most obvious issue here is the idea that \"all the bindings made it too hard to sit\" was the reason courtiers did a lot of standing. The etiquette of Louis XIV's court was very strict, with intricate rules about who could sit in front of whom - in general, being allowed to sit in the presence of royalty indicated very high rank. For instance, \"Gaston d'Orléans, as uncle to the king, was always entitled to an armchair except before the King, when he was restricted to a folding stool. Mazarin, as a cardinal, was obliged to stand in the King's presence, but could sit upon a folding stool before the Queen, Orléans, and the Dauphin.\" ([x](https://books.google.com/books?id=1VOxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27)) Then we come to the actual physical aspect: the court bodice only affected the torso, and wouldn't interfere with anyone's ability to sit. \n\nThe \"cages\" in the statement \"Down with the corsets and cages!\" also implies some form of skirt support trapping the legs, but during the reign of Louis XIV there was no hoop or pannier that was part of court dress. (Even when those were fashionable, there is ample visual evidence of [women sitting in them](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gainsborough-mr-and-mrs-carter-t12609).)\n\nWhere both of these articles on the subject really fall down is that they ignore a) the rise of privacy as a status marker and b) women in France being allowed to sew the *volante*.\n\nRegarding A: In the late 17th century, houses began to be constructed with bedrooms arranged along corridors rather than leading from one to the next, railroad-style, to allow the rooms to be more private spaces. Royalty began to stop receiving audiences in their bedrooms as well. (See Lucy Worsley's *If Walls Could Talk: An Intimate History of the Home*.) Informal portraits showing the sitter as someone with the leisure to lounge were as important as ones in full court dress that displayed the sitter's wealth. The popularity of the sack as a gown and as an eroticized costume for a painting is in part a result of this, rather than the cause of all informality.\n\nRegarding B: French seamstresses formed a guild in 1675, and were permitted to make the basic elements of women's clothing, but not the boned bodices and trained skirts which made up court and formal dress, which required a lot of time and knowledge to fit, and were therefore very expensive. According to Clare Haru Crowston in *Fabricating Women: the Seamstresses of Old Regime France*, it's most likely that this was to help the tailors' guild keep its rank as the most important and lucrative part of the garment industry. When the sack came into play, the seamstresses were able to exploit the popularity of the gown - which, in a belted fashion that developed into the mantua of the 18th century, was the standard dress for women during the last quarter of the century - and rise to become much more powerful. I suppose it's not as sexy as crossed legs and ankles? But in my opinion it's more significant, and its omission makes me sad.\n\nAnd, as Crowston reminded me when I was checking for the last paragraph, the gown actually brought back the separate boned stays worn as a foundation garment (as they had been before they merged into the dress bodice earlier in the century) rather than abolishing the corset in general.",

        "text": "So I was excited as fuck when Battlefield 1 was announced because WW1 is criminally under-represented in games. Snoopy's Flying Aces makes up a good quarter of WW1 representation in Video Games. I thought the Battlefield franchise would be very well-suited to a WW1 game since has large open maps with lots of players and vehicles. It also (relative to Call of Duty) tries to balance a small degree of realism with gamification to emphasize having a good time over...whatever the fuck Call of Duty is now. \n\nAs a disclaimer I haven't played the game yet, but what I've seen from watching streams has been extremely disappointing. I'd like to talk a bit about the weapons because it seems to me that how the firearms are handled in this game is lazy. Instead of building the mechanics to suit the firearms of the era they did that thing *every game developer making a game set before 1939* does and just comes up with weapons that fit a modern conflict with little regard to historicity. It's not that these weapons are made up, but their role and function is overstated. Remember when darkest of days let you fire a musket once at the battle of Antietam then gave you a Henry repeater and a Revolver as a stop gap until you got a space assault rifle? No you're right I shouldn't expect anyone to remember that game.\n\nRegardless because I'm a lazy asshole I will be using this article linked [here](https://www.vg247.com/2016/05/11/battlefield-1-every-weapon-confirmed-so-far/) as the only source out of sheer laziness. \n\nThe article itself has some...well:\n\n&gt;There may be some concerns that the World War One setting of Battlefield 1 might restrict the amount of weapons and gear available to players, or that it could be a step back from the devastating weaponry we’ve grown used to in previous games.\n\nThis demonstrates the problem with Battlefield 1: they are letting the consumer decide that the game should be Battlefield 4, set in modern times, but with old timey skins. Also WW1 had plenty of devastating weaponry just not akimbo fully-automatic shotguns. \n\nIt goes on (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;But what this early 20th Century setting brings is a blend of early mass-produced firepower alongside the previous century’s more primitive weapons. That’s why the figure on the key art for Battlefield 1 stands with a **semi-automatic pistol and a mace**.\n\nFucking what? Like sure its a transitional era but it's not like in 1899 modern militaries were using maces en masse...or at all. Also the pistol in the cover art is a Mauser C96, which was designed and produced in the primitive \"previous century.\"\n\nPoor history from the venerated vg247.com aside, we finally get to some weapons!!\n\n&gt;Spiked mace\nTrench spade\nBolo knife: available in the Harlem Hellfighter pre-order pack in the Deluxe Edition\nJambiya dagger: available in the Lawrence of Arabia pack in the Deluxe Edition\nScimitar\nBayonet\n\nThis isn't horrible I suppose, I had to look it up to make sure but there was indeed a case of a bolo knife being used by the Harlem Hellfighters, from wikipedia's article on the 369th Infrantry: \n\n\"After they expended their ammunition, Roberts used his rifle as a club and Johnson battled with a bolo knife. Reports suggest that Johnson killed at least four German soldiers and might have wounded 30 others.\"\n\nI don't know particularly much about the Scimitar and Dagger use, perhaps someone else can tell us if these were particularly common in that theater.\n\nOn to the fun shit! \n\n...oh fuck this article is from May and only has like 8 weapons shown\n\nAlright lets switch to [this PC gamer article from July](http://www.pcgamer.com/up-close-with-every-class-weapon-in-the-battlefield-1-alpha/) for an actual weapons list we can work with:\n\nLets get one thing out of the way first: many of these weapons are from 1918. This is a 4 year war with millions of men but weapons manufactured in the final year are apparently representative of the entire conflict. k.\n\n&gt;Automatico M1918\n\n&gt; ...The overhead magazine and rapid chamber reset of the bolt on the right side are an authentic touch that adds character to an otherwise routine weapon.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A ROUTINE WEAPON IN WW1, THIS IS A ROUTINE WEAPON IN BATTLEFIELD GAMES. This is a weapon that wasn't deployed until 1918, 3 years into the war and abit over 2 years into Italy's participation. Do you see what I mean about same weapons as a modern-era Battlefield game just with new skins? \n\nAlso the GIF associated with this weapon appears to be a player shooting at a zepplin with it...\n\n&gt;Model 10-A\n\n&gt; It’s almost useless in the majority of Battlefield’s wide open spaces, but if you stick to cover and flank unnoticed, it’ll drop a soldier with one shot. It’s also great for defense. If the enemy is assaulting your position, hole up in a house or bunker with one of these and take them by surprise. Shots look like a barely controlled explosion, which isn’t authentic, but Battlefield 1 doesn’t seem too worried about realism. The 10-A was rarely used in WWI anyway, as most opted for the Winchester Model 1897.\n\nStop doing my work for me you assholes!\n\n&gt;MP 18\n\nAgain, this is a 1918 SMG, and while it was used in combat its estimated only 10,000 were ever made.\n\n&gt;a weapon that made such an impression on the Allies that further study and manufacture of such weapons by Germany was banned in the Treaty of Versaille.\n\nWhy does the SMG protestations get a mention and not the Germans complaining about Trench guns? Also *Versaille*?\n\n&gt;But the MP 18 slipped through those cracks, and became the basis for most SMG design until the 60s.\n\nDude did you read your own writing? \"further study and manufacture of such weapons **by Germany**\" \n\n&gt; it’s still fun to fire on top of a zeppelin.\n\nThis is speculative and reductionist, I expect better historiography from pcgamer\n\n&gt;Cei-Rigotti\n\nMOTHER FU-\n\n&gt;This long to medium-range automatic/semi-auto rifle wasn’t actually adopted by any nation in WWI—it was a prototype created by Italian officer Amerigo Cei-Rigotti. But Battlefield wanted a few early automatic rifles in the mix, so here we are.\n\n-CKER. Why even *bother* making a WW1 game? Just add in golden desert eagles. \n\n&gt;Even though automatic rifles were used in WWI (e.g. the BAR), they lend more of a WWII flavor to me, and I’ve mostly avoided them so far. Semi-auto and bolt action are where it’s at\n\nPeople playing this game need to *avoid* mechanics to even attempt authenticity. Also does the BAR feel ww2-esque because it was in service in DICE's favorite year, 1918?\n\n&gt;M1907 SL\n\nAyyy a weapon from not 1918!\n\nI'd never heard of this weapon before, I assume based on some googling that since you can get a fully-automatic version in the game that it must be the french version. Which is pretty funny when you consider that *the french aren't a playable nation,* Wikipedia says the French were the most notable purchaser of this weapon with a massive....2,200 ordered, nearly double the number of these weapons used by the other allies. \n\n&gt;The design is a bit plain compared to BF1’s other guns\n\nfuck you\n\nmoving right along:\n\n&gt;Mondragon\n\nI like the Mondragon! I came across it when I was studying the Assault Rifle mexico is currently developing. I wonder how common it was in WW1, surely since its not from 1918 (year 0 in the DICE timeline) it was widely used right? \n\nHA no. Less than 4,000 were ever used.\n\n&gt;Overall, the medic guns are a decent way to defend yourself when lying prone near a point, or coming at one from a distance, **but they aren’t for clearing houses.**\n\nNor indeed were Medics...\n\n&gt;Lewis Gun\n\nI have never in my life seen photographic evidence that soldiers were walking around firing the Lewis gun from the hip like Rambo. I could be wrong here but weren't subsequent LMGs/Automatic rifles designed for walking fire to offset how the Lewis gun could not reasonably do this?\n\n&gt; the Lewis Gun isn’t a huge damage dealer. It’s super accurate and great for suppressing enemy infantry, but in a one-on-one shootout, the firing rate and damage output may not be enough.\n\nisn't suppression and damage output the...point of an LMG? If only they had the Italian anti-zeppelin SMG from earlier!\n\nThe other two LMGs are the Hotchkiss Gun and the Madsen gun, my only complains about the mobility and firepower of the Lewis gun also apply here.\n\nNow we arrive at the Scout class, which is the sniper role. Here we *finally* start to see the actual fucking service rifles these armies used in....an extremely specialized role...\n\nThese rifles are *service* rifles, The rifles they list are the Gewehr 98, the Lee-Enfield, and the Russian Winchester (I assume this is the Winchester lever-action rifle that the Russians ordered from the US not that it matters since the Russians aren't in the fucking game either) were rifles that your average infantryman would be carrying for much of the war (except the Winchester), not SMGs and Trench Guns and random self-loading weapons with 200 models in service in 1918.\n\n\n\nTo sum up: This is a Battlefield game, not a WW1 game. Weapons were selected to fit the classes, not the other way around. Weapons from that era were cherry picked to emulate games set in this era, and its extremely disappointing. If you want a vaguely better WW1 game here's a little [flash game.](http://armorgames.com/play/2267/warfare-1917)\n\n-edit- some spelling, some shit about a mauser\n\n",

Not even close; at the time of the Temple's demise in 1978, the main outposts were in San Fransisco/Ukiah area, Los Angeles, and Jonestown. Peoples Temple did have college dormitories over at Santa Rosa, and they did travel across the country by bus on occasion, but those were the main outposts.\n\nThey also pronounced Guyana wrong, but that's just bad pronunciation. \n\n[2:36](https://youtu.be/7nzl7YrR7e4?t=2m36s)\n\n&gt; On November 17th, 1978, as Ryan and the group [of defectors] were at the local airport [...]\n\nWow.

November 18, day of the mass deaths and murder.\n\nAlso, Port Kaituma was less of an airport and more of a dirt field masquerading as a airstrip.

        "text": "From /r/Worldnews we get the claim that: [The surrounding countries created Belgium themselves, the country itself didn't want to exist in the first place - deal with it](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4wgb9o/key_belgian_isis_recruiter_who_sent_5_of_her_own/d66u014).\n\nThis statement couldn't be more wrong, and I'll cover them point by point below. \n\n**The Kingdom of the Netherlands** \n\nThe claim that the country was created artificially is probably in reference to the outcome of the Congress of Vienna which was set up to deal with the situation in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars. It is true that most of the decisions made were made by the great powers (left) in Europe and in many cases it shuffled bits of land about, not always with consideration for the people living there, but it did not create Belgium. What it did do is create a new state called United Kingdom of the Netherlands which (roughly) consisted of the older states of the Dutch Republic, the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, and the Austrian Netherlands (and Luxembourg, but that's a slightly more complicated story). Or going back a bit further, the 16th century borders of the Habsburg Netherlands. \n\nThe area that is now Belgium was never a happy partner in this setup though. From the start the Catholic Church in the south forbade anyone from participating in the Kingdom's government, and the situation deteriorated over time to a point where the south rebelled against Dutch rule in 1830. The causes aren't exactly relevant for this post, but in short were a mix of factors ranging from economic dominance of the north, fear of the protestant north repressing the catholic Belgians, language policies, unequal representation in governing bodies, and a pretty autocratic (also northern and protestant) Dutch king called William I who was a bit old fashioned when it came to this whole modern malarkey of sharing power with some commoners.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bye Bye Netherlands, hello Belgium**\n\nAt the end of 1830 the Belgian rebels established the National Congress of Belgium and in 1831 they themselves proclaimed their constitution and decided to become a constitutional monarchy (with the position of monarch open for the time being). The Dutch did try to regain the south by military means, and while successful against the nascent Belgian army, the presence of French armed forces did cause them to halt the advance for fear of escalating the campaign into a war with France. Because the Dutch king was kind of stubborn, he didn't recognise the Belgian state until 1839, but the country existed de facto from 1831 onwards. \n\nWe can see this in the way Belgium started to participate in international conferences as an independent party. The so called \"Treaty of the Eighteen Articles\" which was a proposed peace plan from 1831 was accepted by Belgium, but not the Netherlands, mainly because of opposition by William I. But finally the Treaty of London from 1839 finally created an official peace between the countries, recognition for Belgium as an independent state by all European powers, and settled the whole affair of finalising the borders of each state (and Luxembourg, but as said, that's a bit more complicated). The only condition on the new state set by international powers was that it were to be a neutral power. (For more on this neutrality clause see WWI, specifically the entry of the UK into the war). So the Belgians definitely \"created\" their own country by rebelling against the Dutch. It wasn't done for them behind closed doors by the Great and Powerful, their country was born in a fight for independence by the Belgians themselves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**On identity and claims of artificiality**\n\nOne further point I'd like to make is that while I said \"Belgium created itself in 1830\" above, if we're looking back a bit it's not really \"create\" as much as \"recreate\" themselves. The area that's now roughly Belgium remained under Spanish rule in the 80 Year War that lead to the independence of the Dutch Republic. While some cities switched back and forth during the war, the south mostly remained part of Spain as \"The Spanish Netherlands\" during the war and after. And they had developed its own identity and some degree of own independence already in the 16th century with it's own States General and laws. Even further back the previously mentioned Habsburg Netherlands had its own privileges and some degree of independence already, so the south basically continued as before, while the north gained complete independence. \n\nSo this whole claim of the country being an artificial construct is even more flawed. If you look at the borders of the Spanish Netherlands at the time of the Peace of Westphalia (1648), you will notice that they are surprisingly similar to those of the current Kingdoms of the Netherlands and Belgium. The main changes center around Limburg and Luxembourg (seriously, don't ask). But Belgium drew the short stick with having France as a neighbour, so you'll see some losses there over the years after they gained independence.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Finally**\n\nSo in conclusion the country:\n\n- Most certainly did want to exist, otherwise they never would have rebelled and fought long and hard to leave the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \n- Furthermore it created itself. The borders were settled by international treaties, but this was pretty normal procedure for the time and Belgium was a part of the negotiations right from the start in 1831. \n- Also it isn't as artificial a nation as some people want you to believe, it existed as an area with considerable autonomy already since the Habsburg days. And during Spanish rule this continued, with the area developing its own identity separate from the north.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**For more reading:**\n\nThe Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806 - Jonathan Israel (got this one from the AH reading list and it gives a good overview of the situation before, during, and after the 80 Year War, focussing mostly on the Republic itself. It sets the scene as to why the Habsburg Netherlands ended up being so different that eventually they'd split between the north and south) \n\nDe tachtigjarige oorlog: opstand en consolidatie in de Nederlanden (1559-1650) - S.

They were harsh and overcrowded camps used to combat guerillas and house refugees but they weren't designed to extreminate political enemies or a certain race. Concentrations camps are pretty much syonmous with 'extermination camps' now so saying the Nazis weren't the first to have such camps, the British were, and that the Germans just did it more efficeintly is both flippant and inaccurate.\n\n&gt; Some of the camps in Nazi Germany were the 'old' style concentration camps from the Boer War, but the famous ones related to the Holocaust were death camps. You might be 'technically' correct but given that you understand the connotations that concentration camp has when talking about Nazi Germany is it misleading to only mention the similarities and not the differences. It's kind of like comparing the Holocaust and Stalin's political respression, they were both evil acts that killed lots of people, but as far as mass murder and repressoin goes they were actually pretty different in motivation, methods, justification and so on.\n\n&gt; It's kind of like the British didn't care if people died in acheiving their aims but didn't go out their way to kill them once they were no longer a threat to the war. That is what these type of camps are often like. But the extermination of Jews and other 'lesser peoples' was almost an end in itself in Nazi ideology, they didn't just not care about them, they actively tried to kill them.\n\n&gt; But the thing is even if you insist on saying the British were the forerunners to the Holocaust they were only following in the footsteps of the US and Spain. Both who used concentration camps as part of their occupation policy in the US. Also check out some of the prisoner of war camps from the US Civil War. Here is a distubrbing picture of a survior from a Confederate camp https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg/800px-Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg\nI actually find it pretty worrying if you genuinely can't tell the difference between all these examples of concentration camps and the actually deliberately genocidal death camps of Nazi Germany and other right-wing regimes. The Germans weren't just doing the job better, they took a barbarous act to a whole new level of callousness and brutality.\n\nFeel free to go gompers on me.",

        "author": "breecher",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4wd1fu/where_18th_century_philadelphian_presses_most/",
        "text": "I stumbled upon [this interesting thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4w26n7/found_a_bible_at_my_work_that_was_printed_3_years/d63sy6i?context=3) where a worker at a recycling place had revovered an 18th century Quaker book.\n\nEnter /u/ClaeytB who certainly knows their fair share of Quaker history. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of printing history, which just happens to be in my field knowledge.\n\nMy interest was mainly aroused by this sentence:\n\n&gt;The bible WAS hand printed as you can tell by the uneven pages, this means that either each page was printed individually which would have been rare, especially for Philly at the time or each page was inserted individually.\n\nAs I thought it was fairly basic knowledge that all printing until the 19th century was carried out with the exact same technology that Gutenberg used in the late 15th hundreds. It was until the 19th century that firstly the cast iron press was developed by Lord Stanhope and then subsequentially an automated press powered by steam.\n\nHowever it was more the details of the description of the printing that caught my attention. Apparently you can tell by this 18th century book that it WAS indeed handprinted because of the \"uneven pages\". As previously noted, every book in the 18th century was hand printed, so you do not need any \"uneven pages\", whatever that means, to tell you that, you just need the date of the book, which was 1779. \n\nThen followed the claim that \"each page was inserted individually\" because if they hadn't then it would mean that  \"each page was printed individually which would have been rare, especially for Philly at the time\". \n\nThis is where it becomes strange. Because anyone with just the basic knowledge of printing prior to the automated press knows that it was carried out with a sheet of blank paper, approximately the size of a small blanket. If printers wanted to print a book the size of an average contemporary paperback, which is the size of the book mentioned in the OP, that would be an octavo size book. So they took this huge sheet of paper and [printed 16 pages of the book in all on both sides of this sheet in such a manner that you could fold the sheet, and then cut the sides open, and it would make 16 pages of a book](http://www.geneticjoycestudies.org/GJS8/Proof%5Efinder/Page.Proofs_files/image002.png). The typesetters are obviously mostly to blame for this, but the printers would need to print twice on that sheet of paper to make those 16 pages. If the printing run of the book was 500, and the book was 200 pages long, they would print 6250 sheets of paper to make 500 books of this format and size. That is a lot of work. And that is also why books rarely exceeded a printing run of 500-1500 during that time unless they were extremely popular or pirated by other presses. It was simply physically impossible, or at least very difficult and expensive to make printing runs larger than this.\n\nWhen the OP was made aware of this they chose to respond like this:\n\n&gt;[By hand printed I should have said hand cut pages. Thus the uneven pages from the book being quickly made. Newsprint in Early America and especially Philadelphia was starting to move past printing individual pages and into a system more like an assembly line.](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4w26n7/found_a_bible_at_my_work_that_was_printed_3_years/d63t8ml)\n\nI am not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I noticed the claim about printing in Philadelphia around the time of the printing of this book (1779) was apparently being to move past \"printing individual pages\" and more into a \"system more like an assembly line\".\n\nWell, first of all, as mentioned, hand printing did not mean printing \"individual pages\". A sheet comprised several pages, 16 in the case of an octavo, and there was no way that you could \"move past\" this process of printing a number of pages per sheet prior to the automated presses of the 19th century, the technology was the same as it had always been and the only way you could multiply your printing run was by adding to your printing presses and not leadt to your printing crew. There was no technological progress being made in this area for centuries, and wouldn't be for decades after the printing of the book in question.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4wcb8t/in_which_crackedcom_cites_a_source_that/",
        "text": "[Relevant cracked article.](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2358-farts-explosions-praying-my-life-as-tank-gunner.html) (See #5)   \n\nThe hyperlink is contained in this line:   \n\n&gt;Early tank models were about as durable as moist toilet paper, and used to catch fire more often than a Catholic church in Norway.   \n\n[Here's](https://warisboring.com/the-m-4-sherman-tank-was-hell-on-wheels-and-a-death-trap-502b0d99e744#.re4h5ypgf) the article they cite as a source.   \n\nThe source starts off with the appealing title of \"The M-4 Sherman Tank Was Hell on Wheels — And a Death Trap.\" And of course, the source quotes Belton Fucking Cooper. The article itself reeks of oft-repeated myths and German propaganda:\n\n&gt;Most tanks at the time ran on diesel, a safer and less flammable fuel than gasoline. The Sherman’s powerplant was a 400-horsepower gas engine that, combined with the ammo on board, could transform the tank into a Hellish inferno after taking a hit.   \n\n&gt;Hence, the Sherman’s grim nickname—Ronson, like the cigarette lighter, because “it lights up the first time, every time.”\n\nSo, this [previous badhistory post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/38gqva/m4_sherman_common_myths/) by /u/Thirtyk94 has already covered myths surrounding the Sherman. I'll just quote relevant bits from it to explain how fucking stupid this whole article is. For one, the myth of Shermans easily catching fire was due to the poor placement of ammunition, which was later rectified, and is nowhere near as ridiculous as the source states it is:  \n\n&gt;Now the Ronson myth does however have a bit of truth to it. Early Shermans had very vulnerable ammo racks which were stored in the \"humps\" near the front of the hull. The placement of these ammo racks made it easy for German gunners to know where to hit for catastrophic kills on the Sherman tanks. The army knew of this problem and moved immediately to fix it. The army developed \"wet\" ammo racks which involved putting the ammo racks inside of water filled jackets to douse any embers or fires immediately, and they also moved the ammo racks to the bottom of the tank to reduce the chances of them being hit by AT weapons. Wet stowage reduced the chances of an ammo rack fire or detonation in Sherman tanks to only 15% compared to 60-80% of dry stowage Shermans. The conclusion on the Ronson myth is that while there is truth behind it, the myth has been so overblown as to rival the invulnerability myth of the Tiger.   \n\nOh, and speaking of the \"invulnerability of the Tiger\"....\n\n&gt;All it took was a German adversary like the awe-inspiring Tiger tank with its 88-millimeter gun.\n\nFrom [wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I)   \n\n&gt;While the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time, it was over-engineered, using expensive materials and labour-intensive production methods. The Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and breakdowns, and was limited in range by its high fuel consumption. [...] It was also difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilization when mud, ice and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk-pattern road wheels, often jamming them solid. This was a problem on the Eastern Front in the muddy rasputitsa season and during extreme periods of cold.   \n\nNot sure if you want to call a tank with so many reliability and maneuverability issues \"awe-inspiring.\"  \n\n&gt;The loss of both men and machines is hard to grasp. Simply put, in the heat of battle it was as dangerous inside of a Sherman tank as it was outside of one.\n\nHold on a minute.  \n\n*Thoushaltbemocked pummels his face with a sledgehammer.*   \n\nJust....how the fuck can you be this fucking stupid? There's a fucking reason that 49,234 M4 Shermans (plus 4542 M4A3E8 variants) were built; the Shermans were **good** at what they did. The allies wouldn't have used so many if \"it was as dangerous inside of a Sherman tank as it was outside of one.\"  \n\n(Edit: As [this video](https://youtu.be/bNjp_4jY8pY?t=37m23s) explains, the % casualty rate among armored vehicle crews in the US army was 3%. (1,407 KIA+167 DOW out of a total of 49,516 troops) This was significantly lower than the % casualty rate of infantry, which was 18.5%. (120,111 KIA+19,799 DOW out of a total of 757,712 troops) Statistically, you were less likely to die in an armored vehicle in the US army during WW2 than you were to die in an infantry position. Thanks to /u/GrassWaterDirtHorse for linking this video in the comments section.)\n\n&gt;“The 3rd Armored Division entered combat in Normandy with 232 M-4 Sherman tanks,” writes Belton Cooper, author of the appropriately named Death Traps, a study of U.S. armored divisions and their battles in Europe during World War II.\n\n&gt;“During the European Campaign, the Division had some 648 Sherman tanks completely destroyed in combat and had another 700 knocked out, repaired and put back into operation. This was a loss rate of 580 percent.”   \n\n~~(Edit: As /u/Enleat and /u/NotExistor have pointed out in [this thread,](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4wcb8t/in_which_crackedcom_cites_a_source_that/d65v96i) not only is the \"loss rate of 580%\" absurdly terrible math, but the number of Sherman tanks used for the \"European Campaign\" was pretty huge, in the tens of thousands. If we put that factor in the denominator and put the 648 destroyed+700 knocked out factor in the numerator, the actual loss rate is far less than the stupid claim of \"580%\")~~    \nAs /u/blefuscuer [pointed out,](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4wcb8t/in_which_crackedcom_cites_a_source_that/d664o2p) there's a bit more to the whole thing.   \n\nOh god, and just when I thought it couldn't get worse, the source cites Belton Cooper, a man whose [work was full of flaws.](https://tankandafvnews.com/2015/01/29/debunking-deathtraps-part-1/) Here's just a few:   \n\n&gt;Instead, the reader is subjected to Mr. Cooper veering off into stories he had heard second hand or into broader topics only loosely related to his experiences.  For example, the reader is forced to endure Mr. Coopers opinion on everything from German V2 rockets and jet fighters to General George Patton’s (supposed) influence on US tank design.\n\n&gt;Another aspect of the book that becomes rather frustrating is the authors frequent and persistent hyperbole.  Everything is overstated.  For example, when the author witnesses an aerial battle between US bombers and German fighters, it is described as “the most spectacular aerial battle of the war.”  His admiration for the German opponent seems to know no limits, referring to the German General staff as “brilliant” \n\n#\n&gt;As to the M4 Sherman tank, his penchant for hyperbole extends fully into the opposite direction.  The M4 Sherman is not just inferior to German tanks, it is “tragically” and “vastly”  inferior.  According to the author, the decision to concentrate production on the M4 was “one of the most disastrous decisions of World War II, and its effect on the upcoming battle for Western Europe was catastrophic.”(page 28)  Later, he adds to this sentiment, stating that if US forces had been equipped with a better tank during the November 1944 offensive, “The battle of the Bulge may have never taken place, some 182,000 German and American casualties might have been averted, and the war could have ended five months earlier.” (page 155)\n\n&gt;In regards to the main thesis of this book, that the M4 Sherman was a “death trap”, the author relies on a fairly narrow sets of figures and anecdotes, which he repeats multiple times throughout the book.  Unfortunately, his writings display a surprising level of ignorance about the weapon systems of which he speaks.  Names and designations are repeatedly misidentified, and basic information regarding the performance of various weapon systems are presented incorrectly.  Granted, in most soldier memoirs, errors on technical matters are bound to crop up.  This is expected and forgivable.  However, Death Traps is not just a soldiers memoir.  It is an intentional indictment by an ordnance officer concerning the primary piece of equipment he was charged with being responsible for.  Therefore, one would expect more care to be taken to ensure that the facts presented regarding the subject of the book would in fact be correct.",

The [source](http://billmoyers.com/content/third-party-candidates-from-lincoln-to-nader/), \"Third-Party Candidates from Lincoln to Nader\", says pretty much exactly the same thing:\n\n&gt;Abraham Lincoln — who ran as a Republican during the era of Whigs and Democrats — was America’s last third-party candidate to successfully win the presidency.\n\nHowever, by 1860 the Republican Party was not a third party, it had completely replaced the Whigs in opposition to the Democratic Party. A brief history of the Republicans and Whigs: The GOP was formed in 1854 by ex-Whigs and antislavery activists. The majority of Northern Whigs joined them, so much so that in the 1856 presidential election the Whig Party did not field a candidate of their own. The Republican nominee, John Fremont, came in second, and the last Whigs in Congress changed parties. This means that **in 1860, when Lincoln was elected, the Whig Party was no longer even a thing.**\n\nI know a lot of people on Reddit are sick of the two-party system, but Lincoln is not the example they're looking for. By the time of Lincoln's election--hell, by the time of Fremont's candidacy--the era of \"Whigs and Democrats\" was dead, and the Republicans had established themselves as the new members of the two-party system.",

I’m not going to go too in-depth because I don’t want to get trapped in the rabbit hole that is Margaret Murray’s academic career and the influence it had. \n\nThe main premise of the documentary is that there was a pagan witch-cult that managed to survive the Christianization of western Europe, and during the early modern period the Catholic church used the witch craze as a way of destroying this pagan religion by labelling all of its followers witches and having them burned at the stake. Basically, this documentary was doomed from the start. \n\nThe witch-cult hypothesis was originally put forth by famous Egyptologist and folklorist Margaret Murray. According to her hypothesis, the women and men accused of being witches during the witch trials were actually members of a prehistoric fertility cult that likely worshipped a male deity (the Horned God) and a female deity (the mother Goddess). [This religion may have also been practiced by a race of prehistoric pagan dwarfs as well, according to this book review.](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/213638)  This pagan religion managed to survive the Christianization of western Europe, and continue to be practiced among peasants, particularly among women who were midwives, wise women, and healers. According to Murray, the witch trials in the early modern period were the Church’s attempt to destroy this witch-cult.  \n\nThe problems with this hypothesis are pretty obvious. There’s no evidence at all that this prehistoric fertility cult existed, nor that it continued to through ancient history, through medieval history, and into the early modern period. There’s no evidence that the people killed during the with craze were members of this religion, nor is there any that support that the reason for the witch trials was to get rid of this cult. Most of the sources Murray used to support her hypothesis were things like fairytales, folklore, demonologies, and records from the trials themselves. While these sources are fine when examined with a critical eye, Murray appears to have lacked that critical eye, and instead took what she researched at face value. One of her the contemporary historians, George L. Burr, accused her of taking the confessions of the accused witches as their honest experiences with witchcraft, instead of confessions made under duress, as well as selectively choosing evidence that supported her hypothesis and ignoring that which did not. Really, her work was very poorly received by actual historians at the time who studied the period she was writing about. If you want to want to know more the accusations, check out the wikipedia page for witch-cult hypothesis. \n\n\nDespite how ridiculous and this hypothesis is, and how poorly received it was by the historians of the day, it became highly influential because she was invited to write the 1929 entry for “Witchcraft” for the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1929, presenting her hypothesis as fact in the entry. This wasn’t corrected until 1968. \n\n\nNow that I’ve got the premise out of the way, let’s move on the nitpicking the documentary itself. First of all, this documentary is freely available on youtube, so you can watch it and follow along if you want to : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YizdSL2_pMo\n\n\nBefore we begin, I want to apologize, because this will only address the first half of the documentary. I can’t get the second half of this documentary to load on my computer tonight. I’ll make a second post going over the second half the documentary later. Sorry guys! \n\n\n**1:50** Admittedly I’m no expert on the religion of ancient Rome, but I don’t think they had the same idea of an Earth Goddess who was alive in all things. They had Terra Mater, who was Mother Earth, but she was just one of several agricultural deities as far as I know, and was the personification of the earth. She wasn’t really someone who was “alive in all things.” If I’m wrong, please tell me ebcause I’m genuinely interested in learning more about this topic. \n\n\n\n**6:45** As far as I know the conical hat has never been a symbol knowledge in western Europe. I know conical hats were popular among noble women for a period of time, and there was  distinctive jewish hat that was conical, but in Western European history I don’t a woman wearing a conical hat has ever been a symbol of knowledge or wisdom. \n\n\n\n**12:35** That cross is actually found in Trier, Germany, and it was erected in 958, I think, not 1132.\n\n\n\n**12:41** “[The Cross] was a sign of the times. The symbol of a new religious cult that was sweeping across pagan Europe.” This is just flat out wrong, By 1132 Western Europe was quite firmly Christian. Yes, there were nonChristians living in it, but by far and large, most of the people were Christian, as were more of the rulers.\n\n\n**16:29** I’m not quite sure where they get the idea that Morris dancing was something ever done as a pagan ritual, or why they think it was done originally by women. What scholarship I could find on this actually attribute Morris dancing to be related to Italian/Spanish Moresca dancing. It also seems to have started off as entertainment for the elites, and then eventually spread to the peasantry. However, some argue this isn’t true, and we just don’t have the sources to prove that it was a folk dance, since Medieval english folk dances beloved by the peasants weren’t exactly well recorded. On a similar note, Morris dancers were never persecuted for witchcraft. It remained pretty popular from the 16th century on, other than a brief time during the rule of the Puritan government and  Oliver Cromwell. \n\n\n**18:25** I’m not sure where they are getting the idea that St. Foy was originally a celtic goddess that was Christianized. I can’t find any source on that at all, though one of my friends offered to see if there were any French sources on the subject for me. I’m thinking they possibly mixed up St. Foy and St. Brigid, which would make more sense because Brigid shares a name with an important Celtic deity, and it has been suggested for a long time that the Church simply christianized the celtic goddess and made her a saint. \n\n\n**18:50** I take issue with their claim that many people in medieval Europe saw Mary as a goddess here. It's poor methodology to take a statement from one woman's journal and suggest that it was a reflection of some widely held belief among the rest of the people during that time, particularly when the clergy criticized the woman for saying such a thing. \n\n\n**20:20** Joan of Arc was NOT a pagan witch. In her letters to the King of France she plainly states that she is a Christian. There are also several sources that describe her christian behavior, such as praying, attending mass, etc. Nothing about her behavior or life suggests she was anything but a Christian. \n\n**24:49** What places made these laws saying any woman who practiced any kind of medicine without receiving formal education was to be labelled a witch, and executed? I know they couldn’t have been universal, because I’ve read court cases in Paris where women were brought before the court for practicing medicine without receiving formal education, and most of the time the punishment was a fine, not death. In one of my favorite cases the women straight up tells the court that those laws requiring education don’t apply to her, because she’s not an idiot and she knows what she’s doing. [Here's a link the case if anyone wants to read more about it.](https://books.google.com/books?id=RXndAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Jacoba+university+of+paris+records,+case+of+a+woman+physician&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o4eqY0US8P&amp;sig=B-rakknqoR2u8VlXwD74NkKDK2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuj628_qHOAhXEQiYKHb6bCLEQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacoba%20university%20of%20paris%20records%2C%20case%20of%20a%20woman%20physician&amp;f=false)\n\n\n**25:10** [According to some historians](http://shm.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/1/1.abstract), midwives weren’t specifically targeted by the witch hunts, and they weren’t accused more often than any other occupation. [Here is a full journal article about it](http://courses.washington.edu/hsteu305/Harley,%20Midwives.pdf) if you want to look at it. I thought it was pretty interesting.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI forgot to add a couple of nitpicks. I don't have the exact times for them but:\n\n1. ~~At some point in the film, the witch trials are described as being a \"women's holocaust. This claim is ridiculous. No one was trying to intentionally kill all the women. There was no overall scheme to get rid of all the women in Europe, or anything even remotely similar to the holocaust. It was a horrible time, but it wasn't a holocaust.~~ This one is less of a factual error, and more of an opinion. I personally don't consider it to be at the level of a holocaust, but that doesn't make the statement factually incorrect. Thanks for pointing this out /u/tdogg8\n\n2. One of the talking heads says that 9 million women were killed the witch trials. This isn't true. This number is based off of the faulty calculations of  Gottfried Christian Voigt in 1784. Most scholars place the number of people killed between 40,000 and 60,000. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4vpspd/barbarians_rising_episode_ii_part_1_spartacolypse/",
        "text": "[A while back](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4ntquq/barbarians_rising_la_resistance_against_the/) I watched the first episode of History Channel's new series, *Barbarians Rising*, focusing on the “enemies of Rome”. I found it to be a blast entertainment value wise but pretty uneven historically—and I don't mean that sarcastically, the history started out good and then went way down the wrong path. Curiosity over whether it corrected itself or continued running off the tracks got the better of me, so I decided to watch the second episode, focusing on Spartacus and Arminius.\n\nA quick caveat: the series is based around the central premise that, to quote the recap narrator, the ancient world was divided into two: Rome and the barbarians. This is, obviously, absurd, and so I won't waste time dealing with it or its derivative claims. Anyway, onward to Spartacus!\n\nThe show spends a bit of time at the beginning talking about gladiators so, let's talk about gladiators. Portrayal of gladiatorial combat ranges all over the place in pop culture and a scholarship, from the Hollywood epic and really good movie Gladiator, to the description that is so clinical it becomes oddly apologetic. Criticism of gladiatorial combat goes as far back as the games themselves, with both Cicero and Seneca delivering scathing rebukes, as well as later authors such as Tertullian and, most magnificently, St. Augustine. And yet, at the same time, when we think about ancient Rome gladiators are one of the first things that come to mind, and one of the foremost parts of cultural depiction of the same, indicating that our minds may not be quite out of the gutter yet. But what Hollywood depictions, and this docu-drama episode, get wrong is how they portray the form of gladiatorial combat. Gladiators fought with real live weapons, but the manner in which they fought was highly proscribed, with rules and very specific ways the fight was supposed to proceed. As a result of this, the rate was something like 1 in 10 matches seeing death, which to be clear is really goddamn high but wasn't the norm: the point was the combat, not the blood. If you want to take the argument really far and why not, one could connect it to Homeric combat in which the duels of heroes almost always end with one or the other suing for mercy. The show, naturally, decides to ct all that mumbo jumbo and just shows people killing each other.\n\nAnyway, the first ten minutes of the show follows the usual story every Spartacus retelling does: Spartacus is a gladiator, he and his stablemates rebel from the gladiator school, he heads to Vesuvius, and acquires a woman along the way. Unfortunately there just isn't that much information on the guy beyond the simple narrative, which does not mean the show doesn't manage to get one major thing wrong: rather hilariously they have a US Marshal as a talking head, who says that law enforcement were following Spartacus closely. Rome, of course, did not have police, or sheriffs, or SPQR Marshals. There was a provincial consular position dealing with the roads and woods of Italy, but the mechanics of how they were patrolled is uncertain. Probably, with posses. Anyway.\n\nBased on his accent, Spartacus is from northern Thrace.\n\nAround twenty minutes in, the show does the whole “discourse on leadership” thing it apparently likes doing, which, fine, but the talking head said that Mandela didn't expect to become the head of a revolutionary movement. Now while I don't mean to psychoanalyze the past, Mandela was born into a Xhosa royal family, was a head of the ANC Youth League before he was thirty and made a regional head of the ANC when he was 35. C'mon.\n\nAlso at twenty minutes in, the narrator says that Spartacus' rebellion means that “Rome's plan to bring the barbarians within its borders is starting to backfire”, and leaving aside anything else this was neither the first, nor the second, nor the largest major slave revolts. One and two were on Sicily, the breadbasket of the Rome.\n\nAt minute thirty five, enter Crassus. Not much to say here except that the show is positioning his official position is a very strange way, saying that few men had ever been given his power before. In reality, Crassus was made Praetor, a perfectly respectable Republican office, and he behaved in a pretty ordinarily constitutional way.\n\nThe segment ends with the slaves being crucified, in which they are nailed to the cross through their wrists rather than the more famous yet anatomically improbable hands. So well done.\n\nAnd that is enough for me for now, I may watch the Arminius section later, but this one was pretty boring. The Spartacus story is one that has been told and retold endlessly, and this telling was, I suppose, alright in terms of accuracy. The basic problems still remain, the gladiatorial fights were way off, but the general narrative is correct and the interpretative interpolations are plausible. And, in case you were curious, the talking heads are still hilariously inappropriate to the topic, being comprised primarily of a generic roster of American military men and the like.\n\nIf you are actually curious about Spartacus in history, simply read the [Plutarch](http://www.livius.org/so-st/spartacus/spartacus_t01.html), which amounts to a couple pages.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4vj5s2/badhistory_in_the_warriors_documentary_series_by/",
        "text": "Hello, fellow BadHistorians. Today, I shall discuss one of the documentaries in the History Channel series \"Warriors\", which can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV85w4jnfsY) It basically discusses medieval knights and the Battle of Agincourt. Keep in mind that, I'm no expert in this field, so I might make mistakes. If you find any, or if you have any other comments in general, do let me know.   \n\n05:53—The lance being the deadliest weapon of the middle ages? Honestly, I’m sure you can’t say that for any single weapon, especially not the lance, due to its dependence on cavalry(which can be thwarted using, say, pikemen).  \n\n08:00—From here begins a pretty long monologue on the significance of chivalry and how noble it is and how it included protecting the weak. In reality, as I’m sure many of you know, chivalry wasn't that rosy an ideal. Knights [had their share of violent, war-mongering shitbags.]( https://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V62N3/feature2.html) Ultimately, even the better versions of the chivalric code were merely on paper, with many knights not choosing to follow them at all or choosing to follow the code only when it was helpful to them. According to [this article:](http://origins.osu.edu/review/knighthood-it-was-not-we-wish-it-were)  \n&gt; Knights were expected to be fully active Christians and were limited by its prohibitions just like any other gentile. However, they could also be guilty of terrible atrocities, generating a tension that was often acknowledged but never really solved. Usually concessions were made by Christian figures in specific situations (as Saul discusses in Chapter 12, killing enemies while on crusade was acceptable because they were heretics and thus outside the Christian hierarchy) while knights stayed their hand against enemy knights whenever advantageous. This dispensation, however, did not extend to the peasantry who were often slaughtered unremittingly whenever they were deemed in the way.   \n\nEdit: As /u/TheSteelShepherd has [pointed out,](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4vj5s2/badhistory_in_the_warriors_documentary_series_by/d600vsn) you had virtuous knights and you had the terrible ones. Sorry for not taking a more nuanced viewpoint earlier.\n\n~~13:37—Ah well, a weapon which *all* young warriors had to master? As our friends at AskHistorians have already [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1u4j68/were_swords_as_common_in_medieval_times_as_books/) swords were incredibly expensive and hard-to-obtain weapons of their time. The poorer foot-soldiers would have used simpler and cheaper weapons.~~   \n\n(Edit: As /u/nanashi_shino pointed out, fencing was a popular sport in the Late Medieval period amongst young adults, and older, rustier swords were available for [as little as two pence,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1fcRG0A3g&amp;feature=youtu.be) according to scholagladiatoria. ~~But I haven't heard of any accounts stating that it was ever compulsory for \"young warriors\" to learn how to use swords in military capacity.~~)   \n\n(Edit 2: Scratch the last part as well, /u/EquinoxActual has repudiated it well [in their comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4vj5s2/badhistory_in_the_warriors_documentary_series_by/d5ze8bo?context=3))\n\n14:41—A sword cutting a man from shoulder to hip? Let’s take a break from anime-style fantasy and remember that the human body is way too dense and way too full of bone to allow that sort of stuff. The mythbusters tried to cut a block of [ballistics gel with a samurai sword](http://youtu.be/6Z8i6V2wYHU?t=9m27s), and it only got through 9 inches before stopping. Now imagine the resistance which bone would put up, and you’d realize that the feat they’re talking about is impossible, regardless of what sword you consider.    \n\n14:50—Okay, so now a sword goes through a helmet *and* a skull, only to be stopped by the teeth? While one could give them the benefit of doubt and assume that they’re talking about a weak helmet, such as one made of leather (even then, it sounds very difficult to pull off), the implication they’re making involves a steel helmet, which is pretty much impossible to cut through with a sword strike, as [Mike Loades can attest to.](https://youtu.be/n6Zzm0UbUm4?t=31m4s)  \n\n15:47—Commoners and peasants wouldn’t be able to afford or gain access to the sword? What about it being the weapon that *all* warriors had to master? ~~C’mon guys, at least be consistent in your bad history.~~  \n\n(Edit: As has been brought to my attention by /u/nanashi_shino, older swords were way cheaper than we assume in the late medieval period, costing as little as 2 pence each)  \n\n16:42—There were [many different forms of dubbing,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accolade#Ceremony) and they did not necessarily use a sword.   \n\n17:40—The shaft of the arrow which was shot into Henry V’s face was [removed with the help of other people](http://www.medievalists.net/2013/05/20/prince-hals-head-wound-cause-and-effect/), and it required a lot of painstaking effort to remove the arrowhead, which was embedded 6 inches deep in his skull. So yeah, he didn’t exactly pull the arrow out by himself.  \n\n22:06—I doubt that an English longbow would ever have a draw-weight higher than [185 lbs at most.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_longbow#Draw_weights)  \n\n22:07—The range of medieval English longbows [isn’t exactly known,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_longbow#Range) and a 400 yard flight has not been achieved in modern shootings of the English longbow, rendering the 200-400 yard figure somewhat doubtful. A bit of a nitpick, but I thought it was necessary to point out.   \n\n22:52—For one, I find the 180 mph figure unlikely, because I haven’t read of speeds that high anywhere. Again, if you can correct me on this, you’re welcome. In any case, release speeds would vary depending upon the draw-weight of the arrow, something which they haven’t specified for the 180 mph figure. The same can be said for the figures given for the range and impact speed of the longbow; you must specify the relevant draw-weight, otherwise they mean little.  \n\n30:17—~~There’s no horse that weighs [as much as two tons.](https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=_V2eV9vAO4LT8geC5brICg&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=weight+of+a+horse)~~   \n\n(Edit: Okay, I'm sorry for adding a Google search results page as the source. In any case though, the largest horse ever weighed in history [weighed 1524 kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse#Size_and_measurement), leading me to believe that yeah, two ton horses were still non-existant) \n\n31:46—Wounding a full armored knight at 250 yards and killing at 100 yards? If the knight were indeed fully armored, and, as the documentary implies, the kills were achieved by penetrating the armor, I find that [highly unlikely,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodkin_point#Armour_penetration) even at point-blank range, especially because fully armored knights also wore a gambeson or a padded jack underneath their armor.  \n\n32:59—A knight lost 70-80% of his combat effectiveness when unhorsed? Where in the name of ever-loving fuckery did you get those statistics from? And why would [knights even engage in combat on foot in such a case?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1eca6m/did_medieval_knights_ever_fight_on_foot/c9yynux) I will directly quote the linked AskHistorians comment here:   \n&gt; By the time of Agincourt it had become standard practice for knights to \"dismount for battle and stand with the archers, \"and always a great number of gentlemen did so in order that the common soldiers might be reassured and fight better.'\"[…]   \n&gt; At Agincourt the vast majority of the French and English knights fought on foot.  \n  \n39:11—The French weren’t within a distance of 150 yards from the archers when they let loose their arrows. As a matter of fact, the archers [shot earlier, when the men-at-arms were 300 yards away:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt#Main_French_assault)   \n&gt; The plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 300 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as \"a terrifying hail of arrow shot.\"   \n\nEdit: Do let me know if I've gotten anything wrong, or if there's any additional badhistory that I've missed. Also, I fixed one of the youtube links...the previous one wasn't working anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi all. If you don't know who Ann Garrison is, then that's probably a good thing, but if you want to know then check out [my post a few months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/498bjm/rwanda_deniers_circlejerk_each_other/). Anyway, [she's back again with more nonsense on the Rwandan Genocide.](http://www.globalresearch.ca/rwanda-the-clinton-dynasty-and-the-case-of-dr-leopold-munyakazi/5538635) Intriguingly enough, this time she doesn't even really bother to deny, just to justify it.\n\nTo start with though, it's probably worth me saying that this guy she's talking about, Dr. Léopold Munyakazi, wrong (factually and morally) as his statements about the events of 1994 might be, does plausibly sound like an innocent man. I'm not going to say that with certainty, but a sudden accusation of involvement in the genocide, 22 years after the actual events, just when he becomes unlikeable to the Kagame regime, sounds a lot like the very real abuse of such accusations by the Rwandan courts and government.\n\nI should expand a bit here. The UN tribunal for Rwanda, ICTR, was, despite the claims of the apologists, broadly a reliable, thorough and professional court. However, it only really managed and tried the ~100 big players in the genocide. The thousands of other more minor players like Interahamwe footsoldiers, low-level civil servants and MRND party officials, etc, were left to the Rwandan local courts. There is no doubt whatsoever that these courts have been horrifically prone to corruption and abuse. Sure, they've been used for political reasons, but just as common if not more so has been their use for personal vendettas and material gain. For a few quite shocking examples of this, I'd recommend checking out the first few pages of Gerard Prunier's [*Africa's World War*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kp93kUfdhC0C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), which I've linked. Whether Munyakazi's claim that this accusation is fabricated is true or not, I can't know for sure, but it's certainly believable.\n\nNow that's been said, time to take Garrison to pieces:\n\n&gt; A Rwandan exile speaks out against Rwandan totalitarianism, disagrees with Rwanda’s constitutionally codified description of the 1994 massacres as “genocide against the Tutsi,”\n\nWell, it's not just the Rwandan government that defines it as a genocide, is it? It's also a UN-established tribunal, and the vast majority of scholars on Rwanda and genocide.\n\n&gt; Yet another challenge to the Wikipedia/Hotel Rwanda story has come from Professors Allan Stam and Christian Davenport, after 10 years of research in Rwanda. In the 2015 BBC documentary Rwanda’s Untold Story, Allan Stam had this exchange with the BBC’s Jane Corbin:\n&gt; Allan Stam: If a million people died in Rwanda in 1994 — and that’s certainly possible — there is no way that the majority of them could be Tutsi.\n&gt; Jane Corbin: How do you know that?\n&gt; Allan Stam: Because there weren’t enough Tutsi in the country.\n&gt; Jane Corbin: The academics calculated there had been 500,000 Tutsis before the conflict in Rwanda; 300,000 survived. This led them to their final controversial conclusion.\n&gt; Allan Stam: If a million Rwandans died, and 200,000 of them were Tutsi, that means 800,000 of them were Hutu.\n&gt; Jane Corbin: That’s completely the opposite of what the world believes happened in the Rwandan genocide.\n&gt; Allan Stam: What the world believes, and what actually happened, are quite different.\n\nDavenport and Stam are a bizarre pair. They don't deny the genocide as such, just have very odd views on it, such as the claim that the Interahamwe were massacring hundreds of thousands of both Hutus and Tutsis indiscriminately for no obvious reasons. That said, the numbers given here appear to be complete nonsense. There were far more than 500,000 Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. Even the heavily flawed 1991 census recorded nearly 600,000 Tutsis. However, it is widely accepted, including by the census report itself, that Tutsis were systematically undercounted for a variety of reasons. Prunier, for example, estimated that the real figure was probably slightly over 900,000.\n\nAnd no, 300,000 didn't survive. I covered this in my previous post, but deniers and apologists seem to pick this number from a survivors group with no critical evaluation other than that it suits their ends. It's probably a feasible upper bound, but many other studies, such as Prunier, and Alison Des Forges for HRW, estimated the number of survivors at far lower, well under 200,000. And a death toll of 1 million is also an upper bound; most estimate the death toll at between 500,000 and 1,000,000. While the Rwandan government claims figures around the latter, the most commonly accepted number is around 800,000.\n\n&gt; Dr. Munyakazi stated what seemed obvious to many who have studied  the history of Rwanda and Burundi.  He said that Hutu and Tutsi speak the same language, share the same culture, eat the same food, and even marry each other, with membership in one group or the other determined patrilineally. Ninety-three percent of Rwandans are Christian. They are distinguished instead, by historical class privilege.  Prior to colonization, the Tutsi were a cattle owning, feudal ruling class, the Hutu a subservient peasant class.  Belgian colonists reified this divide by issuing ID cards that labeled Rwandans and Burundians as Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa.\n\nThis is a mangled version of the truth. Yes, Tutsi and Hutu were initially social classes. At that point, like all social classes, that status did not transmit patrilineally, but depended on your wealth and prestige. And yes, it's likely true that fully being accepted into the upper class didn't fully happen over the course of just one generation, and those who became wealthy over the course of their lifetime may well have been seen as *parvenu* upstarts. But in general, it was a vague, relatively fluid class system.\n\nThat changed when the Belgians took charge after WW1. Hutu and Tutsi became fixed hereditary statuses, governed by the Belgians as (and thus becoming) ethnic groups rather than social classes. At first, the Belgian government maintained and supported the Tutsi elite. Nevertheless, there did develop a class of wealthy Hutus. However, in 1959, a couple of years before Rwanda was granted independence, Hutu leaders seized power and drove many Tutsis out of the country into Uganda. For the next 35 years, Hutus (or their political elites, at least) would be the dominant ethnic group, with Tutisis marginalised.\n\nIn short, by 1994, Hutu and Tutsi have not been traditional social classes for nearly 80 years, and the case of \n&gt; historically privileged Tutsi and the historically oppressed Hutu.\n\nhas not been the case for 35 years.\n\n&gt; There is nothing like the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide to prevent and punish class war.  Article II of the Convention says that “genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”  It says nothing about preventing or punishing the murder of masses of people in order to claim, reclaim or defend wealth and privilege. Nor does it say anything about the murder of masses of people in order to steal what they have, such as oil, land, water or mineral riches.\n\nIt also doesn't say anywhere \"if there are any motives of personal enrichment involved, then that's totally fine and OK and discounts everything else in this document\". Garrison here is playing on a common theme in genocide apologia - playing on popular misconceptions about genocide and what it actually means, in particular implying what I'd call a purist or hard-intentionalist view of genocide; that it only counts as genocide if the killings are motivated purely by the perpetrators' ethnic/racial hatred of the victims. This is quite emphatically untrue; virtually every major text on genocide will point out the significant roles of personal vendetta and material gain as motives for perpetrators. In fact, I'm sure you're well aware of another case where genocide was committed against people in order to steal land and natural resources from them - as the product of that process is a country called the United States.\n\nAlso, the Interahamwe didn't simply kill Tutsis because they were rich. They continued to hunt and kill Tutsis who'd run from and abandoned their homes and property. On the other hand, they didn't go after wealthy Hutu businessmen, many of whom were involved in the Interahamwe - if you've seen *Hotel Rwanda*, then you know the example of George Rutaganda, a wealthy Hutu businessman who was Interahamwe vice-president.\n\n&gt; Trouble is President Bill Clinton did not “fail to intervene” in Rwanda.  He refused to intervene and stopped the UN Security Council from organizing an intervention, because the U.S. and UK had already intervened in support of General Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Army that invaded Rwanda from Uganda in October 1990.\n\nReally? Where were all the British and American forces then? As I've said before, this is what most people generally consider to be \"intervention\" - not Washington voting a particular way on the Security Council or providing some encouraging language to a particular side.\n\n&gt; The evidence of this is laid out in Robin Philpot’s Rwanda and the New Scramble for Africa, Ed Herman and David Peterson’sEnduring Lies: Rwanda in the Propaganda System 20 Years Later, Peter Erlinder’s Accidental Genocide, Carla Del Ponte’s Madame Prosecutor: Confrontations with Humanity’s Worst Criminals and the Culture of Impunity and Jean-Marie Ndajigimana’s How Paul Kagame Deliberately Sacrificed the Tutsi.\n\nWith the exception of Del Ponte, these are all Garrison's fellow traveller apologists. To paraphrase Gerard Caplan, it's like a Holocaust denier telling you to read Zundel, Irving and Faurisson, or a Creationist referring you to AnswersinGenesis and Creation Ministries International, to support their argument.",

It's more or less good, talking about the history and near-misses in that field, until we get to the *very last line*:\n\n&gt;Finally, of course, there's the whole matter of why almost no progress was made in Europe between roughly 400 CE and roughly 1600 CE, around any of the tremendous mathematical and scientific achievements of the Greeks. This is, obviously, a complex question, but an important part of the answer has to do with the rise of Christianity. Few things stifle curiosity and progress more effectively than religious dogmatism.\n\nUgh. That hurt. It's not even your *normal* brand anti-historical Christiophobia, it's something *better*: somehow, the *Church*, not the Germanic invasions, not the societal collapse, not the civil wars, not the plagues, were what stifled 'scientific advancement' in Europe from 400 to 800 AD. And I'm pretty sure that even the claim that nothing was happening was wrong: if anyone has info there, do comment.  \nAnd when you look a bit deeper, there's only *more*. I looked in the comments, hoping to see at least *someone* giving this guy a history lesson, and I wasn't altogether dissapointed: someone did point out that the claim that 'dogmatism' was the root of all scientific evil was a little unfounded, given the large bounds achieved by scientists in the middle of the counter-reformation. His response?\n\n&gt;I'm happy to change the date range to 400–1300, but the claim that the stall is imaginary strikes me as misinformed. Comparing the dramatic scientific progress made since Fermat and Newton to the prior centuries, there's no way to miss the difference. Knowledge was, at best, preserved, but to claim that the church encouraged scientific questioning the way Catherine the Great did in Russia, for example, is ludicrous. Galileo had to fight the religious leaders of his time, rather than being sponsored by them.\n\nGlad to know I'm misinformed and that the Byzantine Empire did nothing to advance history. They just didn't *encourage scientific questioning* like the Russians. And then... Galileo. Jig's up boys, he caught us with our... religious dogmatism, I guess.\n\nGod, I hate Quora sometimes.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4vbepb/bad_varangian_history_part_one_or_how/",
        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! I would have done this review much sooner, but I was struck down by a cold for the past week and have spent much of my time sleeping. I am almost recovered, however, which means it is time for another documentary. The subject today is Ancient Black Ops, Episode 6: The Varangian Guard. I would also like to provide a shout-out to the ever elegant u/Claidheamh_Righ for suggesting this series, although I don't know if his motivation was either trust in my ability to point out the errors, or sadism. Since the Varangians came from Russia/Scandinavia, my imaginary glass shall be filled with Brännvin. So lets begin!\n\n0.09: The first references to the Dark Ages. Drink!\n\n0.19: The narrator states that the Varangian Guard were an elite special forces. Ignoring the redundancy of the phrase \"elite special forces\", this comparison is incredibly flawed. Special forces are incredibly small units intended for operations such as sabotage, assassinations and counter-insurgency/terrorism. The Varangian Guard were a professional unit made up of several thousand warriors that fought in pitched battles such as Dyrrhachium and Beroia. They were the equivalent of Marines who could actually shut up about being in the Marines. DRINK!\n\n0.26: The narrator states the Varangians conquered unruly territories across the Byzantine Empire. I almost don't know where to begin with this. If the territories were across the Byzantine Empire, they didn't really need to be conquered. Additionally, the Varangians were always part of a larger army which practised a combined-arms doctrine. There was never a single instance where the Varangians alone conquered a territory. They were only decisive in the Byzantine Civil War of 989 AD where they helped the Emperor Basil \"The Amateur Optometrist\" II defeat Bardas Phocas. DRINK!\n\n0.37: The narrator explains that Harald Hardrada helped secure the Varangian's place in history. No, I'm pretty sure being an elite guard unit of one of the longest reigning empires that ever existed did that. DRINK!\n\n0.40: The academic called the prototypical Viking of the era. Considering that Harold lived in the 11th century AD, and Vikings had been active more than 200 years earlier, I think their definition of \"prototypical\" might be a bit inaccurate. DRINK!\n\n0.45: The narrator just said Harold Hardrada would develop tactics that would transform warfare across the Mediterranean. Excuse me a moment.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*SOUNDS OF OBJECTS BEING BROKEN, MASSES OF PEOPLE SCREAMING AND POLICE SIRENS*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOkay, now I feel better. Anyway, Harold transformed absolutely nothing. He, and the Vikings/Russians/Varangians in general had *zero* to teach the Byzantines. The Byzantines could perform false retreats and encircling and out-flanking manoeuvres, integrated light missile troops and heavy infantry troops into a formation called the foulkon which could provide both ranged support and a solid battle-line to resist infantry and cavalry assaults, had marching formations that could keep an army together whilst being harassed by mounted archers and were incredibly adept at sieges. They had one of the most well developed military forces in the world at this point. This mistakes requires at least four shots. DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! Oh, to hell with it. DRINK!\n\n0.51: The academic stated that storming a city wall was usually doomed to failure. Given the number of successful sieges the Byzantines engaged in, I am not sure \"usually doomed to failure\" is the right word to utilise. Antioch, Laodicea, Candia, Kastamon, Tarsus, Preslav and a host of other cities and forts fell to them. DRINK!\n\n0.58: The narrator states Harold Hardradas string of victories would show the Varangian Guard to be one of the most exceptional special forces of all times. Again, the Varangians were not special forces, and although Harold Hardrada became the commander of the Varangian Guard, it was just one part of a larger army. DRINK!\n\n1.00: I honestly think this has been the most number errors I have ever observed in under one minute. Also, my liver just jumped out of my torso whilst wearing a bowler hat and carrying a pair of suitcases and proceeded to walk out the room.\n\n1.54: The narrator just called the Emperor Basil II the most powerful man in the world. Now, as much as I love the Byzantines, I have to disagree with that. Given the population and income of Song China, one could posit that the Song Emperors or their chancellors had more power (Wang Anshi says 'hi'). Also, the Chalukya dynasty and the other Indian powers could be said to be equal in strength. DRINK!\n\n2.36: I just love how Vladimir the Great walks in like a total pimp and looks at the princess like \"How YOU doin?\"\n\n2.43: Vladimir the Great gives a smile that says \"Heeeeeey, sweet honey-mama!\"\n\n2.46: The academic calls Vladimir the prototypical viking. THAT WORD DOES NOT MEAN WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS! DRINK!\n\n3.04: The academic says Vladimir had 800 concubines, dozens of wives and engaged in human sacrifices. He also states there was nothing redeeming about him. I politely beg to differ. ALL HAIL THE GRAND PRINCE OF SWAGGER!\n\n3.05: Being serious for a moment, according the Russian Primary Chronicle, after marrying Anna:\n\n\"Hereupon Vladimir took the princess and Anastasius and the priests of Kherson, together with the relics of St. Clement and of Phoebus his disciple, and selected also sacred vessels and images for the service. In Kherson he thus founded a church on the mound which had been heaped up in the midst of the city with the earth removed from his embankment; this church is standing at the present day. Vladimir also found and appropriated two bronze statues and four bronze horses, which now stand behind the Church of the Holy Virgin, and which the ignorant think are made of marble. As a wedding present for the princess, he gave Kherson over to the Greeks again, and then departed for Kiev.\"\n\nAnd that:\n\n\"Thereafter Vladimir sent heralds throughout the whole city to proclaim that if any inhabitant, rich or poor, did not betake himself to the river, he would risk the prince's displeasure. When the people heard these words, they wept for joy, and exclaimed in their enthusiasm, \"If this were not good, the prince and his boyars would not have accepted it.\" On the morrow the prince went forth to the Dnepr with the priests of the princess and those from Kherson, and a countless multitude assembled. They all went into the water: some stood up to their necks, others to their breasts, the younger near the bank, some of them holding children in their arms, while the adults waded farther out. The priests stood by and offered prayers. There was joy in heaven and upon earth to behold so many souls saved.\"\n\nNow, Vladimir seemed to embrace his new religion wholeheartedly and went to great efforts to spread it amongst the Rus. This missionary activity hardly gels with the idea of a man without redeeming qualities and would certainly meet the medieval conception of a morally just and upright Ruler. Vladimir was an incredibly fascinating character.\n\n3.22: Okay, I have to give the documentary credit here. The Varangians are using equipment which generally match the time period and would have realistically been a part of their arsenal.\n\n3.26. Aaaaaaand now they've spoilt it. The narrator calls the Varangians the finest special forces in late antiquity. THIS WAS NOT LATE ANTIQUITY. Late antiquity covers the time period from the 3rd century to the 8th century AD. The Varangians were active from the very late 10th century AD onwards, or 200+ years after late antiquity. DRINK!\n\n4.12: Vikings or members of a German heavy metal band?\n\n4.16: The academic states the Vikings would stop at nothing to slaughter their opponents. This is completely false. True, the Vikings engaged in behaviour that horrified Christian Europeans, but they were also very pragmatic and would often prefer to accept silver and other valuable goods in exchange for leaving a region. This was much less risky and more profitable than constantly engaging in battle against native forces. DRINK!\n\n5.15: The academic says the Varangian long-axe was more like a meat cleaver. That is true except for size, balance, design, fighting style and EVERYTHING F#CKING ELSE! This is what a long-axe may have looked like: \n\nhttp://www.coldsteel-uk.com/store/viking-axe-89va.jpg\n\nThe blade was quite thin to make the weapon very light and agile. Hardly a \"meat-cleaver\". DRINK!\n\n5.30: The academic calls the long-axe a lethal weapon. As opposed to the non-lethal weapons the Vikings were famous for using.  \n\n6.10: I must reluctantly compliment this documentary for actually discussing how important spears were rather than just focusing on swords as the ultimate tool of destruction. DRINK BECAUSE I AM TOASTING THEM IN PRAISE!\n\n6.27: Realistic demonstration of how two people could actually fight together using a single shield for cover, unlike *certain other shows*. DRINK BECAUSE I AM TOASTING THEM IN PRAISE!\n\n6.42: Accurate explanation as to the purpose of the wings on a spear. DRINK BECAUSE I AM TOASTING THEM IN PRAISE!\n\n7.12: VARANGIANS BEING BROS!\n\n7.40: The narrator calls Basil II the wealthiest man in the world whilst the ignoring the other major states of the time period. DRINK!\n\n8.59: The narrator claims that in the 11th century the magnificence of Constantinople was without equal. I'm sure Kaifeng or Baghdad would be quite comparable. DRINK!\n\n9.56: The academic says that the Byzantine Empire was legendary for its devious plotting. CULTURAL STEREOTYPING! BYZANTIPHOBIA! \n\n12.38: The academic states acid was used by the Byzantines to blind prisoners. I cannot find any references to his being so. DRINK!\n\n13.08: Torture or college hazing?\n\n13.34: I never thought images of strip bars and sleazy music would ever be used in a documentary about medieval warfare before.\n\n14.00: The academic states that Constantinople was in a lush tropical climate. Just....no. It was a mediterranean climate, which could be very hot but also absolutely freezing in the winter. Tropical climates have an average temperature of at least 18 degrees C and are much more humid. BAD WEATHER ZONE DRINK!\n\n15.41: Obviously blunt sword. DRINK!\n\n15.55: The Byzantine officer is much too pale. As an inhabitant of the Mediterranean region, he would be olive-skinned or tanned. DRINK!\n\n16.03: The narrator states the Varangians, unlike other Vikings, had to learn discipline. Whilst the Vikings may not have been disciplined in the sense of using a proper marching technique or maintaining their kit (BOOT, WHY IS THERE DUST ON YOUR SHIELD! HIT THE FLOOR AND PUSH UNTIL THE JARL GETS TIRED!), they had enough expertise to build field fortification, maintain close formations on the battlefield and were rarely caught by surprise, all which is a far cry from the image of 'wild' barbarians. DRINK!\n\n16.05: Obviously blunt sword-point. DRINK!\n\n16.14: Hollywood back-scabbard. DRINK!\n\n16.18: The narrator says the Vikings were used to charging head-first into battle, which is why they were never associated with defensive tactics like the shieldwall. DRINK!\n\n16.24: Another blunt sword-point. DRINK!\n\n16.54: Okay, I love this combat sequence.\n\n17.12: Hollywood dual-wield. DRINK!\n\n17.14: The academic states the Varangians would never give ground. Except they did precisely that. At the Battle of Dyrrhachium they were drawn out from the main battle-line, isolated and routed. DRINK!\n\n18.21: The narrator describes a tactic unique to the Vikings called the Boar-Snout. Of course, by unique they mean \"used by everyone else\". It was a common Roman, Greek and Germanic method of attack which involved assuming a wedge formation. DRINK!\n\n19.02: The effect of this tactic looks less like \"bloody melee\" and more like \"Faster guys, the Sailor Moon Booth is this way!\".\n\nWell, that is it for part one. See you next time!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSources\n\nThe Age of Confucian Rule: The Song Transformation of China, by Dieter Kuhn and Timothy Brook\n\nThe Development of the Komnenian Army 1081-1180, by John W.

        "text": "Just saw this trailer and I had some major issues with it and its description. Please correct me if I'm wrong in my rant\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2-1hz1juBI)\n\nThere seems to be a lot of stretching the truth in this trailer and the movie description.\n\nFrom the trailer description: '...saved 75 men without firing or carrying a gun.  He was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon, as he believed that while the war was justified, killing was nevertheless wrong. As an army medic, he single-handedly evacuated the wounded...'\n\nLet's start with the first two sentences, mainly the parts that say 'without firing or carrying a gun' and 'only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon.' This is a flat out lie, especially since the the very next sentence starts with 'As an army medic.' No American medics in World War II carried a weapon! At that time, medics were considered 'non-combatants' you didn't shoot at them cause they couldn't shoot at you. This was explicitly stated in the first Geneva convention under \"Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field,\" where the red cross was officially adopted as a medical symbol on the battlefield. This symbol was meant to signify to enemy combatants that the medic qualifies as a non-combatant. To try and say that he was the only one who was unarmed is an insult to the men of the Army/Navy Medical Corps that served in WW2. All of them went into battle armed only with bandages, they all should be recognized for that bravery. \n\n'as he believed that while the war was justified, killing was nevertheless wrong.' If you were a conscientious objector in WW2, they made you a medic or sent you to a non-combat job like supply or administration. Do you really think that out of the millions of Americans that were drafted, he was the only one who objected to killing? No! There were a lot of them! It's fine that he had his beliefs, but again, don't try and make it sound like he was the only one. To quote Stephen Ambrose in his book 'Citizen Soldiers' from the chapter dedicated to Army Medics, 'They were called Doc, the medics who attended wounded soldiers in battlefield in World War II. **They were usually volunteer conscientious objectors;'**\n\nAnd on to the trailer where he is shown bravely denying being issued a rifle is again wrong. To quote Stephen Ambrose from the same book, 'The medics underwent the same training as infantrymen except for not using weapons. First ridiculed by other soldiers as “pill pushers,” they became greatly loved and admired in combat.' So the situation in the trailer should not have happened.\n\nI am not trying to degrade this man's achievements and what he did during the war. I am against this hollywood interpretation. He was one of thousands of unarmed medics and one of hundreds of conscientious objectors in WW2. Them trying to make him out to be some 'one-of-a-kind' man is wrong and an insult to those other brave men who did the same thing. Tell his story, by all means, but don't neglect the accomplishments and bravery of others.",

However even if we believe that the discovery^1 of America turned out to be necessary, in some God's eye view sense, it is still the question if someone else could discover America. After all other people discovered America, and several smaller islands like Australia which I would guess are somewhat harder to find. Additionally, even if we assume for a second that stopping the Holocaust was contingent upon the discovery of America, it does not justify enslaving the natives. For that one would need to show that enslaving the natives was somehow necessary to end the Holocaust. \n\nI promised that the entire thread is a disaster, someone answers: \n\n&gt; The only reason D-Day was done was to race the Soviets to Berlin and stop them conquering all of Europe. If you want to take credit for that, go ahead.\n\n&gt; Not to mention the Soviets also liberated Auschwitz, so...\n\nWell, Stalin was surely a huge fan of getting some competition in the race to Berlin,^2 probably an expression of his famous sportsmanship. I am getting to the second part after the answer of the original poster: \n\n&gt;  wait, so that was the only concentration camp? TIL\n\nAuschwitz was not the only concentration camp, there was a whole system of camps. Of these camps, the extermination camps were all liberated by the soviets, since they were to the east of Germany, most of them in Poland. On the other hand, the Nazis \"evacuated\"^3 many camps before the Red Army could get there, with the effect that many survivors of the Holocaust were liberated by western Allies. \n\nIn conclusion, never fight a pig, you will get dirty and the pig likes it.\n \nSources: \n\nA history book, each and every one would improve that.^4\n\n^1 I use discovered here, since I am speaking specifically about the European perspective. (And I do not really like any of the alternative designations for the event.) \n\n[Edit as footnotes:]\n\n^2 [Apparently the state department has a history section](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/tehran-conf), in this context probably not the best source (They would say they were invited, wouldn't they?), but compare \n\nVojtech Mastny, *Soviet War Aims at the Moscow and Teheran Conferences of 1943* (1975)  ([JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1876003)\n\n\n^3 To be clear, \"evacuated\" here is a euphemism for death march, there is a really good discussion on askhistorians which I do not find at the moment.\n\n^4 Funny thing, I actually have a source\n\nJohn Lewis Gaddis, *The Landscape of History*, 2004 \n\nhas a very interesting discussion of counterfactuals and their role in historical reasoning. \n\n\n",

I’m gonna concentrate on three reasons why what he said was silly. \n\nBadhistory 1: Christianity has by no means been confined to ‘the West.’ Christian groups such as the Egyptian Coptic Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, or the St Thomas Christian community in India, are ancient. I mean, Ethiopia adopted Christianity before any ‘Western’ state. I imagine King might respond that these are marginal communities which haven’t really impacted the long-term horizon of ‘civilisation.’ However, I can think of at least one [Bishop of Hippo]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) who would beg to differ.\n\nBadhistory 2: the whole anachronism of using the term Western to describe things like Roman civilisation. I realise that he doesn’t exactly give a time frame for his statement, but he’s arguing that Christianity is the driving force, so I’ll start from just about the beginning. Anyways, applying the label ‘Western’ is an anachronism at the start of the Christian church and for a good time after. \n\nBadhistory 3: what has the non-West ever done for us? I realise that this particular bit of badhistory is kind of beating a dead horse in this sub, but I couldn’t let this one go. Purely off the top of my head, I’ll give a few examples\n\n* The libraries of Timbuktu—millions of books and a city that thrived entirely on the book trade. \n\n* The systems of Chinese exams used to select the civil service (obviously I’m not arguing that this is a perfect meritocracy, but was the ‘West’ any better) \n\n* The astronomic calendars of the Maya\n\n* [This]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalibela) , [This]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat), and [this]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Zimbabwe). \n\nHonestly I could go on, but I know I’m preaching to the choir here. The point here is that this clip is badhistory at its finest/worst. \n",

Example: 'Is ____ badhistory?'. These types of posts are NOT allowed. The effort is on you! Please post these types of questions to our Monday/Friday/Monthly threads, or head over to our super small and unique sister sub, /r/AskHistorians. \n\n- A post must have the badhistory quoted in full view. It helps if you put a '&gt;' before it, so the badhistory is formatted \n\n&gt; like this.\n\nIf the badhistory is a video, please provide a summation or a transcript of the badhistory, along with the link. This rule is as simple as copy and paste! You can do it!\n\n- Finally, you must refute the badhistory. A quote from an appropriate source directly refuting the badhistory, or your own explanation of why the selected quote is badhistory. Simply leaving a link and saying \"Here's the explanation\" isn't enough. Cite your sources or experience! Us mods also reserve the right to remove any post that doesn't have enough of that special sauce called effort. \n\nIf you have any questions, please ask bellow!\n\ntl;dr: Follow R5 people!

Many antisemites believed it was real and the Protocol became widely popular after World War I. The Protocols claimed that there was a secret international Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. Hitler had been introduced to The Protocols by Alfred Rosenberg, and from 1920 onward, Hitler focused his attacks on claiming that Judaism and Marxism were directly connected, that Jews and Bolsheviks were one and the same, and that Marxism was a Jewish ideology.

I'm guessing that OP is using the [number of people killed in the holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims) as their metric to rank ethnic groups in order of the hatred directed at them by the Nazis. While admittedly, the Jews and the Slavs were killed in the largest numbers, that doesn't deny the fact that you also have the [Romani genocide.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porajmos) From the linked wikipedia article:   \n\n&gt;Under the rule of Adolf Hitler, a supplementary decree to the Nuremberg Laws was issued on 26 November 1935, defining Gypsies as \"enemies of the race-based state\", the same category as Jews. Thus, the fate of Roma in Europe in some ways paralleled that of the Jews.   \n\nHence, you can't really say that the degree of hatred faced by the Romani was any less than that faced by the Jews or the Slavs, especially when they were arguably grouped in the same (or at least, similar) category. Furthermore, \"most Blacks and persons of color\" also fell under the category of [Untermensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch), and I doubt it's a good idea to imply that they somehow escaped Nazi hatred.   \n\nThe Nazis [believed that:](http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/deruntermensch.html)   \n&gt;Mulattos and Finn-Asian barbarians, Gipsy’s and black skin savages all make up this modern underworld of subhuman’s that is always headed by the appearance of the eternal Jew.   \n\nEdit: Added a few more links, especially to the \"Der Untermensch\" text.",

        "text": "Hey, not sure if anyone has heard of this guy. British conscious rapper and Afrocentric intellectual named Akala. Here is a lecture he gave in Oxford in which he seems to perpetuate Afrocentric-slanted history:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUtAxUQjwB4\n\nFrom the top of my head, he seems to misinterpret a Greek reference to Egyptians as having \"black skin and woolly hair\" when in fact the original term \"melanchoes\" can denote any any color from brown to black and any curly hair not specifically woolly hair. Akala then cites Egyptian influence on Madonna imagery to prove that the world \"evolved spiritually from Africa.\" Similarly with other Egyptian accomplishments; (Egypt was black....Egypt did XYZ, therefore black people did XYZ, therefore everything came from Africa)\n\nHe doesn't seem to realize that the evidence shows that Ancient Egyptians are nearly the same as modern Egyptians. He overstates the impact of Arab conquests on the Egyptian population demographically which was negligible: \n\n\"Afrocentrists claim that Egyptian civilization was a \"black\" civilization, and this is not accurate [...] Most scholars believe that ancient Egyptians looked pretty much like today’s Egyptians - that is, they were brown, becoming darker as they approached the Sudan (Snowden 1970, 1992; Smedley 1993).[34]\"\n\n\nFurthermore, he seems to use the POST-colonial term \"people of color\" anachronistically to describe a variety of (not \"black\") civilizations with a broad brush as implicitly black. \n\n \nThat's all I could debunk from my brief watch. (He references a lot of history that I'm not too familar with). If anyone has time, a thorough debunking of this lecture would be great. This guy says this stuff with such confidence and is definitely a tier above the average afrocentric. Going by the youtube comments, much of his audience seems to be eating it up without not know any better because it tells them what they want to hear. It seems that no one has really called him out on his points or challenged him.\n\n(for the record, I'm black myself before so lets not go there please!).",

        "text": "While this topic obviously comes close to rubbing against Rule #2, let's all please just focus on the history, or rather, the lack thereof.\n\nLike so much bad history in our lives, I came across [this image](http://i.imgur.com/NDI28hx.jpg) on my Facebook feed. For those of you who cannot view this image, it is a picture of Franklin Delano Roosevelt with header text reading \"Something to think about\" (in all caps, of course) and footer text reading \"In 1932 FDR endorsed his opponent before the contested convention. We all know how this story ended.\"\n\nSure, we know how the story ended. FDR was elected to four consecutive terms in the White House. However, we seem to be a bit fuzzy on the beginning, so let's take a look at the Democratic National Convention of 1932. My sources on this are [Wikipedia for the numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_Democratic_National_Convention#Convention) and the [New York Times for the story](http://campaigningforhistory.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/fdrs-rough-road-to-nomination/?_r=0).\n\nAnyway, Roosevelt went into the convention with a huge lead over his next closest opponent. Going into the convention, however, Roosevelt lacked the 2/3 majority necessary at that time to win the primary outright. Just check out the numbers from the first ballot below to see what I mean. Roosevelt had more than 450 votes than Al Smith.\n\nAs such, I submit that this is bad history in two ways. First, the meme only reads \"his opponent\" when he, in fact, had two main ones (Smith and Garner), both of which he was crushing in the delegate count. Second, there's absolutely no evidence that he explicitly endorsed either of his opponents prior to the convention, nor would he have ever been inclined to with the massive delegate lead he had going into the convention.\n\nMorning edit: Thanks to those of you who pointed out when Roosevelt *did* endorse Smith: the previous two elections. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Democratic_National_Convention. So what we have here is a case of *techically* correct while actually being totally wrong or deceptively decontextualized.\n\nBallot Round | \t1 |\t2 | \t3 |\t4 |\n---|---|----|----|----\nGov.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4s8o67/currently_trending_on_rvideos_a_channel_called/",
        "text": "I'll preface my post with two things;\n\n1. First post, please go easy.\n\n2. Thread on /r/videos [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4s5w6m/history_buffs_a_channel_that_checks_the/).\n\n\nNow onto the ~~good~~ stuff. He starts his video with a general overview of Europe before the landings, all pretty generalized and hard to pin down specific elements of bad history. He quips \"Hitler himself was convinced, or more appropriately convinced himself, that it would happen in at the Pas de Calais.\" Hitler certainly wasn't alone in this, seeing as both Von Runstedt and Rommel (Rommel spent most of his time inspecting at the Pas de Calais) expected it more to the east at the least. This, as well as the general military advantage of landing closer to England (easier to supply, maintain air support) combined with the allied efforts of deception leads me to believe that it is difficult to say that Hitler \"convinced himself.\" Hitler might not go down as a great military mind but even I find it hard to blame him for this. \n\nIn fact, Hitler saw through somewhat of the Fortitude deception: \n\n&gt;You can't take shipping concentrations at face value for some kind of clue that their choice fallen on any particular sector of our long western front from Norway down to the Bay of Biscay, such concentrations can always be moved or transferred at any time, under cover of bad visibility, and they will obviously be used to dupe us.\n\nMoreover, if that one doesn't convince you, the allied practicing at Slapton Sands convinced the Führer that Normandy was a real possibility for allied landings because the areas were geographically similar. Indeed, this is why the Americans were practicing there. German troop movement to the Normandy areas further worried Allied command that the Germans knew the actual location of the landings.\n\n\nEnough about that one quote, but this explanation busts some of his assertions he makes after this too. Lets move on.\n\n&gt; However, the one thing the Allies couldn't control was who among the German military leadership was given the task of overseeing the Atlantic Wall, and unfortunately it was one of their most capable commanders; Erwin Rommel. \n\nAnyone subscribed to /r/shitwehraboossay will have had an eye twitch by now. I think most of the visitors on this sub can link five posts to /r/askhistorians explaining Rommel wasn't actually the most super-duper commander the Nazis could bring forward. To provide those of you who are unfortunately unable to provide posts like this I've gone ahead and pulled up some threads myself. \n\n[1.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3f5f6v/why_is_erwin_rommel_so_revered_as_a_military/)\n\n[2.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/27zcvb/today_rommel_is_well_liked_for_many_reason_but_a/)\n\n[3.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dkokk/erwin_rommel_and_stonewall_jackson_common/)\n\n[4.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16vpm3/if_rommel_is_so_widely_considered_one_of_germanys/)\n\n[5.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2j7oyw/why_was_rommel_such_a_bad_corps_commander_though/)\n\nSome criticisms on Rommel are that in the Battle of France he outran his supply and communication lines and that he was a very micromanaging general, often interfering with the chain of command, but also that due to his personal relationship with Hitler he didn't need to obey all orders or play nicely. \n\n\nOnward again, or else we'll never get through this video. \n\nThe first inaccuracy that he points out (almost 8 minutes into the bloody thing) is that the crewman on the landing craft carrying the troops should not be American but British, which is confirmed by all sources I have found including a [letter](http://www.fifthrangers.org/book/page14.html) written to the Royal Navy commending them and their LCA crewmen on the superb job they did in the landing. But the sub isn't called /r/goodhistory so we continue.\n\n\n&gt;With the obstruction ahead obliterated, the soldiers were finally able to charge up the hill. [...] And when word starting reaching the navy that some of the men had successfully broken through the German lines  the order was given to provide artillery support.\n\nDon't you usually have the bombardment BEFORE you assault a position as opposed to when you've broken through? Now I am very sure that the beaches were coated with shells before the troops landed, but according to Wikipedia some destroyers provided fire support on Omaha after the landings stagnated. I've found nothing on the troops breaking through prompting more bombardement though.\n\n\nAfter two American GI's shoot two supposedly Czech soldiers he remarks:\n\n&gt;It shows that Allies committed atrocities the same way Germans did.\n\nAlthough he is right that no side had clean hands and not all Americans were good and not all Germans were evil, does this mean that we can compare the scale of atrocities between Nazi-\"raping and pillaging their way through Eastern Europe\"-Germany and some individual American GI's? I am not defending the GI's here, the MP's should court martial them for murdering men who had surrendered, but the Germans barely did anything of the sort to limit the terrible behavior of their soldiers in the East. So no, \"the same way Germans did\" is not accurate.\n\nThe other thing he mentions is that he loves the fact that this tiny detail of the Ostlegionen was included in the film. However, I have been unable to find any evidence that there were any Ostlegionen units stationed at Omaha, only Utah, Juno, and Sword. Thus making this detail inaccurate. He also does not mention that these men could have joined the Ostlegionen voluntarily but does mention drafting POW's forcibly. (I'm not actually sure if that is accurate, can you forcibly draft POW's? Wasn't that on volunteering basis too? I guess you could argue that getting a choice between being held captive or not is not really a choice.) I personally will not assume anything about how these men got to serving the Germans but I think it's important to tell a complete story instead of making up one yourself. \n\n\nThen we're somehow at the end already and he says:\n\n&gt;As a movie Saving Private Ryan is not without its historical inaccuracies. In fact, it's guilty of having many.\n\n¿QUE? You mentioned like ONE historical inaccuracy and then you close your video with a conclusion like this? YOU DIDN'T PROVE SHIT! Your video has more historical inaccuracies then you brought to light! \nThus the video ends with barely any material left for me to comment on, now en doubting me that the video was even worth trying to write a post on. I hope that my post was better than his video.\n\nI'd also like to end with some personal wisdom I have attained over the last few years, which is that someone who describes/introduces themselves as a \"history buff\" is not to be taken seriously. Ever. \n\nAlso, sources (duh):\n\n+ Various Wikipedia pages for some small fact checking.\n\n+ http://www.fifthrangers.org/\n\n+ D-Day: *June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II* by Stephen E.

        "text": "Another day and another Badhistory review. I figure I have a lot to make up for after more than a month of silence, so I shall subject myself to another episode of Peter Woodwards's Conquest. This particular instalment is based on a fantasy novel and is called Warriors of the Bible, which is really quite suitable as I seem to be engaging in the sin of gluttony for punishment:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS2_9BbOauk\n\n As wine was frequently mentioned in the text, I once again have a bottle of mead. So we shall follow the footsteps of the Israelites:\n\n0.26: I'm having trouble deciding if this is meant to be a depiction of a battle in ancient Egypt or a nerf-blade fight organized by several college fraternities.\n\n 0.36: The host states that the Bible provides a detailed military history of the 12 Tribes of Israel's fight for survival. Whilst I myself proudly associate with the faction that argues that the Bible is indeed a valuable primary text, I am not going to be offering any criticism as to how much of the content is factual during this review. I shall stick to military history, which is my field of expertise.\n\n0.50: One of those axe designs is clearly not from the Bronze Age. A Bronze Age axe would look like this:\n\nhttp://www.larp.com/hoplite/JP4.jpg\n\nOr this:\n\nhttp://thebaidunshop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/k/b/kb_br_9957aw.jpg\n\nThe axe in question looks much more similar to this:\n\nhttp://www.trueswords.com/images/prod/ts-rmnbtlaxe1.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n1.00: The host says Egypt is to the south of Israel. South of Israel is a portion of Arabia and the Red Sea. Egypt is much more to the south-west. BAD GEOGRAPHY DRINK!\n\n1.25: The host says the Israelites controlled Canaan/Israel for most of 1200 years. Absolutely incorrect. If we start from 1300 BC, we see that it was ruled by the New Kingdom of Egypt. The Merneptah stele from 1207 BC mentions that Israel was laid waste during an Egyptian campaign. From there the next mention of the Israelites comes from Assyrian sources, where Israel and Judah are referred to. Assyria conquered Israel in the 720's, and Judah was destroyed when Babylon captured Jerusalem in 586 BC. During this period the region was effectively either annexed or a protectorate of a more powerful state. After Babylon the area came under the rule of the Persians and then the various Hellenistic powers. So if we assume that the Israelites ruled themselves prior to 750 BC (As a single kingdom under Solomon), it would have to have been independent after 1100 BC or so once Egypt declined. This means Israelites controlled the region for only 300 years or more. Combine that with Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties, and the Israelites only had 430 years, more or less, in which they ruled themselves. Remember these are only very rough figures, and I am in no way an expert, as I scrounged these details from my books. DRINK! \n\n1.30: The host shows us several weapons of the Bible, including two Greek Xiphos, a Mainz-style Gladius and other blades that originate from nowhere near the period in question. DRINK!\n\n1.40: The host says in the 18th century BC there was a great movement of peoples from the east into the eastern Mediterranean region. The trouble is, besides the Hyksos conquest, I could not find records of any other migrations. There were the Amorites, but they went east into Mesopotamia, not Canaan/Israel/Palestine/Egypt. DRINK!\n\n1.50: The host asserts the armies of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt used weapons of bronze, stone and wood. By this time copper and bronze were dominant, not stone and wood. Stone and wood were used as the points of arrows, but that is about it. DRINK!\n\n2.37: The host states that, after the Hyksos, mass archery ruled the battlefield. Mass archery also ruled the battlefield before the Hyksos invasion. The only difference was the design of the bow. DRINK!\n\n2.45: The first recorded encounter against the forces of Herbaceous II, Tyrant of the Hay Bale Imperium.\n\n3.17:  \"Sometime during the 13th century BCE they were led out of bondage in Egypt by their leader, Moses\". The name of the ruling Pharaoh? Christian Grey.\n\n3.53. The host states the Bronze Age Israelites used stone spears and blades. No they bloody well did not! It was called the Bronze Age for a reason. Weapons made with this material were by far the most common and had been traded widely for 2000 years by this stage. DRINK!\n\n4.34: Back to the Xiphos! DRINK!\n\n4.56: Calls a broad-sword a long-sword. DRINK!\n\n5.53: Earlier the host said one does not use bronze swords to cut against shields. Next he advocates using a bronze sword to cut against a shield. SELF-CONTRADICION DRINK!\n\n6.15: Using a spear without a shield. DRINK!\n\n6.36:  Another senseless killing of an innocent bale. OH THE HAYMANITY!\n\n7.08: HOLLYWOOD SPIN! DRINK!\n\n7.30: \"From around 9000 BCE began the process we call civilization\". Civilization was actually released in 1991, around 10,000 years later. DRINK!\n\n8.17: A depiction of the Sumerian phalanx is actually just some figurines of Egyptians. DRINK!\n\n9.29: Medieval battle-axe is shown. DRINK! \t\n\n9.53: Silly Israelites. You can never successfully fight Philistines, they just drag you down to their level.\n\n10.12: One could say there was a (  •_•)  ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■  (⌐■_■)  mish-mash of military forces present. YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!\n\n10.52: ACTING.....SO.....BAD.....MUST.....NOT....STAB....SELF...TO....END....PAIN.\n\n11.26: The host asserts a shield bearer would fight without a weapon. Yeah, there was no such thing as an unarmed shield-bearer. For example, Assyrian shield-bearers always used a spear when protecting archers. DRINK!\n\n12.31: Discount Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n15.12: Obviously fake horse sounds make it clear the chariot is being pulled by a car. \n\n15.40: Host states the only defence against a chariot was another chariot. Wrong. The horse were vulnerable to arrows and javelins, and a solid infantry formation could repel a chariot charge. DRINK!\n\n17.21: Spear fighting without a shield. DRINK!\n\nWell, that episode certainly lived up to the deplorable standard Conquest has established for itself. See you next time!\n\nReferences\n\nJ. Maxwell Miller &amp; John H. Hayes.

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! It has been quite some time since my last review, but when one moves to a completely different state to commence a new job, this is to be expected. The subject of today's examination is Conquest, Episode 20: Roman Weapons, written and hosted by my arch-enemy, Peter Woodward:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7OzLQQlL0k\n\nSince the Romans were heavy wine drinkers, it would be expected that I have with me one of the many Italian varieties, but since wine is generally a symbol of the effete socialist university and activist milieu, I am going with mead because of its inherent masculinity. So let us begin!\n\n0.10: Impressive. Ten seconds in and the host has already engaged in badhistory. I believe this is new a record. The host calls the Roman Empire the greatest force in ancient history. Now, as much as I love the Roman Empire, the military of the Han Empire can certainly be argued to be superior, if only on a technological level (in terms of siege machinery and weapons such as the every glorious crossbow). The army of the Mauryan empire was also quite formidable and a possible match. The host also states the Roman army was the basis for every professional army since. Really? How does he come to that conclusion? The Macedonians and Achaemenid Persians maintained standing forces as well. Likewise standing forces evolved for different reasons. They may have been employed because they could be more efficient at responding to threats, or were better at enforcing order when a state ruled several foreign territories. A ruler might recruit professional troops to enhance his own authority within his own country. There are a myriad of factors that led to the growth of a permanent military, which cannot be connected to the Romans alone. Two drinks for each error. DRINK! DRINK!\n\n0.42: The host remarks that Roman soldiers had an absolute confidence in victory and a refusal to accept defeat. Whilst Roman troops certainly developed a reputation for tenaciousness (such as in their battles against Pyrrhus of Epirus), they were certainly capable of panicking and retreating. In Spain, Viriathus certainly sent a few Roman armies into flight at Tribola, Venus Mountain and against generals like Servilianus. DRINK!\n\n4.16: The host states the Gladius Hipsaniensis was the sword that won an empire and was introduced in the 4th century BC. Uh, no. It is thought by scholars that the Gladius was adopted in the 3rd century BC after contact with Spanish warriors. Additionally, it was Roman political and military organization that won them an empire, not a single weapon design. This can be seen by the fact that the Romans had conquered much of Italy, fought off Pyrrhus and kicked Punic butt all whilst using the Greek Xiphos. Two drinks for each mistake. DRINK! DRINK!\n\n5.31: The Roman method of building a fortified camp must have been centered around \"gently tapping the ground\".\n\n5.50: The host states that, whilst building a camp, the Romans worked in full armour. Exceptionally doubtful. Fighting whilst wearing armour is extremely tiring. Constructing something whilst wearing armour would be absolute lunacy, especially if one had been marching all day. The construction of a camp would look more like this:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b3/3c/e0/b33ce0ae9089d13166ff641e81a29d2c.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n5.54: The \"barbarian\" in this shot is using a spear in two hands without a shield. You know what they would call a warrior who fought in such a style? Dead. DRINK!\n\n8.27: Roman Centurion is not speaking English when giving commands, nor does he have a received British accent. DRINK!\n\n9.12: The host said that any unit that showed cowardice in battle faced decimation. Actually, there were various punishments available for cowardice, and by the time of the Principate decimation was quite unusual. In this thread:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3ji8nf/do_we_have_any_personal_accounts_of_roman_a/?ref=search_posts\n\nThe knowledgeable u/Astrogator provides a quote from Tacitus referring to the use of decimation as being exceptional and from an old tradition. This makes it clear that the practices was hardly as common as the host makes it out to be, and was considered old-fashioned in any event. DRINK!\n\n11.09: The host says that the Scutum was not meant to be hidden behind but rather used offensively, demonstrating the usage of the Scutum by simply pushing against an opponent for an extended moment. This never happened. The Scutum was obviously meant to be hidden behind since the host had just shown Roman troops doing so by forming a Testudo. Likewise, a Roman soldier would bash the enemy with his shield before striking with his sword. Tacitus wrote that \"No sooner did the Batavians begin to close with the enemy, to strike them with their shields, to disfigure their faces\". Pushing like the host did in a battle would mean the Roman soldier would advance past his own line and become vulnerable to attacks from the side. DRINK! \n\n12.06: The host states the pilum was not a defensive weapon meant to hold the enemy off. Except it could be used in such a fashion. Arrian, is his Order of Battle Against the Alans states that in the army \"the front four ranks of the formation must be of spearmen, whose spear points end in thin iron shanks. And the foremost of them should hold them at the ready, in order that when the enemies near them, they can thrust the iron points of the spears at the breast of the horses in particular\". DRINK!\n\n12.26: The host says the Gladius changed the world. Again, it was Roman tactics and organization that proved decisive, not an individual weapon. DRINK!\n\n12.25: The host calls a Roman Spatha a long-sword. The long-sword was a specific weapon quite distinct from the one-handed broad-sword. The long-sword only appeared in the later medieval period and had a long grip. DRINK!\n\n14.43: The host states that a Spatha could only be used with a shield which had to be held in one hand. Ignoring the blatant fact that all shields were intended to used in one hand, the Iron Age Celts and Late Roman soldiers had no problem using a broad-sword with a large shield. DRINK!\n\n12.47: Host has been engaging in extended Hollywood blade twirling that makes me want to stab someone. DRINK!\n\n13.02: The host states the Falcata was only viable in a downward chop. As a cutting weapon, the Falcata could be used in strikes aimed from the side, aiming upwards and even in stabbing as it still possessed a keen point. DRINK!\n\n13.06: Host demonstrates the vulnerability of striking with a Falcata by holding his shield to the sides and asserting his opponent could then stab him. All this demonstrates is his incompetence. It is fairly easy to cover yourself with a shield whilst striking downwards. I have done it in training myself. DRINK!\n\n12.23:  The host states cutting with a Gladius is a complete waste of time. I have handled various Gladii replica and the point of balance often varies. The Mainz style had their point of balance towards the point of the blade, making the weapon a lethal cutter. There are also references in primary sources as to the viability of cutting with the Gladius. DRINK!\n\n14.07: The host asserts that Roman soldiers needed to know how to read and write to follow orders. Whilst there is plenty of evidence that makes it clear many Roman warriors were literate, literacy itself was not a requirement to enlist. It was the upper ranks that were literate, and they transmitted orders to the regular soldier verbally. DRINK!\n\n14.41: \"The weapon is short, aggressive. You have to get in close\".  Hehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n15.01: The shields used by the opposing side is completely ahistorical considering the time period. They resemble violin shields used by the Achaemenid Persians around 500 hundred year earlier:\n\nhttp://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/Images2/Achaemenid/Persepolis/guards.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n15.08: A medieval flanged spear similar to this one is depicted: \n\nhttp://www.preferredarms.com/images/weapons/large/polearms/4-Viking-Spear.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n15.26: The tactic the host demonstrates was only viable against pikemen who had their formation broken only by the terrain or casualties from missiles. It would not work against a shield-wall as the additional ranks could still strike at him. DRINK!\n\n15.40: Apparently the Romans fought against cultures equipped with Viking weapons around 700 years too early.
