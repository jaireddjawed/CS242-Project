I don't have social media (twitter, facebook, etc. I even made this reddit account just to get answers. I do have discord, which is where this was brought up in conversation, but I find some servers tend to be echo chambers)\n\nI know it has been a few years since all of this started, but I really just need someone to explain all of it to me. I keep getting wildly different answers when I ask. I'm not an HP fan and haven't been since 2007, and that awful epilogue. It all came up in a conversation the other night about the new game that has come out, to which I had no answers or ability to talk about things.\n\nI read JKR's \"manifesto\" the other night for the first time under the advice of a (trans) friend, and I don't know if I am naïve or what, but to me it read as protecting women's rights but I have been told that it is not what it is about. \n\nI am not making this post as a \"aha gotcha\" towards Trans people, I am in the process of seeing a therapist about my own gender issues, so I really do not stand on a side of hate, more of confusion and a wish to know a solid answer. (If that makes sense?) \n\nIf someone could break it all down into bullet points or something that makes the whole thing easier for me to understand, I would be extremely grateful. I struggle to understand when it is rapid chatfire/large blocks of text.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": " \n\nI think James Corden is funny, entertaining and a good show host. People just like to hop on the bandwagon of people shitting on him.\n\nI have been so curious about why people hate Corden so much that I have been researching where all the hate is coming from. From what I can tell, the biggest reason people don't like him is that there is so much of him in the media. I read an [article](https://reelrundown.com/celebrities/Reasons-Why-People-Hate-James-Corden-So-Much) that pointed out the \"Top 5 Reasons\" people hate this guy and none of them were valid in my opinion. In fact, some of the reasons presented actually made him appear \\*more\\* endearing to me.\n\n* The guy stood up against fat shaming in a way that did not say that obesity was okay or healthy, and then got fat shamed.\n* Corden got bullied for being fat by a drunk Patrick Stewart while he was hosting an award ceremony (who later apologized and acknowledged that he was drunk).\n* Corden flopped a standup he was doing at a Hollywood event by making inappropriate jokes about Harvey Weinstein, which was definitely cringey, and out of touch with the given audience, but Ricky Gervais has said way worse (but also funnier and with much better delivery) and gotten away with it.\n* People say he comes off as being fake. Okay, sure. But I can think of at least 3 other show hosts that I find way more intolerably fake than Corden. This just seems like a matter of taste to me. Which is fine, like if the majority of people just think he's a crappy show host then that's fair and valid, I just don't personally think he is any worse than the other late night hosts.\n* The final reason is basically that he's just everywhere and people are sick of him. That's fair! But it seems like this could be true for any celebrity, kind of like how a lot of people were sick of Dwayne Johnson when Black Adam came out.\n\nTLDR; Corden isn't bad. I think he is actually entertaining, and most people just like to shit on him because it's popular and easy to do so.",
