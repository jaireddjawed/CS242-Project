So I compiled numbers from the Netflix Top 10 and here is what I got.\n\nOn average, a season of a show that makes it into the Top 10 spends 4.3 weeks that and has 30.1 million hours watched per week.\n\nA show that makes it into the Top 5 spends 2.6 weeks there and has 46.4 million hours watched.\n\nSo you would expect the cancelled shows to perform much worse than that, right?  (Remember, just making it into the Top 10 is an accomplishment considering the number of shows Netflix has in its catalogue.)\n\n***1899*** spent five weeks in the Top 10, four weeks in the Top 5 (three weeks at Number 2) and averaged 51.4 million hours per week overall while in the Top 10 and 59.8 million hours per week while in the Top 5.   That is definitely better than the streamer's average top performer, so why exactly did it not count as \"successful\"?\n\n***Fate: The Winx Saga*** spent five weeks in the Top 10 and three weeks in the Top 5 averaging 32.2 million hours of viewing per week while in the Top 10 and 45.4 million hours per week while in the Top 5.  That is in line with the streamer's other top performers and it sure seems like that one should have received a third season renewal.\n\n***Warrior Nun*** spent three weeks in the Top 10 and one in the Top 5, averaging 22.0 million hours per week overall.  That is lower than the top performers but not bad considering that the second season received *absolutely no promotion*.\n\nThere are more examples at the link above, and this is just a cursory analysis.  But it pretty much shuts down the claim by Sarandos that Netflix does not cancel \"successful\" shows.",
