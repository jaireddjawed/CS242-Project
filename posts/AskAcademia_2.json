I worked so hard throughout high school (multiple research projects, physics olympiads...) to increase my chances of getting into a US university with a great math and physics program. (I'm not from the US but I'll have to go there for undergrad for some reasons) In that sense, I've been recommended to apply early to safer schools to sort of have a 'guarantee' admission as I need financial aid. However, I was always dreaming of getting into a 'prestigious' as I believe that will open the doors to very good Ph.D. programs later on. \n\nSo now, I'm stuck between applying to safer schools where I'll probably be among the top of my class but with low to no undergrad research experience &amp;/or apply to prestigious highly competitive schools just for the sake of ending in a good school for Ph.D.\n\nI'm very serious about my studies and future and my interest in doing academia &amp; research in the future and I cannot just jump into my undergrad thinking about what's coming after!",

An example would be citing the work of an scholar, with a superscript to denote the footnote. The footnote would be just: Epstein (1977, 19). \n\nThe end of the book has a bibliography as common practice.

        "text": "\nSo the title pretty much sums up my situation, I will to keep it as brief as possible. \n\nI’m a 3rd year biomed PhD student in the UK, with about 1 year left of funded lab work to do. My funding runs out in April 2024 but I have until October 2024 to hand my thesis in, although those 6 months would be unpaid so I want to be done by April ideally. \n\nLong story short but I’ve genuinely had the most stressful, awful 2.5 years of my life since starting my PhD in October 2020. \n\n6 months into my PhD, my supervisor told me that he would be leaving academia and taking up a new role. I was left with a post doc to supervise me, who then left two weeks later. During my first year progress review I had nothing at all to show for my PhD and it was a disaster. I made the decision to move to a new lab, with a new supervisor and project in early summer 2021.\n\nThis was already tough, as I was nearly a year behind my peers but I decided it would be exciting and I loved the sound of the new project and supervisor… one thing to bare in mind is she is a relatively new supervisor and there were only 2 other PhD students in her lab writing up (I wish I’d taken this into consideration tbh but hindsight is a wonderful thing, right). \n\nEverything started okay in her lab - I did a couple of basic experiments to get my head around the project but there was never a real aim behind anything I was doing. Fast forward to January 2022 and she leaves the university temporarily with no explanation for 3 months. I was left totally on my own so had to contact my external supervisor at another university who luckily recommended some basic experiments for me to crack on with and do in her absence.\n\nMy supervisor then comes back from her leave, still not telling us where or why she went. She comes back full of ideas of things for me to do, so I start working on a really complex biological model which seemed super cool but I needed loads of help with it. My supervisor then tells me that she’s now pregnant and will be going on maternity leave (!). This was right at the critical point of needing help so this was a huge shock, especially as I am already behind everyone else and it felt like history repeating itself with being abandoned by my supervisor again. \n\nI was supposed to go to my first ever international conference with her and she decided a week before that she wouldn’t be going and I had to attend by myself, which sucked. I spoke to the students who finished in her lab recently and they said that she is awful, unsupportive and a really shitty supervisor who pretends to be nice when you first start in her group.\n\nI managed to struggle on and get a few bits of data with this biological model but tbh it was really bloody difficult and incredibly lonely. I’m the only person in her lab as her other PhDs are writing up or now finished. I attempted to basically do a whole PhD completely on my own as there were no support options and the university rejected my application for an extension twice (their reason was that I don’t need it apparently?!?! Wtf). Last summer I had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and signed off work. Every single day I would wake up and burst into tears at the thought of being in the lab, I couldn’t think straight and I completely lost my personality.\n\nI’ve now started in ANOTHER lab with another supervisor and I’m trying my best to be positive. However the old feelings are creeping back and I honestly think what is the point? I’ve given everything to this PhD and it’s taken so much from me. I hate lab work, I hate doing the PhD and I don’t want anything to do with academia anymore as I love writing (and would love to be a medical writer). \n\nA huge part of me wants to pack it all in as I’ve had such a crap experience and been totally let down. I genuinely can’t see a way out of this or it improving. But on the other hand I only have 1 year left so almost want to finish it out of spite.\n\nI just really wish the second supervisor I had was honest with me and told me she was likely going to be leaving or planning on having a baby. I spoke to a few other supervisors in addition to her and would have chosen them in a heartbeat if I’d known she was planning on leaving. \n\nIf my experience in academia had been a normal one I’d feel positive and differently about it, as when I started I wanted to be an academic! But now the motivation, enjoyment and love for it is non existent and I don’t know what to do.\n\nEdit: I have one chapter completed but none of this is novel. I have 1 year left to finish off the two other chapters and try to get the model to work and get interesting data - it just seems impossible right now :( I basically feel so incredibly lonely, shit about myself constantly, unsupportive and stressed 24/7 because I need help and no one is able to give it to me. I don’t need spoon feeding by any means but trying to do a PhD completely alone is really really difficult.\n\nTLDR: had quite possibly the worst PhD experience ever, but don’t know whether to finish it out of spite or chase a career I actually want to do.",

        "text": "I wanted to vent a bit and  on one hand, but I am also kind of asking for advice.  I feel like involving third parties in the process of application before the moment the candidate is shortlisted is just too much...\n\nI finished my master's degree 1,5 years ago and worked with my advisor in a research project. I have been looking for a PhD position since like a year and a half and applied for many scholarships and got some interviews but did not find a position. I consider the possibility that I am just not good enough, but I can also see that there is A LOT of competition,  so many people apply to many places. Many applications mean many letters of recommendation. And it would be best if these letters mentioned the specific program. I think it's not fair to make people rely so much on other people when seeking jobs. \n\nWhen I asked for the first few letters, profs who know me best were very happy to help. Now I feel like the letters are less enthusiastic  and  people are less responsive. I know it has to do with my MA advisor's and his colleague's workload, but I feel it's also just bothersome for him at this point (Or maybe it's my paranoia). I understand why are references needed, but why can't they be contacted if the candidate is already shortlisted?  \n\nSo now the advice part... I have a generic letter written for a different position last year. Can I just attach an old letter to a new application because I do not want to bother people? Or is it a horrendously bad idea? Any other advice?",

I'm posting this for my friend because they don't have reddit. \n\nwe're in humanities if that matters. \n\n\nSo my friend is having their preliminary seminar next week, and there is an older professor who's really a wealth of academic information in my department, and we want that prof to attend since their field of study is similar to what my friend is doing. However, they are not always available at uni, and unless you have made an appointment to meet, they will not be there. \n\n\nmy friend's supervisor is really young (mid thirties) and when my friend brought up the issue of inviting the older prof, the supervisor literally replied \"I don't advise you do that\". Without providing any reason why not. The older prof won't get the invitation from the department, and unless my friend lets them know they wouldn't be there. We were both taught in undergraduate by the older prof, and they are the direct reason why we've decided to go into academia. Having the prof in the seminar isn't just valuable for the validity of my friend's claim, but also important emotionally. This older prof is the only remaining shining beacon and we have learnt everything from them. \n\n\nmy friend's current supervisor, however, is sharp and moody and reacts badly if you don't follow their exact commands. If my friend ignores the supervisor, it could mean terrible things. \n\n\nmy question is: should my friend ignore the supervisor and invite the older prof anyways despite the supervisor warning her not to do so? or just follow the supervisor and deal with the fact the seminar would be missing the valuable comments this older prof would have? \n\n\nIt's a tough situation to be in, and I'm hoping someone would have insight on what we should do. \nI personally would just send emails and invite every prof in the department, since they are required to attend. But at the same time the supervisor should not be crossed.",

Were there differences in the way you or your family were treated depending on the place you lived or school you attended?\n​3. How was it making friends? Did your parents have any say on who could be your friend? Who made up your family? To what extent was your culture emphasized in your family (if the person you are interviewing is from a different culture)?\n​4. Did you notice any difference in the way you were treated versus how others were treated? Were your teachers’ expectations different for you than they were for others in the class?\n​5. How did you go about figuring out your identity? Were there role models for you?\n​6. Have you had experiences of discrimination, racism, or prejudice?\n​7. How do you feel about White privilege?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/11mfobd/advice_pursuing_philosophy_phd_over_cs_phd/",
        "text": "I'm currently an undergraduate in my second year doing a double major in computer science and philosophy. My institution (University of Washington) is quite competitive for the former but not so much for the latter. I have been very involved in computer science research and have been doing research since my first quarter in a hot field (AI), so I am certain that if I continued in that direction I would be able to secure a spot in a competitive CS PhD program.\n\nThe trouble is that my heart is just tired of doing CS. I love talking about the ideas, but in terms of actually conducting the research, I just can't do it. I almost had a breakdown submitting my last paper, and somehow I have signed myself up to lead another research project. I also do not want to go into industry; I really did not like my time at an internship I did last summer. It took me here to really realize that doing CS work is just not for me.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm always excited to do philosophy, and after a lot of reflection in these past few months, I feel like I would want to pursue a philosophy PhD and do philosophy academically. I've done well (4.0s) in all my philosophy classes, read philosophy books outside of class for fun, and have good relationships with professors (one whom I am continuing independent study with). I'm a pretty lonely and materially unambitious person, so facts like difficulties with romantic relationships, not having kids, not being financially stable, etc. don't deter me. I am the type of person to consume myself in the work I do and I feel like my dream work is philosophy. My dream, if you will indulge me, would be to make my academic career working on a continental approach to the philosophy of AI (specifically: working out an ontology, phenomenology, and politics of information in deep learning models).\n\nHere are some more points for consideration:\n\n* The reason I want to pursue a philosophy PhD is because I feel that even though CS is getting better at entertaining non-technical perspectives (e.g. in HCI or social computing), philosophy isn't really seriously considered. What I want to do is to work on the philosophy of AI, not AI with a philosophical bent (which often ends up subjugating and appropriating philosophy for CS purposes). But I'm curious if my view is false or incomplete.\n* My institution isn't ranked very highly for philosophy, even though I've enjoyed the classes. But it's also a very analytic department and there are no faculty who work in the philosophy of AI (closest person is one person in philosophy of mind). Moreover, philosophy of AI is a very specific and new field and the approaches are basically all analytic (I don't think I'm interested in philosophy of mind approaches -- I think they're done in a vacuum and old). This is all to say that my dream of working in continental approaches to the philosophy of AI is highly improbable.\n* Despite this, I think that at least philosophy of AI seems to be an area of philosophy which maybe has more funding and attention due to recent events and trends than others, so maybe there is some hope there. I'm sort of hanging on to this idea.\n* Even though my department is analytic, I've done a lot of my own independent reading in continental philosophy and taken classes with continental philosophy content (English, Comparative History of Ideas, Comparative Literature, etc. -- Marxism, phenomenology, Derrida, etc.). So I feel like I have enough of a grasp of continental philosophy to know that I want to pursue it. \n* My parents of course want me to go to CS industry and are very unhappy about a philosophy PhD. My connection with them isn't too strong and ultimately if I think doing a philosophy PhD is the right choice I will do it. But in an ideal world I'd like them to support me, and to be able to support them if needed when they get older.\n\nI know that, given the material conditions, pursuing a philosophy PhD over a CS PhD is pretty stupid. But I really just do not want to pursue CS/deep learning rigorously beyond undergrad; I would love to philosophize about it from the outside (where I think it needs to be). What I would love for people to comment on is if I need a reality check, if my goals are possible, and if they are, what steps I can do to maximize my possibility of actualizing it in the remaining two years of my undergrad.",

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nNew here, so apologies if I'm missing any rules. \n\nQuestion is essentially what's in the title. I'm deciding between PhD programs, and have found myself in the classic dilemma. One school is considered a top 50 university, but definitely not known for it's PhD programs, and particularly unknown in this field (although, the faculty swear this will change soon). At this school I'd have my pick of multiple potential advisors, all who are super cool, do awesome research, and who are eager to help their students land whatever job they want after graduation. \n\nThe other school is a top 20ish university that is much more established in this space. However, I'm not a very strong research fit, and I don't really know who I'd work with.\n\nSince it likely matters, I'm in a field where hierarchy dictates a ton (not Economics, but think like Economics), and I plan to go non-academic after graduating. For years I was told go to the best place I get in regardless of fit, so I found it a little strange when now advice seems to be suggesting I should go where I'd have the best advisor relationship. It's also worth noting that both schools offered similar funding packages, and I'm indifferent on the locations. \n\nThanks for all the help and happy to answer any questions as needed!",

My project depends on blog posts I made in a class earlier in my undergraduate career and my advisor was the instructor for this course.

I’ve already cleared with IRB that this is not human research and am almost done with my paper. \n\nHere is where the hiccup comes in. I sent my most recent draft to my advisor and in my methods section I explain the processes I went through to clear the project with the IRB, noting that prior to my application to the board, I omitted personal identifiers from the posts and saved the posts to a password protected document that has been used as a quick way to reference my posts and that would be deleted following the completion of my project. \n\nIn the comments she left on my draft, she noted that I shouldn’t have had to omit personal identifier (mostly names) because I shouldn’t have included them in the first place per the section in our syllabus stating that our dealings in the classroom were to remain confidential. Admittedly, I had not encountered confidentiality rules/expectations throughout my undergraduate career and understood it to mean that we are not to discuss things involving personal identifiers outside of the classroom or classroom materials. This was, of course, incorrect and in reflecting I should have inquired what confidentiality entailed. As such, personal identifiers were originally included in my blog posts, but as noted were later amended for fake names and other identifiers were removed. \n\nMy question is this - I currently explain this mistake in my “methods” section because I feel very bad about making this mistake and I want to be forthcoming. At the same time, I want to give this paper to the school I volunteered at and I don’t want to seem careless or inconsiderate of those observed. Any advice as to how to go about addressing this?

I have a couple of 2nd-3rd author publications in top-tier venues and one first-author publication in the top-tier venue as well. My first-author publication was very innovative, I got some awards for it, so all is fine (or seems to be). Small remark: the topic of the work is outside of my advisor's expertise, it was something that they wanted to explore and learn more about, and I was interested as well, so we went all in. As a result, we got a very interesting paper (took me almost 2.5 years), and my advisor and I were very happy.\n\nHowever, here my luck seems to run out. To graduate, I need a second publication. During the last couple of months, I tried to build upon my published work, but I had no success. I tried a couple of ideas my advisor and I came up with, but nothing worked. I tried to branch out to a different topic that is somewhat related to my first published work, but my advisor was not interested because they had no interest in doing open-source projects. I, on the other hand, am sure that my tool will be a success, will be impactful, and will help the community (I wanted to make an open-source tool for some form of analysis. Currently, there is nothing available, and everyone does their own thing). At the same time, I spent so much time trying to make my \"extension\" ideas work that now I feel zero inspiration for this particular problem.\n\nNow I have one more year to graduate before the funding runs out, and I need something to work on. My advisor just took a leave of absence for this semester (and the summer, potentially fall as well) to work at their company. They want to me to make some of the extensions work, but I am convinced that it won't, and even if it will, it won't be good enough for top tier venue. At the same time I understand that branching out into a new direction will take time. I would need to read a lot, let it sink, etc. But, to be honest, I see nothing else I can do.\n\nI wonder if some of you were in similar situations and how you solved your problems.\n\nThank you!\n\nPS I intentionally kept details vague for privacy.",

There is little to no positive reinforcement at all. It has annoyed me so much I don’t want to say anything but now she comments my silence as well. I don’t feel like my work is meaningful, I don’t see any appreciation of my efforts. I told her once that if she is so much unhappy I should leave, and she replied that she values me a lot, but the next day everything returned as it was. I am becoming more and more anxious and irritated. At first, I was able to tolerate it but now it really is affecting my performance and self-esteem. I need at least couple hours every time I meet with her to get cool down. I feel a need to start responding to her comments and speak up for myself, but I don’t how and I am afraid if I escalate I won’t be able to win the argument.",

People gave me very good advice on that post, so perhaps they can give me some on my current situation.\n\nI am a first-year PhD student, and I have been struggling with mental health problems. In the broad strokes I am recovering from some very serious issues a year or two ago (before starting the program), and my ability to function is much better but it is still not perfect. Getting work done has been much more difficult than it should be. Last quarter, I was worried about this impacting my performance (as described in the previous post), but thankfully everything worked out and I did well in all my classes. I was also able to apply for accommodations from the disability office, as everyone suggested, and I got them, which has been very helpful. So in theory everything is going well.\n\nHowever, progress has still been rocky, and this quarter my performance has definitely been impacted by my issues. A possibly relevant detail is that I had some physical health problems come up at the beginning of the quarter as well, which are now totally resolved but which frankly set me back a bit in terms of my mental health progress. One way or other, my performance has been impacted this quarter, and I am not doing massively well in any of my classes. I believe things can be salvaged in two of them, but there is at least one that I am probably going to have to drop or take an incomplete. I am worried about how this might affect my progress towards my degree, my funding, and my general reputation in the department. I have been in communication with all my professors about this and they have been very understanding, but of course there is only so much leeway they can extend me.\n\nI am not sure what to do; does anyone have any thoughts or recommendations?",

My first-author publication was very innovative, I got some awards for it, so all is fine (or seems to be). Small remark: the topic of the work is outside of my advisor's expertise, it was something that he wanted to explore and learn more about, and I was interested as well, so we went all in. As a result, we got a very interesting paper (took me almost 2.5 years), and my advisor and I were very happy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, here my luck seems to run out. To graduate, I need a second publication. During the last couple of months, I tried to build upon my published work, but I had no success. I tried a couple of ideas my advisor and I came up with, but nothing worked. I tried to branch out to a different topic that is somewhat related to my first published work, but my advisor was not interested because he had no interest in doing open-source projects. I, on the other hand, am sure that my tool will be a success, will be impactful, and will help the community (I wanted to make an open-source tool for some form of analysis. Currently, there is nothing available, and everyone does their own thing). At the same time, I spent so much time trying to make my \"extension\" ideas work that now I feel zero inspiration for this particular problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I have one more year to graduate before the funding runs out, and I need something to work on. My advisor just took a leave of absence for this semester (and summer) to work at his company. I understand that branching out into a new direction will take time. I would need to read a lot, let it sink, etc. But, to be honest, I see nothing else I can do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wonder if some of you were in similar situations and how you solved your problems. \n\nThank you!",

I also come from an under-funded university/country and I have not had the same opportunities as other labs in central Europe and US. After applying to quite a few positions all over the world, I got an offer from a small college in East Coast, US, for a  2 year NIH funded project. The project fits very well my research interests and my current technical skills and allows me to learn more things and also continue developing my research line the way I imagine it. However, I'm not sure I understand the differences between colleges and universities in the US and what that would mean for me. I've asked and the PI has strong connections to the university that is nearby, so I wouldn't be just in the college.\n\nI'm planning to move with my partner to the US so there are a lot of issues to consider, especially since he will be looking for employment as well. \n\nOther academics moving from Europe to the US, what advice do you have? Staying in my country and remaining happily in academia is not something I consider. What do you think I should make sure to ask before accepting the offer? \n\nThank you!",

Despite having a great academic track record, including a distinction in my BSc(H) and MPhil in Stats, I'm struggling to secure a research position in academia or industry. I'm not sure if this is just imposter syndrome or if it's due to the fierce competition out there.\n\nHere's my situation: during my PhD, I wasn't as productive in terms of publications as I would have liked. Although my research was novel and my supervisor and examiners thought highly of it, I don't have any publications from my PhD work. However, I did manage to get an impact factor paper published as a first author in a good journal, albeit in a different area from my PhD work. I'm currently preparing three articles that my supervisor and I expect to get published in Q1 journals of stats. However, I know this will take at least a year.\n\nSo, my first question is: should I consider switching to industry if I'm unable to secure a research position as a postdoc in any university due to no publication in the last three years? I'd prefer to stay in academia as I've got around five years of teaching stats courses to undergraduate and master's students, but my lack of research publications and experience is making it difficult for me to apply for a UK lecturer position. I'm also struggling to get a postdoc due to the lack of publications.\n\nDuring my job search, I've noticed that for a statistician or data scientist position, it's expected to have expertise in using Python, SQL, PowerBI, or Tableau. Unfortunately, I don't have any hands-on experience with these tools, and it'll take me a few months to learn them. I might skip Python for now since I'm familiar with R. Does this mean I won't be able to get a data scientist or statistician job in the industry anytime soon (say, in a couple of months)? Is this just my imposter syndrome talking, or is my judgement right?\n\nAnother question I have is that in industry, it's recommended to write a CV that's no more than two pages. However, I'm struggling to condense my CV, especially when it comes to the taught courses I've done. For example, courses like biostatistics, nonparametric methods, and design and analysis of experiments may not be relevant to the post I'm applying for in business industries. Should I remove them from my CV? But then I'll be missing out on some valuable information that could be advantageous for the job I'm applying for.\n\nLastly, can I add my PhD work and working papers as current projects in the \"working projects\" section of my CV? Can I also include some of the job-related final year projects I supervised as a lecturer in this section?\n\nI'm really at a crossroads right now, and I'm hoping to get some advice from this community. Thank you in advance for your help and suggestions!",

Following is the breakdown of events leading up to my current turmoil. \n\nMay 2022 - Initial draft of manuscript submitted to the principal supervisor\n\nDec 2022 - review by the principal supervisor. (The time taken to review honestly frustrated me but I did not make a fuss instead kept inquiring its status at least twice every four weeks) \n\nJan 2023 - the manuscript was revised as per the review and re-submitted to the principal supervisor\n\nJan 2023 - revisions requested again  by the principal supervisor \n\nFeb 2nd 2023 - the manuscript was revised as per the review and re-submitted to the principal supervisor. The manuscript was ready to be submitted and we decide on two journals (one was the first choice while the second was a safety net). The principal supervisor agreed to submit the manuscript to the journal within the next weekend. We mutually decided that further review is not needed because: the manuscript was a condensed version of my master's thesis which meant it underwent several rounds of review (5 reviews by 4 different people) prior to my thesis defense (Note: the reviewers present at the defense elaborated on how well-written and clear the thesis was). Furthermore, the manuscript was also revised twice by the principal supervisor. \n\nFeb 5th - So the weekend comes along and I contact him to find out if he has submitted the paper to the journal. He then informs me that he has sent the paper to review to two other co-authors (Note: I am the first author and I wasn't even CC'ed in these mails and thus did not have direct contact with the two co-authors)\n\nFeb 11th - First co-author sends me the manuscript with tracked changes, which was actually helpful.\n\nFeb 19th - I revised the manuscript and re-send it to the principal supervisor\n\nFeb 20th - Second co-author expresses his disinterest in the paper and says the statistical analysis needs to be redone. His request did not make sense to me, and the statistical methods we used were also corroborated by another research paper. This paper was written by my principal supervisor's previous student ( this student studied the epidemiology of infection A in the study population, while I studied infection B in the same study population). I brought up my concerns to my principal supervisor which were: that the request for re-doing statistical analysis seems baseless and that this has been taking way too long and it's unnecessary to be revising a manuscript so much prior to submission. My supervisor agreed to both of my concerns and agreed that the redoing of the statistical analysis seems baseless. Therefore, he promised to submit it to the journal on March 1st after reading the paper once more and editing sentence structures, grammar etc. \n\nMarch 1st (8a.m)- I send him a reminder to read through and submit the manuscript. He says he won't be able to do it (he wants reminders to be sent because he forgets things and does not keep a schedule/record of tasks/events). I was annoyed but decided to not be rude and politely request another date on which he would be able to read and submit the manuscript. He says he will let me know. I wait for several days. \n\nMarch 6th - I don't hear back from my principal supervisor, so I send him a text requesting a date he can set aside to read and submit the manuscript. \n\nMarch 7th - He texts me back saying he went through the manuscript on the night of March 6th and that he wants the statistical analysis re-done, the very same change that he deemed baseless on Feb 20th. \n\nExtra information: \n\n\\- My co-supervisor is useless, therefore, I can not expect any help from him. Even though he's my co-supervisor he doesn't even know me and has met me for a combined total of 30 mins for the entire two years of my project. \n\n\\- the second co-author who initially suggested that we need to re-do stats is an expert in that infection and is my principal supervisor's PhD supervisor.

I work in infectious diseases research in Sri Lanka. I have now moved away from my supervisor's lab and have been working a full-time roll elsewhere since Nov 2021. I get frustrated that my supervisor does not stick to his word. As I said I work elsewhere now, and I have very little time to be dedicating to this nonsense right now. At the same time I want my paper published. \n\nWhat would you suggest the best course of action is? I want this paper published but I genuinely don't see the need to redo statistical analysis again.",

        "text": "I’m not an academic myself so I’m looking for insight on what normal lab conditions/expectations are as I’m afraid my partner is being taken advantage of but I don’t want to overstep if I’m wrong. I know that it’s be best to consult the university or consulate regarding visas but I’m worried something not exactly legal is happening and I don’t want to unintentionally out my partner. \n\nMy partner is in a somewhat unique situations. For background - he is technically finishing his last year of undergrad in his country but is already working in a lab (neuroscience) and through connections from his current PI, he was hired by a lab in the US as a research assistant while he continues at his home university remotely to pursue his masters. He is currently in the US doing a temporary 2 month stay before returning to his country to graduate then coming back in the fall to start his masters and stay at the lab here for 2-3 years meaning that this could become a long term problem. \n\nThe concerning part is that he initially told me he’d be paid by the lab but at the last minute he said his visa didn’t work out as expected so he’s being paid through a (very minimal) grant from his home university instead. I think he’s actually here on a tourist visa now and he seems to be under the impression that it’s fine but I thought that a J1 visa is necessary in these circumstances. The conditions of the lab are also questionable. The PI said they’d be finding him an apartment starting from the fall but for now they’ve asked him to just sleep in the lab for 2 months because it was difficult to arrange an apartment for such a short stay. He also generally works 12+ hours (10am-12am; 10am-2am if he has a zoom meeting with his home uni lab) and I think literally living in the lab has completely obliterated any boundary he might have between work and his personal life. He told me they’re pushing to have him publish a paper by the fall already so the work is really piling up (he’s been here for about a month now). \n\nDoes any of this raise any red flags? I know that I may very well be overreacting but in a normal work environment I would be pretty taken aback by these conditions. I work at a university but I’m very far removed from the academics so I consulted with an experienced faculty that I trust and he seems to think this situation is not great but he also acknowledged that he’s in a completely different field and doesn’t know much about med research. I’m just worried as my partner is very determined and from a country where overwork is rampant so he’d honestly be a prime target for workplace abuse. Worst of all, if he is being taken advantage of then he has no legal recourse if his visa isn’t actually valid for the work he’s doing. I’d like to help/warm him if I can as he’s quite naive and will do anything for the sake of being able to do research despite it actually putting his future in jeopardy",

I’m sure I’m not unique in this. \n\nI’m pretty proud of my achievements, as I’m finishing a great engineering UG program with several grad school offers that suit me well. But I can’t stop but feel a little guilty or self indulgent for wanting a more academically oriented career. I’ve been told by people that I really trust that a PhD/academia seem like a great fit for me and I stand a good shot at ending up in some good places based on my progress and connections so far. There’s so much more I want to research, explore, and do, and being able to do that excites me. \n\nWhen engineering industry is right there, it just goes against my instincts to chase a less certain future in academia. I’m in the decision making process for grad school atm and this is just really weighing on me since I’m deciding between MS an PhD degrees. (There’s a very stable MS-&gt; industry pipeline in my field)\n\nWould appreciate any advice or perspectives on this. Does this resonate with anyone? How’d you get through it if so?",

I don't hate my job but I never felt fulfilled writing code. In my spare time, I would do some self-study with textbooks, but I always want to study fulltime again.

I don't know if it would be too unrealisitic, but my final goal would be entering a top university  PhD in pure math in the furture. So here are some of my questions:\n\n1. Should I apply for Master degree program or some non-degree program first to boost my GPA?\n\n2. If I am gonna apply for Master degree program, should I apply for Non-thesis or thesis based program if my final goal is PhD study?\n\n3. Any general suggesions or comments for my current situation?\n\nThank you so much for reading my messy words! I appreciate any advice or comments",

        "text": "Hello Fellow Academics,\n\nCurrently, I am a second year PhD student in a School of Public Health the US, and I am passionate about somatic cancer mutations and cancer epidemiology. I succeeded in joining a research lab in a Cancer Center that is affiliated with my university. My problem is that I can't work either as an intern or as a researcher in that Cancer Center, which is a very important step for me to access the data. \n\nI can't work as an intern except in the Summer, which is not a sufficient time for me to access the data. I can't work full time there because I am a fully funded international student on an F1 student visa, and working at the cancer center - although out of the question - would mean giving away my current funding, which is vital for me to support my stay in the US. I tried asking the School to (transfer) my funding to the Cancer Center, so that I keep getting my benefits through the Cancer Center, but that was not accepted because the Award that I got was the most prestigious for a graduate student, and the School can't just transfer it to the Cancer Center even if that cancer center was affiliated with the University.\n\nA few days ago, my advisor brought me some good news, that the School agreed to keep paying for my tuition and health insurance while I work part time at the cancer center. As for the monthly stipend, I was told to contact the cancer center to see if they would give me a paid part-time position instead of my current GA status in the School of public health. I tried doing that but my lab supervisor told me that the cancer center would not approve paid positions unless I had grant funding, which neither I nor she has at the moment. \n\nMy question is:\n\nHas any of you faced this problem before and managed to solve it successfully? To me, I am still passionate about my research goals, but with me reaching almost half the way through my PhD, I have to think about other sources of data or else find a \"doable\" research question for my dissertation and just my advisors to assign me to any professor who will help me through my dissertation. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "This is a really laughable issue but now I just need someone to say something and help me take the step I have to take.\n\nI am at the end of my PhD journey, currently revising my thesis draft. Meanwhile, I am also working as a sales associate at one of the biggest luxury brands in the world. Always have been since the start of my PhD.\n\nI don't have a full scholarship. But with the income from this job, I have never struggled too much financially. Although I don't have much savings, I have money for rent, food, holidays, and can even afford some finer clothes and cosmetics for myself. \n\nWorking in retail has never been my long-term career goal, though. When I ask myself, this has always been very clear. In fact, it's really really far away from what I really want to do...\n\nI started my PhD not too long before the pandemic, and my completion has already been delayed by covid. Now I finally finished the whole draft in a satisfying way, all my supervisors have suggested that I should stop working or at least work less, then focus all my time on making revisions to avoid any further delays to my completion. And I know they're right. I also want to finish this quickly, and start pursuing the career I really want. Meanwhile, retail jobs do have really long hours and you can't use any of that to work on thesis.\n\nI know my store doesn't hire part-time people so reducing my hour isn't an option. I also know that once I quit this retail job, I will not be able to get it back - it's retail, people come and go very fast and very easily. So my financial security, which I have been so comfortable about all the time, will be heavily jeopardised for the first time in a lot of years. In the current economic climate when everything is so expensive. It makes me really anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nI really want to know what I should do now and what is the best. Although this is definitely going to be a very laughable thing to many of you, I hope you can give some opinions and advice. Thanks",

Both of them didn't know the other before I contacted them.  \n\n\nThey helped refine my manuscript and submitted it to a decent IF 8.0 journal based on my field of study. It was editorially rejected.  \nWe improved it further and submitted to a 7.0 journal. Same results.  \n\n\nMy understanding is that there's a blind spot that all co-authors are missing and there's something lacking in either the work or the drafting of the manuscripts.  \n\n\nBut one of the editors called me out of nowhere today and said that the problem is with my name and nationality and it would be best to bring a reputable author in the field who is from a Western country and university. He said that that's how he'd started before he became reputable and that he wished he could change it.   \n\n\nI asked my co-authors for their opinions and they said that my name is a huge problem since I have the same name and nationality as the guy who did 9/11 (I hate my parents for not changing my name when I was 1 year old). My supervisor had the same remarks, \"Get a Western co-author if you want to get into these journals.  \n\n\nThese opinions feel very ... stupid to me, don't have a better way to put it. \n\nBut is it true? Idk I feel like I've wasted the last few years of my life working toward academia. If there really is racism and nationalism involved, I won't be pursuing a PhD.",

        "text": "I work full-time in a University neuroscience lab as a lab tech (graduated from this Uni nearly two years ago). I've acquired some unique skills that I believe most other applicants wouldn't have (notably, my primary role is to perform animal survival surgeries for the group: injections to various brain regions and optical fiber or GRIN lens implants.. will eventually be training new post-docs/students in these surgeries). However, I do not have any publications...and I fear that if I'm just training others to do their own surgeries that I won't have opportunities in the future to be included in publications (though in initial interview was told I would).\n\nWhere I really thrive is not necessarily in the hands-on work but in the discussion, the problem-solving, reading papers and critiquing methods... I don't mean to say that I'm at the level of a post-doc (I'm not). Rather, this is the way that I prefer to interact with the material...It is generally where I would impress professors back as an undergrad student (several professors voiced they were impressed by my questions, my discussion, my interest in the material during their office hours and in classes). However, there are few opportunities in this position to showcase my potential to handle the intellectual work, to consider a meaningful question, to design an experiment, to face problems, to write a coherent article.... I find as a Lab Tech, the expectation is that I simply \"do\" and let someone else do the thinking. I've certainly tried to join in during meetings, but I find the post-docs are irritated to hear from a mere lab tech...particularly if the PI agrees with something I've said or suggested. I don't know how the PI feels about me as they are very busy and I do not get to meet with them one-on-one. I've only been with this group for 5 months. They seem to have liked some of the input I've given during meetings though and asked that I help a grad student (to the student's irritation) in designing their experiment. Of course, I haven't been included in the design of this experiment... \n\nI've considered proposing to the PI that I take on a small project of my own, but have been advised in this subreddit that this is unlikely...\n\nI want to make it into a competitive, reputable program. What more do I need to be doing to improve my chances? The reputable program at my own University is purportedly only accepting 10 applicants this cycle and have turned down very qualified applicants with first authorship in Nature, etc. Should I just go with the flow in this lab and focus on extracurriculars? Should I volunteer part-time in yet another lab just for the opportunity to take on my own project? I am taking a grad-level course atm (for MS students) and plan to take a few more to show that I can handle the courses and to get recent LoRs. I feel like I can be doing more...",
