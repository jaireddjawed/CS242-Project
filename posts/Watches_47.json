        "text": "Occasionally, i have seen SNK photos posted here and I've always been intrigued by the ones on the bracelet for the SNK809K1. The last one i saw was on the green SNK and thought that looked great so i just had to get one for my cream SNK 803. \nThis is a watch i love. It's the first automatic in my collection and a bit of a strap monster. I brought it on a family holiday to the USA last year just with 5 straps and had a look for every occasion. I gotta say though, at 37mm the watch has always felt a bit petite on my wrist which is 7 and a quarter inch. The straps i have for it mostly taper which tends to diminish the wrist presence further. That's one thing I'm immediately pleased with on this bracelet is that there's no taper so it wears really nicely and beefs up the presence a little bit.\n\nAs for the quality, it is very jingly jangly, hollow end links, folded links, basic clasp.. I knew all of this in advance but i still love it. The clasp has the Seiko with the 5 shield stamped on it which is pretty nice.\n\nAs for the vendor horologeband.com i do not recommend them. They printed the address wrong on my package leading to a protracted back and forth and i got lucky that my postal service looked up to postcode, they usually don't!\n\nOn receipt, one of the end links was a bit squashed giving me an extra job to fix and they didn't even ship spring bars or a tool with it. This after i paid €28.50 plus delivery. Disappointing seeing as you get those things with a 5 bucks AliExpress strap. \n\nAnyway, I'm determined to enjoy this thing and i hope you like it.",

He's a farmer, but likes to dress neatly outside of work and so I wanted something practical that would fit a dress shirt and dress shoes sort of look. I know a LITTLE bit about watches so I looked at the Seiko, Orient and Citizen collections and I found the CB0260-81L, which is solar charged and radio controlled. It also gets a hardened case and sapphire glass which seem like really nice features.\n\nHowever before I pull the trigger and since father's day is still a few months out I figured I'd check for advice on this sub. Do you agree this is a good choice for a man that might only wear it once a week? And are there other watches I should be considering? \n\nThank you for your consideration.",

        "text": "Seems an appropriate choice for today, I’ve had this watch for a few months and haven’t really felt the love, until now. I’ve never had it on the bracelet as it’s been on an Uncle Seiko rubber strap until I paired it with this Grey Nato for the trip.\n\nJapan seems to have a quite big watch culture, most men seem to be wearing one rather than the standard issue Apple Watch you see everywhere. They tend to favour oversized metal bracelet watches. I’ve seen mainly Seiko/Citizen and the odd Cartier funnily enough.\n\nIn Tokyo I plan to head to some of the used watch shops where apparently you can get almost anything, purely for window shopping as my collection is complete bar my grail (which I refuse to pay anything other than the RRP so the wait goes on).\n\nMy other Japanese watch I have with me is the JDM (Japanese domestic market) the classic G-Shock Square, GW5000U1. It looks similar to the standard squares but with better quality materials/strap and a subtle toned down grey face. I’ve bought and sold a few G-Shocks but this one is a keeper, I can’t see me not having it in my collection.\n\nAnyway Japan is a wonderful place to visit, I highly recommend it. It’s clean, safe, people are respectful and friendly… and they know how to party too! Fascinating country and culture.",
