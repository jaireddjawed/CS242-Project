I wanted to know if the community is interested in tutorials, coding, scripts that link Space Science with Python. Python is an amazing programming language and I use it for my academic work as a guest scientist, as well as in industry (my current \"main job\").\n\nAstronomy and Space Science are ... I'd say \"beloved\" science domains. One does not need to be a scientist to enjoy beautiful images from JWST or spacecraft missions.\n\nBut what about the enthusiastic and skilled free-time coders and Open Source folks? Approaching astronomy and space topics from a coding domain is difficult without prior knowledge or experience.\n\nAny that's where I try to \"fill the gap\", and where I asked around in this post: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/g4bg9f\/space\\_science\\_with\\_python\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/g4bg9f\/space_science_with_python\/)\n\nIndeed I did some stuff in the last couple of years, months and weeks. I did not want to spam the r\/Physics community (I engaged more with the Python community). But still: you guys gave me the best and frequent feedback and I want to share with you my journey so far. Again: thanks again for all the contributions!\n\nOne of my recent projects is a 16-parts tutorial on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). Quick intro: NEOs are objects that approach the Sun within a distance of max. 1.3 AU. 1.0 AU corresponds to the average distance between Earth and Sun (around 150 Million km). And in this series I try to answer questions like:\n\n*How many objects are out there? Where are they and how do they \"travel\" around the Sun? Are they bright? If yes, how bright? How can we compute their brightness? Can we also model a theoretical distribution of NEOs to get an understanding where we have \"to look at\"? And what kind of telescopes are needed?*\n\nSpace Science is approachable; and there are tons of libraries and Open Access data for Python. I try to gather my academic knowledge and create these tutorials to support students, free-time coders and everyone, who is into Python and astronomy. If you have ideas, feedback, please let me know.\n\nIf hope this is not too off-topic!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nThomas\n\n[GitHub Link](https:\/\/github.com\/ThomasAlbin\/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials\/tree\/main\/%5BProject%5D-Near-Earth-Objects)\n\n[YouTube Playlist](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tVyFqVuuM6g&list=PLNvIBWkEdZ2hL5be8mQdpTU3BjhKIhD6L)","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678560095.0},{"title":"Another research group only finds 70K superconducting transition temperature at significantly higher pressures in Lutetium Hydride, contrary to recent nature study by Dias grouo","author":"CMScientist","url":"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2303.05117","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678459041.0},{"title":"r\/physics helps to catch manipulated data","author":"Rococo_Relleno","url":"https:\/\/physics.aps.org\/articles\/v16\/40#c8","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678422131.0},{"title":"Where do physicists discuss recently published work or work in progress?","author":"dargscisyhp","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/11nsn5f\/where_do_physicists_discuss_recently_published\/","text":"Is there a forum or other medium where physicists publicly discuss recently published work or work in progress?

I\u2019m currently a late second year bachelor\u2019s of physics student in Europe, approaching my third and final year of my undergraduate studies. I have thought and reflected a lot as to what I would like to do after my undergraduate studies in terms of career as well as lifestyle choices. Though I enjoy my classes and have done a fair amount of projects at my university, I am becoming increasingly aware of the competition and sacrifices that are needed to be made if one wants to land something like a tenure position at a university.\n\nTo give some more context, I am primarily interested in astrophysics. For every course in maths method, data analysis or theory that I followed, it all became more intriguing once I find a link of it to the space sciences. A project I have done for some time was also the analyzing of open source data for gravitational wave events. Which made me learn quite a bit on signal filtering and GR (though the tensor calc and GR was for my own personal curiosity). I am currently self-teaching myself QM in the hopes to one day tackle something like QFT (as it\u2019s an intriguing subject. Though I definitely do not want to do HEP theory\/experiment, it is mainly for curiosity) & understand more about quantum computing (as I did notice that this area is getting more funding and industry interest. And I barely know a thing about it unfortunately).\nOne of the projects I did recently was on radio astronomy. Trying to create a very small radio telescope using a simple setup with TV dongles. I enjoyed it quite a bit. And after reading on the subject and contacting people in the field, it started to seem even more intriguing. I wanted to ask if any of you out there are pursuing the field of radio astronomy. If so, what was your experience like? What topics did you need to get a grasp on to better understand aperture synthesis? And do you think that the field has transferable skills (besides the data science ones)? I have a similar question to anyone else reading this. Using your respective fields of course. \n\nAs I am at a point where even though I know I am going to do at least my master\u2019s, I want to be more realistic with my prospects. As I am from a minority group that came to Europe to study, and I notice day by day that I am competing with people that are way more clever than me (imposter syndrome doesn\u2019t help here either) or sometimes way more fortunate in their network (whether they know this or not. As they have parents and\/or family friends who are in academia. Or had opportunities in high school that I could only dream of). This is something I cannot ignore. It is one of the reasons I decided that theory definitely won\u2019t be something for me. Besides the bit stated on people much clever than me (and it objectively shows so if I were to compare GPAs. I\u2019m in a place of 7.0\/10 to 7.3\/10, working on raising it ofc. While some of these people have 8.0\/10 as a bare minimum), though I like theory, I can always pick up a book and teach myself any new physics or maths. But papers and articles in my fields of interest seem repetitive and stagnant. Just add a new term to the scalar field so that it still fits our inflationary model, or let\u2019s invent this new metric for black holes without proposing some observables.

LIGO's ability to detect gravitational waves (GWs) from astrophysical sources, such as binary black hole mergers, also provides the potential to detect extraterrestrial mega-technology, such as Rapid and\/or Massive Accelerating spacecraft (RAMAcraft). We show that LIGO is sensitive to RAMAcraft of 1 Jupiter mass accelerating to a fraction of the speed of light (e.g. 30\\%) from\u00a010\u2212100kpc or a Moon mass from\u00a01\u221210pc. While existing SETI searches can probe on the order of ten-thousand stars for human-scale technology (e.g. radio waves), LIGO can probe all 1011\u00a0stars in the Milky Way for RAMAcraft. Moreover, thanks to the\u00a0f\u22121\u00a0scaling of RAMAcraft signals, our sensitivity to these objects will increase as low-frequency detectors are developed and improved, allowing for the detection of smaller masses further from Earth. In particular, we find that DECIGO and the Big Bang Observer (BBO) will be about 100 times more sensitive than LIGO, increasing the search volume by 106, while LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) may improve sensitivities to objects with long acceleration periods. In this paper, we calculate the waveforms for linearly-accelerating RAMAcraft in a form suitable for LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA searches and provide the range for a variety of masses and accelerations. We expect that the current and upcoming GW detectors will soon become an excellent complement to the existing SETI efforts.\n\nComments:20 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcomeSubjects:Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)Cite as:arXiv:2212.02065\u00a0[astro-ph.IM]\u00a0(or\u00a0arXiv:2212.02065v2\u00a0[astro-ph.IM]\u00a0for this version)\u00a0https:\/\/doi.org\/10.48550\/arXiv.2212.02065","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675057748.0},{"title":"Photographs of Comet ZTF show an ephemeral tail pointing toward the Sun \u2014 this \u2018anti-tail\u2019 is an optical illusion seen when Earth crosses a comet's orbital plane","author":"marketrent","url":"https:\/\/www.spaceweather.com\/archive.php?view=1&day=22&month=01&year=2023","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1675060291.0},{"title":"Logic behind taking the coefficient of drag of lift and drags as constant","author":"adi0428","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/10njpds","text":"I recently came across a video about modelling the flight of a glider that uses coupled differential equations to solve for the v(t) and the theta(t)\nThe equations were the ones given below and they were solved using Wolfram mathematica to obtain the graphs\n\nThe doubt i have is that he has taken cL and cD to be constant when they are functions of the angle of attack of the plane.

Keller is typically seen as a sociologist or historian of science (she wrote *A Feeling for the Organism,* a biography on Barbara McClintock the discoverer of transposons), but she had science experiences of her own. \n\nQuote from essay on how foundational questions were undervalued in comparison to more calculation-oriented investigated\n\n>I went to graduate school with a vision of theoretical physics as a vehicle for the deepest inquiry into nature\u2014a vision perhaps best personified, in recent times, by Einstein. The use of mathematics to further one\u2019s understanding of the nature of space, time, and matter represented a pinnacle of human endeavor. I went to graduate school to learn about foundations. I was taught, instead, how to do physics. In place of wisdom, I was offered skills. Furthermore, this substitution was made with moralistic fervor. It was wrong, foolhardy, indeed foolish, to squander precious time asking why. Proper humility was to bend to the grindstone and learn techniques. Contemporary physics, under the sway of operationalism, had, it seemed, dispensed with the tradition of Einstein\u2014almost, indeed, with Einstein himself. General relativity, the most intellectually ambitious venture of the century, seemed then (wrongly) a dead subject. Philosophical considerations of any sort in the physical sciences were at an all-time low. Instead, techniques designed to calculate nth-order corrections to a theory grievously flawed at its base were the order of the day.\n\nand on calculation mistakes, deeper questions, and humility\n\n>I needed to be humbled. Though I writhed over the banality of the assignments I was given, I did them, acknowledging that I needed in any case to learn the skills. I made frequent arithmetic errors\u2014reflecting a tension that endures within me even today between the expansiveness of conception and the precision of execution, my personal variation perhaps of the more general polar tension in physics as a whole. When my papers were returned with the accuracy of the conception ignored and the arithmetic errors streaked with red\u2014as if with a vengeance\u2014I wondered whether I was studying physics or plumbing. Who has not experienced such a wrenching conflict between idealism and reality? Yet my fellow students seemed oddly untroubled. From the nature of their responses when I tried to press them for deeper understanding of the subject, I thought perhaps I had come from Mars. Why, they wondered, did I want to know? That they were evidently content with the operational success of the formulas mystified me. Even more mystifying was the absence of any appearance of the humility of demeanor that one would expect to accompany the acceptance of more limited goals. I didn\u2019t fully understand then that in addition to the techniques of physics, they were also studying the techniques of arrogance. This peculiar inversion in the meaning of humility was simply part of the process of learning how to be a physicist. It was intrinsic to the professionalization, and what I might even call the masculinization, of an intellectual discipline.\n\nEntire essay is quite interesting and would likely resonate with many who have studied theoretical physics.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1674594285.0},{"title":"In 1971, three cosmonauts Dobrovolski, Volkov, and Patsayev passed away due to a valve malfunction.

My subject was related to LHC and, more precisely, to the ATLAS experiment. It was one of the best periods to work on this experiment: LHC working efficiently, a lot of new data from ATLAS to analyse, Higgs boson discovery followed by the Nobel prize. However, after ten years, I can finally say it was the wrong choice to become a good physicist. \"What is a good physicist anyway?\" you would reply. To explain it, I'll say what I've learned and what I wish I had known.\n\n\\- Technical skills. I was on the experimental side. It means my job was to have a question about the detector or the physic and answer it with the data from the experiment. To do so, I had to use programming languages (c++, python) and many standard dev tools like IDE, VCS, and Linux OS. Also, it was data analysis, so a lot of statistics and a bit of machine learning were involved. Today we would say data science, but this term was not yet fashionable. Thanks to this experience, I was a complete developer while I didn't study IT.\n\n\\- Teamwork. ATLAS was something big. More than one thousand physicists at the time. So you had to work in a team. You had to meet your colleagues daily, synchronize the work, present and defend team results, and write papers together. I never was alone working. It has prepared me for remote work since most of my colleagues were from different countries.\n\n\\- Communication skills. Again, daily meetings and presentations with the team have taught me to communicate clearly. Writing papers and reports, teaching students, vulgarisation, and pedagogical presentation are other aspects that make you a great communicator.\n\n\\- Management, or being managed. My PhD advisor was directing and work\/results oriented. It means that the how and the why were not so essential, but the results were. I had a weekly meeting with him so he could review my work. He told me if I was doing well or not. He put pressure on me to accelerate or reprioritize things.\n\nOk, I'll stop there. Not bad, right? These are all critical skills for working in any company. I am very comfortable now in most work environments. I have an outstanding job with a good salary. It is a bright side of my life.\n\nSo why, ten years after, do I come to Reddit and complain? Because I always had fuckin' love physics. It is a reason I love life. I think the human species have to understand nature by modeling it. Nature encompasses humanity, and the only fact that society can understand it is a gift. Moreover, human understanding is progressing with each generation, so it is not only a succession of individual contributions but a human achievement. From a human perspective, the History of physics is fascinating. Most of the physicists that have impacted their field had a life that was very inspiring for me. By 17, I read Einstein's biography. So I decided to learn physics. The idea, the methods, and the creativity were what exciting me. It is a way of life.\n\nI'd like to have learned how to properly ask questions about nature and how to formulate them in a precise way. To be not too ambitious but still have exciting questions. To know the concepts to play with them, model or define them formally to construct a good model. More generally, I'd like to learn to start by having a good question rather than a good solution that needed a question. I d like to have learned to build a solution to a particular problem, and to construct it step by step. I also want to find an existing solution by doing a proper bibliography or assisting at conferences. I'd like to learn how to compare answers to problems and identify the best one. All of this is in the context of particle physics.

Greg received his bachelors in mathematics from Harvard University in 2018 and while there won the Hoopes prize for best undergraduate thesis. He also received an Honorable Mention for the Morgan Prize for Outstanding Research in Mathematics by an Undergraduate Student in 2018 and was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians in 2019.\n\nIn this episode, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name \"Tensor Programs\" and currently spans five highly technical papers. The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit. This occurs most famously in the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which then play a fundamental role in the branch of mathematics known as Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We review this foundational material and then show how Tensor Programs (TP) generalizes this classical work, offering new proofs of RMT. We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks.\n\nNote: Random Matrix Theory has its origins in atomic physics. They were introduced by Wigner as a way of circumventing the specifics of a complicated Hamiltonian: can one instead get an understanding of the spectrum by instead considering a random Hermitian operator?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/immtamr613aa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d768b38db9d77fda2ff29c765648cda4caabec2\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rth96qh813aa1.png?width=3325&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=165cfb059ef83afb51b29937778aaf87e607ecbe\n\nYoutube: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/1aXOXHA7Jcw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1aXOXHA7Jcw)\n\nApple Podcasts: [https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-cartesian-cafe\/id1637353704](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-cartesian-cafe\/id1637353704)\n\nSpotify: [https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1X5asAByNhNr996ZsGGICG](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1X5asAByNhNr996ZsGGICG)\n\nRSS: [https:\/\/feed.podbean.com\/cartesiancafe\/feed.xml](https:\/\/feed.podbean.com\/cartesiancafe\/feed.xml)","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1672862421.0},{"title":"Advanced LED technology: Directional high-efficiency nanowire LEDs with reduced angular color shift for AR and VR displays","author":"Badatu","url":"https:\/\/www.oejournal.org\/article\/doi\/10.29026\/oes.2022.220021","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672752238.0},{"title":"We could get messages back from spacecraft sent through a wormhole - A simulation of these theoretical cosmic tunnels reveals wormholes don\u2019t snap shut instantly","author":"Galileos_grandson","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/get-messages-sent-through-wormhole-relativity","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1672760500.0},{"title":"Nuclear fusion achieved at LLANL","author":"pruntidjuu","url":"https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/articles\/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1672714378.0},{"title":"Physics Questions - Weekly Discussion Thread - January 03, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/1028ygb\/physics_questions_weekly_discussion_thread\/","text":"This thread is a dedicated thread for you to ask and answer questions about concepts in physics.\n\nHomework problems or specific calculations may be removed by the moderators.

We find that any two distance moduli measurements for the same galaxy differ from each other by 2.07 times the reported one sigma uncertainty on average.\n2. This average difference between distance moduli measurements of the same galaxy as a multiple of reported uncertainty is growing with time of publication, rising to 3.00 times the reported one sigma uncertainty for all distances reported from 2014 to 2018.\n3. This average difference between distance moduli measurements of the same galaxy as a multiple of reported one sigma uncertainty is highest for the standard candles (3.01) including Cepheids (4.26), Type Ia Supernovae (2.85), and Tip of the Red Giant Branch (2.82).\n4. This data points to a possible systematic underestimation of uncertainties in extragalactic distances.\n5.

He concludes that the Newtonian system is mathematically \u201cincomplete\u201d in the sense that it does not include its limits (Here, the limit as the time delta between the hits goes to zero).\n\n[Balls have unequal mass](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yk5c4jnn544a1.png?width=213&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=393a9914ae287f90080579f78d8db16c607e43c8)\n\n*Details:*\n\nI\u2019m interested in the mathematical properties of Newtonian physics and yesterday found this paper by Prof. Edward A. Lee of U. of California, Berkeley.\n\n[Fundamental Limits of Cyber-Physical Systems Modeling](https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1145\/2912149), November 2016, ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems 1(1):1-26 DOI:10.1145\/2912149 [PDF](https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1145\/2912149)\n\nHe gives the example above in section 4, on page 17. I worked it out with his suggested masses of 1\/5, 1, and 5 and before velocities 1, 0, -1 and, as he said, got different sets of after velocities. Specifically, I used my [simple physics engine](https:\/\/github.com\/CarlKCarlK\/perfect-physics\/blob\/main\/part_5_plato_and_the_Nerd.ipynb) and got  <-73\/27, -40\/27, -5\/9> vs <-31\/9, -7\/9, -2\/3>.\n\nHe closes the paper with a discussion of issues such as interleaving, real-world behavior, and determinism. If interested, please see the paper (starting near page 18) for more details.\n\nI personally love this example. I find it much more compelling than other similar attempts to understand the mathematical structure of Newtonian physics (e.g. Norton\u2019s dome, Suppes\u2019 2D symmetric 3-particle collision, and various 2D \u201cgame engine\u201d collisions.)\n\nMeta:\n\nIf there is a discussion on this, please keep it very civil.

Kessler in which the volume of space debris in low-Earth orbit would be so high that objects in orbit would be frequently impacted by the debris, thus creating even more garbage and a greater risk of other impacts on other objects. As the number of orbiting satellites grows and old satellites accumulate, the risk of this Kessler cascading collision scenario becomes greater.\n\n \n\n[ Graphic representation of what could happen ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3kekvxkxml0a1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b5e4bccb44697f8e4e91c71f782399838692e23)\n\n \n\n**What happens when a satellite stops working or is no longer needed?** They do not return to Earth alone or disappear in any way. When a satellite breaks, no one goes into space to fix it. They all stay there, they stay in their orbit, moving at incredible speeds. It's hard looking up at the sky to think of anything that might hinder space exploration, but those dead satellites, paint smears, fragments of solar panels, or rockets from old missions can pose a threat.\n\nAll that space junk is moving at speeds of up to 27,000 km per hour and each object varies in direction as it is affected by Earth's gravitational field. Avoiding collisions through evasive maneuvers consumes the satellite's fuel and time, making it a less efficient instrument than it should be. Then there's the fact that most orbiting objects can't be controlled from Earth, so there's no way to interfere with debris on a collision course.\n\nThe danger posed by even a small fragment traveling at high speeds is easy to see. As calculated by NASA, **a 1-centimeter \"paint blob\" traveling at 10 km\/s can cause the same damage as a 250-kilogram object moving at about 100 km\/hour on Earth.** If we increase the size of the fragment to 10 centimeters, such a projectile would have the force of 7 kilograms of TNT. If we imagine thousands of objects of this type flying at dizzying speeds and colliding with each other... the landscape is truly a nightmare.\n\nFor this reason, the European Space Agency (ESA) has announced a plan to tackle this growing problem through the Clearspace-1 mission, led by a Swiss startup called Clearspace in consortium with ESA.\n\n**ClearSpace-1's primary target will be a piece of junk called Vespa,** which was dropped into orbit about 800 km above Earth by ESA's Vega launcher in 2013. It is the size of a small satellite and weighs 100 kilos. Due to its simple shape and robust construction, it is a very suitable piece for space testing. **It is a relatively light lens and easy to capture.** And it is unlikely that when the spacecraft picks it up, it will fragment. Vespa will be \"hunted\" with four robotic arms that, once in his possession, will drag him out of Earth's orbit, with which the end of both will end up burning in the atmosphere.\n\nSince this is a suicide mission for the robot, the ideal, if all goes as planned, will be **to create a permanent cleaning robot that can expel space debris into the atmosphere without having to detach from the ship itself with each cleaning operation**. It is not profitable, of course. But right **now it is necessary to demonstrate if the concept works.**","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1668729252.0},{"title":"Computer Helps Prove Long-Sought Fluid Equation Singularity | Quanta Magazine","author":"carbonqubit","url":"https:\/\/www.quantamagazine.org\/computer-helps-prove-long-sought-fluid-equation-singularity-20221116\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1668639038.0},{"title":"Visualizing cell structure: 3D imaging lipidometry in single cell by in-flow holographic tomography","author":"Badatu","url":"https:\/\/www.oejournal.org\/article\/doi\/10.29026\/oea.2023.220048","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1668692630.0},{"title":"Careers\/Education Questions - Weekly Discussion Thread - November 17, 2022","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/yxr2vc\/careerseducation_questions_weekly_discussion\/","text":"This is a dedicated thread for you to seek and provide advice concerning education and careers in physics.\n\nIf you need to make an important decision regarding your future, or want to know what your options are, please feel welcome to post a comment below.\n\nA few years ago we held a graduate student panel, where many recently accepted grad students answered questions about the application process.

In OPM, a de-magnifying optical system consisting of a tube lens (TL2) and a secondary objective lens (O2) is used to produce an intermediate image plane. TL1 and TL2 can be set up to form a relay pair. O1 & O2 make a 4f system. In order to have an aberration-free intermediate image at the front focal space of the O2, the back focal planes (BFP) of both objective lenses should be conjugated. \n\nTo verify this conjugation, the \"beam wobble\" method was suggested by Sapoznik et al. By sending a sinusoidal signal to the galvo and adjusting the axial position of the objective lens until the outcoming beam in the front focal space of O1 is stationary. When both objective lenses are conjugated to the galvo, they're conjugated to each other. See appendix 4 in \\[1\\] for detailed information on the method. \n\nIn the DaXi paper, Yang et al, use the same approach to conjugate the galvo to the BFP of the O1. After having this conjugation, they try to image a calibration grid onto the camera using a white light source. For the next step, they suggest \"moving O3 200 \u03bcm away\/closer to O2, then measuring the magnification of the system with the grid. The goal is to have the same magnification regardless of the relative position of O3 to O2. Move O2 and O3 together axially until at one point the magnification is uniform. The pupil plane of O2 is then conjugate to that of O1\" \\[2\\]. See Supplementary information\/Supplementary Note 2\/ Detailed alignment procedure\/ in \\[2\\]. \n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Does this method work for a Scandreas-based OPM? \n2. Among these two procedures, which one do you recommend? \n3. How do you make sure of the conjugation without having a galvo? \n4. Can someone follow the procedure explained in \\[2\\] directly for the tilted version? \n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Most of the physics that went into this I had done by August 2020 but we have spent the last two and a bit years in referee hell. I think 8 different referees have commented on different versions with comments ranging from \"groundbreaking\" to those insulting our intelligence. This was originally meant to be a two part paper but we were told to condense into one so there's a lot in my thesis that didn't make it in. To be fair to PRE the editors were very patient and obviously keen to try and get this published.\n\nDuring this relentless referee process (not helped by the pandemic situation) I lost faith in my ability as a researcher, seriously considered dropping out and was frankly depressed. I wanted to remind those of us starting out in academia that research is hard. Not just the actual research but the peer review process can be even more challenging. It's easy to read other people's papers and think you're nowhere near clever enough to write something like that, but you have no idea the journey that paper went through. \n\nSo what's this paper about? The basic idea is that we develop a way to compute the average position (and variance) of a particle evolving in a thermal system without having to resort to numerical simulations. It's a proof of concept in a toy model but it demonstrates that the Renormalization Group can be used in a very different way to how it is usually applied. Figure 10 for example shows how a particle evolving in an unequal double well potential comprised of two Lennard-Jones potentials next to each other is very accurately described by our method. The long term goal would be to use this technique to describe the long-time behaviour of thermal systems that cannot be simulated using current computational constraints.

Rev. E, we focus on the role of an impurity in quantum Otto and Carnot heat cycles. Research in quantum thermodynamics mainly concentrates on calculating the work outputs and efficiencies for different quantum cycles. However, analyzing the effects of impurity on such systems has been missing. We introduced an impurity into the system and used the laws of quantum thermodynamics to probe its impact. We could find different operational phases while tuning possible system parameters. The device was found to work as a heat engine, cold pump, and refrigerator in different parameter regimes. Remarkably we also noticed an enhancement of the work output in the quantum heat engine phase.\n\nThe significance of our work is that one could switch between different operational modes by tuning the system parameters, thus creating a multipurpose device.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1667572314.0},{"title":"Do any of you ever get all giddy after inferring physics knowledge?","author":"CaspianSeaDragon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/ylfoyl\/do_any_of_you_ever_get_all_giddy_after_inferring\/","text":"I recently tried to look for an equation that describes the angle between two bodies in orbit before being able to perform a Hohmann transfer (phase angle, for sending probes to other planets or making a rendezvous with the ISS). I wasn't really sure what to look for and Google was doing it's usual unhelpful \"what is an orbit?\" When you ask it some deep end physics question. So I decided to apply the orbital period equation and use that to figure out how to time a burn so that two orbiting spacecraft meet.\n\nAnd sure enough, I did. I got A = 180(1-(r1+r2\/2r2)^3\/2), although I prefer to write it as A = 180 - (r1+r2\/ct\u2022r2)^3\/2 where ct = 2(180^-2\/3) which is a constant, and A is the phase angle. I tested it on Kerbal Space Program for each transfer window and got it almost bang on everytime. I also compared it to real interplanetary transfer windows and I got it correct as well.

I have found this very old Millikan Apparatus set up at the lab I work at. This thing seems to be straight out of the 80s and it looks like the company that made it no longer exists. Additionally the design of the experiment seems a bit archaic. I got it to work, however and everything seems to be functioning fine. Only problem is, it is damn near impossible to keep track of particles accurately while being awkwardly hunched over the thing. I was wondering if there were any CCD microscope cameras anyone knows of that could be mounted on the lens. I am not even sure if this would be at all viable since there isn't a lot of light coming through the lens and the particles themselves are only a micron in diameter (Even though the original experiment was done using oil droplets that had been passed through ionized air, I think most modern setups for college purposes use latex microbead solutions). An additional challenge is that I can not, for the life of me figure out who made this lens. it has a 22.4 mm diameter (casing included) and no branding or model number to demarcate it, what so ever.\n\nAdditionally if anyone has any other ideas on how I can make it easier on the students to keep track of the particles, I would be glad to hear it. I know that more modern Millikan experiment  apparatuses for college use come with built in CCD cameras and are generally more ergonomical.

We've had one of those \"Laser Maze\" things with the rockets for ages, and I guess he got it out and started playing with it again, and got interested in what exactly is happening. While we were walking the dog he asked me to buy him \"one of those cat lasers \\[laser pointer\\] so I can look at how glass makes it refract\". Then thought about it a bit more and asked for safety goggles too as he doesn't know where the light will go. Plus wanting to know if he used a laser to draw things on the moon if an astronaut could see it etc. All that stuff you get excited to hear as a parent.\n\nHis birthday is coming up, and I'd like to get him some sort of optics kit (I had a chemistry set as a kid, like that but for optics) that is open-ended. Not just a couple of basic experiments and then you're done, but something that if he gets into it long term could be extended with standard parts. I'm imaging starting with experimenting with the basics (simple lens shapes etc), and then go from there to ??? Maybe some spectroscopy? Polarization? Prisms? Interference? Something like holography or the double-slit experiment would blow his mind. What else would be good?\n\nHaving said that, I also don't want to be that parent that spends big $$$ and then is tempted to push the kid beyond their interest level and ends up turning them off.\n\nSo, where would r\/Physics suggest starting with this? I have a biomed PhD and am comfortable with basic concepts via microscopy \/ confocal \/ etc, but haven't touched physics directly in ages. Also he is 11, so built-in safety is obviously more of an issue than it is with an adult. Ideally he'd be able to use most\/all of it independently when he felt like it, rather than having to wait for someone to supervise him.\n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1666222543.0},{"title":"Ultra-precise quantum thermometer to measure the temperatures of space and time","author":"fiziks4fun","url":"https:\/\/www.adelaide.edu.au\/newsroom\/news\/list\/2022\/10\/17\/ultra-precise-quantum-thermometer-to-measure-the-temperatures-of-space-and","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1666193736.0},{"title":"I made a list of physics YouTube channels.","author":"iboughtarock","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/y6uzbx\/i_made_a_list_of_physics_youtube_channels\/","text":"The full list with a table of contents is [available on GitHub.](https:\/\/github.com\/PrejudiceNeutrino\/YouTube_Channels)\n\n## Physics:\n\n* [Minutephysics](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/minutephysics\/videos)\n* [PBS Space Time](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/pbsspacetime\/videos)\n* [The Science Asylum](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/TheScienceAsylum\/videos)\n* [Physics with Elliot](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/PhysicswithElliot\/videos)\n* [Physics Girl](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/physicsgirl\/videos)\n* [Fermilab](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/fermilab\/videos)\n* [Physics Videos by Eugene](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/EugeneKhutoryansky\/videos)\n* [ScienceClic English](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ScienceClicEN\/videos)\n* [Xenosum](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/XenosumPhysics\/videos)\n* [DrPhysicsA](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/DrPhysicsA\/videos)\n* [For the Allure of Physics](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCliSRiiRVQuDfgxI_QN_Fmw\/videos)\n* [ViaScience](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/viascience\/playlists?view=1&sort=dd&shelf_id=0) \\- quantum mechanics, thermodynamics\n* [XylyXylyX](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/XylyXylyX\/playlists) \\- general relativity\n* [Sixty Symbols](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/sixtysymbols\/videos)\n* [PhysicsHigh](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/PhysicsHigh\/videos)\n* [Parth G](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ParthGChannel\/videos)\n* [Looking Glass Universe](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/LookingGlassUniverse\/videos)\n* [Arvin Ash](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ArvinAsh\/videos)\n* [Physics Explained](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/PhysicsExplainedVideos\/videos)\n* [The Biggest Ideas in the Universe](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrxfgDEc2NxZJcWcrxH3jyjUUrJlnoyzX) \\- playlist\n* [Eigenchris](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/eigenchris\/playlists) \\- relativity, tensors\n* [Flipping Physics](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/Flippingphysics2013\/videos)\n* [Physics Explained](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/PhysicsExplained3\/playlists)\n* [Professor M does Science](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ProfessorMdoesScience\/videos)\n\n## Math:\n\n* [3Blue1Brown](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw\/videos)\n* [Numberphile](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/numberphile\/videos)\n* [PBS Infinite Series](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/pbsinfiniteseries\/videos)\n* [Eddie Woo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/misterwootube\/videos)\n* [Vihart](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Vihart\/videos)\n* [Stand-up Maths](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/standupmaths\/videos)\n* [Mathologer](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/Mathologer\/videos)\n* [patrickJMT](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/patrickJMT\/videos)\n* [Tipping Point Math](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/TippingPointMath\/videos)\n* [Think Twice](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ThinkTwiceLtu\/videos)\n* [blackpenredpen](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/blackpenredpen\/videos)\n* [MindYourDecisions](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/MindYourDecisions\/videos)\n* [Richard E.

Only issue is that the physics for the company tech (room-temperature superconductors) \"isn't fully understood yet\". I put quotes around that because it's a sort of colloquial for \"it's not ready for market consumption\".\n\nAs far as I'm aware, there are researchers that are seeking funding all of the time.

Money gets distributed to researchers with the best proposals.\n\nDo either of these bullet points accurately describe the situation? Or is it a mix of both?

The emergent radial direction of the bulk is identified with the depth of the layers, and the network itself is interpreted as a bulk geometry. Our network provides a data-driven holographic modeling of strongly coupled systems. With a scalar \u03d54 theory with unknown mass and coupling, in unknown curved spacetime with a black hole horizon, we demonstrate our deep learning (DL) framework can determine them which fit given response data. First, we show that, from boundary data generated by the AdS Schwarzschild spacetime, our network can reproduce the metric. Second, we demonstrate that our network with experimental data as an input can determine the bulk metric, the mass and the quadratic coupling of the holographic model. As an example we use the experimental data of magnetic response of a strongly correlated material Sm0.6Sr0.4MnO3. This AdS\/DL correspondence not only enables gravity modeling of strongly correlated systems, but also sheds light on a hidden mechanism of the emerging space in both AdS and DL.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1665237553.0},{"title":"AI reduces a 100,000-equation quantum physics problem to only four equations","author":"phaitonican","url":"https:\/\/spacepub.org\/news\/ai-reduces-a-100000equation-quantum-physics-problem-to-only-four-equations","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1665144723.0},{"title":"The Universe Is Not Locally Real, and here\u2019s how the Physics Nobel Prize Winners Proved It","author":"0ddCafe","url":"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1665179410.0},{"title":"Is Szilard Engine Really Broken?","author":"erpsrinivas","url":"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2111.12300","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1665163933.0},{"title":"Optical study: A review and a statistical analysis of porosity in metals additively manufactured by laser powder bed fusion","author":"Badatu","url":"https:\/\/www.oejournal.org\/article\/doi\/10.29026\/oea.2022.210058","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1665146066.0},{"title":"Textbooks & Resources - Weekly Discussion Thread - October 07, 2022","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/xxyj32\/textbooks_resources_weekly_discussion_thread\/","text":"This is a thread dedicated to collating and collecting all of the great recommendations for textbooks, online lecture series, documentaries and other resources that are frequently made\/requested on \/r\/Physics.\n\nIf you're in need of something to supplement your understanding, please feel welcome to ask in the comments.\n\nSimilarly, if you know of some amazing resource you would like to share, you're welcome to post it in the comments.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1665147611.0},{"title":"Careers\/Education Questions - Weekly Discussion Thread - October 06, 2022","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Physics\/comments\/xx4o5w\/careerseducation_questions_weekly_discussion\/","text":"This is a dedicated thread for you to seek and provide advice concerning education and careers in physics.\n\nIf you need to make an important decision regarding your future, or want to know what your options are, please feel welcome to post a comment below.\n\nA few years ago we held a graduate student panel, where many recently accepted grad students answered questions about the application process.
