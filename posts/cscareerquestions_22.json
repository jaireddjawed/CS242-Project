        "text": "Hi all,\n\nBeen a long time lurker in this community when I was searching for a career in technology/software development and I’m happy to say that I’ve had some major successes within the last 1.7 years!\n\nCurrently, my title is Senior Software Integration Engineer specifically working with my company’s SaaS Privacy Application. Initially, I was grateful and stoked to be working in technology with great pay and remote working. I’m now at a place where I do want to improve upon my technical skills, especially partaking in more custom coding and developing software engineer skills. \n\nDespite my title, my roles and responsibilities feel more aligned with that of a Privacy Analyst and Subject Matter Expert. And despite working on developing integrations and fixing bugs on a day to day basis, pretty much 99% of our development is done within our SaaS privacy application. \n\nI think working in privacy has definitely made me want to continue in this particular subfield within technology, but what are some next steps that I could do to have a true Software Engineer role?\n\nMy time frame is 6 months to 1 year and was thinking the following:\n\n1. Resume contributing to my personal projects to GitHub\n2. Resume studying CTCI for interview prep\n3. Get our company’s privacy application to a more stable build and get other junior folks to become SMEs\n4. Look for Privacy Engineering roles ~L4 level\n\nThanks all and open to any guidance!",

        "text": "Hey everyone, sorry to spam this sub. I just need to vent/get advice about the decisions I need to make. \n\nI got laid off from a job that I loved 2 months ago, I was devastated because I planned to work there for years. I've been applying to a lot of opportunities since then and I've been really worried about what I'm going to do when I run out of money to pay bills. Everywhere you look on LinkedIn it seems more people are getting laid off and are unable to find another job. \n\nLast week a company I applied to wanted to interview me. For context, this company is involved in the government sector so it's not the same field that I'm used to. Everybody was nice and seemed to enjoy working there but it was a very short interview process which kinda sketched me out (I talked about this in my previous post) but they ended up giving me an offer yesterday and I felt extremely lucky in the moment. \n\nThe thing is one of my friends that also got laid off from my old job wanted to help me find another one and recommended me to their new company, so now I have an initial screening for a company that I think I would rather work for than the one that gave me the offer yesterday.\n\nI would feel really bad that my buddy went through all that trouble to get me an interview, and then I dont even go through with it. Though on the other hand I feel bad accepting the other companies offer if I'm just going to not work there.\n\nI've been thinking maybe I should turn the company that gave me the offer down and go with the one my friend is working for, but all it is is an initial phone call, for all I know they could choose not to move forward with the process and then I'm screwed because I turned the initial offer I had down\n\nI just need some advice from people more experienced with this stuff than me. Since the job market is so bad for us right now, should I just take the sure thing and get paid even if its something I might not enjoy? or should I try interviewing for the job I think would be better? Maybe I dont have the luxury of choice right now but idk. Thanks in advance I appreciate any advice yall have to give.",

I don't know.\n\nHowever, I understand the framework well enough to continue developing my own website (e.g. views, templates, Jinja, ORM, Git, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, etc) and am pretty adept at learning new concepts quickly, but as said, I've never put my skills to use in developing my own website, working a previous web development job before, and have yet to graduate university.\n\nI'd really like to start doing more technical/interesting work and make more money. Could someone give me and link me to a comprehensive guide on how to get an entry-level job as a Django developer so that I can start applying and preparing as soon as possible? For example, languages and concepts I need to know, if I need a portfolio website, who will be interviewing me and what questions I'll be asked, starting salary ranges, job qualifications/degree requirements, etc?\n\nThank you so much for your help!",

In my mid 20s I got a break and worked for a fairly prestigious / high end web development agency doing WP and eCommerce builds for a while, before deciding to finish my education and get a degree as a mature student.\n\nI graduated in 2019 with a BSc in CS from a Russell Group university with a decent grade, then the pandemic happened so I decided to just do contract / freelance work until it all blew over, but that was wishful thinking and I've been doing it for a few years now making just enough to get by, but I desperately need more work &amp; income. Mostly been doing full stack MERN / Next.js work and lots of other random projects like Shopify work.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm literally desperate for a full time job. I've applied to more jobs than I can count but nobody is interested seemingly because of my complicated background. They either think I'm under-qualified even for junior roles because of my less-than-stellar CV and having been self-employed, even though I was employed in the industry prior to my degree. Or that I'm over-qualified for entry level / graduate roles (or that I'm not eligible because it has been longer than 2yrs since graduating). At this point I'd take any opportunity (within reason) if it means getting my foot in the door, but I'm coming across jobs with salaries so low that I'd probably be better off just getting a full time unskilled job, which is a bit soul destroying having spent a few years and tens of thousands of £s getting a degree.\n\nI feel like I've fallen between the cracks and not sure how to climb my way out. I suspect the answer is to make a more comprehensive portfolio / github to prove that I have the skills, but time is of the essence due to my financial situation.\n\nAny suggestions whatsoever would be very much appreciated, any outside perspective is like gold dust.\n\nE.g.\n\n\\- Where can I find jobs other than the usual websites?\n\n\\- Should I contact more recruiters vs finding jobs direct with companies?\n\n\\- What level should I be pitching at? Even junior roles seems to have insanely high expectations these days..\n\n\\- What approach should I take when applying e.g. transparency regarding my background vs focusing on my skills and strengths and just trying to blag roles?\n\n\\- Should I just continue freelancing for now to boost my income &amp; portfolio (make more of an effort to showcase the projects that I do), but where to find more clients??\n\nMany thanks",

I took a few CS classes, landed one software dev internship thanks to a friend of my dad's (yay nepotism), got a full-time offer after graduation and have been at this company ever since (4 years full-time). \n\nI've had two roles at this company, first in tech support then in customer training, 2 years each. So besides my internship I've never been a developer. \n\nI work for a company in a very niche sector of the industry and *everything* is proprietary, including their coding language. Furthermore the product I've been working with for the past 2 years is different from the one I worked with in my first role - my current product is very much \"low-code\" and UI-based with no coding required whatsoever. I hope it's ok that I'm not going into more details to protect my identity.\n\nI am trying to leave the company ASAP for something that is fully remote. They have a super strict office policy and it's destroying my mental health.\n\nWhat I'd really like to do is get a job using the current product I teach instead of teaching it. Theoretically based on the number of clients I've worked with there should be a pretty high demand for this. But, without getting into too many details, I am having a tough time finding opportunities and so am considering branching out and looking for a general CS job.\n\nSo my issue is that I know very little about actual programming, and I feel like a fish out of water looking at jobs that require 5+ years of experience in technologies I've never even heard of. I also don't feel like I'm a recent-grad or entry-level type situation because I do have 4-5 years of experience in the tech industry.\n\nWhat would you recommend is the first thing I do to make myself more marketable for general CS jobs? I am truly open to anything I'm qualified for that is fully remote and pays at least 90k (I make about 98k right now) - does not have to be a straight-up software dev. I would really love if there were a certification or a test I could take that would make me hireable. Having a math degree I have always greatly preferred structured tests over unstructured projects, and I understand that projects are more important in CS but I would love if there's a way I could minimize that.\n\nOne other thing I'll mention is that I've been doing some tech writing on the side at my current job and I LOVE it and would love to make that my career, however I've only been doing that for about 8 months and unfortunately none of the stuff I've written is publicly available so I wouldn't have anything to show to a hiring committee. Advice in that regard would also be appreciated.",

I fill it out, and the next day, they say they're impressed and will get back to me ASAP. Today, they sent me an email saying I'm a perfect fit along with an offer that equates to about  a little more then double a year then what the usual average entry level Software Engineering position offers and I wasn't even interviewed!\n\nThe company is legit they have everything to show for it, but the job posting on LinkedIn said it was entry-level and the pay is what you're usual pay would be. So this entire thing seems so sketchy to me!",

        "text": "Ok so I have an internship class this Spring that required me to get 40 internship hours during the Spring semester. The area I live in has like, no Spring internships. They're all Summer internships. So, I finally found a company that agreed to take me on as an intern starting 3/5 and they expect me to work part-time during the Spring semester and then full time throughout Summer. The pay sucks, they only pay $15/hour. Which is the lowest offer I've gotten.\n\nDuring the process of applying for internships, I also got an offer for a company offering me $15k for a 10 week internship starting in June. They're an insanely good company to work for.\n\nSo I accepted both internships. And my plan is basically to work at the first one that pays shittier to get my spring internship hours, then turn in 2 weeks notice halfway through May and start at the second Internship.\n\nI'm aware that this is probably not the best practice for my career, but I'm in a tough spot with trying to get my Spring internship hours and then also accepting an incredibly competitive offer for Summer. I don't need anyone to tell me that this is walking an ethical line. I'm aware that it could affect my reputation and I've decided to do what's best for me.\n\nMy main issue here is LinkedIn. I've basically just taken it off of my phone. I obviously don't want to update my LinkedIn with any employment statuses. But now the hiring manager from the first company has requested to add me to his LinkedIn network. This is what I'm asking for advice on. \n\nShould I just ignore his request? And then, if he asks me about it I can just tell him that I'm off of social media and I don't really use LinkedIn at all? Is he going to tell me that I have to have LinkedIn to work there? Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.",

My career goal has been web development (MEAN or MERN), or using C#/Java.\n\nI've been job searching since January with low response rates. Regarding the resume, I can gotten several industry professionals to overhaul it throughout the months.\n\nI recently got an offer from a Startup Company as a Software Developer, however the description is all testing related. Automation will likely occur 4-5 months into the position. They mentioned that they wanted really strong developers for this position. \n\nThe offer letter says that job responsibilities can change at any time. The job description mentions that they are invested in my growth. Honestly speaking, I really loved the team during the interview process. I've never really had that experience before. The product is also interesting, in Electric Cars.\n\nMy only other prospect is Wiley Edge (a company that trains you for 8 weeks, contracts you to their clients, pay you 60k). If I got the job, I wouldn't start until June (due to the training), and it's an insurance company (they don't have any other client in Toronto). I don't think insurance is that interesting, but it would be Full Stack Development.\n\nI really feel like I should go for the Startup, and hope that maybe I could take up some extra development tasks. Or maybe showcase my skills so that they would consider me into development later on. Especially since they wanted a strong developer to begin with. Any opinions on my thought process?\n\nIf I take this path, does anyone have advice on what I should make sure to do on the job to best turn this opportunity towards Development, either in the company, or when I eventually move on in the future\n\nI appreciate any feedback!",

Making entire apps on its own is going to be a matter of doing the same thing it's already doing but better, which is probably a matter of improving the current technology.\n\nNow that technology is doing a basic form of my job except taking seconds to do what could take me hours, I'm not that proud of being good at it anymore, and since the technology to eventually put me out of a job is being developed, I feel that I'm just not that emotionally invested in my career anymore.

        "text": "I've noticed that PRs seem to be a major blocker at our company. I've always viewed PRs as code that is at a finished or near finished state, so when I'm asked to review a PR, I make an effort to put eyes on it within 24 hours and provide a review within 48 hours unless I'm on vacation or something. I noticed that other devs seem to view PRs as the absolute lowest priority, so PRs that I'm not tagged in can sit for weeks.\n\nWhen I review a PR, the first thing I do is try to understand what the code should be doing. Usually there's a ticket attached so it's not too hard to figure out. I take 5 minutes to pull in the feature branch and try to see if the feature works/try to break it. This is the quickest way that I've found to catch any obvious bugs in the code. I think I'm the only reviewer among the other devs who makes an effort to try to understand what the code is doing/pulls in the branch and makes sure it works. I don't understand how you can review a PR without even understanding what the code is doing or what the purpose of the ticket that the PR is trying to address was? \n\nIf the feature works as expected, I then look closer into the code to check for logical errors or clear issues. The amount of effort I put into this part depends on how critical the feature is. If it's going to have a major impact on production processes, I'll spend more time making sure its optimized. I try to remember not to insert my own opinions of how things should be done, but to adhere to any styling guide or patterns that already exists in the code, if there's no guide or patterns, then this is less important to me. \n\nBeyond that, when changes that I do request get made, I go in and approve the PR. I've noticed other devs need to be constantly prompted to go back and approve or update their review even days after changes were made. I also have no qualms about simply saying \"looks good to me\" and approving if everything above sat well with me, yet other devs seem to never do this, but must always insert some (usually meaningless) comment and request changes for something unimportant. I can only imagine they do this because they feel like if they just approved it with LGTM it would be like they didn't even review it. We do not get tracked or measured on how many PR comments we give, so I guess this is just an ego thing? I don't even know..\n\nI am not a manager or lead. Many of these PRs are in codebases that our team does not have ownership of. Is this just something that we have to live with? The managers don't seem to care or don't seem to realize this is a problem. Is there anything I can do to make this process less painful?",

How can I refresh my memory on CS topics? What should I be looking to do to improve my employability within CS? How should I prepare for interviews?

        "text": "Hi everyone, In the last years I worked on a startup that was acquired by a big company, unfortunately the big company decided to shutdown the startup to reduce some costs. We had a brand new product (where I've been involved) to launch, but it will never see the light of day, and this makes me very upset, they didn't even give us time to show test the MVP.\n\nAlthough this outcome seems like a total failure, I worked with very talented people, and we managed to survive for a few years until we were acquired, which I see as a positive thing, most startups don't have this chance.\n\nAt the moment I am in a calm situation. I have saved a lot of money, and I will receive my compensation. I also have some stock options in one of the biggest companies in the world, which gives me time to relax a little, and calmly look for a new job. I've also improved a lot on a technical level, but I'm going to take advantage of these months that I'll be unemployed to improve even more and delve deeper into some topics\n\nMy former colleagues are very committed to helping everyone to get a new job, a group was even created to deal with it, so I don't feel that nervousness I had when looking for my first job\n\nI would like to know how should I behave in the interviews. The company whole project failed, but we managed to achieve a lot of goals, I wish I could sell this without employers thinking that all the people in the company were terrible, due to the fact that the company was shutdown.",

But from hearing people's views on art careers, I'm starting to stress out. Some say very few are successful, others saying pay is not well. This lead me to looking at other careers. I was thinking computer engineering sounds interesting and also the pay is good. But I'm not really a smart guy if I'm going to be honest. Physics is probably my hated subject back in high school. But when I do put all my time into passing those classes and learning. It makes me sad that I wouldn't have time for my art and art is all I think about. I would be derepressed on what I could’ve done.\nAny ideas? Should I continue to pursue my unpredictable art career? Or change to something that'll keep me stable?\n1, Share",

It's no ordinary bootcamp - it's a bootcamp for people who already have a strong foundation in the fundamentals of web programming (backend frameworks, databases, front-end frameworks / libraries, RESTful APIs, HTML, CSS, client-side Javascript). In other words, I am a self taught programmer with a few small projects right now. The bootcamp would take me to the next level working on a complex project on a team; where the end goal is to obtain a mid-senior role. But the bootcamp lasts for up to 7-8 months full time (not allowed to work) and It's very cost prohibitive especially while I have a family to support.\n\nGiven the economic / job climate and the tech jobs getting cut I'm wondering what my chances are as a self-taught programmer with basic skills to get  a job are? Am I facing too much competition? Am I better off doing the bootcamp at this point to make myself more marketable? (Even if it means dipping into my saving and possibly my retirement?) I'm just worried that even if I do the bootcamp, the job market will still be bad and I'll be broke and jobless... help?\n\nTLDR: Is it possible for me  (a self taught programmer) to land a job as a software engineer in this economic climate? Or should I spend thousands of dollars (likely 50K+ all in dipping into my retirement) for a bootcamp where I hope to find a job 8 months from now.",

        "text": "One of my friend who is a college dropout recently joined a no name witch consulting firm. They gave him about 2 months of sql training and were able to place him at wells fargo as a lead sql developer.\n\nI was shocked to hear about his whole interview process. He told me how the interview process was a total sham. He had an indian guy on call secretly listening and answering the questions during the video interview and all he had to do was move his lips to make it look like he was the one speaking.\n\n They created a fake resume for him with almost 10 years of extensive experience and my friend has literally 0 years of tech experience and has literally never even written a single line of code before. All of this and now he is getting paid $65/hr. \n\nI am happy that my friend is doing well because he was working 80 hours every week at the warehouse before. But I dont see how its fair for people who do it the right way. If you can just scam your way into the industry what's the point of even getting a degree and doing it the right way\n\n Also how are these big banks getting so easily fooled by these indian scammers. It just boggles my mind. How is this even legal in the US.",

In that time, our only all-hands have been scheduled weeks in advance on each quarter and they've been an hour long. We had layoffs last year and the last couple of quarters were rough-ish-but-getting-better. The VP of engineering didn't know there was going to be a meeting until the invites were sent.

My content is pretty similar to the league tiktoker, Dantes, if you wanted to have a frame of reference. I don't really want to share my tiktok on this throwaway account.\n\nI'm sure if I private my social media now, 2 years in the future NO ONE would be able to recognize me and people would surely forget about me. But this a hobby of mine that I enjoy, and I'm certainly something I want to do in the future.\n\nI'm worried the association coming with all the cringe might affect job opportunities LOL.

I'm about to have to go back to working in retail, but my rent has increased so much that I don't think I can live off the $14/I was making there. I know both options suck, but which one sucks less?\nI have interviews with both tomorrow. Here's what I know about them:\n\n\nDev10: pays 600/week during training, then 24 months of 50k for the first year, 60k for the second. Salaried regardless of job placement. Can be relocated anywhere in USA, $1500 relocation pay\n\n\nGenspark: pays $250/week during training, then 18 months of $20-$30 (so $20 lol) per hour for first year, then increases $5/hour. If not placed on a job, pay is $10/hour until placed. Can be relocated anywhere in Central or Eastern USA, also $1500 relocation pay.\n\n\nMy conflict: I have a lot of debt so the higher pay and guaranteed income of Dev10 would really help. Also, the training pay for Genspark isn't enough to cover rent, I would need to keep one of my two current part-time jobs as well.\n\nBut on the flip side I also have my child's other parent to consider, so the 6-month shorter contract is a big plus for me. So is the fact that I'm guaranteed to stay on this half of the country. I can legally move out of state because we don't have a parenting plan (Florida version of a custody/visitation agreement) and I have all of the parenting responsibility, but I feel like a real asshole (the child is fine with moving and even excited about the idea, so don't come at me about that lol).\n\nI'm seriously desperate so if either cohort offers me a spot I'm gonna take it, but if they both offer I can't decide which one to do!",
