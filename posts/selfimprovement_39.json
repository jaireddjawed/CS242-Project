I always thought that it was my problem with procrastination that mattered - now that I mostly got over it, I still have some problems with good work-life balance. I just saw that I don't prioritize my exam (that is in 3 hours) and I would rather do other things, while thinking \"oh yes, I'm gonna do it next\", but it just got to me that this is really, really risky. Why didn't I feel this earlier? Why didn't I protise exam which is more important and I did something that was more pleasant?\nI heard that people with ADHD struggle with task PRIORITIZING. It just got to me. It's maybe not only being a massive procrastinator that was the problem. Do You guys struggle with right amount of stress and risk in life?",

        "text": "I'm trying to wake up at the same time everyday but last night I slept a bit too late and I only got 5 and a half hours last night. I put my alarm across the room too. But if I didn't need to use the bathroom I would've just gone back to bed. I was in the middle of a good dream and felt perfectly comfy. After about 7 minutes I'm much more awake and could still fall asleep rn but I also have the logic to stay awake lol. When I first wake up it's like I can't even think my body is comfortable and sleepy so it just makes me fall back asleep lol. \n\nSorry I'm still sleepy so I'm rambling, is there anyway to make waking up not feel heartbreaking? Literally for the first minute of waking up my body and brain said \"I would literally rather kill myself than go to school and learn. That goes away pretty quick but well actually now that I'm thinking about it it's probably some kind of \"trauma\" from always waking up late af for school. I think I might still associate waking up with something horrible so I automatically think I might as well sleep as much as I can to escape it longer. Maybe I'm overthinking that though. Idk. I'm tired and struggling to stay awake now lol. \nI wonder how I could waking up feel positive instead of waking up just because I have to. Damn I think I figured out why waking up is hard for me now. I used to sleep in because I hated school but I don't do that anymore. I'd stay up late because I wanted to do something fun with my only free-time, but if I wake up early I can do that as well. I think I preferred night because mornings always feel like they're shorter. \n\nomg I'm rambling so much sorry. I'll just ask my question again- how do I make the early morning (5:30am) feel preferable to staying up late?",

        "text": "This advice is from a true story...\n\n In 1918, the head of Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Charles M. Schwab, was determined to find a way to improve his company's productivity and profitability. He sought the expertise of renowned productivity consultant, Ivy Lee, to give him the edge he needed to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nWhen Lee was asked about his fee, he made a bold offer. He would meet with each of Schwab's executives for 15 minutes and would only be paid what the advice was worth to them in three months' time. Schwab agreed to the deal, and each of his executives was given a chance to meet with Lee.\n\nDuring these meetings, Lee shared with the executives a simple yet powerful productivity technique. He instructed them to write down the six most important tasks they needed to complete the following day and prioritize them in order of importance. The next day, they were to begin with the first task and only move on to the next once the first was completed. If any tasks were not finished, they were to be added to the next day's task sheet. Lee emphasized the importance of repeating this process for three months.\n\nThree months later, Schwab was so impressed with the results that he called Lee back into his office and wrote him a check for $25,000, which is equivalent to over half a million dollars in today's currency. Schwab later credited this piece of advice as the most valuable he had ever received and attributed its success to its simplicity and focus on the most important tasks.\n\nThe technique taught by Ivy Lee continues to be used by successful individuals and companies to this day, proving that true productivity and profitability can be achieved by focusing on the most important tasks and seeing them through to completion.",

Each day was difficult, I never had energy to do anything and for the longest time, I thought it was because of my lifestyle. I slept 14h/day, didn't exercise and ate anything I can, mostly unhealthy food. I also have a desk job, so it suited me in a way. EXCEPT.\n\nExcept that I'm transgender and decided to take hormones a few years ago. Testosterone changed a few things in my behaviour, most importantly my impulsivity and my libido (hormones are important somehow). And I had a bit more of energy throughout the day, so I was thrilled. BUT PLOT TWIST.\n\nDuring the medical exams to check if everything was okay to start taking hormones, the doctor discovered that I had a thyroid disease, which is apparently pretty common with AFAB people. He said to me that sometimes, symptoms developed with time and because I didn't felt any different than my teenage years, we decided to not treat it yet. Until now, 3 years later, because I wasn't showing any symptoms beside the physical one ( being cold all the time), he told me to start medication.\n\nAnd now everything's changed ?? I feel like how I felt on my few best days in my life but all the time ?? I sleep 8 hours a day like a normal person !! I'm not cold anymore ofc but also I'm not depressed ? I was afraid it would be for a few days but now it's been weeks and I've never feel so capable.\n\nI don't say depression and mental health issue are not real, in the contrary. What I thought was psychological turned out to be a physical issue, but the advice stays the same. It is not normal to feel this way and it's totally ok to do something about it,.even if you have been \"like this\" for as long as you remember",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/10xjcpg/discovering_your_core_values_and_creating_your/",
        "text": " \n\n**Living a fulfilling and meaningful life** requires a sense of direction and purpose. If you're feeling lost or unsatisfied with your life, one of the most effective ways to find direction and clarity is to identify your core values. This will enable you to create a big picture of yourself. In this article, we'll explore what this process entails and how you can go about finding your core values and creating your ideal self.\n\n**Step 1: Reflect on Your Experiences**\n\nThe first step in identifying your core values is to reflect on your experiences. Think about the moments in your life that have been most meaningful to you. What were the values or principles that were at the core of these experiences? What makes them so meaningful to you? This reflection can help you gain insight into what truly matters to you and what drives you.\n\n**Step 2: Make a List of Your Values**\n\nOnce you've had time to reflect, it's time to make a list of your values. Write down a list of the things that are most relevant to you, such as honesty, kindness, creativity, or family. Try to keep the list to about 5-10 values, as having too many values can make it difficult to focus and prioritize.\n\n**Step 3: Prioritize Your Values**\n\nWith your list of values in hand, it's time to think about which ones are most significant to you. This process of prioritization can help you make decisions and stay focused on what matters most. You may find it helpful to rank your values in order of priority or to identify which values are non-negotiable for you.\n\n**Step 4: Create a Big Picture**\n\nUsing your values as a guide, it's time to create a big picture of your ideal self. Imagine what your life would look like if you lived in alignment with your values. What do you want to achieve in your personal and professional life? What kind of person do you want to be? Visualize what success and happiness look like for you, and hold onto this image as you take action toward your goals.\n\n**Step 5: Take Action**\n\nOnce you have a clear idea of the big picture and your values, it's time to take action. Start by making small changes to your relationships, career, or personal habits that align with your values. Set achievable goals for yourself, and celebrate your successes along the way. Remember that this process is ongoing and that you may need to revisit your values and the big picture from time to time as you grow and evolve.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFinding your core values and creating a big picture of yourself can be a powerful and transformative process. By reflecting on your experiences, making a list of your values, prioritizing your values, creating a big picture, and taking action, you can gain a sense of direction and purpose and start living a life that is meaningful and fulfilling. Stay true to yourself and your values, and keep taking steps towards becoming your ideal self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, You Can Read More on \" superselfpower dot com \"",

        "text": "Hey guys! I am (19 y/o, male)\n\nTL;DR \n\nI always feel as if I am missing something… I feel that I cannot be present in the moment of what I am doing without realizing that there are other things that I am missing out on—(mainly being: that there is so much information out there on the internet, in order to become the best person possible. What is the best website? What is the best podcast? Article? App? Etc. I would love the answers and to be pointed in the right direction… but also to solve this problem and to become a better person…\n\n————————————————————\n\nRecently, I have been trying to find the right system for productivity and how to study effectively, along with this, the right workout program.\n\nI do not workout regularly, only every now and then. I did do athletics in high school, but I have not been able to set a goal and work towards it after being out of high school. I would like to become stronger and leaner.\n\nI only take two online courses for college, and I have a part-time job. I live with my parents still.\n\nI want to improve myself, however, I feel that I overwhelm myself before beginning, or that I feel that whatever I am doing is a waste of my time, as the answer is already out there. \n\nWith books, I would like to continue reading from my book list, but since there are summaries on Google of them, I think: why bother?\n\nWhat is your guys’ advice? Is there a simple productivity, habit system to solve this problem? I want to be a better person… but how do I go about this without looking up how to, procrastinating, and trying to find the next thing? \n\nAdvice appreciated…\nGod bless",

At the end of my Freshman year of high school, I was able to just barely join a different friend group, one that is not a loser friend group but I also wouldn't consider it popular either. This new friend group has been alright, however, I myself was an awkward loser when initially joining the friend group and now I feel as if that's all I'm known for within the friend group, even though I feel as if I have finally broken out of that through my experience with the friend group.\n\nAs well as I feel as if I blundered in the sense that I failed to establish strong friendships and I have the tendency to not be proactive with friends until it's too late. I also feel as if I'm always the \"second-or-below\" friend, just waiting to be replaced by a closer friend, i.e. I feel like certain people hang out with me because they feel as if I'm their only option at that particular point in time.\n\nAdditionally, it feels like I don't have someone to gravitate towards during get-togethers within the friend group, although this may no longer be the case as more people have been added, and those people that were added, I'm pretty close to. \n\nI also feel as if I screwed up in how I had the possibility to join a friend group I would have felt better in, during middle school and even in my freshman year of high school but it feels as if I missed all of my chances and I keep getting put into classes with the same people. I also moved a lot so I was unable to establish a tight-knit friend group in elementary school.\n\nI just feel as if I have missed all of my chances and I don't know what to do, and on top of that Adderall makes me feel more awkward, or at least I think it does. To those of you taking Adderall let me know if it has a similar effect or if I'm just shifting the blame from myself to my medication.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you for your time.",

I have no issues with this BUT whenever they have guys night, us girls do a girls night. \n\nOne of the friends, let’s call him Steve (28M), hates that we do it and complains every time that we are “stealing their idea”. It goes so far that we can’t even have our girls night in the same vicinity as where they’re hanging out. One time we ended up in the same general area and was told “to stay away”. \n\nIt really annoys me because if we ever have plan a girls day, Steve HAS to have a guys hangout too. Like it’s a competition. Just the fact that he’s so hypocritical has made me very petty over the years. I hate being told what I can and can’t do especially when it doesn’t affect the person. I’m really tired of feeling petty and annoyed when all I want to do is hang out with my friends. I want to let it go but I can’t seem to figure out how to not get irritated.",

maybe for their favors, may be to show you the importance of their existence at your life, maybe to be your time wasters to draw back, maybe to control your life, or to manipulate you to burnout to show off or the envy your life.\n\nAggressors are listed deep down with all tactics needed to overcome and break the habits in the book of Robert Greene “The Laws of Human Nature”\n\nDon’t give time for fake pitfalls, as both kinds are the pure form of toxicity and the best decision to make is to leave if you can handle loss, or survive till you can leave; if you will go for that option you should act fool sometimes and leave a room for them to win to balance your life.\n\n**Every new day has its challenges and opportunities and you have the choice to snip it**\n\nlife is full of challenges daily and wide opportunities to everyone prioritize, implement, remap and restructure your thoughts, these are the major perks should be aligned to get over challenges and use opportunities in appropriate way.\n\nAlways move forward no matter what, as it’s the best solution to these challenges.\n\nNot all challenges need your foresight or sight and you won’t have a full control over it at the time of occurrence, and some challenges fadeout as it wasn’t the urge in the first place.\n\n**How to use the storm for your favor?**\n\nStorms have many diversities of reasons and parties, it’s important to weigh every challenge and what should have resolution on spot, then plan based on the storm consequences not on your intensions or feelings.\n\nIf it’s a real storm it will fade out by your proper initiatives toward resolution.\n\nIf its fake one, it will disappear by your new milestones and successful steps ahead.\n\nWhat hit the nail, that not all what you face reflect the real permanent situation.\n\nSome people seek to be your distraction, time wasters, if you kept moving forward they won’t be able to fight back but you should be one of the rebellions.\n\n**Here are some steps to beat negative vibes and thoughts and regain your momentum way better**\n\n1. Accept: in order to go forward.\n\n2. Plan: to go over showstoppers.\n\n3. Release: hard times to be able to think clearly.\n\n4. Implement: your plan wisely.\n\n5. Elevate: by tracking your path not others to be a better version than yesterday.\n\n6. Enjoy: little things, and your milestones, and keep it low.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIf you reacted same like before you will go straight forward to the same paradox, patterns, and end results.\n\nMoving forward is not just affirmations, you should believe deep down, and take all initiatives needed to control your guts and act like riders on the storm who have limitless control over any circumstances faced.",

That ego boost lead me to kind of abandoning self care, started shaving like once a week (i get a beard by then), started eating two meals a day with snacks that contain carbs and sugar, therefore my skin got worse, which now in result makes it harder to shave cleanly, gained a lot of face fst and a little bit on belly but thats not really noticable. Deleted tinder a week ago, but im struggling to get back to a healthy lifestyle, eating way too much and unhealthily, tried a fast but only managed 18 hours. How do i go back. Seems like i lost all sense of discipline",

Whether that be a business, a youtube channel, a blog or an exercise routine. If you’re reading this and what I've said has made you think of something then congratulations, you know what it is you need to start.\n\nAnd this is your sign to start it right now\n\nThere's a lot of comfort in having the idea to do something. Having plans and ideas can act as a safety blanket of achievement. Making you feel like you've achieved something when in reality you haven't even started. This sense of gratification is far better than the feeling of disappointment of starting something and failing. This is why a lot of people never even start.\n\nPeople will spend a lot of time researching the perfect gym routine before even stepping into a gym.\n\n**There's discomfort in starting.**\n\nStarting makes you vulnerable to failure and that vulnerability sucks.\n\nBut **if you never start you will fail anyway**. No one wants to hear about the business idea you had but never acted on, or the gym routine you never implemented or the YouTube account you never started. Planning these things feels gratifying but they have no real-world implications.\n\nUnless you voice them, you will never be remembered for your ideas.\n\nSo this is your sign to stop planning, stop overthinking and stop waiting until a better time.\n\n**This is your time to start.**\n\nToday.\n\nWhatever it is, whatever the first step is. Maybe it's buying a domain name, or contacting a supplier, or sending an email, or writing a blog post. Just start it, **you’ll learn more through 2 weeks of starting than 2 months of preparing.**\n\nDon't let the fear of others opinions deter you from starting. If you want it enough, the discomfort will be worth it. \n\n“If someone taking the piss out of your dream is enough to stop you, they just saved you time. You should thank them.” - Jimmy Carr\n\nI want you to keep that quote in the forefront of your mind for the next week and I want you to start that thing man.\n\nYou’ve got this.\n\n\\-Joe",

        "text": "(Mentions of self harm and self hatred. If you're not in the right headspace, I'd recommend not reading any further. Your health is important friend)\n\nI (M17) had anger issues growing up. At 9 years old, i was taken out of school and put into a special needs school. Alone side that, i was forced to talk to therapists and phycologist, and i was put through multiple \"programs/courses\".\nAfter a few years i no longer expressed my anger onto other people, or in a way that bothered other people, so they consider it a win.\n\nHowever, they left me with what i believe is a seriously unhealthy relationship with anger.\nThey would make anger out to be this boogyman, this great evil, a bad emotion. And i knew that when i expressed it, people got hurt, i got yelled at, mentors got disappointed etc. They made me feel like i was a bad person whenever i was angry. They said i choose to be angry and hurt people. I couldn't control it. So i felt like i was my anger.\n\nNow, 7-8 years later, whenever i feel the slightest bit of frustration or anger, it's an emotional rollercoaster.\nI'll get angry, then I'll get angry at myself for getting angry. Combined with immense guilt. This just makes me more angry. Self hatred begins burning. Words cannot describe how fucking much i hate myself when it happens. I feel like i wanna break my bones and slam my head through a wall. I cannot scream, because that'll bother my surrounding. I'll be a bad entitled kid who takes his problems out on other people. I can't slam my hand into a table, because someone paid for said table, my anger would once again hurt someone.\nIt usually just ends with me beating myself up. Literally. It makes sense, in my head, I'm an absolute piece of shit for even experiencing this amount of rage to begin with. It just makes sense that i should take the consequences for it.\n\nI wanna be able to handle anger and frustration without getting stuck in a spiral of self hatred.",

I mean, we are still in the school, so you may think that there's nothing to explore yet, but that would be not true. The world is so colourful and often underestimated that we have tons of things to experience. Thus, should I still be with them, even though sometimes it may be disappointing and frustrating for me to watch them \"degrading\"?\n We live in a great, huge city (population is around a million) and I'd like to find some new people either of my age (I'm 17) or older. That seems to me to be a problem, because I've never done it before and also there is a \\/\\/@r outside, so many people might be just afraid of going out on the street and schools don't work for now and for this reason I can't even socialize enough which also doesn't make me feel alright.\n Besides, I understand that it may not be the rightest time, nonethelss we still live and need to aim at something, otherwise our society will collapse.",

While it started off fine, I started to notice that everyone only asked questions to my friend, despite the fact I was the one doing the problem. No one really made eye contact with me/addressed me and suddenly I felt like myself in middle school, shying away and self doubting everything I said and did.

It's always been a back and forth with fearing all and every kinds of food to eating everything I can because of how depressed I am. \n\nFast food, fried foods and sugar were my biggest fear... I'd still be lying if it didn't scare me a bit still. However, I love them so much. I love the convenience of having them and I especially love to devour them whole when I sit with myself in pain and can easily just order delivery for all these things. It's very difficult as well since my family consumes all of these things past a level of moderation. It's all the same cycle of hating these things but desiring them so bad and when I do devour it, I hate myself immensely. I go on cycles of just eating it for every meal to trying to eat healthy but it's such a stressful and overwhelming feeling to disect. \n\nI've started to try and get more active with lifting. I detest cardio but I'm hoping to really incorporate into my sessions. I'm trying to understand that appearing big is okay, even if it's a wealthy look. My goal is to try and get super muscular even though a lot of that means I need to start putting on some weight. The problem comes here where I try to help myself heal my relationship with food. \n\nFor the entire month of February, I am giving myself the challenge to not have any fast food and to instead, try and cook whatever food I crave in the kitchen as I ironically am in love with cooking. Today is hard, I want nothing more than to have shitty fast food but at the same time I don't want to villainize this source of convenience. I want to simply be able to eat it in moderation, I want to see this as something that I can enjoy but also know that my interest in more whole foods and healthier consumption is good for me. I want to be okay with eating both whole foods and processed foods. Even when I want to work with whole foods, that it's okay that I'm eating whatever I want because eating is a necessary and should be a joyful experience.",

        "text": "Over 10 years ago I began online homeschooling (with me and my sister as the only students and my father as the teacher). At grade school I barely learned anything, lost attention constantly, and the students from 1st-5th grade weren’t very social, there were almost no friendships. During late 5th-grade I was very upset when I realized all the kids on many TV shows have this “independence from adults” and one day, I spit a mouthful of water all over my aide (I had to have an aide follow me around in school because of my special needs and zero attention span, by 4-5th grade I was thinking of Mario and Kirby all the time) when she was angry that I was so distracted. That’s when my parents decided to homeschool me. Ever since then, unlike my younger sister attending dance class, I have rarely been to places without one of my parents next to me and I rarely got to be around peers of my age again, and still never have had a non-family friend in my age group as well. My father would take me constantly to parks and even theme parks, but no one would ever talk back to me when I spoke to them. On my first day of homeschool high school, I panicked, realizing my true fate. I would never be like any other teenager. By my 16th birthday wanted to be dating and driving and hanging out with friends I’d still be close with today, but that never happened. My dreams of living life like a teen anime character or an 80s teen comedy character were doomed, but at least I was saved from bullying/drama, and homeschooling was ideal for someone like me who went from a non-participant to a well educated student.\n\nIn 2020 my depression mutated into hatred and crippling annoyance of certain external things in public (triggers). Thanks to that, even in 2023, at 21 and a half years old, I still am not able to have a license, car, independence, or a job. My father suggests to me “it could be hard to make friends and have a girlfriend because many young people are still maturing and too wrapped up in themselves as they educate themselves or focus on working” which I think is only halfway true. I have a great Dad and family thankfully and they’re the most special people in my life. No possible friends could be as special, but every day still feels like I missing out. \n\nMy favorite YouTuber, a car reviewer and enthusiast, has a business that had a big buyout, and he bought his dream million dollar supercar. He tells a story, which immediately triggers my jealousy. On his first date with a girl he met shortly after his 16th birthday in 2005, he saw this model of supercar when it was brand new next to a house worth less than the car. He couldn’t believe what he saw, and he told all of his best friends, also car enthusiasts (I never had a car enthusiast friend in my life) they didn’t believe him, so he borrowed his parents’ camera to take a picture of the car, which lead to a new hobby of supercar spotting (at age 20 he was featured on a car magazine), which lead to his success with journalism, to his massive success with YouTube years later. When he got married in 2017, despite meeting his wife in college (around when he was age 18-19 working in student council) the wedding date was on the exact day he spotted the supercar on his first date when he was 16. The supercar was mentioned in his wedding vows and the rings were placed on small models of the car. It’s a truly magical story, and a magical vehicle.\n\nEven though I admire him and view him almost like a real friend, my jealousy of this YouTuber was triggered before because he explained when he was 17 to 18 he got to work at a Ferrari dealership and drive a lot of exotic cars, but even though there’s a lot to envy about him, there’s a lack of “thank you Mom and Dad” and “thank you siblings” from that video when he revealed he bought the million dollar supercar and achieved his ultimate dream. I know that having a family who loves you is the best thing that you could have, something that make anyone without one jealous. I never meant that I wanted to trade my life with this guy, I’m just upset that some people had more developmental experiences as a teenager, since I’m developmentally delayed with my autism.\n\nI wish I didn’t have this jealousy so I could not have these conundrums and triggers ignited. What can I do to teach myself to overcome this and let go of the past? How can I stop being jealous of those who lived life as teenagers like they were from a teen comedy or a school anime?",

I know we were dumb kids, maybe was because sometimes I got better grades than they, or just for wearing glasses, idk. So I had to learn to live alone and fight. \n\nOn secondary (Like 12 years) I changed school and things... went pretty well. At least I wasn't bullied. But on last year of secondary (15 years) all changed. The pandemic cancelled all my plans, I basically lost contact with all my class after online graduation and my grandfather, who I loved with all my heart, died from lung cancer. I was devastated, but I had to care my mother and all my family, so I couldn't have had the chance to be sad. Later, a girl who was interested on me, and so was I and helped me a bit to overcome my depression, left me with no reason and we lost contact. Studying now in baccalaureate (16-18) I found a new social circle, and last year I had a crush on a introverted girl that I introduced to my social circle and I loved her so much... Well... I didn't wanted to say nothing because that would be a distraction, and focused studying and wanted to say that I loved her on the graduation party... Or I thought. A boy of my social circle came and won her love days before the graduation. After graduation I only keep a two friends of baccalaureate. The rest I thought would be with \nme... Wrong. \n\nAnd now I'm here. Basically alone, depressed af, doing some workout on the gym, studying CS that I thought I would like and I'm not enjoying because I don't enjoy nothing more in my life, hoping to grow a bit more my height with a good feeding and vitamins, but I see myself on the mirror and I even smaller, trying to remove pimples and going to the psychologist while I realize that my life was a shit and still being, because it's all the same but different year.",

My brain automatically thinks about tiktok and social media as soon as I grab the book. The urge to start a book is huge, I WANT to read books, as many as I can but every time I start I get bored after a while (if I ever focus enough to start reading). This led me to read stories on Wattpad on my phone which most aren’t good and I think it’s not good at all, it’s a quick fix instead of reading something well written and even long. I want to start reading again and being away from my phone to re wire my brain. Has anyone been through the same? Do you have any tips?",

        "text": "We're together for a year now. But for a couple of months I've started becoming very, very insecure about gf. It's not like anything has changed since we're together. We're both loyal to each other and would never hurt each other.\n\nThe fact is that my gf has a lot of male close friends and I do not have a single female close friend, but would rather call the friends. \n\nShe talks with her male friends frequently. And when she does, I start overthinking and losing trust in myself first, and then on my gf. I really want to change.\n\nI do not want to have this mindset. We've had a lot of fights and arguments over this issue. I'm honest with my gf so I address this issue directly to her, but then we both end up getting hurt. She constantly reminds me that loves me the most and would never ever hurt me in any way. \n\nI really wanna improve myself. I've forgotten my hobbies, my desires, my dreams, even my old self when I was satisfied with what I do. But now this change has mentally affected me. It's growing on me day by day.\n\nI wanna exercise, resume my hobbies, complete my college work on time, and wanna be with myself for atleast some while, to bring myself back. But my mind is not letting me have the control.\n\nKind strangers, please help me out.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am 23M. I graduated from college this past May.\n\nI had a tough 2022. At the end of 2021 I was exercising most days of the week, eating right, doing hobbies, etc. I lost 40 lbs of covid weight (went from 187 to 145) I felt better than I had in quite a long time.\n\nThe beginning of 2022 hit me like a brick for many reasons in my personal life. Details are unnecessary. \n\nI've had trouble with nicotine addiction the last few years. \n\nNow a whole year has gone by, and I feel lost. I have regained some of that weight (now up to 165). I don't exercise anymore, I've started smoking again, and I just feel discontented with my life. \n\nI have a beautiful girlfriend (21F) that I sometimes feel I don't deserve, and I want to be a better man for her, a good man, but I just can't seem to find the strength. \n\nI feel like no matter what I do to change my life, things won't improve. My mind is just bearing down on me, and I worry it won't stop. \n\nRegardless, I have a plan to get better. I've booked a date with a therapist, and I have just gotten a gym membership.\n\nI plan on trying to run for a half hour at least 4 days out of the week. I'm going to stop smoking; I'm going to start meditating again and I am going to stop snacking. \n\nI would also like to get on some sort of mental health medication.\n\nI suppose we'll build from there. I'm going to start tomorrow. \n\nAny advice or thoughts on all of this would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading.",
