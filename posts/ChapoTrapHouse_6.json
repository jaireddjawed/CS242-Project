        "text": "I'm just really down rn. Not only do I have to spend a hundred a month on treatment because we live in a society, but now this kavanaugh shit is just rubbing it in my face.  \n  \n  People keep trying to tell me that this guy's life is ruined just because he can't coach basketball. Meanwhile I'm struggling every fucking day with my sexual trauma PTSD that I can barely afford to treat. I also just started a new blood pressure medication to help me sleep (cause, ya know, nightmares) and I'm not liking the side effects. No one is hiring me and my student loan disbursement hasn't come in yet so the anxiety is high right now. \n\n  Despite all this I wanna thank you guys for being cool. This isn't some joke or anything. I really appreciate knowing there are more people out there that actually care about other people. I hope you all have a beautiful day and maybe get to pet a friendly dog on your way into work/class/ect.   ",

The justifiable and rightful fear of abortion being outlawed is a powerful tool to harness to our side.\n\nDon't let them weaponize identity against us.

        "text": "So we all know about how the History Channel, Discovery Channel, National Geographic etc have been relentlessly eviscerated by market forces to change from slight if accessible documentaries to reality TV shows. Another thing that happened, though, is that even the ones that avoided the gutter have been sucked into the neoliberal void of adding up the dollars and cents on everything so that learning is no longer an end in and of itself, but has to be in service of improving one's position in the market, the same thing that sends tech executives to Burning Man so they can recharge and come back with renewed productivity. This is how you get [Machiavelli on Management](https://www.amazon.com/Machiavelli-Management-Playing-Winning-Corporate/dp/0275936996).\n\nTED is the prime example of this, the tagline of \"ideas worth spreading\" giving the game away, but it was always shit so who cares (no joke: one of the talks on its front page now is \"How we could teach our bodies to heal faster\"). Instead I want to point to the Great Courses, which was very important to me growing up; basically the Great Courses are taped lecture series by college professors on a particular topic. The real center were the history lectures, which might vary from the history of Africa to the French Revolution to the Old Testament in context, but there were also lectures on science, anthropology, sociology, art theory, etc. They weren't cheap, usually running from $20-60 when on sale, but it was still a pretty good deal for twelve to twenty four hours of university level education.\n\nNow you go on the [website](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/) and all the best sellers are self improvement bullshit, from the reasonable (Fundamentals of Photography) to the ridiculous (Optimizing Brain Fitness). Of the five most recent, there is one history series, *two* management guides, and two self improvement instructions. You scroll down and you see \"Ancient Civilizations of North America\" right next to \"iRest: Integrative Restoration Yoga Nidra for Deep Relaxation\".\n\nGoing through the recent catalog is a perfect illustration of culture being eaten by pure market ideology. The Iliad is all well and good, but how will it help me win friends and influence people? It's hell.",
