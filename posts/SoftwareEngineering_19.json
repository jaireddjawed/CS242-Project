How do you stay online or keep your software in an operational state while migrating your codebase to something really different? Do you replace one service at a time? Do you replace small functions of the code in the new language and return the results still to the old code base? Do you replace everything at once and turn it offline and the new thing offline all at once?\n\n\nOr another example is the migration from objective c to swift in iOS-programming? How do companies approach these task without fucking up everything?",

As a software developer you of course don't have you remember everything by heart, but it's always great to have this kind of \"notebook\" where you can look at - which simply summarizes everything you learned. Let's call this a \"private knowledge management system\", a mix of cheat sheet, guidelines, personal hints and notes in general. \n\nIf you use such a technology at your own, which one can you recommend, which one do you personally use? I'm currently looking for an adequate tool but I'm not sure yet which one to use.\n\nE.g. there are applications like Boostnote, Evernote. There're also wikis like 'Dokuwiki'. Do you host it? On your own server/webspace? Is there any service to use such things as SaaS to avoid the overhead? What's your way of doing it?",

Anyway, I’m not a SWE but I do have a question for you engineers. \n\nIs it possible to code  using multiple languages within one program? I mean, I’m not even sure if I’m asking the question correctly, but could you code in, say, Java, but maybe a problem arises that would benefit from the use of another coding language like C+ or something? It doesn’t have to be those two languages, it’s just an example. I’m genuinely curious if that’s a thing or not or weather or not it would be beneficial for any reason. Thanks!\n\n",

        "text": "So, for the past two months I've had a number of recruiters message me telling me how they looked at my profile, liked what they saw and they are seeing if I am interested in a role that they are hiring for. The thing is I'm currently doing a coding bootcamp and I am confused as to why they would message me.\n\nLike, the closest thing to experience I have is an internship and then the coding bootcamp and that's it. I haven't even put up any of my projects that I've done so far from the bootcamp on LinkedIn. So, why is a recruiter messaging me for a job where I would make $90\\-$100k\\+ a year. It seems like these jobs would require someone with a good amount of experience, not someone who is gonna be looking for an entry/junior level job after the bootcamp.\n\nLiterally, all that's in my LinkedIn that is relevant to coding is my internship, the coding bootcamp, and a link to my Github.\n\nSome of the jobs are even with technologies that I've never even used and don't even mention in my LinkedIn profile.\n\nIs there something I'm missing or do they just message a bunch of random people they find in searches, contact them with a boilerplate message and hope that some of them would be qualified?",

Boss is getting promoted, so he needs someone to start overseeing things while he is spending more and more time away from the office being involved in more stuff. This means a minor promotion for me, while still needing to keep up on my projects/research.\n\nI have a few years of developer experience, mostly as a contractor/independent developer. I've been at my company for just under a year. I was in the military for 8 years, where I had a couple of years experience managing teams (between 4 and 20 people at different times)... And I was a terrible boss. I do NOT want to repeat those mistakes. I've learned a lot since then, made my apologies where required from back then, but I'm feeling a bit like a fish out of water with this opportunity because I know just how bad I was before.\n\nSo what books or experience or resources have you all found to be effective in learning about managing software teams? We have a couple interns, a couple full time guys, a couple who aren't geographically located, and myself. \n\nAny pointers in the right direction?",

        "text": "I am a graduate student in software engineering and I find my self in a weird spot.\n\nWhen I compare myself with my fellow students  (I have good grades) I find myself having on average better mathematical abilities, better problem solving and logically thinking skills but I lack formal knowledge of programming languages, or platforms, for example knowing libraries other than the standard ones, particular implementations of things. I find myself much more interested in the ideas behind things, how they work and being able to write them myself but I find myself losing some drive when it's a matter of knowing naming conventions and in general the \"conventional\" part of the implementation.\n\nI'm a fairly good programmer compared to my fellows in terms of being able to write algorithms, like using dynamic programming, recursion etc (I mostly know C, Java and Phyton) and for example I could write most sorting algorithms from scratch but I don't really know in which Java library they are already implemented.\n\nI do program for fun at home but even here I have done mostly things that are \"hard\" from a logical point of view (Chess engines, physics simulation) and not in the sense that you need to use various libraries and interconnect technologies as it could be writing client\\-server application.\n\nI have a good grasp of computer architecture basics, compilers etc, but even here, I can tell you how branch prediction works or how register allocation is done, but can not really name you processors on the market or how the gcc implemented it.\n\nIn terms of career I am pointing towards machine learning\\-data science but I know it's something you can not aim at right after graduation.When I think about my future I am pretty discouraged since I think that in terms of jobs those \"conventional\" skills and knowledge I talk about will be much more valued than mine so I would like to see what you think about this matters, your experiences and seeking for some advice, thank you.",

Or how it would happen than an actual answer. \n\nI started an apprenticeship 6 years ago in software engineering went to uni and got my degree as usual.\n\nDuring my time I excelled very well, while serving my apprenticeship I was always getting high props from senior managers and developers including a personal recommendation from a well respected M.D on my natural developing ablities\n\nI was head hunted and moved to london to another software house and after 6 months was promoted to lead developer but only for another 4 months until I was head hunted again for a bigger another company deeper in the heart of the capital, this promotion, was a a senior developer/team lead role.\n\nI literally have had an some amazing jumps in 5 years and worked with some of the worlds biggest blue chip clients delivering software from concept to delivery, scale and maintenance.\n\nMy question, my 5 year plan although might be highly “ambitious” I would like to move into a CTO or Head of digital role. I love development and it’s my absolute passion and hobby, I code every day I can.\nI have no intention of ever leaving this industry.\n\nHow would I plan to make the move/steps to pursue this role.

        "text": "So I got lucky and landed an internship at the first and only company I interviewed for. My First 2-3 days I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown. My mentor ran me through how to do some CRUD and then set me loose on some of my own tickets. I was so lost and honestly started to rethink my field. Hell, the other intern that started with me quit after her first 2 days! \n\nNot only was I alone and confused, but on my 3rd day they assigned me to a brand new project they were actually doing for a client. Little did I know this was a blessing in disguise. They started me from the bottom up with using .NET core (which they just started using). I created the domain models, mappings, and services before finally digging into the views and starting in on some CRUD. Now at the end of my second week I've completed a ticket that used to take me 14 hours in 3. \n\nI think learning from the bottom up and seeing how all the files communicated really helped in moving forward. I feel like I've learned more in these last 2 weeks than I have in my entire time in university. Not only this but I'm having a ton of fun doing it. I was worried that maybe SE would bore me, but I can enthusiastically say I love it. I see a lot of posts from worried college students in my situation on here and thought it would be good to make a positive post.",
