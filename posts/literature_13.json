I know some art, and I have seen my share of artwork (I know  it when I see it), but I’m not the most intelligent about it. I took an  Art Class in college (at HACC), and Amy and I did go to the Van Gogh  Interactive Experience in Philadelphia this year – but still, my  knowledge and understanding of art is pretty limited. I can understand  (or guess) some symbols and meaning, but a lot will go over my head. I  will freely admit all of this.  \n\n\nSo books like this and The  Essential Pablo Picasso and other art themed books I’ve been reading  this year and the past two or three years, have been my attempts to  educate myself a bit more on the subject. This is a great little, quick,  easy read that helped me better understand Salvador Dali himself, and  his artwork. It gives a run down of his life, as well as little off  topic – but related – subject interests like his friendship with Lorca,  his wife Gala, his homelife growing up, his place of birth, the  Surrealism movement itself, etc. There is also artwork on nearly every  other page with descriptions of the piece of work as well, which also  helps get a better understanding of Dali and his works.  \n\n\nThis was  written (by Robert Goff) by someone who loves / loved and enjoys /  enjoyed Salvador Dali and his works. Its not biased though, and doesn’t  come off as a fanboy gushing; but as a descriptive look back over his  life and works, but the ending shows why the author thinks that Dali is  still worth considering, looking at, and appreciating; versus how some  like Breton say he’s not worth looking into (and thats most likely due  to personal reasons from Dali’s falling out with the Surrealism  group)......  \n\n\nYou can read the full book review here:  \n\n\nBook Review: The Essential Salvador Dali (Robert Goff)  \n[https://thebeerthrillers.com/2022/12/...](https://thebeerthrillers.com/2022/12/11/book-review-the-essential-salvador-dali-robert-goff/)",

        "author": "raspberryappeal23",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/zihfdo/what_was_miltons_point_in_paradise_lost/",
        "text": "I've just been assigned to write an essay on Paradise Lost for a literature class and I can't make sense of what Milton's point is here. I'm confused and would love some discussion to help me figure out my thoughts.\n\nFrom what I know, Milton believed in patriarchy, or that humankind has a biological hierarchy that places women as inferior to men. However, the more I analyze Paradise Lost, the more it seems like he doesn't believe that at all... I'm not sure how to write an essay that would be arguing something completely contrary to what the author himself is said to have believed.\n\nAdam was essentially a great candidate for Satan's manipulation. When he and Eve first wake up in Eden, Milton explicitly states that Adam's first desire was a bunch of tempting looking apples (Adam literally wakes up, wanders around, sees apples, and thinks about how tempting they are and how he'd like to eat them). In fact, one could argue that he parallels Satan more than Eve does because he's directly inferior to God, even though Eve is also an inferior. Up until the point that Eve desires to be equals with Adam and so eats the apple, Adam is the one who keeps asking questions in pursuit of knowledge. The only time that we see Eve being curious to an extent is when she sees Satan in the form of a snake and wonders at how he can speak and reason, and that's when she starts to feel like maybe knowledge will help her become equals with Adam.\n\nTo my confusion -- Adam and Eve are actually quite similar, with Adam seeming like a more manipulatable candidate early on and Eve only becoming one after we find out that she doesn't like feeling inferior to Adam. There's nothing about her that actually indicates there's something inherently sinful about her that led her to eat the apple; even her vanity, which is \"sinful,\" is hardly any different than Adam's superficiality every time he looks at Eve and goes, \"wow she's so hot.\" This makes me feel like Milton is making an extremely radical point about the role God plays in Eve's \"sin\"; essentially, that Eve would not have so easily succumbed to Satan had she only been placed as equal to Adam. Additionally, Eve is not actually as vain as she seems; while she enjoys Satan's flattery and thinks her reflection is pretty, she still acknowledges that Adam's wisdom and knowledge are more valuable, and believes that her lack of knowledge is what makes her inferior.\n\nSo...\n\nAnyway, my confusion here is that Milton was supposed to be a man of faith, and believed in the gender hierarchy, but Paradise Lost seems to argue something completely different. I'd like to write a paper on how Milton makes an argument for how God played a large role in mankind's fall, but that also doesn't seem to align with his actual beliefs. So what in the world am I supposed to be reading from this epic?\n\n**TL;DR** Confused about the point of Paradise Lost since Milton was supposed to be religious and sexist. Everything in the epic seems to be like an argument against God and against the gender hierarchy. How are readers supposed to interpret this?",

        "text": "The poetry book that brought me the most pleasure this year was Martyn Crucefix's translations of the  poetry of German writer Peter Huchel (the 'u' is pronounced like the 'oo' in moon).  Huchel was kept under house arrest by the East German government for years; the poems written during that period have a special resonance in light of our own recent lockdowns. When the world closes in, perspectives change in surprising ways, and some things may become clearer.\n\nInterested to hear what poetic discoveries other readers have made this year.",

        "text": "Where to begin? I have asked myself this question dozens of times, gazing at  a blank page. As if I needed to find the one, the only sentence that would give me entry into the writing of the book and remove all doubts in one fell swoop – a sort of key. Today, as I confront a situation which, the initial stupor having passed – ‘is it really me this is happening to?’ – my imagination represents in a way that instils a growing terror, I am overwhelmed by the same necessity. Finding the sentence that will give me the freedom and the firmness to speak without trembling in this place to which you have invited me this evening. To find that sentence, I don’t have to look very far. It instantly appears. In all its clarity and violence. Lapidary. Irrefutable. Written in my diary sixty years ago. ‘I will write to avenge my people, j’écrirai pour venger ma race’.  It echoed Rimbaud’s cry: ‘I am of an inferior race for all eternity.’ I was twenty-two, studying literature in a provincial faculty with the daughters and sons of the local bourgeoisie, for the most part. I proudly and naively believed that writing books, becoming a writer, as the last in a line of landless labourers, factory workers and shopkeepers, people despised for their manners, their accent, their lack of education, would be enough to redress the social injustice linked to social class at birth. That an individual victory could erase centuries of domination and poverty, an illusion that school had already fostered in me by dint of my academic success. How could my personal achievement have redeemed any of the humiliations and offences suffered? That’s not a question I ever asked myself. I had a few excuses. From the time I could read, books were my companions, and reading was my natural occupation outside of school. This appetite was nurtured by a mother who, between customers, in her shop, read a great many novels, and preferred me reading rather than sewing and knitting. The high cost of books, the suspicion with which they were regarded at my religious school, made them even more desirable. Don Quixote, Gulliver’s Travels, Jane Eyre,  the tales of Grimm and Andersen, David Copperfield, Gone with the Wind, and later Les Misérables, The Grapes of Wrath, Nausea, The Stranger: chance, more than the school’s prescriptions, determined what I read.  By choosing literary studies I elected to remain inside literature, which had become the thing of greatest value, even a way of life that led me to project myself into the novels of Flaubert or Virginia Woolf and literally live them out. Literature was a sort of continent which I unconsciously set in opposition to my social environment. And I conceived of writing as nothing less than the possibility of transfiguring reality.  It was not the rejection of my first novel by two or three publishers –  a novel whose sole merit was its attempt to find a new form – which subdued my desire and my pride. It was life situations in which the weight of difference between a woman’s existence and that of a man was keenly felt in a society where roles were defined by gender, where contraception was prohibited and termination of pregnancy a crime. Married with two children, a teaching position and full responsibility for household affairs, each day I moved further and further away from writing and my promise to avenge my people. I could not read the parable ‘Before the Law’ from Kafka’s The Trial without seeing the shape of my own destiny: to die without ever having entered the gate made just for me, the book that only I could write. But that is without taking account of private and historical circumstance. The death of a father who passed away three days after I arrived home on holiday, a job teaching students from working-class backgrounds similar to my own, protest movements everywhere in the world: all these factors brought me back, through byroads that were unforeseen and proximate to the world of my origins, to my ‘people’, and gave my desire to write a quality of secret and absolute urgency. No more of the illusory ‘writing about nothing’ of my twenties; now it was a matter of delving into the unspeakable in repressed memory, and bringing light to bear on how my people lived. Of writing to understand the reasons, inside and outside of myself, which had caused me  to be distanced from my origins. \n\nIn writing, no choice is self-evident. But those who, as immigrants,  no longer speak their parents’ language, and those who, as class defectors, no longer have quite the same language, think and express themselves with other words, face additional hurdles. A dilemma. They indeed feel the difficulty, even the impossibility of writing in the acquired, dominant language, which they have mastered and admire in works of literature, anything that relates  to their world of origin, that first world made up of sensations and words describing daily life, work, one’s place in society. On the one hand is the language in which they learned to name things, with its brutality and silences, for example that of the intimate exchange between a mother and a son in the very beautiful text by Albert Camus, ‘Between Yes and No’. On the other hand are the models of admired, internalized works which made that first world open out and to which they feel indebted for their elevation; which they sometimes even considered their true homeland. Mine included Flaubert, Proust, Virginia Woolf. None of them, when I went back to writing, were of any help to me. I had to break with ‘writing well’ and beautiful sentences – the very kind I taught my students to write – to root out, display and understand the rift running through me. What came to me spontaneously was the clamour of a language which conveyed anger and derision, even crudeness; a language of excess, insurgent, often used by the humiliated and offended as their only response to the memory of others’ contempt, of shame and shame at feeling shame. Very quickly too, it seemed self-evident – to the point that I could not imagine any other way to start – to anchor the story of the rift in my social being in the situation that had been mine as a student, a revolting situation  to which the French state still condemned women, the need to seek out clandestine terminations at the hands of backstreet abortionists. And I wanted to describe everything that had happened to my girl’s body; the discovery of pleasure, periods. And so, without being aware of it at the time, that first book, published in 1974, mapped out the realm in which I would situate my writing, a realm both social and feminist. Avenging my people and avenging my sex would, from that time on, be one and the same thing. \n\nHow can one reflect on life without also reflecting on writing? Without wondering whether writing reinforces or disrupts the accepted, interiorized representations of beings and things? With its violence and derision, did insurgent writing not reflect the attitude of the dominated? When the reader was culturally privileged, he maintained the same imposing and condescending outlook on a character in a book as he would in real life. Therefore, originally, it was to elude this kind of gaze which, when directed at my father whose story I was going to tell, would have been unbearable and,  I felt, a betrayal, that, starting with my fourth book, I adopted a neutral, objective kind of writing, ‘flat’ in the sense that it contained neither metaphors nor signs of emotion. The violence was no longer displayed; it came from the facts themselves and not the writing. Finding the words that contain both reality and the sensation provided by reality would become, and remain to this day, my ongoing concern in writing, no matter what the subject. It was necessary for me to continue to say ‘I’. In literary use, the first person – the one through which we exist, in most languages, from the moment we know how to speak until death – is often considered narcissistic when referring to the author rather than an ‘I’ presented as fictitious. It is worth remembering that the ‘I’, hitherto the privilege of nobles recounting feats of arms in memoirs, was in France a democratic conquest of the eighteenth century, the affirmation of the equality of individuals and the right to be the subject of their story, as claimed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in this first preamble to the Confessions: ‘And let no one object that, being a man of the people, I have nothing to say that deserves the attention of readers. [...] In whatever obscurity I may have lived, if I thought more and better than the Kings, the story of my soul is more interesting than that of theirs.’ It was not this plebeian pride that motivated me (although, having said that…), but the desire to use the ‘I’ – a form both masculine and feminine – as an exploratory tool that captures sensations: those which memory has buried, those which the world around us keeps on giving, everywhere and all the time. The prerequisite of sensation has for me become both the guide and guarantee of the authenticity of my research. But to what end? Not to tell the story of my  life nor free myself of its secrets but to decipher a lived situation, an event,  a romantic relationship, and thereby reveal something that only writing can bring into being and perhaps pass on to the consciousness and memories of others. Who could say that love, pain and mourning, shame, are not universal? Victor Hugo wrote: ‘Not one of us has the honour of living a life that is only his own.’ But as all things are lived inexorably in the individual mode – ‘it is to me this is happening’ – they can only be read in the same way if the ‘I’ of the book becomes transparent, in a sense, and the ‘I’ of the reader comes to occupy it. If this ‘I’, to put it another way, becomes transpersonal.  This is how I conceived my commitment to writing, which does not consist of writing ‘for’ a category of readers, but in writing ‘from’ my experience as a woman and an immigrant of the interior; and from my longer and longer memory of the years I have lived, and from the present, an endless provider of the images and words of others. This commitment through which  I pledge myself in writing is supported by the belief, which has become a certainty, that a book can contribute to change in private life, help to shatter the loneliness of experiences endured and repressed, and enable beings to reimagine themselves. When the unspeakable is brought to light, it is political. We see it today in the revolt of women who have found the words to disrupt male power and who have risen up, as in Iran, against its most archaic form. Writing in a democratic country, however, I continue to wonder about the place women occupy in the literary field. They have not yet gained legitimacy as producers of written works. There are men in the world, including the Western intellectual spheres, for whom books written by women simply do not exist; they never cite them. The recognition of my work by the Swedish Academy is a sign of hope for all female writers.  In the bringing to light of the social unspeakable, of those internalized power relations linked to class and/or race, and gender too, felt only by the people who directly experience their impact, the possibility of individual but also collective emancipation emerges. To decipher the real world by stripping it of the visions and values that language, all language, carries within it is to upend its established order, upset its hierarchies. \nBut I do not confuse the political action of literary writing, subject to its reception by the reader, with the positions I feel compelled to take with respect to events, conflicts and ideas. I grew up as part of the post-war generation, following World War II, when writers and intellectuals positioned themselves in relation to French politics and became involved in social struggles as a matter of course. Today, it is impossible to say whether things would have turned out differently had they not spoken out and committed themselves. In today’s world, where the multiplicity of information sources and the speed at which images flash past condition a form of indifference,  to focus on one’s art is a temptation. But, meanwhile, in Europe, an ideology of withdrawal and closure is on the rise, still concealed by the violence of an imperialist war waged by the dictator at the head of Russia, and steadily gaining ground in hitherto democratic countries. Founded on the exclusion of foreigners and immigrants, the abandonment of the economically weak, the surveillance of women’s bodies, this ideology requires a duty of extreme vigilance, for me and all those for whom the value of a human being is always and everywhere the same. By granting me the highest literary distinction that can be, a bright light is being shone on work that consists of writing and personal research carried out in solitude and doubt. This light does not dazzle me. I do not regard as an individual victory the Nobel prize that has been awarded me. It is neither from pride nor modesty that I see it, in some sense, as a collective victory. I share the pride of it with those who, in one way or another, hope for greater freedom, equality and dignity for all humans, regardless of their sex or gender, the colour of their skin, and their culture; and with those who think of future generations, of safeguarding an Earth where a profit-hungry few make life increasingly unliveable for all populations. If I look back on the promise made at twenty to avenge my people,  I cannot say whether I have carried it out. It was from this promise, and from my forebears, hardworking men and women inured to tasks that caused them to die early, that I received enough strength and anger to have the desire and ambition to give them a place in literature, amid this ensemble of voices which, from very early on, accompanied me, giving me access to other worlds and other ways of being, including that of rebelling against and wanting to change it, in order to inscribe my voice as a woman and a social defector in what still presents itself as a space of emancipation, literature.",

        "text": "I enjoyed reading *Anne of the Green Gables*,  as many other novels of the same era. At the same time, I suspect that, if I or someone was writing with such a style today, or, as I wouldn’t dare to compare my abilities to such an author, I should say with the same choice of third person omniscient, detailed descriptions, these figures of speech and a slow start, the novel would not pass today's filter of the agent or publisher, because of this choice.\nMaybe even I, I wouldn't venture reading this kind of prose from a modern writer with the same ease and confidence than if they were from the previous century.\n\nIt's as if in one case the old novel has the credit from the author's fame, or its own fame, plus some extenuating circumstances due to its old age. And conversely the modern writer's novel suffers a prejudice from the suspicion of not being able to keep up-to-date with the craft, or of trying to imitate the old style, thus being an amateur's work in both cases.\n\nOf course it's a bit exaggerated and this leaves aside the pure talent, the \"divine spark\" which is the base that produces the artistic value. And several genres accept a proven “old style”, I guess (fantasy?) \n\n\nBut, still, I can't help thinking a bit this way and I couldn't find anything conclusive about it online. \n\n\nI expected to find someone explaining, for example, that in romance genre the tastes has changed and we no longer write like this, and a novel in old style would not sell well, but it the fantasy genre this is still the main approach, etc.\n\nAll this is a fuzzy impression I have, I never studied literature, so maybe it’s obvious or easy to answer for you. This is closely related to the history of literature, plus a question about your personal stance and feelings.\n\nReaders tastes and preferences (or demands?) have changed, authors no longer write like this, and yet the old stack of hits still sells well. Is it because their exceptional talent completely offset what could drive away readers? Or is it what I described? (not belittling the talent either)",
