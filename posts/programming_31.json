        "text": "Hey everyone, I recently started a sales role with a large software company (publicly traded, #1 competitor to Microsoft) selling software to software programmers (architects, developers, operations, security). I‚Äôm having a very very hard time prospecting to these personas as no one seems to pick up their phones at all or reply to emails. \n\nCan anyone describe to me how they would like to be sold (I know no one does) but at least how to maybe get you interested in a conversation and to chat about your projects and tooling at your current organization.\n\nI‚Äôm of course writing this to get insight on how software people think and where they may spend time. Yes the stereotype is that sales people are sleezy and just trying to rip people off but my view is that we can help to put a product in your eyes that may help you with some challenges in your role. I‚Äôm obviously stressed as I did not anticipate selling to IT/software professionals to be such a challenge. I would appreciate any advice as to how software professionals would like to potentially get sold and in what is the best way to reach out (email, calls, LinkedIn).\n\nThanks for listening to this rant, happy Saturday",
