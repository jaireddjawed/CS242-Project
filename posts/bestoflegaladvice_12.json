It was recently brought to my attention that I have ~~not been abusing my mod power enough~~ been drinking for the past couple hours, so I get to create my very own contest this week. So, think about all the \"once there was an old man from.... and \"there once was a girl from...; and ruin my affinity for them forever. Write about posts, tree law, MS paint, how wonderful the mod team is, u/demyst mo- uh, favorite footsball team, The Packets with their Point Guard Roger Aaron.   \n\nSo let's hear what you can come up with. Prize is, as always, username flair. I think I might have a code worth $2 off your first Amazon Now in my spam folder, or maybe free delivery from some obscure waffle-oil change Fusion Boutique in PDX to throw in as well. Since I got to judge last time, I will pass that torch to u/bug-hunter and special guest judge /u/TitchyBeacher, without whom I might have forgotten to post this again this week. Eh, who am I kidding? I will totally  also be handing out prizes like kleenex at a snot party this time. \n\n\nReady, steady, GO!   \n   \n\nEdit: Sunday 9/16 evening. I have gone through and added a bunch of username flair, largely by stealing the best lines from your poems. Or poking at usernames. I will still be reading new posts as long as the post exists and adding flair at my whimsy, as will the other mods. If you really hate your new flair (unless it is literally bearable), you can send me (eeech, not modmail) a PM and I might agree to swap it.  \n\n\nThank you EVERYONE for all of these awesome limericks. These are all amazing. I was under the weather this weekend and it was so fun to read them. \n\n\nEdit Monday afternoon - So yeah, there are some issues with new reddit and adding flair, so lots of them didn't \"take\" yesterday. I just went back through on a different browser and \\*\\*think\\*\\* it worked, but if not, please reply or PM me and we will get you fixed up.\n\n\nEdit III - Somewhat later on Monday afternoon. OK, so that also didn't work. So I just went into old reddit and manually added flair to everyone who wrote a poem. If I missed you, or you find yours too unbearable, message me and I'll hook you up. \n\nEdit IV: I have no idea what happened to the post formatting, but I fixed it. Or if I didn't, I just stopped caring. ",
