        "text": "During the coronavirus lockdown I dedicated myself to learning Spanish, studying about 1-2 hours per day. Within 1 year I was quite fluent, able to have proper conversations with native speakers on any topic, watch movies, read books, etc. I passed a B2 test and was probably closer to C1. Although my Spanish has declined from lack of practice, I'm still conversational and watch stuff in Spanish occasionally.\n\nRecently I took up Russian, and was filled with confidence after my studies in Spanish.\n\nUnfortunately, Russian appears to be WAY more difficult than Spanish. There are way less words which are similar to my native English, more complicated spelling rules, and way more things to memorise like the stress on each word and when to use \"o\" or \"a\". A few months into Spanish and I was already speaking, but after over a month of studying Russian I barely know the Cyrillic alphabet and still struggle with basic spelling and grammar rules.\n\nI didn't expect the difficulty to be so dramatic between these two languages, and it's clear Russian is much more of a challenge for a native English speaker than Spanish/Portuguese/French/Italian/German/etc.\n\nAny tips or activities I should do in order to help my fluency for Russian? I'm currently speaking with an iTalki tutor once per week who teaches me Russian grammar while explaining in Spanish (laddering). Also, every day I'm using Flashcards of minimal pairs and spelling rules (Fluent Forever method). I've brought a couple of books on Russian grammar too",

        "text": "I'm a fairly dedicated Krashenite - I believe that comprehensible input is really the only way to acquire a language. I had a poor experience in school as a language learner. As an adult I  learned two languages by listening and reading.\n\nI decided to become a languages teacher, hoping that I could do a better job than the teachers who taught me. I'd have students read and listen to a lot of comprehensible input in the language, and they would acquire the language naturally. \n\nNow I'm actually teaching, my ideals are hitting a few barriers, some of them systematic, and some to do with the students themselves. \n\nThe first is curricular: I've tried to adapt it as best I can, but the content (narrow, and with some very specific expectations of what students ought to be able to do) makes this difficult. It is especially difficult to make it *interesting* and I'm increasing falling back on resources designed to just hammer textbook phrases into the students' heads. \n\nSecond is testing: Students are tested on a very narrow range of vocabulary. They are more likely to pass their tests if they just study flashcards. If the students fail exams, they feel bad (and I look bad) so   they end up studying with flashcards. \n\nThirdly (and most surprising to me) is students' attitudes. My youngest students are very enthusiastic, and have a high-tolerance for reading and listening in the target language, working through ambiguity, and enjoy speaking and creating stories in the language. But the older students fall into two categories: \n\n*The majority, non-academic* \\- Jaded, cynical of the subject, and with low self-confidence in their ability. They have extremely low tolerance for ambiguity when listening and reading in the target language. They have little to no willingness to participate. They think they are adults already, so they don't want to learn through silly stories, but they don't have the ability to read serious content in the language, either. Many have had poor experiences with previous teachers.\n\n*The minority, academic -* Students that would pass whether or not I were teaching them. Also very little tolerance for learning through content. Top-down learners, they prefer to have a rule which they can apply, or a list of vocabulary to memorise. Will pass their tests easily, but will not *acquire* the language in any meaningful sense. \n\nI also work at a school where behaviour and compliance is really poor, which compounds a lot of these issues and means that I've just turned into a taskmaster, dishing out work and making sure students complete it.\n\nI'm sort of losing my reason to be in the profession.  \n\n\nTL;DR - Is comprehensible input actually possible in a real classroom environment?",

So, my question(s) to you all:\n\n* Is there any evidence of this phenomenon existing in Spanish?  Is it perhaps dialectal?\n* Does this reflect a sort of artificial \"disambiguating\" usage to clarify potential confusion between past/present, the same way I've heard Spanish speakers artificially contrast &lt;b&gt; and &lt;v&gt; as /b/ and /v/ (despite there being otherwise no productive phonemic distinction between the two)?\n* Do you know of any other examples of this in Spanish or any other languages, where typically identical verb forms may be artificially distinguished in speech?",

To start this post, I want to establish that I did this for fun and because I‚Äôm broke until Saturday. I have a job that allows me to study for just about a full 8 hours a day while working (if I have the energy), and I normally use most of it for Spanish comprehensive input, chemistry lectures, or philosophy audiobooks. I have ADHD and it is hard for me to do the tasks I do at work without something else to focus on.  \nThis week I chose to study German and French, two languages to which my only exposure was a single preparatory listen to the respective Language Transfer courses, and whatever terms I‚Äôve had to learn in my academic career. I decided that my goal would be listening to the first 30 lessons of each language, focusing on German before lunch and French after lunch because my exposure to Spanish made me catch on to French a bit quicker towards the end of the work day, when I would be a bit more tired.  \nI started last Saturday and focused a bit more on German than French at the beginning, but feel as if I‚Äôve learned a lot over these last few days. By the end of the work day today, I‚Äôve finished 40 German lessons and 33 French lessons, and I have a few minutes left on my free trial.  \nOverall, I‚Äôd review pimsleur as being pretty good for beginning to learn a language, especially when it comes to pronunciation. I haven‚Äôt learned much grammar explicitly at this point, but I don‚Äôt expect that will ever be introduced in the remaining 100 episodes or so left. I‚Äôve tried listening to some A-level and B-level comprehensible input in the evenings throughout the week, and I feel as if large chunks of information are being understood after finishing the first level of each course. It will be a long time before I am conversational as I don‚Äôt expect to keep up this pace, but I plan on continuing with Pimsleur.  \nI didn‚Äôt really plan on making a post about this and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really useful information for anyone, but I am proud of myself for sticking with my goal and wanted to share.",

Since a lot of the song titles got translated into English I just naturally picked up random Finnish words. \nI started dabbling a bit more in 2020. I definitely wasn‚Äôt trying to be consistent. Since I‚Äôve been super bored lately, I ‚Äúofficially‚Äù started last week. I can‚Äôt exactly say I‚Äôve been studying for a week, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been studying for twelve years or even three years either.

For words that use the hook (  Ãâ ) or tilde  ( ~ ), I bob my head a bit forward and back to recall the descending to ascending tone. \n\nMy wife, who speaks Vietnamese as her first language, is thankful that my ability to communicate in Vietnamese has increased, but can‚Äôt help but laugh because of the gestures I feel compelled to make to remember the tones. \n\nHas anyone found helpful ways to learn tones?

I remember in my master's program when we would be translating and using special applications on the laptop that our professor who had a thinkpad let us know it would be harder for those of us with macs. I have a mac laptop, and Ipad. However, that was in 2017 and now it's 2023 so things might have improved on that end.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/10yio9u/the_hallmark_of_the_advanced_language_learner_or/",
        "text": "TLDR: That hallmark is the ability to understand and deal with multiple registers. What is a register? Here are some examples in Spanish. Learning from multiple registers over time is variety, and variety is essential to language-learning success.\n\nWhile considering some of the abilities of the advanced learner of a foreign language--and I take advanced here to mean the C-levels according to the CEFR or roughly ILR level 4/ACTFL Superior/Distinguished according to the American system--and after reading large amounts of text and manuals from the above bodies and organizations, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that the most distinguishing trait of the learner at the advanced levels is that the linguistic repertoire includes an ability not only to comprehend the multiple registers of the language, but also to deploy them as needed. Knowledge and use of these registers also presupposes a certain amount of cultural knowledge embedded in the language in question, and there isn‚Äôt a truly advanced student of a foreign language who doesn‚Äôt have much of their linguistic knowledge bound up with the culture. To know a language well is to know the culture of that language.\n\nKeep in mind that by *register* I don‚Äôt mean dialect, but instead the designation of a kind of language common to a given social or cultural sphere of activity, i.e. a low register, a formal register, a colloquial register, an academic register, etc. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that, as a student of a foreign language, being able to navigate multiple registers is not only an essential skill, but also the determinant of your flexibility in the language, your ability to blend in with the culture, to be native to some degree (and please disregard the inevitable controversy associated with the whole idea of being native, since it‚Äôs beside the point here).\n\nAccording to the FSI (Foreign Service Institute) in conjunction with the ratings provided by the ILR, or Interagency Language Roundtable, [this important hallmark of the Level 4 mentioned](https://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/FSI/Testing%20Kit/FSI%20-%20Testing%20Kit%20French%20and%20Spanish.pdf) above is brought up in a self-appraisal checklist of speaking proficiency: **‚ÄúAre you able to alter your speech deliberately, depending upon whether you are talking to university professors, close friends, employees, etc.?‚Äù** As I‚Äôve been arguing here, I‚Äôd say that this is not just one of the important hallmarks of the level but, as indicated by the title, THE hallmark of an advanced learner. But it‚Äôs obviously debatable and, to the degree that it is, unimportant. The important point is that it‚Äôs at least one of the most critical factors for the advanced levels, and it can‚Äôt be overlooked.\n\nThat‚Äôs where the word ***variety*** comes in, and my notion of variety is that it encapsulates a strategy of long-term language learning: it is, in essence, learning from multiple registers over time and using these multiple registers as a pathway toward the advanced levels in a foreign language.\n\nWith that theory out of the way, I wanted to describe a brief list of registers as applied to the Spanish language. In that way, I‚Äôm hoping that everyone can see in this post both the theory (above) and the practice (below) so that the ideas become crystal-clear.\n\nNote that this list of Spanish registers is meant to be my particular application of the above ideas, and that I‚Äôve created it from my own extensive but idiosyncratic experience with the Spanish language, of which I‚Äôm a genuinely advanced student certified by the relevant body that you‚Äôll find in my flair. That personal experience is why you‚Äôll find that most of these examples are from European Spanish, the chosen variety/culture that is inextricable from my knowledge of the language, but they can easily be applied to any other language. And as a final disclaimer, I'd like to say that *this list is not exhaustive, and I‚Äôm not a professional linguist. I make no assertions of completeness. This is, instead, an attempt at a general outline. Please note that some of the character quotations are paraphrases.* \n\n  \nSome Different Registers of (European) Spanish\n\n**Register 1**: *Low Slang, Profanity, and an Endless Array of Vulgar Insults*\n\n¬∑ In Spain (or at least in the area of Madrid), this would be the language you‚Äôd find in general currency among pretty much any group of native speakers; even if the person in question isn‚Äôt inclined to use it, they would certainly understand it (and it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be pleasing to the ear, though it could be hilarious). A perfect example would be the kind of language used by the *portero* Emilio in the Spanish series *Aqu√≠ no hay quien viva*.\n\no **Examples**: ‚ÄúQue te den morcilla‚Äù, ‚ÄúMe la suda‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo me jodas‚Äù, ‚Äúm√©tetelo donde te quepa‚Äù, ‚Äúa tomar por culo‚Äù, and words like *guarra*, *golfa*, *chulo*, *maric√≥n*, *julay*, etc.\n\n  \n**Register 2**: *Colloquial and Informal Language, and Frequent Everyday Usages*\n\n¬∑ This is the kind of language you‚Äôd find in normal conversations if, say, you‚Äôre at the supermarket or talking among friends (most of the time). It also has a beautiful expressive range, from low insult (without dipping into the truly vulgar) to something eloquent, radiant, and everything in between. Most of the characters on *Aqu√≠ no hay quien viva* use this kind of language most of the time.\n\no **Examples** (just a few here at random, because this is a huge category): ‚ÄúNo me he intentado escaquear de nada‚Äù, ‚Äúse ha frotado las manos‚Äù, ‚Äúse me ha ido de las manos‚Äù, ‚Äúparece mentira que‚Ä¶‚Äù, \"se le ha ido la pinza/la olla\", ‚ÄúNo se ha enterado de nada‚Äù, ‚Äúponerse en la piel de‚Ä¶‚Äù, etc.\n\n  \n**Register 3**: *Elevated or Formal Language and Educated Usages*\n\n¬∑ A good example of this would be the character Juan Cuesta in *Aqu√≠ no hay quien viva*: he‚Äôs an aging schoolteacher, educated and articulate, almost never vulgar verbally, but the show‚Äôs running gag is that he uses this register almost all the time, almost as part of his personality, and he comes off as a prig, pretentious, and generally unlikeable. And very often brilliantly funny.\n\no **Examples**: ‚Äú¬øQu√© es lo que opinas sobre el papel que tiene China como potencia econ√≥mica a nivel mundial?‚Äù, ‚ÄúImpugno la junta‚Äù, (looking at a chart explaining fetal development in a doctor‚Äôs office) ‚ÄúEs una maravilla ver c√≥mo el feto, en su desarrollo morfol√≥gico, empieza a dar sus primeros saltos vitales‚Äù, ‚Äú¬øNo ser√≠a mejor que soslay√°semos estos peque√±os percances para llegar a un acuerdo mutuo?‚Äù\n\n  \n**Register 4**: *Academic and Literary Language*\n\n¬∑ These are obviously somewhat different, but I‚Äôm putting them together because they both use a special and often highly formal register distinct from the day-to-day stuff that you‚Äôll see on television or while shopping, talking with friends and family, etc. It is rarely, in other words, what's found in your local pub.\n\no **Examples**: Lots of field-specific terminology, the use of the pronoun *cuyo* in uninterrupted speech patterns/constructions, some low-frequency connectors like ‚Äúpor mor de‚Äù or ‚Äúde suerte que‚Äù, a huge number of low-frequency verbs and words/set phrases like *can√≠cula*, *vilipendiar*, *escarabajear*, *proceloso*, *tiempo ha*, *dantesco*, *motu proprio* (a Latinism), *fuero interno*, etc.\n\n  \n**Register 5**: *Ceremonial or Parliamentary Language*\n\n¬∑ The register in which *usted* occurs with the highest frequency. Formal, almost stilted usage, backed by what are probably centuries of linguistic custom. Largely confined to formal speeches or arguments and rebuttals in parliamentary discussions.\n\no Examples: Heavy use of usted, words of address like *se√±or√≠a* and expressions such as ‚Äúusted tiene la palabra‚Äù, things like ‚Äúenmiendas constitucionales‚Äù and lots of hand-waving, use of a microphone, and performative gestures meant for the public eye.\n\n  \nObviously there are more registers than the ones listed, but this has taken long enough and I‚Äôd like to stop now. With all these registers, I can conclude by saying again that ***variety***, as mentioned in the title, is the ability to learn from the multiple registers of your target language over time (often a long time), so that it becomes a pathway toward a varied, robust, and rich linguistic repertoire that is, by definition, that of an advanced learner. Variety, to my mind, is the most important factor in reaching advanced proficiency in a foreign language.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure whether this will be of any use to anyone, but it‚Äôs been useful to me on my language-learning journey and it‚Äôs obviously pertinent to the subject matter of this forum. So that‚Äôs all for now. Best of luck to everyone! Sobre todo, si has le√≠do hasta el final, much√≠simas gracias y adi√≥s.",

They are great value for money and it‚Äôs close to my work and fits in with my schedule. \n\nThe classes are organised by one lady, I‚Äôll call her Sensei. But it is a large group of Japanese volunteers (that aren‚Äôt necessarily teachers) teaching individual foreigners in one room. It‚Äôs great because each student gets their needs met. When one starts the class you‚Äôre with Sensei for the first couple months on the beginners book. Then once you move on she‚Äôll assign you one or two teachers. This is what happened to me. I now have K san on Wednesday and Iri-san on Fridays. K san is an old dude who speaks a little fast but he‚Äôs super diligent in correcting me - he also always brings me print outs and tests my grammar. I come away feeling accomplished somehow. \n\nIri-san is a lawyer, she‚Äôs very nice and sweet but she doesn‚Äôt often correct me when I‚Äôm speaking. She often just nods in understanding me but won‚Äôt correct me. The more frustrating thing is that she doesn‚Äôt have any structure for the class. When our chat comes to a natural end there‚Äôs always a silence that feel awkward and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúurmmmm‚Äù and plays with her planner and pen. Then she or I will ask more questions to fill the silence. I often come out feeling like I didn‚Äôt learn anything. \n\nWhen this started happening I decided to have extra private lessons with Sensei on Mondays as she‚Äôs a very good teacher. \n\nIs there anything you guys could recommend I do regarding Iri-san? Would it be rude for me to suggest some structure to her? Should I say something to Sensei? \n\nMany thanks.",
