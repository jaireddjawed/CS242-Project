        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nI live in an area where pets get lost very frequently.  The neighborhoods around me are majority senior living and assisted living facilities and 55+ communities. \n\nI often come across lost pets, mostly dogs and the occasional cat, and have about a 50/50 success rate at catching them. I use to volunteer at animal shelters so I know a lot about animal handling, but not in an uncontrolled environment. It depends a lot on the temperament and the situation. \n\nThese pets I come across are very blatantly loved - collars and well-groomed coats, and usually on the chunkier side. Tonight I came across a beautiful pup on my way home. He was full sprinting down the street, and I tried following slowly in my car and then on foot once I realized that freaked him out even more. I tried calming him down by crouching to his level and gently talking to and encouraging him, but nothing helped. He kept looking back, stopping for a moment, and then sprinted again. I attempted to earn his trust and get close enough to him as possible for about 20 minutes when someone revved their engine on the road over and he bolted.  Poor pup rounded a corner and was gone, I couldn't find him for the life of me. \n\nAfter another 15 minutes of searching under cars and in bushes in the dark, I went home. I can't stop crying because I truly wanted to help this animal, but I had nothing around me that could have helped in this situation. \n\nShould I keep certain items in my car? I'm thinking of a loop leash and treats, but obviously there's more to it than that. Is there certain body language and techniques I should follow? I felt so helpless tonight and I want to do my best to help these animals the best i can. \n\nThank you in advance",

You can then try to determine which category you fall into, and look into specific treatments from there. You may still encounter some scams or faulty products, but you're far more likely to find an actual solution.",

Well, by doing the bi-weekly payment option, I cut my mortgage payment in half, and it allows me to have more breathing room to get through the month!\n\nJust thought I would share this in case any of you find yourselves a little more strapped for cash when the mortgage payment is due.",
