Yet there's no kind of 911 call or police cars even if he's killing and shooting in broad daylight. \n\nIn chapter 2, wicks kills on Subway system. Unmasked face and in public.

Every scene is beautiful and I’ve read a lot about all the technical aspects that went into filming it. So yes, I totally understand why the making of the film and the quality of production is heralded. \n\nWhat I don’t understand is why people like the actual story so much. I’ve read reviews where people said they sobbed at times in the film, that they were so engrossed, that they’ve seen it multiple times, and that the story is so ingenious. \n\nAnd I feel like I’m definitely missing something. To me, the story itself felt so boring. I kept waiting for something to happen, but the character was not engaging at all. His “rise” and “fall” elicited no emotion from me. I understand Barry isn’t supposed to be this typical protagonist that we root for and that we are supposed to feel detached from him. But, regardless I felt like no part or subtlety of the story justified the run time. \n\nSo, is there something that I’m missing that makes this movie so appealing besides the technical quality?",

This clip from the fabulous movie *Margin Call* is of a broker moving his inventory after learning that the firm will likely be out of business by the end of the day if he doesn't unload a bunch of stuff that is about to lose a lot of value. Not a quaver or hint of fear in his voice as he sells millions of dollars of soon to be worthless paper. \n\nAs soon as there were rumours that SVB was in trouble, everyone in real life reacted just like the people in the movie - \"Me first\". Fear and greed are powerful motivators. In *It's A Wonderful Life*, Jimmy Stewart was able to talk the people of a small town into hanging together during tough times. In *Margin Call*, we see that there is no loyalty at all to people you only meet on phone calls and Zoom.",

What an amazing, captivating performance. And all the more impressive because he came out of nowhere, having had some stage roles and a few minor film roles before Pulp Fiction. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and the award went to Martin Landau for Ed Wood. I love that movie, and Martin Landau is wonderful in it, but I still think Samuel L. Jackson deserved the award.\n\nAgree?",

I don’t doubt method acting can probably take a toll on your mental health, especially to the lengths he took it with a character as psychotic as the joker (he apparently locked himself in a room for days, some people say weeks, idk), but I can’t help but feel like the media focusing on his method acting turning him insane, which led to his drug overdose and subsequent death, feels like nothing more than a sort of marketing tactic for the movie, to make the joker seem more edgy and dangerous, to then capitalise off his tragic death.",

In Creed, G goes out of his way to grossly obscure the familiar themes. In 2 , he clearly was asked to make them more prominent. You can hear the winning theme from Rocky I at the end of Creed II. But even then, it's not allowed to dominate like it should (perhaps a sound editing decision). \n\nI feel like he failed to either bring a successful fresh take or make effective use of the gift Bill Conti left for him.",

        "text": " I liked the premise of the movie from the moment I saw the trailer. In the movie, it portrays \"humans\" crash landing into earth 65 million years ago, during the reign of dinosaurs, which is a very cool and unexplored concept. \n\n I mean it's not a perfect experience, it's more of a survival movie than an adventure one, but still. You guys might know about hypothesis where humans might not be from this planet or we are aliens. I haven't seen any other movie that explores that concept, the closest I can remember is moonfall, but in it all life is alien, so none of them actually is. \n\n In the movie 65, Mills crash lands on \"an uncharted planet\" and met with \"alien\" creatures, and tries to get off the planet with a little girl Koa. The movie doesn't have much depth in the story, which is it's main negative. Lack of story limited the direction and the overall experience of the film. But the idea is very intriguing. Mills essentially discovered earth 65 million years ago accidentally, and even witnessed the famous asteroid impact. And the technology mills has shows how technologically advanced \"humans\" are, even millions of years ago.\n\n Even the dinosaurs can be thought of as being shown as aliens and monsters because it's in the perspective of mills. To him it is an alien monster, and alien monster it definitely looks. Again, I am not saying it's perfect, but I think it does the job to be watchable. They even put a sci fi bug in Ariana's mouth to creep the hell out of us, to show the alienness and creepiness of this alien monster world, which I think is very good.\n\n I want this film to be at least successful, because I want for big budget films to make use of this premise. It has so much potential.",

I saw it on a shelf later at an independent movie store in my college's town and I bought it for something like $3. If you haven't seen it, it's an absolute treat. It's a John Hughes-style high school movie starring Anton Yelchin, Kat Dennings, and Robert Downey Jr and I think it's incredibly well made.",

Is earth deep faking them to manipulate them? Have the machines somehow infiltrated the communications networks? etc\n\nThey had a really good paranoid atmosphere they don't milk for all its worth, if they did it would remind me of The Thing.
