        "text": "Not to lead anyone astray, I am planning on doing a presentation for my community Atheist group. I need some places to bounce ideas off of. Thank you.\n\nDoes anyone have difficulty with seeing that centuries of religious order has caused the problems of today?  I sometimes can't which is a huge bother for me.  Like it's not hard to see the short-comings of society because it's a set-up (it has to be since human beings created it.) \n\nHowever whenever I see, for example, any mention of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, my little atheist self gets pissed because we basically screwed up a generation of people on all sides to help the rich but it was under the guise of religious retaliation created by nonetheless, religion rearing it's ugly head as the male ego (remember, we had the gulf wars too) \n\n[Established order](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/established%20order) is something that religion had a hand in because it was where people turned for help when kingdoms and governments failed them. It was necessary to keep ceetain people from fighting against eachother back then because we didn't have automation and if something went wrong all hell broke loose fast because they lacked infrastructure/material science knowledge/medicine.  We are seeing this happening with climate change.  Religion is using their past fuck-ups as **attaboys** (see End of days, revelations, prophecies) and we keep throwing that (sinister) S word at them, Science back at them as the answer. Maybe science to them is what homeopathy is to me, crap. But the benefit in presuming this is that it means they think we are literally walking devil people. If they believe a virgin birth, they can literally believe anything.\n\nThey solidify that male ego garbage with their books.  Ever since the printing press and on-demand bible creation was introduced, sciencetists/skeptics and athests have been fighting a gigantic male ego driven book club.  This hopefully is not new info for you folks.\n\n Atheists play defense, alot. Question is, how do we go about establishing a critical mass of Atheist offense and how to maintain that sustainably without burnout or without exposure? What is an Atheist offense?  How can we ID eachother in public. Can we do extraordinary things like command language to untwist the minds of believers back to reality, and question their beliefs?\n\nHere are some more questions:\n\n1) What questions do you have that I can clarify?\n\n2) there are many places I can expand on here so where should I expand on this post?\n\n3) What makes this a good presentation for a group of skeptics and atheists?  What makes it bad (i need sources for one)\n\n4) Is this too conspiracy theory? How should I start my intro?",

        "text": "So I've pretty much always considered myself an atheist as in I don't believe in God or follow any religion, however there are aspects of it I've been struggling with.\n\nFor context, my parents aren't religious. My mother was brought up Catholic, but rejected the whole thing as a teenager. I went to secular schools and was encouraged to discover my own beliefs. I'm currently writing my Master's thesis on the experiences of Irish Magdalene Laundry survivors, so obviously I've been thinking a lot about the topics mentioned in the title.\n\nBoth through writing my thesis and personal experiences, I've found myself incredibly angry at times with God. This doesn't make any sense to me, because I don't believe in God. I hope this doesn't sound crazy. Last year my brother who has autism was diagnosed with cancer and underwent two major surgeries, and I often found myself seething with rage that God could let this happen to such a sweet boy. I also find myself toying with the idea of afterlife a lot. I don't think I believe in Heaven as such, but I do think about people who have died in an abstract 'looking down on me' sense. Has anyone else experienced feelings like this? I've tried to educate myself on religion as much as possible, but I don't really get on with any that I've found so far. \n\nWhat are you guys' thoughts on this? I hope this isn't too rambley! \n",

Joining a religious, social, or support group can give you a place to talk to like-minded people about how to deal with daily stress—and to make new friends.

Religious people get a built in little community. They get a place to go where they feel like they have a purpose in life. Attending rebellious events can give them social time, places to reach out, people to talk too, without having to pay a bunch of money or deal with advertising being shoved in their face 24/7.\n\nMost non-religious meetups I've attended in my life have ended up requiring money, or if not requiring money there was a bunch of advertising everywhere.\n\nSo atheists, I ask you.

        "text": "I'm posting this here because I get very mixed feelings about paying for things for homeless people. It probably relates more to ethics than atheism, but I guess I'm more interested in how you all personally think about this.\n\nOn one hand, I'm happy to help people and make sure they get something to eat, on the other hand, many homeless are homeless because they fell into drug addiction (or so I've been taught). I feel that paying for anything for a homeless person could very well be \"easing up\" their budget for necessities and might be effectively paying for more drugs.\n\nYesterday, I was on my way to an open house when this lady went up to me and asked if I would give her money for some fast food. I said sure, but I would prefer to pay in person. So I did. We we're right near a seminary, and she asked if I was a pastor (I was dressed the part because of the open house).\n\nThis got me thinking about a lot of things. When I was a Christian, I would feel compulsed to offer up some \"come to church and they can help you\", or some \"are you a christian\" or some tip of the hat to Christianity when I interacted with less fortunate people. Now I'm not sure what to say, like I'm not gonna say \"come join atheism™\".\n\nBasically what I'm asking is, when you help with the homeless, why? Is it something you just arbitrarily decide to do? Otherwise, if it's purely just to help them, do you also know organizations to help them long-term that you suggest? Do you leave it at paying for a meal? Do you feel conflicted about them potentially using the money for drug use, even to the degree of not helping them (usually)? Have you ever brought up atheism or reacted to the \"praise God\"s? Maybe you never directly help the homeless, but do so only through charities?",

But I’ve never really engaged much with agnostic or atheistic authors because I began with the presupposition that there is, at the very least, some sort of God. This seems to me to be a pretty big blind spot. So, in an effort to be as critical as possible, I’d love for some of y’all’s favorite book recommendations. I assume I should start with Dawkins’ ‘The God Delusion’ but I am open to any and all suggestions. I have heard that Christopher Hitchens is good as well. They can be “New Atheists”, “anti-theists”, or even just agnostic. I’m not sensitive so lay it on me. I’m not here to argue, debate, or engage in apologetics.

Anyways, this question is for the people who are genuinely open to believing God exists if there is sufficient evidence presented. \n\nScripture, Christian writings, eye witness accounts, personal experiences, etc. can be written off as falsities. Let's say God came down right now and said to you personally, \"I'm God, [your name], and I exist,\" then proceeded to explain your whole life story to prove it. This scenario could still be explained as a hallucination, dream, or even aliens (I guess)! Point is, there's always a way to explain your way out of it or say that's not proof enough. \n\nSo again, what would acceptable evidence be for you? ",

        "text": "Hello all, I am a 23M who is about to marry a pretty goddamn badass woman. However, our wedding will be officiated by a pastor from a non-denominational Church my parents attend, and we just had to fill out a questionnaire to set us up for a pre-wedding counseling session where we discuss ways in which we can look to grow as a couple. As some of the questions point blank asked about our faith, I became stuck between being flat out honest and just playing the part of the good ol’ church kid just to get past this part of the wedding. I am now seeking advice on how to approach this counseling session if anyone has been in a similar scenario.\n\nSome context: my fiancé is the type that says she believes in God, but has never been to church and is monumentally supportive and respectful about my non-belief. She just views me as “me,” and doesn’t see how religious beliefs should change that. My entirely family on the other hand is exactly the opposite. My father’s side (aside from my father, who is less of a fucking idiot) is full of Methodists and baptists who deny evolution and think that gays will burn for eternity. My mother’s side is entirely Catholic. My mother has a history of battling depression, which was almost entirely sparked by a year in which we lost a lot of very close family members within a short amount of time. For her, I believe, me not believing in God would mean that she would never see me again once life was over, which would absolutely kill her. Thus, both of them suspect my non belief, but neither will admit it and try incredibly hard to search for signs that I’m still a child of God. I don’t see any reason as of right now to show them otherwise. Thus, we are having a pastor officiate our wedding from the most non-radical church that we know of. \n\nFor the most part, the counseling questionnaire was pretty secular, which is in line with this church’s mission to be accepting of all people, regardless of their beliefs. Still, several “rate your agreeing” questions popped up on stuff such as “prayer is an important part of my daily routine, my partner and I find strength in God during difficult times, my partner and I agree on our spiritual beliefs,” etc. I remained generally neutral on these questions and lied whenever it was an incredibly pressing question. I figured “fake it till you make it” is the best option here.  Has anybody ever dealt with a similar situation? What’s the best way for an atheist to approach a faith-based premarital counseling session? ",

        "text": "A few weeks ago, I met this LDS guy who's actually very fun to hang out with. I definitely enjoy being with him as a good friend, but I guess he doesn't feel the same way since he wants to be more than friends. So when he asked me out, I firmly said that I only consider him as a friend. He wasn't really having any of it, and stuff leads to one and another, and he finally said something along the lines of, \"What? Do you like girls or something?\" To which I meekly replied, \"...yes.\"\n\nFrom there on, I think he's pretty much flipped out. He thought I was cool and also a genuinely nice person, so finding out that I am a lesbian and an atheist baffled him. He went on a *two-hour* rant about the gospel from the Bible and the Book of Mormon (and I was too polite to cut the conversation), and basically saying that he doesn't want someone like me not being able to go to paradise. \n\nI understand that he means well, but it's just that the fact that I'm also struggling and being in a closet from my devout Presbyterian family, and I definitely struggled with depression. Knowing this full well, he said that my lesbianism \"was just a phase\" and that I'm just \"lost trying to find God's light.\" Discrediting my depression by saying that I'm just confused really made my heart twist. \n\nI mean, I do enjoy hanging out with him since we have a lot in common. It would be really great if we can be great friends, but I'm just not sure if we can be if he keeps trying to proselytize me. And I'm not sure if it's also good for my overall well-being. ",

        "text": "**Context:** I've played in this same softball league with the same church five times over the last eight years. Every week, one or two guys share a Bible study or their personal \"testimony\" for five-ten minutes. I graduate college in December, and this is very likely my final church league season that I could play, regardless of how they may react. I'm not close friends with any of my teammates, though I am friendly with all of them. None of them know about my apostasy.\n\nAm I insane?!\n\nGrowing up in church, I was never exposed to contrary beliefs or viewpoints. Ever. Critical inquiry, friendly debate, alternative viewpoints...all of these things were foreign to me. I grew up in an insular environment, precisely the type cultivated by this church (though I spent my formative years in another). I pretty much lived my life under the operative assumption that *everyone* believed in God; I had no idea what atheism was, or that it was even a live option for anyone. I could never have imagined *not* believing in God. Until it happened to me.\n\n I realized I had become an atheist in February 2015. *Ten months later*, I still experienced enormous guilt in checking out a book by Richard Dawkins from the library (is anyone watching me? what will the librarian think of what I'm checking out?!). Only in the past year or so have I overcome the feelings of shame at my lack of belief.\n\nIn my experience, doubts in the Christian community are taboo. *Rarely*, you'll hear someone express some struggles they're experiencing in their lives, but the Christian paradigm itself is never questioned.\n\nI believe that I can provide a service of sorts to my teammates. Many of them came from similar evangelical backgrounds as me. Many of them are my age. And if they're anything like me, they've never heard a profession of disbelief in person. I think it would have been good for me to hear something like this, while I still believed.\n\nI hope to be quite clear: I'm not trying to create more atheists. Most Christians I've met have never even read the entire Bible, and I'm not convinced most of them could even cogently articulate their belief system (I couldn't have done so when I believed, or at least thought I believed!). Nevertheless, I have no interest in starting an argument with anyone, nor in presenting any specific challenges against Christianity. I hope to avoid making any overly risible statements or opinions; though I now consider the message of the Bible, taken at face value, to be deeply immoral, I see no benefit to espousing moral judgments on their holy book that could be misconstrued or taken as personal attacks. At most, I've considered ending with a plea for them to reconsider the doctrine of hell, which the church espouses its adherence to.\n\nMy overarching aim is to humanize atheists, to help my teammates realize the tremendous struggle that losing your faith is, and the pervasive sense of loss accompanying said journey. I never wanted to be an atheist, but it happened. I left the Christian faith kicking and screaming. I fervently hope that I can convey this sentiment to them.\n\nI have nothing at all against Christians. Many of my closest friends remain Christians, and they are without exception genuinely awesome people: kind, compassionate, intelligent, and successful. Are they wrong about Christianity? Yes, I'd say so. So what? We're all wrong about some things, and we should always consider that we could be wrong, even about the beliefs most integral to our lives. Myself very much included! The real question to ask is this: Is being wrong a capital offense? Of course not! Yet in Christianity, sadly, it is.\n\nI'd like to open my talk with this quote:\n\n&gt;The biggest failures and disappointments in my life have led me to look beyond what money or power or friends can buy. When you’re face down at the very bottom of who you are, and there is no formality or pretence to cling to, all your masks fall off. In this broken place, our lives can be seen for what they are, no more no less; we are ourselves.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The question is this: What happens after the twin towers in our lives fall? Do we become bitter and hateful or does redemption come into focus? I’ve been on both sides…only one is beautiful.\n\nAnd end with this quote:\n\n&gt;I’ve often thought of The Maker as an incredible songwriter- making something beautiful out of the pain. And I believe that he’s still in business: re-making, re-deeming, re-leasing, re-newing. There is no church building that could possibly contain a God like that. Nothing is out of bounds. Which means none of my thoughts, questions, fears, or failures are out of bounds. The curtain has been torn forever. I am the temple of the Living God. Me. This dark mess of pride, lust, and apathy- I am the arms and feet of Christ? Truly astounding.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And yet, I don’t always act this way. When it comes to religion I tend to play with the kid gloves. Not just with my songs either- in my thought life I tend to act as if God couldn’t take a punch. What kind of a God do I believe in? If he’s not big enough for my doubts and fears and shortcomings then he’s not God after all. Robert Frost said, “The best way around is always through.” And he’s right. “Don’t run away,” I tell myself, “Face the dark places.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A while back I had the privilege of meeting one of my musical heroes. He gave me some songwriting advice that I will never forget. “God doesn’t need a lawyer,” he said, “Your job is to be honest.” I need these reminders more than anyone. That which is hidden is empowered. So bring it to light. Face your shortcomings. Sing about your deepest fears. Don’t pull punches. Swing as hard as you can. You’re not alone.\n\n(I'm only being halfway facetious when I tell my friends about the book I'm writing: *The Beautiful Letdown*: How Jon Foreman made me an atheist, and why I love him for it)\n\nIn between, I intend to briefly touch on:\n\n1) Coming as close as humanly possible to failing out of college (significantly aided and abetted by my depression over gradually losing confidence in Christianity; in multiple-effects modeling, I'd identify these two factors as two-way effects, inseparable), after spending the entirety of my childhood predicating my sense of self-worth on my perceived intelligence \\[the other twin tower alluded to in the above quote\\].\n\n2) Losing out on the opportunity to date a truly wonderful young woman precisely because of my apostasy.\n\n3) My efforts in maintaining a hemorrhaging faith, and why they ultimately failed.\n\nI'd be really putting myself out there if I do this, and I intend to include the embarrassing personal details precisely because I want them to realize the very real personal and emotional cost that apostasy often exacts. And just to be honest, because I greatly value honesty. I'm not particularly eloquent, nor am I a particularly effusive personality. I'm not overly concerned about my teammates' potential negative reactions; what can they honestly do, ban me from playing future seasons and tell my family what they already know? But I do want to respectfully and kindly communicate my experiences in losing my faith, in a manner that could at least provide them food for further thought and rumination.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Am I overly optimistic? Should I go through with this? If so, what should I keep in mind when addressing my teammates? Any points I should address that I haven't mentioned?\n\nThanks to anyone who read this far. This community has been a blessing for me over the last couple years.",

First of all, no matter who you are you will have at least one disagreement morally with any other person. This is because morality is based on our own personal views and psychological idiosyncrasies. Even with a god being real morality is subjective because not everyone would agree with that god's view of morality. Just because someone is super powerful, doesn't mean that what they think is right to do is right for everyone. To say you have morality that is objective is pretty much just saying you think your morality is correct. Well no duh, everyone thinks their morality is correct. Societies can agree on certain morals and make laws, and just because morality is subjective doesn't mean people can't enforce the morality that is widely agreed to be true. My main point is that with or without a god morality is still subjective to the individual person. What do you guys think of this?",

Anyone who takes the time to really familiarize themselves with the topic, I am sure have stumbled across a similar state of confusion.  \n\n\nTo put it simply, I decided to dip my toe in the field of philosophy that concerns this, and it has been quite complicating for me to think about.   \n\n\nAs an atheist, this topic comes up a lot and there is a pretty even divide in the community about whether or not morals are based in subjectivity, or morals have an actual objective foundation. I am very much concerned with exhibiting a healthy amount of skepticism in all ideas, and I try very much to do that here since I ultimately care about the reasons for each position. However, the arguments for objective moral actions is quite dubious to me, and I haven't come across an argument for objectivity that truly addresses what morality is, or answers particular issues relating to.   \n\n\nAs I investigate, I familiarize myself with many arguments for both, and I cannot see there being any genuine soundness to the position of morals being founded in objectivity. Firstly, I think there are some problems with coming to a solid definition of many phrases that are commonly tossed back and forth, such as good and bad, and that is also precisely why I am finding it hard to believe that there is any objective sense of the terms.   \n\n\nI am willing to elaborate more on my position about morals if interested,  but overall this post is meant to reach out to others to hopefully get some good feedback on the whole issue, or if I am missing some kind of point somewhere. I am very eager to hear differing positions on the matter, Thanks!",

After learning about the adoption of Christianity by Rome in the 4th century most of this assumption was squashed. People today don't convert because they see miracles, they convert because that is what they are told.  One thing that has me wondering is: who were the people that initially spread these miracles?  Surely the most early converts had to have been swayed by some sort of evidence, where did this come from?  I don't really see a motive for just making it up for no reason and being persecuted for it. So my question stands, Why did so many people believe in Jesus's miracles when they did not happen and where are their origins?",

        "text": "For a long time I felt like an outsider. Growing up atheist may have had a lot to do with it, since I spent my formative years in a predominately Christian town. When the other kids talked about 'going to church', 'sunday school' or 'lent', I felt left out.\n\nFurthermore, my parents were non-religious, therefore religious holidays, traditions and rites were not imparted on me. We celebrated 'American holidays' in a secular way - gifts for Christmas, egg hunt for Easter, turkey for Thanksgiving and candy for Halloween. But as I grew older, I couldn't find any real meaning in these holidays. Without having a good reason to celebrate these holidays, for the most part, I stopped.\n\nEventually I had kids of my own, and had to reassess how I felt about holidays. While I didn't see the underlying significance of holidays, I couldn't ignore their importance. It seemed to me that by following the same ritual celebration year after year, people gain a sense of predictability, security and comfort. It reinforces the meaning behind the holiday, and it helps to paint a picture that society is greater than the individual.\n\nI had also been struggling with depression and isolation, and many times found myself wishing for something 'greater than myself' to lean on. The first few Christmases with children were interesting, because I rejected the religious element of the holiday, but still found myself comforted by the familiar decorations, songs, etc.\n\nAfter much thought, I determined that secular holidays were what I was looking for. Something I could find meaning in, create a ritual for, and follow every year in order to feel excited, comforted, grounded. This year for Valentine's day, my kids and I sat around the dining room table and made each other valentines. Even though I used to call it a 'Hallmark Holiday' I've decided to rebrand it into something simpler - a holiday about expressing love.\n\nI'm slowly thinking of creating a list of secular holidays that I wish to celebrate. Each holiday would need some significance, and precise rituals that I would follow each year. I've only just started, but I'm feeling optimistic.\n\nMy question to you all: how do you celebrate secular holidays or traditions? Do you follow any unusual ones or have you created your own?",

        "text": "This is a term I like to use when people, usually Christian apologists, make an argument about accepting gay people while still considering homosexual sex as a sin that should be avoided. You usually hear this in the form of “hate the sin, not the sinner.” \n\nFor example, here is the official stance on homosexuality of the Catholic Church:\n\n&gt;2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that ‘homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.’ They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.\n2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. They do not choose their homosexual condition; for most of them it is a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God’s will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord’s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.\n2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.\n\nFrom section 2358, the church admits that homosexuality is not a choice and that they should not be discriminated against. Sounds great, doesn’t it?\n\nYet from section 2357, it still described homosexual acts as a “grave depravity”, that “under no circumstances can they be approved.”\n\nIn section 2359, the solution for this so called “depravity” is chastity. They just shouldn’t have sex so they can reach this so called “Christian perfection”.\n\nSo what can we conclude? We shouldn’t hate gay people, but we should make sure they don’t have sex or live out a happy and successful love life because gay sex is still a sin. Does that sound very progressive to you?\n\nI know this is certainly much better than the Church’s previous stance on homosexuality, but they still have a long way to go.",

        "text": "It seems that most of this sub talks about the cruelty of religious extremism. While reform religions such as Reform Judaism or some modernized churches or certainly in no comparison to the Catholic Church or to religious terrorists, I want to talk about the problems with the idea of a reformed religion itself (aside from the fact that they are factually incorrect).\n\nI see the concept of a reformed religion as based on a self contradiction. Modern people’s morals have certainly changed from the morals of the Bible, yet at the same time they need the Bible to justify their morals. For example, many modern Christians believe there is nothing wrong with gay marriage, despite God’s opposition. So what do they do? They make convoluted interpretations  to ty to fit in gay marriage as acceptable in God’s eyes.\n\nAnother issue is that it really doesn’t matter how peaceful the religious doctrine is. Religion is more than an ideology or philosophy, it is an identity. When people identify as different groups, whether it be cultural, national, or religious, there is always an inevitable conflict. Why are Buddhists killing Muslims in Myanmar? Doesn’t Buddhism teach to respect other religions? \n\nIt doesn’t matter. They were told they were different because they were Buddhist and the others were Muslim. This “otherness” leads to an inevitable conflict.\n\nAny other thoughts?",

E.g Animism coming out of Africa with the first human migrations then progressing into Polytheism in Europe and India, while Shinto grew out of Animism in Eastern Asia. Then Monotheism rising in the Middle East and becoming what it is today. Every new religion growing out of the previous one and cannibalizing the ones around it.\n\nBut the idea of the soul seems to start before recorded history and from what I can tell most religions start at that simple point. It's the one thing every religion has in common, there is a part of you that will live on.\n\nMakes sense in a way. The fear of death coupled with an evolving mind which tried to make connections using whatever information it had was bound to make a few faulty assumptions to ease the fear. But what amazes me is how long this idea has persisted and how prevalent it is.\n\nSo does anyone know of any extra reading I could find on this? Thanks.",

I decided to pursue a scientific career because the idea of trying to understand our universe sounded like a very noble goal, and the idea that the fundamental truth to the universe would have a certain beauty and elegance to it. This labmate of mine is Catholic and enjoys debating, and his arguments as to why he's Catholic basically boil down to:\n\n1. An argument that is basically stolen from me and rebranded. I insisted that God is just one random argument among an infinite number of random guesses, making any random guess at the truth worthless compared against a hypothesis with evidence backing it. He takes this and says any evidence in favor of Catholicism backs it, such as the cloak Our Lady of Guadalupe (which is clearly a hoax but y'know, I can't convince him because they don't allow scientists to actually analyze that cloak) and personal accounts of religious experiences.\n2. Subjectivity in values. He says he values practicality over finding truth, and that believing is practical to him. Some gem quotes are \"What's wrong with being wrong?\" and \"What if I don't care about the truth?\"\n\nI think I know the best answer is to just not bother debating with him at this point, but honestly it just frustrates me. I get that his research is more utility over discovery, but it just bothers me to know there are people in STEM fields with this type of philosophy. There's something just very crude about it.",

        "text": "I'm pretty convinced there is nothing super natural. I'm borderline closed-minded about it. I understand that a lot of religion, and spiritual talk, is metaphor. I am also not evangelical in my views. I don't bring it up, ever. But, I find invariably that almost everyone I meet holds some bullshit view. Everything happens for a reason, there has to be something, or they're into some kind of alternative medicine. Even people will a decent level of scientific understanding. The latest person even ascribes to \"geomancy\" which she added is considered a pseudoscience. Catch is she though that meant the same as \"semi-science\". \n\nI want to get along with these people. Everyone potentially has something to offer and life is complex and there are a lot more things to learn about than scientific knowledge. You can learn a lot about courage from a Jehovah's Witness who goes around knocking on doors etc. but I find that people invariably bring up some \"factual\" claim about the world in a way that they want me to validate this belief. At this point I can't keep quiet and start the incredibly tedious process of pointing out the fallacy, then explaining that I, in fact, do not believe in anything, yes, not even in ghosts or destiny, and then I have to weed through the barrage of anecdotal evidence and then I have to watch all their youtube clips or read their books etc (which I am not going to do) and then the fledgeling relationship devolves into them trying to convince me of their particular pseudoscience.\n\nHow do you guys get along with these people? Do you just lie and casually validate their views with a knowing nod, or do you have some better strategies for dealing with it. As a rule I don't enjoy convincing people of my opinion. I just find it hard to pretend its one thing when its not. \n\nIt's 1AM here so I am going to turn in, but I am genuinely wondering. Hope you have some insights. \n\nUpdate: \nThanks for all the input. I am very appreciative of how level headed people are here. I love this sub. I have picked up a few things from your comments that I am going to try: \n\n* try to change the topic into something unrelated\n* talk about the personal attribute behind their view - if its medical I can talk about how that shows they are a caring person\n* point out that people seldom change their views and that we have different views and so discussing these things will be pointless\n* consider simply moving on to other people if none of these approaches work. \n\nUpdate 2:\nI used this response to a specific person now - trying to use some of what I have learnt here: \n\n&gt; You know, we have different views about how to decide if something is true or not. That's fine. I just don't want to talk about those things. You come from a place of wanting to help and I appreciate that. That's a good quality. I don't think your advice is valid but I think your intention is good. \n&gt;\n&gt; I'd much rather talk about the weather or sports or some other things we agree on than debate where we differ in our approaches. People seldom change their minds about these things so I don't think it's worth wasting our time discussing these areas. Let's just move on when we discover a point like this. \n\n",

        "text": "OK, so I know categories and labels are fluid and socially driven, but I've always held off on warming up to the idea of calling myself \"Atheist\", for a few reasons \\- mainly because it always struck me like it's a belief system that simply exists to negate other belief systems. I'm sure that can inspire enough corrections, not making a statement.\n\nI'm curious, if this briefly sounds Atheist:\n\n1. I don't buy into an intervening higher power.\n2. I believe in a connection between all things. Not some aura or spirit, just a bond of some meaning. I don't go too much deeper than that, only that it compels me to act with compassionate reciprocity. I try to be kind to all life, because we're \"connected\". Somehow.\n\nThat's it. Won't bore with you much else. Just that it feels like #1 is clearly Atheism, but #2 is leading in a spiritual\\-ish realm that I'm pretty sure Atheists generally shun or rule out. I will not adopt some hyphenated categorization \\- I'm fine with continuing with saying I'm \"Agnostic\". Just curious how this strikes others \\- is this Atheism? \\(However you define it\\)\n\n  \n\\[UPDATE\\]\n\nThe answer is Yes.\n\n1. \"God\" is just man project man on the universe.\n2. We *are* connected, in an ecosystem, we share matter, we're all recycled star dust, etc. \n\nThanks for the help. Also, most of you are really helpful and pretty open about all this.  \n",

        "text": "So I feel like I'm going to sound like a simpleton, but this came up in a conversation. Thinking about this on an intuitive level, the question above sounds really fucking stupid. \"Of course, not\" I would say. However, I understand that intuitive thinking is not always right, so if someone could explain the logic to me, that would be great.\n\n\nSo this all started because someone told me that I'm pretty open with my atheism and they wish they could do the same with their own beliefs. I told them that I wasn't that open, and that if they believe the church without a doubt, it shouldn't bother them to be open with their beliefs. For example, I am a supporter of vaccines. I don't care if an anti vax person is offended by my beliefs. I know they are wrong and I am right. This doesn't mean I'm an asshole, it just means I am confident enough to state my beliefs in a conversation occasionally. \n\nSo I asked him why would it bother him if people who, based on his beliefs, were morally in the wrong judge him for being right. That when the whole \"My beliefs could be true, but not correct\" came up. The next thing I said (and what I ended up going back to) is if that is really the case, how can an institution claim to be a 100% accurate moral authority? I told him initially that things are either true or false. He then tells me that he doesn't believe in a true/false dichotomy. He then gave me an example of how something can be true, but not correct. \n\nP1 Criminals should not be rewarded\nP2 Criminals mean that a person is breaking the law\nP3 Illegal immigrants are breaking the law\nP4 Letting them stay is a reward\nC Therefore, all illegal immigrants should be deported\n\nSo when I brought up the nuances of immigration, both legal and illegal, he said it didn't matter because I  wasn't addressing the central points. Then, when i did start to attack various premises, it no longer mattered because I was only attacking the example, not the argument of  true=!correct. That was the most annoying part because it just seemed like a way to set up the argument that he could never lose. This led up to another point of whether or not he considered examples like this as evidence to the argument. If yes, then I should be able to engage with them and therefore the argument itself. If no, then he has no evidence to the claim true=!correct and he should provide evidence without examples. \n\nAfter saying that the examples were the first step to understanding and flip flopping on whether or not the example about was evidence, he finally said no and gave the real evidence for true=!correct. It was logic=! reality, or rather logic is not a perfect representation of reality. He then asked if i thought logic=reality. I ended up saying how I feel logic one of the many tools to prove what's real and what's not. He then said because of this the there is a discrepancy between the two, therefore true=!correct. I feel like there would be other ways to prove some to be true other than logic, but then it was pointed out that \"truth\" is a logical term, so you can't use something like empiricism to figure out if something is true (he didn't say the last part, but it was implied).And we are back full circle to my first comment.\n\nNow I have a question about logic: can one accept premises but reject a conclusion? The guy I was talking to made a mention of how true=!correct because in the example he gave, people would agree with the premises but not necessarily to the conclusion. To me that doesn't prove his claim. I made up an argument where one could agree with the premises but not the conclusion:\n\nP1 All cats are mammals\nP2 All humans are mammals\nC Therefore all humans are cats\n\nHis response was that this argument wasn't sound, but for more complicated conclusion where the truth value is unknown, it doesn't work like that. Finally, what would you guys say to all of this?",

        "text": "First, i apologize if this seems like a long rant or posted on where it doesn't belong.\n\nSo i had another argument with my religious dad (i know it's stupid). It started out of nowhere, we were talking about music and when he's about to leave he suddenly mention about my atheism, or in his way of saying \"my rejection of god\".\n\nThe \"argument\"(if you could call it that) boils down to where sperms and egg cells come from, the universe's current state and position and changes in dna, there might be some about famous people's \"religious quote\" like einstein.\n\nHe started by claiming that i'm an atheist today because i'm \"disappointed in god\" (which is kinda true in a way but that's a story for another day, i'm personally more disappointed in him), he then asserts that i wouldn't exist today if it wasn't for god, i asked him what he means and he says that i exist as an entity today because of god's help, he's the reason i exist. I told him that i exist today because of (regretfully) his sperm reaching into my mother's egg cell, he said yes but god decides whether the child being conceived is going to be me or not and i can't choose who's my parents or whether i'm to be born at all, i had no free will in my conception. I told him it's decided by which one is the fastest sperm and what kind of information it carries in it's dna, he said that we don't know whether it's going to be me or not, or even on how sperm meets the egg cell is still a mystery for scientists.(can anyone confirm this? A link or explanation would be helpful as i would be asking for confirmations quite a lot). \n\nHe said if the sperm meets the egg cell, what's stopping the others from entering the egg cell also how many egg cells are there in a woman's womb. Based on what i know, i told him that the egg cell closes when a sperm enters preventing other sperms from entering(can anyone confirm?), and i don't know how many egg cells are there. He said he can't imagine that to be true and that \"there are no proof\" to that, i told him to search the internet for the answers he's looking for but brushes off by saying that the internet could be wrong. I told him while the internet could be wrong it could also be true, he just replied with while he could search for it he wouldn't know which one is true and which one isn't and that as far as he knows there are no proofs whatsoever.\n\nIn a fit of emotions i told him that he deliberately keeps himself stupid by not searching for the truth to keep the assertion that he's right, he just deflected by saying that what he says(as he know it) is true, that there are no proof and the internet could be wrong basically repeating the previous points.\n\nHe then said if humans came from sperm then where does sperm come from?(this is basically the chicken egg analogy only with human sperm) He says that if human came from sperm and sperm came from human and so on, which came first? And he asserts that there has to be progenitor humans(2 to be exact) and an all powerful being must have created them, there has to be a beginning.\n\nI didn't know much about this but i suggested that humans may not have always used sperm and egg cell to reproduce( can anyone confirm or clarify?). A long time ago we might be very different from what we are today and live and reproduce differently as far as millions of years ago where we might just be amoebas and self replicate.\n\nHe laughs and said that this \"millions of years of evolution from a simple single cell organism is unimaginable\" and there are simply no proof to that, he even said that he heard scientists has claimed that evolution has been \"disproven\"(can anyone confirm?).\n\nI said again he could look this up on the internet but that goes as well as you can imagine.So i told him if he wants people to accept his assertions as true he would need to prove them i.e. the existence of god and his part into creating everything in the universe including and especially humans.\n\nHe then said that humans are different than monkeys and have always been like this because our dna is different from monkeys and our dna \"never change\". I told him that we do change and that humans from tens of thousands years ago are very different than humans today, he deflected by saying that it's just because of genetics and our dna is still largely the same, can anyone confirm this? I don't know much about it so i'm unable to refute him.\n\nSo i returned to my point that he would need to prove his assertions to be true, so the conversation diverted to him saying while yes that it's hard to prove god, how does the universe or the solar system came to be exactly how it is now? How did the sun position itself so perfectly to the earth that it could sustain life? Flowers have the ability to photosynthesize and the sun just so happen to be above us. He asserts that \"it can't be a coincidence\".\n\nI said that it could just be a coincidence and that nobody commanded for that to happen, he just said that it's too precise and too complicated to be a coincidence and the entire conversation just turned into 2 kids screaming \"IT'S TRUE\" and \"NO IT'S NOT\" for a few minutes.\n\nFinally he stops and said that there are people, famous and intelligent people who acknowledge how important religion is like einstein(correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't einstein agnostic?). He quoted one of einstein's quote, i don't remember exactly what it is but it's basically that \"religion without science is blind,science without religion is paralyzed\"(paraphrased and translated from my language). I said that just because someone famous said it doesn't mean it's true, there are famous intellectuals of the past who has said something demeaning about women like that they would never be as smart as men. He deflected with saying that einstein isn't just a famous person, he's an intellectual that the entire world looked up to for science, without him we wouldn't be living the way we do now. I basically just go back to my previous point which already addressed his point about einstein, that he could be wrong.\n\nThen everything turned into another yelling war so i got pissed and told him he's just not willing to listen to reason and told him to leave and left my bedroom.\n\nthat was my last encounter with him, it was so stressful i thought i might have another anxiety attack.\n\nand to those who said i can just not to talk to him, i already addressed this in r/atheism he's basically unavoidable. I already tried to not turn the conversation into a theological debate but it went as smoothly as i wrote above.\n\nI'm just curious on how other people would approach this and how to deal with him in an intelligent manner.\n\nThank you in advance.",
