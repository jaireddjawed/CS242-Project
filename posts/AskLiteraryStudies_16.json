How did he manage it? Did he check out text book after text book from a library? Did he have a mentor? Or did he simply open up a book, say Madam Bovary, and after a while understand what Flaubert was doing with little prior knowledge of the mechanics of fiction writing? And how did people prior to him, with even less available to them, learn it themselves?\n\nWhen I think about all the pestering people, or internet searches I've done trying to understand literature, I feel quite unworthy knowing people with much less available to them managed to know so much about literature. I'm currently looking at an 800 page book on craft, and a 300 page dictionary of literary terms, feeling quite pathetic. ",

Any close analysis seems to come from the second camp, and it all seems to be a straightforward reinforcement of Steinbeck's message (no shit that the turtle represents the migrants).\n\nAre there any less partisan works on Grapes out there? I'm struggling to get much out of the book other than _the_ message, which I suppose is something that gets levelled at Steinbeck a lot. Do you all have any thoughts on it beyond the validity of its aim? If there really isn't anything there (more likely answer: I haven't looked hard enough), what does that say to you about Steinbeck and the book, other than the \"it's shallow and he's a one-note author\" stuff people have written a million articles on?",

Why couldn't they go like this: man vs. self, man vs. other, man vs. nature?

Sorry if this is the wrong place, but I've seen lots of posts recently asking for suggestions of texts that show obscure themes and I thought I would ask for help with a course I'm designing. \n\nThe basic theme is conformity and fitting in to a small community or wider society. The two main texts I'm using are *The Crucible* by **Arthur Miller** and *Rhinocéros* by **Eugène Ionesco**. I'd like to look at what people do to fit in with those around them, the choices they make, and the prices they pay to join or remain apart.\n\nWhat I would like to  do is to find examples of shorter texts, short stories or the like, and extracts from longer texts for smaller discussions on the theme. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions that can be linked to these two themes or the texts? \n\nI'd like to use a mixture of sources, so I'm looking at plays, short stories, extracts from novels, poems, essays, and articles, but I'd also want to use some weirder examples and more esoteric texts. I'm going to use an episode of the *Twilight Zone*, Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer, there's a couple children's books I'm looking at, extracts from *1984* and *Darkness at Noon* and possibly something from *Heart of Darkness*. I might use some stuff from the Wasteland and the speech from the Monster in *Frankenstein*.\n\nSo I've got these basic ideas, but I'm wondering if anyone can recommend from weirder more unknown or unexpected texts that I can use with these. I'm trying to have fun with this, so it's interesting and exciting and weird. \n\nThanks a lot. You guys rule. ",

I am interested in 20th cent. and contemporary American lit, with focuses in feminist studies and gender representation, and in human rights representations and development through literature. Is this still too broad an area, or worse yet, too out-of-touch with current American lit research to propose for a PhD lit program?

I am currently looking at Oxford, Vanderbilt, Columbia, UNC at Chapel Hill, Duke, U of Maryland at College Park, U of Texas at Austin, UPenn, U Chicago, and Emory.\n\nFinally, would you recommend taking the GRE English Subject Exam? I know UC Berkeley, Stanford, Yale, Princeton, Boston U, Harvard, U Virginia, Cornell, Rutgers, and Johns Hopkins require it and U Texas at Austin highly recommends.

        "text": "All my life I've been surrounded by people who love reading fiction books -- friends, teachers, family, coworkers. They will begin to tell me about a book, or give me a recommendation of a book, which typically leads to my confession: I've never read a fiction book that I enjoyed. \n\nIt's really depressing and frustrating. I've read plenty of books for school. I've read a few of my own choosing. A few that others have recommended. I've even tried to read the books of some of my favorite movies, like Fight Club. \n\nFrom what I seem to gather, there are typically two \"reasons\" given for reading books. One, for entertainment, and two, for the themes/interpretations. \n\nFor the first reason, it is something I am obviously lacking. There is nothing I find enjoyable about reading a story. I would much rather see or hear it. This is not really a \"reading\" problem, because I actually love reading nonfiction books. There's so much to learn out there. Reading a story that never actually happened seems just like such a waste of time -- I might as well read the sparknotes. \n\nSpeaking of sparknotes, that brings me to reason 2, the interpretations of the story. I see absolutely no reason why someone would read the whole book if they wanted to understand the themes (unless of course there are no summaries, cliff notes, or other analysis already available). In all my years of education I have been asked to read many books, and have usually exclusively read some type of summary, or just talked about the book with someone who had read it. This always got me an A on my papers/essays and even allowed me to participate in class discussion. \n\nBelieve it or not...I actually do find value in reason 2, even if I only read the sparknotes. I like hearing about unique ideas regarding the human condition being told in a story (that's why I like movies too). But, I simply cannot wrap my head around why anyone wants to read the entire text to get these themes. \n\nAmong the many reasons I find fiction books boring is the pointlessly long descriptions of things which have no impact on the story/message. \n\nOne of the few types of fictional stories I sometimes found enjoyable were fables/fairytales. These stories are typically very lacking in description aside from the key points to the story. You get the moral of the story in about 5 pages, rather than 300. \n\nAnyway, that's about it. Sorry if this post is pointless. I'm just very frustrated and sick of getting weird looks when I tell people I just can't connect to fiction books. Trying to find some way to understand more about myself and also society.",

        "text": "I applied last season to grad school in English Lit departments, and after being turned down and questioning my life's purpose, I have reached the conclusion I was applying to the wrong departments. I plan to re-apply this fall. After the previous application season some of my professors who wrote referrals for me recommended that I look into Comparative Literature programs, suggesting that would be more congruent with what I like and want to do. I'm highly interested in the theory/philosophy of literature and in applying that to texts. I know that I want to do research on the operation of language and silence in literature by Beckett, Carroll, Kafka, Camus, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, DeLeuze etc. More specifically, I want to contribute research on the concept that language operates on different wavelengths, and that perhaps the only common wavelength is that of silence. I am pretty sure Comp Lit is the right path for me, but if you think otherwise, let me know :)\n\nHowever, my biggest question and the thing that has me weary of comp lit pertains to the language requirements. I took two years of Spanish as an undergraduate and I feel like I have a decent grasp on the language, though (I'm probably too harsh on myself) I don't believe I have a good enough handle to do deep analytical work on advanced Spanish texts. I also do not know a whole lot about Spanish literature and I don't know who I would read that would fit in the same genre as the authors I listed above. I am totally open to learning German, French, Dutch, Russian, etc. (seriously though, I'd love to learn every language) but I'm concerned that my lack of language skills could bar me from the comp lit programs I want to apply to. So my questions are: How stringent are the language requirements? Are the tests fairly easy to pass? Are schools good about learning the language while you are attending and are they willing to work with you? Or is language acquisition support variable based on the department? I feel like this shouldn't hold me back, but it is, and I want to know if it is a valid concern. ",

What did he actually believe about religion? \n\nIs there supposed to be a message about the types of powerful people that a certain strong family can make? Fyodor goes one path and is an ambivalent alcoholic but his aloofness makes him a strong charachter. Alexy attracts people purely with charm and well ordered and handled intentions which govern his life. Dmitry is so passionate and bold, that he is a person people are forced to contend with. Ivan is impressive intellectually. Four different caricatures of different personalities. Four different roots people can go, yet all still important, powerful (in some ways), and honourable. The book seems obviously to be a study of personality, and to a lesser extent a philosophical thought provoker. The question is are all four characters part of a larger subset of a certain type of character, such as an exceptional kind? This is sort of like a theme in Crime and Punishment about how the protagonist thinks he is somehow Napolean like. \n\nWhat does Ivan's personality have in relationship to his philosophy, and what does it aay about his famous dictum, 'without religion, everything is permitted'? He is not an especially bold or effective personality, and is certainly still attached to Alexy. When one imagines the holder of said dictum one conjures a picture of a person like Dimitry. If Ivan truly held that belief he would have a personality that is so self-serving he would be more effective. Does this seek to show that there is a dichotomy between thought and personality?",

Is that hard for you to do, spirit of evil?'\n' Nothing is hard for me to do,' answered Woland, 'You know that very well.'

I have read this book twice and i still struggle to understand the meaning of these words. I feel that this sentence is one of great importance within the work as a whole. On what criteria is the master judged not to deserve light and what deeper meaning could one draw from this portion of the text? The character of the master seems to me to be in many ways a portrait of Bulgakov himself. Is this just a projection of some personal feeling of Bulgakov?

Circe turns his men into pigs, but only because his men behaved badly towards her and her hospitality. Th only host that acts out of purely selfish desire is Calypso, as she keeps Odysseus captive against his will. \n\nSo could it be fair to say that, while commenting on hoe hosts should behave, the story is also critical of a guests behaviour too?",

It was something to do with a window, and a reflection, and a ghost. Then I remembered: Lockwood had a similar experience in *Wuthering Heights*, when he dreamed that Catherine's ghost was trying to come in through his bedroom window at Thrushcross Grange.\n\n\nI was an English Lit major, but it's been a few years since I was in college and I haven't done much reading/literary analysis since then. So I'll appeal to you fine folks: what's with the similarities? Why were Charlotte and Emily so interested in mirrors and windows and reflections and ghosts trying to get into people's bedrooms?

The professors decided to include interviews to these playwrights in the investigation. Each member of the team (mostly professors but some students too) picked a writer to research and interview.\n\nI picked Susana Tampieri, a little known (but not total unknown) female playwright that lives in Mendoza. She started writing plays in her youth in the 50s. She was also an Atheist and Feminist activist. She won a number of prizes and there is a couple of newspapers and magazines interviews of her and a number of media articles on her (I've compiled and digitized everything I could find, around 15 items total). But there's not much (or none at all) in-depth info on her, her poetics, her influences, her reflection on her own work and career, etc.\n\nI'd really like to make the most out of this interview because she's lucid and well for now, but who knows for how long.\n\nWe had an informal class by a History grad in which she explained us about the methodology of Oral History. It was mostly on *how* to conduct interviews and while it was very useful, the matter of *what* to ask fell on each of us. And I feel like I might be forgetting some interesting areas or topics of which to ask.\n\nSo if anyone wants to suggest something, wether is something you think I *can't leave out* or something interesting to ask, I am all ears.

In the introduction Selden writes about 'Old', 'New', and 'Modern' theories and approaches to literature. The part I struggle with is that the author differentiates between something he calls scholarship and another thing he calls criticism but doesn't offer a definition. For example:\n\n\n&gt; (...) New Criticism tried to establish a thoroughly professional discipline of literary study which saw scholarship as the hand-maiden of criticism and not the other way around. Even now the imaginary divide between 'critics' and 'scholars' can arouse mutual suspicion and hostility. The scholar accuses the new-fangled critic of lacking real discipline of study, while the critic sneers at the 'dry-as-dust' and 'unimaginative' work of the scholar.\n\n\nI suspect 'critic' means the contemporary commentator on literature. However, so far in my course (3rd year of a BA in English Studies) 'literary criticism' and 'literary scholarship' have been used interchangeably. What is the difference between the two? Is this issue still relevant today? Is it a major gap in my general knowledge if this issue is not clear to me? ",

I will greatly appreciate any help.\n\nThe first story is called \"I’ll Be Waiting for You When the Swimming Pool is Empty\" (1971). I could not find the text available online but the plot goes approximately as follows: A nice young Terran boy on his gap year stumbles on a very primitive planet and sets about, in his charmingly naive and bumbling way, to improve it, like a Peace Corp volunteer teaching basketball to a tribe of headhunters. He advances the development of their society greatly, and they start interplanet travel to bring enlightenment to more planets. At last they bring all the planets to their own, now advanced, level. They send a message to the Terran boy asking him what to do next but he never gets it (presumably being already dead of old age). I more or less got all the allusions in it (hopefully) except the following:\n\n* the actual title. Is it a reference to some song or poem? \n* the author makes fun of popular brands, e.g. his sound system brand is \"Marsony\" = Mars + SONY, the spaceship is \"Galhonda\" = galaxy + Honda; his forcefield is \"GE-Bilblas\", the GE part is clear but what is Bilblas?\n* \"And in a very short while they had a kibbutz, and the girls were teaching **Walden set theory** and creative hygiene.\" Set theory is a branch of mathematics, and Walden is a book by Thoreau, but it does not make a lot of sense taken together...\n\nThe second story is titled \"Painwise\", and can be read online here: https://lexal.net/scifi/scifiction/classics/classics_archive/tiptree4/. In short, it is a story of an astronaut scouting alien worlds whose pain receptors are rewired somehow so he’s impervious to torture, yet he can still suffer in his isolation and loneliness. He is picked up by a live space capsule ~~manned~~ ~~aliened~~ staffed by three sentient empath aliens. He fetches food from various planets for them - they do not dare to land on these planets because it's very painful for them every time, them being empaths and there being so much pain in the Universe. Now my question is about the following: \n\n* \"Sometime later while he was feeding Muscle with **proffit ears**...\" What could these proffit ears be? It's possible that the author just invented a name for some exotic food from distant planet, but I will be grateful for any other ideas.\n* (describing the character's adventures) \"He was driving a stagecoach, **wiped in salt combers**, tossed through volcanoes with peppermint flames, crackling, flying, crumbling, burrowing, freezing, exploding...\" - the part in bold is not clear.\n* (about sex) \"I had five women and **a cloud-painting team**...\" - the part in bold is not clear. Could it mean a group of artists or does it have some other meaning?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Eliot's *The Waste Land*,  Ezra Pound's *Hugh Selwyn Mauberley*, Luigi Pirandello's *Henry IV*, Bertolt Brecht's *Life of Galileo*\n\nThe course also has two background readings: ‘Lyric Poetry and Society' by Adorno and ‘Modernity: An Unfinished Project’ by Habermas.\n\nA lot of this includes Modernist stuff(especially Eliot's Waste Land) and I wonder if there's any theoretical frameworks I ought to familiarize myself with that would help me better understand this stuff? Any kind of background readings or \"milder\", less complex literature that will help me get a grasp of this stuff? I am not familiar with this kind of literature at all.",

        "text": "So many years ago I read E.D. Hirsch's [Validity in Interpretation](https://www.amazon.com/Validity-Interpretation-E-D-Hirsch/dp/0300016921/) and subscribed to his ideas on reading and criticism, which are probably closest to the theories of Post-Structuralism, Pyschoanalysis, and Structuralism. That is, the text should be studied with regard to its place within time, culture, the readers, and the author's intentions in order to establish its meaning and significance.\n\nI haven't done any serious study on literary criticism in several years, and am looking to get back into things. So I'm looking for books/critics along this train of thought to improve my understanding of where modern theory stands. Would also love to hear the strongest arguments against these ideas as well.\n\nI don't know of any modern critics who wrote much about this, aside from the late Christopher Hitchens. I suppose Lionel Trilling was an older critic that I enjoyed reading. Anyway this 'Hirschian' school of thought seems to exist separately from Marxism, Feminism, etc. But to be honest I'm fairly ignorant about how literary theory stands today, as my English studies mostly centered around older 20th Century theories like New Criticism, etc. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",

I wish I came from an English speaking country or at least in the northern hemisphere area such of that I cannot even begin to resolve and imagine these details.\n\nMy question would be: Are there any resources (such as tables) that would directly compare the terms and names to their looks (pictures), please?

For instance, is *Watt* a Modernist novel? Is *The Lost Ones* Postmodernist? or is there enough to make a case for either side?",

However, I struggle to find direction in picking out some contemporary writers to also focus on. Folks who are actively publishing would be best. I'm interested in what folks here might suggest.",
