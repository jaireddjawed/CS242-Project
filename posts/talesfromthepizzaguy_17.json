        "text": "I typically order from the same pizza place 3-4 times a month, each order ranging from $30-45. This place is located roughly five minutes away by driving. The last few orders I placed there were small mistakes such as hot wings instead of mild, crushing one side of the pizza by stacking wings on top of the box etc. I always tip 10% and choose not to make a fuss. \n\nThe last order I placed was $45, when the driver delivered it he was in a rush so he set the food down, charged my card then started handing me the food before I realized that my wings were missing. I've lurked this sub for a while and enjoy seeing the other side of things and understand that delivery is a luxury and tipping is appreciated, however I couldn't get over the fact that I wanted to take the tip back because of what happened. The drivers response was a shrug of the shoulders and to call the store and wait 30 mins for the wings to arrive....\n\nWas I right in feeling that this outcome didn't warrant a tip or would there have been a better way to handle it? Is it standard practise to give the food then charge, or charge first then provide the food?",

        "text": "This is going to sound like a clustertruck, and it is. We did things in a way that shouldn't have been done, but the customer wanted it that way and would not take the time and money-saving options we offered.\n\nWe service a military base, a relatively large one, but not the biggest in the country. We aren't on post itself, like one of our competitots, so we don't HAVE to deliver to the whole base, so we drew a hard line on our boundaries when it came to ranges and bivouacs. One such place wanted to place 22 deliveries, but they provided an address that was extremely close (like, 2 minutes away close) to an inexperienced CSR who started running the orders in. Unfortunately, after asking the customer if they wanted to just put the orders all together (getting the specials applied to the whole order and saving over 100 dollars in delivery fees), they declined saying that everyone was paying separately and wanted their own change. They also wanted all their orders delivered at the same time, we tell them some of the orders might not be as fresh as others, they say that isn't a problem, hungry soldiers who have been out at the ranges for a week with just MREs aren't picky. Okay, I take the hit as I am up next for the first order and decide, with all the other drivers and manager, to take the whole cache of them in my little saturn coupe.\n\n3 orders in, the first delivery is processed and sent to the board. I look at the address, realize it is the address for the base housing building, and ask my GM to help the CSR get the real address. Person on the phone gets irate, says they were told to use that address. GM confirms they are not at the housing building, but actually out at a base encampment that is roughly 15 minutes out of our already generous delivery radius, and tells them that we can either cancel the orders and they can order elsewhere, come pick up the orders for much less (no delivery fees, better in-store specials, etc), or, as an extension of good faith, meet me (at the time of the orders, most experienced driver) somewhere within our delivery area. They decide on option C.\n\nI'm, admittedly and with permission from manager, clocking orders for the bunch to myself while manning the oven so that our otherwise very busy night can flow smoothly to the other drivers who are all having moderate to pretty good nights (I like to keep tabs, make sure morale is good, and add mental notes to addresses that are either new customers or new to me).\n\n22 delivery orders later, I have a pocket full of receipts, thankfully with full first and last name (as they were all ordering from 3 different phones) of each customer, and take about 2/3 of our heat bags and have my little 3 door coupe filled to the brim to the meeting spot. At meeting spot, I call customer and ask where they are. They say they are at the spot, I say, \"No, I'm at the spot.\" So they want to send me a pin on apple maps, tell them I'm on an old samsung, they send the gps data through text, phone won't read it. I call them back, mention a place nearby, and they okay. I make my way there, pass a humvee without giving it a second thought, and am about halfway to new meeting spot when boss calls. \"Whatever moron you talked to gave you the wrong new spot. Their driver said they passed you (my car was very discernible. Even without the cartopper, people in the area would shout my store name at me as I rolled by) by the meeting spot. Here's their number.\" I call the new number, arrange a meeting spot closer to the original, but also has more room on the shoulder for their humvee and my car.\n\nNow the fun. While waiting for them to show at original location, I totaled up the cash amount, to try to make it easy. Nope. They wanted to do each cash transaction individually, and get their full change back. Fine, whatever. I notice that at least the two who were present leave 2-3 dollar tips on their credit card slips, and zero out the rest. Fuck me. After giving exact change (fortunately I had two change jars hidden in my trunk for emergencies and also decided to take my time about writing down how much I received and gave back so my balance was correct at the end) for 14 orders, they handed me a 10 dollar bill as a tip for the entirety of the non-present people.\n\nSo, all tolled, I made 22 dollars on fuel, 14-16 on tips, and lost out on 3 hours of deliveries. Averaged out, those 22 deliveries were next dollar up territory. GG GM gave me an additional 15 fuel for driving around like a dummy. Almost made it worth it :') At least I hold the store record for most deliveries at once. It's a title I wear with pride and salt.\n\nBonus: That area is explicitly prohibited from ordering delivery to a meeting spot in the future.",

We're located in a small, college town in a quaint little state. There's not a \"bad area\" on our delivery zone and we've never ran across safety concerns for our drivers. \n\nBut I'm still concerned. Something I've been seeing lately is drivers are driving around their SO while on deliveries. Just taking them along for the ride... This is a common thing with two of the drivers here that I've witnessed, and I'm not sure if there's more during the day shift. \n\nThese drivers aren't on my shift though, so I CAN say something, but the time I show up to work their shift is already over. I've told one of the drivers it can't be happening and he needs to stop because of distractions, safety, and also it's just not good for the company to be seen with two people in the car. I told this to a guy that was working on my shift one night, when he tried getting a girl coworker (she was off the clock) to deliver with him. I let the GM know right away after the night was over and he didn't really say any comment on it. I haven't worked with him since so I don't know if anything has changed, since it's still not really being enforced. \n\nI showed up to work today and parked next to a delivery car. I looked over when I was getting out of my car and saw someone on their phone in the passengers seat. A girl who I've seen come in before as the girlfriend of one of the delivery drivers. I thought there was no use in talking to the driver since his shift will be over in 10 minutes. I know, I should have talked to him. \n\nI'm just really concerned. This isn'y good for the business. What if they get into an accident and the girlfriend gets killed? We'd get someone suing us or something. Or if for some unlikely reason someone tries to rob our driver... the poor girl shouldn't be apart of it. Or if the girl is distracting our driver and our deliveries start being late and customers complain... there's no positives to this. \n\nI don't even know what to ask... I've talked to the GM many of times about this and let him know every time this happens but he seems like he doesn't care. I guess I want to know what people's experiences are with this kind of stuff, if anyone here has taken along their SO, coworker, friend, etc, on a delivery, or if anyone has ever had experience with someone from their store doing this.

But everyone noticed the order with those instructions in the instruction area of the receipt when it was on the screen, so the guys were discussing who was going to take it. Not fighting or rearranging, but they definitely were all curious who would go. The guy who happened to take it is the kind of guy that looks like a surfer dude on the beach. That is so not his personality, but if he was an actor that would be his casting type. Or maybe young doctor, whichever. So off he goes.\n\nCast: M=Me, F=female voice, D=driver\n\nA bit later the phone rings, female voice asks for the manager so I say, \"how can I help you?\" In my normal cheery voice, because if I'm gonna hear a complaint I like to get positive as I can beforehand.\n\nGirl goes off about how she put in the notes field about delivering her pizza with a wink, and she did not get her freaking wink. So terrible customer service, and I dunno I stopped listening.\n\nM: I'm sorry you didn't get the customer service experience you requested.\n\nF: You're sorry? Well, what are you going to do about it?\n\nM: Well I am sorry, but whether a driver winks or does not wink has to be the drivers decision. (girl starts to go OFF about what terrible customer service this is, I firmly interrupt.) I am **sorry** but there is no way we are going to force a driver to wink at anyone as that would be along the lines of **sexual harassment** and CLICK (she hung up.)\n\nSo not five minutes later the driver comes back.\n\nM: So you didn't wink?\n\nDriver non-commits, goes to do necessary stuffage\n\nM: No I'm perfectly fine with your choice not to wink. I'm just curious what happened since I just got yelled at about it.\n\nD: Well, honestly this girl looked to be no older than 15, and her grandma was standing right behind her shoulder. It was all just weird.\n\nM: Ah, that sounds like you made a wise choice.\n\nD: Also she was wearing a bikini. It was just really creepy.\n\nHoly heck do I now wonder what was going through this person's mind. Was she trying to mess with granny? What the heck was going on? I forgot to take a pick of the receipt. Sorry.\n",

I head back and double check my address and head up the stairs. I knock and must've startled everyone, since the dog started barking and no one immediately came to the door. \n\nSomeone peaked outside and I said \" Got a couple of large pizzas?\" \n\nHe replied, \" Hold on, let us put pants on\".\n\nNext time the door opened, a full grown pitbull lunged and bit firmly once on my leg as the owner failed to control him. I yelled some obscenities something like \"what the fuck your fucking dog bit me!\" Somewhat frantically because my leg was bleeding pretty badly.\n\nNow the guy is freaking out and says he didn't order pizza and I start trying to reason with the guy while trying to grit through the pain.\n\n\"Your dog bit me dude!\"\n\nHim: \" Well he must not have trusted you...I didn't even order pizza!\"\n\nMe, now walking down stairs muttering obscenities : \"Is your address XXXX st #X?!\"\n\nHim: \"Yes but you just trespassed I didn't order fucking pizza!\"\n\nMe: \" Control your dog it just bit me man! Look I have your address (showing him the delivery receipt) I'm just doing my job!\"\n\nHis wife: \"You better get out of here before I call the cops!\" \n\nMe: \"I'm leaving fuck off!\"\n\nI call the store, and get the cops involved. Leg is now bleeding pretty badly and I'm nursing it with my napkins scattered among the crushed red peppers among my car and water from an old water bottle. \n\n\nCome to later find out that the address was given incorrectly over the phone. That'd explain all the crazy behavior. I was just trying to do my job... :/ \n\nAlso the cops were no help, failing to see how I was just trying to d my job. He went as far as to insinuate I'd have a problem with him (the officer) if I tried delivering a pizza to his house without him knowing late at night. I drove off in a huff after the lady said \"well, he's a pitbull and he was defensive...\". I screamed into my hands after I drove off because those are the type of pet owners that reinforce negative stereotypes surrounding innocent dogs...\n\nThe guy who ordered the pizza showed up, paid, and apologized profusely, then didn't tip. Had another pizza to deliver which was surely cold at this point, and delivered it with blood dripping down into my sock. The girls heard about it at the next house since they impatiently called the store wondering where their pizza was, unbeknownst their driver was chomped by a pup doing an angry.  They snapchatted my injury, tipped me $1, and I was on my way.\n\nI made &gt; $100 tonight. Was it worth? Meh.\n\nTLDR: show up. Naked customer with loud dog. Clothed customer fails to contain pit bull who chomps my leg. Wrong address all along after cops showed up.\n\nAny dog attack stories for me? I can't sleep after the insinuating ER visit and the adrenaline rush from the whole situation.\n\n(Also thanks whoever read this far...)",

First question, \" how do I order online?\"\n\nGo to ****.com/order online.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nSo busy couple of days, but I thought I'd come flesh this out. I was browsing reddit while on the phone with this lady, that is how much she needed my help. A few of the questions, with my answers as well as I can remember, to follow.\n\nBackground, she wanted a special we are not allowed to give out in the store. We were not *too* busy, but we weren't dead, but I was the only insider in the store. Me, two drivers, that's all.\n\nAlso, there was a lot of periods where she was discussing what was going on and what she needed with what sounded like several people in the background, and several long pauses, but I won't be relaying those parts.\n\nLady \"I don't know how to order online, I need you to talk me through it.\"\n\nMe \"Okay\"\n\nL \"So what do I do\"\n\nM \"go to ***.com order online\n\nL \"and then what\" Before I can answer she answers herself, which is good because I can't remember what the layout says.\n\nL \"okay I'm on the pizza. I just want cheese, how do I get just cheese?\"\n\nM - dumbfounded\n\nL \"I see pork, beef, blah, blah, blah, light, normal, extra (whatever it says I wasn't strictly paying attention) I don't want any of that stuff!\"\n\nM \"So don't... pick it?\" I honestly said that. I really don't know how I got away with that, I think it was rude, but I guess she wasn't paying attention?\n\nL \"okay so how do I, oh okay.\"  Longish pause, which I said I wasn't relaying but apparently I'm rather untrustworthy. \"So now it says choose an address. What do I do?\"\n\nM \"Do you have an address saved?\" Probably not, right? I mean, she didn't even know the website.\n\nL \"All the addresses are blank, what do I do?\"\n\nM \"Add an address?\" Seriously, nearly every remark I made was hesitant because I truly thought she was f**king with me. She obviously knew how to do the basic stuff on the computer, and everything I told her she had ether found by the time I told her, or she found instantly afterwards.\n\nL \"okay so its in my cart, it won't let me send it though. Why won't it let me send it?\"\n\nM \"Do you have the minimum purchase in the cart?\" Because I pretty much knew she did not.\n\nSo from there it devolved into her being quite upset because she wanted just a single cheese pizza delivered for $8. It isn't worth our time. (Not overlooking the irony of how much of my meaningless life's minutes were used up by this farce.) She refused to add anything to the order, got fed up with the whole 'net thing and just had me charge her full price to send her a single cheese pizza. Nothing else. Wanted a deal, but I told her honestly, even if I had any sort of a deal for her that would just take the delivery to below our minimum and we wouldn't be able to deliver it. And when I mean honestly, by this time I had given up on \"nice\" and was going for straightforward honest. She didn't give me sass, or get upset at all from what I can tell, so I ended up respecting her a bit even though the whole thing was a poop move. And while I was on the phone with her I couldn't take calls from other customers, make pizza, drop wings... but I did get to reddit for a moment.\n\nTLDR: The reason the most companies create websites is to avoid paying employees to talk on the phone. Passive aggressive stuff like this only makes it worse. \n\n",

It just felt too far from morning and not close enough to night for this to truly be her pajamas.  (sure, maybe she partied all night, who knows)\n\nAs she turned to motion where the money was (on the desk by the bed--why didn't she just bring it to the door?), the cut-out sleeves of her shirt provided an unobstructed view of some major side boob.  She wasn't showing everything, but she definitely wasn't trying to hide anything either.\n\nShe invited me all the way in--which rarely happens (in fact, we're supposed to NOT go in, even when invited--but I usually ignored that rule).  As the door closed behind me, she walked over to the desk where the money was and bent down in a very unnatural way that caused the back of her T-Shirt Dress to ride up ALMOST to where I could see if she was wearing underwear.\n\nNaive 19 year old me thought nothing of it and tried not to be a creeper and stare.  I respectfully carried out the transaction and went on my way thinking no more of the incident except in fleeting thoughts when I passed that motel on deliveries.\n\nTHEN I got a delivery to her again the next year.  Same hotel.  Same chick.  Same flipping Harley Davidson T-Shirt.  Same routine--oh the money's on the dresser, one sec, awkward bend...  Except THIS time, she takes a camera off the desk and says \"Would you take a picture of me for my boyfriend back in Missouri?\"  \n\nShe sits down on the bed and poses with her legs crossed over each other as I snap a photo.  Nothing blatantly inappropriate, definitely trying to be sexy--but it was for her boyfriend, right?  Right??  Looking through my older, now-jaded eyes, was there something going on here that I just missed in my innocent youth?  \n\nI delivered to her a third time, and at that point I said something to my coworkers.  Two of them knew exactly who I was talking about.  They had similar experiences with her.\n\nIs the Pizza Guy Fantasy a real thing?  Any of you have any experiences of the same nature?",

Soon as we see the pizza on screen, we know it's her.\n\nShe's very shy and quiet, so every driver that delivers to her just sort of stands their awkwardly since small talk will never happen since she won't respond. She tips $3 every time, and then we're on our way back.\n\nAll I can hope is that she's okay. A few of us are kind of worried about her, we know it's depression but we don't really think there's anything we can do except give her a smile and wish her a great day. \n\nAfter all, we might be the only friendly faces she sees.",

        "text": "We had a Domino's in the next town over (small college town) owned by the same franchisee as my normal store, and I would volunteer to go drive for them when it was busy or if they were short.  It seems one summer I was working more hours over there than my home store.\n\nWhat I learned delivering in this college town was that you tend to make money more on volume than tips.  You take an INSANE number of deliveries (at the time you got $.75 per delivery) to the dorms all night long, but poor, broke college kids would rarely tip.  One night, I started getting fed up and mildly lost it.\n\nThis one bastard, we'll call him Bastard, because lulz...  Good ole Bastard orders $19.92 worth of pizza.  Gets as close to $20 as he could.  I got to his apartment and he meets me out on the porch, hands me a $20. In my mind, I resign to my fate...  OK I'm not getting tipped.  No big deal.  Par for the course.  I'm about to say thank you, have a good day.\n\nThen he says it...  \"Keep the change.\"  And it wasn't to inform me that he didn't actually want me to go through the trouble of counting out change, he said it with this cheeky smirk and lingering eye contact that absolutely boiled my blood.  Normally, I would take this all in stride, but not tonight.\n\n\"Really.  Really!?  Keep ALL 8 cents, all for myself??  Oh thank you!\" I exclaimed.  I reached my left hand in my pocket where I kept my money and I grabbed a few random coins and flicked them at his feet.  As they bounced around the porch, I continued, \"Here, you probably need it more than I do\" and I stormed off.\n\nIn hindsight, sure, there were a million reasons why ole Bastard didn't tip, and I wasn't really owed any more than the $19.92, but I have to admit it felt good to set him back on his heels and see his jaw hang open as the coins rolled around the porch.  (and I certainly don't condone being a dick in a customer serving position)\n\nLucky for me, my manager was the most chill guy ever, so when I got back to the store, (he had already received the call), we just laughed as I told him what happened.\n\nHave you ever lashed out at a customer, warranted or otherwise?  I'm all ears.",

I worked from 11:30 - 4:00 and when I left we were on order 14.\n\nSo I go to take that last order before clocking out, and I look at the receipt to make sure I didn't have anything wrong.\n\nIt was $7.24.\n\nWith delivery charge and tax.\n\nI figured they had some credit on there or something... or some other thing, but it didn't say anything about a credit on the reciept. So I'm left to believe that through some magic, this person ended up getting 2 medium pizzas for the price of less than one.\n\nSo I drive there, fully expecting no tip at all. It sucks, because the last delivery I took before this was literally 2-3 hours ago, so I'm wanting to actually make money.\n\nI get there, and she notices the amount.\n\n\"what\"\n\"yeah idk did you use a coupon\"\n\"no\"\n\"well shit lmao. Check your bank account to make sure that we didn't overcharge you but the receipt says you owe us no cash so good on you\"\n\nFor some reason she did the runaround of \"but the website said\" and me going \"but the receipt said, go check your bank to make sure you were charged correctly\"\n\nI knew it wasn't an issue of an incorrect receipt because I double checked everything. \n\nSo we sort of have a chuckle about it. Moreso just me and her just being like \"uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\", but no matter. Good on her I guess, she gave me a $3 tip.\n\nSo I drive back to the store, and I hear a phone call! Me, being the wonderful worker that I am, decide to pick it up!\n\n\"You didn't put extra sauce on my pizza\"\n\nAnd this is how you get 4 medium pizzas for $7\n\nGod bless small towns.",

Sure as shit most of them happen at every store though. \n\n1. No I don't carry extra dips. They're 49p each or 3 for £1 when you place you order. If you want extra dips, order extra dips. \n\n2. \"Ring me when you're outside\" when I ring you and then you ask me to ring the buzzer. This is not ok. When I ring you and you don't answer. this is also not ok. \n\n3. Do not place an order if you're not currently at your address. And won't be for the next 20 mins. Could be quiet and your order gets made and delivered within 15-20 mins. The driver is not obliged to wait for you. \n\n4. \"Oh it's only £1\" yes you're right! It's only £1. £1 that comes out of *my* pocket, not the company's. \n\n5. Don't bitch to the driver that your order is late. Driver doesn't care, driver has most likely done 1 delivery before yours and has 2 more waiting in the car to be delivered. If you have a complaint, speak to the manager. Making a driver's life hell just because you had to wait 10 extra mins is gonna get you nowhere. \n\n6. If your drivers looks cold or wet because of the weather, don't point out to them how shitty the weather is as you step back into your nice warm, dry house. The driver _knows_ how bad the weather is AS THEY WERE OUT IN IT. \n\n7. If you're having a bad day, do not take it out on the driver. They're most likely having a shitty day too. \n\n8. If you work in an office and expect the driver to deliver to your fuckin desk, we don't. We're not insured to be in your building and also don't have the time to wander around an office block looking for someone named 'Matt' because you didn't include your surname or company. \n\n9. If you live in incredibly close proximity to the store i.e you're over the fucking road, make everyone's life easier, come and collect. \n\n10. if you've ordered for delivery, LISTEN OUT FOR THE FUCKING DOOR. Don't ring the store saying the driver never turned up, because they did and left again. \n\nYou are not owed anything from us. We don't charge for delivery and in the UK you're not obliged to tip. So when you expect all these things from your driver, realise you're the unreasonable one. ",

Im surprised thinking hes giving me a tip. Nope, I get to my car and I count out $19.75 cash. I immediately realized that this dumbass isnt leaving me a tip, but instead he forgot that he already paid for his food through credit card. I almost considered calling him and telling him - which I would have done for anyone else. Im now about $20 richer and very satisfied.",

The first 2 hours weren't anything unexpected,  did about 400 in sales at the, slower then usual, but whatever, easy day. \n\nThen it starts raining. Hard as hell, and anyone who works pizza knows it gets busier. This was busier than busy.  We had 4 insiders tonight, 2 on the makeline, 1 on the phones and front counter and me on the oven. Heat rack is constantly full, and about 15 minutes in, a driver comes back saying they can't deliver to A st cause it's flooded. That's fine, put the order back on the heat rack, then B st is flooded, and C, and D, and the entire section of one neighborhood is completely unreachable due to flooding.\n\nHalf of our delivery area was unreachable due to flash flooding, and half of our drivers were new and not as comfortable driving in the rain, so delivery times were in the 1.5 hour range, because they were leaving the store until 45 minutes afterwards. Also, one of our driver's was rounding a curve and didn't see the road flooded and ended up.messing his car up, so we were short a driver as well.\n\nFor a solid 2 hours, it was nothing but ringing phones, making pizzas, and trying to find room for pizzas, since the entire heat rack, top of the oven, side of the ovens, bottom oven (not running) were full of pizza and sides, and they were still coming. Overall we did almost 1800 in 2 hours, and another 1100 the 1.5 hours after that, including $250 worth of cancelled orders that couldn't make it to their destination. Everyone got off almost 2 hours later than usual, and although it was hell, we only had 1 messed up order and make line forgot to make 2 things that were quickly made.

        "text": "This was my very last night at a big 3 store, so I was dangerously low on fucks to give. \n\nPhone rings, I pull up customer info while waiting for the real ring (there's 30 seconds of ads) and I see an address I had noticed earlier. It looked like a typo of an address for a nearby hotel so I figured they were having trouble getting their order. \n\nI pick up and on the other end is a breathless woman who is obviously upset. \n\nShe explains multiple times and will not shut up for me to even ask a question for a second. I'll save you the long version. Here's the deets:\n\nShe received a call from her delivery biker and had to hurry out to meet him so that's why she's out of breath, it was a long way from her location (and up and then down again a couple flights of stairs) to where the delivery guy was supposed to be. \n\nShe is upset that he was not there to meet her.\n\nShe tried calling him back a few times and it went straight to VM and she thinks he's trying to avoid making her delivery. \n\nShe gave an address for the order that technically was the address of the place she is in and put call on arrival, expecting to then tell him where to meet her when they did. Something went wrong during this process. \n\nOkay, I think, we'll sort this out. \n\nI finally manage to get her to calm down and let me ask a few questions to clarify what's going on. \n\nThe address was right, but it was a park. *red flag #1*\n\nShe is in this park at after 11 at night *red flag #2* that has just finished up a huge weekend festival celebrating an intoxicating substance *red flag #3 but claims she is working (probably security or cleanup detail). \n\nSo now at this point I'm thinking the biker has either deemed this a likely robbery attempt and gotten the fuck out of there, or he really did lose phone connectivity or battery power, or something like that. But she seems so earnest I talk to her a little more trying to figure out what the deal is.\n\nI confirm the address with her and she admits she is deep inside the park, far away from any of the entrances. This park is one of three connected parks that are actually MILES LONG running down the shore in our city. They are cut off from all access by fenced train tracks, except for a couple of pedestrian bridges and one street level entrance at the far end. Because of my low fuck supply, I tell her politely that it is highly against policy for us to deliver to parks as it can be a safety risk. \n\nThe address she had given was for the street level entrance, which is pretty nearby our store, but the place she wanted to meet the delivery person was actually an entire mile away at one of the pedestrian bridges. Also about 15 minutes for her to walk to from where she was working, as she admitted. It doesn't have its own address, but there are several small businesses on the street there that she could have used their addresses for getting her order closer to her location. \n\nBut the worst part, that actual physical location is out of our delivery area and we never violate that. It's also a huge red flag and a dick move to order your delivery to one address but need it taken out of area. It's a form of cheating the system. \n\nI tell her I need to put her on hold to try to call the biker and to get a manager so we can find out what's going on. \n\nPhone list isn't handy and biker is borrowed from another store anyway, so I just tell manager exactly everything I told you, emphasizing the red flags and the map I had pulled up showing that her location she wanted the biker to meet her at was 1 full mile away and very out of our delivery area.\n\nHe grabs the phone to talk with her and I walk away because I have other work to do. \n\nThe biker made it back to the store a moment later and I give him a very quick description of the call that's going down and ask him if his phone battery died or what. Yeah, it was dead. He didn't understand where she had wanted him to go and tried to get more than just \"that distinctive bridge up the road aways\" (using its name) since he'd never been there or seen it and it was out of our area.\n\nManager ended up giving her a mostly sorry but explained policies her order violated were strict and there for a reason. He told her we would not be delivering to her there at all. And he refunded her payment to her card, letting her know her money should be back around three business days. \n\nI was proud of him for that. \n\nBut my bafflement remains that the customer thought any of that shit she did was even remotely okay. Ugh. ",

I pull out and I hear their engine scream, seeing them quickly speed up behind me in the rear view, only to slam on their brakes and horn as if I nearly killed them. Guess who called the store 10 seconds later asking for the manager? Was a bitchy old lady, she said I almost killed her and demanded a free pizza and asked me to be fired. Obviously, she was hung up on. \n\nI've had too many people to count pull out of side roads 50 feet in front of me while I'm going 35. \n\nI don't see this shit when I'm off the clock.

        "text": "I've worked in a western Washington Dominos store for the last 11 months, and am entirely fed up with incompetent and malicious management. \n\nI'm using a new side account to stay anonymous.\n\n1.Serious ant problem. The little fucks are everywhere. I've seen them trailing in and out of the walls, and even on bread that we've cut only 20 minutes previous.\n\nEverytime someone tries to set out traps or do anything to get rid of them, the upper managers get pissy because \"what if oer/ the health department comes in and sees bug traps? Leave the ants be, they won't even notice\"\n\n2. No one knows how to clean.\n\nYou can't even see into the oven, there's so much grease caked onto the windows.\n\nOur pans and prep containers are disgusting. Everytime I go to grab containers, they're stuck together because they weren't dried before stacking and there's caked on who-the-fuck-knows on half of them.\n\nThe pans are constantly greasy, and when out cleaning supply supplier^tm\nLast came in, she had to inform us that our pan detergent was still completely full. She only comes once every week, and in a full week, litterally none of the pan cleaner was used. We go through a minimum of 30 pans a day.\n\nThere were no pans in the sink.\n\n\n3. I'm surprised this food hasn't killed anyone. \n\nIf you've worked in a pizza place, you're probably familiar with the term \"picking the pits\".\n\nFor the uninitiated, that's where you reach into the grates to pick out te toppings that missed the pizza while you were chucking them on, and throw them back into the make-line.\n\nAlready a kind of gross practice, but forgivable.\n\nWhat isn't forgivable is taking the nasty, soggy, warmed cheese left in the pits, throwing it into a container and calling it \"specialty cheese\". \n\nThe cheese that is strewn with chunks of pineapple, mushrooms, and probably the occasional human hair is then thrown into any of our specialties because \"I'm sure they won't notice\".\n\nMy GM is deathly allergic to pineapple and red peppers, and refuses to even touch them. \n\nShe sees no problem with this.\n\n4. Expiration dates aren't a suggestion.\n\nPan pizzas are only good for a couple of hours after prepping, but apparently allowing them to sit at Room temperature for 8 hours before throwing them into the walk-in to be used the next day (or the next day) is totally cool.\n\n\"Wait, we have 5 trays of dough that expired two days ago? No! Don't throw that away! We'll just turn it into parm bites and use it for another two days!\"\n\n\"Breads only good for a day after being cut? Nah, it's fine. There's mold on one piece? Well, throw that one away and we'll just use the rest of the bag first.\"\n\n5. The only time I value is my own.\n\nA tier 1 manager that's been working at the shop for nearly 2 years is demoted and has her hours cut.\n\nWhy? \n\nFor two years she's said that she can't work closing. She picks up a couple of closing shifts because the gm is \"busy\"\n\nDespite numerous protests, she's scheduled to close 5 nights a week to close. She finally puts her foot down.\n\nShe is now unable to continue school because she can't afford to quit. \n\n50 year old man with dependent children has a massive house fire.\n\nHe calls in and asks for a week off to figure things out for his family.\n\nEvery day he's gone is counted as a 'no-call no-show' because the gm just doesn't like him.\n\nHe's immediately fired.\n\nGM was brought in by hiring manager with the understanding that she would work closing shifts.\n\nTwo months later she moved herself to working 4hours per week, 35 of which are day shift. Three people are now no longer being scheduled at  \nall, in the limbo of \"do I even fucking work here? Am I fired? What?\" None of this is talked about, it just happens.\n\nThe entirety of the day csrs and 4/5 day drivers are colluding to quit. As are a chuck of the night workers.\n\nEveryone hates everything, including the six people I've known that have worked at this very store and quit in the last year.\n\nFree me from this pizza prison.",

        "text": "So as I mentioned in my last post I've recently moved from California to Texas for grad school. Things have been shitty. I've had to replace my tires, I've fucked up my car a little by being stupid, and moving is just expensive in general. But I'm surviving a little.\n\nTo help me earn some money, I decided to do some driving for UberEATS. For those that don't know what this is, this is a program to where people can order their favorite food from participating food places (both restaurants and fast food places) and get it delivered to their door by uber drivers. \n\nDriving for this had actually been super helpful for me financially. While waiting for the Pizza Hut here to start me off, it's been nice being able to earn some cash driving around and delivering on my own schedule. Plus it's gotten me familiar with the lay of the land out here, which has made me a better Pizza Hut driver already.\n\nHowever, things have gotten interesting. I'll post more stories eventually but I'll start with this one.\n\nSo the thing about where I live is that I'm right by two big universities. I live really close to the one that I'm attending, but the other isn't too far away. So I have a lot of deliveries going out there. Fine enough, there's a lot of small eateries out there that look nice. So I pick up my order and go to deliver it.\n\nBeing from California, I am a master of the California stop. I mean, it makes sense, right? You slow down, see if anyone is passing, and if the steeet it empty, there's no reason for me to have to do a full stop, especially if the other way of traffic has a stop sign too.\n\nSo I'm casually strolling along, contemplating why someone desperately wants a pita bread sandwich delivered to them, when the lights of Apollo flash on me...\n\nSome fuckface stops in the middle of ongoing traffic to pick up a random dude on the street. Me, being the sensible man that I am, decided to flip him off and honk because he is creating a danger on the street.\n\nSuddenly, the lights of Athena flash... it's the police.\n\nI assume it's for the guy in front of me. So I decide to just get out of the way, but this is only a one way street. So we're going for a bit, and I see him turning left. So I figure, \"hey, let's turn right so I can get the cops off of me so they can get their man\"\n\nAt the last second, I see it. The sign that seals my fate.\n\n\"One-Way Only\". With a big sign pointing to the left.\n\nI book it to the parking lot nearby to do u-turn. Luckily for me, I figured the cops were off my trail.\n\nI was the criminal. \n\nSo my hoe ass just sits there. Waiting. Patiently, not sure if I was going to get my ass beat for being Hispanic.\n\nThe traffic stop goes actually pretty fine, they're both very nice and talked to me about my move to California, and let me off with just a written warning. They didn't even get mad at me for going on a one way, they were just like \"yeah be careful\"\n\nThe only problem was... because of this, I spent 30 minutes sitting at this college parking lot, with this mans pita dreams slowly dissolving into despair. Additionally, Uber shows where you driver is, so I know this man can see me. He can't see the police, but he knows my ass is parked for 30 minutes like a mile from his house. So I prepare for the worst. I have a good amount of stories in my head as I pull up to the house. Guy is already out there, probably contemplating what in his life brought him to wait over an hour for his pita surprise.\n\nI expect to hear screaming.\n\n\"Hey man, how was that delivery at (college)\"\n\nGod bless America. This man didn't even know how much he saved my ass.\n\n\"Hahah yeah the dude just took forever to come out of the dorm he was like im the shower and he was a total dick\"\n\nWe talked a little more, with him genuinely fine receiving his pita bonanza a little cold, and he tipped me like $2 (which for Uber you're not expected to tip so anything is great)\n\nThank you Mr. Pita Man for saving me 5 seconds of embarrassment.\n\nUberEATS is crazy and I already have a stockpile of stories ready to go\n\nHelp me",

By a lot I mean I probably spend close to 300$ at Pizzahut a month and maybe 100-200 at Dominos a month (I have an addiction dont judge). As well I always tip 20% despite being a broke full time worker living on my own.\n\nWhenever I do order however I usually order two 2L drinks one for just drinking with the food and the other two save for later or after work. A lot of times when I do order 2 the delivery driver only brings me one. It has happened enough times that it probably constitutes close to a 100$ just in soda itself.\n\nNow I hate complaining. Super hate it. I think it makes you seem like a asshole honestly. But this happens so often I am tempted at calling the store the next time it happens to mention it.\n\nUsually I just ignore the fact I am missing a second drink.\n\nAs well the nearest Pizzahut to myself is pretty far away, I am right on the border of their delivery zone, so the fact that I would have to complain makes me feel more guilty about it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about complaining and what would be the right way to go about it to not seem like a dick.",

Tipping makes me feel good and tipping complements make me feel even better.  Cheers!",

I accidentally cut off a van because I trusted their turn signal and turned in front of them. I had no trouble with the van however, not even a honk. The SUV behind him though had a problem with me. I realized something was off when he peeled out to catch up to me and followed me onto the next road staying extremely close without passing. It rattled me a bit so I sped up to get away and he followed. I got onto a back road and was going almost 90 mph and he still followed. I finally got back to the store where he pulled up behind me, phone in hand, and started taking pictures of me and my car. I asked him if he had a problem (politely) and he took it the wrong way. He proceeded to lecture me on driving safely and representing my company. I apologized endlessly. I was probably too polite but didn't want to escalate the situation. He finally left after seemingly cooling off a bit. Off a hunch I looked at our google reviews and found he had left one almost immediately after having left our parking lot. Of course it was one star and of course he mentioned me and my car, warning customers to \"look out for the silver wagon, he drives like a maniac\".  This is my first post here. I needed to get this off my chest after it left me so rattled. I know I made a mistake driving the way I did but I believe he took it way too far. Has anyone else had someone follow them? Am I just completely in the wrong here? ",

        "text": "A little background on myself:\n\n* Worked for Domino's Pizza for 5 years\n* Assistant Manager for 2 years\n* Acquired three OER 5 Stars (Operations Evaluation Report)\n\n\nBefore I start, a little info about this store. It was brand new (only open for 4 months as of now roughly), or rather this store moved to a new location (literally down the street) with a new oven, new pizza screens, and some stuff from the old store that was considered okay. The store was bigger and allowed for a sit down and eat area.\n\nAbout two months ago, I came into a local 2 Star OER (They haven't had above a 3 star in years) store that had just recently moved and offered to help train / bring them up to 5 star quality since I had worked for some pretty great Domino's stores before and knew what needed to be done and thought the new store would be a great reset button for them. I was to be a consultant and help train the GM and other employees the right way to do things. They also had just acquired 5 or so stores to be absorbed into their franchise so I was to help get them in shape to run all the stores properly... or so that's what I thought.\n\nFirst few weeks I spent identifying problems and suggesting to the GM what they needed to do to initiate the change. But even just after the first day I was appalled to see this store even running / selling food to people. This is something I need to share to bring awareness of just how disgusting some stores can be and still operate. If you do not wish to know and/or be disgusted, please leave this post now.\n\n---\n*It's a huge list so I'm just going to start listing what comes to mind as I type:*\n---\nDishes were barely washed. [(One example here)](http://i.imgur.com/2jrQ4Cq.jpg) They had grime coming off of them - you could take your finger and wipe it across and your finger would be oily with [some unknown stuff.] (http://i.imgur.com/McdcUbn.jpg) Turns out the dishwashers (who came in the morning before open) would just dunk them in [soapy disgusting water](http://i.imgur.com/VIEwNtg.jpg) that was never changed and put them in a \"clean\" water sink to get the soap off. They were never scrubbed or sanitized. Water is supposed to be above 90F or something like that (I don't remember I usually just use the guide that's posted above the sinks with the thermometer). They wouldn't lay out the dishes to dry but put them together wet, so they would never dry.\n\nI had suggested they needed a new cleaning crew or needed to be retrained as they were not doing their job correctly whatsoever. GM said \"Yes, I know they never do it correctly. I will try to see what I can do.\" This was the start of a red flag for me since he knows what's being done wrong and chose to do nothing. At first I brushed it off as okay maybe he'll get it done. From that point forward I started to get there early in the morning to rewash all the dishes as it was unacceptable. \n\nThis is a dish I had cleaned the night before, [as you can see they didn't even do anything to \"wash it\".](http://i.imgur.com/5zKWUUr.jpg)\n\nThe oven was never cleaned. The oven is a conveyor belt oven and has these trays that catch food that falls through the conveyor. It's usually at the entrance and exit of the oven. These things were never cleaned and filled with food that had mold coming off of it. I didn't get a picture of it unfortunately as I cleaned it right away. But here is a picture of one of the trays [a day after I cleaned it.](http://i.imgur.com/5Nc7Y3Y.jpg) Now imagine that accumulating for months and never cleaned. It was filled with cheese and toppings, I couldn't even see the bottom of it before I had cleaned it.\n\nThe oven also has these windows/doors on the side that allow you to peer into the oven to see if the dough is bubbling or to side load items for par-baking stuff, etc. I couldn't find any close up pictures of the oven as I haven't taken that many pictures. But here is a slightly blurry image of it: [here](http://i.imgur.com/2DxiAcb.jpg) Again this is a new oven so don't be fooled by its shiny exterior. The doors/windows on the side are supposed to be like glass... clear. These however, were not. They were completely brown/covered in grease. You couldn't see anything on the other side. You could shine a flashlight through it and nothing would go through. You usually clean it by spraying de-greaser and using a paint scraper to get all the shit off and then wipe it down. I spent probably 3 days of constant cleaning to finally get it clear again (granted it did have a little tint to the glass which is bound to happen with use). After fully cleaning it I showed everyone else how to do it and that they had to do it every morning before starting the oven so they didn't burn themselves. They never did it and now it's completely disgusting again and you can't see through it. (If I find a picture of it I will try and post it here)\n\nThat's not even the worse part, oh it gets much worse. You know how your pizza gets bubbles? Well at Domino's we're supposed to pop those bubbles with a poker because they're not supposed to get above a certain height or diameter. We use those side-doors to get access to the pizza. And boy, this is gonna gross you out. I had just gotten them to buy a bubble popper poker fork thing because they had never had one before. They had never washed it from when it came in the mail AND even after using it. Here's three days of the thing [not being washed](http://i.imgur.com/wIahwqs.jpg) Close up image [here.](http://i.imgur.com/RvyblCL.jpg) It may look meh/okay, but that black stuff is mold. This thing would not have been washed for weeks if I hadn't taken it and cleaned it myself a few times.\n\nYou think I'm done? Nope. How about the actual food now? It was never dated - I'm sure they used chicken that has been expired for days. I know for one that I had to throw away 3 bags of bread because of mold (3 bags of bread is 18 loaves - 6 per bag). Look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/QkNU2Mk.jpg), nothing is dated AND there's an open bag of chicken that would collect bacteria if not covered. Oh and you know how we put food away at night? None of it gets covered, it gets thrown on a cart and thrown in the walk-in. I didn't get a full picture of the cart but I did manage to get a picture of it when I walked in the morning to find this: [here](http://i.imgur.com/VJ4gFeu.jpg) (You can see the cart has toppings in 1/6 pans and none of it is covered)\n\nRemember how I said dishes weren't really cleaned? How's this for ultra gag factor. The bin that they use to hold the cheese for topping pizzas hasn't been washed in a month or more. They just keep throwing bags of cheese in on top of old cheese. At the end of the night they never switch to a clean bin (which you're supposed to do AND cover it). So you may be getting cheese that may be 3 weeks old because it was never emptied before refilling AND it was never cleaned so you may actually be getting month old cheese. Here's a picture of the [cheese bin](http://i.imgur.com/yGfLGdV.jpg) that was washed 3 days prior by me. (It's the leftmost one).\n\nPhew okay, well what's next. How about dough? Do you like your dough? Well how about dough that has been cornmealed, stretched, and sitting out for hours so it gets nice and crusty. They would pre-prep dough hours beforehand so they didn't have to stretch your dough when it was ordered allowing them to make it faster. Even after explaining the health hazards to the GM about this he shrugged it off. Dough that is cornmealed, stretched, and sitting out is only good for 30 minutes max depending on the dough's proof level, temperature, etc.\n\nWhen dough is not in use, it is to be covered to prevent it from getting crusty and disgusting. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/xEvJT4i.jpg) is some pan dough that was not covered and now has to be thrown out (except it wasn't - it was used). \n\nI could keep you here for hours describing the disgusting things of this store. The bottom line is, the health department could walk in at any moment and shut them down. \n\nYou may be asking yourself, if I'm the consultant why didn't I do anything to stop this behavior? Well, I did - I'm not in command. I was there to inform the GM what needed to be done and how to do it. I spent the first few weeks prepping food to better understand the stores problems.\n\nAfter a few weeks I wrote a full report on everything that needed to change. Week after week the GM kept pushing it off. Oh I forgot to mention in that time the GM now became the Franchise Supervisor. That supervisor was promoted to GM and now Supervisor without knowing how to do anything. He doesn't know how to prep food, clean things, make pizza, etc. Recently he has stated to me that if he were to work in one of my stores he would have gotten fired long ago. \n\nOkay, back to the drama of the inside now. Things weren't getting done, so I decided it was time for me to come into the store and start working inside with the others to help lead them in the right direction myself. I started working as a normal insider as of Tuesday of this week. I'm helping people top things correctly and stretch dough correctly when I'm approached by an \"Assistant Manager\" (Which they were not? but were? What) To stop telling people how to do things, the things I was doing were wrong. That she was the Assistant Manager, I had to do what she said because I was just a normal insider. What. I'm here to help train people I thought. Confused, I went to my now supervisor and asked what's going on. More drama, blah blah. Turns out she wasn't an Assistant Manager but they let her believe she is because she is a bitch and they need that bitchiness to get others in line. (This is legit what my supervisor said). \n\nThursday, I tell my supervisor who is now at the store out of uniform doing absolutely nothing other than sitting down that nobody is listening and everything is still being done wrong and I would like his help. I get a response along the lines of this: \"Oh, [Name] may get all the OER points but they don't run a 30k/week store so they don't understand how difficult it is to do things correctly. What works for us works for us and we're gonna stick to that.\" (Meanwhile Fenway (local to me) does 50k+ a week, they're open a lot longer than we are and they constantly do 5 Star OERs.) I also came from a store that did 35k+/week and had 4.5 - 5 star OERs which was not part of the franchise my Supervisor thought I came from.\n\nAnyway, after that comment I realized that they weren't going to change and they were going to keep bullshitting me about changing stuff. So I went in today and quit on the spot. I don't even know why they hired me as a consultant in the first place. Stores like this shouldn't be still running. I wish corporate seized their franchise and put new people in charge. This is just wrong. ",

This meant that anyone lurking outside was pretty noticeable. \n\nNow the front counter was the standard in this multinational chain, completely separating us from the customer area. On the counter we had a little charity box for a local charity. The charity very rarely came by to empty it so it was usually pretty full. \n\nThis is where the sketchy guy comes in. We'd seen him walking back and forth in front of the shop for a while, which as I've explained was weird. As a driver I took little notice, except that I passed him a couple times on my way to and from deliveries. \n\nI get back from one of these deliveries to find two police officers talking to the manger. I quickly get the gossip that this sketchy guy has suddenly rushed in, grabbed the charity box and legged it. He was quick, no one caught him or saw where he went. \n\nManager was pissed, I mean this was a charity box after all. So when the charity comes by to gives us another box we decided to try a deterrent like a chain. I suggested to the manager that maybe I could go pick up some glue from the hardware store next door, I bought the strongest stuff the hardware store had and we laugh at how it couldn't be stolen now (it felt like it was cemented in). \n\nWe kind of forget for a while, then a month later the sketchy guy was seen again. This time he doesn't hesitate just runs and grabs the box, this guy could have been an athlete he was so quick but that was his downfall (literally). He doesn't expect the resistance and face plants right in front of the door. With a pretty messed up looking face he fled. We called the police and filled them in but I don't know if he was ever brought in. ",

        "text": "Names changed to protect the innocent and the not so innocent. \n\nI worked as a delivery driver over a summer at a Pizza Hut in a small town after graduating high school, the manager \"Barb\" was related to \"Tim\" the assistant manager.\n\nI was the new guy so I got all the terrible shifts no one else wanted.  One of those shifts included delivering personal pan pizzas at 10:30am on Tuesday to the local little league games.   \n\nThe owner whom I never met was supporting the little league team and giving them free pizza on game days.  No one wanted to do these deliveries for obvious reasons. The main being you had to show up an hour earlier than normal and no one had ever gotten a tip. We also only had one of the large insulated pizza carriers and even with creative stacking you had to make multiple trips from your car and the place we dropped the pizzas off to was a good 1/5th of a mile from the parking lot.  \n\nI was told to deliver 15 cheese and 15 pepperoni personal pan pizzas to the coach \"Chuck\".  I lugged the big pizza carrier to the dugout and found Chuck.  Chuck asks me to give them to the person running the concession stand and they will give them to the players later.\n\nThe next week comes around and I deliver nearly the same order to concessions.  But this time Chuck catches me in the parking lot and gives me 40 bucks, apologies for not giving the 20 to me last week and thanks me. \n\nI wisely do not tell any of the other drivers about the tip and keep acting annoyed that I get the Tuesday shift.  Chuck keeps tipping me 20 for every delivery.  During that month, we hire a new driver, and Tim tells me that he scheduled the new guy for the morning shifts.  I make the mistake of telling Tim about the tip and that I don't mind doing the morning shift.  \n\nSchedule gets posted and Tim starts doing the little league deliveries himself claiming that it’s too annoying fighting with drivers about it.  I'm a little frustrated because obviously he just wants the easy tip but what can I do.  \n\nThe next month Tim gets a manager position in one of the other franchises that the owner owns and Barb starts doing the scheduling while they hire a new Tim.  I sense opportunity and ask for the Tuesday shift.\n\nTuesday rolls around and I'm told I'm supposed to deliver 25 cheese and 25 pepperoni personal pan pizzas to \"Peg\".  I pull up to the parking lot and Peg is already waiting for me.  I'm ready for the worst, you see Peg is the mother of this horrible family that the entire staff of the restaurant hates. Peg is also related to Barb and Tim and has a brood of terrible loud rude children.  They come in a couple of times a week for lunch buffet and Barb/Tim lets them eat for free. They always leave their table a massive mess, they never tip and are borderline abusive to staff.\n\nPeg tells me to give the pizzas to her and her four bratty children.  She gets super annoyed when I ask where Chuck is and yells at me to, \"DO YOUR FUCKING JOB\".\n\nI give the pizzas to the kids and her and go back to work.  Later that week I run into Chuck at the grocery store when I'm off shift, he recognizes me and we make small talk and then he asks me about Peg.  I start ranting about her family, how rude they are, how they never tip.  He asks if she tipped me on Tuesday, when I told him no he insisted that I take 20 bucks from him.  \n\nI quit a couple days later when I get a better paying job at a local movie theater.  I also started dating a waitress from the old place and she told me a lovely tale.\n\nAccording to her Chuck the coach was friends with the owner of the restaurant.  When I told Chuck about Peg and the tip he contacted the owner to complain about Peg pocketing the tip he gave her for the driver. This is when everything apparently unraveled, it turns out that we were only supposed to be bringing enough pizzas for the kids on the team.  Barb/Tim had been making 15-20 extra pizzas each week and then had Peg selling them to parents and siblings of the crowd and pocketing the money. This led to Barb being fired, when the owner came in to higher new management they found a history of theft and free food to friends and family of Tim/Barb that were being written off as comp/no show delivery food.  Tim was also fired and Peg and her family got blacklisted.\n\n\ntl;dr - Family of pizza fraudsters get caught and fired after stealing a 20 dollar tip.",

It's also absolutely pouring rain, a detail which will be important later. Thinking nothing of it, I go out on the delivery with my bank of about $30. I get to the customer's residence and hand over the pizza, and she gives me a $50 bill. Logic would assume if you planned to pay for a $15 bill with a $50 bill, you'd tell the pizzeria before the driver leaves to ensure the driver has enough cash on them to give you proper change. Not this woman. Instead, she just blankly stares at me and says \"that's all you have? I need more change\", to which I politely ask if she has anything smaller than a $50. Of course she doesn't, so she demands I take $6 of my own money from my wallet and give it to her as the rest of her change. Fine, nothing I can do about it, I'll get it back at the pizzeria later. It's taken five minutes at this point, and I'm absolutely drenched. Clothes completely soaked by the rain, all while this woman gives me a hard time about her change. All in all I got a tip of less than $2, but it's better than nothing. I finally get back to the pizzeria, and I'm met with a firestorm of questions from the owner asking why I didn't have change on me and why I made this woman leave her house in the pouring rain with her kids to go get change for me, neither of which is even remotely true. Turns out she called the pizzeria while I was driving back and was screaming at the person who picked up the phone, claiming I didn't have any change for her and that she had to go to the bank with her kids in the rain to get a smaller bill. I don't understand her need to lie- truly insane. Either way, as soon as the owner found out she gave me a $50 for her $15 bill, he realized she was just an absolute idiot and absolved me of any wrongdoing. That, plus she cursed and screamed on the phone and hung up before we could even get a single word in in response. Might be a good time to start a blacklist...",

        "text": "Okay so I finally decided to get out the pizza business a few months ago, but I have an interesting story about the most difficult customer I had to put up with in my 10 months as a driver. He will be GOM (Grumpy Old Man), I'll be me.\n\n* Me: Hi, welcome to BLAH BLAH. How can I help you?\n* GOM: Yeah. I want 2 pizzas with double cheese. And don't load it up with a bunch of DAMN sauce! \n* Me: Yes sir! So that's 2 large pizzas, double cheese, no sauce. Your total is $dollars.cents \n* GOM: *gets out check book, writes check, tears it out, gets paper cut on hand* Ouch! I almost cut my hand off! \n* Me: *smiles sympathetically* \n* GOM: That's what you want, isn't it?! YOU WANT MY HAND TO FALL OFF!\n* Me, very confused: Um... No sir I don't want that. If you'd like to have a seat, your order will be ready in 10 minutes.\n\nSo after GOM takes his seat in the lobby, I walk to the back to try and comprehend what just happened. But he's not done being a weird old man. His pizzas come out and I couldn't cut them fast enough. I just wanted him gone. I'm socially awkward and can't deal with people like him.\n\n* Me: Here are your pizzas sir! \n* GOM: You got any coupons for pot pies?!\n* Me, again confused: Um.. I don't think I do.\n* GOM: Oh okay. *takes pizzas*\n* Me: Have a great day sir!\n* GOM: You can't tell me what to do! It's illegal!\n* Me: *okay this has to be a joke. I smile and laugh a little*\n* GOM: *dead serious face* I'm serious. You can't! It's illegal.\n* Me: O_o  \n\nHe also made fun of my car. I drive a Kia Soul and the first thing he asked me was where I kept the squirrel cage. I think he was referring to the hamsters they have in commercials, but I don't even know. He was so strange. I don't really miss the pizza biz.\n\nEDIT: formatting\n\n",

I don't know about you guys, but the highschoolers in our range have the bad reputation of always showing up late, giving vague instructions, and tipping very poorly if at all. They're often times awkward and on the phone, or even prank call us (like today. It was largely unfunny and discordant). To make matters worse, these highschool orders tend to zerg rush our system right as someone leaves to deliver a triple to the same school!\n\nHow about you guys? Do you have any highschool/college delivery tales? Do tell, and best of luck!",

        "text": "This is actually my dad's story, and one the reasons I will always think my dad is super cool.\n\nBack before I was born, my dad was a pizza driver. One day he was making a delivery to a local hotel, which happened to be having elevator problems that day. Specifically, two occupants had been trapped inside for about 40 minutes before they finally got it going again. My dad arrived just in time to hear all the buzz about what just happened, and asked an employee where the stairs were. The employee said he could just use the elevator to which dad responded \"haha fuck that, I'm not gonna risk it.\" The employee laughed and said he didn't blame him. Everything was cool.\n\nThat is until Asshole Manager walks up having overheard their banter. Instantly my dad gets berated.\n\nAM: YOU CAN GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST DEGRADE THIS ESTABLISHMENT AND BLAH BLAH BLAH FUCK YOU, GET OUT.\"\n\nDad: (obviously surprised) uhh .......can I take the pizza to the room first?\n\nAM: Fine, but hurry up and get your ass out of here.\n\nMy dad made numerous other deliveries to the hotel in the following months and each time he was met with the same smug, condescending, stink eye from asshole manager. For the sake of keeping his job, he never dared do anything to escalate the situation; no matter how tempting. Until one fateful day...\n\nHe happened to be driving down a road near the hotel after a huge rain storm. As he's driving, he notices none other than asshole manager walking down the street, returning to work with his lunch. AM has his assistant walking about 10 feet behind him. He is also about to pass the world's biggest fucking road puddle. I don't consider myself a religious man, but God was smiling on my dad in this moment.\n\nMy dad slowed slightly to ensure absolute precision. Right as asshole steps next to the puddle, my dad FLOORS it, and watches as he gets coated with a gargantuan wave of pure, orgasmic, unadulterated justice.\n\nIn the rearview mirror, he saw a fuming, red-faced man with a soaked suit and presumably inedible food, tailed by a man who had fallen to the ground in laughter.\n\nLater that day he got a message from the assistant which was along the lines of \"dude, that was seriously the funniest thing I've ever seen, but we have to ask that you never come back, or we'll have to take legal action.\"\n\nTotally worth it",

Customers also seem to think that they are automatically entitled to a pair, even if they don't get the promo. \n\nJust had to drive across town to deliver a lady more glasses because 2 pairs wasn't enough! We've wasted more gas on these glasses trying to please customers by driving these stupid things around town than we do delivering pizza.\n\nWord of advice: just buy glasses at your local gas station and stop getting mad when you have to buy a pan at full price to receive you shitty cardboard glasses!",

When the whole damn apartment complex only numbers in the tripple digits. Just absolutely stupid.\n\nSo Im doing my thing.

This absolutely gorgeous woman opens the door and quickly closes it behind her like Im not gonna notice the absolute wall of weed smell coming out of the place. \n\nBlood shot eyes and dark hair. The magic combination. She's absolutely cheesin' as I hand her the pizza. She sings the bill, hands it back to me and as she turns back into her house, I ask her: Oh, would you like some red peppers?\n\nHer eyes light up: \"haha yes, thanks\". And as I hand her the goods she replies:\" You wanna come in and take a hit?\"\n\nTakes me a second to react. \"I wish I could, but I gotta get back to work. You have yourself a wonderful night!\"\n\nThat just completely made my night. So much dumb shit and this one silly interaction makes it all o-kay. ",
