I have since then completely quit porn and masturbation, started going to the gym 3 times a week, am now reading everyday, greatly improved my social skills, I’ve started going on 3+ mile walks everyday, I joined an MMA gym, and I’ve begun putting about 2 hours of my time everyday into my main passion, playing the French Horn. I have some friends who are also doing self-improvement, and they always tell me to stop playing video games because I probably have much better things I could be doing with my time. I agree that video games are not good for me, but I have yet to hear any ideas regarding alternative uses of my time. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know- playing video games completely kills my motivation so I want to break this habit as soon as possible.",

I have landed a part time job with the city and am also going to be working part time at an Under Armor store. The only problem is that i just feel like I am going nowhere with these jobs, and it will be hard to get to the goals that I have. Everything seems very out of reach and I really want to make more money, while getting these health problems figured out. I know this is all over the place..im just writing this out of desperation just to get some other peoples perspective on this. Thanks for hearing me out",

Making excuses can be damaging for lives and can lead to regret. By recognizing our own excuses and making a commitment to taking responsibility for our choices, we can make better decisions that lead to lasting results.\n\nThank you for reading, and we wish you all the best in making positive choices in life",

        "text": "I really need some advice. Should I try to salvage the relationship? Or should I just let it be as it is. I really want to improve myself and I feel improving my relationships/friendships is important. That’s why I chose to post here :) \n\nI’ll put some key points to help anyone who can give me advice on this, a breakdown of the situation. \n\n\n\n- Me and my friend have always been extremely close. We would spend everyday together. We were inseparable.\n\n- We started getting distant when my friends mom felt I was a bad influence. So I could no longer really be at her house anymore. During that time I did clean up my act. And her mom did let me come over again a few months later. So I don’t feel like her mom really played a factor in us seeing each other much anymore. So it was up to her if she wanted to see me or not. Which she didn’t make that much effort in. \n\n- I feel like she didn’t really try making that much of an effort to really even see me anymore. She knew I was willing to go and see her at any time. I just feel hurt because I was ALWAYS willing. I was always willing to reach out. I was always willing to go see her. I don’t feel like that was reciprocated. \n\n\n- the pandemic happened as everyone knows. We then stopped talking as much too. I asked her what’s going on? I told her I missed her basically and I want us to go back to normal. Since we have been friends for so long I didn’t want to lose her. I explained that to her. She said to me basically “It’s hard for me to talk to someone I barely see anymore.” That really hurts looking back. For two reasons. One being the choice of words. Someone? I thought we were best friends? Like sisters… I thought we were supposed to be for life. What about all the plans we made together for the future? And two being the fact that she didn’t even TRY to see me. \n\n- she started getting closer to someone else. And I even found out she was talking bad about me with this other girl. I seen text messages with my own two eyes. And as me and her were getting more distant she was getting closer to this other girl. I forgave her for that and we moved forward…. I still felt replaced though.\n\n- Then it became mostly me always reaching out. Always trying to initiate. I always tried to contact. But again nothing. I felt hurt. So I remember I had texted her once. And she didn’t reply to me until days later. Saying “sorry”. At that point it just became too much for me. It was extremely hurtful. So I didn’t even reply. Not a word. I didn’t know what to say. I felt that I’ve said enough. I addressed the issue with her and she said she cared. But her actions didn’t show that. And what hurt the most is she didn’t try reaching out to me after that either. Nothing. We didn’t speak for almost two years. It’s almost like she forgot about me. She didn’t even care to know why I stopped talking. She didn’t try to reach out. Nothing. It just made me feel like the end of our friendship was completely one sided. Because as soon as I stop reaching out we don’t speak AT ALL. And I mean literally not a word. \n\n- fast forward to now. She texted me on Snapchat. I thought that maybe she finally remembered her friend that she basically threw away. But I was wrong. All it was, was a meme. No context. No words. Nothing. That really reopened old wounds for me. Because damn. I’m not even worth a “how are you?” You don’t think im worth even a hello? A simple hello..? Nothing. I felt like her sending me that meme was almost like her saying she sees me as a joke. I replied to her “ok?” Because again I was hurt. Like seriously???? What was I supposed to say to that? What does that even mean? It just hurt. And she left me on seen and didn’t say anything after that. It’s been two months since that text and I still miss her. I feel hurt. Could I be overthinking that? Could that be her way of reaching out? Or no? Is that her just trolling me and not putting in effort. \n\nTL;DR. Thats my situation. I felt it started becoming one sided. I felt replaced. I felt thrown away. Should I try? What does that even mean? She sent me a meme with no context whatsoever after us not talking for nearly two years. I really wish I could understand what she was trying to say with that. I really do want to reach out. But I don’t want it to be a pattern again of the same thing. I just want to be wanted too. Will I have to be the one to contact her for us to ever even talk? And if that’s the case is it even worth it? I just feel like if she cared she would contact me too. If she actually wanted to be best friends. But she hasn’t. So that just makes me feel like she just doesn’t care. I feel like if in order for us to ever talk again and I have to initiate it, doesn’t that mean that I’m the only one who cares? If I always have to be the one to initiate things doesn’t that mean Im the only one who wants the friendship? I just want to know why didn’t she try for me? Why didn’t she try to see me? Why didn’t she reciprocate the love that I showed for her in the end of our friendship. I just want her to care about me as much as I care about her. I just don’t know how to say that without seeming desperate. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I reach out to her or no? We used to be so close before all of this that’s what hurts. Should I just give up? Or should I try talking to her? And ask her why send me a meme with no context with low effort as if we weren’t best friends????",

But for some reason I don't FEEL like I've made progress if that makes sense.\n\nBasically my main goal is to be happy, but it seems like as time goes on I just start to feel more and more lost and empty. It doesn't matter if I'm improving myself or being self destructive, I feel like my overall mental health won't stop getting worse no matter what I do.\n\nFor example: I get enough sleep, eat good, workout, and I'm still tired. I meditate, read, avoid dopamine stuff, and I still can't focus for shii. Now I'm not trying to be impatient, I get that results can take a while to manifest, but it seems like when it comes to anything mental like my happiness, clarity, motivation, or just will to live in general, it just won't stop getting worse.\n\nPart of me thinks it might be loneliness. I struggle to make deep connections with people. I've never had any close friends that I can really talk to. Because of this lack of an outlet, I feel like I'm a little too introspective. Other than when I'm at school, I'm always so in my head, and I can't really get out. I just think constantly. I struggle to put my thoughts together in a way that actually makes sense, but at the same time I feel like I'm about to make a meaningful realization so I don't want to stop thinking if that makes sense. Idk I just thought maybe that might be the problem.\n\nAnd this whole thing is kind of a negative feedback loop. If I'm sad, it will impare my ability to things. If I can't get clarity and my mind is just a mess of thoughts, I'm not going to be able to figure out what to do moving forward, and will be more likely to relapse on addictions, fall out of healthy habits, etc.\n\nIt's really demotivating to think about. My shiddy mental health, the one thing that I can't figure out how to overcome, is the one thing that's really holding me back. So yeah idk. I guess in the meantime I'll try and not let my mental health dictate my productivity, but long term, idk how to get better, and it kinda makes me question the point of doing any of this in the first place.\n\nIdrk why I wrote this tbh. Maybe if someone has advice to give that'd be great, but it'd be nice to just relate with someone if that happens too",

It's how I started my journey towards self love and self worth:\n\n\\- What do you love?\n\n\\- What are your boundaries?\n\n\\- What are your values?\n\n\\- What won't you do?\n\n\\- What do you want to do more of in life?\n\n\\- What do you want to experience and feel more of in your life?\n\n\\- What do you know about yourself?\n\nWhen you know who you are, it will be easier to know your self-worth and see your self-value.

        "text": "Hello! I am a 16years old boy. I'm shy, fat and don't really have \"friends\".. I thought I'd express my thoughts here. (Excuse my English please)\n\nI was never that hard-working student at school. I always had \"good\" grades, 7/10 seems like a decent grade to me. Maybe some of you think that 7 is a high grade, but it is not. In my country, the teachers are very understanding and \"Inflate\" the students' grades. This year I entered high school, one of the best high school in my town ( i worked very hard last year for this) due to my ambition to get to a good high school. Now it's quite difficult for me, I'm majoring in mathematics and informatics, everything is beyond me except informatics (im one of the best, if not the best, in my class), all of my classmates are very good students with grades of only 10 and 9. I feel strange because they all know everything and I don't. I don't really care about this but sometimes I do. I can't adapt very well and I didn't even in general school, everyone goes out during breaks, talk, laugh, and I simply sit at the desk and look out the window or play on my phone. I tried to break away from my shyness, but I can't integrate into conversations and all my colleagues avoid me... I mean, they didn't say this to me, but I see that they don't like it when I appear and this thing makes me even more shy. Every time I do something wrong and someone draws my attention I feel stupid. That's why I don't answer the lessons at school.\n\nSecondly, I don't like the way I look at all, I'm 1.90m and 105kg (last summer I was 115kg but I managed to lose a little weight) let's say I can solve this with a lot of ambition... I don't know what to do to I can adapt more in society ( I stay at home all day ).\n\nThirdly, I want to cry when I see that many of my old friends and colleagues have girlfriends.. I want a girlfriend too :(.. I can't find anyone suitable (probably because I don't leave the house much) but even if I would find that person, I'm sure he won't like me because I'm the ugliest person I know and I'm not kidding. For a long time I was bullied, my friends laughed at me for different reasons, mostly because I'm fat and ugly.. I honestly don't know how I got the courage to write all this..\n\nIn short, I'm lonely, sad, and unhappy with myself and I want to change something but I don't know how.",

        "text": "Throwaway account. I just wanted a vessel to vent and maybe see if anyone else has gotten through something similar. I just wrote what was on my mind so it may not be very linear. It is very long.\n\nI was never a good person. Sure, I had good intentions, but my executions always went haywire. After uni, I went back to my parents’ place because it was covid during this time and felt safer and my work hours were being cut so I moved in to save rent. I received a lot of edd and saved up to move out to pursue a new career. It was tough to get a job in that industry, and so I made the decision. I was also quite depressed during this time, unsure of what I was doing, wasting time, questioning my life living with parents at the age of 23. I also had no privacy due to shared rooms and I wasn’t in a good place.\n\nTo be honest, this new career path I chose not because I really wanted to, but it was a viable job path and it would make them somewhat proud I have a stable job. Living alone, I was okay. Lonely, but I was doing okay.\n\nLast night I had a car accident that was my fault. \n\nWhile I was living alone, I worked a little bit but quit as the pay wasn’t good, and stayed out of work as I had enough funds to cover rent. I went back and forth in quitting and staying and voiced this with my parents already, and I didn’t want to show that side of uncertainty to them, and knowing it was a side job to make some extra cash and not a full time one, I didn’t think it would hurt to lie to have them think I’m still working, to prevent any worries about me being broke or lazy. I was also applying to a lot of jobs so I thought I could get one and just tell them that new job instead. Like I said, good intentions, terrible execution. I had to let them know of this too and came clean as taxes are coming up. It had to be done and I was going to bring it up, and decided to do it alongside sharing the car accident news.\n\nThere were many occasions where I have disappointed them. One time my dad came in to see my house was a mess. At one point all I wanted to do was sleep. I had no appetite, and could no longer eat as much as I could. I would skip an entire day of eating. I noticed this too cause I was losing weight. This caused me to get super lazy and not clean. I told them I was depressed but I don’t even know if what I was feeling was that. My mom cried over the phone that night too. I promised them I’ll be better and to try to show a more positive side.\n\nAnd now we’re at today. I had so many things to say I couldn’t bear myself to say it over the phone, I sent an email and am now waiting for his call. I am so insanely nervous and shaking uncontrollably. I did not get a lick of sleep last night.\n\nBecause the thing is, this wasn’t even my first accident. This was my second. They were both big crashes too. This one not as much, but they both still ended with my car being totaled. Car prices are ridiculous nowadays, so I know I won’t be getting a new one and I no longer feel like I am capable of driving.\n\nI laid in bed and just sort of retraced my entire life. I’ve disappointed them so much. I’m now 25 and still don’t have a full time job. I was never an outspoken person and I know just my energy, my personality, never attracted anyone and I know it was the same for my parents. The car crash was the final straw. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel physically sick, and feel like I’m losing it.\n\nIf I had a full time job, none of this would be a problem. I could pay for the damages myself so they don’t have to carry the burden. I could finally let my parents rest without constant anxiety of me being broke.\n\nI feel like I’m the worst person and I am. I am fully convinced. Everything I do hurts those around me. It doesn’t matter what intentions. None of that matters. Not anymore. \n\nKnowing my parents, they would probably try to console me. Bring me in to their house again. They are so fucking nice I wish they were assholes so I don’t have to feel so bad. But they’ve done so much for me, and this is the shit I throw back at them. What a despicable bastard I am. An absolute piece of shit. I don’t deserve to live. No one is a more fuckup than me.\n\nWhen I was younger, my parents fought a lot. There was also a point where my sister caused a lot of problems that veered all their attention to her. Nowadays, they’re apologizing to me for not taking well enough care for me and looking out for me during those times. Are you serious? No like why the hell do you think I deserve that? There are others who are in a much worse spot than I am. People who lost their parents. People with abusive parents. Do parents not fight? All of them probably have. I was fine spending the days in my room playing games and watching YouTube, and I think it might have become a comfort thing for me cause I’ve done it for so long. But that is never to blame. I had loving parents who fed me daily and put a roof over my head. Some don’t even get that.\n\nFor once, I want to make them proud. I can’t put them through any more heartache. They’re reaching their 60s now I cannot do this to them anymore. I’m so sick of hurting them. For once I want to carry all the burden and not the other way around. I don’t know how to breathe properly anymore.\n\nI’ve given them so much stress now again I feel like they could just collapse from mental exhaustion at any moment.\n\nIn my dream, I see myself as financially successful, sitting across my parents at the dinner table and having a good time laughing at each other’s jokes and talking about how my work has been. I want to down several cans of beer with my dad over some fried chicken because that’s his favorite food. I want to get shit faced drunk with him and go to the karaoke and sing our hearts out. I want to take them to hawaii and Mexico which they always wanted to visit. I want to give them a massive check in thanks for all the support and love they’ve given me, and stick brand new car keys in there so they can drive good cars. I want to hug my mom and tell her I’ve finally made it. I want to. For once. Tell them that I’m okay and have them really believe it.\n\nBut I have betrayed their trust with my lies, and I will never get to live that dream. And that makes me cry a lot, and I never cry about anything. Ever.\n\nI’m a failure and I’ve accepted it now. I can’t bear to visit them every week anymore. I can’t bear the thought of my mom still making me dinner. I don’t deserve it.",

        "text": "\nGreetings,\nI'll try to keep this brief. Thank you for your time.\n\nI am not happy with myself or life and I need help. \n\nI'm 26 and I work a boring job at a company I hate. If I didn't go to work they wouldn't even notice. I spend most my day in the bathroom looking at memes for maybe 6 hours of the 8 hour work day. \n\nWhen I was 24 I started fixing up a house which I now live in. It's close to the beach, but overall it's very small, so small I couldn't really live here with two people comfortably. (I don't want to live alone forever) I'm not done fixing it up but it's going to take too much money for what I think it's worth so I'm losing interest. \n\nI don't like my job and I don't like where I live. When I was 19 I wanted to be a paramedic but after I got my EMT I realized how low they're paid for how much stress they take on. It didn't seem worth it. Which is why I work where I do. Originally I thought the low stress job was a godsend, now I see how horribly depressing factory life can be. \n\nI spend way too much time in my head. I am constantly dissociated from reality. I live in my mind, and take brief visits to reality to focus on a task which is always accompanied with anxiety.  I don't exactly regret not being an EMT, but I regret listening to my anxiety. I feel as I've fallen through the cracks in self development. I do not feel 26. I feel 21 + 5 years. I have okay finances but I'm still worried about not making enough money. It's all I cared about growing up and I still cared about it deeply. \n\nMajor problems I keep ruminating:\n1. I have no identity. Ever since high school (homeschooled) I just did what was easy and financially sound. I valued finances as I saw it was the key to respect and options with women. I convinced myself financial stability is number one trait in attracting a good woman. (Relationship fantasies are my only real motivator) My interests are shaped around affordability. My car and house are essentially paid off which is the only reason I like them. \n\n2. I am horrible at making decisions for myself. \nSo many people can just say \"I want to.\" And this is a good enough reason. I made most of my decisions out of what I thought was a good idea. It is extraordinarily hard for me to make a decision at this point in my life. I Always distrusted a decision made from emotion. Now all of my decisions seem to be based away from reason cuz I'm not happy.\n\n3. Can I really change?\n\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\"\n\nCan I be normal? I've been dissociated in my head since I was 13, the anxiety, how could I change years of conditioning? Where I'm at now is a reflection of my best thinking for the past 13 years. How do I know what I can change? \n\n\"Courage is knowing it might hurt, and doing it anyway. Stupidity is the same. And that's why life is hard\".\n\nAt this point I'm considering joining the military. Getting good physical shape. Sell my house. Leave my shitty company. Start over entirely. I can get educated for free+ travel. Getting away from where I'm at now sounds like it really open my view on life.\n\n It's what I would have done at 19 knowing what I know now and not listening to my anxiety, but of course I have responsibilities... \n\nI can't enjoy my life, which I really should be grateful for. I'm incapable of making my own decisions at this point. I feel as if I'm living way below my means due to my anxiety. I've had a couple great relationship experiences that I feel I'll never get again. I don't really like myself. Unless I start living for ME I'm scared I'll be alone forever.  I don't know who I am, I'm too easily influenced by  women and money. I have no backbone. \n I'll be turning 27 in 4 months. I don't know where to start.",

However, it felt good for a little after but now after a few days it feels as if it didn't happen. Or I tell myself, \"you're worth it, you're an amazing guy\" etc.\n\nI keep trying to remind myself of these and I know these qualities but how do I make these stick with me and legitimately \"feel\" those attributes. Maybe I don't trust it/believe myself as much?\n\nHopefully this made sense, thoughts?",

Other than school I had nothing going on in my life. I would spend most of my time on reddit (as you can see from my karma lol) or play games, watch shows etc. You get the point. I was being useless.\n\nFor the past 6 months, I've been on self-improvement and honestly the results are astonishing. My body is in better shape than ever before, I picked up the skill of writing and got published in a paid magazine, got the highest grades multiple times this year in law school whereas before I was always average and yet when I go for a walk or sometimes in the gym I just think of how my mental health is still fucked.\n\nI guess in a way it better to know it early on as I'm in my 20s than live like a degen until 30s and then discover all this, aka midlife crisis, but still. It is weird.\n\nBack when all I did was game and not care about my looks, or picking up a skill, on the average day to day I would be in such a better mood. It is not that I'm depressed now I'm just ''serious'' now always. Idk how to describe it but people in my class, my doctor and even my brother have told me how I  always look mad now in default mode lol.\n\nOn a last note, my social skills in general have mostly sucked in my life and I've never really had any friends. While a strong community is definitely a thing we should all aspire to have, I guess me living for 23 years on this planet like a hermit just made me accept it. But like I said, back in my gaming days I didn't have any friends either, still, I was a happy kid.",

When others give him praise, I see right trough him and can't stand that shit. Some persuasiveness is ok, but i had couple bad years and I used persuasiveness to appear \"confident\" or whatever to make myself safe from everyone. Before that, I was getting lighthearted comments like \"why are you not a boss of some company\" or people think that I am some kind of go getter. Which I am really not. That's just how I learned to talk. Recently it was getting worse, some people think I am a dickhead and that I think I am better than everyone else, which I don't think that. I don't know how to act different, I don't even notice it. I just see how some personalities react to me, some get anxious or submissive, others get angry or defensive, others who have similar vibe, we just joke around. I don't know if it is something I can change.\n\nI think I have connected persuasiveness to confidence and I am using it to get people to hear me out. But I don't know, it sometimes comes out so fake and that I am trying to be something I am not, especially if I am not feeling myself that day. I am trying to control my anxiety with mindfulness and deep breathing, because the more anxious I feel, the more persuasive I become. But even if I am not anxious it is there.",

I can't wear anything besides sweat pants and hoodies outside my home. I just wish I could throw my whole body away and be someone else. I don't think I'll ever be happy until I lose weight or learn to accept my body. What do I do?",

        "text": " \n\nPlease lecture or guide me !!\n\nI  have always been curious about things in general, thanks to my father  buying me a computer at an early age; I always wanted to do something  related to electricity, computer etc. I was always interested in science  projects in middle school. In the middle of the journey, I Changed  schools to one which focusses on brute learning (learn it by heart &amp;  write exams repeat, oh I meant Mugg that up). After joining the new  school, I Started with hacking, not really some cool shit, just social  engineering. I still remember the technique of kicking the user from its  network and forcing it to connect with my fake one asking to enter a  password for re-verification. Still, I was never successful with this  attack because it's a third-world country; dude, no one had a wifi  connection at that time; I was never sad that I could not do it; just  the process of doing it was fun. In 8th or 7th, I was introduced to  Arduino and lego robotics and had so much fun. And in the background of  my academic story, I learned &amp; mugged(I loved to learn, the mugging  shit never sat with me ) my academic books in school but was never able  to get good grades in the final exam. I knew the concepts but could  never get good marks. I should have studied harder.\n\nThis  happened till now (academic failures continue till graduating high  school); it's 9th grade now, and I got interested in android development  but was not specifically able to do it or learn it ( my stupid laptop  had just 4 GB ram and a Celeron processor 🥲 its 2019 or 2018) so  shifted my focus towards things which I can do build basic web pages 😂  it was definitely funnnn. As I reached 10th, I started doing a little  bit of freelance I Just made 30$ in 9 months 💀. Bootstrap 3 was  shittttttttttttttttttt to learn; I never understood that despite putting  many months into it. Creative coding was funn creating art out of  randomness; one of my successful/unsuccessful(I stopped it in the  middle) projects was that I tried to make a soft body physics engine. If  I remember correctly, the First time I read about gas laws (It was not  in my syllabus) to code the engine, it was something about balancing the  forces inside and outside the body. Sadly never completed it. During  this time, tutorial hell also became a problem for me. I did not know  about this condition and worked myself to burnout ( not because I was  doing so many projects but because I was not completing them). This  burnout and fucking covid have fucked me up for 2 years. Now comes the  lockdown part of my high school years; you know I never did a thing; I  just studied sacrificed programming ( because I did the opposite till  10th took studies seriously this time) and still got no result in the  final high school exam (plus was introduced to anime such a wonderful  thing and web series like Dark, Mr Robot and GOT was amazing was lucky  to see all this). For context, I had wanted to study abroad since 9th (  when I heard that one of the students in my school got into a US  university despite bad grades and got a scholarship to study, I was so  excited, but I was a naive kid) not because I want to feel or live the  American dream but to leave competition so much competition. In the last  months of high school, I chickened out at the end of applying to uni's  because my percentage was not good and remember, I did not do anything  for 2 years of high school. Still applied to some schools and got  admitted but no money. It's clear I am fucked in life currently, at  least.\n\nRight  now, I again do nothing, Just learning calculus ( not a bad topic,  really interesting, but I never get marks, this means I am just stupid )  to give exams to get into college. I feel I am stuck I will be joining a  college where I will be wearing a uniform to go to college, just like  my high school (aah, I have achieved a remarkable feat). I cannot find  the person who was crazy about doing or exploring things right now; I  cannot see anything in the future; it's definitely dark and cruel,  that's for sure. Job prospects after college are joining a call center  or making sales. I guess that's what I heard. I recently asked my father  if I could do a PHD well, that would be good, but I am still naive; I  guess a lower middle-class person cannot do a PHD it will be a  economical suicide. This is a rant about life.\n\nI  know a path forward which will help me achieve my dream and it's hard  but that doesn't matter but now the problem is its painfull mentally  really painfull mann sacrified my high-school life  I did not have much  fun and knowing that it will repeat it now for 4 college years  its  giving me anxiety now.\n\n////Thanks if you read it till here.",

        "text": "So as the title suggests I'm looking for advice on how to navigate a situation I find myself in. I know Therapy would be far more effective in helping solve this issue, but that isn't an option for me now so I'm extending the question to all of you. \n\nSo there is alot I hate about myself. Pretty much everything. I have struggles with Gender Identity, I feel guilt every time I eat meat, I feel guilt buying plastic things, I feel bad hurting peoples feelings even if they are shitty people, because of my Gender Identity issues, I find myself feeling more alive and happy when I Identify as a Woman and dress femenine as a Woman.\nI'm not intimidating, I'm not afraid to stand up for myself but I am always so nice about it on instinct. I'm nice to everyone on instinct and try to mother everyone I'm close to. \n\nI know some of these traits aren't seen as bad, but I don't want them. I want to be a tough, macho, serious Man like you see on TV or like you meet in real life. I know there is alot about TV characters that is unreal, but I want to emulate the parts I can. Every person I look up to and want to emulate though is the polar opposite of me. They are brutish, intimidating, strong,  powerful, charismatic, masculine, decisive, and most of all not Trans or struggling with their Gender. \n\nRecently i have been trying to work myself up to cutting out the Trans side of me, ridding myself of all Female/Trans oriented things I own, Cutting my hair from long to short and just flipping as much of myself as I can to this archetype I want to fill.\n\nHere is the issue though. All the things I would have to change are the only things I like about myself. My hair, presenting femenine, always being as kind as is possible. These things make me feel good, but my Brother needs an older brother, my friends need their bro-friend, and I love the idea of being this rugged masculine strong-man. \nHow do I work myself up to cutting my hair and donating all of my clothes? How do I make meaningful and lasting changes to my personality so that I can be mean for the right reasons or be just be all around manly?  Is it wrong for me to want to be less nice to people, not that I just want to be mean to everyone, just want to roughen myself up so I'm not as easy and meek as I am now. \nThanks for any advice, I'm willing to elaborate more where necessary.",

        "text": "[context] \n\nI, (f19) have a really shitty past for many reasons. Abusive upbringing, neglect, drug abuse, etc. Around 14-17 years old I was a really shitty person. I went to high school but barely graduated. It was at that time when I struggled with substance abuse the most. I was always angry at the world and didn’t care much about the people around me or myself. That being said, I hurt a lot of people I really care about, I took my anger out on others. If I felt the slightest bit hurt, I’d go out of my way to hurt them back. 2021/2022 rolled around and kicked my ass, probs some of the most difficult years in my life so far. I knew I’d messed up with people in the past but was mostly just in a pity party about it, not really reflecting on my past or doing much to change. After a near death experience early 2022 and obviously surviving it, I looked back into my past mistakes which I honestly just tried to forget. I’ve managed to sober up, started to go to therapy, reconnected and apologized to people I’ve hurt before, some have forgiven me and we’re friends to this day, others stated they appreciated the apology but didn’t want to be friends again. Understandable. But there’s one person who I reconnected with that has said they’ve forgiven me, but brings up my past mistakes and seems to use them against me to sort of invalidate any of my concerns. I probably deserve it, I was a really shitty person with him. But at this point, I know I messed up, I’ve apologized numerous times and have done what I can to show I’ve grown way past the person I once was. \n\nMy question to those who may have similar stories is: \n\nIs there any point in trying to keep proving yourself? What else can you do? I feel like I’m missing something or I just start to tell myself I deserve it but other times I don’t think I do. In therapy I was told I shouldn’t blame myself too much since I’ve been through enough and what matters is that I’ve put in the effort to change, but is that really true? I don’t want to lose him ever, I love him. I also know I can’t live the rest of my life beating myself up over the past when I know I wouldn’t behave or act the same way now… is this something I just need to live with now? Do my concerns not really mean shit because of my mistakes? I don’t really understand how valid my feelings are, I don’t really talk to people and have other issues which effect the way I think and have been told it’s very different than most peoples way of thinking. \n\nAny advice is appreciated",

        "text": "I've been struggling with this problem for the past few years where people have been treating me very poorly because of how I'm perceived. I used to be just a normal guy, but somewhere along the way something changed and now people talk down to me, stop listening when I speak, don't see any value in me, don't see me as another human being, avoid me, and are uncomfortable around me. I feel like I'm being excluded from society because of how I am. It's made it pretty much impossible to make new friends or a girlfriend. I haven't made a friend in years, I only have one currently, and girls want NOTHING to do with me, they avoid me hardcore. The only friend I have is one that knew me when I was \"normal\" so he knows I'm still the same guy inside.\n\nIf I can guess why people treat me this way, it's because of how I am perceived. I'm perceived as a mentally weird guy. Like there's something just \"off\" about me. Sort of like if you saw a crazy, drugged-out homeless guy yelling in the street at nobody, you'd want to stay the fuck away from him. If he came up to you you'd probably ignore him or tell him to go away. I feel like people can sense that sort of energy on me and they treat me like a crazy homeless guy, although maybe not to that extreme. I also probably give off loser vibes as well, even though I personally don't think I am a loser or feel like a loser.\n\nThe thing is, I don't feel that weird inside and I don't do weird things in my life. I don't do drugs, I don't smoke, and I don't drink. I have a pretty good paying, stable, normal job. I have a few normal hobbies. I have things I'm passionate about. I feel like I'm a pretty good person morally. I exercise. I pay my bills and do all the things I'm supposed to be doing and that other people are doing, yet I get treated this way.\n\nA lot of the time, I don't want to leave my house because I don't want to get treated badly. I'm just so tired of being socially deprived and not being able to live my life normally. I just want to be able to have normal interactions with people. Like just see my neighbor outside one day and ask him how his jobs going and he asks me about my hobbies, and we just talk for a few minutes, whatever, just normal interactions. But for now, it's peeking through my blinds and checking to see if anybody's outside before I leave so I don't have to deal with the feeling of being mistreated.\n\nHow can I fix this? I feel like I've tried everything. Just \"thinking\" normal. Trying to do more \"normal\" things. Smiling more. Working on my social skills. Trying to brush it off when things go bad. Putting on a confident attitude. I'm pretty sure I know in my mind how to just be a normal guy, but in practice it doesn't come across correctly. Would love some advice or thoughts, feeling really stuck. Thank you.",

        "text": " I 23M have had bad luck at dating. I’m average height, extremely muscular and toned, and a generally a hard worker. I have Asperger’s and was diagnosed at 11. Since that diagnosis, I feel like I had a big mark on my back that I can’t get off. My family members and close friends (that don’t know my diagnosis) think I’m normal so I guess the amount of Asperger’s I do have isn’t noticeable, and the family members that do know my diagnosis think the doctors misdiagnosed me. My social skills were bad as a kid, but progressed a lot better to today as an adult. I’m really smart and in four months, I’m starting a new job that I’ll be making $100-$120k a year. People that I know at my work, gym, and in my life say that I would be a great catch for a good woman, but I’m now starting to believe they might be lying to me. I haven’t had much luck in relationships my entire life and I’m starting to worry that it won’t get better. Not much luck on dating apps, don’t have any single women my age in my social circle, and I’m afraid of trying cold approach. My fear is that when I’m in my 30s I’ll end up with a either fat or obese woman with step kids or a woman that had all her sexual fun in her 20s and is now a single mom with a few kids that’s only with me for financial support and doesn’t truly love me and don’t want to have sex with me. I want to be someone that’s on the same physical level as me, loves to go to the gym or do CrossFit like me and other fun things. I don’t have high expectations for who I want in a partner, but I feel like with my social awkwardness and my social situation having little to no friends at the moment, I’m screwed. Is there hope for someone like me to find love or should I just give up on love all together?",

Due to severely bad mental health, I decided to not give three exams which I'd be giving in July of this year\n\nI'm currently doing graphic designing and I have 3 projects pending.\n\nI also have an art instagram and a novel I'm working on and I'm also learning japanese.\n\nAll these projects takes hours to finish but I can't seem to figure things out.\n\nMy daily schedule has only 2hrs booked for graphic designing class for 6 days a week. I'm free for almost all day.\n\nMy sleep schedule is something I've been trying to fix for about 6yrs now and because of that my confidence and motivation are both extremely low right now. If I don't wake up on time, I feel like entire day is ruined.\n\nI'd definitely love a daily schedule to stick to. I work best when I bind myself to specific hours.\n\nI'd love some suggestions on schedule and how to fix sleep schedule. I used to take sleeping pills which worked phenomenally for as long as I took them but this year I stopped taking them and my sleep schedule went to shit again.",
