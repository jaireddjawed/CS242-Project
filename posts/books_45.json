For the record I am 14 and probably too young for this but I have also enjoyed Camus and Nietzche was suggested to me as the next logical step.

The book is built from actual letters between a New York City writer and the staff of a used book store in England. Over decades, they become emotionally attached as a friendship develops and the reader gets to watch it happen. Writers and book lovers can relate to the main character. Literature nerds can geek out to the references to obscure authors and literary history, which are short and not at all tedious. There is also a later film with Anthony Hopkins and Judy Dench. I have read that this book was popular and well known, but I had not heard of it. There is not much action or drama, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.",

        "text": "I have just finished reading this magnificent work of literature, and I would venture to say that this novel has exquisitely canvassed a sophisticated account of the accumulation of resentment and malice and their often sad but reasonable justifications. It has excited in me the most affectionate sympathies, for both The Monster and Frankenstein. For the monster as he had an intrinsically good disposition and endearing intentions and was only faced with detestation and rejection from everyone. And for Viktor as he had to endure the consequences of his careless and unbridled enthusiasm for science. \n\nThis was my most favourite paragraph, as the monster was lamenting the death of his creator and his lonely condition.\n\n\" when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone. \"",

I cried, I laughed, I cried again. I felt happy &amp; sad &amp; angry (not towards them but towards how others treated them &amp; wildlife). Their love for each other was truly out of this world. \n\nThis book is written by the woman who knew &amp; loved him the most. She did an amazing job writing this. It came out in 2007, a year after he passed. I promise you, once you start this book, you won’t be able to put it down. You’ll read all of the conversations in his voice. \n\nCrikey! Crocs rule!",

        "text": "So this is maybe weird, but I've had this dilemma for a while: I have a bunch of non-fiction books that I felt were really bad and potentially harmful. I want to get rid of them because obviously I'm not going to continue reading them ever. Throwing them away seems wasteful, but if I donate them to some shop for instance, I feel like I'm spreading these bad ideas. Some part of me also wonders whether it is arrogant to assume what other people shouldn't read.\n\nWhat do you do in such situations and why?",

        "text": "I tried to talk to my wife about the story last night but my description to her didn't do it justice. You have to have read the story to feel the true depths of emotion that comes from Charlie's story. God where do I start? I apologize for the incoming word vomit as I try to piece my thoughts into coherent speech. I feel that Keyes did an excellent job turning Charlie into a tragic figure. I saw  what was going to happen miles away, shit they even mention it on the back of the book but I couldn't look away. I read the entire book yesterday. I've never read a 300 page book in a day but I had to feel out the gritty details, I felt compelled. The relationships around Charlie left me feeling a pit in my stomach. The betrayal by his coworkers, only to regain their love after losing his intelligence, his objectification by the researchers, and the struggle with his family. Keyes did a hell of a job tackling the issue of a shitty childhood. Each of them had their own development despite being minor characters in the story. Of course his mom develops dementia, of course his loving father doesn't recognize him and, the most clever of all, of course his tormented sister develops into a loving, compassionate adult. No relationship in the story is as important as Alice though. God does their relationship make me hurt. I never cry. I didn't cry at my own wedding, but goddamn do I feel awful thinking about the two of them. At no point in the story does she betray Charlie, speak a lie or abandon him. Even when they fight, she is justified and rekindles what they have soon enough. When he starts to fall down and sabotages their relationship as tear fell into my book. I just wanted them to work out so badly. But you know what? He got to experience love. True love. That he never would have experienced had he not gone under the knife. Although fleeting, he was able to feel the joy of lust with Fay and the deep, emotional connection with Alice. Near the end of the story when he returns to her classroom, seemingly unaware of his history or that he wasn't in the class anymore and calls her \"Miss Kinnian\" my heart just broke. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for my stream of consciousness. I have a lot more to say I just cant express it well enough. This book touches so deeply on what makes us human, love, intelligence, respect, etc. that I just can't process it all right now. I couldn't sleep last night. This morning I woke up and mind is still racing.",

        "text": "John Rain. A half Japanese, half American Vietnam veteran turned freelance assassin. Specialises in making his kills look natural. Unstoppable force of nature. \n\nHave you heard of him? If you haven’t, you should. And you should start at the very beginning. \n\nBarry Eisler has created an alternate universe much like our own, except that within, there exists a badass group of various killers. This killing collective consists of a number of various personalities. Our aforementioned hafu Rain-san, a deaf NSA contractor, a Lahu trafficked child turned cop/rapist hunter, and so on and so forth. \n\nThese characters are all exceptionally well written, and their individual stories are great, but what Eisler does so well is weave them together. \n\nIt’s a bit like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but in badass, realistic, killing book form. You have an origin story for each character, mainly focussing only on them, then later stories, which sometimes spins in other characters, and, occasionally, they all get thrown in together for maximum chaos, paranoia and bad-guy murdering. \n\nIf it sounds apppealing, I implore you to start at the very beginning, with “A Clean Kill in Tokyo”. This introduces you the most important and pivotal character in John Rain. He’s our protagonist, and the only character to narrate in the first-person. From this point, you should read through everything in publication order. \n\nAlong the way, you’ll be introduced to more and more characters, all of whom have their own backstories and challenges. \n\nBy the time you get to the first book not centred around Rain, you won’t want to let him go. You’ll want to skip, and push on with Rain’s story. Don’t. The payoff here is worth it. When all of them get together and unleash their fury, it’s like the coming of the apocalypse. \n\nSo, if you fancy reading thrillers set in all corners of the globe, from Japan, to the States, to Thailand and the Netherlands and Hong Kong, all of which link together to make epic novels of unabridled insanity, pick up that first novel and enter Rain’s world. And let me know if you like em!",
