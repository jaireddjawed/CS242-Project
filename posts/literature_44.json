        "author": "LAL4Lyfe",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/7xrlfl/magic_in_the_monkeys_paw/",
        "text": "Some background: I'm a 7th year 8th grade language arts teacher in the US. \n\nOne of the stories we read recently was \"The Monkey's Paw\" by WW Jacobs. I'd taught it before, but never really thought much about it. As I read it more, I began to realize: There's no magic at all; it's all in their heads. I wanted to discuss with others because I spoke to my principal (a former English teacher) about it and she was absolutely convinced it was magic. The other 8th grade LAL teacher is also convinced there's no magic. I was also surprised when I looked at the Wikipedia article for the story, and it describes it as, \"a supernatural short story,\" but doesn't really go any deeper.\n\nMr. White is a confusing character for me because he's shown to be realistic, yet also one who's led by chance in inappropriate situations. For example, in the first paragraph, the narrator mentions Mr. White's affinity for leaving the game of chess up to chance, rather than skill. This isn't directly related to the topic at hand, but something I noticed.\n\nMy first real piece of evidence for the lack of magic is when Mr. White makes his first wish. The text states: “It moved,” he cried, with a look of horror at the object as it lay on the floor. “As I wished, it\ntwisted in my hand like a snake.”\n\nBefore this, it sounds like he and Sergeant-Major Morris had a long night of drinking whiskey, so I'm already not totally bought into his experience that the monkey's paw twisted in his hand like a snake. My other thought is this: If the author wanted to make it an absolute fact, would the narrator not have said it instead? By revealing this information in the dialogue of Mr. White, a character who has been drinking all night, the validity of his character's experience is put into question.\n\nThroughout the text, Mr. White's son questions how honest Sergeant-Major Morris's character is as he tells tales of his adventures. Mr. and Mrs. White both seem gullible in comparison.\n\nAs Mr. White and his son, Herbert, smoke beside a fire that evening, the text states: \"Outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man jumped nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs.\" This is important for later.\n\nThe next day, as we know, we learn that Herbert had gotten eaten by machinery in the factory we could assume he worked at. Just doing some quick research about labor laws in the UK, it seems that factory deaths were quite common. Although it would have to be a great coincidence that the event happens the day after Mr. White wishes for 200 pounds, it wouldn't be too unlikely that Herbert meets his fate this way. Thus, it's more of a coincidence that the payment was also 200 pounds than it is a coincidence that Herbert was killed in the factory. \n\nMy final discussion point is the fact that after Mr. White wishes for his son to return, none of the characters, nor the readers, ever have confirmation that someone is knocking on the door. Earlier in this response, I quoted a part of the text that states the door on the second floor was knocking in the wind. In this scene, the text states, \"At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he stopped to light another; and at the same moment a knock sounded on the front door. It was so quiet that it could only be heard downstairs, as\nif the one knocking wanted to keep their coming a secret.\" Given the knocking of the door on the second floor as described earlier in the text, there's no reason why the same thing can't be happening here. In this scene, the door continues to \"knock,\" but no one ever sees anyone behind the door.\n\nIn fact, upon reviewing the text, the narrator never explicitly says that the knocking is coming from the door at all, only that the sound of the knocking is traveling throughout the house:\n\n\"A third knock sounded through the house.\"\n\"A loud knock echoed through the house.\"\n\"There was another knock, and another.\"\n\"The knocks came very quickly now echoing through the house\"\n\nThis leads me to believe in two possibilities: (1) the door really is knocking, but 'tis the wind that's the culprit, or (2) mice, as supported by the following: \"A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall.\" \n\nThere is yet another event here that I have to attribute to coincidence--the knocking stops when Mr. White makes his final wish. Even this is up to speculation because we don't have 100% certainty that he wishes for his son to go away because the author only writes, \"...at the same moment he found\nthe monkeys’s paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.\" He could have wished for the knocking to stop. If mice were causing the knocking, it's possible that the commotion caused by Mr. and Mrs. White were enough to still their travels. \n\nThoughts? Rebuttals? \n",

        "text": "I recently read \"No Country For Old Men\" by Cormac McCarthy. After talking about the book with my friend I kept getting Anton Chigurh's name wrong and kept calling him \"Chernobog\". After I looked up the name I remembered that it was a Slavic deity. I started making connections between the two and eventually I did some research.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide any creditable sources on the information of Chernobog. I can only use what I've seen on mythology websites and Wikipedia.\n\nChernobog is a Slavic deity, a black god who brings destruction and misfortune. The first connection that can be made to Chigurh is his name. Chigurh and Chernobog are very different, however they both start with \"Ch\" and this was enough to make me mix the names up initially. This is a weak point but it'll come up later. Also, Anton Chigurh, to me and through the research I've done, sounds European at the very least, however I believe it to be more Slavic in origin. Another connection is how they are portrayed: both are, well, evil. They bring destruction and death and misfortune. Sheriff Bell describes a \"true and living prophet of destruction\", which we can assume is Chigurh. Chirgurh can also be seen as a bringer of misfortune. He justifies his killings as the workings of fate, so others' misfortune. Chigurh is the embodiment of evil just like Chernobog. However, we also must look at the context of both characters. Who views them as evil? Like much of ancient mythology, Chernobog and his fellow Slavic deities were recorded by Christians. The Christian historians of the time are not seen as the most trustworthy, as they seem to push their ideologies onto the myths they were recording. In the same way, Chigurh is seen as evil by southern, Texan people, many of who are openly Christian. \"You're just a blasphemer,\" he is told by Carla Jean. So, obviously, they both are seen as evil in terms of the Christian faith. One definite thing can be said about Chernobog: he existed in Slavic mythology. He was real and he affected the culture to some degree, much like Chigurh who directly affects the story.\n\nNow, after very little research I came across something interesting. When I first thought that the small similarity between Chernobog's and Chigurh's names was just a coincidence, I found the \"good counterpart\" to Chernobog: Belobog. It's very interesting how this god who relates to Chigurh shares a similar name to Sheriff Bell, who is Chigurh's \"good counterpart\". Belobog is the white god of Slavic mythology, the god of the light and the Sun. This is what Bell is too in his book: the embodiment of what is good. The interesting thing about Belobog is that he may not have even existed. There are actually no reliable historical sources that mention him at all. He seems to be made up. He's just there to counter the evil Chernobog. This is a big connection to Bell. He doesn't really do anything. He's just there as something to compare Chigurh to. Much like the Sun that Belobog represents, Bell is destined to look upon the world and watch as the shadows engulf it.\n\nAlthough, this can be taken in a not so pessimistic way. The shadows that engulf the world are natural, not some evil plot to make the world dark. The world has been bathed in sunlight and hidden in shadows since before humans existed, both in the theistic and scientific sense. The world will keep spinning and the darkness and light, the evil and the good, will persist the same way they always have.\n\nWhat do you think in regards to the connection of Chigurh and Bell to the gods Chernobog and Belobog? I wish I could have actual hard evidence of the gods' personalities and worship in ancient Slavic culture. If you have any additional information regarding the gods or the characters please comment. I would love to discuss.\n\nI left out connections to the character Czernobog from 'American Gods' because I'm not sure if the portrayal fits the Slavic canon, however I think even more connections can be made if the character turns out to be accurate.",

Other times he portrays exquisitely our interaction with nature. His words are very dense with imagery and insight. Every time I read his poems I feel amazed of how his well-built images could fit in his strong lyrical style.",
