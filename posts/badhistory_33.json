        "text": "It turns out Li'l Dylann wrote a manifesto, and he's a history buff. The full text can be found [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/20/dylann-roof-manifesto-charleston-shooting_n_7627788.html). I am starting this thread primarily to be a place for an open discussion about this document and what it tells us about Dylann's bad understanding of bad history.\n\nSome initial observations:\n\n* Dylann writes: \n\n&gt;Modern history classes instill a subconscious White superiority complex in Whites and an inferiority complex in blacks. This White superiority complex that comes from learning of how we dominated other peoples is also part of the problem I have just mentioned. But of course I dont deny that we are in fact superior. \n\nHere he seems to be saying that a history of \"white\" \"dominance\" is an objective truth. He doesn't seem to consider the possibility that the history books might be biased in favor of Western civilization or white people, and that this might account for the \"subconscious\" messages he believes can be found. He calls the resultant white \"superiority complex\" a \"problem\" because it promotes complacency.\n\n* Dylann continues:\n\n&gt;I wish with a passion that niggers were treated terribly throughout history by Whites, that every White person had an ancestor who owned slaves, that segregation was an evil an oppressive institution, and so on. Because if it was all it true, it would make it so much easier for me to accept our current situation. But it isnt true. None of it is. We are told to accept what is happening to us because of ancestors wrong doing, but it is all based on historical lies, exaggerations and myths.\n\nIn other words, the current (perceived) oppression of whites by blacks is unjustified because it has no historical foundation. Black people were not oppressed in the past, and so we white people do not deserve payback today. As an example, he writes, \"only a fourth to a third of people in the South owned even one slave.\" He also claims to have read \"hundreds of slave narratives from my state,\" (which, if true, can only mean that he delved into the WPA Narratives) and has found many cases of slaves who loved their masters and plantations where whipping didn't occur.\n\nDylann isn't wrong about his statistic, and he isn't lying about what he found in the WPA slave narratives. (I suspect, though, that instead of actually sitting down with these volumes, he read the cherry-picked selections on his white power websites.)\n\nHe is right that on the eve of the Civil War, about 25% of white households in the South included at least one slave. Dylann seems to be saying that most white people today do not deserve to be killed and raped by black people (which he interprets as revenge for historical wrongs) because their ancestors' hands were clean. However, many of these poor landless tenant farmers in 1861 took up arms to defend the Confederacy anyhow. They did so because they hoped that they could one day become slaveowners themselves. They also defended slavery by being patrollers, by voting for slaveowners, by renting and marketing slaves, by purchasing slave-produced commodities, and by parroting white supremacist doctrine. \n\nNow up in the Appalachians, where slavery was never especially profitable, there were quite a few poor whites who opposed the Confederacy and the slave system. Important examples are West Virginia and eastern Tennessee. Most of these people were nevertheless white supremacists, and were happy that they didn't live near black folk, either slave or free. The point is that statistics about slave ownership need to be contextualized. \n\nDylann is also right that that many plantation owners and managers used violence against slaves sparingly, if at all. There was a neverending debate within the Old South about how to manage the workforce. What works better, the carrot or the stick? There were fans of both methods. No one took any surveys. Modern historiography, however, favors the opinion that violence was endemic within the slave society, and an absolutely crucial and fundamental aspect of it. This really isn't a controversial topic. If your master chose not to use the whip, there was always the threat, unspoken or not, that he would sell you to one of the vast majority who had no such compunctions.\n\nDylann writes about slave interviews: \"Almost all of them were positive. One sticks out in my mind where an old ex-slave recounted how the day his mistress died was one of the saddest days of his life.\" Here we need to go into some background about how these interviews were produced. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration sent hundreds of field agents around the country to interview former slaves for the sole purpose of recording their memories for the sake of historical knowledge. Few of them had any background in doing interviews, most of them were white, and many of them were Southerners. So you would literally get exchanges like, \"Your mistress was good to you, wasn't she?\" \"Yes ma'am.\" \"You don't remember a lot of whippings on the plantation, do you?\" \"No ma'am.\" When a strange white woman appears on your porch in rural Jim Crow Alabama, you are going to be cagey about how you answer her questions. Historians have recognized for a long time that these interviews are problematic, and they have been duly scrutinized. There are over 2000 WPA interviews, and there are deep qualitative differences among them. If Dylann had succeeded in getting his drug-addled mind through 9th grade, he might have learned this.\n\nAnother point: there are many accounts of slaves crying at the funerals of their masters. Partly this was to keep up appearances, and was not a manifestation of true emotion. Another reason for tears was that often, the death of a master meant the reading of his will, and the separation of enslaved families among the heirs and creditors.\n\n* Dylann knows all about Jim Crow:\n\n&gt;Segregation did not exist to hold back negroes. It existed to protect us from them. And I mean that in multiple ways. Not only did it protect us from having to interact with them, and from being physically harmed by them, but it protected us from being brought down to their level. \n\nIt's interesting how old school Dylann's racism is. This is the classic defense of segregation which you could hear from Bull Connor and his ilk back in the day. I find it striking that this stuff is still in circulation, although maybe some of you who are more in touch with the modern white power movement won't be so surprised. The truth is that segregation, which emerged gradually in the decades following the Civil War, was employed to maintain white power throughout the South. There is no question that it was driven in part by fear of black barbarism, but the real goal was to perpetuate disempowerment, politically, socially, and economically.\n\n* Dylann on white flight:\n\n&gt;The pathetic part is that these White people dont even admit to themselves why they are moving. They tell themselves it is for better schools or simply to live in a nicer neighborhood. But it is honestly just a way to escape niggers and other minorities. \n\nHere Dylann might have a point about how whites rationalize suburbanization, even in South Carolina. The historical fact, however, is that the number-one reason why whites left the cities from the 1960s-80s was so that they could get away from black people. The triggers were school desegregation, the growth of the welfare state, \"forced busing,\" and rising black militancy. During the famous showdown over busing in Boston, picketers carried signs saying, \"We don't want any niggers in our school\" and \"Monkeys get out of our neighborhood.\" So not all white people have been coy about their reasoning.\n\n* Dylann returns to his observations of the history classroom:\n\n&gt;In a modern history class it is always emphasized that, when talking about “bad” things Whites have done in history, they were White. But when we lern [sic] about the numerous, almost countless wonderful things Whites have done, it is never pointed out that these people were White. Yet when we learn about anything important done by a black person in history, it is always pointed out repeatedly that they were black. For example when we learn about how George Washington carver was the first nigger smart enough to open a peanut. \n\nWait, didn't you just say that you were subliminally turned into a white-power activist by the content of your history textbooks? This makes it sound like they're all written by bleeding-heart liberals. You might want to sort this out before, you know, you use these beliefs as foundation for some kind of radical action.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver, by the way, was an agricultural scientist. His main interest was to encourage nitrogen-fixing crops (especially peanuts and sweet potatoes) as a way to repair soils from the damage done by cotton in the Lower South. He founded a research lab and his work generated a buzz in Washington. At the behest of his white colleagues, he testified before Congress in 1921 to (successfully) support a tariff on peanuts. The fact that a black man was testifying before Congress as an expert was controversial national news and made him famous. His scientific work was instrumental in helping the South recover from the boll weevil infestation. \n\nDylann is not the first racist to make fun of Carver, which admittedly isn't that hard to do since peanuts are a humorous topic. People also liked to make fun of Jimmy Carter for being a peanut farmer, even though he was also a nuclear engineer. However, there's no question that in the history of Southern agriculture, Carver is an important figure.\n\n* Dylann loved to visit historical sites in South Carolina, and included photos of himself at these sites with his manifesto. I am having trouble figuring out from news reports exactly what those sites were. The linked article says they were \"a slave plantation, Sullivan Island, South Carolina, and the Museum and Library of Confederate History.\" This is cumbersome phrasing. The *New York Times* article on Dylann has now been revised and has dropped its own list of these sites. I haven't been to any of these places. I have my popcorn ready for the embarrassed, defensive reactions of these sites to the news that Dylann learned so much interesting history from their displays. I hope this can open up a discussion about these dipshit Confederate memorials and whether bulldozers should be applied to them. \n\nMinor edits for grammar and clarity",

Here are some gems:\n\n&gt;Thats absolutely ridiculous. The average southern white had no interest in preserving slavery at all. The idea of owning a slave was laughable to the average middle-class southerner. Thats like saying that all common people today have a vested interest in shipping jobs overseas so its cheaper for big businesses. They were either\n\n&gt;1) Caught up in political, nationalistic fervor 2) Shamed into joining by the hyper-masculine culture and peer pressure 3) Drafted 4) Legitimately believed in the dominance of states rights over that of the federal government, with succession being supported in legal precedent by the declaration of independence \"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\"\n\n&gt;A poor white man was certainly NOT worth more than a slave. For work, you would actually have to PAY him. Many poor whites (especially in the Appalachian region) were completely against slavery and fought for the North e.g. West Virginia.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csc5n25\n\n&gt;The states, their leaders, and their politicians? Yes... more than likely so.. (although there are more factors than slavery, but I will not get into that because slavery was definitely a main driver).\n\n&gt;But the average soldier? They were fighting for their rights, their lands, and their homes. They didn't own slaves nor did they benefit from it. I am not saying the flag isn't a symbol of hate... it is a symbol of many things, heritage and valor included. But I would not say it ONLY stands for slavery.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csbx0f2\n\n&gt;I already started. Nobody has responded because it's easier to post things like \"nuh uhhhh\" and \"no you are\". But I'll repeat for you.\n\n&gt;For starters, most Southerners never owned a single slave. In 1860, 95% of the slaves in the US were owned by 5% of the population.\n\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csc6xd7\n&gt;Not in the mind of Lincoln and federal policy pre and post-war. Lincoln had no intention of ending slavery in the South.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csc7iiy\n\n&gt;Not even all their leaders. General Lee hated slavery.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csbxlq5\n\n\nThere are dozens more, probably hundreds. But that was just from a single comment thread.\n\nThe refutations are pretty obvious, but I'll post some anyway.\n\nOn \"average middle-class Southerners\" (I'm not even sure that was a thing in the 1800's, but I'll go with it) having no interest in preserving slavery:\n\n&gt;Defenders of slavery argued that the sudden end to the slave economy would have had a profound and killing economic impact in the South where reliance on slave labor was the foundation of their economy. The cotton economy would collapse. The tobacco crop would dry in the fields. Rice would cease being profitable.\n\n&gt;Defenders of slavery argued that if all the slaves were freed, there would be widespread unemployment and chaos. This would lead to uprisings, bloodshed, and anarchy. They pointed to the mob's \"rule of terror\" during the French Revolution and argued for the continuation of the status quo, which was providing for affluence and stability for the slaveholding class and for all free people who enjoyed the bounty of the slave society.\n\nSource- http://www.ushistory.org/us/27f.asp\n\nThe South overwhelmingly supported slavery because it represented the foundation of its economy. The idea that the \"average southern white\" had no interest in preserving slavery is as laughable as it is wrong. Why the hell did they go to war over it then, in many cases eagerly?\n\nOn the majority soldiers simply fighting for their rights, land, and homes:\n\nThis is debatable at best and patently false at worst. In the buildup to the Civil War, Lincoln never once threatened to take the homes or lands, nor did he wish to disenfranchise them in any way.He desperately wanted to keep the US together, and the idea of him being an invading force is ludicrous. But as to the soldiers fighting for their homes after the war had already started, there's something to that. The Conscription Acts after 1862 thrust thousands of fighting age men onto the front lines, and it's hard to say what their motivations were. [However, we do know that [a very large portion of the Confederate Army, including its entire initial force, was made up of militias formed by volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army#Organization), and their homes and lands were never directly threatened by the North.\n\n\nOn 95% of the slaves being owned by 5% of the population:\n\nThis number looks very much like an ass-pull, as I can find no credible sources to back it up. In fact, [the stat appears to come from a biased \"Southern Heritage\" blog that cites \"censorship data\" or some such.](http://www.southernheritage411.com/truehistory.php?th=094) Other sources put the number at [closer to a third](http://www.civilwarcauses.org/stat.htm). Either way the point is moot, because there was almost universal taqcit approval of slavery in the South, and that is more than enough to be ashamed of.\n\nOn Lincoln having no intention of ending slavery:\n\nAs I said earlier, Lincoln was desperate to keep the Union intact, and did indeed hesitate when it came to immediate emancipation. But to say that he never wanted to end it is asinine. As early as 1837 he expressed his disdain for it, and by 1861 he said this:\n\n&gt;I say now, however, as I have all the while said, that on the territorial question -- that is, the question of extending slavery under the national auspices, -- I am inflexible. I am for no compromise which assists or permits the extension of the institution on soil owned by the nation. And any trick by which the nation is to acquire territory, and then allow some local authority to spread slavery over it, is as obnoxious as any other.\n\nOh, and there was that little document he himself signed on January 1, 1863.\n\nSource- http://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/slavery.htm\n\nOn General Lee hating slavery:\n\nThis is refuted right in the thread. So I'll copy it here-\n\n&gt;In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral &amp; political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, &amp; while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former.\n\nThis users expands on that, and does a good job showing that Lee's \"hatred\" wasn't enough to stop him from supporting it in some pretty fundamental ways.\n\nSource- http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csbxql7\n\nSo there it is. Yet another slavery revisionist history thread. Let's hope it's a while before the next one...",

        "text": "Edit: Damn I butchered this title worse than the British butchered the Imperial Guard\n\nSo today is the 200th anniversary of Waterloo when an Anglo/Dutch/Prussian force led by the Duke of Wellington beat Napoleon's army and descriptively ended the Career of the First French Emperor. \n\nNaturally its still kinda of a sticking point for the French and one of Britain's greatest imperial victories, earning Wellington a spot among British imperial heroes like Nelson, Wolfe, etc. \n\nAnyways today we shall be looking at some people who are still a little angry about Waterloo and Napoleon's downfall. Two threads in question, [one from](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3a9oo3/on_july_18th_1815_angloprussian_forces_led_by_the/) /r/history and [one from](http://np.reddit.com/r/france/comments/3a9nxw/on_this_day_in_1815_the_duke_of_wellington/) /r/France which is currently being brigaded by teaboos (Brits). \n\nLets start with /r/history:\n\nA comment saying \"celebrate\" [is met with](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3a9oo3/on_july_18th_1815_angloprussian_forces_led_by_the/csaxjl4):\n\n&gt;Not something to celebrate. What a step backwards for the rights of man, the arts, liberalism, and forward thought.\nNapoleon is the best case in history where history has so obviously been warped by the victor.\n\nMight as well make a chart. Napoleon's ideas survived his defeat, by the time of Waterloo Napoleon's goal above all else was to survive. He wasn't planning on spreading the revolution any farther, its not like Waterloo was a case of reactionaries scheming to stop revolutions from popping up over Europe (although that did happen). As for \"arts\" did Art stop with Napoleon's defeat? Did everyone in the middle of writing books, and painting just stop and say \"well shit Napoleon lost, guess we can't be artsy anymore\"? \n\nSame person goes on to make this comment about Wellington's strategy at Waterloo:\n\n&gt;You mean hold on until allies arrive?\n\nYes, Wellington only knew how to hold positions until Allies arrived. He certainly didn't kick the French out of Spain and launch an invasion of Southern France, certainly not at all. \n\nMoving on:\n\n&gt;As happened later in WWII, Russians actually did the 'work'. The Grande Armee was decimated during the campaign in Russia.\n\nThis meme can't be escaped, at all. Eventually we'll get to the point where every war is just won via the Russian winter. \"You know in the Persian invasion of Greece, the Russians really did most of the work, all Athens did was send lease supplies.\"\n\n&gt;It's kind of like when a big schoolyard bully is beat up and knocked out by a smaller kid (Russia), and he gets back up a few minutes later and another kid (Britian) pushes him down and claims credit.\n\nMore shitty analogies about schoolyards and European wars, great!\n\n&gt;Waterloo pretty much ended the franco dominated world and ushered in the anglo-centered world we live in today.\nIt's amazing how france went from the greatest and wealthiest empire in the world at that time to a laughingstock within a few years under napoleon.\n\nNot even close. The Congress of Vienna didn't cause all that much damage to France considering how much the allies could have realistically demanded from France. France remained, arguably, the premier land based European power until 1870, when Germany took the lead. France had still had an amazing reputation and there soldiers were considered some of the best in Europe (and even maintained that reputation through out the 20th century). \n\nFor fun lets tackle a random teaboo who appears in the thread:\n\n&gt;While obviously British commanders wouldn't deliberately throw small forces at much larger armies and expect victory, it's important to note that British troops were generally of superior quality to their European counterparts.\n\nLets quote a historian on the matter:\n\n&gt;The fact that the British army was composed entirely of professional military men carries none of the elite implications that the expression may suggest to the modern reader. The soldierly profession, badly paid and subject to the harshest discipline, was not greatly appreciated in the United Kingdom—was, in fact, a decidedly proletarian vocation....Furthermore, in the course of the Napoleonic Wars, the British army, desperately short of men, had been obliged to avail itself of the reservoir of recruits constituted by the militia: Men chosen by lot in local drawings to join the territorial regiments were strongly pressured to sign up for the regular army after completing their training...\n\n&gt;The vast majority of soldiers still came from the ranks of the otherwise unemployed, men who had not found another way to earn a living. The few available statistics show that around half of the troops had been farm laborers and the rest textile workers or apprentice tradesmen. In such a class-conscious society as England's, the proletarian origins of the troops opened a chasm between them and their officers; one day the Duke of Wellington, a man devoid of democratic feelings and little given to mincing his words, said that the English army was recruited from among \"the scum of the earth.\"\n\nMoving onto /r/france \n\nSorry for the broken English, its being translated. \n\n&gt;Britain was not an absolute monarchy\nYou're right indeed, it was a parody of constitutional monarchy were one house was reserved to the nobility, and the other was controlled by the aristocracy because of how the election system worked.\n\n&gt;The French Empire under Napoleon was.\nNo, it was still a republic. Governed by an emperor yes, but with a parliament constituted from the people, not nobility. It's somewhat similar to Roma at some points in History.\n\nBritain wasn't a picture of democracy, it still have massive issues with wealth inequality and only a small percentage could realistically influence politics in any meaningful way. But Napoleon neutered the legislative bodies and was certainly no picture of democracy. I don't know if Republics can include divine Emperors, but they generally don't. \n\n&gt;No offense but Wellington was about to be destroyed until Blücher came (at the very least, he was on a bad spot).\nBy the way, Wellington had a lot of qualities, but he was also known for being a bad military strategist.\n\n&gt;Wellington and the British army almost never fought (except in Spain, which was a very specific war moreover) during Napoleon's reign. Their soldiers and officers had little experience. Actually, even Blücher and his army despised them.\nThus, Wellington did a lot of mistakes that allowed Napoleon to realistically hope to win the war (a thing that, I admit even as a French, should not had happened according to the circumstances). For instance, on the 18th june 1815, the army of England and Prussia should have been already reunited at the beggining, but Wellington was way too slow.\n\nSo according to this Wellington was inexperienced and the British army almost never fought. Of course lost in all this is how Wellington managed to tie down around 500,000 French troops and bleed around 100,000 per year (according to Chandler) and defeat many of Napoleon's marshals. But no Wellington was bad at war, Aux armes, citoyens! \n\n&gt;Britain a nation of shopkeepers and bankers. Always watching their enemies bleed from afar, waiting for that moment when they can bravely shoulder their hired mercenaries aside to strike the mortal blow and claim victory.\n\nStupid perfidious Albion, always finding ways to win wars without sacrificing large amounts of their citizens in the process. Don't they know that's cheating? Its almost as bad as pretending to be someone's ally, stationing troops in their country, and then at the last moment turning on them (cough Peninsular war, cough). \n\n&gt; Oh really? You'd take France which was occupied &amp; collaborating with the Nazi's?\nIt must be hard work for you French to constantly have to excuse your country's history? If only the French put as much effort into winning wars.\nFrance will always be a nation of salty losers.\n\nDamn [this guy](http://np.reddit.com/r/france/comments/3a9nxw/on_this_day_in_1815_the_duke_of_wellington/csay8b2) went straight for the throat.\n\nJust to end off with a fun fact. Today is also the 75th anniversary of DeGaulle's appeal on BBC Radio which implored the French people to fight on against Germany and kicked off the Free French movement. ",

        "text": "Steven Universe, for the uninitiated is a fantastic show about a kid and his alien friends, protecting Earth from various dangers. In the worlds lore, the aliens (The Crystal Gems) rebelled against their Homeworld when they began to threaten the destruction of Earth for their own needs.\n\nThe war in the canon of the show, happened 5000 years ago on Earth, in the 30th Century BCE.\n\nIn the latest episode, the Crystal Gem Pearl says that some of the first battles for Earth were fought in a swordfighting Arena and that it was there that she was **introduced to the human concept of knighthood.**\n\nIn the 30th Century BCE.\n\nIt has been established that the war was fought over 5000 years ago. So we can assume that 5000 years ago the first battles in The Arena were fought.\n\n**'Knights' as a concept and as an actual rank in nobility did not become a thing until the very early European Early Middle Ages.**\n\nAnd even then knighthood, what it MEANT to BE a knight, went through *constant* changes.\n\nToday, knighthood is merely an honorary title.... in the Early Middle Ages, in, let's say, 1066 in the service of William The Conqueror, your 'knighthood' would just mean 'soldier wealthy enough to own chainmail armour and a horse'.\n\nKnighthood went through constant changes in function, appearance and doctrine, but it most certainly did not exist 5000 years ago.\n\nWhile the earliest incarnation of 'kinghthood' (as in a noble mounted warrior) came from Ancient Rome (as i said, knighthood changed massivley through out all of the Middle Ages), Ancient Rome as we know it, didn't exist 5000 years ago on Earth....\n\n[This is what was going on 5000 years ago, in the 30th Century BCE.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_century_BC)\n\nThis is the age when TROY was founded, when the Neolithic period ended (in some periods of the world). The age where Stonehenge was built, The Minoan Civilisation... the Fourth Pharaoh of EGYPT. This was the age when Sumerians began erecting cities and settlements, the age when the Egyptians invented hyeropglyphic writing.\n\nThis was the very infancy of complex human civilisations..... knights were a *loooooooooooooong* way away from even existing.\n\nSo how could Pearl become introduced to the 'human concept of knighthood' when knighthood did not even exist? It just makes no sense :l\n\nHowever [as some comenters in this thread pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3a30qh/one_small_thing_that_bugged_me_personally_with/), it is possible that the character saying this was merely conflating the concept of a devoted warrior, to what would later become knighthood. However that doesn't change that the usage of the term and the concept does not apply.\n\nIf anyone has any corrections i'll be glad to hear them. The show is still amazing though, i don't want to sound mean. I love it to death.\n\n",

But in the interest of sanity I won't be touching it because genocide Olympics is stupid.\n\n&gt;Hitler\n\nBlah blah, we all know this one. Wasn't actually a socialist not going to bother typing out the arguments we have seen a million times. Here are some[ helpful](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/sipie/to_what_extent_was_the_national_socialist_german/c4eepc8) [answers](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/22ox1w/what_is_fascism/cgoz902) from /u/depanneur if you are out of the loop. \n\nNow for the newer parts:\n\n&gt;Enver Pasha\n\nNever seen a claim that he was a socialist. That's a rather new one actually. Pasha had some liberal ideas about reforming the Ottoman Empire. But he was also a hardcore Turick nationalist, which is kinda of the opposite of socialism which tends to be very anti-nationalist at least in this part of history. \n\nHe did have some contact with the Bolsheviks after WWI and the fall of the Ottomans; eventually he was asked to help put down Turkic groups revolting against the Bolsheviks. Pasha promptly switched sides and led a Pro-Turkic nationalist revolt against the Bolsheviks. Pasha made heavy use of religious imagery and calling himself the \"Commander-in-Chief of all the Armies of Islam, Son-in-Law of the Caliph and Representative of the Prophet.\" Not very socialist at all.\n\n&gt;Leopold II\n\nThis one is even stranger. \n\nI'm giving credit to /u/Post_Capitalist who wrote a debunking of this in /r/badpolitics :\n\n&gt;This is the first time I have ever heard of King Leopold referred to as a socialist. A quick look into his life I could find almost nothing on his political views, he seemed to have few and I could find no instances of where he referred to himself as a socialist and was criticized by the Belgian Socialist movement for his activities in Zaire. However that's really not saying anything because almost everyone in Europe was outraged by the human rights abuses occurring in the Congo, it was one of the first instance of real international outrage.\n\n&gt;As for the Congo Free State, it was actually his own private nation. When Africa was divided up he claimed The Congo as his own property. The death toll here is also inaccurate. Though some sources argue the CFS may have caused the deaths of 20 million people there is actually no way of knowing the number of people killed. This is mostly due to the Belgians not keeping any records. However scholars agree the population of the Congo was smaller than before Leopold took over and most estimate about 10 million died.\n\n",

        "text": "I feel disloyal for bringing an article that extensively quotes a member of staff at the Museum at FIT, but it's really ridiculous. The gist of the article is to show that styles of dress reveal women's status in the workplace - but while it gets the facts *basically* right, it makes a huge, huge mistake in treating work clothes as somehow separate from fashion as a whole. Overall, the article is based around finding pictures of women in offices in different decades and then coming up with reasons that their clothing symbolizes being held back specifically at work, ignoring the fact that all the women they picture are wearing what would also be fashionable outside of the workplace.\n\n[To See How Far Women Have Come, Just Look at Their Work Clothes](http://mic.com/articles/120163/to-see-how-far-women-have-come-just-look-at-their-work-clothes)\n\n&gt;\"Dressing for work\" may no longer apply to a mass of casual millennial workers, but the mantra's history reveals a timeline of slow-but-steady progress for women at large.\n\nAn early clue that this is a forced narrative of progress.\n\n**1910-1930s: If women are working, they're wearing men's clothes... or pearls.**\n\nThe article's first point is that women who worked in factory-type jobs generally wore \"the same uniforms as male workers\", which isn't even true in the [photograph they use as an illustration](http://thumbs.mic.com/YmQwYTFkZTc3MyMvUTRoVzJQTDJrMUxoT0JDalFjNVp5VEdWYlZVPS80NngyNDE6MzQ2MngyMjUzLzkwMHg1MzAvZmlsdGVyczpxdWFsaXR5KDcwKS9odHRwOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9wb2xpY3ltaWMtaW1hZ2VzL3Mydmp1cXdxZmh1ZzQwZ2pvZjR6azVrOGVrOWFhcmxkNmZkb3Z5aXltdm55YWQyc2dtdjVibXF3eW1yeWlxNmsuanBn.jpg) so who knows what's going on. In reality, photographs of women [during](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-1f19-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) [this](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47d9-4e00-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) [period](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47d9-4e5d-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) most frequently show white shirtwaists and dark skirts in factories, which as also a very common outfit outside of work situations at the time; [photos of offices](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47d9-4e5d-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) show the same thing. [Real uniforms](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-fa1e-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) started to come into use in factories in the mid-1920s, and were generally used in the 1930s. They were definitely not the same as men's uniforms.\n\n&gt;For the small number of women who worked as stenographers, teachers, bookkeepers or secretaries, clothes were the same in the office as out — think pearls, skirts and heels.\n\nThis is true (minus the pearls - don't know why they said that), but it's true of literally every entry in the article, so I'm not sure why they put it in.\n\n**1930s-1940s: Women workers welcome, as long as they stay in their skirts.**\n\nThis is kind of a weird thing to say on two levels. For one thing, it implies that women on the whole were being made to wear skirts unwillingly, and assuming that people of the past had the same mindsets as ourselves but were stuck in bad situations is an entirely unproductive way of thinking. For another, this includes the era of [female munitions workers in boiler suits](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47de-842c-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99), which is a lot more like actually wearing men's uniforms than in the earlier years. I don't even know.\n\n&gt;Thus, the 1930s saw the creation of the standard dark suit, which changed very little once the troops returned home, Mears said. The clothes were modeled after menswear styles, with elements like pinstripes and wool.\n\nI would put the creation in the later 1920s, but at that point it was with more of a cardigan than a jacket, so I'll give them that. But you really can't elide the 1930s and the war years like that and just say that clothes were \"modeled after menswear\" to imply a deeper meaning - there are all sorts of elements that get described as being taken from menswear, and in large part they derive from cycles in fashion rather than saying something meaningful about women's roles. They often overlap with stereotypically feminine elements as well. For example, the fashionable figure in the early 1930s was very willowy and delicate, yet you can find [lapels and belts in it](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e3-b29c-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99). Later in the decade, you get [broader/more emphasized shoulders but also a narrow waist](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e3-b256-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99), which you *could* put down to \"apologizing for masculine elements with an hourglass figure\" or something along those lines, but you could also see a connection to earlier periods such as the [mid-1890s](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-f215-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) or [late 1900s](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-fe60-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99). And again [one of the pictures they use](http://thumbs.mic.com/ODQ0N2YzNzg2ZSMvMTZpNmQ5d0NzM0FZVXQ4V3dMUXI1QXk3ZHV3PS8xMDh4MjA4OjQ1MjF4MjgwNi85MDB4NTMwL2ZpbHRlcnM6cXVhbGl0eSg3MCkvaHR0cDovL3MzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20vcG9saWN5bWljLWltYWdlcy94N3N5cHV4dG9iY256bWtqYmp4Ymk1bGpwYThoZmVpN3dzY2N5aWhnb3Y2cDhidnNueHlrdjN2ZmVxbHF0Y2JkLmpwZw==.jpg) has nothing o do with the point at hand - padded shoulders are not inherently about imitating a man's body.\n\nAlso, wool had been continuously used to make women's clothing for thousands of years, so calling it a connection to menswear is completely ridiculous. \n\n**1950s: At work or at home, it's all about the \"good housewife\" look.**\n\nI ... what?\n\n&gt;After all, women were essentially wearing buttoned-up housewife clothes in and outside the house, as one look at Peggy's early workplace attire from Mad Men shows.\n\nI can't figure out how to address this because I don't understand what \"housewife clothes\" are supposed to be. The best I can do is that 1950s clothes look like \"housewife clothes\" to the writer because the stereotypical image of a housewife is [a woman ca. 1955 in a  full skirt](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/a1974390-ab14-0132-a409-58d385a7bbd0) - but that is a terrible, recursive analysis. Also, Peggy's early costuming in Mad Men is girlish for the period, not any kind of wifely.\n\n**1960s: As they move up, women remain \"respectable\" with ladylike dresses and high necklines.**\n\nJust as I'm getting kind of tired of explaining why this wrong article is entirely wrong, I think the writer is getting tired of coming up with ridiculous rationalizations. Again, \"ladylike\" has no inherent meaning, and the impression I get is that the writer just associates ladylike-ness with adult women's dress in the 1960s because they've grown up with the image of a ladylike woman dressed that way. \n\n&gt;To cement their rising positions amid the tumult of \"youth culture\" outside office doors, women adopted loose but conservative styles. Thin sweaters, above-the-knee dresses, modest shell tanks — women still looked like women, and they still weren't running the place.\n\nWomen's clothing in the office is completely, entirely, 100% related to what's in style at any given time! \"Modest\" necklines and hemlines were in style [even in](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/96103) [couture](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/81475). You can even describe the clothes of [Courrèges](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/95322), who's strongly identified with miniskirts, go-go boots, and high-end youth culture, as conservative by the standards of today - and his stuff was shocking at the time.\n\nThe rest isn't really my wheelhouse so I'm not going to try to be specific about it, but it's more of the same, culminating in the assertion that only now are women allowed to be assertive/powerful as well as feminine because of skinny jeans. It's a terribly jumbled essay that tells two progress narratives and forces them to correlate, disregarding what twentieth-century people may have considered feminine/masculine about their clothing in order to prove a point. It's Mic.com, I know!  But still.\n\nIn the end, the actual message is \"fashion in the past was monolithic, but women today can choose what they want to wear!\" But that's bullshit, because people always feel they have a lot of choice in their dress and that earlier decades boil down to simple stereotypes. In twenty years we're going to have 2010s themed parties, and I'm not totally sure what we'll wear to them but you can bet it'll be a very simplified version of what's available and liked today.

        "text": "[The Magna Carta enshrined our liberties - now we must fight for them again](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/magna-carta-800-years-human-rights-act)\n\nThe Magna Carta seems to have really \"inspired\" the British media; I'll try to keep this focused on the history in the face of some of the most banal rhetoric I've laid my eyes upon. Quick disclaimer: I'll be saying \"the Magna Carta\" even though I know that's wrong because it sounds, and looks, weird to me without the definite article.\n\nThis is a follow up to [Reuters does the Magna Carta... badly](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/39m6gr/reuters_does_the_magna_carta_badly/) in some ways, though I can assure you I have *never* liked the Guardian.\n\n&gt; The sealing of the Magna Carta... effectively ripped up the idea that monarchs have an invincible and divine right to rule\n\nShots fired! \"Divine Right\" wasn't used in the narrative of English monarchical sovereignty until at least the 16th Century. Also, monarchs had never been \"invincible\" - the Norman conquest handily proved that. Perhaps the common person held the monarch in a sacred and unassailable position but the barons, who fought a rebellion following the failure of the 1215 Magna Carta, certainly did not.\n\n&gt; [The Magna Carta] established the contemporary powers of parliament\n\nI'm not sure what the use of \"contemporary\" means here but considering the Queen is currently nothing more than a figurehead (whose royal prerogative, if used, would cause a crisis) and English monarchs before the Civil War summoned and dismissed parliament wherever they bloody well felt like it, it seems a touch rash to draw a straight line between Runnymede and Westminster.\n\nAs for the \"power\" of parliament: parliament, technically, has little real power. Any new legislation agreed upon must undergo royal ascent by ol' Liz II. The Magna Carta says nothing about parliament, the powers of parliament, nor does it use the word parliament. So, no.\n\n&gt; When our rights are infringed, when we seek justice, when we challenge things that are patently unfair… it is the Magna Carta we turn to.\n\n*Holy shit, what are you smoking?* Without even getting into the realm of whether or not The Law is / isn't / should be \"fair\" and what \"fair\" even means, the Magna Carta is 800 years old. There have been numerous reworkings of the English legal and democratic system that make the Magna Carta utterly redundant, not least the bit where we got rid of the monarchy for a few years. It is not a legal document that is used in civil or criminal cases, nor should it be... mostly because the 1215 version got repealed by the pope 3 months later.\n\nFor comparison, try the \"fairness\" evoked by the Human Rights Acts, the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, the Representation of the People Act 1918, or the repeal of Section 28 (2003).\n\n&gt; It’s because of the Magna Carta that, in 2003, 3 million of us were able to come together to protest against the Iraq war. \n\nThe claim of three million was by the organisers of the event so this number cannot be entirely trusted. There was no ticketing or polling or anything of that sort so any number attached to that is entirely spurious but needless to say it was a big march, probably the largest in UK history.\n\nThe Magna Carta does not enshrine, permit or mention the freedom of assembly. Instead, we have the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to thank or, if you want to be grandiose, Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n&gt; It’s the Magna Carta that means we can legally fight cases where a severely disabled person...\n\nNo, that's a basic principle of Common Law which pre-dates the shenanigans of the early 13th Century by quite some time to the Assize of Clarendon in 1166.\n\n&gt; ...ironically, it’s the Magna Carta that has ultimately allowed us to vote in a government that seems hell bent on destroying it.\n\nThat's not irony because:\n\n1. The government has no interest in the Magna Carta other than redefining its narrative to suit its purposes, much like the moron that wrote this article.\n\n2. The way we vote is down to the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, a much more recent piece of legislation.\n\nLook, I get it, legislative history isn't sexy or awe-inspiring. Whilst I've mentioned a few acts here, most of them are evolutions and developments of older bits of political machinery. The names of landmark documents aren't as catchy as the Magna Carta but that doesn't mean they're not as important. We can't keep doing this, we can't keep romanticising the past when we're basing our ideation of some glorious future on a spat between some trumped-up barons and a hapless king 800 years ago. It's history, England, get over it.",

It must be from \"White Cargo\" and nowhere else.\n\nAnyhow, R5:\n\nI'm sure its obvious to everyone, as this type of stuff shows up in here a lot, but the myth of Irish \"slavery\" is largely overblown. While the Irish did suffer tremendously at the hands of the English at various times, and under the indentured servitude system specifically, neither their treatment nor the scale of the operation was ever anywhere on par with chattel slavery of Africans. This myth has persisted largely thanks to revisionists and racists who seek to diminish the atrocity of slavery by false equivalency. \n\nFor further explanation, allow me to excerpt /u/agentdcf's reply to an /r/AskHistorians [post:](http://no.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2pi4qm/how_accurate_is_the_proclamation_that_irish/cmwxmaa)\n\n&gt;[H]istorians over the past two generations (roughly) have found in studying both African slaves and European indentures that it really doesn't make sense to think of Irish or other Europeans working in the Americas, even those in some sort of bonded arrangement, as \"slaves.\" There are major categorical differences: indentures, even Irish political prisoners, had some kind of legal identity, while African slaves largely did not, and the large bulk of indentured servants received land or at least their freedom after a period of service; slaves obviously did not. This is true of convicts as well. They also did not pass their slave status on to their children, while the racialization of African slavery meant that the children of African slaves were also slaves.\n\nEdit: Also, I'm not a history person at all, so if anyone can directly rebut some of these specific claims that'd be neat. \n\nEdit 2: aaaaaand he's regular in that sub that is a raccoon city.

They are guilty of bad history in the first degree, and as such, will be subjected to a thorough posting-about. So there.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nBecause the defendants are not here to speak for themselves (won't it be awkward if they show up in the comments? that'd be awkward), I shall reproduce their statements in their entirety for the benefit of the denizens of /r/badhistory. Let it be known that one month ago, the following exchange occurred:\n\n&gt; The Ted Bundy Miami trial was nationally televised in 1979.\n\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you're right, Smarts was the first one televised in its entirety - gavel to gavel.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; actually the first one was in 1955\n\nwith the last comment receiving 6 upvotes. I am here to tell you that this is wrong - WRONG!\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n\nThere are several problems when we look at this post. As the comments rightfully point out, the statement that Pamela Smart's trial in 1991 was \"the first televised trial in American history\" is flat-out wrong. The first televised trial was the trial of Billy Eugene Manley. In 1953, Billy Eugene Manley stood accused of murdering a police officer in Oklahoma City. While he was ultimately found guilty, what's important about his trial is not the verdict as what happened during it. Largely in response to the media circus that was the Lindbergh kidnapping trial, in 1937, the American Bar Association issued Canon 35, which stated that photography and recording should not be allowed in a courtroom because it would:\n\n&gt; detract from the essential dignity of the proceedings, degrade the court, and create misconceptions with respect thereto in the mind of the public and should not be permitted.\n\n([Source](https://books.google.com/books?id=mzf1sFw0NdcC&amp;pg=PA769&amp;lpg=PA769&amp;dq=detract+from+the+essential+dignity+of+the+proceedings,+degrade+the+court,+and+create+misconceptions+with+respect+thereto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ztww35Biae&amp;sig=ukxXrqPLQCsxu4ctKxz0iVlxZkg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI4b6z0qeNxgIVDgiSCh3R4ACN#v=onepage&amp;q=detract%20from%20the%20essential%20dignity%20of%20the%20proceedings%2C%20degrade%20the%20court%2C%20and%20create%20misconceptions%20with%20respect%20thereto&amp;f=false)). Quite understandably, this finding by the ABA led to controversy and conflict with journalists and other people who felt that the public had a right to know how court proceedings went, and that trials ought to be more public and accessible. Journalists also had stories to sell, and the profits that the Lindbergh trial had made demonstrated there was a market for trial stories, and especially sensational ones. Criminal cases were coming into vogue, the more lurid, the better. \n\nCongress, however, agreed with the ABA, and in 1946, passed a law banning radio broadcasts or photography in federal court rooms. In 1952, the ABA amended Canon 35 to include video cameras, using much the same arguments of detracting from dignity. However, this extension ran afoul of FCC regulations like the fairness doctrine from 1949 that stated that the media were \"public trustees\" responsible for addressing issues of public importance. How was public importance defined? Who knows! That's the fun of law!\n\nThe debates surrounding broadcasting and courtroom dignity came to a head with the 1953 trial of Billy Eugene Manley. As televised trials go, it was probably as unobtrusive as possible. A floodlight was added to a chandelier, a microphone was placed in the middle of the floor, the camera was placed in a special booth at the back of the room, and the judge had the opportunity to unobtrusively order the crew to stop taping at any time using a button on the bench. The film was edited and then shown as part of WKY-TV's nightly broadcast. Unobtrusive or no, though, the fact that elements of the case - and a similar case in 1955 - were televised set off a firestorm of controversy. Some judges, like Judge W.H. Duckworth, said that it \"thwarted the very essence of justice,\" while others argued that those judges were just old fogies who didn't like shiny things. States around the country started hearing arguments in their supreme courts about whether trials could or should be televised, and what weight Canon 35 had. \n\nThese cases and the conflict within them came to a head with the 1965 Supreme Court ruling in [Estes v. Texas,](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/381/532/case.html) where the Supreme Court over-turned a conviction because of the belief that television crews had been too much of a disruption for Estes to receive a fair trial. What was important in the Estes v. Texas ruling, though, wasn't just that television cameras were considered disruptive, but that, if technology developed, there was a possibility that they wouldn't be disruptive in the future - they were just disruptive at that particular point in time. \n\nEnter [Chandler v. Florida](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/449/560/case.html), a case heard before the Supreme Court in 1980, once again about the constitutionality of cameras in the court room. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that, despite the previous ruling and despite the high amount of attention and news coverage the case received, it was not unconstitutional for a criminal case to be broadcast on television. Many states agreed, with some - like Florida - having previously made state courts open to television cameras. This was huge, as it essentially set the precedent of saying that there could be both a media circus and a fair trial. It was this case that set the stage for the heavily publicised trials of the late 80s, 90s, and 2000s. The fact that names like Pamela Smart and O.J. Simpson are household names is because of the ruling that television cameras were not unconstitutional and didn't desecrate the court.\n\nSo it's safe to say that the first televised trial in the US wasn't in 1955 - it was in 1953, and while it may not have been in its entirety, it still counts. If we want the first ever trial that was televised from gavel to gavel, that was the trial of Adolf Eichmann, which was broadcast in Israel in 1961, but which - for obvious reasons - attracted a huge international audience. If we want the first nationally televised trial, it's that one, even if the nation it was televised in wasn't the US. \n\nIn 1964, Jack Ruby's trial verdict became the first to be televised nationally, once again raising the question of what qualifies as a \"televised trial.\" Does a trial need to be shown in its entirety to count as being nationally televised? If it doesn't have to be shown in its entirety, then Jack Ruby takes the distinction of having the first trial televised across the US. Otherwise, the first nationally televised trial is indeed the 1979 trial of Ted Bundy.\n\nBundy's trial, quite obviously, was incredibly sensational. The crime he was accused of - murdering several women in the Chi Omega sorority at Florida State University - was heinous enough on its own, but beyond that, he awaited trial for killing at least thirty-six people across four states. People watched in fascination and horror. More than two hundred and fifty reporters from around the world came and recorded the trial, taking the highlights and showing them on television. It wasn't gavel to gavel coverage, but it was very complete, and it presented an image of Bundy as a person that people sucked up. Bundy himself loved the publicity, using it as a way to soapbox about the evils of pornography. He was found guilty. What a shocker.\n\nThis brings me to the question of the first trial that was televised gavel-to-gavel. As I said previously, if we're looking outside the US, it's going to be Adolf Eichmann and the trial that introduce millions of people to what the Holocaust actually was. Inside the US, though, it is indeed the 1991 trial of Pamela Smart. Smart stood accused of hiring her teenage lover to kill her husband, a story which on its own managed to capture the public's attention, even without court room antics and the testimonies of witnesses. The fact that she was young and attractive, too, and seemed to fulfil \"black widow\" stereotypes undoubtedly brought extra attention. For fourteen days, her trial got some of the highest ratings on television, and Smart herself reveled in it. Of course, questions were raised during and after about whether or not the television cameras and media attention affected the verdict, but at the time, it became abundantly clear that trials could sell and attract huge amounts of attention. While it wasn't the first or the largest trial coverage, I'd argue that the Pamela Smart trial made it very clear that there was a market just for trials and for reality TV more generally, and that it played a huge role in setting off trials as events.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\nWhile the defendants must be lauded for trying to tell the story of televised trials, their explanation is woefully lacking, and in parts, completely wrong. It is the hope of this opinion that their mistakes can be rectified and the history about which they are trying to speak better understood.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n[Exhibit A](http://remember.org/eichmann/intro): A brief introduction to the television coverage of Adolf Eichmann's trial\n\n[Exhibit B](http://www.npr.org/2011/03/27/134821325/the-eichmann-trial-fifty-years-later): Another report about the trial of Adolf Eichmann\n\n[Exhibit C](http://www.cpp.edu/~jis/1997/Switzer.pdf): A paper by Mary Kay Switzer primarily focusing on the television coverage of the O.J.

Essentially, you have a giant [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) paradox. Let's look at some possibilities:\n\n*Which country has the longest continuous list of leaders?* This is Japan's claim; the list of Japanese emperors stretches with minimal interruption to before 600 CE. China can also make a claim to go back to the Qin dynasty, but there have been substantial ethnic, geographic, and cultural shifts that make it hard to determine when \"China\" begins. [The Shang dynasty, for instance, is not generally included in the sequence of Chinese dynasties.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty) Japan, also, saw similar shifts as during the list of Japanese emperors there have been substantial border changes (the annexation of Hokkaido and Ryukyu and the brief occupation of Korea and the Japanese Empire) and political changes (feudal absolute monarchy =&gt; failed state =&gt; shogunate =&gt; constitutional monarchy =&gt; fascist state =&gt; American occupation =&gt; constitutional monarchy) that make it impossible to objectively determine when the modern Japanese state began.\n\n*Which country has been independent the longest?* San Marino claims to be independent since the 300s, but the actual date at which it obtained full independence is ambiguous; its status during the Napoleonic Wars was complicated and its independence was merely \"confirmed\" in the 1860s when the other Italian city-states had all [surrendered to the Sardinia-led Kingdom of Italy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_San_Marino)\n\n*Which country has the oldest system of government?* San Marino can also make this claim, although its constitution appears to have been substantially rewritten in 1974. The UK can as well, but it has an uncodified constitution that has undergone a lot of substantial changes; the modern House of Commons didn't really exist until 1832 and the monarch and House of Lords only gradually lost their power. Even the US can step in here as it has sometimes claimed to have the world's oldest constitution, although again there is the ship of Theseus issue of dealing with the various amendments.\n\n*Which country has the oldest ethnic makeup?* Don't know enough to answer this one, but I'd probably say either Papua New Guinea or somewhere in West Africa like Burkina Faso that was unattractive to mass immigration during the colonial period.\n\n*Which country has the oldest ethnic groups?* I've heard that the Khoisan and Australian Aborigines are some of the earliest ethnic and genetic groups to split off from their neighbors, but they are small minorities of the current population in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Australia respectively.\n\n*Which country was home to the first \"civilizations\"?* Generally Sumeria is considered to be the first classical civilization.\n\n*Which country was home to the first unified nation-state?* Ancient Egypt I believe.\n\n*Which country has maintained the same borders for the longest period of time?* I don't know.\n\n*Which country has had the longest history free from outside rule or invasion?* Looking on Wikipedia, Nepal and Bhutan seem to have gone without invasion; even [San Marino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Marino) saw action during WWII.\n\nTotal list of claimants for the world's oldest country:\n\nSan Marino, China, Japan, Nepal, Bhutan, UK, USA, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, Iraq, Burkina Faso based on the criteria I've listed.",

The Muslim generals also carved up the remnants of the Mughal Empire into tiny Kingdoms while only recognizing the Mughal Emperor as a ceremonial figurehead.\n\n&gt;Rajput Hindus fought for the Mughals, whereas there were quite a few Muslim generals that were fighting for the Marathas. It wasn't Hindu v. Muslim as much as it was, who was more powerful and power hungry.\n\nContinuing from /u/thinkthank 's point,after the Durranis 'smashed up North India', and left,the Marathas established a protectorate over Delhi,keeping the Mughals as figureheads (with the coronation of Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II in 1772). And it is *really* misleading to present any Maratha ruler apart from Shivaji as a 'crusader against those evil Muslim invader Mughals',because you have them with titles like *Vakil-ul-Mutlaq* (Regent of the Mughal Empire), Amir-ul-Umara(Head of the *amir*s). And it is very rare to find any ruler who had thrown off all pretences of alleigance to the Mughals(which even powerful Maratha rulers,in all their scheming politics and battles,took here).\n\nAlso,during the 1700s-1800s period,the most powerful 'Muslim powers' in India were the Nawabs of Bengal the Nawab of Awadh(Oudh) and the Nizam of Hyderabad. Bengal fell to the British in 1757,and by 1801,Awadh and Hyderabad were forced to enter into a Subsidary Alliance with the British East India company to prevent them from being invaded by them. The terms of the Subsidary alliance were:\n\n\n1. An Indian ruler entering into a subsidiary alliance with the British had to accept British forces within his territory and also agreed to pay for their maintenance.\n1. The ruler would accept a British Resident in his state.\n1. An Indian ruler who entered into a subsidiary alliance would not enter into any further alliance with any other power, nor would he declare war against any power without the permission of the British.\n1. The ruler would not employ any Europeans other than the British, and if he were already doing so, he would dismiss them.\n1. In case of a conflict with any other state, he would agree the resolution decided upon by the British.\n1. The ruler would acknowledge the East India Company as the paramount power in India.\n1. In return for the ruler accepting its conditions, the Company undertook to protect the state from external dangers and internal disorders.\n1. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payments required by the alliance, then part of their territory was to be taken away as a penalty.\n\nWhich basically meant that all the external and foreign affairs of these Nawabs and rulers were under British control.\n\nBy 1803,after the battles of Assaye and Argaon,most of the major Maratha powers(those noble patriotic^TM Hindus) were forced to accept this Subsidary Alliance.-The Sindhias,the Gaekwads,and the *Peshwa* of the Marathas(1802).\n\nIn the 1857 rebellion(or war of independence,depends on how nationalistic the historians are),it is seen that among the Marathas,it was mainly the claimant of the deposed Peshwa,Nana Sahib who participated in it. The Maratha Maharajas of Gaekwad and Sindhia,on the other hands,sided with the British in this case.",

        "text": "Googling [world's oldest democracy](http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/what-is-the-worlds-oldest-democracy) leads to a long list of contenders, including the Iroquois, Switzerland, San Marino, Finland, and the Faroes, Iceland, and the Isle of Man. I'll focus on the last three for the R5 because their histories are so parallel (it's basically the same story of a Norse parliament that evaporates but is resurrected) but will address some of the other contenders as well.\n\n&gt;The title of oldest continuously functioning democracy is more hotly contested. Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the Isle of Man all have local parliaments founded in the ninth and 10th centuries, when Vikings pillaged, plundered and set up legislative bodies on the sea-islands of far northern Europe. Iceland’s national parliament, the Althing, dates back to A.D. 930, but it spent centuries under Norwegian and Danish rule.\n\nThese three can all be dismissed for the exact same reason: that they aren't really continuous insomuch as they are names that have been recycled for a host of consultative bodies and supreme courts as well as actual parliaments. By that standard the French medieval *parlement* is the same as the modern French Parliament.\n\n**Iceland** - The [continuity of the Althing is debatable at best.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Althing#Historical_background) The Althing-as-parliament was defunct by the 1300s; a rump Althing served as the Supreme Court of Iceland, and in 1800 it was fully replaced by a High Court modeled after those of continental Europe which still exists. For 45 years, there was no Althing. The next time that an entity called the Althing existed in Iceland was in 1845, when it reemerged as a limited consultative body; a parliamentary Althing did not resume until the 1870s. The Althing is therefore only continuous if you ignore the 45 years when it didn't exist and the radical changes that it underwent.\n\nThe **Faroes** follow a similar trajectory. Their parliament began losing power in the 1600s and was [abolished from 1816 to 1852.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B8gting) Again, its claim to continuity requires ignoring over thirty years of absolute rule.\n\nThe **Manx** parliament has a similar history as well. The Tynwald's origins are shrouded in mystery, with its first records not existing until [1417, but like its other Viking brethren it waned in power, becoming effectively a supreme court, and met only sporadically after 1651. A modern Manx parliament did not exist until 1866, when the first elections were held.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tynwald)\n\nAs for the others:\n\n**Iroquois** - Obtained their modern structure in 1722 but likely existed in some form going back to the 1600s. [The level of centralization is debatable,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois#Government) [although women did have suffrage.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois#Government)\n\n**San Marino** - Traditionally was governed by heads of leading families and degenerated into an oligarchy by the [1700s](http://www.britannica.com/place/San-Marino-republic-Europe/History). Has been compared to other Italian city-states that were later absorbed by Sardinia to form the Kingdom of Italy.\n\n**Switzerland** - While the federation as a whole is quite old, its continuity is not as the current Switzerland, like so many continental European states, is largely a [Napoleonic creation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetic_Republic) Switzerland as a modern, federal, liberal democratic nation-state only dates to [1848.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland_as_a_federal_state)\n\n**Finland** - The definition of Finland as the world's oldest democracy hinges on its racially- and gender-neutral voting law of 1906. Finland, however, was not a fully independent country until [1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland); at the time it was an autonomous territory of Russia.\n\n[Bonus: a list of suggestions from the Guardian's mailbox that includes the usual suspects as well as the UK (apportionment was rather shady up until the 1830s, effectively disenfranchising the urban working class), the USA (slavery, the two-party system, and Bush v. Gore, plus the whole it's a *republic*, not a democracy meme), and some bad matriarchy history.](http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-80426,00.html)\n\nTL;DR: The idea of naming a \"First Democracy\" is an exercise in futility, owing to the differing levels of democracy and sovereignty in the pre-WWII time period.",

That is Ancient Aliens on the [Nazis]( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1b6zcc_ancient-aliens-aliens-and-the-third-reich-alien-ufo-paranormal-documentary_tv). Come along for insanity and much bad history.\n \n\n&gt;0:06 Describes the Nazi armies as having “almost invincible power”, \n\nHigh praise for an army that was utterly crushed.\n \n\n&gt;0:35 Did Hilter base his plans on “extra-terrestrial knowledge?” \n\nNo explanation necessary.\n \n\n&gt;1:56 “Germany possessed the most Technologically advanced military.”\n\nIncorrect, the Nazis were inferior in terms of radar for which the British had the lead on and the atomic bomb which was built by, you guessed it, America. They then go on to mention the jet engine, which was a British idea built [roughly simultaneously]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft) by all major powers in WWII. The British and the Germans started production of jet engines around the same time with the Germans starting mass production of Messerschmitt Me 262 in late 1944 around the time of the British Gloster Meteor was being utilized against the V1 rockets.\n\n&gt;2:54: “The V-2 was years ahead of any other Rocket program”\n\nThis is true, but it also cost 3x as much as the Manhattan Project, caused a couple thousand casualties and had a shockingly bad failure rate due to the inaccuracy, lack of airburst and frankly rather short range. Compared to everyone else, the V-2 was ahead of everyone else. Only Nazi Germany developed a short range tactical ballistic missile. What the show neglects to mention is that as good as the rocketry was, it killed 2,700 or so civilians and injured about 6,000. So a total of 8,000 casualties. Given the fact that each Missile cost a large amount of money, and that about 3,100 were fired the ratio of effectiveness at best was marginal. This is even more notable when the reported cost was approximately 55,000-100,000 RM. Given that there were about 5,000-5,500 made, the manufacturing cost alone ran a hefty sum 250,000,000-500,000,000RM. In other words, the amount of money that was poured into the 3,100 or so fired would’ve ran about 150,000,000 to 300,000,000 depending on the cost figures. At about 100,000 per Panther I that would’ve been quite a few extra tanks. Not to mention that the ethanol fuel it used required quite a few potatoes and food was rather scarce. \n\nAs a rocket it was advanced, as a military weapon the V-2 was honestly terrible.\n \n&gt;3:04 “Around the end of the war they were developing the A10 which was also known as the New York Rocket, so that give you an idea of what they were thinking.”\n\n Just because it’s called New York does not mean it could reach New York. Also, this rocket was many years from production.\n\n&gt;3:10 “They had some pretty grandiose plans”\n\nAmen there brotha.\n\n&gt; 3:20 “German Scientists were the envy of the world.”\n\n*Looks at Manhattan Project* Well I suppose to anyone who didn’t believe in the inferior *Jewish Physics*. \n\n&gt;3:24 “But what was the source of their incredible achievements?”\n\nMeth, lots and lots of meth. Hopes and dreams, an incredibly delusional and deadly detachment from reality and a partridge in a pear tree.\n\n&gt;3:32 “Did they receive more funding and resources for their research?”\n\nGiven that the Nazis failed at making an atomic bomb, had a V-2 rocket program of dubious utility that cost three times as much as the Manhattan Project with far more opportunities for testing and somehow managed to “research” themselves into the Tiger II and the Maus being exemplary ideas of armored warfare I’m going to go with...no.\n\nThis is even more hilarious when one considers how much more impressive the Manhattan Project was. At 1/3rd of the price US scientists created a  *fission bomb*. \n\n&gt;3:43 “Or were they guided by other Extra-terristrial forces?”\n\nConfirmed, Hitler is in fact a space lizard.\n\n&gt;3:54 “Hitler was always saying that he had access to the most advanced technology of the Nazis and that they would prevail in WWII.”\n\nHitler also somehow thought invading Poland in 1939 would piss no one off, and Nazi Germany didn’t prevail in the war. Given that his most advanced wonder weapons tended to blow up or simply not work at all, I’ll say that Hitler said a lot of things.\n\n[Gerp.](https://youtu.be/Zo3aRSp37Xs?t=30s) \n\n&gt;4:10 “What gave Hitler the confidence to assert to masses of people he was going to take over the world?”\n\nPure unadulterated uncut 100% Colombian delusion.\n\n\n&gt;9:09 “According to early Sanskrit texts discovered in India, aircraft called Vimāna used a similar propulsion system thousands of years ago. Is it true that German scantiest view early texts like the Bhagavad Gita, not as legendary myth but as the source of historical and scientific fact.\n \nLet’s talk a bit about Nazis and Sanskrit, Sanskrit is an ancient Indian language that belongs to the Indo-European family of languages that includes languages stretching from Europe to Northern India including German and Sanskrit. One early name that was used for this group of languages is Aryan which is based on the Sanskrit word for noble. In the early 1800’s Friedrich Schlegel hypothesizes that this group of languages was of Indian origin from a “brilliant nation of priests and warriors lived quietly in the secret, hidden valleys of the Himalayas” who later spread out across Eurasia all the way to Germany founding great empires in the process., these people were called the Aryans. A later scholar, Theodor Benfey argued similarly that all of the Aryans were from a similar background but that but that they emerged from Germany instead. While his evidence was weak, German nationalists were more than happy to adopt this view of their ancestors as the creators of most great civilizations. They soon adopted the view that the Aryans shared various physical characteristics including blond hair and blue eyes that became the hallmarks of Nazi racial theory (gibberish). So to address the original idea mentioned in A.A. the Nazis did take ancient Sanskrit seriously as part of the basis for forming their racial theory. Ancients Aliens is actually somewhat right, surprisingly.   For details and the source of the above quotes take a look at Heather Pringle’s “The Master Plan: Himmler’s Scholars and the Holocaust”.\n \n&gt;9:47 Blah Blah Blah, Ancient Indian flying saucers.\n \nQuite Interesting in 1934 there was a rotating hovering craft created by Sikorsky in America. I think there were [Airbenders]( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/21/20/09/212009625b168b3a99a70dcea9811867.jpg) as well in anchient India.\n\n&gt;11:23 That gave them the advanced technology that they developed at the end of the war.\n\nSo advanced the Me-163 blew up constantly, the He-162 that wasn’t ever really made, tanks which weighed more than small petting zoos, ships that were enormous and useless, [GIANT CANNONS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerer_Gustav), heavy bombers that never materialized, a jet bomber that was surprisingly useful as a recon plane, what seems to be a [Flying dorito chip made of wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horten_Ho_229), [This James Bond-esque theoretical weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_gun), and plenty of other advance technology. \n\nI’d feel like a fool being taken advantage of if aliens told me to build this shit. This theory actually works if you assume that said aliens had no idea how humanity or wars worked and that reverse engineering them helped sabotage the Nazis.\n \n&gt;12:38 You find swastikas all over the world, clearly its has to do with aliens.\n \nOr maybe it’s a simple geometric figure, its not like the square, circle or triangle is unique to any one culture.\n \n&gt;13:45 “The swastika is a power Alien-given symbol that could ward off enemies . .  and give the power to become supreme”\n \n[WTF]( http://media.giphy.com/media/ECQJxk7RiMK6k/giphy.gif)\n \n&gt;14:14”Hitler was obsessed with ancient mythology and the occult.”\n \nThe relationship between Hitler and Ancient history is more complicated then this. In 1935, Himmler formed the Ahnenerbe a research institute dedicated “to promote the science of ancient intellectual history ”. Hitler’s reaction to this effort to explore “Aryan” history and science was not always positive. In 1936 Hitler complained about Himmler’s interest in German pre-history stating\n \n&gt; “Why do we call the whole world’s attention to the fact that we have no past? Its bad enough that that the romans were erecting great buildings when our forefathers were still living in mud huts; now Himmler is starting to dig up these villages of mud huts and enthusing over every potshard and stone axe he finds.”\n \nThat is from Pringle as well and it illustrates Hitler’s initial dislike of efforts to uncover ancient history even when used as Nazi propaganda. In 1937 Hitler personally called out the head of the Ahnenerbe at the annual Nuremberg rally, similar to the American state of the union speech, calling him slightly crazy for his theories related to Atlantis.\n \nA later effort by the Ahnenerbe in Tibet however interested Hitler who arranged for a personal lecture on the subject. In summary, Hitler cannot be described as obsessed with Ancient mythology when he actively criticized party members who studied ancient mythology.\n \n&gt; 14:32 Hitler spent an inordinate amount of time in money on the above research.\n \nMany of the Nazi leaders conducting this type of research had to use alternate funding methods, Himmler raised donations, took loans from banks that were never intended to be repaid and shook down companies to fund research efforts.\n \n&gt;14:44 A secret society the Viril . . .\n \nTo quote Wikipedia [“There is no such evidence for such a society.]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vril).\n \n&gt;15:55 [Viril power]( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mblpf8I2hJ1r4yo8m.gif)\n \n&gt;16:25 ‘They believed that they were descended from aliens and were a master\n \nIncorrect, as established above the Nazi’s believed they were a human master race from Northern Germany, which is somehow saner than the show.\n \n&gt;17:09 Also Thor’s Hammer which some believed was an ancient German electric weapons that could destroy all electrical machinery.\n \n&gt;17:25 [Like this]( https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljeeq4MLqA1qi9q4ko1_500.gif)\n\n&gt;18:05 “Secret libraries, hidden documents, while they’re fiction, they’re very much based on truth.” \n\nAt the very least provide some sort of evidence, this isn’t that scene from The Boondocks where Samuel L. Talks about absence of evidence not being evidence of absence.\n \n &gt;18:10 “The Nazis were obsessed with finding the Ark of the Covenant”\n\nPerhaps much to Goering’s dismay, the Ark couldn’t dive bomb the enemies. Perhaps they used Indiana Jones as a source, but the Nazis were less obsessed with finding the Ark and more obsessed in the end with industrialized murder camps. On the bright side, this does mean that if they spent more energy on the Ark, they would’ve lost even quicker.\n\n&gt;18:27 “The Ark of the Covenant had a function, whatever it might have been.”\n\nThis is just lazy. If it’s so powerful, wouldn’t it have been noticed? Does it grant extra research points?\n\n&gt;19:40 “These women kept their hair very long as they believed that their long hair could harness the Virill energy”\n\nThis is not only /r/badscience, but also one of the most far fetched explanations for having really long hair.\n\n&gt;20:10 “They believed that a disc shaped craft could fly through some sort of anti-gravity, some sort of levitation.”\n\nThis is a derivative point, but there is such thing as a flying saucer. It just happened to be the logical extreme of making enormous wings. Ala the [Vought V-173](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought_V-173)\n\n&gt;20:30 “If Germans developed technology so far in advance of Allied technology”\n\nShame they didn’t(not).\n\n&gt;21:00 “Just how close did Hitler come to building the deadliest weapon in the history of the world?”\n\n*Looks at Manhattan Project again* I’d say about $2 billion in 1940s money.\n\n&gt;22:31 “How were the German scientists in Berlin able to make this discovery before anyone else”\n\nI want to say based off of Fermi’s experiments. That said this neglects to mention that Lise Meitner was also a part of their discovery who had to forcibly leave because she was a Jew. Also discovering fission was one thing, the other was weaponizing it. Of which Otto Frisch (another German scientists who left Germany in 1933) helped theorize. It would also be Frisch who would confirm fission. It’s like the discovery needed to be checked and confirmed and that science is a peer reviewed thing.\n\n&gt;~24:00 “”Suggestions of Sodom and Gomorroah having been destroyed by an atomic bomb”\n\nI’m...Okay….*Okaaay.* Taking some of these things literally might not be in your interest.\n\n&gt;24:30 “Hindu Gods having blue skin...could be describing extraterrestrials”\n\nAs opposed to those ancient paintings having stylized depictions which may differentiate between humans and gods? then again this is AA and green egyptian skin is also aliens. \n\n&gt;25:30 “These ancient Jinn with their technology and ancient aircraft (flying carpets) must’ve been ancient aliens.”\n\nOr you know, myths. I mean there’s a pretty big difference between a “ball lightning flying saucer” a Supermarine Spitfire Mk IIa and a flying carpet.\n\n&gt;26:01 “Did Hitler and the Nazis uncover ancient atomic secrets?”\n\nI’m going to say no, but this show insists otherwise.\n\n&gt;26:13 “In developing an ultimate weapon, and how much of it was guided by an outside hand?”\n\nA really shitty hand given that weaponizing the atom bomb was a failure for Germany.\n\n&gt;27:30-27:47 “The Germans were close to creating a nuclear weapon, thank god we beat them to the punch or we’d be speaking German right now.”\n\nIgnoring the fact that the Manhattan project was years of work, just *how* would Nazi Germany deliver this weapon? Fat Man weighed 4,670kg and Little Boy weighed 4,400kg. The V-2 missile could carry a payload of about 1000kg. So that puts it out of the question. Given that there were very few production planes that the Germans could modify to actually carry a 4,500kg Atomic bomb (assuming that the packaging was approximately the same) how could Germany use the weapon since Air superiority was lost by 1943? Even if they could deliver it, Germany was losing by 1943, which means that even if they had an atomic bomb, it wouldn’t be able to turn the tide of war since Germany was running out of manpower and food by 1944. So one asks, how could Germany win? Perhaps an armistice could be reached, but the conclusion assumes so many impossible things. It wouldn’t even matter that they had an atomic bomb.\n\n&gt;28:04 “A weapon that could allow the Nazi Army to travel through space...and time?”\n\nSo the StG. 44? \n\n&gt;29:23 (Talks about a stone henge-ish structure that is purportedly a cooling tower for a mine) “The Nazi administration would not have devoted so much energy and resources to just a mere coal mine.” (Talks about a secret project called “The Bell” an EM propelled craft.”)\n\nThey’re right, the Nazi Administration were responsible for enormously wasteful projects like the Schwerer Gustav Artillery, the Maus, the V-2 Missile. An electromagnetically propelled craft probably had a blueprint somewhere along with the sun gun filed under “stuff our incredibly wasteful regime probably shouldn’t build despite our already wasteful experiments.”\n\n&gt;30:16 “The Wunderwaffe was a weapon so powerful that even at the last minutes of the war….could’ve changed the whole course of the war.”\n\nAnd was also a hilariously desperate propaganda campaign that involved ludicrous things already mentioned. The Wunderwaffe moniker was even coined by the goddamned Nazi propaganda ministry. I mean glorious-Krupp-Stahl at least try to do some research!\n\nAmong said Wunderwaffes was a “curved” rifle that could fire around corners. Seriously, the conversations that went about when it was being developed in secret must’ve resembled the dialogue in Skyrim. “Hans, they have *curved* rifles. *CURVED*.”\n\n&gt;30:30-31:30 “The bell’s design appears contrary to modern aerodynamic principles.”\n\nPoint of clarification, this hypothetical bell would rely on a magic levitation device powered by electromagnetism and have the aerodynamic efficiency of Elton John. To say that it could achieve any significant amount of speed would be myth. To say it could be capable of sustained flight would make aerodynamicists weep. Even the physicist they interviewed from UCI said: “When you start moving you’ll start running into trouble.” \n&gt;31:22 “The Bell may have also been a time machine”\n\nDa fuck? Okay I give up. The rest can be done by /u/A_crazy_canadian.\n\n/u/A_crazy_canadian is equally fed up with this shit.",

This sort of goes hand in hand with bad native history where we assume that African/American cultures were somehow inferior to ours and that the problems faced by these societies now are in spite of our best efforts to modernize them. This is basically victim blaming and is seriously hindering to efforts to try and fix the situations that imperialist powers put these societies into. \n\n\n\nAnyway, what takes the cake in your mind for some of the most poisonous forms of badhistory?",

In looking up information about Schubert and generally having a good time reading about him, I came across [this article](http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/334391,the-10-greatest-gay-composers-mardi-gras-special.aspx) from Limelight Magazine about the ten greatest gay composers as well as the work of [Susan McClary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_McClary#.22Constructions_of_Subjectivity_in_Franz_Schubert.27s_Music.22) and her assertions that we can know Schubert was gay because of the \"hedonistic\" nature of the Unfinished Symphony. There are a few problems with the list (and problems with McClary's ideas), but the biggest one is simply that there is no evidence that some of the composers listed were actually gay. \n\nI also admit that this post is a bit of an extension on the last post I did about [Anna Magdalena Bach](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/36llip/anna_magdelena_bach_secret_composer) and the tendency to re-label rather reclaim. I promise, though, this won't be a rehash of the same ideas, nor will it be a nitpicking of the evidence of Schubert or Handel or any of the eleven composers on the list being gay. I mean, I want to talk about Schubert because I didn't do all this reading for nothing, but I think the interesting thing here isn't Schubert. The more interesting question is one of identifying a historical figure's sexuality, and if you do decide that's something you want to do, how you do it. \n\nBut let's talk about Schubert because I want to talk about Schubert and you can't stop me.\n\nFranz Schubert was an early 19th century Viennese composer. He taught music at his father's school while taking composition lessons from Salieri. During his time as a teacher, he composed many of the pieces he is now best known for, especially his *lieders,* pieces that could be played on the piano while someone's daughter screeches in an off-key way in the background. These were immensely popular, and while they didn't necessarily give him enough money to live on, by 1818, he was winning some acclaim for his pieces. By 1820, he had a close group of friends with whom he would compose, perform, and get into shenanigans (the group was arrested and given a stern talking to/banishment by the Austrian police). Essentially, if you ever want the stereotypical starving Bohemian artist, Schubert in the late 1810s, early 1820s is it. By the mid 1820s, Schubert was doing better, publishing pieces more rapidly and living in less abject poverty. However, even as his music became more popular and sophisticated, his health declined, and in 1828, Schubert died. There is heavy debate about how Schubert died, and it's completely relevant to the question of Schubert's sexuality.\n\nYou see, there was something I left out of my summary of Schubert's life, something dreadfully relevant to the subject of this post. Schubert never married, though it wasn't for lack of trying. In 1814, while still teaching at his father's school, Schubert met Therese Grob, a local soprano and the daughter of a silk merchant. Over the next three years, he wrote pieces for her, dedicating them to her, and had her sing in the premiere of his Mass No. 2. When asked about her later in life, Schubert would say:\n\n&gt; \"I loved someone very dearly and she loved me too … . For three years she hoped I would marry her; but I could not find a position which would have provided for us both.\"\n\nHe didn't marry her, though not through lack of desire, but rather because the law prevented it. Because he was of a lower class than she, he couldn't legally marry her unless he could demonstrate he had the financial capabilities to take care of her, which he couldn't. Instead, she married someone else, and Schubert stayed single. \n\nThis wouldn't be the last time Schubert would fall in love, though once again, the exact specificities are debated. In 1824, he dedicated his Fantasy in F Minor duet to Countess Karoline Eszterházy which wouldn't be enough on its own to say he had an unrequited love affair, except that his friend Eduard von Bauernfeld wrote a poem heavily implying that he did:\n\n&gt; In love with a Countess of youthful grace,\n—A pupil of Galt's; in desperate case\nYoung Schubert surrenders himself to another,\nAnd fain would avoid such affectionate pother\n\nThe stuff of rumours indeed. Speaking of rumours, I promised I'd talk about Schubert's death. There are several theories about Schubert's death, and which ones you believe have a huge impact on how you interpret what his friends wrote about him. Take, for instance, the line from his friend, Josef Kenner:\n\n&gt; Anyone who knew Schubert knows that he has two natures foreign to each other and how powerfully the craving for pleasure dragged his soul down to the slough of moral degradation\n\nGiven the context I've provided so far - and given the context that he's on the list of gay composers, you might assume that this is a reference to that homosexuality and that \"slough of moral degradation\" involved gay sex. Hold that thought - it's important, I swear.\n\nThere are two prevailing theories for how Schubert died. The first is that he, like many other people, died of typhoid fever. There are a few bits of evidence supporting this. The first is that he first became visibly ill on 31 October, 1828, had to be restrained as he became delirious on 11 November, and died of what was then diagnosed as \"nerve fever\" on 19 November. If that had been the first time he'd been sick, that might be believable. The trouble is, though, that the symptoms that his friends described don't match typhoid fever, especially not for how long they'd been going on. In 1823, he first consulted a doctor for \"giddiness,\" among other things. We don't know what he was prescribed, but some of the symptoms he showed when he finally died were consistent with mercury poisoning, implying that he died of syphilis. \n\nAha. Syphilis. An STD. There is a lot of evidence that he died of advanced syphilis, and personally, it's the interpretation I subscribe to. When one considers the idea that Schubert died of syphilis, that quote about \"the slough of moral degradation\" changes a bit. It could be that Schubert was gay, and that that's referring to homosexuality. Or it could be that Schubert really loved prostitutes. They're both possible, and even more problematically, they're both potentially supported by the documents we have.\n\nAnd here's where we get to the crux of it: We can't go ask Schubert \"Yo, are you gay?\" If nothing else, he was Austrian and didn't speak English, but beyond that, he's dead and unlikely to say one way or the other. Instead, we have to rely on what we have, even when it's contradictory or open to being over-interpreted. \n\nOn the one hand, we do have the documentation from his journals, from his dedications, and from his friends that he fell in love with at least one woman and probably had an unrequited love affair with another. On the other hand, some of his companions were gay, and he enjoyed turning pieces into [homoerotic *lieder*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymed_%28Goethe%29). There's also an entire body of literature dedicated to interpreting and reinterpreting his pieces with an LGBT lens. Pieces like [Fantasy for four hands in F Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0umOJhlVRYE) get examined as to whether or not having four hands on the piano in the first place is an expression of the gay oeuvre. Was he gay? Wasn't he gay? Is the \"Fantasy\" gay? What about the \"Unfinished Symphony,\" with its \"resistance to compulsion\" and \"unorthodoxy?\" Can homosexuality be seen in music? Can music have a \"homosexual character?\"\n\nAs I said, this isn't a post about whether or not Schubert was gay. As I said, I read McClary and Solomon (I didn't mention him earlier - oops) along with other musicologists. I am not a musicologist. I freely admit that I haven't the faintest idea what makes Schubert's Fantasy any more an expression of a homosexual identity than Beethoven's Fifth. What I look at, though, is the Limelight article and its claiming of composers as gay, regardless of whether or not they were. If there is a hint that they could be, suddenly they are, regardless of the debate or the reality of it. I'm all for reclaiming and celebrating the works of LGBT composers, but, as with Anna Magdalena, claiming without fact isn't the way to go. \n\nThat said, perhaps looking at Schubert's music in conjunction with what we know *will* reveal something about him. As it currently stands, I can't help but feel that the interpretations lean too heavily on gay stereotypes to be accurate, and that readings from journals and writings tend to favour whatever interpretation you're looking for in them. What I think needs to be taken to heart with Schubert and the other \"we're not sure\" composers on the list is that, great as it is to have more LGBT people in the canon of history, let's not claim it optimistically or rashly or by relying on stereotypes and half-truths to get there. \n\nSources!\n\n- \"Piano Four-Hands: Schubert and the Performance of Gay Male Desire\" by Phillip Brett, which is in many ways a reaction to McClary and Solomon. What I find interesting is how he points out that there are no LGBT musicologists weighing in on the question of Schubert's sexuality and whether music can demonstrate that sexuality. Once again, though, I am not a musicologist, and perhaps it's not necessary to have an LGBT perspective in order to see a certain perspective in a piece of artwork. Certainly people who are not part of a given population can still engage in criticism from that perspective (much as there are male feminist scholars). \n\n- \"Franz Schubert and the Peacocks of Benvenuto Cellini\" by Maynard Solomon, the piece that basically ignited the debate about Schubert's sexuality. There's a particular quote from Bauernfeld that says:\n\n&gt; Schubert is out of sorts—he needs ‘young peacocks,’ like Benvenuto Cellini\n\nwhich Solomon interprets as meaning that Schubert was gay, largely because Cellini was gay. This piece has been so debated and so responded to that it's basically the place to start for anyone wanting to learn more about the debate about Schubert's sexuality. \n\n- [Franzschubert.com](http://www.franzpeterschubert.com/index.html) is totes an academic site.\n\n- \"Constructions of Subjectivity in Franz Schubert's Music\" by Susan McClary, where she expands on Solomon's ideas about finding Schubert's sexuality through his music (something which she admits is essentialist, but says can still be done, albeit with an eye for the intentionality in his music. There's a lot to criticise - not the least of which is the methodology, which relies on comparisons to 20th century gay literature - but there's also some good points that she makes. I disagree with her (especially since she claims that Schubert and his music are \"effeminate,\" as if that states something about what homosexuality ought to look like in a piece of music), but me disagreeing doesn't invalidate her paper.",

Clearly, I didn't have much to do at work today. This is what I found: \n\nOn December 21st, 1944 at 5 pm, 6 Tigers of 506th Heavy Panzer Battalion attacked the 7th Armored Division near St. Vith in the Ardennes. The Tigers started with Star Shells and followed up with armor piercing, destroying all of the defending American vehicles, including tanks. [1]\n\nAlso during the Battle of St. Vith, an M8 Greyhound of Troop B, 87th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron destroyed a Tiger I tank. [2]\n\nStaff Sargent Lesniak encountered a Tiger in Nouville during the Battle of the Bulge. He quickly fired 3 75mm rounds that apparently did nothing, but the Tiger crew retreated, backing over a jeep and became disabled. The tankers destroyed the Tiger with thermite. [3]\n\nOn December 19th 1944, Donald Nichols engaged a Tiger at 600 yards with his 105mm Sherman, resulting in a confirmed kill. He was later engaged by a second Tiger, and retreated. He knew it was a Tiger from the distinctive sound that the 88 mm shells made [4]\n\nAlso on the 19th, two Tigers were engaged by a Sherman, a 57 mm gun, and infantry with bazookas. The Tigers were thoroughly destroyed. [4]\n\nA Tank Destroyer engaged a Tiger near Foy. The Tiger was not destroyed, but it was driven off. [4]\n\nOn December 21st, 1944 an M16 engaged a Tiger with its .50s, and forced it to retreat. [4]\n\nOn December 24th, Lt. Brunson and his crew engaged a Tiger II at 30 yards and destroyed it. I believe he was in Sherman, but possibly a lighter tank as well. [4]\n\nOn Jan. 12th, three Shermans in support of an assault by the 101st Airborne engaged a Tiger. The Tiger destroyed one US tank. [4] \n\nA Tiger knocked out a Pershing in an ambush at Elsdorf, as he mentioned, and this Tiger was abandoned by it's crew shortly after when it was stranded on some debris. [5] Shortly after that engagement though, another Tiger was destroyed by another M26 90-mm HVAP T30E16 ammunition at 900 yds. [6]\n\nAnother M26 destroyed a Tiger in Cologne, [7] and there was a report of a Tiger being killed by the lone Super Pershing, but it's questionable. [6]\n\nSo there you go. That's a large number of encounters between Tigers and American tankers, and these were only really during the Battle of the Bulge and after. Moran does make the point that \"everything was a Tiger\" to American tankers. This makes sense, as it's very hard to find out what actually happened during a battle. But in many of the above incidents, the enemy tanks were very close to multiple witnesses, and often times the remains of the tank were still there for all to see. \n\nYou could also say Moran is also referring to Tiger Is, and yes, my sources were not always clear as to whether or not the tank in question is a Tiger I or II. That's a fair point. But, if Zalooga is indeed correct in saying that only 3 Tiger Is were encountered, it's still like saying that only a few BF-109G-2s were encountered in 1944. They were being phased out, or they had already broken down or been bombed, and by the time the Bulge came around, the Tiger II had stepped up and taken it's place. \n\nRobinofFoxley, if you end up over here, you'll see that I've pretty much copy/pasted what I responded to you. Also, my response is really more to Moran.

Pappas states that from a historical perspective, the Ahmadi identification of Yuzasaf with Jesus relies on legends and documents which include clear historical errors (e.g., Gondophares' reign) and that \"it is almost impossible to identify Yuz Asaf with Jesus\".\n\n\nNote:To Muslims browsing this subreddit,please do not use religious slurs like 'Quadiani' against the Ahmadis in the comments section here.\n",

In fact it was him speaking that it was not harsh enough; and he is totally right. The treaty was harsh enough to build resentment but not harsh enough to actually stop Part 2 Electric Boogaloo from happening.\n\nAnyways let's comb through this shit. Just preemptively I want to link [this wonderful R5 in the thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/395faw/til_that_after_the_treaty_of_versailles_marshal/cs0lmeu) which dispels a lot of bullshit so I don't have to put in effort.\n\n&gt; [WW2 is kinda like WW1 continued.](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/395faw/til_that_after_the_treaty_of_versailles_marshal/cs0kpsd)\n\n-\n\n&gt; WWII was simply WWI after the intermission. It was the same damn war, only with a 20 year commercial break.\n\nExcept for totally different power blocs, totally different governments, totally different beginnings of the war, totally different reasons people are fighting, totally different conditions the war was being fought in...oh and that little thing where *literally half* of Germany's former allies *did not exist anymore* and that both of her main allies *were on the Entente side in WWI.*\n\n&gt; [The treaty was overly harsh on Germany. The reparations were ridiculously high, something like 33 billion dollars. Plus the excess land loss, especially the Polish corridor, was just asking for a retaliation.](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/395faw/til_that_after_the_treaty_of_versailles_marshal/cs0hd4a)\n\nThe classic line \"start shit get hit\" comes to mind. I'm sorry but just from a moral standpoint, to step aside for a second, I lack any sympathy for a country who deliberately begins a war by invading a neutral power and another power who was making no intent to get involved, occupies them for 4 years, institutes draconian peace on the ally of those they invaded (Brest-Litovsk), and then whines that they have to pay reparations when they eventually lose. None. Zero. Zip. Don't start a fucking war and then whine when you have to pay for the damages.\n\nRegardless Germany made absolutely no good faith attempt to pay the reparations, instead letting Rudolf Havenstein deliberately trash the economy to get out of them. Which is what happened. And then the Germany economy fucking crashed expectedly. And here we are 100 years later talking about how history is written by the victors while spouting '20's German propaganda.\n\nGermany left the war with her industry in tact (unlike the French who had their most industrious region occupied and destroyed by war) and the highest GDP in Europe. \n\n&gt; Shows how history is written by the victors. When reading up on the Treaty of Versailles, you realize how WW2 could have been avoided. Gen MacArthur was able to learn from that and help Japan correctly transition.\n\nLiterally textbooks talk about how Versailles was evil punitive France punishing poor innocent Germany and it was France who caused WWII. Literally any discussion ever about this, *ever*, has everyone going on about how Versailles caused WWII directly and how we should have listened to Wilson. This is history written by the losers and one of the best cases of it, it wasn't until the 1960's after we got all those documents the Germans kept secret that we realized, hey, it was kind of their fault mostly.\n\n&gt; Treaty of Versailles set up the perfect opportunity for US. bankers: Put the Germans so in debt that their economy would collapse and that they would need to borrow from the U.S. to repay debts to France, and Britain, so that France and G.B. could repay its war debt to the U.S.\n\nI'm sensing /r/conspiracy DA JOOS here but I'll let it slide.\n\n&gt; And that's why WWI and WWII are occasionally refereed to as the Second 30 Years War by scholars.\n\nLiterally zero scholars say this seriously.\n\n&gt; It's interesting that basically, after this, the French started building the Maginot line. They were not only preparing for another war soon, they were so absolutely sure it would be with Germany that they sunk their entire budget into turning their border into a fortress.\n\n&gt; Uselessly, it would prove, in the end, but this shows how prevalent this belief was. Foch wasn't alone, most high ranking military officials in France, Germany and the UK knew that Versailles only bought Europe some time.\n\nThe maginot line was built over a decade after Versailles... \n\n&gt; The Treaty of Versailles was a disgusting piece of documentation. Anyone and their mother could tell its main goal was to punish and take revenge on Germany, Not make war a thing of the past. It was so infuriating to the Americans and Japanese Diplomats.\n\n&gt; The Japanese walked out of the talks 10 days after it started, changing the big 5 to the Big 4, an ominous sign to begin with and only agreed to sign it after ridiculously favorable conditions were given to them. Japanese Emperor Taishō, Even wrote letters to British PM, David Lloyd George and French PM,Clemenceau. But to no avail.\n\n&gt; The Americans never ratified the treaty, as they saw it as an absurd treaty, instead signing the U.S.–German Peace Treaty and The Treaty of Washington.\n\n&gt; The Treaty of Versailles was one of the worst documents ever written and once it was signed Europe doomed itself to another war.\n\nOh my god the tears are just overflowing at this point. Japan walked out because they kept demanding annexations from China and Europe told them to fuck off they barely did anything plus China was their ally. They literally wanted China as their substate *de facto* and threw a temper tantrum when it wasn't given to them. This guy's making their leaving the conference as some giant moral protest against punitive terms LMFAO.\n\nVersailles left Germany the strongest continental power. Default. End of story. Austria-Hungary was absolutely tattered, Russia lost basically all of its Western lands (it would take a good amount back in the coming years but that's later) and was in revolutionary shambles, France had no industry and lost a lot of young men.\n\nEurope doomed itself to war when the Allies made absolutely zero effort to actually enforce Versailles. They didn't enforce the 100,000 soldier cap. They didn't enforce reparations. They didn't enforce border treaties. They didn't enforce jack shit because they felt peace beget more peace. Versailles was punitive enough to build resentment but not enforced in any respect / not punitive enough to actually stop them from coming back.\n\nI'll just copy paste my exchange with this kind fellow below:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The Treaty of Versailles was literally a ceasefire. It also bankrupted Germany and Italy beyond comprehension. Not to take away from the Marshall, but I think 'No Shit' could apply to that one.\n\n&gt;&gt; It \"literally\" wasn't.\n\n&gt;&gt; Germany bankrupted herself with horrible wartime policies. They took 9 war loans while Britain 3 and France 4. By the armistice 90% of their budget was paying interest on loans.\n\n&gt;&gt; Then afterward Rudolf Havenstein deliberately sabotaged the economy to get reparations reduced, which is just what happened.\n\n&gt;&gt; Source: Sally Marks and Adam Tooze's wonderful works.\n\n&gt; It 'literally' was, cunt. The shame of the huge amount in reparations owed to the Allies was one of the tools Hitler used to rally the German people in WW2.\n\nWell, as I said in my reply to him, no. Just fucking no.\n\n&gt; Did people really think it was a peace treaty? From what I've read people thought it was just an armistice.\n\nKill me.\n\n&gt; Yes, the Territorial concessions were the least among the Central powers, of course that's because both the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian empire were completely demolished into literal non-existence. With the complete destruction of both empires.\n\n&gt; The Versailles Treaty had some of the most ridiculous clauses in it to ensure a neutered Germany. Article 231 blamed Germany for the whole war, causing great resentment. The impossible war debt requirement meant Germany could not pay its debts and would go into hyperinflation, which it did, The whole treaty was designed to create a unstable and fractured Germany. In that front it was an utter Success, Germany become an unstable state, and with that came the rise of an unstable actor who could not be challenged by the weak German government set up by the Versailles treaty.\n\n&gt; Europe brought the Second world war upon itself with the signing of this ridiculous peace of paper. So many more died, just so Europe could get sate its thirst for vengeance.\n\nCan I just link my AH post on this?

While the U.S. is still bragging about victory over Germany it was actually beaten by the Soviets. Operation Overlord and the battle of Normandy was just a diversion from the much more massive Soviet Operation Bagration which broke the back of the Wehrmacht.]\n\nWhile the majority of the German army was defeated by the Soviets, it would be folly to believe the United States didn't help out. [The US gave approximately 11 billion dollars worth of goods to the Soviet Union.\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease#US_deliveries_to_the_USSR)\n\n[And after World War II I do not see any war the U.S. has really won. And no, Grenada does not count. The Korea War ended in a stalemate at the 38th parallel north, just where it had started. The Vietnam War certainly wasn't a victory. While the 1991 war against Iraq put the Kuwaiti Emir back into power, it did not beat Saddam into submission. The 2003 war against Iraq will end with a strategic loss when the U.S. is leaving at the end of this year. In Afghanistan the war will also likely end with a U.S. retreat.]\n\n\n[List of Wars involving the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States#20th_century_wars) \n\nEdit: Expanding a bit more and more badhistory.\n\nJust a few wars after World War 2 the US did win.\n\nThe Gulf War\nDominican Civil War\nInvasion of Panama\n\nAlso why does Grenada not count? All the objectives were achieved and and it was well received by the public as far as wars go. \n\n[I, for one, fail to see why the U.S. military and security services continue to enjoy such a privileged position in the United States. Has it escaped the notice of the U.S.'s 300+ million people that since 1945 their proud, pampered army has never actually won a war? Or that it committed horrific war crimes in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan (en route to defeat, naturally)? Or that its support for Mujaheddin against the Soviets endangered the security of every U.S. man, woman and child by risking a massive counterstrike which came on 9/11 and which cost you $3 trillion?]\n\nThe Mujahideen is not the same as Al-Qaeda. Some members of the Mujahideen did go on to join Al-Qaeda but calling them the same thing is incorrect.\n",

To being a constitutional monarchy (with a military dictator at the end but oh well) that was a world power.\n\nNow I have issues with a few things said here. Start with the obvious the idea that having an Emperor is somehow characteristic of being [\"primitive\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/38yeb0/who_won_every_paradox_game_in_real_life/crywb6w). For starters most European powers had a monarchy and even Emperors. I doubt he would characterize the German Empire in such a way. Also on this the Japanese Emperor at this time had very little direct political power hence why it is often named the Edo period after the seat of the Shogun. Even the Shogun's power varied greatly on the individual so their power was more fluid. \n\nNow calling Japan at the time underdeveloped annoyed me quite a bit as Japan was heavily urbanized society (Edo with a population of one million in the 18th century which is more than London at the same time) with a high literacy rate of 50%+ which is higher then a lot of European nations. From a later comment the user characterized the underdevelopment of Edo Japan as a lack of Ocean going vessels (Wrong) and no compasses (wrong). He also mentioned lack of machines, steam and modern military which I suppose is correct but the level their technology was \"behind\" western nations is far less then I imagine the user guesses.\n\nAs for the backwater comments this is most probably the most Eurocentric view of em all. Now Japan was more isolationist then most countries this is true. But the level of the isolation is often over played. The fact is European traders (except the Dutch) were banned from Japan. The key word being European. Japan was still open to the Chinese and other Asian traders.\n\nEdit: To clarify when I say open I mean certain ports were open to them rather than free unrelenting trade.\n\nI suppose to sum up the reason I find this so irksome is that the user here is praising the developments of the Meji restoration ignoring the fact the reason why the developments were possibly at all was that Japan was already a highly developed society. Edo Japan had a highly literate society, with a decent level of urbanization, a sophisticated bureaucracy, a stable fairly unified nation and a developed economy. Hardly a primitive underdeveloped backwater.  ",

At ~6 minutes in, the video contains a very impressive column of red that dwarfs all of the others and represents Soviet casualties on the eastern front.  \n&gt; Many of those loses can be attributed to the professional state of the Wehrmacht and its superior application of tank warfare. But these staggering loses can also be attributed to Josef Stalin, who purged many of his top generals before the war and who had no qualms about throwing a seemingly endless supply of men into the Nazi meat-grinder.\n\nThis is almost entirely false. ~~The Red Army outmatched the Wehrmacht with regard to tank warfare through the entire war. When Operation Barbarossa began, no German tank could match the T-34, and though Wehrmacht armor improved, Soviet tanks remained superior~~. For the most part, the Red Army did not use human wave tactics either (see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2am4oz/did_the_red_army_really_use_humanwave_tactics_in/ciwj95k) /r/AskHistorians post for a more detailed analysis), and while the Soviet Union suffered very heavy losses at the beginning of the war, by 1944 the tide had turned and the Wehrmacht was largely on the defensive, suffering large losses of its own. For example, in the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Red Army suffered 363,000 total casualties (14%) compared to 822,000 Wehrmacht casualties (96%). Looking only at deaths, the Red Army had 20,000 fewer fatalities than the Wehrmacht even though their army was over three times the size. The Red Army still lost many men through the entire war, but it was far from sending millions to only slow the Nazi war machine that the article implies. \n\nGoing into the comments, the bad history worsens.\n&gt;Swarm tactics are definitely an effective plan. Tragically brutal, but sometimes the only choice.     \n\nThat's not wrong yet, but I don't like the way this is going.\n&gt;The effectiveness of swarming was the reason the US chose to build Sherman tanks so lightly. The generals assumed high casualties would be inevitable because of how thin the armor was on Shermans and how comparatively weak its gun was.\n\nAnd it does so spectacularly. Most of you should be familiar with how wrong this is from [the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/38gqva/m4_sherman_common_myths/) the other day, but to reiterate: The M4 Sherman had 76mm sloped frontal armor, and was one the most heavily armored medium tanks of the war, ~~far above the Panzer IV and Tiger and~~ comparable to the T-34 and Panther. For comparison, here is a German tank crew describing an encounter with ~~T-34s~~ KV-2s, which only had 60mm of frontal armor\n\n&gt;Very soon we were facing each other at 50 to 100 yards. A fantastic exchange of fire took place without any visible German success. The Russian tanks continued to advance, and all armour-piercing shells simply bounced off them.\n\nThe M4 could engage a Tiger I from over 1,500 meters, while the Tiger would have to close to under 100 meters to penetrate the Sherman's armor in an ideal situation. In a normal combat scenario, the Tiger I outranged the M4 by nearly a kilometer  \n&gt; If a Sherman meet a German Tiger in a one-on-one fight, the Sherman would lose 10 times out of 10.\n\nI can't thing of anything to say about his other than no. The M4, T-34, Panzer IV and Panther all had very similar armament. The M4, Panzer IV, and Panther had 75mm main guns, and the T-34 had an insignificantly larger 76.2 mm main gun. The Tiger had a larger 88mm gun, ~~but it would still only penetrate the M4's superior armor from very short ranges~~  which was famously lethal to Allied tanks\n\n&gt;However, because the US could build tanks so quickly, it ensured the fights would never be a one-on-one fight, they would be twelve-on-one fight. Even if it took four Shermans to kill one Tiger, there would still be eight more Shermans coming off the line in the US to replace them.\n\nSo? If you were able to produce 10 times as many tanks as the enemy, why wouldn't you? This doesn't say anything about the inferiority of the Sherman, just about the general inferiority of the Axis, especially in 1944-1945 when German industry began to collapse. \n\nSources\n\n* [operationbarbarossa.net](http://www.operationbarbarossa.net/the-t-34-in-wwii-the-legend-vs-the-performance/)\n* Previous /r/badhistory and /r/askhistorians posts\n* Wikipedia\n\nEDIT: In my fervor to correct badhistory, I ended up misinterpreting many of my sources and committing badhistory myself. Everyone should just ignore the second half of the above post and instead read these corrections, which hopefully will be more correct. (Or just read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/38gqva/m4_sherman_common_myths/) post)\n\n* While the T-34 was by far the best tank on the Eastern Front, Soviet tank tactics were not very effective. Many of the trained officers were killed in the Great Purge, and the failure of Soviet tanks in the Spanish Civil War caused the Red Army to scale back development of a mechanized doctrine. Also, Soviet tanks were intended primarily for infantry support and most crews were unprepared for anti-tank warfare. Because of this, the Red Army was overwhelmed by the Wehrmacht's armored attacks. The Red Army lost 20,000 tanks in 1941, and were not able to best the Wehrmacht's armored forces until much later in the war. \n\n* The M4 Sherman had comparable armor to it's German adversaries. The Sherman had 51mm of sloped frontal armor, giving it 93mm of effective armor, comparable to the Tiger I's 100mm unsloped armor. The improved RHP glacis gave the Sherman 118mm of effective armor. The Panther had slightly better 140mm effective armor. However the 8.8cm gun of the Tiger I was very effective against the Sherman. *At a 30 degree angle* the Sherman was nearly impervious to a Tiger I's guns, but under normal conditions a Tiger I would be able to penetrate the turret from 1,800m, and from farther if targeting the Sherman's weak side and rear armor.\n\n* The standard Sherman's 76mm gun was not very effective against the Panther or Tiger I. The Sherman would only be able to penetrate the Tiger's turret armor from 700m. However, as a medium tank, the Sherman was not intended to directly contest heavy tanks like the Tiger, leaving that job to purpose-built tank destroyers. The M36 was able to pierce the Tiger's frontal armor from over 2,000m, and the Sherman Firefly (A modified Sherman equipped with the British 17-lbr gun) was able to from 1,900m.\n\n* Despite seeming inferior on paper, the Allied tank doctrine was very effective against the Wehrmacht armored corps. For example at the [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arracourt), the Panther was completely outmatched by Allied armor. A combined force of M4's, M36's and Fireflies was able to destroy 86 of the 5th Panzer Army's 262 armored vehicles, and damage another 114, leaving only 62 to continue the counterattack. Despite the superior numbers and firepower of the German tanks, the smaller Shermans were able to maneuver better through the close quarters of the battle, while the large size, long barrel, and poor visibility of the Panther made it unable to return fire. In addition, the panzer division had no dedicated reconnaissance, leaving them almost completely blind in the heavy fog and allowing the Shermans to flank them. Many Panthers were also destroyed by American close air support. In total, only 25 allied tanks and seven tank destroyers were lost. The Shermans may have been worse on paper, but combined with the Allies' better combined arms and tank doctrine, were operationally very effective against Panthers and even the heavier Tiger I.",

        "text": "First, I'm not good at English(I learn English as a second language), so be tolerant towards poor grammar and spelling.\n\nToday, I was unfortunately searching about Jesus myth theory, and saw [this](http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.kr/2015/06/for-fourth-time-jesus-fails-to-qualify.html).\n\nIn that blog post, the author says this,\n\n&gt;In conclusion, while Christian apologists may find proof of Jesus as a historical figure in a few Classical authors, the professional Editors and Contributors of this long standing \"Ultimate Reference Work on the Classical World\" would strongly disagree! \n\n...What? I learned that almost every scholar who involved in Bible or history of early Christianity thinks that historical Jesus exists. Did I wrong? Perhaps. So how does the author know I'm wrong? saw this.\n\n&gt;Under Josephus, Flavius, both the 1st (1948)  and 2nd (1969) edition failed to mention any reference to Jesus ( note in 2nd, ed. , p.565), while a three page article on Jews (pp. 563- 565) also fails to reference either Jesus or the New Testament.\n\n\n&gt;The 3rd. ed. continues the title:  The Oxford Classical Dictionary: The Ultimate Reference Work on the Classical World includes more than 6,200 entries, but again fails to provided any entry on Jesus nor has it any use for the New Testament as a historical record.  Although the entry on Josephus is expanded in the newer editions, the Dictionary dismisses the Testimonium Flavianum account on Jesus as reliable history in just one sentence: “The famous testimonium to Jesus is partly or even wholly an interpolation.” (p. 798)\n\nFirst time I saw that, I think it is some sort of joke or something, but the author is very serious. He really think that no entry about Jesus is the proof that historical Jesus isn't accepted by classical scholar. Of course, historical Jesus is questionable because he doesn't have his entry in one book(although that book is a dictionary dedicated for classical study). The consensus of scholar? historical evidence? What a stupid thing to say!\n\nBut, the situation gets better. Some intelligent, evidence-based atheist saw it too, was impressed with it, and linked it to [r/atheism](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/38hsyq/debunking_christianity_for_the_fourth_time_jesus/?sort=new). And Oh, oh my flying spaghetti monster! That thread is the Dionysus festival which is smoked by Jesus Myth marijuana. disrespect to respectable scholars, exaggeration of evidences which supports Jesus Myth theory, and of course, The most great historian, Richard Carrier. Everything I hate about is in there. And unsurprisingly, Everyone who talk about consensus of scholar is killed like King Pentheus. \n\nI know, I know. I'm not a stranger in Reddit and I know that is a typical [r/atheism](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism). but, don't we discuss about this thousand and thousand times?! I'm just a layman who like to read some internet threads and blog posts about history, but I read so many discussion about historical Jesus. It's everywhere. And every time I saw it, Mythicism was at least unpersuasive. Not because I was biased(I'm too historically illiterate to have bias), but their arguments usually had many logical fallacies, denial of facts, and so on. Although not too many to seem persuasive to some so-called skeptics. fucking terrific.\n\nWhoo. Enough rant. Thanks for reading my poorly written post.\n\np.s. Just out of curiosity, How do you think why the Oxford Classical Dictionary does not make entry about Jesus? I think that blog post's assertion is poor, then I have some doubt for why.",

        "text": "As we know from that one /u/NMW post a while back, second opinion bias is when you discover the complexity of a topic and as a result you take the opposite of previously held beliefs as the truth, rather than a complex, nuanced understanding. And with all respects to the Crusades, WWI and Hitler, there is no topic that suffers from this quite as much as the Greco-Persian wars, which formed the cornerstone of the first history produced in Europe and has been a cultural obsession ever since.\n\nThe standard narrative is that the heroic Greeks fought the despotic Persians, and no battle in the wars--in all of Western history!--exemplifies freedom vs. slavery as much as Thermopylae. Or, well, until that old second opinion kicks in. [From this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37kxyh/what_are_some_ugly_facts_about_famous_and/crnt436):\n\n&gt;Xerxes was a much fairer and more progressive ruler than Leonidas. 300 makes it seem like the Spartans were fighting for freedom, but they heavily relied on slaves.\n\nand more\n\n&gt;They relied entirely on slaves for everything but soldiering. That's why every \"Spartan\" was a warrior; because that was the only way to keep all their slaves down.\n\nand more\n\n&gt;Even soldiering! The Spartans themselves fought in the hoplite line, but the Helots (Greek slaves) were levied to fight as light troops and skirmishers.\n\n&gt;In fact, at Thermopylae itself, every Spartan had 4 Helot retainers, all of whom were pushed to the front to slow the Persians down.\n\nand more\n\n&gt;Sparta is one of those things you think is cool when you're in middle school until you grow up and realize that it was a dystopian hellhole.\n\nI'll stop here, as I was literally just posting different posts in sequence, because the next one will require a slightly different topic. Instead, I'll primarily start with the first: was Xerxes a more fair and just ruler than Leonidas?\n\nWell, we don't know. The amount we know about Leonidas can fill a relatively large postage stamp. We can talk about his fairly uneventful succession, and apparently he was an excellent athlete. Beyond that, it basically boils down to \"Spartan king who died at Thermopylae exhibiting considerable personal bravery\". Xerxes we know more about. He was a younger son of the great king Darius, who in many respects created the institutions of the Persian Empire out of the conquests of his \"relatives\" Cyrus and Cambyses. That he was a younger son is significant--although his succession owed some to his mother, the paramount wife, he still was specifically chosen, as Persian succession was not based on primacy (which is part of the reason every succession caused a civil war, invariably followed by rebellion in Egypt). He was a prolific inscriber, and it is from him that we first get the formulation of Ahura Mazda, Mithra and Anahita. Militarily, he was fairly succesful outside of the disaster in Greece, successfully putting down major rebellions in Egypt and Babylon (the latter seemingly brutally, if we can interpret the ending of the Babylonian Temple Records as saying that) and his invasion of Greece, although a failure, was fairly competently conducted. It is hard to think of any major mistakes. He was a competent militarist, as all Persian emperors were (which I will get into later). Primarily, though, his reign was one of a stabilization if borders outside of losses in the Aegean. He was not the great conqueror that his father was, the Hadrian to his Trajan, if you will.\n\nWhich is all a way of saying that we have absolutely no way of knowing how just of a ruler he was, no more than we do Leonidas. In Herodotus, we get an image if a ruler capable of brutality and humanity, which is probably correct because Herodotus is usually correct but we don't really have any way of knowing. I have more or less outlined the sum total of what we know about Xerxes. So the statement is on the face of it wrong, but perhaps what is being compared are Persian and Sparta themselves.\n\nSo, let's go to the Persians. The Persians had a rich and vibrant culture, with an art style that gorgeously synthesized what came before while still adding its own distinctive touch. Seriously, the Apadama reliefs are quite possibly the pinnacle of Near Eastern art. By uniting Persis, Mesoptamia, Egypt, Asia Minor an even the Indus valley they accomplished more than any state had before—and unlike the Assyrians the conquests proved lasting. Bernard Knox, a great scholar of classical literature, compared their position in cultural memory to the Romans, and given how far the term “shah” traveled that is perfectly fair.\n\nBUT, if we are talking about morality an stuff, they were fundamentally a military empire that enforced their rule with at times extreme displays of force. Rebellions, particularly in Egypt, were frequent and suppressed with brutal efficiency. The idea of the Persians as soft and effeminate is a late development, perhaps largely due to Xenophon. Herodotus makes it quite clear that the Persians were the most fearsome warriors of them all. The emperors themselves matched this—virtually all of them cane to power through war or had to defend their throne, and so the Shahanshah were an unusually capable and long lived bunch, as far as monarchs go. Incompetent Persian emperors died, and quickly.\n\nAnd while there did not seem to be empire wide chattel slavery, slavery was certainly not banned (I'm not actually certain where that comes from) nor were other forms of forced labor. The Persepolis Fortification Archives is, in a way, a giant record of corvee, and military colonies, which were basically transplanted communities hat were bound into military service, dotted the empire.\n\nWhich is not to say that they actually were an Evil Empire but they were, you know, an empire, and empires are won and ruled by force. Empires are also not ruled through pointless cruelty: Herodotus claims that Cambyses purposely murdered the Apis bull and visited other atrocities on Egypt, but inscriptions show that he was careful to rule in an Egyptian manner. Likewise, the Persians tolerated, even celebrated, religious and cultural differences, as we can see through reliefs that proudly boast of the diversity of the empire. And again, this is normal—the idea of “un roi, une loi, une foi” is a very modern one, ancient imperialists didn't really care how you dressed or who your worshipped as long as the tribute kept coming in.\n\nSo were the Persians Elphaba, Wicked Empire of the East? No. Were the Glinda the Good Empire of the East? They were an empire, maintained through force, but not a bad sort as all that.\n\nSo what about the Spartans? The Spartans are interesting because they were committed to a sort of radical equality unseen in the rest of Greece, with even a degree of female empowerment well outside of Athens' dreams, but with a certain class. The citizens of Sparta (Lokonia, really, Sparta is the central settlement of Lakonia but did not have the sort of significance that Athens had to Attica, anyway)  are today often called the “Spartiates” but called themselves the “homoioi” or “equals”. The notion of equality is baked into the idea of Spartan citizenship, and it went far beyond democratic Athens. In Athens, for example, the feast and symposium was a way of displaying social superiority, and getting on the right guest lists was socially important. In Sparta, the ideal was the “mess-hall” where everyone dined together as equals. The rank distinctions within the citizenry that defined Athenian life didn't really exist.\n\nOf course there were quite a few distinctions outside the citizens class. Helots are the most famous—an unfree serf class that seems to have been a tad restless. Athens' strategy in the Peloponnesian War, for example, relied on attempts to induce helot revolt. But Sparta was not just a cowering servile class ruled by a (also cowering, but in a different way) military class, as their society was complicated and often opaque to modern researchers. The perioikoi are sometimes called a mercantile middle class in modern sources but this is wrong, all we know is that they were not of the homoioi but they were not of the helots, and we know they served in the military. There were also the skiritai which were...something. They are mentioned briefly by Xenophon and Thucydides but we have very little idea of what they were.\n\nIt is actually quite stunning how little we know about Sparta. For example, every account will describe in lurid detail the Krypteia, in which young homoioi wander around the countryside murdering helots. But there is a pretty convincing argument that this is a very late development, specifically due to the reestablishment of Messenia which created a sort of  insurgency along the Lakonian frontier. We know so little about Sparta that we don;t know whether this was a murderous coming of age ceremony or a specific response to low insurgency conflict. Which leads me to this:\n\n&gt;I visited the \"ruins\" of Sparta last year and the professor who was the tour guide stopped in an empty field and said \"look around you, this is Sparta. This is what they left behind. No architecture, no science, no poems, no novels, no plays, no music, nothing. Just grass in a field. This is what a military society is worth.\"\n\nI hear this distressingly often, particularly from that uncivilized tribe of scholars known as “art historians”. It is true that Sparta has produced few archaeological remains, albeit the presence of a modern city over it is partially to blame, but more broadly their society does not seem to be as rich as, say, Athens. But Athenian prosperity, as anybody who has read Pericles' funeral oration knows, was built on the back of imperial coercion, their awesome, in the classic sense of the term, buildings and art were funded through sometimes brutal conquest. Those who don't think so can ask the Melians.\n\nThis is not to say that the *300* narrative of chiseled Spartans against deformed Persians is correct. But they both had their ups and downs and being all second opiniony about it gets us nowhere.\n\nI honestly don't know of a good single source on Persian history, but the Great Courses series on them is quite good. For Sparta, Paul Cartledge is one of the leading figures in the field and has several works published.",

        "author": "Thirtyk94",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/38gqva/m4_sherman_common_myths/",
        "text": "Anytime discussions about World War 2 pop up so too do discussions about the ultimate superiority of German tanks and how the Sherman was little more than a glorified coffin on tracks. This could not be farther from the truth. Here I will be discussing three of the most common and enduring myths of the Sherman tank.\n\nFirst up is the armor of the Sherman, which is often criticized as being too thin and making the tank overly vulnerable to all forms of anti-tank weaponry of the period. The Sherman was actually one of the best armored medium tanks of the war from the front, far better than its equals the much vaunted and revered T-34, and the undervalued Panzer IV. The 51 mm of frontal hull armor on the Sherman was sloped back at 56 degrees from the vertical, giving it an effective armor value only slightly lower than that of the Tiger's 100 mm of un-sloped armor. The turret was protected by 76 mm of frontal armor which is enough to get the job done against the kinds of weapons it was facing. The sides and rear are sadly however another story entirely. The 38-45 mm of armor on the sides of the hull while weak, is about the same as that of the Panther and slightly more then that of the Panzer IV. The Waffenamt released a report which estimated that a Sherman angled sideways at 30 degrees would be impervious to the 8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56 gun of the Tiger and that the Panther would have to close to under 100 m to penetrate the Sherman with its 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70 gun under the same conditions. The conclusion on the armor is that the armor was either superior or equal to nearly everything the Sherman faced in combat during World War 2.\n\nNext up is the legendary \"Ronson\" moniker. People often point to the fact the Sherman uses an aircraft engine as evidence of how the Sherman would light up \"first time, every time\", as per the tag line of the source lighter. Now the engine may have been an aircraft engine, but that does not mean it must run on high octane fuel [as this famous Youtube personality erroneously explains.](https://youtu.be/zcMHqUC9YvM?t=5m18s) Instead of high octane gasoline the Sherman used more often than not around 80 octane fuel, that's a lower octane rating than the lowest octane rated gasoline available at a gas station today, not to mention the ratings for octane differ on the type of vehicle being used. The standard 110 aircraft octane rating fuel is actually more around 130 octane fuel for ground vehicles. Now the Ronson myth does however have a bit of truth to it. Early Shermans had very vulnerable ammo racks which were stored in the [\"humps\" near the front of the hull.](http://i.imgur.com/YK8aBV5.jpg?1) The placement of these ammo racks made it easy for German gunners to know where to hit for catastrophic kills on the Sherman tanks. The army knew of this problem and moved immediately to fix it. The army developed \"wet\" ammo racks which involved putting the ammo racks inside of water filled jackets to douse any embers or fires immediately, and they also moved the ammo racks to the bottom of the tank to reduce the chances of them being hit by AT weapons. Wet stowage reduced the chances of an ammo rack fire or detonation in Sherman tanks to only 15% compared to 60-80% of dry stowage Shermans. The conclusion on the Ronson myth is that while there is truth behind it, the myth has been so overblown as to rival the invulnerability myth of the Tiger.\n\nNext and last is the “it takes five Shermans to kill a cat” myth. Now this one is pretty easy and a real laugh once you understand where it comes from. The myth is that German tanks were so superior to Shermans that the US had to field five Shermans to take them on. A simple answer is required for this one. US army tank platoons operated in groups of five tanks, this was the smallest operational group the US fielded from dedicated tank units. It may take only one Sherman to destroy a pillbox, but any time US command heard there was a tank or armored vehicle in the area they immediately dispatched a platoon regardless of what type of vehicle it was. If it was a Stug they would send five Shermans, a Panzer IV would merit the same response as would a Panther or a Tiger. We must remember this is war, you don’t fight fair, you fight to win and survive another day. You want as much of an unfair advantage over your opponent as is possible. If you were the commanding officer of a tank platoon you wouldn’t tell two of your tanks to head home when you find the vehicle you are after is a Stug III. You would likely tell those two tanks to sit back and cover your advance so as to make sure you and your other two tanks aren’t ambushed and killed while you engage the Stug. The same principle applied to higher numbers of enemy tanks, if the enemy had a platoon of tanks you went in with a company of tanks and so on and so on. This part of the US armor doctrine has unfortunately lead many to believe the German tanks were of far superior quality when in fact they were often comparable or even inferior to the Sherman in terms of combat performance. There is a reason tankers preferred the Sherman over the M26 Pershing even during World War 2 and why we quickly switched out our Pershings for M46 Pattons and you guessed it Shermans during the Korean War. The conclusion to this myth is that while it again had a basis in fact these facts have been twisted and misinterpreted into something they are not and in fact quite dramatically refute.\n\nSources:\n\nZaloga, Steve.

        "text": "&gt;Does anyone else think in the long run Predators aren't much of a threat to humans?\n\n&gt;They seem to have very little technological progress since we've got evidence of them having the same same level of technology over thousands of years. In the same period humans have improved technologically enormously.\n\n&gt;They show too much respect for notions of chivalry. Humans do sort of believe in this stuff, but only when it suits them.\n\n&gt;E.g. consider humans with Predator level technology against a civilisation with dark ages technology. It'd be a slaughter. In fact in the New World the Spanish had a much smaller technological advantage of the Aztecs and yet it was still a slaughter.\n\n&gt;I.e. as usual societies that pride themselves on being 'warrior races' aren't actually that effective as warriors. You're better off concentrating on technological advance and adopting a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to dealing with other cultures.\n\n&gt;Incidentally there's one example of a human civilisation at a slight technological disadvantage totally defeating one that prided itself on being a warrior race - the US and UK versus Nazi Germany in WWII. The allies used relatively low technology with great ruthlessness - Lancaster and B29 bombers against population targets. They also mass manufactured Sherman tanks. Individually a Sherman was no match for a German Panzer. Still the difference in production rates meant the Germans were slowly Zerg rushed by the greater numbers of mass manufactured Allied crap.\n\n&gt;The Nazis didn't regard the war in the East as a place for chivalry - they saw it as a war of annihilation against subhumans - but it seems they did sort of regard the war in the West as being a fight against equals with whom they hoped to conclude a negotiated peace. And they seemed to be genuinely horrified when Churchill and Harris carpet bombed them with great enthusiasm to force unconditional surrender despite that.\n\n&gt;Now the difference is that the UK didn't regard the war against Germany as being in any way glorious or chivalric but rather about industrialized slaughter aimed at trashing German industry. Which worked very well indeed.\n\n&gt;I.e. subpar technology and a cynical view of war works. Advanced technology and an overly romanticised view of honourable, heroic warriors doesn't.\n\n**Why it's bad history**:\n\n* Describes Lancaster and B29 bombers as \"low-technology.\" State-of-the-art technology that served way into post-war times.\n* Claims a Sherman was no match for a German Panzer. Panzer just means \"tank.\" I'm sure a Sherman could have taken on a Panzer II\n* Claims Allied success in WW2 was due to \"zerg rushing with crap.\" Whereas Allied technology was absolutely on par especially in later stages of the war.\n* UK followed a strategy of \"industrialized slaughter\", whatever that means. That term would rather apply to the Holocaust.\n* Allied victory was thanks to \"subpar technology\" and a cynical view of war.\n\nBonus: Another redditor suggested this as /r/badhistory material. The Redditor in question's response: \n&gt;/r/badhistory[1] is more like 'Oh no, some people are interpreting history in non bleeding heart liberal approved ways'.\nWe BARBECUED those Germans and we LIKED it.\n\nSauce: http://np.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/37u4v6/predator_dark_ages_2015_720p/crq0c5a\n\n# BONUS: OP APPEARED TO DEFEND HIMSELF - SCROLL DOWN TO CHALLENGE HIM",

        "text": "The [badhistory](https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3873r2/eli5_how_did_slave_masters_sleep_wouldnt_they_be/crsu9nn)\n\n&gt;despite what the narrative on slavery likes to teach us... slavery wasn't \"roots\" or \"12 years a slave\" most of the time.\n\n&gt;sadly people back then considered slaves as property. it wasn't always a matter of skin color, there were slaves of all colors, but more often than not it was black slaves who were captured by black tribes in africa and sold into bondage as part of the spice and slave trade.\n\n&gt;if someone owned a slave, in a majority of cases, it was considered a piece of farming equipment. in the same way that a farmer today wouldn't intentionally smash his combine into the barn or leave his tools in the rain to rust... a slave owner didn't just beat the fuck out of his slaves or starve them to death...\n\n&gt;beaten and weak slaves can't plow your field, it was in the slave owners best interest to keep his slaves fed and clothed and healthy.\n\n&gt;did they live in a nice house and eat steak and drink champagne... fuck no they didn't... they were slaves.\n\n&gt;but they damn sure weren't treated like shit \"cause racism\" as many responding to this thread would have you believe (because they have been led to believe that nonsense).\n\n&gt;bottom line is slaves weren't ready to kill their masters because their master was the one who fed them and gave them a place to live. you kill your slave master and without your papers of freedom you would just be willed away or auctioned off with the rest of his property... possibly to someone who would treat you poorly.\n\n&gt;TLDR: slavery was a fucking abomination on a human rights level... but it is nothing like what hollywood likes to portray. most slave owners took care of their slaves like they did all their other property.\n\nAnd I'm stealing this pretty well sourced response from /u/thesweetestpunch because I honestly couldn't do much better. I'm ^so ^^sorry.\n\n&gt;[Here is an in-depth, cited refutation of everything that this commenter wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ukppx/just_finished_watching_12_years_a_slave_was_life/). The historians rely pretty heavily on WPA interviews with former slaves from the 1930s, which are excerpted and described in selections [here](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/wpa/index.html). \n\n&gt;Also, if you check this guy's comment history, you'll find a lot of crazy-ass racist stuff, which another commenter pointed out below. Just because someone sounds reasonable and knowledgeable doesn't mean they are.\n\n&gt;It's also wild that they say that slavery wasn't *12 Years a Slave*, considering that that film is based on Solomon Northup's memoirs (which were corroborated with primary documents that he collected - letters and such), which actually depicted *more* cruelty and beatings than the film did. So it is really rich of him to claim that *12 Years a Slave* is fiction! Either he's lying, or ignorant. I suspect both. \n\n&gt;I quote from a few of the historians below: \n\n&gt;&gt;There was a reason why masters beat slaves much more severely than they beat animals--slaves were a lot smarter. Tie an animal to a post and the animal won't and can't run away. Not so with people. If you read the book upon which 12 Years a Slave was based, you'll learn that 24/7 policing was necessary to prevent slaves from running away. You'll also note that in 12 Years a Slave, the cruelty and torture to which Northup was subjected, was not limited to just one person--it was a large number of different people in different circumstances and different states who committed it. As the WPA interviews, and other slave narratives, demonstrate, such cruelty was indeed widespread. Some slaves were lucky enough to avoid some of it. But most could not. White men could basically rape their enslaved women any time they felt like it, with no punishment or even acknowledgement that anything was wrong. In the delicate language of the 19th century, this is described in all the literature. Every slave was subject to being parted from their loved ones at any time, forever. In short, yes, things were as bad for the average slave as were depicted in the film. Not for every slave, but for a very large percentage of them. And actually, if you read the book, you'll see that things were quite a bit WORSE than were depicted in the movie. But if they had depicted it accurately, it would have become redundant and the audience would have been desensitized to the violence and degradation.\n\n&gt;Here's another: \n\n&gt;&gt;I think that you err in assuming that these slave owners' infliction of violence on their slaves was irrational. Your comparison between them and \"Hitler/Satan\" and your example of people not beating their horses suggests this, at least to me. Rather, slave owners' violence was often quite calculated and strategic. As someone else noted in this thread, slaves were much smarter than horses. They saw that they could be beaten or killed for any act of defiance. In the antebellum South, many slave owners maintained a constant atmosphere of violence and fear, in order to keep slaves under control. Slave owners were not simply cruel for no reason. Admittedly, in the film, Epps seemed to be motivated by simple malice. Fassbender's portrayal didn't allow for much nuance. However, slave owners would have known precisely why they were attacking or beating their slaves.\nA final point I'll make tonight is that if we look beyond the antebellum South, prior to the abolition of the slave trade, it was not uncommon for slave owners to beat or work their \"property\" to death, knowing that they could cheaply replace them. Admittedly, this changed to an extent after the slave trade was abolished, but I would argue that the logic was not really that much different in the mid-nineteenth century United States. Slaves were replaceable, and a slave that resisted his/her master's tyranny in any way might seem to be more trouble than he or she was worth. This logic certainly holds for other kinds of property - horses, in your example.\n\n&gt;Then there is this contrasting argument, which still makes the point that rape was commonplace (DNA tests usually reveal a large amount of European DNA in African-Americans, typically dating back to the time of slavery, when consent between the two parties would have been impossible):\n\n&gt;&gt;In the Virginia Piedmont, by contrast, slaveowners like Madison and Jefferson were the resident governors of their little communities, where the enslaved were often intact families, themselves third or fourth generation Virginians, and interrelated by blood to their white masters. Annette Gordon-Reed in her most recent book, The Hemmingses of Virginia, tries to evoke the reality of mixed-race house slaves, who often were educated and were skilled artisans. James Madison late in life compared that regime to European serfdom. Field slaves often suffered manual punishment, but more severe abuse was unlawful and was sometimes punished. The more common abuses were the rapes of enslaved women, so common as hardly to be recorded. \n\n&gt;People who've responded by saying that the thread originator is racist have gotten a lot of responses saying \"so?\" A lot of people on reddit seem to cling very closely to the ad hominem/poisoning-the-well thing - \"that's a fallacy!\". But here's the thing: If someone demonstrates that they are an unreliable source, you need to press them to corroborate their argument. It's just stupid to respond to a well-poisoner with \"so?\". If someone demonstrates that they are wildly irrational *when it comes to the topic in question*, it throws their entire argument into question and the burden of proof rests on them. \n\n&gt;This is the trouble with relying on logical fallacies to debunk stuff: Yes, in principle, a virulent racist who believes that black people are apes *can* have an excellent argument about something race-related, or lots of knowledge. But in practice, that person is probably going to be totally wrong and totally misinformed, and their racist agenda casts a big shadow over their argument. The burden of proof as always goes to the *person making the original argument*, not the person saying \"hey, don't listen to this guy, he's a sack of shit and here's why.\" Dismissing fallacies on principle only goes so far; you wouldn't loan your money to a person who defaulted on all their debts without some sort of collateral, so why would you give credit to a shitty racist without vetted sources on their information? \n\n&gt;You're giving karma and credence to a virulent racist who is ignorant of history and willfully spreading lies. Good job guys. \n\n&gt;*Edited for clarity, and to remove some redundancies*\n",

If you count WW2 as one. It was with many countries over a decade. The Russo-Japanese was also their fault.\n\n*What?*\n\nJapan invaded Korea in the 1590s, as /u/JesseWayne21 (correctly) notes. Guess whose soldiers landed off Busan in May 1592? Yep. It was definitely a war initiated by Japan. Not only did the Japanes invasion of Korea involve the Korean army, navy, and militias, Ming China was also massively involved in the war against Japan. [Even four Africans were involved](http://i.imgur.com/WSP3ewT.png) (although they seem to have accomplished little). \n\nThere was also the First Sino-Japanese War which I know less about, [but Japan was not at all irresponsible for the war.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War#Early_stages_of_the_war) There was [the Invasion of Ryukyu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Ryukyu) which was certainly not very bloody, but still a military campaign instigated by Japan against another country. Japan also invaded Taiwan in 1895, crushing the fledgling Republic of Formosa. If we consider an independent raid as a war the number of wars started by Japanese people rises exponentially.\n\n**TL;DR:** Japan has started more than two wars with foreign nations in its history.

You've found a small, tribal settlement surrounded by other small, tribal settlements.\n\n&gt;4.Gain their trust as a wiseman through my demonstration of basic medicine and physics. ☑\n\nA few problems here - even assuming OP already understands the tribal dialect of the region, his basic knowlege of medicine and physics is unlikely to be much help. While basic sanitation might be useful, aside from that it's unlikely he will gain a \"wise man\" status among people who find most of his ideas useless in their everyday lives and who probably already have revered and respected figures within their own society.\n\n&gt;5.Become their leader by outliving everyone and being the most knowledgeable in future generations. ☑\n\nBecome their leader? This is somewhat unlikely, as his immortal status and bizarre ideas may not inspire a lot of confidence in a society where much of his knowledge is irrelevant. If anything, he'd probably become known for his knowledge of the history of the settlement gained through experience, but little else.\n\n&gt;6.Teach them more advanced farming and engineering techniques. ☑\n\nAlright, so this figure has spontaneously developed knowledge not only on how to farm more efficiently without modern fertilizers, implements, pesticides, or seed availability, but how to build large structures without an effective concrete, precision tools, or a steady source of high-quality stone for a settlement of a few hundred at most. \n\n&gt;7.Technologically surpass every other civilisation by 500 BC. ☑\n\nSo under this redditor's enlightened rulership, a tiny, isolated settlement has been able to surpass **literally every other civilization on the planet** in every possible field of science despite having little to no contact with any major power of the time in Europe, not to mention Zhou China. This begs the question of course- what does he even mean by \"Technologically Surpass?\" Does he literally lead in every field of study known to mankind, from trade infrastructure to military weaponry to political ideology? On top of this, many fields of study greatly valued by other empires would have little to no application in such circumstances, and short of wasting immense manpower on pointless \"scientific\" projects with only a vague notion of the end result in mind such a claim would be blatantly false. Likewise, this entire idea reeks of civ-like linear tech trees and focused research in an era where neither was at all feasible.\n&gt;8.Encourage science over religion as well as large families to grow the population. ☑\n\nAlright, this is ridiculous. Attempting to \"encourage science over religion\" is essentially asking the people he rules to turn their back on the religious and cultural heritage of their fathers and forefathers to the nth degree, and would almost certainly result in him losing whatever power he previously had over these people. Even were he to be impossibly lucky and somehow not end up being exiled immediately, his lack of a description on how he would \"encourage science\" is somewhat alarming. Will he be building universities? Leading mass literacy programs? Burning religious idols and desecrating holy artifacts to spread \"enlightenment\"? No matter what he chooses to do he is still the leader of a small settlement that lacks the infrastructure and resources to attempt such huge and vaguely defined initiatives with any lasting success. In addition, his idea of encouraging large families is bizarre because sedentary farming families already had large families, and unless he also happens to be extremely experienced in natal care the infant mortality rate is unlikely to decline for millenia.\n\n&gt;9.With my medieval age civilisation by 0 AD I send missionaries out into Brettania to spread the word of science and peace. ☑\n\n\"After collapsing my entire one tribal settlement and leading in the rise of feudal lords and the serfdom system to artificially advance society somehow...\" The term \"Medieval\" is not at all appropriate here socially, and technologically would be vitually impossible to perform along with literally every other claim of advancement made here even for a being now alive for over a millenium. Much of the technological advancement of the middle ages, which were  heavily inspired due to the social and political transitions of the time, would not be feasible for an isolated settlement like the one he has somehow retained control of here. And as for sending out missionaries, I'm sure the many peoples of the region will take kindly to foreigners urging them to abandon their own religions to worship some ideological abstraction, and will eagerly convert to the church of Dawkins immediately.\n\n&gt;10.Formally declare the most centralised area of my civilisation as the city of Glasgow, setting up trade routes through land and the River Clyde. ☑\n\nSo now he's \"setting up trade routes\" which are obviously just decided by the government and don't gradually develop over tine, and has somehow managed to urbanize without any actual economic activity to speak of here aside from subsistence farming and le science or any change in leadership or social structure.\n\n&gt;11.With my expanding civilisation I encourage them to work towards more advanced things than I know, such as the arts and architecture by 500 AD. ☑\n\nDisregarding the fact he's been dealing with things far too specialized for most people in the modern world to have a practical knowlege of since day one, his ideas of how art is developed are again seriously civ-oriented and he has yet to offer any explanations as to how he's gone from a tiny settlement to this vast, expanding civilization.\n\n&gt;12.Peacefully unite all civilisations in Britain and Ireland by 600. ☑\n\nBAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... Wait, is he serious? So somehow he has managed to accomplish a job that neither the Romans nor the Early English could do fully, a matter the UK still struggles with today, all thanks to a few brave souls accepting the ideals of peace, science, and euphoria which were so appealing to the peoples of the time. Not only that, during this time period he would run into not only the Romans, but the Saxons and a host of other invaders both from within and outside of the isles who would be even less likely to accept peaceful unification than the small-scale settlements of previous centuries.\n\n&gt;13.Forbid the leaving of the islands, having only my most trusted merchants trade raw materials for more exotic ones to bring back. ☑\n\nHow the hell is he going to enforce border control here? Even accepting all of the impossible things of the past somehow happened, he could not possibly hope to enforce this in a region so large and so expansive. Even in Japan, where ethnic and political conditions made such an outcome even more likely, self-imposed isolation under the Tokugawa failed in less than 300 years, and he hopes to somehow accomplish this in an area with a much more diverse culture and more overall ties to the mainland? On top of that, what does he hope to attain through this isolation? Is he trying to protect his impossible technology, which has surely already spread through most of Europe due to his failure to address this issue until uniting the isles? If so, this isolation seems to be awfully different from his precious policy of spreading science *cough cough* religion and opening up contacts around the world. Additionally, this view of trade essentially places a few people in control of the commerce of the entire nation, which is sure to lead to absolute equality and wealth for his people and absolutely no political and economic corruption whatsoever. \n\n&gt;14.Create an order of those deemed most trustworthy and moral to act as senate with me as adviser. ☑\n\nSo the leader of this science-worshiping theocracy has now appointed a senate based on morals and trustworthiness. I'm sure the people he chooses will all lead with the same inspired touch he has for the last two millenia, and he will surely be content with his rule as a veritable figurehead...no, he's going to still rule as a god-king as always. What was the point in adding this step?\n\n&gt;15.By 1500 AD develop modern technology. ☑\n\n\"And so in the year of our Aalewis 1500, the great civilization of the Irish developed Modern Technology while in self-imposed isolation, industrializing and electrifying virtually overnight with no corresponding social or political changes aside from a pointless senate for reasons that shall not be named.\"\n\n&gt;16.Create a surveillance network of other countries. ☑\n\n\"And so spies were sent throughout Europe, which due to the glorious self-isolation of Ireland was still ruled by backwards fundie scum, and collected information on lesser peoples.\"\n\n&gt;17.Do nothing during World War 1. Germany wins. ☑\n\nAlright, this is probably the most blatant badhistory of all here. Somehow, despite total isolationism in Britain affecting world politics immensely, modern World War One somehow still happens despite the fact that virtually EVERYTHING would have happened differently in global politics. This statement could merit its own badhistory post altogether, but we must move on to...\n\n&gt;18.Germany attempts to invade Britain. Is met by future era weaponry. ☑\n\nGermany: The nation so blindly violent it tries to randomly attack a nation without sending any sort of spies into the nation's huge, permeable borders. Of course, maybe all three of their spies were killed trying to steal technology from Glasgow 100 turns or whatever ago, as that seems to be the mindset of OP here. Likewise, I love how OP assumes that his technology will never, ever escape his borders, and that an isolationist nation without a war in 1400 years will obviously be able to easily dispatch one of the most formidable armies of the world due to SCIENCE.\n\n&gt;19.The time is right. Invade Europe. ☑\n\nWhat exactly happened to our nation's 1400 year old tradition of peace, love, science, and isolation? Aw, fuck it, let's just invade everywhere. At this point things have strayed so far from history this is more delusion than badhistory, but even so I must go on to the final point on this godawful list...\n\n&gt;20.Get nuked by Gandhi. ☐\nThis Civ Joke is probably the most reasonable thing this guy has said so far.\n\nSo there you have it - quite possibly the greatest, most historically accurate account of the growth of a civilization under an immortal god-emperor ever created.

        "text": "I do not have a bad history topic as what is usually found in this sub, but still have something that is bad on both ends. A couple of days ago, I got in a pissing contest with some random redditor. The disagreement was over the view of virginity in Ancient Rome. Originally, when the user disagreed with what I had been taught about the subject, essentially that virginity was not a strict societal norm, I pulled up sources that supported my argument and just thought that was that: [Thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/37nob5/what_knowledgethings_do_you_think_were_lost_in/crq54z8?context=3).\n\nThe user, u/moxy801, was not able to successfully argue the way that historians and students are taught to. The poster showed no sign that he or she had had any educational training and I took advantage of that. Because I found ways to easily discredit u/moxy801's argument, I became entirely too pompous and short-sided. I am not an expert in Ancient Rome, but I know how to research secondary sources. Though I did find sources in peer-reviewed journals to support my argument, I disregarded that what I was talking about is more complex then I chose to portray it and that I had a chance to educate without being superior. We both are guilty of bad history.\n\nOriginally, I was agreeing with a thread about Roman birth control that has been lost. I stated something taught to me in my Western Civ class, which was that pre-marital sex was not a huge hang up for Romans. When u/moxy801 disagreed (simply stating: \"Yes they did\"), I came back with a source.\n\nHowever, it did not matter what the source was or what it was saying. No matter, because:\n\n    Eh, just someone trying to be revisionist.\n\nThat is it. That set me off. It did not matter if I have evidence from other historians. If sources were researched in depth, with creditable sources that were cited for the world to see. Anything I say is mute because I am being a \"revisionist\".\n\nI countered back that revisionism is not a bad word, asked for the user's sources, then found another source stating my position. Again, it does not matter because:\n\n    It is [bad] when it is revisionism for its own sake.\n\nI agree. There should be academic foundation to revisionism, but lets look at this in context of the accusation. R/moxy801 is accusing me of rewriting this part of history to be right. Keeping in mind that I did not just write up articles out of the blue to support my own argument. I did not just make up a historian and journals out of nowhere. The user is discrediting the research that has been done, as if an article in Johns Hopkins' American Journal of Philology (a peer-reviewed journal) would be accepted if it was bad revisionism without any real foundation.\n\nI lost it for the rest of the discussion as you can very well see. I discredited u/moxy801's source and spent some time explaining what a good source may encompass. When u/moxy801 did not counter back with anything but pointing out that I could not reference a play that shows sex before marriage, I concluded that I \"won\" and went overboard with it.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing that bothers me and to tell the truth it bothers me the most. I am also discouraged by this exchange. Are these the \"historians\" on r/history? Users like r/moxy801 who do not know how to properly back up a claim, let alone know what makes good source with little biases or actual historical foundation.\n\nI was downvoted. I sincerely hope it was because I was being pompous. I did not show a good side of myself or my profession, which I love. I hope that it was not because I demanded journal entries and professional sources. That I appeared to be unnecessarily revisionist. In other words, I hope that the valid points I made against u/moxy801 were ignored because of my bad attitude and not because r/history does not care about the validity of historical claims being made.\n",

This man claims to have found ancient Hebrew text in burial mounds in Ohio and Viking runes and artifacts in Arizona, claiming that ancient Christians fled to the Americas 2000 years ago to avoid persecution and that the Vikings had a complex network of settlements throughout the continent. The absurdity of being allowed to excavate a burial mound aside (NAGPRA and all that), the idea that the Vikings went further than Newfoundland or that anyone from the middle east crossed the Atlantic is absurd. Desert dwelling people aren't exactly known for their sea fairing prowess and the Amerindians vastly out numbered any viking settlers and completely rebuffed any attempts at long-term settlement.

        "text": "[Link.](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/07/christopher-condon/was-there-an-ancient-civilization-on-antarctica/) This is also a /r/badscience gem but I'll focus on the history.\n\n&gt; The continent of Antarctica has been in the news. This does not happen very often. Home to only a handful of temporary residents and mostly covered by ice, Antarctica has little about it to attract the attention of the rest of the world. But Russian scientists have been doing some important scientific work there. They drilled through the massive layer of ice covering Greater Antarctica, and on February 5, 2012, made it all the way down to Lake Vostok, an ancient lake unknown to modern man. There may be many surprises yet to come because our knowledge about Antarctica is still very scant. After all, modern man did not discover Antarctica until 1818, and even then had no idea what land features lay beneath the ice until scientific advances made this possible in 1958.\n\nIn the introduction, Christopher Condon, [conspiracy theorist,](https://www.lewrockwell.com/author/christopher-condon/?ptype=article) explains the discovery of [Lake Vostok,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Vostok) a large subglacial lake in Antarctica. According to Condon, Vostok shows that \"there may be many surprises yet to come because our knowledge about Antarctica is still very scant.\" This is true. There are many things we do not know much about the southernmost continent, and with further research there could very well be many more surprises yet to come. That does not mean that Atlantis was actually Antarctica. A comparison: there are many things we do not know about Amazonian flies. This does not mean that flies have built a mighty civilization in Brazil which a nefarious cabal in academia is trying to conceal.\n\n&gt; Some unorthodox investigators with an interest in remote antiquity believe that as our exploration of Antarctica continues, we might eventually stumble on the remnants of the lost civilization of Atlantis. \n\n\"Unorthodox investigators\" is a pretty funny euphemism for \"moronic conspiracy theorists who have never done actual research in Antarctica.\"\n\n&gt; A few centuries before Christ, Plato, the Greek philosopher, wrote that an advanced civilization that he called Atlantis existed in remote antiquity until it succumbed virtually overnight to a natural catastrophe around 10,000 BC. Now Plato provided many details regarding the city of Atlantis as it was in its heyday. \n\nThe tale of Atlantis was never a historical treatise. The story of Atlantis *was an allegorical parable written to illustrate Plato's philosophical points.* ([more information on this /r/AskHistorians thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11jpap/what_is_the_officialacademic_consensus_on/)) I don't see people trying to argue that Thomas More's Utopia actually existed, nor do people think the Ryukyu Islands were actually infested by demons in the 17th century, nor are \"unorthodox investigators\" trying to precisely locate Plato's Cave. So why this obsession with Atlantis?\n\nI mean, simply look at the date. Atlantis is said to have fallen around 10000 BC. Seen from archaeological evidence, Egyptians who the tale of Atlantis supposedly came from started writing almost seven thousand years after Atlantis fell. Hmm.\n\n&gt; Based upon this information, it is possible that the continent that we call Antarctica was the same continent that Plato called Atlantis. \n\nFirst, Atlantis was not claimed to be as big as Middle East + North Africa: it was supposedly as large as Asia Minor + Ancient Libya, which is significantly smaller than both Middle East + North Africa *and* the continent of Antarctica. Second, from *Timaeus* actually by Plato:\n\n&gt; For the ocean there was at that time navigable; **for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,'** there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together\n\n[The Pillars of Heracles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Hercules) refer to the Strait of Gibraltar. Plato explicitly states that his allegorical island was in front of the Strait of Gibraltar, which Antarctica definitely is not. \n\n&gt; The legends of many Native Americans are reminiscent of what Plato wrote about Atlantis and thus reinforce our suspicion that Atlantis existed. In addition, these legends, emanating from tribes separated by great distances and isolated from one another, nonetheless tell a similar story of a fallen civilization called Aztlan where their ancestors dwelled long ago. \n\nNo. First, similar legends can be found throughout the world. Myths of a great flood are everywhere. Both Mesoamerica and East Asia had a serpentine figure with great symbolic meaning. There are parallels between [Ningyo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/SekienNingyo.jpg) and mermaids. And so on.\n\nSecondly, *Aztlan* is a Nahuatl word, and the \"tribes\" that spoke Nahuatl were in close contact to each other by Aztec times. More broadly, the very diverse peoples who spoke the Uto-Aztecan languages which Nahuatl belongs to were all in indirect contact with each other. It was hardly a case of \" tribes separated by great distances and isolated from one another.\" If both the Selknam in Tierra del Fuego and the Cree in Canada believed in something called *Aztlan* I might be more convinced. This is clearly not the case.\n\n&gt; The most famous of these is a map drawn in 1513 by Piri Reis, an admiral serving in the navy of the Ottoman Empire. The Piri Reis map, which Piri Reis based not on his own research but on older, perhaps even ancient sources, accurately traces the coastline of Antarctica but does not show the layer of ice that covers that coastline today. This suggests that whoever drew the original maps upon which Piri Reis later based his map saw Antarctica before it was covered by ice. \n\nThe [Piri Reis map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis_map) also lacks most of North America and the Gulf of Mexico. Clearly, this means that North America and the Gulf of Mexico did not exist until comparatively recently in geological time, because Piri Reis could of course never have made mistakes out of lack of knowledge/sources. Am I right. Anyways, from the Wikipedia article\n\n&gt; As far as the accuracy of depiction of the supposed Antarctic coast is concerned, there are two conspicuous errors. First, it is shown hundreds of miles north of its proper location; second, the Drake Passage is completely missing, with the Antarctic Peninsula presumably conflated with the Argentine coast.\n\n&gt; It should be kept in mind that maps of the period generally depicted a large continent named Terra Australis Incognita of highly variable shape and extent. This land was posited by Ptolemy as a counterbalance to the extensive continental areas in the northern hemisphere.\n\nBack to the linked \"article\"\n\n&gt; Common sense would suggest that agriculture probably arose among a few enterprising persons somewhere on earth, after which time their neighbors, seeing its clear superiority, copied it until eventually it worked its way around the entire globe. The evidence, however, shows that agriculture arose simultaneously and independently at several different places on earth. Especially puzzling is the fact that all these places were around 4500 feet above sea level rather than at sea level.\n\nCommon sense would not suggest that at all. Besides, I would love to learn how exactly all of the [American East](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Agricultural_Complex) is as high as the Appalachians, or how the North China Plain or Yangtze Plain is as high as [Mount Tai,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tai) or how the Niger basin is [higher than Mali's highest mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hombori).",

It's about a secret war between groups of immortals and shady government forces and some person gets caught up all of it, that sort of stuff. Pretty decent up to a point, but upon hitting Chapter 8 I had a problem.\n\n\nA flashback episode. A flashback about how immortality came to be in the first place. It takes place in around 1000's England and Norway, and this is where things go wrong. So. *So.* Wrong. So thus, I give you a breakdown of the most agonizing and absolutely WRONG historical drama's that I have ever pained through. And just to be sure I stay coherent for all of this I will only be drinking light cider during this listening. Anyone who wants to sing along can begin [right here](https://youtu.be/1AWR1PBbBU0?t=1108) around the 18:30 mark.\n\nLet the drinking commence!\n\n___________________________\n\nScene is 1043 in a southern Norwegian coastal town called Somnertock. The narrator says that Christianity is starting to take hold in Scandinavia and the First Crusade is only 30 years away. Which is  bit off since the First Crusade started in 1096, but that's not a big issue. They follow up and say that regional power was constantly shifting across the area, with local rulers engaging in constant power struggles that undermined any sense of national identity. This is a bit odd, since this is taking place during the rule of [Cnut the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great#Statesmanship) who had a very solid hold on most of England, Denmark, and Norway, you can see his empire [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Canute.PNG) with his in red and vassal states in orange, so I'm not sure if it's wise to portray the region all *Game of Thrones* yet.\n\n\nAlright, now we meet our heroine Evangeline Liefric. Bit of an odd name for a Norse woman, since the name itself has Greek roots and the first known use of it was from *Uncle Tom's Cabin*, but whatever. We also learn she is the leader and high priestess of an ancient Nordic tribe called the Valkyries. No such tribe but that's no problem. \n\n\nAnd now we learn that this tribe is from the inland and became allies with the British exploration party that stumbled across them several years ago. A bit odd, since Cnut was King of Norway and all the powers of Norway recognized him as such. But maybe these folks were just a bit out of the loop, and by 'allies' they mean that the Valkyries swore fealty to Cnut.\n\n\nThe British -the use of the word 'British' is starting to bug me- were amazed by their technology. It lists that their ship construction was vastly superior, which is interesting given that they were introduced as living in the heavily wooded interior and not near the sea. And evidently there skills in medicine and science were above and beyond the 'British' as well. And just from seeing this application of the word 'science' I'm getting an Dark Ages taste in my mouth. This is a minute and a half in. \n\n\n\nWe meet her lover and head of the ~~British~~ English exploration crew, yet another Greek name, Piter. Evangeline starts ranting about how the town council declined her request for saffron to create a vaccine for people infected with some strange and horrible disease quarantined on a nearby island. Now saffron is believed to possibly help with depression and PMS,otherwise you'd have as much luck squeezing a vaccine out of cinnamon. Not to mention that the earliest records of vaccinations are from China around this time -although it's more likely that it didn't happen until centuries later- so I doubt an isolated band of Norse in the sticks of Norway would have managed to come up with it. Piter mentions that the disease is 'divine punishment' on the pagans and we find out that Evangeline is evidently a very 'enlightened' woman from how she calls Christianity a 'Patriarchal, monotheistic lie'. \n\n\n\nEvangeline begs her hubby to do something but he says that civil law falls under the Church and that the town council members are picked by the local Bishop as opposed to Cnut's appointed rulers.\n\n\nGood grief, this whole Valkyrie tribe is such a pandering to the Tumblr audience. Wise Matriarchal society ruled by women chosen for their wisdom, deeply knowledgeable in medicine and science, and believe everyone should be treated equally and they're all just so fucking enlightened just to show off how mean and nasty the Church is.\n\n\n\n&gt; Piter had met Evangeline several years earlier as the British explored Scandinavia on behalf of the Church of England. The Crusades were beginning in earnest and the British had recently launched a successful campaign that combined missionary zeal with their considerable military forces.\n\n\n*Teeth grinding intensifies.* Ignoring the fact that the Church of England has yet to exist for about five centuries, why are they exploring it? Scandinavia was not some mysterious unexplored territory, most of the inhabitants of England at the time had strong roots to Scandinavia and they certainly had no shortage of interaction with one another, I mean constant warfare and invasions is a good way to get to know the other's geography. Also why the fuck is the Church suddenly ordering everything, you'd almost think that all this land was currently controlled by one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon kings. \n\n\n\n\nAlso, *what?* In the intro monologue they established that the First Crusade was thirty years away -more like fifty- and now the English already launched one? That's not even considering that the First Crusade was mostly composed of forces from France, Bavaria, and Lombardy. \n\n\n\nThey now mention that dear Piter -who's titled as a Commandant for some reason- is a successful naval commander who's -get this- secretly an atheist. Fucking lovely. \n\n\n&gt; However, he did believe in the civilizing forces of British Colonization. To bring medicine, schooling, and rule of law to otherwise savage nations. To bring justice to a world still largely ruled by barbarians was, in his mind, a noble vocation.\n\n\nPiter, carrying the White Mans Burden before it was cool. Honestly though, could they not even bother a few quick google session for this show? England was on-par with it's contemporaries, and some would argue that the Norse societies were more socially progressive than England. \n\n\nNow it talks about how the savage Viking nations had long been a thorn in England's side, and a contrast to ordered English society. You can get a better understanding of Norse culture from VeggieTale's *Lyle the Kindly Viking.*\n\n\n\nThe Valkyrie tribe apparently considers themselves too-evolved to embrace organized religion and preferred to devote themselves to science. I'm starting to sense a very subtle message. \n\n\nBackstory of the Valkyrie's fighting a tribe called the Skaradoths, who are savage pagan barbarians who sacrifice children and eat their enemies and are described as 'Wiccan.' \n\n\n\nA flashback to Piter and Evangeline first meeting and he explaining the English desire to convert Norway to christianity, despite the [Christianization of Norway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_Scandinavia#Norway) having begun about a century earlier.\n\n\nThere's an annoying use of words in a modern context that don't apply to the setting. British 'Intelligence', and the use of the word 'science' to describe a very modern definition of the term, even though the science of then and now are leagues apart. Also they talk about the 'British Navy' travelling the globe and being some mighty force, apparently forgetting that there isn't really any such thing at this time. Not to mention how they talk about British Colonial power and Colonial law in 1043, not 1843. \n\n\nAnd now the evil Kriegerson walks in, asking Piter to command an 'experimental' new English warship designed for 'long-term sustainability' and 'maximum firepower.' I'm curious as to what sort of firepower they're talking about in days when naval battles meant chaining your ships to the enemy one and killing them all hand-to-hand.\n\n\n&gt; \"It was built using a Norse design.\"\n\n\nSo, basically just like the current longships that the English would already have?\n\n\n&gt; \"but with hardwoods found only in parts of Spain. It uses multiple masts and a unique steering system to make it the faster ship in the water, with multiple crossbow stations on each side.\"\n\n\nAh yes, the 'More Masts equals Faster Ship' school of naval architecture. And I'm not sure what a crossbow station is. Kriegerson claims that it's going to be used to subdue Bulgarian pirates in the Aegean and Mediterranean, and that Bulgaria has fallen to Pagan faiths, despite the fact that Bulgaria was [currently ruled by the Byzantines.](http://figures.boundless.com/24995/full/-06-11-20at-203.16.58-20pm.png) Hilariously we're told that the pagan Bulgarians have cut off shipping between Rome and Constantinople. \n\n\n\n&gt; Kriegerson whispered to Piter, \"Nordic influence has overcome most of England.\" \n\n\nLol\n\n\n\nAaaand now he's going on about his desire to see a Christian Empire control England and Scandinavia, and this is just too much stupid for me to bother. This isn't a result of poor research, this is practically anti-research. They're trying to tell a compelling and realistic story and they lose all momentum in this absolutely ridiculous flashback episode which seems to be made by copy-and-pasting elements from Marvels' Asgard and *History by Tumblr.* And some of it might be tolerable if it wasn't for how infuriatingly smug the show was about it's super matriarchal, rational, scientific, atheistic, and anti-church Viking clan and how all of it's main characters are 'enlightened' about the senseless violence of religion in 10-fucking-43, and it's somewhat creepy pro-Colonial stance.\n\n\n\nI can't take anymore of this, and this was all from just eighteen minutes. Someone else can take up this torch, otherwise let's just burn this goddamn thing down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "ASamFi here, back to reddit and /r/badhistory after a long hiatus! \nBad history in: [*The Guardian*](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/may/27/emoji-language-dragging-us-back-to-the-dark-ages-yellow-smiley-face)\n\nX-post inspired by [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/37h3al/emoji_is_dragging_us_back_to_the_dark_ages_and/) in our sister sub, /r/badlinguistics. \n\nJonathan Jones is a man with a problem. A problem that takes the form of small icons that most people use on a daily basis without a second thought. Most of us think emojis are handy little tools that allow us to avoid writing out our thoughts in a more lengthy manner while texting, a tradition that dates back from when text messages had character limits and were prohibitively expensive. But Jonathan Jones is not fooled by the smiling yellow faces. He knows that those cute little picture-thingummies on his smartphone's keyboard that he has not yet learned how to change back to English are the sign of an ominous historic and linguistic devolution:\n\n&gt;So it’s official. We are evolving backwards. Emoji, the visual system of communication that is incredibly popular online, is Britain’s fastest-growing language according to Professor Vyv Evans, a linguist at Bangor University.\n\n&gt;The comparison he uses is telling – but not in the way the prof, who appears enthusiastic about emojis, presumably intends. “As a visual language emoji has already far eclipsed hieroglyphics, its ancient Egyptian precursor which took centuries to develop,” says Evans.\n\n&gt;Perhaps that is because it is easier to go downhill than uphill. After millennia of painful improvement, from illiteracy to Shakespeare and beyond, humanity is rushing to throw it all away. We’re heading back to ancient Egyptian times, next stop the stone age, with a big yellow smiley grin on our faces.\n\nWhoa! Hold on there, Jonathan. That's very presentist of you, suggesting that people in the past were necessarily less advanced and more \"primitive\" than in modern times! Obviously you're *far superior*, seeing how you single-handedly invented the steam engine, steel, the internal combustion engine, automobiles, skyscrapers, airplanes, space shuttles, personal computers and the smartphone. But okay, sure, let's assume you're better than the average Egyptian *in retrospect*, now that you have the benefit of literally thousands of years of technological and scientific innovation. What else do you have to say, Jonathan?\n\n&gt;Evans compares Emoji with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. Well indeed. ancient Egypt was a remarkable civilisation, but it had some drawbacks. The Egyptians created a magnificent but static culture. They invented a superb artistic style and powerful mythology – then stuck with these for millennia. Hieroglyphs enabled them to write spells but not to develop a more flexible, questioning literary culture: they left that to the Greeks. \n\nOkay, the claim that ancient Egypt was stuck in a time warp for its entire existence is not even remotely true. I need no other source than [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt) to confidently claim that from 3100-30 BCE there were more than a few changes, starting with the fact that *we know approximately when civilization started to appear in Egypt*. The *coming into existence* of Egypt and other civilizations in Africa and the Middle East is proof that there was change over time. The pyramids may seem to be eternal; *but they are not*. Someone put them there. *That's why they're interesting*. \n\nThe other claim is that ancient Egypt did not have a questioning, literary culture because of its writing system. Because obviously, writing with logograms never [permits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh) the [existence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh) of [literary culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms). Only alphabets like we Anglophones use can do that! \n\n&gt;These jumped-up Aegean loudmouths, using an abstract non-pictorial alphabet they got from the Phoenicians, obviously and spectacularly outdid the Egyptians in their range of expression. The Greek alphabet was much more productive than all those lovely Egyptian pictures. That is why there is no ancient Egyptian Iliad or Odyssey.\n\nBesides the [recent papers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102849/) that suggest that the long-held theory that there is a consistent progression from logograms to phonetic alphabets in writing is tinted with ethnocentrism, Jonathan nicely glosses over the fact that the Phoenicians likely developed their alphabet from *stylized hieroglyphics*.  As for his jab about the lack of an Egyptian epic poem, I notice there is no mention of *The Book of the Dead*, likely because it features mythology. Oh wait, Zeus and Athena show up *all the time* in the Homeric epics. That can't be the reason. Huh. I guess Jonathan's just an ignorant, willfully ethnocentric little bitch, then. But wait! There's more! \n\n&gt;In other words, there are harsh limits on what you can say with pictures. The written word is infinitely more adaptable. That’s why Greece rather than Egypt leapt forward and why Shakespeare was more articulate than the Aztecs.\n\nI love how confident Jonathan is in his worldview. Firstly, the idea that there are \"harsh limits on what you can say with pictures\", by which Jonathan refers to \"ideograms\" is easily countered with the example of China. I would say that hanzi are a decent union of \"pictures\" and the \"written word\". Secondly, as for adaptability, let me just say, I don't know, *you can completely change the idea expressed by a Chinese character with a single stroke or radical*? Just because it's not an alphabet does not mean that it's not adaptable; in fact, I would say it's more expressive, since ideograms express ideas directly rather than vaguely representing sounds that are connected to an idea. \n\nAs for Shakespeare being more articulate than the Aztecs: fuck that noise. Let's just look at a passage from my favorite recent historical read, *1491* by Charles C. Mann: \n\n&gt;Who today would want to live in the Greece of Plato and Socrates, with its slavery, constant warfare, institutionalized pederasty, and relentless culling os surplus population? Yet Athens had a coruscating tradition of rhetoric, lyric drama, and philosophy. So did Tenochtitlan and the other cities of the Triple Alliance. In fact, the corpus of writings in classical Nahuatl, the language of the Alliance, is even greater than the corpus of texts in classical Greek. (137)\n\nSo, the claim that Shakespeare was more articulate than the Aztecs as a *whole people* is horribly ignorant and ethnocentric. I wouldn't even call Shakespeare particularly articulate by European standards. Let me just say: Lope de Vega, Calderón de la Barca, Gil Vicente, Góngora, and Quevedo. Jonathan should be careful: his Anglocentrism is showing. \n\n&gt;Ancient American civilisations that used visual symbols as a language were oddly similar to Egypt in their mixture of grandeur and stasis. The Maya carved beautiful language icons, yet never developed metalwork, let alone tragic drama. \n\nA brief linguistic tangent: I like how Jonathan implies that the English alphabet's letters are *not* visual symbols. Obviously we read by smell, not by sight. But seriously though, this guy has approximately *ALL the ethnocentrism*. \n\nHere's my historical rebuttal: I would go so far as to say that ancient American civilizations were likely *more grand* than Egypt, since they were *at least as good and probably superior to* European civilizations of the same time, and were conquered due to a genetic quirk in their immune system (according to Mann). I've already discussed how the idea of static history is moronic. What else? Oh, yes, I love how he throws the Maya a bone by saying how they created \"beautiful language icons, yet never developed metalwork, let alone tragic drama\". What does metalwork have to do with literary culture? Absolutely nothing! Jonathan's just throwing around every eurocentric's trump card for the idea of pre-colonial American society's potential equal/superior status in comparison to Europe. \"They couldn't even smelt iron!\" they cry. Let's see what Mann has to say on the subject: \n\n&gt;In the late 1960s, Heather Lechtman, an archaeologist at the MIT Center for Materials Research in Archaeology and Ethnology, suggested to \"an eminent scholar of Andean prehistory that we take a serious and careful look at Andean metallurgy\". He responded, \"But there wasn't any.\" Lechtman went and looked anyway. She discovered that Inka metallurgy was, in fact, as refined as European metallurgy, but that it had such different goals that academic experts had failed to recognize it. \n\n&gt;According to Lechtman, Europeans sought to optimize metals' \"hardness, strength, toughness, and sharpness\". The Inka, by contrast, valued \"plasticity, malleability, and toughness\". Europeans used metal for tools. Andean societies primarily used it as a token of wealth, power, and community affiliation . . . .\n\n&gt; Andean cultures did make tools, of course. But rather than making them out of steel, they preferred fiber. The choice is less odd than it may seem. Mechanical engineering depends on two forces: compression and tension. Both are employed in European technology, but the former is more common–the arch is a classical example of compression. By contrast, tension was the Inka way. (94-95)\n\nSo, not only did a pre-Colombian American society have metallurgy, but *it was just as good* as that of European metallurgy; it was simply used in a different way. Ancient Americans also had cultural traditions that, while they may not have been *exactly* like European or classical Greek tragic drama, were certainly equally valuable. What else does Jonathan say? Not much.\n\n&gt;There really is strong evidence that the abstract written word is essential to advance ideas, poetry and argument to their highest levels.\n\nWay to go, Jonathan, assuming that an alphabet is necessary for \"abstract written words\"! But Jonathan completely gloss over the notion that the pre-Colombian Americans *had* advanced ideas, poetry and rhetoric with both non-alphabetic writing *and* a rich oral tradition. As for the claim of the existence of \"really strong evidence\", I never take that as an argument. If there is \"really strong evidence\", why don't you throw some my way? Claiming the existence of *strong evidence* without giving me any doesn't let me judge the strength of the evidence by myself; it's a fucking insult to my intelligence. As for the lack of evidence regarding precolonial literary culture, I can explain that easily: the Europeans *fucking destroyed it* to more easily impose \"superior\" European culture on indigenous subjects. \n\n&gt;Speak Emoji if you want. I’ll stick with the language of Shakespeare.\n\nI didn't ask your opinion of my text messages' literary value, you ethnocentric, presentist, ig'nant little bitch. I'm going to hang out with cool people who don't cite Shakespeare as the pinnacle of linguistic development. Peace. ;)\n\nSpecial shoutouts to /u/Abargall who responded to a comment I made a while back with the paper I linked to (\"Alphabetism in Reading Science\") and to /u/Numendil from /r/badlinguistics, who came up with the idea to cross-post Jonathan's article.

The documentary itself isn't bad, I didn't really watch it, but the comments, oh boy, the comments. We've already covered it over at [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/ShitWehraboosSay/comments/37a0y2/this_shitpost_from_documentaries_the_victorious/) /r/ShitWehraboosSay thread (which got brigaded like a mofo) but why let them have all the fun? Lets share the trashiness with everyone!\n\nLets start [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/379ipl/1945_the_savage_peace_2015_bbc_the_largest_ethnic/crl5nj1)\n\n&gt;What happened in Germany after WW-II has happened after every war ever. As it is the victors who write the history books, it is also something you see ignored after every war ever.\n\nVictor, are you writing the history books again? The Soviet/allied warcrimes aren't \"ignored\", of course the irony of saying this in a fucking thread featuring a BBC documentary about said warcrimes is palpable, but goes over this shit poster's head.\n\nPoster right after says this:\n\n&gt;So many soviets died because the soviets did not care a whit for the lives of their own soldiers, and were led by a mental retard.\n\nStalin's armies conquered half of Europe and he turned the Soviet Union from an agrarian country into a world super power, but yes, he's the idiot. The rest of the comment is the usual Wehraboo claptrap about \"Asiatic hordes\" being thrown at the Germans with no mind for tactics or strategy. \n\nThen we encounter [this chucklefuck](http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/379ipl/1945_the_savage_peace_2015_bbc_the_largest_ethnic/crl7bc0)\n\n&gt;Germany tried to break away from the Rothschild banking cartel (which was growing rich at the expense of the Germans) and nationalized the German banks... It wasn't just Germany that was raped by the Allies, countless French and Italian civilians were raped and murdered by Americans, not to mention the millions of Eastern Europeans killed by the Soviets. Zionist Jews leapt on this opportunity with the claim that six million Jews had been systemically exterminated by the Germans.\n\nI'm not quoting the whole comment, because its just a long series of antisemitic rants one expects from /r/conspiracy. Needless to say, there are numerous issues with this comment. Its just straight up victim blaming holocaust denial, the Jews were only rounded up and sent to labour camps, Rothchilds. He tries to pull the \"Hitler wanted peace\" card, ignoring that if Hitler wanted peace, he probably should have avoided invading Poland. The young, plucky Neo-Nazis proceeds cites that fucking stupid ass documentary \"Hellstorm\" which is about the \"allied genocide in Germany.\" \n\nHe continues in later comments:\n\n&gt;There were atrocities committed by German forces. To say that German forces were always completely kind to the Slavs would be a lie. To say that the treatment the Slavs received from the Germans was comparable to the Soviets would be an even bigger lie. The crimes of the Germans were on committed by individual soldiers in the 'spur of the moment'. The crimes of the Soviets were engineered to bring horrors to those unfortunate enough to feel their wrath. The Holodomor is a good example of this.\n\nYes, what the Soviets did to the Ukrainians and others was awful. Germans funded organizations in the Baltics and Ukraine to encourage anti-Soviet sentiment, they even went as far as releasing Ukranian POWs as a sign of good faith with the Ukrainian people. Yet, no independent Ukraine was set up (even though it was recommended by members of the Wehrmacht) and the Ukrainians were to have their numbers massively reduced under Generalplan ost like the other slavs, around 65% of the Ukrainian population was to be removed to make way for German settlers. So yeah, the Germans were more than \"comparable\" to the Soviets. \n\n&gt;So why can no one actually find the orders signed by Hitler calling for mistreatment towards the Slavs?\n\n&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;\n\nMoving on:\n\n&gt; Makes you wonder, were they just as bad as the nazis?\n\nNo, it really doesn't. \n\nMoving onto a new neo-Nazi we get [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/379ipl/1945_the_savage_peace_2015_bbc_the_largest_ethnic/crl2l2b)\n\n&gt;Germany didn't start WW1.\n\n&gt;They literally weren't any part of it. What is with the weird insistence on ignoring well documented history?\n\nNuance is the first casualty in war. Even if Germany didn't start the war, they certainly played a huge role in making it a world war. \n\nAnd yes this guy is in fact a Nazi apologist. Let's see his opinion on Askhistorians:\n\n&gt;The askhistorians and history subs are not moderated by experts. They are moderated by lunatics with a crazy obsession with controlling what people see. I've seriously seen them delete factually correct posts with citations from the US holocaust memorial museum calling it \"holocaust denial\".\n\nAlright, last post from [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/379ipl/1945_the_savage_peace_2015_bbc_the_largest_ethnic/crl0apb) wanna be Hitlerite:\n\n&gt;it was literally the excuse England used to start the war. The treaty took a big ass chunk of Germany and gave it to Poland. And then when Germany wanted to negotiate to get it back, England and France told Poland \"say no so they try to take it by force, and we'll come destroy them for you\".\n\nThis is literally swallowing the Neo-Nazi koolaid. You know else the Germans \"negotiated\" with? The Czechoslovakians, ask them how well bowing to Nazi Germany went. Hitler invited the president of Czechoslovakia and literally threatened him into accepting German domination over the entire country. \n\nNow I promised colonial apologism, and we shall deliver. \n\nSomeone tries to get a nice game of genocide Olympics and Amerikkka bashing going on:\n\n&gt;Pretty sure more Native Americans were killed. Just sayin...\n\nWhich is responded to with:\n\n&gt;Not our fault we were all developing civilizations and technology and they were all over there just content poking each other with sticks for 10k years.\n\nNative Americans were just poking each other with sticks, that was the entirety of their history. /u/elos_ sums it up nicely:\n\n&gt;Yeah modernized systems of government including democratic systems, aqueducts, sewage systems, pyramids, bustling urban regions, internal and external trade systems, advanced agricultural tools and systems, and stone roads! \"Savages\"!\n\nThat doesn't stop him though, he's dying on this hill:\n\n&gt;No.. Pretty much everyone in Europe and Asia, even some parts of South America, Northern Africa had an advanced civilization compared to Northern American Indians and Africans. That just sat there with their dicks in their hands doing nothing more than surviving. Never striving for more. They're just as fucking lazy now too.\n\n",

        "text": "So I happened to notice that one of the top posts on /AH/ right now is about the Japanese objectives in attacking the US in World War II.  [See here.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3773pm/what_was_the_japanese_objective_against_the_us_in/) This is always a valid question to ask, especially since a) one must wonder for what possible reason you'd want to be at war with a vengeful world megapower and b) it is Memorial Day in the States, so military questions are popular today.\n\nHowever, I took a look at the top answer and was none too happy.  I'll break it down.\n\n&gt;Japan's goal was not the conquest of America or to annex American territory or anything of the sort, instead Japan wanted America to accept their \"special interests\" in China, basically, give them a free hand to do what they want. \n\nThis sounds suspiciously like the logic of Japanese revisionists that claim that Japan's involvement in China was simply mimicking the imperial ambitions of the European powers in China.  Which is funny because before the 1930s the Japanese policies in China were far more in line with those of the European powers (treaty ports, control of the railroads, drug dealing, general dickery), whereas after 1930s we had a nutjob annexing all of Manchuria pretty much unilaterally, constant border skirmishes, ethnic cleansing on both sides, and finally full blown war in 1937.   \n\n&gt;Now, Japan was at war with China since 1937 and had conquered most of China's major cities but hadn't quite been able to force the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-Shek to surrender. \n\n[Here's a map of Japanese \"control\" in China as of late 1940.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Second_Sino-Japanese_War_WW2.png) Simply put, Japan was in no way close to defeating the Nationalists as this line implies.  Even with the Nationalists doing some really, really stupid things, like sending their best troops into an urban grindfest at Shanghai, to blowing up a dam and intentionally flooding massively populated areas, the Japanese had somehow managed to outdo this in sheer military incompetence, such to the point that after 4 years of total war they were stalemated against a constantly mobilizing Chinese force. \n\n&gt;America wasn't happy about this, and combined with early international incidents like annexing Korea, installing a Japanese-controlled regime in Manchuria, withdrawing from the League of Nations, and sinking the US gunboat Panay, it led to the US embargoing Japan, and cutting off their supply of oil in July 1941.\n\nActually, the real kick in the nuts by the Japanese was that they unilaterally seized Indochina from the French by force.  The Allied embargo wasn't directly because of the high amount of pro-China feeling and the powerful China lobby, it was because they wanted to create a deterrent to prevent Japan from deciding it could unilaterally seize other peoples' colonial possessions.  \n\n&gt;Japan knew that once they went through their oil reserves, their war with China would come to a halt because they had very little in the way of natural oil resources. \n\nActually, the biggest impediment for the Japanese war machine was the scrap metal embargo.  People seem to buy into this narrative that every single war is about oil.  Japan true enough was running out of oil-they had a war stockpile of about 2 years left.  However, they had only about 1 more year of scrap metal, which was necessary for important war needs like making bullets and shells and cans for food.  What the hell were they going to use oil for in China anyways?  The terrain was terrible for armor (which wasn't really a key portion of Japanese land doctrine in the first place) and Japan's aviation deployed in China was a relatively minor portion of her overall air assets.  If anything, oil was necessary for her naval units, but even the almighty Yamato wouldn't be able to get to Chongqing.\n\n&gt;There was view among the militarists that Japan should go to war against the west and conquer Southeast Asia for their rich resources (most notably oil and rubber) and force the Americans to accept Japan's position as the leader of Asia. They thought it was better to go to war now because the longer time goes on, the stronger the Americans will become.\n\nThis part I don't really have anything against, other than there were also Japanese militarists that thought they could also expand north into Siberia, at least until they tried it and got whooped by the Red Army.  You'd think they would've learned about going to war against a stronger power.\n\n&gt;Admiral Yamamoto came up with the Pearl Harbor attack plan, he, unlike most in the Japanese high command, quite soberly realized that Japan had little chance of winning a long war against the US... \n\nActually, most people in the Japanese high command realized that Japan couldn't win a long war against the US.  Including Nagumo, who he will beat up below.  That was part of the reason why Japan's entire war plan was to avoid a long war with the US.\n\n&gt;...he thought the Pearl Harbor attack was their best chance, and if he could sink the entire US fleet and destroy the various facilities at Pearl Harbor like the fuel stores and submarine harbors, he was prepared to accept losing even two or three carriers. \n\nOh boy, this shit.  [Order No. 1](https://books.google.com/books?id=GrsWE5rcRtkC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Annex+3+of+Operation+Order+No.+1+pearl+harbor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zfLwHRlhLq&amp;sig=upow04OtxSFqz1sUwSygehV2bLQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vtRjVb3lEon4gwSppIPAAw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Annex%203%20of%20Operation%20Order%20No.%201%20pearl%20harbor&amp;f=false) explicitly states that the priorities for the Pearl Harbor attack were, in order:\n\nAirfields (to suppress enemy interceptors)\n\nAircraft carriers (also to suppress enemy interceptors)\n\nBattleships\n\nCruisers\n\nMerchant Shipping\n\nPort Facilities\n\nLand Installations\n\nIn other words, Yamamoto thought that attacking a transport ship was more important than hitting fuel tanks or submarine harbors.  Yep.  \n\n\n&gt;The sneak attack is a well-admired tactic in Japanese culture, and Japan used a similar sneak attack to great effect in the Russo-Japanese war, sinking the Russian pacific fleet at Port Arthur. \n\nI'm going to ignore this remark, because aside from the fact that the so-called sneak attack at Port Arthur, only damaged two ships, saying that because the Japanese launched a sneak attack several times means that they love sneak attacks is like saying Americans love sneak attacks because Washington crossed the Delaware to surprise the Hessians at Trenton.\n\n&gt;Yamamoto hoped that one devastating blow would cripple the US, and give Japan about 18 months before the US fleet recovered and America's industrial strength made them unstoppable. During that time, Japan hoped that they could inflict a severe enough of a defeat that America would be willing to come to the bargaining table and accept Japan as the leader of Asia.\n\nJapan's entire doctrine during this initial build up period was to capture a large defensive perimeter, using island air bases as unsinkable aircraft carriers.  The idea was that by capturing these areas, when the inevitable mega US counterattack came, the Japanese would be able to use these island airbases to support land-based aircraft that would allow them to contest American air superiority and allow the Japanese to engage in the so-called Mahanian \"Decisive Battle.\"  This victory was then supposed to get the Allies to come to the negotiation table, but under no reasonable negotiation would the Japanese be recognized as a \"leader of Asia.\"  \n\n&gt;Unfortunately for Japan, the admiral who led the actual attack, Admiral Nagumo, was very timid and skeptical of the value of aircraft carriers and called off the attack too quickly before it could destroy the fuel stores or some of the cruisers and other ships in the harbor. This led some Americans such as Admiral King to wonder why the Japanese abandoned the attack when they were on the cusp of victory. \n\nIf there's one Japanese officer I feel sorry for, it's Admiral Chuichi Nagumo.  All of Nagumo's successes are attributed to Yamamoto, and all of Yamamoto's failings are attributed to Nagumo.  The poor guy, despite being essentially undefeated for 6 months and smashing Allied fleets and air units throughout the Pacific, loses all credibility after Midway and gets the honor of killing himself as Saipan fell to the US.  \n\nNagumo was a battleship specialist.  But that wasn't his fault.  The entire IJN officer line, including Monsieur Yamamoto, were battleship specialists.  That was what the IJN had been indoctrinated in since the interwar period.  The only ones I would characterize as carrier experts were Tamon Yamaguchi and Jisaburo Ozawa, and Yamaguchi's most known feat was leading his one carrier against all three of the Allies at Midway, while Ozawa had the thankless task of leading the \"bait force\" at Leyte Gulf.  To think that putting Yamamoto in direct command of Japan's carrier force, Kido Butai, would have resulted in a third strike or a different priority of strikes, is ridiculous.\n\nIn addition, people who ask why Japan didn't launch a third strike often forget that there are 24 hours in a day.  Nobody in 1941 had trained in night time carrier operations.  Any \"third strike' would have been launched by 3pm, during which not only would US defenders be on full alert (with anti-air crews and fighters on combat air patrol), but would also need to be retrieved by the carriers some hours later at night.  This would likely lead to the loss of nearly every plane launched on that third strike, because the IJN had no training in dusk carrier operations.  This is assuming they even did any damage.  And every pilot that the Japanese lost at this point was irreplacable, because the Japanese air training routine was designed to intentionally fail almost all the candidates to create an \"elite\" force.  Any elite pilots lost would take years to replace, as we saw throughout the Solomons campaign, leading to the \"Great Turkey Shoot\" in 1944, where the Japanese ended up sending green pilots against US veteran aviators.  \n\nSo with all the risks (in addition of course to other US forces responding and finding the Japanese carriers during this time) we have to weigh the benefits of targeting what were seen by Yamamoto as being less valuable than merchant shipping (which incidentally was low enough that even submarines were told to save their ammunition for warships).  Any admiral in that position, least of all Yamamoto, would've packed his shit up and gone home.  So blaming Nagumo here is silly.\n\n&gt;As a result, America was not grievously wounded, and by mid-1942, strong enough to defeat Japan decisively at Midway.\n\nEven if the Japanese had somehow developed a nuke and set it off in the middle of Pearl Harbor, it wouldn't have affected American combat strength in the Pacific.  Even if the entire US fleet had been lost at Midway for no Japanese casualties, it wouldn't have stopped the US.  [Parshall and Tully say it best:](http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm)\n\n&gt;In other words, even if it had lost catastrophically at the Battle of Midway, the United States Navy still would have broken even with Japan in carriers and naval air power by about September 1943. Nine months later, by the middle of 1944, the U.S. Navy would have enjoyed a nearly two-to-one superiority in carrier aircraft capacity! Not only that, but with her newer, better aircraft designs, the U.S. Navy would have enjoyed not only a substantial numeric, but also a critical qualitative advantage as well, starting in late 1943. \n\nAmen.\n\n&gt;So, TL, DR: Japan's goal was to force the US to accept China as Japanese territory.\n\nAnd the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, and Malaya, and Indochina, and Burma, and the random islands scattered here and there, oh, and it wasn't like Japan wanted to preemptively stop the Americans from intercepting their supply route from the Dutch East Indies back to the Home Islands or anything.\n\nI honestly think that the US has a twisted view of Yamamoto.  Its as if there's this need to create an omniescent anachronistic figure using every trick of war to launch a \"surprise attack\" and a \"day of infamy\" on the United States.  They went out of their way to assassinate him, for fuck's sake!  \n\nThey seem to ignore Yamamoto's many mistakes too.  The entire build-up to and the actual Midway operation were total clusterfucks that would cause Togo to spin in his grave, they ignore Yamamoto's complete bungling of Guadalacanal, and they also ignore the fact that the man was a stubborn mule who essentially operated by threatening to resign if he didn't have his way.  This man would be a terrible person to have in any organization, yet the IJN was perverse enough that this was actually beneficial to doing business there!  Sure, the man was a decent naval commander, but he was hardly some special uber admiral.\n\nTLDR: Yamamoto's torpedoes literally smell like roses\n\nSources:\n\nParshing and Tully, Shattered Sword, et. other resources\n\nEvans, Kaigun\n\n",
