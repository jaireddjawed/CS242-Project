        "text": "This post might be somewhat out of line here, but I thought I'd make it and see if it sticks.\n\n[TIL that Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog of Hades in Greek mythology, takes his name from the Greek word \"kerberos\". Kerberos means \"spotted\", which means Hades literally named his dog \"Spot\".](http://www.np.reddit.com//r/todayilearned/comments/2falgz/til_that_cerberus_the_threeheaded_guard_dog_of/)\n\nThe basic premise here is, of course, questionable - \"Kerberos\" is *not* \"literally\" \"Spot.\" But that's actually not what I'm interested in.\n\nThere's also a lot of [interpretation of Hades as a \"total dork\" and \"4chan,\"](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2falgz/til_that_cerberus_the_threeheaded_guard_dog_of/ck7fjzm) and that's, in my opinion, a pretty bad piece of mythology, but that's not what I'm interested in either.\n\nWhat bothered me was the unanimous decision that, because of the reference to spots, Cerberus was based on hyenas.\n\nThis is not a line of thought I am familiar with. What I am familiar with is the theory that the [crocotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocotta) is based on hyenas, for a number of fairly direct and integral reasons - the imitation of human laughter, the geographical basis, the natural antagonism, etc. More than merely \"spotted.\" \n\nI mean, come on, Cerberus had three heads, tail and mane of serpents, and feet of a lion. What about that screams \"hyena\" to you?\n\nBut various people in that thread take that assumption as a fact.\n\n&gt;Can we also conclude that Cerberus was a spotted dog too?\n\n&gt;&gt;Well the basis for Cerberus is believed to be a Hyena wich are naturally spotted.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If Cerberus was a spotted hyena then there is also a chance that Cerberus was female and nobody knew. Female spotted hyenas have super long clits that looks like a pseudo penis and a swollen labia that looks like balls. For an incredibly long time it was thought there were no female spotted hyenas as a result.\n\nOkay, wow. That second comment, I'm just not sure where that's coming from - who believes it to be? And then that third comment - haha, wow. I just don't even know. Completely shoe-horned in there. Obscene and irrelevant \"fact\" to add to this Cerberus-hyena hypothesis.\n\nSomeone else quotes the wiki to call this TIL into question. This leads to the second instance of this idea.\n\n&gt;\"The name \"Cerberus\" is a Latinised version of the Greek Kerberos. The etymology of this name prior to Greek is disputed. It has been claimed to be related to the Sanskrit word सर्वरा sarvarā, used as an epithet of one of the dogs of Yama, from a Proto-Indo-European word *k̑érberos, meaning \"spotted\"[18] (This etymology suffers from the fact that it includes a reconstructed *b, which is extremely rare in Proto-Indo-European. Yet according to Julius Pokorny it is well distributed, with additional apparent cognates in Slavic, British and Lithuanian.[19]) The use of a dog is uncertain,[20][21] although mythologists have speculated that the association was first made in the city of Trikarenos in Phliasia.[22] Bruce Lincoln (1991),[23] among others, critiques this etymology; and Ogden (2013)[24] refers to it as \"dismissed\"\" \n\n&gt;TLDR: Maybe, maybe not\n\n&gt;&gt;Just an off the top my head thought; since the word means \"Spotted\", and it's a \"dog\"...would it be possible for the people who originated the myth to have known hyenas or something similar?\n\nOkay, so, sure, maybe, since it's just the top of your head, and just asking if it's *possible,* sure, you're not doing anything wrong, you're just having fun speculating.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sounds like a fair theory. The Greek definitely could've heard of/seen hyena's. They knew about lions although those lived close to or even in Greece around that time IIRC. Still, the Greeks knew a lot about the world, so hyena's is definitely an option\n\nWhat? Really? That's all it takes to convince you? And what's this about lions? Are we just blindly equivocating these mammals and assuming the ancients did so as well?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As they're often known to be carrion eaters (despite being quite able hunters), I could see hyenas being associated with hades and the underworld in general.\n\nThese comments aren't offensive or anything, they just commit non-critically to this idea they've had that Cerberus=spotted=hyena because Greeks=knew about lions. \n\nThere's the suggestion of bad mythology here because in many ways, Hades wasn't associated with \"carrion\" or what have you; he was more associated with rich bounty than with roadkill.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah it's quite fitting. And weren't hyena's considered dogs or at least very doglike at the time? So maybe the same word. Or the word: spotted. Cerberus.\n\nHaha, yup, there we go. In conclusion: spotted. Cerberus.\n\nThat's how reddit does mythology.\n\nAgain, the evidence here for Cerberus being a mythological depiction of a hyena is... spotty, at best. Especially when we have relatively convincing depictions like the Crocotta to point to instead.\n\n-----\n\n&gt;Well, either way, it's pronounced \"Ker\" and not \"Ser.\" Just an FYI to everyone. (Also, it's Kelts, not Selts. Sorry, Boston!)\n\nLook at this guy, knows the romans used a hard C, and now inserts that piece of knowledge into every possible mention of a roman \"C.\" This bugs me because typically when english-speakers use these words we are speaking english, and not ancient Latin, so pronouncing Cicero \"Kikero\" isn't actually following the rules, and it sure as hell isn't communicating effectively.\n\n-----\n\nI hope this is historical enough to suit you guys. If not I totally understand. I just love it when redditors decide to speculate on something with no intellectual background whatsoever, and then in four comments they turn a theory into a confirmed fact, and in the next comment thread it's suddenly \"widely believed to be the case.\"\n\n",

        "text": "First the offending source of the badhistory, which I found on a local gun forum I frequent. Which, like all gun forums, has it's share of crazy right wingers and conspiritards \n\n\"Labor Day's origins come from an anti-capitalist protest that included shootouts, dynamite throwing and the destruction of neighborhoods. Every year on the anniversary of that protest college students celebrate by lighting shit on fire for reasons they do not understand. \n\nLearn your American history. \n\nhttp://likeomggunsareforlosers.blogspot.com/2014/09/labor-day-rooted-in-communism.html?m=1\"\n\nNow I laughed at the \"Learn your American history\" of the OP, and knew right away Volcano had blessed me with some delicious BadHistory(TM).\n\nThe poorly written and sourced blog, asserts that Labor Day celebrations in the US are rooted in the bombings and violence associated with the [Haymarket Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair).  Which in turn, is twisted to mean that Labor Day is a celebration of wild eyed bomb throwing anarchists, violent anti capitalists and ignorant, violent college students.  \n\nA pity that [the real history](http://www.dol.gov/laborday/history.htm) is a bit less [sensational](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/01/labor-day-2014_n_5738262.html) and [explosive](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/history-labor-day-forgotten-article-1.1923299).  By the time Federal Labor Day legislation was passed in 1894, local Labor Day celebrations were already a thing. The disaffected labor movement wanted their work to be honored and remembered, and had long demanded a day of recognition. After the crippling and typically violent for the era Pullman Strikes of 1894, Congress passed a Labor Day act, likely as partial appeasement to the angry labor community.  \n\nBut Haymarket? Absolutely nothing to do with it. Labor Day was not designed or timed around Haymarket, nor does it exist in memory of the demonstration. I have no bloody clue how anyone could connect the two, except by broadly tying all 19th century labor agitation together under the scary red roof of Communism and Socialism, and thus make the claim that anything related to 19th century labor comes back to wild eyed bomb throwing anarchists.  \n",

        "text": "So, I'm not a history buff or anything, but I am subscribed to this subreddit and r/AskHistorians, and I was curious whether the Dred Scott decision was considered the correct interpretation of the law as it existed before the Thirteenth Amendment. And the answer I got was, no, it's total garbage, and not just because it's a horribly racist decision with a six-digit body count. In fact, as I discovered, Chief Justice Roger Taney's majority opinion in the Dred Scott case is itself bad history, in every sense. \n\nSo I thought it'd be fun to bring it over to r/badhistory just like it was written by some dumbass Internet crank; honestly, if you presented it without telling me what it was, I'd assume it was from a Fox News commenter or something. I'm mostly cribbing from [this article](http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1801&amp;context=fss_papers), but let me sum up:\n\nFirst off, Taney says that \"It is too clear for dispute that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included\" in the Declaration of Independence's statement that all men are created equal. Too clear to dispute!! Never mind that Jefferson wrote some of the fiercest anti-slavery rhetoric of his era and that many of the Founding Fathers were on record disapproving of slavery! But check out his reasoning:\n\n&gt; ...for if the language, as understood in that day, would embrace [blacks], the conduct of the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence would have been utterly and flagrantly inconsistent with the principles they asserted; and instead of the sympathy of mankind, to which they so confidently appealed, they would have deserved and received universal rebuke and reprobation. \n\nThis is *hilariously* wrong. No duh the Founding Fathers were inconsistent; they said as much! Taney either believed or expected the country to believe that nobody would be praised if their principles were as obviously inconsistent as the Founding Fathers were. I guess the term \"cognitive dissonance\" wasn't around yet in the 1850s, but even so, it seems like he should have considered the possibility that *maybe people will whitewash or forgive inconsistencies in people they admire.* I'm not a historian, but I don't see how that could have been that foreign of a concept. \n\nOr here's this little number:\n\n&gt;The unhappy black race were separated from the white by indelible marks, and laws long before established, and were never thought of or spoken of except as property, and when the claims of the owner or the profit of the trader were supposed to need protection. \n\nBullshit! Many states had free blacks who had full citizenship and voting rights, right at the start of the Articles of Confederation. This is complete and utter hogwash, and it came from the most influential legal mind in America! This *astonishes* me! \n\nAnd I'm no legal scholar and that article is kind of dense, but Taney apparently also said that the Constitution was not intended to give the federal government authority over new territories. And that's not only wrong from a legal standpoint (if not the federal government then who??), it's also completely historically inaccurate as the original founders exercised federal authority over territories all the time, right from the very beginning; the Continental Congress banned slavery in the Northwest Territory under the Articles of Confederation, and frequently reaffirmed by subsequent Congresses.\n\nAgain, I'm neither a historian nor a lawyer so if I'm getting this wrong please let me know. And obviously, the Dred Scott decision is not some sacred cow that needs deflating, I don't think anyone today believes any of it. But still I'm amazed at how just blatantly *wrong* most of this is. Even that dense legal article uses words like \"silliness\" and \"comical\" when describing it. It's like finding out that we once elected a president that believed two and two equaled five!",

        "text": "So I posted this a month ago but the communazi mods kindly reminded me of the moratorium so I figured I'd wait to repost it.\n\nRecently I was looking through some old boxes full of books in my basement. I came to the box full of political books when one particular tome caught my eye: \"What's So Great About America\" by Dinesh D'Souza. I had read D'Souza's work  before and I knew what to expect so I numbly flipped through the pages to see the chapter names when a particular name  caught me off guard: Two Cheers for Colonialism. I read the first five pages got sickened and put it down with the intent of never lifting that book again. Alas my boredom has gotten the better of me so I sojourned into this wonderful pile of imperial apologia that is ironically enough written by an Indian-American! I'll try to leave out his criticisms of the modern schooling system (he basically just goes on rants about how American students are taught to hate America and the West/Western culture) and other tangents into modern politics as that might break R2 and some of what I criticize may be better suited for /r/badanthropology but I think it still fits here. So without further delay let's get to the bad history!\n\n\nAfter introducing the subject and the chapter D'Souza discusses a quote by the novelist Saul Bellow:\n\n&gt;\"Show me the Proust of the Papuans, the Tolstoy of the Zulus, and I will read him\"... Bellow's sin was to imply that Western culture, might have contributed more to the dining table of civilization than others.\n\nD'Souza's point here is that these particular cultures haven't contributed to the tapestry of tales from around the world however he conveniently ignores not only [Zulu literature](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/8275/African-literature/57058/Zulu) but the rich oral traditions from both Zulu culture and the countless cultures of New Guinea which can have just as much merit as Tolstoy's work.\n\nD'Souza then discusses a meeting of a historical society that he attended in the early 90's in which those present were debating whether Columbus \"discovered\" or \"encountered\" the Americas.\n\n&gt;The historians who objected to the term \"discovery\" were trying to camouflage the fact that it was Columbus and his ships that ventured out and landed on the shores of the Americas, and not American Indians who landed on the shores of Europe.\n\nTo be perfectly honest I'm not sure what D'Souza's point is here. I think he's trying to say that because it  was Colombus' expeditions which marked the beginning of regular contact between Europe and the Americas and not the other way around European society is better but even if that is his point he's still wrong in his rejection to the term \"discovered\" as the vikings had established a [settlement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Anse_aux_Meadows) in Newfoundland centuries before (and of course were ignoring the Native Americans themselves).\n\nHe then discusses how some cultures are more advanced than others and he drops this little nugget (which isn't bad history per say, but I couldn't resist putting it in here, if the mods feel it's an R2 violation then I'll gladly remove it):\n\n&gt;There is simply no comparison between, say, the per capita income of Europe and America and that of the nations of  sub-Saharan Africa. If sub-Saharan Africa were to sink into the ocean tomorrow, the world economy would be largely unaffected.\n\nTIL that sub-Saharan Africa has no importance in the modern economy at all.\n\nThe next part is a lovely defense of a Eurocentric curriculum:\n\n&gt;But of course if we are trying to describe the world in which we live, indeed the modern world of the past few centuries, then it is entirely accurate to focus on Europe, to place Western civilization at the center. Indeed it was the West, expanding outward which found and conquered and defined the rest of the world.\n\nApparently the rest of the world was just sitting around and being all isolated until the West came and discovered it. It is utterly absurd to focus solely on Europe. If we want to understand the modern world then we need to understand the histories of the other nations which occupy and play a large role in it. In addition only focusing on European and post-European contact history gives us an incomplete thread of the elaborate tapestry that is human history and you fail to learn of the contributions that countless other societies have made. Also apparently other nations never explored and conquered [far](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He) [off](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire) [lands](http://fanack.com/uploads/pics/oman_empire_map1.jpg).\n\n&gt;Within the West, admittedly, the center of power has shifted. Inside the competing orbit of the West, the Portuguese first had the upper hand, hen the Spanish, then the French, and then the English.\n\nIgnoring the gross oversimplifications, according to D'Souza the Dutch don't real.\n\nFunnily enough (and to his credit even though he just gave a stern defense for Eurocentrism) D'Souza then lists some of the great civilizations from non-Europe parts of the world even referencing Sudanic kingdoms such as Mali and Songhay. However he does refer to the Islamic world around the year 1500 as though it was a single empire which spanned three continents when this was certainly no longer the case. \n\nBonus: At least two uses of the term \"Dark Ages\" when describing Medieval Europe\n\nD'Souza then lists (what he apparently considers to be at least) the only two mainstream theories for the West's success as \"Opression Theory\" (The idea that the West is doing well ONLY because it stole from the rest of the world) and the \"Environmental Theory\" (You might be more familiar with it by the  name of Geographic Determenism). This of course ignores the many complex realities that scholars attribute to the ascendancy of the West.\n\nWe are then privy to a rant about how slavery, ethnocentrism and colonialism are not unique to Western society. D'Souza also doesn't seem to be able to distinguish between [Imperialism](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS595US595&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=imperialism) and [Colonialism](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS595US595&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=colonialism). He compares Western colonialism to the Persian Empire (which is odd because I don't recall reading about how when the Persians conquered Egypt they set the entire population to work as slaves in gold mines or displaced those native to the region with their own), the Macedonian Empire (which apparently doesn't count as Western even though he refers to the ancient Greeks as Western on numerous occasions) and the Chinese empire (of which there was apparently only one). Then when D'Souza is talking about slavery we get this delightful drek:\n\n&gt;If slavery is not distinctively Western, what is? The movement to end slavery!...Never in the history of the world, outside of the West, has a group of people eligible to be slave owners mobilized against the institution of slavery.\n\nThis is a great observation except for pesky things like the fact that the Japanese outlawed slavery in the late 16th century, the Koreans in the late 19th century (with possible Japanese influence), the Chinese Emperor Wang Mang did so during his reign in the 1st century ce, the Ming Dynasty officially banned it (although it did continue), there was an  attempt made to abolish slavery in Ethiopia in the 1850's and so on. But D'Souza doesn't stop there!\n\n&gt;The descendants of African slaves owe their freedom to the exertions of white strangers...\n\nI had no idea that free blacks had no part in the abolitionist movement whatsoever! Who is Frederick Douglas again?\n\nD'Souza uses this discussion of black people to transition into a defense of colonialism by relaying a Muhammad Ali quote:\n\n&gt;...Ali was asked by a reporter, \"Champ, what did you think of Africa?\" Ali replied, \"Thank God m granddaddy got on that  boat!\"\n\nWe are subsequently subject to an anecdote about D'Souza's grandfathers views of the white man and D'Souza comes up with the following conclusion as to why he didn't share his grandfathers negative views towards the West:\n\n&gt;...colonialism had injured those who lived under it, but paradoxically it proved beneficial to their descendants.\"\n\nI'm absolutely positive that he is not distinguishing between colonialism and imperialism so from this point on neither will I. On that note, I'm sure that the Australian Aborigines and Native Americans are doing far better as a result of colonialism than if they had established relatively peaceful contacts with the West. I'm also sure that the DRC, Nigeria and Sudan have no issues which might even be remotely attributable to colonialism. This is of course not to say that the effects of colonialism (and of course imperialism) were universally negative for the natives of every land that was affected by the two however there are enough instances of it being a negative force for the majority of natives in many regions.\n\nTo D'Souza's credit he does acknowledge that the Europeans weren't in it for he benefits of the native populations and that they most certainly did do some bad things but he seems to excuse all of the misery caused by colonialism due to the fact that the European powers provided places like India with infrastructure and introduced their legal systems as well as ideas like liberty (which  apparently didn't exist in the rest of the world before the enlightened Europeans showed up).\n\nAfter some stuff about how the descendants of slaves in the USA should be grateful that their ancestors were enslaved (lest they have to live in Africa) we get this interesting denial:\n\n&gt;It makes no sense to claim that the West grew rich and powerful by taking everybody else's stuff for a simple reason : there wasn't very much to take.\n\nHe defends this remark by pointing out that Europeans introduced tea to India, rubber to Malaysia and cocoa to West Africa and if tea rubber and cocoa were the only ways in which the Europeans economically exploited these places then his remarks would be justifiable unfortunately this was not the case as the Europeans did in fact take native resources from many areas under their control (Also please note that I don't endorse the straw man position that D'Souza argues against).\n\nSo what did cause the rise of the West? Well D'Souza has his answers:\n\n&gt;...the West became the dominant civilization in the modern era [because] it invented three institutions: science democracy and capitalism. These institutions did not exist anywhere else in the world, nor did they exist in the West until the modern era.\n\nSo, I'm going to ignore the fact that at least two of these institutions did not contribute to rise of the West in the early modern era (as that would be rather anacrhonistic) and instead I'm going to point out I'm definitely not a historian of economics or science so I don't feel comfortable commenting on his points about capitalism and science. However as to his assertions about democracy being a distinctly Western idea he seems to be forgetting (funnily enough seeing as how he is from India about [sanghas and ganas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy#India) also he makes the bizzarre claim that democracy didn't exist in the Western world until the modern era. This is made even more odd by the fact that he references Athens in the very next sentence (also the Roman Republic was apparently not a thing).\n\nOn the second to last page D'Souza finally distinguishes between imperialism and colonialism (or at least tangentially acknowledges that there different)  and concludes the chapter by denying that Westerners economically exploited the lands they controlled.\n\nThis chapter is a jumbled mess of hypocrisies and misinformation and I don't intend to slog through it again in the foreseeable future. If I myself have oversimplified, misrepresented arguments or am guilty of historical inaccuracies please feel free to correct me as this is my first write up. ",

I'll leave the problem with that statement up to you, as you're smart people.\n\nThe first thing she says is that Muslims ruled over France, Austria, and \"all\" of southeastern Europe. There was never a caliphate nor a claim to rule in France by an Islamic state, nor did Muslims ever rule over Austria, and they only came close during the Siege of Vienna in 1529 (in which the Turks lost) and again in 1683 (which they lost again). The Siege of 1529 actually marked the height of Ottoman power in central and southeastern Europe, so any claims they got farther are ridiculous. And don't ask me where she got the idea that France was ever occupied by Islamic rulers (the closest they ever got was Aquitaine).\n\nThe second incorrect statement she comes up with is that Muslims were pushed out of the ruling class by the Inquisition. However, the Caliphate of Cordoba (the only Muslim caliphate I can think of that ever actually occupied modern European lands outside of the eastern end of the continent) disintegrated several hundred years before the Inquisition even started, although it is true that the Inquisition pushed out many Moors who still remained in Spain. \n\nLast but certainly not least is the statement that \"the mayo\" simply used Muslim infrastructure for the purpose of \"colonialism.\" While it is true that the Spanish and lands in southeastern Europe previously occupied by Turks did use the infrastructure left behind by the previous rulers (who wouldn't?), to assume that Europeans are \"colonialist\" for ruling over their native lands is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nSo there you go - racist, crazy, and terrible at history! My own history is a bit shaky (and if I made any errors in my post, go ahead and tell me), but it's not hard to be better at it than this troglodyte.\n\nSources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Europe, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate_of_C%C3%B3rdoba, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Vienna, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna\n\nEDIT: [The top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2exfuh/i_have_no_words_for_this_just_look/ck3uipu) over in /r/TumblrInAction sums it up quite well.\n\nEDIT 2: \"now Muslims are now\" in the title.

However-\n\n&gt;The American response was not to try to improve our soccer skills, but was to instead withdraw from the international community and form the MLS in hopes of at least being able to isolate ourselves and win something.\n\nThis sentence has a lot of things wrong with it.\n\nFirst off, MLS was not primarily formed due to an \"American response\". When the US won the bid for the 1994 World Cup host, a part of the US bid was to form a Division 1 soccer league. The NASL (not to be confused with the present-day NASL, second division of the US/Canada soccer pyramid) had folded in 1984, leaving the US without a top-tier soccer league prior to 1994. So, the formation of MLS was not because of naive American exceptionalists, but rather by FIFA- as far from Americans as you can get.\n\nAnd the formation of MLS means that we withdraw from international soccer? What? That is quite the opposite of what MLS did. It does not even make sense. To compete in the [confederation](http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/confederations/)'s premier club championship, the CONCACAF Champions League (Champions Cup before 2008) one needs a good team. And MLS provides that good team. \n\nThe first time an American club reached the final ([see final matches here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Champions_League#Finals_.28Champions_Cup_era.29)) was in 1997, where the LA Galaxy lost to Liga MX's Cruz Azul 5-3. The following year, DC United won the 1998 CONCACAF Champions Cup. Guess how DC United and LA Galaxy came into existence? That's right- Major League Soccer. How does MLS isolate American soccer from international competition when MLS clubs enter, and are successful, in international competition?\n\nThe successes of MLS also transfer to the successes of the US men's national soccer team (USMNT). [Look at the USMNT's World Cup record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup#Record_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup). \n\n1990 was the first time the US went to the World Cup for over 40 years. The US has qualified for all World Cups since then, since the foundation of MLS. Now you tell me that the rise of interest in soccer, a decent professional league, and good performance in the World Cup means that, in the words of our commenter,\n\n&gt;the MLS has failed.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's address this statement by the poster.\n\n&gt;Ultimately, this perpetuates the cycle by continuing the stigma Americans feel towards soccer and soccer players\n\nStigma? Tell that to the millions of Americans playing soccer. In [this](http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/bcoffsurv/emaga_9384_10704.pdf) 2007 FIFA report, it shows how the US Soccer Federation were in the top two for many metrics, including number of players in total and number of youth players. Sure, the fact that the US is very populous contributes to that. However, these numbers still show that US soccer is somewhat popular, or at least on the rise even back in 2007. \n\nAnd\n\n&gt;This isolation leads our strongest and brightest players to leave American soccer and head over to play in different international leagues\n\nThe reason many players leave the US is not because of MLS's faults. Quite the opposite- MLS made them of international quality. That's a good thing. Remember, USA world cup performance. Some of the best US players play in MLS (Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey, etc.) or play in top-tier leagues after their performance and development in MLS. [Tim Howard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Howard), Everton goalkeeper, got his start in the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, now the New York Red Bulls. This is good for ~~bitcoin~~ American soccer.\n\n---\n\nNow let's move on to comparing baseball and soccer. The poster also states that MLB is the league that should be an example for e-sports because\n\n&gt;Teams began to look abroad for players.\n\nMLS does that too. That's a major part of why the league implemented the [Designated Player Rule](http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations) in 2007- to attract star foreign players (David Beckham, Thierry Henry) and star USMNT players that played abroad (Clint Dempsey, Eddie Johnson). But how does MLS's influx of foreign players compare to other leagues, specifically MLB? The post we're discussing says,\n\n&gt;Only 59.5% of professional baseball players were born in the United States [39.5% born internationally]. 28.7% come from Latin America, 2.5% from Asia, and 9.3% come from different assorted nations. The MLB draws on a massive pool of international players in order to be the epitome of baseball competition.\n\nAlright, there's that. I assume he's talking about the 2012 MLB season. But I can't find any stats that support that.\n\nIn 2013, MLS boasted the most diverse (in terms of nationality) players of the Big 4 + MLS leagues. ([source](http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/03/28/major-league-soccer-releases-annual-players-world-map)) MLS states that 40.1% of its players in 2013 are foreign-born, higher than even the 39.5% percentage that the post says. Again, can't find anything that says \"only 59.5% of professional basketball players were born in the United States\".\n\nBut 2013 might be too recent for this sub, so let's go back to something like [2006](http://www.tidesport.org/RGRC/2006/2006_RGRC_MLB.pdf). On page 4, they state\n\n&gt;The percentage of international players in MLB was 31 percent, up one percentage \npoint.\n\nNo evidence to support the claim of almost 40% foreign-born. 59.5% of MLB players in 2006 were *white*, though. \n\n---\n\nThe poster further states,\n\n&gt;For those of you who do not know much of the history of Major League Baseball, it has not always been the historically most competitive baseball league. In fact, early on, it faced serious challenges from foreign leagues, especially in Mexico. American born players would often leave American baseball leagues in order to make more money and earn more fame.\n\nNo sources or links for his claims. I tried searching for this, but I can't find anything about baseball players choosing to leave and play internationally. There's the [Mexican Baseball League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_League), which was founded in 1925. MLB went into trouble a few years after the Mexican league was founded, but that was mainly due to the Great Depression as opposed to any American baseball players leaving the US. \n\nBut the problem during the Great Depression was not a lack of players, but rather a lack of money. The baseball teams, however, were able to innovate and get through the 30s relatively unscathed, as evidenced by this passage from [a New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/sports/baseball/07depression.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;): \n\n&gt;Remarkably, while thousands of banks collapsed during the Depression and millions of people lost their jobs, no major league baseball franchises folded or moved during the period (though at least two changed hands, including the Boston Red Sox).\n\nBaseball players *did* leave en masse, but not due to a desire for better teams abroad. Rather, MLB was faced with a huge manpower shortage during WWII as many of its players were drafted into service ([When Baseball Went to War](http://books.google.com/books?id=pYovAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=baseball+world+war+II&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), page 8), to the point where Pete Gray, a one-armed outfielder, was able to play with the St. Louis Browns.\n\nAll of this shows that the author of the /r/leagueoflegends post had some misconceptions about Major League Soccer and other American sports. I hope this is educational and does not break the subreddit rules. Thank you for reading.",

Those were the Crusades. But it's easier to hate them if they're just mindless killing savages instead of the embattled people we used to slaughter who are looking for venegance and justice.\n\n&gt; By no means does it condone their actions, but makes them less senseless.\n\nKill me.\n\n* Casualties were nowhere near \"hundreds of thousands.\" The most exaggerated figures for e.g. the sack of Jerusalem are in the tens of thousands, more likely they should be in the single thousands.\n\n* The Crusades were not some kind of scorched-earth campaign to destroy Islam. They didn't have a single objective but collective *defense* was an important part of the motivation.\n\n* The Crusades are about as relevant to the modern Islamic world as the Viking raids are to modern Europe &amp;ndash; except that nobody has a modern-day reason to rhetorically invoke the Vikings in a dispute with modern Norway.\n\n* Islamic terrorism's anti-Western views are not rooted in the Crusades. It's something they bring up because they're [obsessed with an idealized version of the past,](http://books.google.ca/books?id=uDPmD8iGy_YC&amp;pg=PA183) but the Crusades were never an especially big deal in Muslim historiography until much more recent interactions with the West caused them to take a second look.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, bringing whiteness into this is equally absurd. The concept of Whiteness didn't exist at the time of the Crusades. Both sides in the Crusades contained people who might or might not have been anachronistically classified as \"white.\" Arabs were not necessarily darker than Greeks or Venetians.",

Need to get back to bed.\n\n&gt;Thomas Jefferson Spent 15 million dollars to triple the size of the U.S.\n\nNo, this is wrong on two counts:\n\n1. It did not triple the size of the United States. It about [doubled it,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase#mediaviewer/File:LouisianaPurchase.png) give or take.\n\n2. The U.S. committed to paying France a bit over $11 million, while also agreeing to cancel about $3.75 million in debts. Slight detail, but it's the total of these two that makes the *cost* about $15 million.\n\n&gt;Lincoln killed 500,000 people to keep it together,\n\nWell, this is a particularly silly mistake, as the person's point here seems to be to criticize Lincoln. In which case they could go with the more commonly accepted figures, which range from 600-750 thousand~~, or well in excess one million if you're a neo-Confederate~~. So it's another example of internet Civil War revisionists not knowing enough about the Civil War to even make a better—but still ultimately bad—case for their beliefs. Anyway, blaming Lincoln for these casualties is rather foolish as well, as it requires one think that the war was basically his idea entirely, ignoring the nationalism that inspired folks to take up arms against the rebels, as well as the persistence of the Confederates themselves. Plus there's the whole part about him being an official elected and bound to uphold the integrity of the Constitution of his country.\n\n&gt;while spending 15 million dollars to buy all the slaves\n\nNo, this figure isn't even close. The total value of slavery in the United States amounted to about $4 billion, not counting any losses in agricultural production that would come from compensated emancipation not flawlessly executed. Then there's the part about Lincoln trying to pass compensated emancipation through the Delaware state congress, which was rejected. It's important to note that Delaware had the lowest slave population both in total number and percentage of population of any state that officially allowed slavery. Expecting that such a thing be even *proposed* in places like South Carolina or the rest of the Deep South *not* lead to secession by itself is a weird view, as it took less than this hostility to slavery to get them to secede in the first place. In much of the Deep South, life without slavery just simply wasn't imaginable—both due to the economic implications (esp. in the cotton and rice belts) and the social implications. As a demonstration of the latter, you don't have to dig through much material to gauge Southerners' sense of horror in response to isolated events like Nat Turner's rebellion or John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry.\n\nSo, ultimately, the number's ridiculously low in comparison to the total value of property held in slavery in the South, and the idea of compensated emancipation on the federal level occurring in 1861 would by itself be laughable if such issues didn't require at least a smattering of sensitivity.\n\n&gt;and then banning the import of slaves probably would've kept the union together anyway.\n\nThe ban on the import of slaves had been banned in [1807.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves) Of course, it still happened, but that's a different issue. The point is that trading had long been prohibited, violations did lead to prosecution, and the Royal Navy did actively enforce its laws prohibiting the African slave trade in the Atlantic. So this point is just irrelevant to the argument.",

        "text": "I found [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2f3a6r/til_santa_is_red_and_white_because_coca_cola/) in TIL, and while the comments are quick to point out that that is both inaccurate and not actually what the Coca Cola website says, the [Coca Cola website](http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/faq/rumours/is-it-true-santa-is-red-because-of-coca-cola.html) isn't entirely accurate either. \n\nSo how do we get our modern image of Santa Claus? Santa Claus, as we all know, is roughly based on [Saint Nicholas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas), a lovely 4th century figure known for giving gifts and being the patron saint of things. Much of the modern American image of Santa Claus, though, is based not on St. Nicholas, but rather on a combination of cultural images of a Christmas figure, including the British [Father Christmas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/FatherChristmastrial.jpg) and the Dutch [Sinterklaas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Intocht_van_Sinterklaas_in_Schiedam_2009_%284102602499%29_%282%29.jpg). \n\nThe connection between Sinterklaas and Santa Claus is debated. [This source](http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nicholas/nicholas_of_myra3.html) makes the case that one directly influenced the other through both Thomas Nast (who I'll get to) and Dutch colonists in New Amsterdam. However, there isn't much in the way of hard evidence that the Dutch living in New Amsterdam ever really celebrated Sinterklaas, though the fact that it was a Dutch holiday at this point suggests they did. Washington Irving certainly thought it had been celebrated in New Amsterdam, including it in novels and stories about the region. *Knickerbocker's History of New York from The Beginning of the World To the End of The Dutch Dynasty* published in 1809 featured Sinterklaas as a character, and his 1812 edition of *A History of New York* included an image of Sinterklaas flying over rooftops in a flying wagon, something which almost certainly influenced the development of the image of Santa Claus.\n\nThe first recorded image of Santa riding in a sleigh pulled by reindeer comes from 1821 in *A New-year's present, to the little ones from five to twelve* which contained a poem about \"Old Santeclaus.\" This also contained a depiction of Santa in a red outfit quite unlike that of Sinterklaas or of previous depictions of the character. In 1823, the poem [A Visit from St. Nicholas](http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/visit-st-nicholas) by Clement Clark Moore further popularised the image. The first American image of a character unquestionably labelled as \"Santa Claus\" was based on the Moore poem and appeared in 1837. This character was short, beardless, and rather evil-looking, though he did dress in red and stuff a bag of toys down chimneys. It was a combination of many cultural influences, with some German and Dutch imagery, but also with some imagery shared with Father Christmas. \n\nEnter Thomas Nast, cartoonist and illustrator for the magazine *Harper's Weekly.* Nast is a fascinating figure in and of himself, popularising many common American political images such as the elephant and the donkey to represent the Republican and Democrat parties, but in this context, we're going to talk about Santa Claus. Nast is a key figure in his creation, not only creating 76 images of Santa, but also potentially establishing many aspects of the lore, including that Santa Claus lived at the North Pole. His first [images](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Santa_Claus_1863_Harpers.png) of Santa Claus involve the character in the Civil War on the Union side (Nast was a political cartoonist, after all), but evolved to show him in [more familiar settings](http://webcomicoverlook.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/nast1271.jpg?w=604). [This](http://webcomicoverlook.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/santa_claus_2.jpg?w=604) image from 1881 is probably the single most famous of his Santa Claus images, and is one of the greatest influences on the modern depiction of the character. Even at this point, though, the character could be found in [a bright red suit](http://webcomicoverlook.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/nast-works.jpg?w=604). \n\nThis is not to say that Coca Cola didn't have a role in popularising the character. Santa had been used in advertising throughout the early 20th century, including advertising [mineral water in 1915](http://www.whiterocking.org/images/sf1915web.jpg)  ([this gallery](http://www.whiterocking.org/santa.html) is full of fun images from the 1910s to mid-1920s, with [this one](http://www.whiterocking.org/images/life121223web.jpg) being my favourite). Coca Cola began advertising using illustrator Haddon Sundblom's [version of the character](http://www.stnicholascenter.org/media/images/t/time-1931a.jpg) in 1931. The rest, they say, is history as the character became ingratiated with Christmas, the spirit of giving, and American culture. The image evolved to fit with the times - Santa's workshop became industrialised by the end of the 20th century, for instance - but the original image influenced by Dutch settlers and encapsulated by Nast remained roughly the same. \n\nSource and further reading: Christmas in America by Penne L.

Although the one who responded could have meant the Byzantine Empire when they mean Rome, as the Byzantines saw themselves as Romans and not Byzantines, and I suppose it could also refer to the Greeks because Byzantium is known to have had holdings in Greece, and so this would apply as the Ottomans fought the Byzantines. However, the first poster said 'Ancient' Rome and Greece, clearly meaning the Greek City States and The Roman Republic/Empire, and not the Byzantines.\n\nIn any case, the person is still incorrect because he or she claims that the parts of Europe were 'colonized' by Rome and Greece were 'liberated' by the forces of Islam. And while the people might have been discontent with the ruling powers due to the [Empire's rapid decline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Byzantine_Empire), no evidence supports that they wanted the Ottomans to 'liberate' them. Also, the Ottomans and the Byzantines were fighting wars against each other, and the populations of the Byzantine territory shared neither ethnicity, as Byzantines were [Greek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Greeks) and the Ottoman Empire was founded by [Oghuz Turks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire)(In the first sentence, \"was an empire founded under [Oghuz Turks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Turks) under Osman Bey), nor religion, as the Byzantines had [Eastern Orthodoxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire) as a state church, while the Ottomans followed [Islam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) as their state religion (in the links it says so in the sidebars.) Although the Ottomans did [defeat the byzantines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Ottoman_Wars)(in the side bar, the results are stated as 'Ottoman Victory, Fall of the Byzantine Empire), the Byzantines may have disliked their rulers, but have shown no great affection towards the Ottomans, those of both differing race and religion, meaning the Byzantines had plenty of reason to see the Ottomans as heathens no better -or perhaps worse- than their own kings. Also, the Ottomans wanted to capture Constantinople not for the express purpose of liberating its people, but rather so that they [controlled trade and access between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean](http://www.chacha.com/question/why-did-the-ottoman-empire-want-to-conquer-constantinople)([This also](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090920155802AAZiTr4)), and since Byzantium was seen as a surviving portion of the Roman Empire, Constantinople was seen as a great prize for any to conquer, as conquering it would literally be conquering the last of Rome itself, giving Mehmed II the chance to declare the Turks the [Third Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople#Third_Rome) and [himself *Kayser-i-Rum*, or Caesar of Rome.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Rome#Ottoman_claims) So it suffices to say that the Ottomans were not liberators, but rather conquerors as they are neither returning any racial majority or minority to power, nor rescuing any religious minority or majority from persecution. Rather, as a foreign power of both different ethnicity and religion coming in and taking control, the Ottomans of Islam did the opposite of Liberate the Byzantines, the spiritual successors of Greece and Rome, or the Ancient World in general.",

Now, some of it can be awesome and unexpected, which is really cool for history! But there's more to it than those things. It's kind of similar to the bad history of scientists. They had really cool things that contributed to modern science, but we only remember those things. Some of them had batshit insane ideas as well. Same with ancient people, they may have unexpectedly interesting technology, but that doesn't make them this super futuristic society.\n\n2. It appears to come from a linear view of technology and progress. Though I can't decide if he's looking at it *from* a linear view (Given he uses the phrase \"more advanced\") or if he's arguing *against* the idea of a linear view. But regardless, he *usually* uses this as an argument against evolution... (No, seriously, he likes to talk about how ancient people had awesome stuff, therefor humans aren't advancing and evolving... but this isn't badscience, so moving on)\n\n3. The words \"advanced\" and \"intelligent\" are highly problematic in use here. It's got an air of presentism to it. What is being defined as \"advanced\" and \"intelligent?\" Where is the marker? Intelligence itself already is a very subjective, culturally defined word. And again, this gets dangerously close to a linear view of advancement and intelligence, which is just plain silly.\n\nAnd this all before I just have to wonder... what modern academia doesn't want to admit technology of ancient people? As far as I know, academia finds it awesome! But, apparently ancient aliens counts now or something",

OP doesn't give a date for this statement but the Empire fought a series of wars against states that wanted to be independent and opposed Indian independence, often violently, for decades. [The Suez crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis#Nationalisation_of_the_Suez_Canal_and_the_road_to_crisis) came about because the British government refused to permit Egypt - which was no longer part of the Empire as such - to nationalise the Suez Canal. That's right, Great Britain cared so little about whether states became independent that they backed military action against client states who tried to act independently!\n\nPresumably what OP was getting at was Harold MacMillan's ['Wind of Change' speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_of_Change_(speech)), which made it clear that Britain would allow independence to African colonies (in particular). This was not so much a product of the government's 'not caring' as it was a recognition of the impossibility of maintaining the Empire in anything like its form at the time (the 1960s) and a wish to avoid an [Algeria-type situation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War) where a war of independence became a bloodbath that only delayed, not prevented, decolonisation.\n\nSo far, things aren't too bad: It's an almost understandable gloss by someone who maybe isn't too familiar with pre-WW2 British history.\n\nThen this happens:\n\n&gt;Britain didn't so much as to fight wars of expansionist conquest, they protected trade routes\n\nFrom the [Conquest of Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_conquest_of_Ireland) to the [Second Boer War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War), Britain fought wars to expand its territory. We could even controversially include the First World War in this category, given that one of the consequences of the war was [to increase the Empire's holdings to their greatest ever extent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_World_War_I#Aftermath). To gloss British Imperial history as an attempt to 'protect trade routes' is insane. It's not as though Britain fought [three wars with the Dutch in the 17th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars) because they were worried the Dutch were blocking trade routes between Europe and Asia: They fought those wars because the Dutch were *using* the trade routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n&gt;A lot of the expansion was from colonisation of otherwise unclaimed land or unused.\n\nI don't think the users of /r/badhistory need telling that the *[terra nullius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nullius)* idea is nonsense. I'm sure the Caribs would be interested to hear that the Caribbean was 'unclaimed [...] or unused'... Except there aren't any left, so who cares what they think, right? Likewise, the Native Americans, many Africans, Indians and Australians Aborigines would probably line up to point out that they were actually using the land when the British got to it. Even the Dutch, French, Spanish and Portuguese might chime in at this point and suggest that not only were there one or two natives when they showed up, there were actually quite a lot of Dutch, French, Spanish or Portuguese people by the time the British arrived to 'protect trade routes [by shooting people]'.\n\n&gt;when they colonised countries they also integrated the natives\n\nFeel free to have a go if you think you can work out what OP means by this. That they 'integrated' others by forcing them to speak English and worship Christ? Wasn't that nice of them?\n\n&gt;Britain wasn't as warmongering as you think, ever heard of the East India Trading Company? A lot of Britains colonisation was through trade routes and treaty's\n\nTreaties that other people signed after losing wars. Wars of expansion. Just saying 'Hey, it's a treaty!' isn't particularly helpful and in no way invalidates the claim that Britain went to war to expand the Empire. There's also the thing about trade routes again, this time with the claim that they colonised 'through' trade routes, whatever that means.\n\nThe East India Company was, of course, incorporated and regulated by the British, so to claim it wasn't really anything to do with the Empire is inaccurate. The East India Company had the explicit support and patronage of the Empire for its entire existence. The British Treasury [accepted donations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company#Forming_a_complete_monopoly) from the Company in return for allowing them a monopoly of Indian trade. Indeed, it was found that the Crown legally had sovereignty of all territory acquired by the Company (or other British companies), though the property of such holdings was not vested in the crown. Later, [Parliament passed various acts which established its control over the EIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company#Regulating_Acts_of_Parliament), [fully nationalising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India_Act_1858) it in 1858 after [the Indian Rebellion of the previous year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857), which incidentally is a pretty good example of the British caring *quite a bit* whether their colonies gained independence.\n\nLong story short, you don't wind up ruling a quarter of the world's land mass without killing people. The idea that the British were just protecting trade (they established monopolies), that they only occupied unused land (they didn't) or that they expanded just by people signing treaties (did countries just sign away their right to their own soil and resources for no reason?) is nonsense. To try and slap all the blame on the East India Company is disingenuous: They were a British company acting with British permission and the only significant conflicts between Empire and Company were over who had the rights to the profits, not whether they should maybe stop doing all that conquest.\n\nHistory isn't simple:^[citation ^needed] The British Empire wasn't 100% good or 100% evil. A classic example is that they abolished slavery... [but only having done much of the work in establishing the Transatlantic Slave Trade in the first place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade). OP's idea that the Empire was good but the East India Company was evil is stupid, self-contradictory and inaccurate.",

        "text": "Next week, PBS is airing a [documentary](http://www.pbs.org/pov/aftertiller/) about third trimestre abortions. You can imagine it's a bit controversial. Personally, I love controversy, and so I bopped on over to the site to see what it was about and what people were saying about it. There, I found comment chains such as [this one](http://i.imgur.com/OS2I7KI.png) which say, roughly, that Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, was doing nasty racist things. What sort of racist things? Well, this isn't the first time I've run into a claim like this. [Rev. Hunter here](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14650805) is repeating it, saying: \n\n&gt; I go right back to that Negro project. She came up with that project specifically just to woo ministers and to woo blacks into controlling the population of blacks. She really wanted to see the black population decrease. And you got to understand the eugenics. As far as Margaret Sanger's plan, Hitler's playing for the Jewish people was just fine. And people haven't gotten disturbed enough to realize, oh, my goodness. This Negro project that she started to decrease the black population is well underway to this day.\n\nYou find it echoed on a whole [site](http://www.blackgenocide.org/archived_articles/negro.html) about it. This site includes one of the key quotes that's cited when people make the claim that Margaret Sanger wanted to eliminate black people. That quote is:\n\n&gt; The minister’s work is also important and he should be trained, perhaps by the Federation as to our ideals and the goal that we hope to reach. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.\n\nHm. Seems pretty damning. The trouble is, though, that all of these are sources of bad history and are misrepresenting or misinterpreting Sanger, her work, and her beliefs. \n\nWho was Margaret Sanger, then? Was she a eugenicist hell bent on wiping out black people and those she deemed inferior? Not quite. Margaret Sanger was a nurse working in the slums of New York City in the 1910's. She was involved in socialist and workers' rights movements, including participating in strikes. She had a great deal of sympathy for the working women she helped in the slums (and even [dedicated one of her pamphlets specifically to them](http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/AmRad/whateverygirl1920.pdf)) and for their problems. One of the relatively common problems she encountered was the problems dealing with pregnancy and self-attempted abortions. Due to things like [Comstock Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comstock_laws), information about and access to birth control was limited, leading women to take extreme and dangerous steps to prevent giving birth. In response to these experiences, in 1912, she published the columns \"What Every Mother Should Know\" and \"What Every Girl Should Know,\" giving advice about sex, sexuality, and birth control. In 1914, she began publishing \"The Woman Rebel,\" a newspaper advocating heavily for contraception and for the idea that a woman ought to be the master of her own body. \n\nThe underlying motivation here was not one of eugenics, but of women's empowerment. In Sanger's own words, she was interested in ensuring that a woman was \"the absolute mistress of her own body.\" For her, birth control was a way to achieve this, allowing women to make their own decisions about when to get pregnant and how many children they wanted to have. Her motives were very much socialist and very much about workers' empowerment, but not about murdering all the babies.\n\nHowever, this is not to say Sanger isn't a controversial figure. She did work with eugenics groups and did support some eugenicist ideas, such as incentivising voluntary sterilisation of the infirm and those with genetic conditions, and  limiting immigration of the \"diseased and feebleminded\" into the US. However, agreeing with some of these principles does not mean she agreed with every aspect of eugenics. Far from it. In 1919, she clarified her feelings about eugenics and its goals in the [*Birth Control Review,*](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=143449.xml) saying things like:\n\n&gt; Eugenists emphasize the mating of healthy couples for the conscious purpose of producing healthy children, the sterilization of the unfit to prevent their populating the world with their kind and they may, perhaps, agree with us that contraception is a necessary measure among the masses of the workers, where wages do not keep pace with the growth of the family and its necessities in the way of food, clothing, housing, medical attention, education and the like. We who advocate Birth Control, on the other hand, lay all our emphasis upon stopping not only the reproduction of the unfit but upon stopping all reproduction when there is not economic means of providing proper care for those who are born in health. The eugenist also believes that a woman should bear as many healthy children as possible as a duty to the state. We hold that the world is already over-populated. Eugenists imply or insist that a woman's first duty is to the state; we contend that her duty to herself is her duty to the state.\n\nThere are some problematic statements in there, but it does get more problematic with statements like:\n\n&gt; While I personally believe in the sterilization of the feeble-minded, the insane and syphilitic, I have not been able to discover that these measures are more than superficial deterrents when applied to the constantly growing stream of the unfit. They are excellent means of meeting a certain phase of the situation, but I believe in regard to these, as in regard to other eugenic means, that they do not go to the bottom of the matter. Neither the mating of healthy couples nor the sterilization of certain recognized types of the unfit touches the great problem of unlimited reproduction of those whose housing, clothing, and food are all inadequate to physical and mental health. These measures do not touch those great masses, who through economic pressure populate the slums and there produce in their helplessness other helpless, diseased and incompetent masses, who overwhelm all that eugenics can do among those whose economic condition is better.\n\nMargaret Sanger held some eugenicist views; her own writings make that clear. What is important to keep in mind, though, is that her advocacy of birth control is not an advocacy of sterilisation as such. What it is instead is an argument that, with fewer children, more attention can be paid to those children, making them better children. She even says as much here:\n\n&gt; Birth Control, on the other hand, not only opens the way to the eugenist, but it preserves his work. Furthermore, it not only prepares the ground in a natural fashion for the development of a higher standard of motherhood and of family life, but enables the child to be better born, better cared for in infancy and better educated.\n\nEven if Sanger did believe in eugenics and the idea of better people, the ideas behind birth control were those of women's empowerment and general improvement of quality of life. Equally, the fact that Sanger *did* hold these views isn't a statement about birth control and its effectiveness, as Planned Parenthood states in [this fun pamphlet](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/8013/9611/6937/Opposition_Claims_About_Margaret_Sanger.pdf). Finally, it has to be kept in mind that these views were not uncommon in that era. While we may look back on them now and find them morally reprehensible, they have to be considered in their own time as well, where they were considered scientifically and morally justified.\n\nHowever, if Sanger believed in some aspects of eugenics, does that mean she was interested in committing a genocide against blacks and preventing them from reproducing? Not really. The Negro Project began in the 1930s, first with the opening of a clinic in Harlem, and then moving to opening clinics in the South. Her goal in this project was to help:\n\n&gt; a group notoriously underprivileged and handicapped to a large measure by a ‘caste' system that operates as an added weight upon their efforts to get a fair share of the better things in life. To give them the means of helping themselves is perhaps the richest gift of all. We believe birth control knowledge brought to this group, is the most direct, constructive aid that can be given them to improve their immediate situation.\n\nIt's a bit paternalistic, but then, so is a lot of writing from the period. Once again, it has to be considered that she was a product of her time. Her very racist time. \n\nSome of the more difficult aspects of the Negro Project come in with some of the publications surrounding it. The pamphlet \"Birth Control and the Negro\" written in 1939, for instance, contained language meant to appeal to eugenicists and progressives alike. Lines describing blacks as \"still breed carelessly and disastrously\" would suggest a racist bent to the whole project. It's from the Negro Project as well that we get the line I quoted at the beginning about \"We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.\" These sorts of lines have been interpreted as meaning that Sanger set out to eliminate blacks through the use of birth control. However, in the greater context of her goals and her writings, it's clear that her concern was not eliminating blacks, but rather, her views of both women's empowerment and the betterment of society through more controlled reproduction. [This site](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/newsletter/articles/bc_or_race_control.html) does an excellent job summing up many of her arguments (better than I do, anyway), and I highly recommend it. Now, none of this means that there wasn't some co-opting of her ideas. Racist doctors undoubtedly used birth control to sterilise women they saw as unfit. However, Sanger did not believe in this and never advocated for forced sterilisation or a genocide of blacks. Her arguments were for voluntary use of birth control and voluntary sterilisation. Indeed, in a letter written in 1939 to Sidney Lassell, she rejected any definition of \"unfit\" as related to reproduction based on race or religion. \n\nThis brings me to the final bit of bad history from our dear friend Rev. Hunter. He claims that:\n\n&gt; As far as Margaret Sanger's plan, Hitler's playing for the Jewish people was just fine.\n\nI hope I've made it clear at this point that, flawed though some of Sanger's ideas were, she was not racist in her application of birth control. I'll let Sanger herself refute this bit of bad history in a letter from [1933](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/newsletter/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.html):\n\n&gt; All the news from Germany is sad &amp; horrible and to me more dangerous than any other war going on any where because it has so many good people who applaud the atrocities &amp; claim its right. The sudden antagonism in Germany against the Jews &amp; the vitriolic hatred of them is spreading underground here &amp; is far more dangerous than the aggressive policy of the Japanese in Manchuria.\n\nI think this means Margaret Sanger was not, in fact, Hitler.",

Suffice to say, I've written what's needed to be said to debunk their history. Which is bad. [Really, *really* bad](http://media.giphy.com/media/FZmL9gSnHBuKY/giphy.gif). Anyway, let's get into it.\n\nWe start with this charming piece of punditry.\n\n&gt; [Lebanon used to be a bright spot in a very dark Middle East. It was a rare democracy with a Christian majority... Radical Muslims from surrounding nations declared jihad on the Lebanese Christians, and poured into Southern Lebanon to set up a Muslim state. Radical Muslims who hated democracy and wanted to impose Sharia law turned the Lebanese oasis into a hell hole.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1J3UADW7NF58K/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0312358377&amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;nodeID=266239&amp;store=books)\n\n[Oookaaayyy...](http://www.gifwave.com/media/6913/movies-drinking-daniel-day-lewis-there-will-be-blood.gif)\n\nFirst off, while Lebanon once had a Christian majority, by the time of the Civil War, the demographics had changed. Nor was it a straight-forward democracy, and this is why the demographic change was a problem. Had it been a 'true' democracy, the Civil War may not have happened, which clearly casts it as a very different conflict from a Jihad 'against freedom'.\n\nLebanon as we understand it began as a French mandate carved out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of WWI as part of the Sykes-Picot agreement. The borders were drawn specifically in order to advantage the Maronite Christians whom the French had a long and friendly history with. Upon independence, the Lebanese political system was drawn up in the form of an unwritten agreement known as the National Pact which ensured certain things - most importantly for the subject at hand, it established the Confessional system of government which reserved various posts for members of different sects:\n\n* The Presidency was to be reserved for Maronite Christians.\n\n* The Prime Ministership was to be reserved for Sunni Muslims.\n\n* The post of Speaker of the National Assembly was to be reserved for Shia Muslims.\n\n* The posts of Deputy Speaker of the Parliament and Deputy Prime Minister were to be reserved for Greek Orthodox Christians.\n\n* The post of Chief of the General Staff was to be reserved for Druze.\n\n* And finally, the Parliament's membership ratio was to be preserved at 6:5 Christian to Muslim, favouring Christians.\n\nAs you can imagine this was a very fragile system in the long run, and this is how demographic change became a problem - since Muslims appeared to have become the majority by the time of the Civil War, many of Lebanese desired system more proportional and 'fair'. The National Movement - a coalition of various Leftist and Muslim groups - was formed, led by a Druze Socialist named Kamal Jumblatt (who had studied at the Jesuit University in Beirut) and demanded a secular democracy -  in the words of Jumblatt, '*only a secular, progressive Lebanon freed from Confessional-ism could ever hope to survive.*' Those are not the words of a crazed Jihadist radical who wants to destroy democracy and apple pie. \n\nMeanwhile, the right-wing Maronite ruling class wished to hold onto the National Pact with their teeth if they had to, as it enshrined them a privileged position. Additionally, they feared that a 'secular Lebanon' meant, in practice, Muslim majority rule. Nonethless, there were no negligible number of Christians in the National Movement and against the Maronite-dominated political order. An example of this would be the [Lebanese Communist Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Communist_Party#The_LCP_during_the_Civil_War), whose membership was primarily Greek Orthodox and Armenian.\n\nThese tensions, catalysed by the vast, mainly Muslim presence of Palestinian refugees,some of whom were using Lebanon as a base from which to attack Israel in the South, spilled over into the Civil War.\n\nThe eventual point here is that it is bad history to *uncritically* call 1970s a democracy, and that it is very bad history to present the opposition to the political order as militant Muslims bent on imposing Sharia law. And it would be very hard to argue that they hated democracy. That is not to say that during the course of the Civil War some groups *weren't* Islamists - for example, the Islamic Unification (Tawhid) Movement - but that these were each only one faction in a clusterfuck of a war drawn broadly down sectarian lines, which did experience a great deal sectarian violence (on all sides), but one which was at it's heart a political one. Second, as I've dealt with times before, most *Islamist* groups are ultimately political - the wave of Koran-crazed fighter motivated by the word of Allah as the reviewers imagine simply do not exist. \n\n&gt; [Brigitte Gabriel, lived as a ten year old girl through the terror as of Muslims from across the world flooded into Lebanon to wage a bloody and ruthless jihad against Lebanese Christians in which over 60 000 Lebanese Christian men, women and children were butchered.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R3GSZ2P6UH2FXI/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0312358377)\n\nAtrocities were certainly committed against the Maronites. However, as the war is presented here, a homogeneous block Christians were an innocent party, subject to a homogeneous block of Jihadi Muslims. There is no mention of the fact that, as mentioned, the war was a complicated battle of politics nor of the fact that Maronite groups carried out just as many atrocities. Speaking of which...\n\n&gt; [In Lebanon every person carried an identity document that identified their religion and what sect of religion they belonged to. Cars were stopped at PLO or Muslim, and if the Palestinians or Muslims realized that the occupants the cars were sprayed with bullets and the entire families inside, killed, with shouts of \"Allahu Akbar\".](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R3GSZ2P6UH2FXI/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0312358377l)\n\nSuch things actually happened, this is true. The most famous of these incidents, and the first one, was part of Black Saturday, the day in which tensions began to escalate into Civil War. Around 300 to 400 civilians were murdered in this way on that day, but they weren't Christians. In fact, the killings were carried out by a Maronite Phalangist group against Muslim Lebanese and Palestinians (some of whom may have been Christian - Palestinians were identified by their *lack* of cards). \n\n&gt; [A horrific exercise in ethnic cleansing that was ignored by the world and by those who's self-proclaimed task was to stand up for human rights.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R3GSZ2P6UH2FXI/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0312358377l)\n\nThis is not true. Many states intervened, arguably primarily in order to secure their own interests, but nevertheless under at least a pretense of standing up for human rights. At the request of Maronite President Suleiman Frangieh, Syria invaded and, to further drive home the point that the war was not solely sectarian, supported his government. Syria provided the majority of the [Arab Deterrent Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Deterrent_Force), an international peacekeeping force assembled by the Arab League.\n\nAdditionally, in 1982, [a UN peacekeeping force was assembled also](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_Force_in_Lebanon). I suspect the idea that the international community ignored the violence in Lebanon has just been dreamed up by this reviewer so that they may believe that PC leftists are just enabling Islamic violence.\n\n\n&gt; [A favourite tactic of the Palestinians then, like Hezbollah now, is to set up rocket attacks from Christian villages. After the rockets are fired, the Islamists quickly pull out, knowing full well Israeli reprisals will then fall on innocent Christian habitations. And the media of course will be there to record the Jewish \"barbarism,\" while ignoring the initial terrorists attacks.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1J3UADW7NF58K/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0312358377&amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;nodeID=266239&amp;store=books)\n\n[There's maybe one or two teeny weeny problems with this.](http://www.fanaru.com/battlestar-galactica/image/18388-battlestar-galactica-what-the-frak.gif)\n\nA) Not all Palestinians are Islamists. The terms 'Palestinians' and 'Islamists' should not be used synonymously.\n\nB) At the time that the reviewer is referring to, during the 1970s, secular Palestinian movements held the most power. Specifically, the PLO - which was the organization raiding Israel from Lebanon at the time.\n\nC) Not all Palestinians are Muslims. Just to further invalidate the quote.\n\nD) Some Palestinians are Christians. The reviewer here seems to have got it into their head that there are just some passive Christians lying around for evil Muslims to put in the firing range. They haven't really thought about who the Christians might be. In any case, Palestinian Christians and Muslims worked together in the PLO to fight against Israel, as both religions are fully capable of nationalism.\n\nE) I've never really heard from any reputable source of any attacks of the kind described there. While PLO arguably did use Lebanon's sovereignty as a safe haven, putting Lebanese civilians in the line of fire when Israel invaded, the reviewer has filtered this so far through their own bigotry that it has been irreversibly distorted.\n\n&gt; [The Israelis were able to bring peace to the area and drive out the terrorists.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R3GSZ2P6UH2FXI/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0312358377)\n\nI may be treading a thin line here, but I find it hard to believe that any rational person - regardless of whether they think that Israel's invasion was justified in self defence or not - would really say that Israel brought *peace* to the area. Violence and civilian deaths only rose in South Lebanon following the invasion as any last vestiges or illusions of central authority collapsed. Lebanon was further destabilized. While the PLO were brought to their knees, as Israel had aimed to do, Hezbollah was also created, creating a long and drawn out guerilla war. Hardly peace.\n\n**Further Reading and Some Sources**:\n\n* *The Arabs: A History*, by Eugene Rogan\n\n* '[Iraq and Syria Follow Lebanon's Precedent](http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/iraq-and-syria-follow-lebanons-precedent#axzz3BV5cWimG)' in *Stratfor*, by George Friedman\n\n* *A Political Economy of the Middle East*, by Alan Richards and John Waterbury\n\n* *Who Speaks for Islam?*, by John Esposito and Dahlia Mogahed\n\n",

        "text": "So. I am a bit of a masochist, and I was looking through some reviews of the Twilight series. Yeah, yeah, I know, there are greater love stories than Twilight, the series sucks, whatever. I know.\n\nAnyways, reading a few reviews, when I came across this claim in one of Meyer’s writings:\n\n&gt; [Vegetarianism is a very popular thing right now, because we live in a society with a conscience, and we live in a society of plenty. You don't generally have the first without the last. Were there vegetarians 200 years ago? Maybe a few. 300 years ago? 500? The further you go back, the more likely it is that the answer is \"no.\"](http://www.twilightlexicon.com/2007/05/20/personal-correspondence-12/)\n\nSo. Guys. According to Meyer, vegetarianism is a modern concept that really took off within the last 200 years. And apparently 300 to 500 years ago, there were almost no vegetarians at all. This is ignoring all of the *other* shit implied in that statement, which I will NOT go into, because, you know, R2 and shit.\n\nWell then. Fuck. I guess it’s time to do a post on bad vegetarian history.\n\nLet’s start off with the Bible. I realize that the Bible alone is not a historical source, but bear with me here.\n\nThere are two mentions to eating vegetarian in the Bible. The first one occurs in the Book of Daniel:\n\n&gt; Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, “Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.” So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.\n\n&gt; At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.\n\n&gt; \\- [Daniel 1:11-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%201:11-16)\n\nSo basically, in the Book of Daniel, Daniel and his companions ate vegetarian for ten days as like a test, and the guards thought they looked great after said test, so they then made *all* of the servants eat vegetarian. Vegetarianism is part of David's mythos, something that makes him and his companions look healthy and strong compared to his fellow servants in the king's service.\n\n[By the way, this section of the Book of Daniel was believed to have been written from 167 to 164 BCE, and the book itself is quoted in a Sibylline Oracle from the middle of the 2nd century BCE.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Daniel#Dating)\n\nObviously this does not mean that a whole bunch of people were vegetarians at the time that David supposedly lived. It's simply just a mention of the practice. That's what the second passage is for.\n\nThe second occurs in the Epistle to the Romans, in the New Testament.\n\n&gt; Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.\n\n&gt; So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.\n\n&gt; \\- [Romans 14:20-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14%3A20-22&amp;version=NIV)\n\nIn the context of the passage ([Romans 1:1-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14:1-23)), the idea is that one should not judge someone else for having a differing way of showing their faith. Vegetarians should not be judged by their omnivore eating peers for choosing to be vegetarians, and likewise in converse. Furthermore, Paul writes that it is better for an omnivore to eat vegetarian in order to help solidify their fellow worshiper’s faith, to keep everyone faithful to the Lord.\n\n[This passage is believed by most Biblical scholars to be written by Paul between 55-57 CE.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Romans#Dating) In other words, *vegetarians were a thing at this time, and Paul was telling Christians in Rome to not judge their fellow worshipers on what they ate.*\n\nVegetarianism is also a thing in some Buddhist sects:\n\n&gt; [The *Nipata Sutta* underlines this point when it says that it is immorality that makes one impure (morally and spiritually), not the eating of meat. The Buddha is often described as eating meat, he recommended meat broth as a cure for certain types of illness and advised monks for practical reasons, to avoid certain types of meat, implying that other types were quite acceptable. However, Buddhists gradually came to feel uncomfortable about meat eating. In 257 BC King Asoka said that in contrast to before, only two peacocks and a deer were killed to provide food in the royal kitchens and that in time even this would be stopped. By the beginning of the Christian era meat eating had become unacceptable, particularly amongst the followers of the Mahayana although the polemics against it in works like the Lankavatara Sutra indicates that it was still widespread or a least a point of controversy. Tantric text dating from the 7th and 8th centuries onward, frequently recommend both drinking alcohol and eating meat and both are considered fit to offer to gods. This was probably as much an expression of the freedom from convention which Tantra taught as it was a protest against Mahayanists to whom practices like abstaining from drink and meat had become a substitute for genuine spiritual change.](http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm)\n\nIt’s also a thing [in certain traditions in Hinduism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_in_Hinduism#Vegetarian_Hindus) based off certain passages in scripture (such as a passage in the [*Mahabharata*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata#Historical_context) ~~from the *10th century BCE*)~~ and the idea of nonviolence against animals (or *ahimsa*). \n\n**EDIT:** As [some people](/r/badhistory/comments/2ephvg/-/ck21858?context=3) [here](/r/badhistory/comments/2ephvg/according_to_meyer_vegetarianism_apparently_was/ck2245n?context=3) have pointed out, I got the dating wrong. Oops. \n\n&gt; EEeeeeeee yes and no, the problem is there are serious problems with the textual tradition so putting a date on it is difficult. The MBH is one of the few areas where analytical positions actually make sense (as opposed to my home field of Homeric philology). Scholars try to focus on the tristubh metre, believing those sections to be oldest. You're still getting 3/4th century BC.\n\n&gt; Off the top of my head the best treatments are going to be found in the work of John Brockington - either his monumental \"Sanskrit Epic\" or \"Epic threads\" (but I think that one is more to do with the Ramayana). The Oberlies Grammar on Epic Sanskrit may have something too. When I'm at my place I can look through my notes and maybe find something more accessible a la JSTOR. \n\n&gt; Sorry I can't recommend something more finite off the top of my head, this isn't my home field and it's been like two years since I've even read any of the two monumental Sanskrit epics.\n\n&gt; As for the events depicted in the poem, scholars believe those to have happened around the 8/9th century. \n\nMy bad. This is why I should not be writing threads like this at 1 am.\n\nAnd it’s been a thing in Jainism from [at least the 6th or 5th century BCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_vegetarianism#Historical_background) under the exact same concept of *ahimsa*. In fact, followers of Jainism have historically accused Buddhists and Hindus for not following *ahimsa* as strictly as they were!\n\nAlso, see [this /r/AskHistorians thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dqbu1/when_where_and_why_did_vegetarianism_begin_as_a/).\n\nBasically? Despite what Meyer claims in regards to the history of vegetarianism, the practice was totally a thing 500 years ago, and not just among a \"few\" people. In fact, it's been a practice since at least the 6th/5th century BCE (thanks to Jainism), if not earlier ~~due to that passage from the *Mahabharata*, which is the basis of Hinduism~~.\n\nGod damn it.\n\n(Thanks /u/mosin91 for pointing me to the Biblical passages.)",

I'm not a historian of religion, so my aim with this post is not to correct false beliefs and have there be a final word on the subject.

Which ignores all of the history mentioned in the post itself: that there were dozens of Muslim dynasties, with very different ideas about the religion and conversion. It ignores that Islam spread to Asia by trade and commerce, with Indonesia now having the largest Muslim population in the world.\n\nThe failure of critical thinking here is that the poster is willing to accept that history is complex and cannot be reduced to simple statements, but then does this with Islam. What about Islam makes it OK to simplify it and reduce its history to a snappy statement?\n\n----\n\n**Muhammad was a pedophile!**\n\n&gt; [Muhammad was a warlord who married a 9 year old girl, this is the man who founded Islam.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2em7iv/in_which_muslims_are_not_brutish_barbarians/ck0yw0q)\n\nPeople love to throw around the image of Muhammad as someone so sex-crazed that he married as many women as he could, and even made it with a little girl. What a perv!\n\nLook, for the last time, pedophilia is not the same thing as child marriages in the 7th century. Muhammad's marriage fulfilled a very different role than what we think of as marriage today. This was an economic and political role, and this sort of marriage, with this sort of child bride, was by no means limited to Muhammad or the 7th century, or even that part of the world. For example, more than 700 years later, King Richard II of England married Isabella of Valois when she was 6 years old (as mentioned in a recent /r/AskHistorians post). This is obviously a major topic, and I'm sure someone else can comment at length about the context of this, and what “consummation” might have meant in that period.\n\nA failure of critical thinking in calling Muhammad a pedophile is that it involves presentism in its projection of modern beliefs onto a historical figure. Not to mention the complete lack of context, both in terms of child marriage in that period, and the role of marriage itself within that culture. Help me out, /r/badhistory, what else are they failing to see?\n\n----\n\n**These quotes from the Quran show that Islam is all about violence and killing!**\n\n&gt; [One of your sources uses this quranic quote to buttress the claim that islam is abolitionist. But it really shows the usual moral distinction Islam makes between muslims and scum-of-the-earth \"unbelievers\". Islam's so-called abolitionism is nothing more than another way of gaining converts through coercion.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2em7iv/in_which_muslims_are_not_brutish_barbarians/ck12p87)\n\nThis is /r/bad_religion territory here, but let's just look critically at this statement (and the Quran quote referenced is in the full comment). This comment takes a quote out of context and projects onto it an idea that Islam only compels good treatment for Muslims. As with every single out-of-context quote from the Quran, this completely ignores the context within the text itself, to say nothing of the historical context behind the passage quoted.\n\nWe see the quote \n\n&gt; [\"And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief] is worse than killing... but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)\"](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2dk0if/an_islamophobe_looks_at_mongol_history/cjqgt8p)\n\nOh my God, that's terrible! This statement could in no way be in reference to war with other tribes in 7th century Arabia! This translation could in no way include misleading notes about translated terms like fitna. Fitna, which could mean anything from disbelief, to civil war, to oppression. And it's funny how this translation helpfully explains that Zalimun are “the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.” Because, of course, that last sentence is specifically telling you to stop fighting except against aggressors. Or perhaps that is just my apologist translation?\n\n&gt; [I know there are many people that like to say Islam is \"really\" a religion of peace, but anyone that reads the Quran, which is arguably less open to interpretation than the Bible, and comes back and says it is any way an egalitarian text, or that it is peaceful, are blind apologists. ](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2em7iv/in_which_muslims_are_not_brutish_barbarians/ck0yw0q)\n\nAs with all historical sources, we can't just look at the text and say “it's proof that they're bad people!” Because there is a huge amount of historical context, especially with such a major document as the Quran. Ignoring this in favor of pullquotes that sound evil is as bad as the worst of bad history. It means completely ignoring how we are supposed to look at our sources critically. Why, it's almost as if there's an axe to grind.\n\n----\n\n**You're just nitpicking history if you don't have a problem with Islam!**\n\n&gt; [Seems like you're nitpicking\nThis video is obviously sensationalist as hell but it brings up a lot of good points. You sound like a typical Muslim apologist.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1ocyxr/review_why_we_are_afraid_a_1400_year_secret_by_dr/cd9ue5e)\n\nLook, there is so much to address that I can't possibly cover it all in any kind of depth and expect to get any work done today. The point of this post is that people are cherry-picking (nit-picking, if you will) history to get information that fits a narrative they already have about the evils of Islam. Whether this means taking Quran quotes out of context, or ignoring the history of the expansion of the Caliphate, a great crime is committed against good history every time a comment like one of these is posted.\n\nBy no means am I opposed to open debate. It would be horrible to never examine history critically. But that isn't what's happening here. When you write a comment with such an axe to grind, you're not debating anything. When you unironically use a phrase like “Islam apologists,” you are not thinking very critically.\n\nThis sub is supposed to be a showcase for bad history – let's not add to everything else that's out there.",

        "text": "/r/TodayILearned is always a fascinating pool of tidbits. For instance, did you know that [slavery in Islamic societies didn't end until the mid-20th century, and then only due to European colonial pressure?](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2eiv5y/til_islam_allows_slavery_and_muslim_societies/cjzxm8b) The thing about this particular tidbit, though, is that it's a tad pernicious. There's *a ton* of bad history surrounding slavery in the Islamic world, and this bit that it was European pressure that eventually ended it is one of the most commonly cited bits. Heck, if you read European accounts of ending slavery in the Middle East and other majority-Muslim parts of the British Empire, you'd get the distinct impression that abolition was a uniquely European institution. Wikipedia even [spouts it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_under_Muslim_rule#20th-century_suppression_and_prohibition) (in what could be one of the most jaw-droppingly terrible paragraphs I've read there). The thing is, though, that this is not the case. It's a very European way of looking at the abolition of slavery, but it isn't the case that slavery only ended because of external European pressure. The actual history is much more complex than that. I'm also not touching the idea that slavery in the Arab world didn't end until the mid-20th century - that's just blatantly wrong.\n\nArguably one of the earliest examples of an Islamic abolitionist movement can be found in the Druze. To be clear, I say it's arguable not because the Druze didn't advocate for abolition (or, indeed, social equality), but because the Druze aren't always seen as Muslim. Though the Druze faith sprang out of Shia Islam, whether or not it can be considered still to be Islamic in nature is a hotly contested topic. It's not unlike the debate about Mormonism and Christianity, just as an analogy. However, the Druze view the Quran as a sacred text and used its message of egalitarianism to justify both the abolition of slavery and more general social egalitarianism. This is not to say the Druze have a perfectly egalitarian society, but it is to say that they serve as an example of a non-European influenced abolitionist movement, especially seeing as they abolished slavery in the 11th to 12th century. You are welcome to disagree that the Druze count, however, and I can completely understand that perspective. \n\nHowever, the Druze aren't the only example of an abolitionist movement. Quasi-abolitionist movements have existed in some form or another throughout Islamic history. Part of the justification for these comes from liberationist readings of the Quran, with some scholars and *tafsirs* making the argument that Muhammad himself was an early abolitionist (a good modern example of this sort of justification can be found [here](http://home.insightbb.com/~adamwatson/showcase/quranslavery.html) while a good liberationist *tafsir* is the one by al-Nasafi, which can be found [here](https://archive.org/stream/TafsirAl-khazinWithTafsirAl-nasafi/tafsralqurnaljal04khziuoft#page/n0/mode/2up)(though this one is in Arabic)). These sorts of readings of the Quran rely on surahs like [Surah 90](http://quran.com/90) which has statements like: \n\n&gt; And what can make you know what is [breaking through] the difficult pass? It is the freeing of a slave.\n\nVerses like this have been interpreted as saying that the ultimate good thing a person can do is free slaves. Indeed, it has been argued that one reason the slave population in the Ottoman Empire never reached the same levels of population growth as slavery in the American South is that too many slaves were being freed for this to work (also the fact that there was a greater tradition of making slaves eunuchs). This is a very charitable reading, and I am by no means implying that it was the most common one. Far from it. However, readings such as this one did give rise to some quasi-abolitionist movements and served as the basis for Islamic liberation theology.\n\nOne problem that must be addressed with Islamic abolitionist movements is the problem that, within Islam, slaves were generally seen as being better treated than in European or American slavery. The example of the mamlukes and the elite slave class is an example of this. Part of the reason behind this relatively (and I do say relative because abuse was rampant) benign and good treatment of slaves was the proclamations of equality in the Quran and the insistence on specific treatments of slaves. Abolition attempts that focused on the brutality of slavery - which is what 18th and 19th century European and American attempts would do - were decidedly less effective because of the idea that the slaves were already being well-treated. Early Islamic anti-slavery movements often reflected this and grappled with it. For instance, the Tubenan reform movement of the 17th century in West Africa led by Nasr al-Din focused on the exploitative nature of slavery, but al-Din himself owned slaves. His particular focus was on ending the slave trade to the Americas and Europe because he saw it as brutal, while his own slave ownership was humane. However, others within the Tubenan disagreed, especially given that many of those following him had themselves been victimised by slavery. Rather than being opposed to one particular kind of slavery, these followers opposed the exploitation more generally, following the more liberationist reading of the Quran. Later African anti-slavery movements as well tended to focus on the institution of slave *trading* rather than slavery itself as being inhumane. While this doesn't quite match the image of the American abolitionist, anti-slavery movements in the Islamic world did fixate on the slave trade first. \n\nBy the mid-1800s, concrete progress was being made towards the abolition of slavery. One example is the Ottoman Empire gradually restricting the slave trade, starting by banning the slave trade through the Persian Gulf in 1847, and continuing in incremental stages from there. There are several causes of this, and one of them does include pressure from European powers, especially England and France. Both those powers exerted pressure on their colonial holdings to end slavery (though this had varying effectiveness), and also signed agreements with a variety of nations to intercept slave traders in order to stop the slave trade.\n\n However, this external pressure was not the only pressure on the Islamic powers. The 1870s saw a dramatic increase in progressivist *ulama* and an increased reading of the Quran as a liberationist, egalitarian document. Egyptian abolitionism of the 1880s, especially, focused on the rights of the lay group to freedom, including slavery as an inherent part of that thought. Sudanese abolitionism, too, could be described as a \"grass-roots movement\" with the preaching of liberation done by intellectuals and the laity. The same trends emerged in Ibadi, Shia, and Sufi Islam as well, in their respective areas. \n\nPart of the reason behind this increase can be traced to colonialism and to the idea that if slavery could be abolished in America, it could be abolished in the Islamic world as well. It also stemmed from an increased reaction against colonial powers, especially with regards to Christian missionaries being sent in to slave-holding areas by the British. However, the theology being espoused in these movements was most definitely Islamic and stemmed from an egalitarian reading of the Quran. It was not imposed by colonial powers, and it most definitely had an effect on the abolition of slavery in the Islamic world. \n\nThis is not to say that these movements were universally accepted. Conservative *ulama* reacted very strongly against them, especially in Zanzibar, Somalia, and south Asia. Numerous letters were sent from the Sultan of Zanzibar to the British Consul, arguing that the end of slavery would \"ruin these countries, and it will ruin my subjects.\" In India, the Indian Mutiny of 1857-58 was partly seen as a jihad by Shah Ahmad Sa'id to both restore the Mughal emperors and restore traditional slavery. However, others in the Indian subcontinent, such as Sayyid Ahmad Khan, Dilawar Husayn, and Ghulam Ahmad Parwez vehemently opposed slavery and promoted the liberation reading of the Quran over the next century. Ahmadi missionaries from Lahore, however, played a key role in spreading an anti-slavery message across the Islamic world in the early 20th century. \n\nWhile slavery continued to be abolished into the 20th century - and, in Mauritania's case, into the 1980s - the reasons behind it are hugely complex. Part of it does stem from western influence and pressure, that is unquestionable. However, a lot of the pressure to end slavery came as well from internal pressure and the increased popularity of reading the Quran as a liberation and egalitarian text. This increase came from an increase in the power of lay readers, outside the *ulama* and with more focus on the power of the individual. Certainly it is not the case that slavery in the Islamic world ended exclusively because of western intervention. It was a large combination of factors that came together to abolish slavery, not just one, and not just the West.\n\nFurther reading and fun sources:\n\nSlavery and Abolition in the Ottoman Middle East by Ehud R.

        "text": "All right, I admit it. This isn't just a history of masturbation. It's going to be a bit of an exploration into female orgasms and the history of sex as well. My apologies for misleading you. \n\nWe'll start with [the bad history in question](http://np.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2eaw40/did_jesus_sin_in_matthew_152128/cjxun07). There's a lot in that post, especially given that it's so short, but all that really means is that there's more of an opportunity for us to learn! And learning is fun!\n\nI'll start with the idea of sex as sin. /u/stringerbell asserts that:\n\n&gt; Since sex was a sin (and especially so if the woman enjoyed herself) you had a situation for centuries where most women were sexually frustrated, and never got to orgasm (even during sex).\n\nwhich I find pretty amusing, as it seems to thoroughly misunderstand how women's bodies actually work. That's not the point, though! The point is more that idea of sex as sin and women being sexually frustrated for centuries. I'm not entirely sure how many centuries back Stringerbell is referring to (and I'm also assuming, based on the context, that Stringerbell is looking at this in a strictly Western, Abrahamic context), so I'll go way back. Way, way back. \n\n[This](http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2014/01/sex-e1389288155331-965x543.jpg) (probably NSFW) is an ancient Babylonian carving. It's estimated to be about 4000 years old. There's more of them, including [this one](http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2014/01/2.jpg) (still NSFW) which refers very explicitly to performing oral sex. They're by no means massive carvings - [this article](http://www.timesofisrael.com/4000-year-old-erotica-depicts-a-strikingly-racy-ancient-sexuality/) describes them as \"small enough to hold in your palm\" - but they were mass produced and were fairly popular items. Sex and references to sex can be found throughout ancient Mesopotamian art and literature - the Epic of Gilgamesh even chimes in to say that sex is one of those things that makes life worth living - implying that it was hardly a taboo subject. Sex was sex, and sex was fun.\n\nWhat is my point with Babylonian sexuality? After all, the post I linked is talking about sin, which isn't necessarily an ancient Mesopotamian concept (though the Akkadian name for the moon goddess was Sin, which amuses me to no end). My point here is that it's inaccurate to assume that the people of yore weren't doing and enjoying the same things we were. I'll get into why, but remember the ancient Babylonians, and remember how much fun they were having.\n\nLet's go on to something probably more relevant to the actual post - sin and sex. Sin as a concept is not unique to Abrahamic faiths, though once again, based on context, I suspect the OP is referring to Abrahamic sin. The ancient Israelites had an interesting relationship with sex and sin. Ancient Israelite erotica is much more [toned down](http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2014/01/k-195x293.jpg) (SFW) than ancient Mesopotamian erotica, or at least that's the case for what has been found. However, this does not by any means imply that the ancient Israelites were sexless creatures. [Song of Songs](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song%20of%20Songs%201) gets pretty baudy at times, and one interpretation of it is that it's basically a wedding song that's an ode to sex. Ecclesiastes also has a few (rather depressing) [verses about sex](http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm) and its role in life. While we can't take a few verses (or a whole book, in the case of Song of Songs) as indicative of the ancient Israelite view on sex, what we can see in a combination of text and archaeology is a bit of the attitude towards it. Songs like Song of Songs do show a joy about sex and especially sex in a socially acceptable manner that - while certainly not as blatant as Mesopotamia - shows sex not as sin as such, but rather as a part of life. Does this mean the ancient Israelites were gung-ho about sex? Definitely not, but once again, don't take the laws of the Bible as necessarily being indicative of what life in ancient Israel was actually like. The Bible, as I said in my other post, is likely a prescriptive book rather than descriptive one. Even then, sex isn't condemned. Hell, the line \"go forth and multiply\" could be and often is interpreted as a rousing endorsement of sex. There were social rules regulating sex, sure, but that hardly equates to sex being a sin. \n\nThe idea of sex as sin doesn't really start to become ingratiated with Abrahamic faiths until St. Augustine. It crops up a bit in the Pauline Epistles ([1 Corinthians is probably the best example of this](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207)), but it's with Augustine that the idea of sex as a taboo really enters Christianity. According to Augustine (and Paul as well), sex and sexual desire provide a never-ending sore that detracts from an ability to interact with God. Paul's solution to this is to either be celibate or get married if celibacy is too hard. Augustine refines this - also through recognition that celibacy is really difficult - but it is the idea of celibacy and lack of sex that really shines through his *Confessions.* If it can be said that sex was a sin, it would be because of Augustine and Paul and their influence on the early Church's view on sex.\n\nBut can it actually be said that sex was a taboo? As we discussed with regards to the ancient Israelites, there is a distinct difference between what is taught and proscribed and what is actually the case in society. To skip ahead a bit, certainly by the 8th or 9th centuries, the celibate priesthood had been established and Christianity and its morality were taking hold of Europe. However, people were obviously still having sex. According to N.M. Heckel, [sex was seen as a normal part of life, but one which could turn to sin if done incorrectly.](http://www.library.rochester.edu/robbins/sex-society) Even so, brothels were ubiquitous (with some even being publicly owned by the towns in which they were located), and while the clergy may have frowned on prostitution, the average peasant probably didn't (source: Sexuality in Medieval Europe: Doing Unto Others by Ruth Mazo Karras). Literature of the time also potentially reflects a light-hearted attitude towards sex, being well-aware of the rules, but going on and having fun with it anyway. The *Decameron*, an Italian collection of poetry from 1351 is one example of this, though it's hardly the only one. To give the source of our bad history some credit, while sex in excess or in the wrong circumstances would have been seen as sinful by the pious, that was hardly a universal view. Also, sex being a sin doesn't prevent a woman from orgasming. There are plenty of examples of women having orgasms in literature as well.\n\n\"But /u/Quouar!\" you might be saying at this point. \"I was promised masturbation! Thusfar, we've had a nice overview of ancient attitudes towards penetrative sex, but where is the masturbation? I've been misled!\" Well, my dear impatient reader,  I am going to discuss masturbation, I swear (though I'm going to focus on the West because that's what my linked post is focused on). Much of what we know about the history of masturbation focuses on the male aspect of it (largely because most of history focuses on the male), but we do have historical depictions of female masturbation and the attitudes towards it. [One group of archaeologists assert that 40 000 year old cave paintings in Spain demonstrate that sex had already stopped being purely reproductive and begun to be a cultural element](http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/this-and-that/2006/5/2/12982/Cave-paintings-show-aspects-of-sex-beyond-the-reproductive), but their interpretations are disputed. At Foz Coa, Portugal, there is a carving in the rock of a man masturbating, which could be one of the earliest known depictions of masturbation. What about female masturbation, though? Some cave paintings do show women masturbating, and [this statue](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_V0EJcthPaew/TOOeY6ijwAI/AAAAAAAAHno/MmVgI7MI3Dc/s1600/Malta12.jpg) (SFW) has from Hagar Qim in 4th millennium BCE Malta has been interpreted as being of a woman masturbating. There have also been very old objects found that [could be 30 000 year old dildos](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm), though it's not clear that that was their sole purpose. We do, however, have [images of ancient Greek women masturbating](http://historia.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/olisbos.jpg)(maybe NSFW) and know that they purchased dildos made of leather or wood known as *olisbos.* Erotica preserved on the walls of Pompeii as well makes reference to both male and female masturbation. While there's a lack of depictions of medieval dildos, we do have [Renaissance depictions](http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles/a418_dildo.jpg) and know that 17th century London was a bit notorious for being a hotbed of dildo sales. Indeed, by the 17th and 18th centuries, dildos were *everywhere*, as [this](http://jessnevins.com/blog/?p=4) collection of quotes from literature and history demonstrates. In short, while there were rules governing sex, it was by no means the case that women couldn't orgasm if they wanted to. \n\nSo what changed? In the early 18th century, medical pamphlets began to be published on the dangers of \"Onanism,\" or masturbation. These pamphlets focused on the idea that masturbation produced a great number of ills and diseases, mostly due to the loss of bodily fluids. Even philosophers like Immanuel Kant got involved in the discussion about masturbation, calling it things like \"a violation of one's duty to himself\" and saying that \"a man gives up his personality ... when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive.\" Suffice to say, masturbation became seen as unnatural and unhealthy. Much of the discussion focused on male masturbation, but in 1870, we find the quote from Ellen G. White that:\n\n&gt; Females possess less vital force than the other sex, and are deprived very much of the bracing, invigorating air, by their in-door life. The result of self-abuse in them is seen in various diseases, such as catarrh, dropsy, headache, loss of memory and sight, great weakness in the back and loins, affections of the spine, and frequently, inward decay of the head. Cancerous humor, which would lie dormant in the system their lifetime, is inflamed, and commences its eating, destructive work. The mind is often utterly ruined, and insanity supervenes.\n\nFemale masturbation, too, was a taboo subject, though once again, overshadowed by male sexuality. How, then, if female masturbation was forbidden, do we get to the invention of the vibrator?\n\nThe idea of a \"pelvic massage\" to treat \"female hysteria\" is most commonly associated with the Victorians, but it dates back to well before that. Hippocrates makes reference to it around 450 BCE, and the idea of it persisted through the Middle Ages. By the Victorian era, female hysteria came to be associated with the idea of women having nervous disorders brought on by the stresses of modern life. Nearly any problem could fit into a diagnosis of hysteria, and equally, for many, the treatment was a pelvic massage. It is worth noting, though, that female hysteria, however all-encompassing it might have been, never included the idea of demons or demonic possession. Rather, it was seen as being caused by a \"wandering womb\" or through stresses of modern life, as previously stated. However, for doctors, a pelvic massage could be tedious and time-consuming, and so the need to develop more efficient and effective ways of massaging patients grew. \n\n1869 saw the invention of a massive (as in room-sized) steam-powered vibrator that could induce \"hysterical paroxysm\" in an hour. This was later followed by a roughly 40-pound battery operated vibrator that reduced the time to five minutes. However, in 1899, the first home vibrators were introduced as a household appliance, selling like hotcakes (I'll leave you with this ad from [1910](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria#mediaviewer/File:Vibration-is-life.jpg) and [this one from 1913](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/White_Cross_Electric_Vibrator_ad_NYT_1913.jpg/640px-White_Cross_Electric_Vibrator_ad_NYT_1913.jpg) as an example). Indeed, vibrators were the fifth household appliance to be electrified, having electric versions available before the vacuum cleaner or iron. However, during WWII, due to the drop in sales of all appliances and the appearance of vibrators in pornography, the popularity of vibrators dropped and didn't recover until the 1980s. Even then, vibrators were still advertised more to men than women, though the visibility and acceptability of vibrators and women's vibrator use continued to increase. \n\nThe idea of women as a deeply sexually repressed sex is not an accurate one. Women haven't had equal sexual rights, and the church did very much teach the idea of sex for reproduction rather than sex for pleasure, but that is not to say that women never experienced orgasm until the invention of the vibrator. Equally, demonic possession was not the reason behind female hysteria, nor has it necessarily stopped. Demons are still said to posses people in a variety of cultures, though the idea has lost quite a lot of popularity in the West. However, the idea of women as deeply sexually repressed I can't help but feel reflects a bit of how little is really known about women or indeed about everyday life in history. It's a fascinating thing to look at, and really, it's fun to learn about.",

        "author": "Quouar",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2efgr0/bad_historiography_and_why_the_bible_cant_be_used/",
        "text": "While doing some research, I happened across [this article](http://www.micahnetwork.org/sites/default/files/doc/library/sexuality_in_the_old_testament.pdf) about sex and sexuality among the ancient Israelites. It's an interesting enough topic, but the paper is...ah...problematic. Throughout, there are lines like: \n\n&gt; Like most religions of the Ancient West Asia, the Canaanite religion(s) were mainly fertility \ncults, which promoted debasing sexual acts.\n\nand \n\n&gt; The high regard for women in their society is another reason for the promotion of proper \nsexuality in tribal Israel.\n\nA bit presentist, isn't it? What becomes especially clear over the course of the paper as well is that it's not so much interested in exploring ancient Israelite sexuality as it is in promoting an interesting perspective that ancient Israelites were somehow more sexually \"pure\" than Canaanites. I don't really know why the author is trying to do this, but I know he's doing it badly.\n\nHowever, there's another fairly problematic aspect to this paper. The only source it cites on ancient Israelite (and ancient Canaanite, for that matter) life is the Old Testament. Now, I understand the difficulties in obtaining sources about the day to day lives of people who lived thousands of years ago, but the Old Testament is not an unbiased source. It was written by a wide variety of Israelites for a wide variety of purposes. For instance, the author says:\n\n&gt; In this society women were not objects of sexual exploitation but leaders and had an equal standing with men in every aspect of life.\n\nand cites the story of Deborah from Judges as his example. Now, Deborah is an interesting figure, but one of the reasons that she is so well remembered is because of how rare and exceptional she actually is. She's one of the only female warriors in the entire Bible, and the song of Deborah and Jael is the only one about a military victory by women. Indeed, there are some interpretations that say that because Deborah won her battle against the Canaanites, it's further evidence of God's intervention. God would be adding insult to injury by having the victory be by a woman instead of a man. Now, this is /r/badhistory not /r/arguewithQuouaraboutBibleinterpretation, so I won't get too much into Judges and what else there is in the story of Deborah and why Deborah is so awesome. My point with this particular example is that the author of the linked paper is going about using the Bible as a primary source all wrong. An example like Deborah, while interesting, must be considered in its context. You have to stop and think about why this sort of thing is so rare, especially if, as the author claims, women \"had an equal standing with men in every aspect of life.\" What should be taken from the story of Deborah is not that women were equal in all things. You could make that claim if this were a trend repeated throughout the Old Testament, but it's not. It's really, really not. Indeed, if you want a counter-example to Deborah, look no further than Ruth, where what little power Ruth has is based specifically on her ability to seduce Boaz. But once again, one example can't be used to make a statement about women's place in ancient Israelite society.\n\nWhat's also very important when using the Bible as a source of history is to keep in mind who was writing the thing and why. The paper I linked relies heavily on the prophets - and Jeremiah, especially - as sources about life in monarchic Israel. However, it's important to note *when* the prophets were likely written and by *whom.* To use Jeremiah as an example, the Book of Jeremiah starts with:\n\n&gt; 1 The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. 2 The word of the Lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, 3 and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.\n\nJeremiah is one of the books where it's mostly accepted that there was probably a historical Jeremiah and that some of the writing in the book is actually his words. Parts of it likely were written during Josiah's reforms and during the later Babylonian exile. However, it's also been heavily added to by later writers, and while some sections likely are Jeremiah, many more sections are writers reflecting on the Exile and why it happened. We talk about modern historical revisionism, but if ever there was a historical example of it happening, it's during the Jewish exile to Babylon. It's at this point that one sees writers struggling to understand what happened and coming to the conclusion that Israel was morally bankrupt and that God had forsaken them. In this context, then, Jeremiah can't necessarily be taken literally when he talks about whores and harlots. What he's referring to could be metaphorical or it could be being blown out of proportion by a man who wants to understand why bad things have happened. Understanding the author and their motivation is key to understanding the historical message behind something like Jeremiah. \n\nDoes the author of our paper do that? Nope. He plows on ahead, continuing to cite Jeremiah and other prophets as literal sources without consideration for their biases.\n\nThat brings me to my final point about using the Bible as a source of history. It's biased. It's so biased. It's written by elites (mostly, anyway) and priests who wanted to shape Israelite society. It doesn't necessarily reflect actual Israelite history and life in any way. If anything, we can see the Bible as likely being far more proscriptive than descriptive, especially of everyday life. In any prescriptive narrative like this one, of course things that the writers don't approve of are going to be exaggerated, and of course characters that behave well are going to be lauded. That doesn't mean these characters were the norm, nor should it be taken as such. Rather, what books like the prophets or Deuteronomy show is what the concerns of the elite were and what the concerns of society were. To get at the actual history in the Bible, one has to strip away the initial reading and try and see what the author was on about. Ancient texts are layered things, and simply accepting them at face value misses much of the fascinating story they're actually telling.\n\nThis paper does none of that. It's not a very good paper. I don't recommend it. ",

        "text": "Hey guys, so recently someone on my facebook [posted this little gem.]( http://www.upworthy.com/i-thought-we-banned-cocaine-for-health-reasons-nope-not-even-close?g=2&amp;c=reccon1) The video isn't too bad in some places, but I felt that it makes a lot of generalizations. My primary source for this post is [Drugs, Society, and Human Behavior]( http://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Society-Human-Behavior-Carl/dp/0073529745) by  Carl Hart and Charles Ksir. \n\n\nLet’s begin:\n\nFirst the video poses a false dilemma: How can certain drugs have been made illegal, if we still have legal drugs that that are perfectly legal, like alcohol and tobacco? This isn’t really bad history material, but I just want to note that 1) Nadelman does not take into dose-response curves at all 2) he does mention statistics, and 3) the nicotine addicts he’s talking about, were they themselves heroin addicts before? Not to mention the withdrawal symptoms of nicotine and heroin are very different. \n\n&gt; [Nicotine withdrawal is the group of symptoms that occur upon the abrupt discontinuation or decrease in intake of nicotine. The effects of nicotine withdrawal can include anxiety, depression, feelings of restlessness or frustration, headaches, an increase in appetite and difficulty concentrating]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_withdrawal)-\n\n&gt; [The withdrawal syndrome from heroin (the so-called \"cold turkey\") may begin within 6 to 24 hours of discontinuation of the drug; however, this time frame can fluctuate with the degree of tolerance as well as the amount of the last consumed dose. Symptoms may include:[52] sweating, malaise, anxiety, depression, akathisia, priapism, extra sensitivity of the genitals in females, general feeling of heaviness, excessive yawning or sneezing, tears, rhinorrhea, sleep difficulties (insomnia), cold sweats, chills, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, watery eyes,[53] fever and cramp-like pains and involuntary spasms in the limbs (thought to be an origin of the term \"kicking the habit\"[54]).]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin#Withdrawal) \n\nFurthermore, you need to keep in mind the method of the administration of the drug’s [dose-response relationship]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose%E2%80%93response_relationship) and the [route of administration]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration). \n\n[Hey, look, it’s a sexy graph!]( http://i.imgur.com/XGMr9hD.png?1) \n\nThen we get this little gem: \n\n&gt; It’s not like there was ever any kind of National Academy of Science that a hundred years ago decided that these drugs—these drugs had to be legal and these drugs illegal. \n\nHA! HA! HA! HA! Oww, my sides. It’s funny because he’s kind of right and kind of wrong at the same time. It *is* true that there was no health department [until the ‘50’s]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services), but there were predecessors and precedent for these sorts of things. The US has the [Pure Food and Drug Act]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act) passed in 1906 and the [FDA]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) was created in the same year. At the time, the Pure Food and Drug act was administered by the Department of Agriculture. \n\nLater, in 1914, [Dr. Hamilton Wright]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Wright) headed numerous international conferences centered on drug control. In 1914, [The Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Narcotics_Tax_Act) was born, and placed a tax on the This Act would tax all those who “produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in dispense, or give away” opium or heroin. The Department that looked over the administration of this act was the Treasury Department. \n\nYeah so although there wasn’t a “National Academy of Science” as Nadelman says, or even a health bureau or department, there was already a precedent with these laws and administrative bodies. \n\nThe next claim that the video makes is that health effects had nothing to do with drugs becoming illegal, it was all about *racism* and the perceived users of the drug.\n\nHere’s the thing, he’s a tad right, but just barely. Although there were certainly justifications made by blaming crime on minorities, if anything this was just a coincidental accomplice that aided in the criminalization of certain drugs. \n\n### First Drug: Opium (at around 1:20)\n\nHere’s what Hart and Ksir have to say about opiate use in the late 19th century:\n\n* By the mid-1850’s you had three types of opium dependence in the USA: you had the oral intake of opium and morphine whose use increased thanks to patent medicines, you had the Chinese on the west coast many of whom were dependent on the drug, and you had morphine injections. At this stage, Less than 1% of the US population was dependents on opium. Hart and Ksir offer us two explanations as to why only 1% was opium dependent: \n\n1.  Opium use originated with Asians, who were scorned by whites. \n2. They make the suggestion that it was caused by the quick intake of the drug itself followed by the ensuing 2-3 hours’ worth of reverie that result, thus suggesting that the intake and consequential effect of the drug itself had something to do with its lack of use. \n* After the American Civil War you had hundreds of veterans using opium, or morphine to deal with the pain. In time, more and more people became concerned about the number of people dependent on opioids, According to the text; this phenomenon became a motivator for the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act. The text also mentions a quote from one 1910 report that talks about the opium addiction seen in Civil War veterans and how it motivated the creation of the Pure Food and Drug Act. The authors also mentions that the majority of people believed that the “medical use of opioids initiated by a physician was one, if not the, major cause of dependence in the country at that time.” \n* Aft the Harrison Act, dependent users were still able to get opium via prescription, but this changed after a few Supreme Court decisions in 1919 and 1922, but a later law made it so you could get opium via prescription again although not many doctors prescribed \n* The book describes a decrease in opium abuse, although in the 1920’s, attitudes appear to shift and opium starts to be associated with crime, and the cities were especially more prone to heroin abuses. But here’s the kicker, the most obvious abusers at this point were not Chinese, but African-Americans and Latinos. As an example, the [1973 Rockefeller Drug Laws]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Drug_Laws) were criticized by Civil Rights activists for targeting African-Americans and Latinos.  \n\nI won’t deny the existence of laws targeting minorities, and I won’t deny that racism played a role in the creation of some laws (for both opium and other drugs), but I do think that there ought to be the understanding that racism was not the only factor in creating these laws.\n\n### Second and Third Drug: cocaine (at around 2:27), and marijuana (3:02)\n\nThis part is actually pretty good. But just to add to the good history itself:\n\n*Cocaine*\n\n* Between 1887 and 1914, 46 states passed laws for regulating and distributing cocaine\n* [this article has some more information on the “Negro Fiend” headline that  is shown at 2:55 in the video if you’re interested]( http://www.thenation.com/article/178158/how-myth-negro-cocaine-fiend-helped-shape-american-drug-policy). The [Actual New York Times article can be found here]( http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9901E5D61F3BE633A2575BC0A9649C946596D6CF) (which, in additional to what the video already says, also makes the claim that cocaine improves marksmanship). I personally would have focused on cocaine and anti-cocaine laws if I were going to talk about race and anti-drug laws, as well as focusing on things like the Rockefeller Drugs Laws or the early laws that were passed which were mentioned at the start of the video)\n\n*Marijuana* \n\n*Again, good history. Hart and Ksir only make reference to it being connected to violent crime, with no mention of Mexican-Americans, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the drug was linked to them with extensive discrimination going on. Just to add though, it appears that marijuana went under the radar as a sort of obscure drug used by Mexican-Americans until the mid-1920’s, at which point a marijuana--;inked crime, my text says, was mentioned in a New Orleans newspaper. By the 1930’s, use of marijuana had spread then you wound up with this association between marijuana and crime. I could go into detail about anti-marijuana campaigns and political manipulation, but I feel like that would break R2. \n\n### Fourth Drug: Alcohol (at around 3:24) \n\nAlthough the video is right in saying that some Europeans like the Irish and so forth were stereotyped as being drinkers, I again think that there are a lot of broad generalizations taking place, just like in the segment on opium. For instance, anti-alcohol movement movements and flyers can be found in 1790 with Benjamin Rush’s [“An Inquiry into the Effects of Spirituous Liquors on the Human Body and the Mind”.](https://archive.org/details/57020890R.nlm.nih.gov), as well as [some of the earlier temperance movements]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_movement#Origins). In 1874, both the [Woman’s Christian Temperance Union]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman's_Christian_Temperance_Union) and the [National Prohibition Party]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_Party) were created. This time also saw the successive passing and repealing of state prohibition laws in a number of states, until the ultimate declaration of national prohibition in 1920. The main impetus for alcohol’s prohibition appears to be the demonization of alcohol itself, and as one person put it:\n\n&gt; The liquor traffic is the most fiendish, corrupt and hell-soaked institution that ever crawled out of the slime of the eternal pit. It is the open sore of the land…it takes the kind, loving husband and father, smothers ever spark in his bosom, and transforms him into a heartless wretch, and makes him steal the shoes from his from his starving babe’s feet to find the price for a glass of liquor. It takes your sweet innocent daughter, robs her of her virtue and transforms her into a brazen wanton harlot…\n\nHowever, to be fair to Nalderman, some racial, and religious issues were certainly involved. Evangelicals and Protestants, for example, saw it as a way to put down minority groups like the Catholic Irish and Italians. Yet, at the same time, you would have to show that race and religion were their primary concern as opposed to actual prohibition. \n\nIn making his arguments solely about race, Nalderman ignores some of the history behind of these campaigns and implies that criminalization campaigns only arise when race is involved when this isn’t really the case. If anything, racism is something that gets attached to these campaigns to garner support \n\n ",

        "text": "-They immediately dismiss Cleopatra as being UGLY, contrary to popular belief. Yes. Cleopatra was stated, even by ancient sources, not to be the most beautiful woman in the history of the world. That does not mean she was not extremely attractive at the time to many people. Most importantly to Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Attractiveness in the modern concept doesn't necessarily match up with the ancient perception of beauty. It has not always meant thin people with no nose. Cleopatra's coins (in this film they say this is supposed to be an accurate portrayal, laughable) depict her as a Ptolemy, in which she has a pronounced hook nose. She was trying to associate herself with the previous greats of the Ptolemic dynasty, and that involved a pronounced beak-like nose. \n\n-Another thing, 'the psychiatrist' on the show repeatedly refers to Cleopatra as a psychopath, or displaying psychopathic behavior. Because she killed her brothers and sisters. It seems this evaluation is completely devoid of context, for for centuries the Ptolemic Dynasty had been killing eachother and incestuously marrying their siblings. A person isn't a psychopath for murdering their siblings if that is how things have worked for generations and there is no reasonable way to avoid it. Let's just use our modern conceptions of what healthy and make no attempt to, you know, understand anything and put into context the ancients viewpoints.\n\n-Another badhistory in this show, with the comic book-esque animations showing Cleopatra and her brother wearing gold crowns with a snake, or a headdress, in very Egyptian fashion. In reality, they wore the diadem , a royal headband like Alexander wore as a king. These are confirmed by her coins and busts. She wore the Macedonian diadem. Cleopatra and her dynasty was distinctively Greek, in spite of all the attempts to make her into some foreign, super Egyptian seductress in subsequent years.\n\nEDIT: Yet again, another thing. They tried to make it out as if Cleopatra and Antony fled Actium out of fear and supreme love, when in reality, they almost certainly had planned for the fleet to break out from the start. It did not work. Antony ended up abandoning his legions, while Cleopatra saved what she had left. \n\nsources *Antony and Cleopatra* by Adrian Goldsworthy \n\n\nP.S. Another couple things, they dismiss her dropping her earring into the glass as impossible rumor, where as Goldsworhty notes we know little about her size of earrings and the contents of the glass. Also, the show dismisses the affair between Caesar and Cleopatra as not about love when love could very well have been involved, we don't know. \n",

Not that it's a bad thing, I'm actually okay with the results and he still is influential today through his legacy. The debate boiled down to two candidates in the end, Jesus and Hitler. It could have been worse, one class had Lucifer and Jesus (every teacher and history student was talking about it). Also I've come to address criticisms from the last installment. You're right, I was a little too harsh in judging them. Some of them have barely stated their history courses and class has barely started this year. And my nominations weren't any better and were kind of Eurocentric. Well, I'm here to skewer two cases of bad history again today. Here's the first line that got to me and I know you guys and gals are familiar with it.\n\n&gt; \"Hitler is influential! He fixed Germany's economy and got everybody to vote for him.\"\n\nHitler didn't \"fix\" the economy, Hjalmar Schacht did. Nazi Germany's economy under Hitler and friends was pretty terrible to say the least. I'll quote /u/smileyman on the issue of Hitler getting the majority of Germany to vote for him.\n\n&gt;     He never received a majority of the vote of the German people. In 1932 Hitler challenged von Hindenburg for President of Germany, but lost[8] . In the first round of voting von Hindenburg got 49.6% of the vote, Hitler got 30.1%, and Ernst Thälmann of the Communist Party got 13.2%. Since no candidate had received a majority, a second round of elections was held, with Hitler again losing to von Hindenburg. This time von Hindenburg got 53% of the vote, Hitler got 36.8%, and Thälmann got 10.2%\nAs for the general election of July 31, 1932, the Nazis got 37.27% of the popular vote. In the November 1932 elections the Nazi party got 33.09% of the popular vote (this after massive intimidation and voter violence by the SA). In the March 1933 election the Nazis got 43.91% of the vote (this after tens of thousands of Communist Party members and leaders were jailed because of the powers given to Hitler by the Reichstag Fire Act and the Enabling Act).\nIn November 1933 there was another election, but this one was a complete farce. Hitler had already seized complete control of the government, and the Nazi party was the only legal party. Of course they finally got their majority with 92% of the popular vote.\nNeither Hitler nor the Nazi party ever got a majority of the vote.\n\nHere's one every Biblical or Near Eastern historian is familiar with. It came from somebody that objected to Jesus being number one. (I'm not sure if this breaks the moratorium).\n\n&gt; \"Guys, Jesus isn't real. So it's stupid to have him on the list.\"\n\nJosephus and Tacitus would like to have a word with this person. The works of these two attest to to the existence of a historical Jesus Christ. Tell me what you guys think.",

Anyways, my class is chock full of examples of bad history from my fellow peers. In fact, I wanted to keep them to myself but today was the breaking point. We had to debate and find an answer to one question.\n\n&gt; \"Who was the most influential person in history?\"\n\n**R.5:** I can already point out how flawed that is by subscribing to the Great Man Theory, which is a horrendous way of how to explain **world history**, where influential personages are subjective in different areas. For example, someone in Western Europe or America would say Hitler or Napoleon shaped history the most while somebody in Russia or China would state that Stalin or Mao shaped history the most. All in all, history is what you make of it. Great personages don't determine it. The masses do.\n\nA different example of bad history in the class is having to watch Guns, Germs, and Steel, be told this stinker by the teacher.\n\n&gt; \"The Incas thought the Spanish were their thunder gods because of their guns, and were so scared they surrendered.\"\n\n**R.5:** I'll direct you guys to what /u/snickeringshadow had to say on the matter of why the Incas lost at Cajamarca since I don't have the time to explain, but my god that was the worst thing I ever heard from an **AP World History** teacher. http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bv2yf/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_3_collision_at/.\n\nWell, what do you think?

        "text": "Crusader Kings 2, released a bit over two years ago, has been a kind of sleeper hit, growing in popularity over the years and making huge profits for the formerly small Paradox development studio.\n\nUnlike Civilization or Age of Empires, CK2 (like other games by Paradox) is directly tied to history, especially the history of Europe and the Middle East. All real-life rulers from 1066-1453 are playable, and the Old Gods DLC's 867 start date adds many semi-mythological Norse, Slavic, and Steppe nomadic rulers. \n\nDo you think it helps or hurts the field of history? Obviously its impact is neglible, but the game has likely influened many young people to foster an interest in the past, and informs many people about medieval history. Friends of mine who have never studied the history of the Old World are now very aware of the Mamluks, the basic history of the Crusades, the political structure of the medieval Holy Roman Empire, and certain cultural practices of Byzantium.\n\nHowever, it massively oversimplifies the medieval era and how it operated. Laws only change trivially across states. The duke of Bavaria, regardless of his power, will always be viewed as less powerful and less significant than a pagan King of Mali by his peers. Feudalism is shown as a concrete, universal system. All states in the game operate on some form of feudalism. Anglo-Saxon reeves or Arab governors do not appear. In addition, all wars, even those waged by steppe tribes or Norse raiders, are formal and declared. The losing power in a war can instantly win upon the capture of the enemy ruler or their heir. The Mongol khan can occupy half of Persia and have an army three times the size of his enemy, but if the shah of Persia manages to take the khan's young son prisoner, all Mongolian troops will pull out of Iran, and the khan will pay reparations to the khan as part of the peace negotiations.\n\nHow do you feel about CK2? Does it educate or does it harm?",

        "text": "I came across this [gem](http://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2e0886/eli5_why_have_asianamericans_flourished_while/) on the first page...\n\nSurprisingly many comments were not hateful but of course there was a lot bad history regrading Asians and Africans in America; after all, comparing Asian Americans to Black Americans is a racist's favorite talking point!\n\n&gt;Asians have overcome inequality by showing the majority in America that they can perform as well, if not better than they can in school, in the workplace, &amp; in society. Therefore it was the natural course that they have become accepted by that majority, and subsequently well-integrated, educated, and successful.\nThe African American approach has largely been based on protesting &amp; lobbying to attempt to \"force\" the hand of the majority to view them as equals. Instead of keeping low-key and working hard towards success to overcome inequality naturally, it seems as a whole they've mostly sat back and waited/demanded for the white majority to somehow fix their cultural problems for them.\n\nHow dare blacks demand White treat them as humans after enslaving them! Don't they know they must work to prove themselves before being treated like humans! And it's not like that Civil Rights movement impacted Asian immigrants in any way!\n\n\nHere is a wonderful explanation **defending** this racist response after it is called out as being racist as fuck (If you can stomach it.)\n\n&gt;I don't necessarily see it that way. I think he's more saying the two groups just went in different directions to attempt to attain equality post-slavery, one of which has been far more successful than the other.\n\n&gt;For example. A group of 10 Red Oompaloompas are living in a remote tribe in the woods. They hate both the Blue Oompaloompas and Purple Oompaloompas, who live in far away tribes. At some point they kidnap 2 Blue Oompas &amp; 1 Purple Oompa, &amp; make them their slaves. One day they free the slaves, but most of the Red Oompas still hate the Blue &amp; Purple ones - they find them inferior. The Blue Oompas did not like being hated &amp; treated as inequals, so they decided to focus on protesting &amp; convincing the Red Oompas why its unfair that they aren't treated the same just because of their color. Meanwhile, the Purple Oompa largely brushed the hatred aside, and instead decided to educate himself, and learn to hunt. Over time, he becomes a very good hunter, and the Red Oompas frequently buy his meat &amp; skins. Eventually, they begin to rely on him to help feed &amp; clothe the rest of the village. Soon, he's no longer seen as inferior, but a valuable member of the tribe. He paves the way for future Purple Oompas visited to be treated as equals.\nThe whole time the Purple Oompa was learning to be a great hunter, **the Blue Oompas spent most of their effort protesting, waiting, &amp; living off of handouts from the rest of the tribe, hoping one day the Red Oompas will change their minds**. After making a big enough fuss, they manage to get a few tribal laws passed that declare them to be equal, yet, they still cannot understand why the tribe still looks down upon them. Pretty soon, the Blue Oompas saw the Purple Oompas' success, and saw them as the enemy, no different than the Red ones. In time, they grew tired of protesting &amp; became apathetic. When would the Red Oompas let them succeed? If only they opened their eyes, they would see that the key to overcoming inequality &amp; being looked at as inferior, was as simple as working hard to contribute an equal, or larger role in the tribe, just like the Purple Oompa.\nEver stop and wonder why most businesses in black neighborhoods are owned &amp; run by Asians? If society doesn't give you equal opportunity, you have to create your own.\n\nIt's almost as if some of the Red Oompas..er white people... didn't actively try to stop black Americans from succeeding. [It is almost like they didn't burn down their businesses and hospitals.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot)\n\nHere is the whole thing:  http://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2e0886/eli5_why_have_asianamericans_flourished_while/cjusuqi\n\n\nEDIT: [TIL separate drinking fountains were the extent of Black oppression in America.](http://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2e0886/eli5_why_have_asianamericans_flourished_while/cjuypgu)\n&gt;Hey remember when we put blacks in internment camps in the 40's because racism?

One that forgets Islamic discoveries in architecture, mathematics, philosophy and medicine. With an introduction like this, you know it's only going to go downhill.\n\n&gt;Christian holy wars really only appeared after the western world interacted with Arab jihadists.\n\nEven if this were true, it was the *Turks* who were the target of the First Crusade. Not the Arabs. The Arabs were allies of the westerners. Unless this guy means Charles Martel, in France? But those weren't Arabs either.\n\n&gt;The loss of papyrus through Egypt destroyed much of western literacy.\n\nMuch of western literacy was already destroyed when the western Roman Empire fell. And that was because of Arian Christians, not Muslims. And, by the time Muslim forces took Egypt, it didn't have many links to western Europe anymore anyway.\n\n&gt;They destroyed all remnants of the Roman empire and this way [sic] and ended Byzantium later.\n\nThe western Roman Empire was pretty much done with before Islam came onto the scene. What exactly should we understand by \"remnants\" anyway? We still have the Coliseum, for example. That's a pretty sizeable \"remnant.\" Alternately, depending on your interpretation, the western Roman Empire remained. It morphed into the Holy Roman Empire until that was finally wiped away ba Napoleon. (Note: Napoleon was most likely *not* a Muslim.) \n\nThe Byzantine Empire was a victim of its own internal problems, invasions from the Turks (who also trashed the Arab world) and later the idiocy of the Fourth Crusade where western Christians sacked Constantinople. True, Byzantium \"recovered\" and limped on for a couple hundred years more, but Islam was not solely at fault.\n\n&gt;Since the arrival of Islam, there has been nothing but war on her borders.\n\nWe've literally been in a 1,400 year world war? With not a single moment of peace? There have also been many years when there was nothing but war on the border of Christian nations, Hindu nations, Buddhist nations and on and on. There have also been extended ages of peace. Is Indonesia (the world's most populous Muslim country) currently at war with someone I'm unaware of? Morocco? \n\n&gt;Nations under her heel languished. \n\nTrue of any nation occupied by a foreign power. But also untrue if you look into a little thing called the Islamic Golden Age. \n\n&gt;Books of knowledge destroyed, histories rewritten. \n\nActually, the Arab Muslims tended to preserve books of knowledge. See again \"Islamic Golden Age.\" The Crusaders were actually seen by those in the Levant as ignorant savages (cf. *Memoirs of an Arab Syrian Gentleman and Warrior*) Without Islam we may never have known who Aristotle is. And histories are constantly being re-written. It's the nature of historical research. \n\n&gt;Eastern Europe turned to genocide in places when Islamic violence became too large for them to capably deal with. \n\nDoes he mean the genocides during the breakup of the Yugoslavian republic? Because that was just a clusterfuck of everyone killing everyone else. You can't blame that on just the Muslims. ",

It was the first painting of its kind to have someone smiling in such a way, so it was sort of a new era.\n\nThe Mona Lisa is the first ever picture to have someone with a slightly amused but generally enigmatic facial expression? I mean, it's totally different to the expression in Van Eyck's [*Portrait of Jan de Leeuw*](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Jan_van_Eyck_-_Portrait_of_Jan_de_Leeuw_-_WGA7609.jpg), right? That work only precedes Leonardo's by 80 years. Fucking *epochal* shit right here!\n\n&gt;The brush strokes. He used strokes so small, they were damn near invisible, creating a very 'photographic' painting in a time when that wasn't really done.\n\nI could probably do this whole post with Van Eycks. Do you see any brush strokes in the [*Madonna of Chancellor Rollin*](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Eyck_madonna_rolin.jpg)? Of course you fucking don't. Do you see them in Grünewald's *[St Anthony Visiting St. Paul the Hermit in the Desert](http://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/matthias-gr%C3%BCnewald/st-anthony-visiting-st-paul-the-hermit-in-the-desert-left-wing-of-the-isenheim-altar-1516.jpg)*? Not a chance! Do you see brush strokes in the work of Leonardo's contemporary Giorgione, who worked in a similiar sfumato style in pieces such as [*Portrait of a Young Man*](http://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/820/flashcards/1610820/png/giorgioneportraitofaman1338877693959.png)? Do you see them in Raphael's [Portrait of Pope Julius II](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Pope_Julius_II.jpg)? No. Do you know why? Because there were no fucking impressionists in the early Renaissance! Also, he didn't use 'tiny brushstrokes'. He layered and blended the wet oils, probably with his fingers (fingerprints believed to be his have been recovered from the surface of *[Lady With an Ermine](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Dama_z_gronostajem.jpg/640px-Dama_z_gronostajem.jpg)*).\n\n&gt;Street Cred. Leonardo Da Vinci was an extremely talented guy, the quintessential renaissance man. He was a genius, and is thus rightly given praise.\n\nGhost of a point. Leonardo is indeed idolised as an archetypal genius, and has been (on and off) since the time he was actually alive.\n\n&gt;Time. This painting took four years of Leonardo's life to make.\n\nIt took Henry Darger 62 years to write *In the Realms of the Unreal*. Also, this is not in any way a particularly remarkable length of time to work on an oil painting. It's a painstaking process and a lot of it is, quite literally, watching paint dry. It's not like Leonardo shut himself up in a room and did nothing else for four years either.\n\n&gt;Subject. Nobody's entirely sure who he's portraying, which is pretty weird for portraits. Usually, portraits like this one are commissioned by the person depicted, but it doesn't appear this was for anyone but Leonardo. Is it a girly version of him? A prostitute? A secret lover? Or just something out of his head?\n\nIt's not at all weird to not know who is the subject of a portrait, especially in this era. We don't know who is the subject of most of Van Eyck's portraits (we don't even know *which* Arnolfini is the subject of the Arnolfini portraits). We don't know who Durer's *[Young Venetian Woman](http://www.friendsofart.net/static/images/art2/albrecht-durer-portrait-of-a-young-venetian-woman-1.jpg)* is, who Bronzino's [*Young Man With a Book*](http://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/agnolo-bronzino/portrait-of-a-young-man-with-book.jpg) is or who Raphael's [*Young Woman with a Unicorn*](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Raffael_046.jpg/640px-Raffael_046.jpg) is.\n\nAlthough, interestingly enough, [we do know who the subject of the Mona Lisa is.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_del_Giocondo)\n\nThe entire comment thread is one of the worst comment threads about art and art history I have ever seen on reddit, and that *is* an achievement.",

        "text": "Someone brought Schama up in the mindless monday thread, and I started writing a reply about why his history is so bad, but it ended up a bit bloated. So, here's a small selection of errors from Simon Schama's Citizens in its own post.\n\nWe're told that in the 1780s Jacques-Pierre Brissot was\n\n&gt;something of a professional lobbyist for liberal causes like the liberation of black slaves in the West Indies. \n\nAnd here's what Brissot himself had to say about it in 1791:\n\n&gt; In conclusion I must, for the hundredth time, correct an error, I should call it a lie, written in a letter by a M. Mazères, calling himself a deputy of the provincial assembly of Saint Domingue. Too often one looks only at their pain, he says, when one debates the question of freedom for the blacks. This question has never been raised. I challenge M. Mazères to quote a single work by the Society for the Friends of the Blacks where it is argued. This perfidy is constantly used to mislead the people. \n\nHow dare Simon Schama spread such vicious lies... \n\nOn Robespierre and his speeches appealing to the innate goodness in humanity, Schama brings some analysis \n\n&gt;These lessons in moral earnestness he had learned from his lawyer father. \n\nRobespierre's father abandoned him and his other three children soon after the death of their mother. Robespierre, the eldest, was six at the time. \n\nIn the winter and spring of 1793-94, there was a conflict between the different groups within the revolutionary leadership. One of these groups is hit by a corruption scandal, and Robespierre-\n\n&gt;believed and still wanted to believe that Danton himself was not implicated and, learning of his wife's death in early February, wrote a touching letter to him in the warmest terms, appealing to their old friendship. What he was asking of Danton, in fact, was that he desert his corrupt friends and adhere to the fiat of the Committee. \n\nRobespierre's supposed political motivations here are a bit of a stretch, considering that Gabrielle Danton actually died in February the year before. The error is a bit bizarre, since 4 pages earlier Danton is said to be \"enjoying domestic pleasures with his second wife\" in November. \n\n&gt;Commenting on the revolution of the tenth of August, Robespierre had rejoiced that \"a river of blood would now divide France from its enemies.\" That river was now swelling its banks; the current was flowing fast but it remained obscure, except to the intimates of the Incorruptible, where it was taking the Republic. \n\nHere, he's attributing a quote by Danton to Robespierre, as well as mangling it. \"The Parisians are screwups. A river of blood has to be put between them and the émigrés\" is what Danton was supposed to have said, with some minor variations between sources. So, to summarize; it wasn't Robespierre, the quote wasn't referring to the fall of the monarchy (August 10), and there wasn't a lot of rejoicing involved. \n\nThere's an excerpt of a pretty funny dialogue from the trial of Charlotte Corday in 1793,\n\n&gt;Montané: Didn't you practice in advance, before striking the blow at Marat?\n\n&gt;Corday: Oh! The monster [i.e. Montané], he takes me for a murderer! \n\nMontané was the president of the revolutionary tribunal at the time. The person who was actually involved in this exchange was the public prosecutor, Fouquier-Tinville.\n\n&gt;To Hébert's accusation that he, Camille, had married a rich girl, he responded with an act of candor designed to win Robespierre's applause, declaring that this \"fortune\" his wife brought him consisted precisely of four thousand lives. \n\nIt's never a good sign when someone just takes a politician's word on the state of their personal finances. The note in the bibliography that said politician's writings should be \"experienced without any critical mediation\" doesn't inspire much more confidence. Schama manages to be doubly incorrect here, translating \"rente\" (meaning pension) as \"fortune\". Camille Desmoulins really did get only 4000 livres as regular income, but what both he and Schama fail to add is that his wife's dowry was worth 120 000 livres. This is pointed out in the commented edition by Henri Calvet that Schama says to experience the text without. \n\nWe get a picture of a guillotine with the inscription \"traitors behold and tremble this will only lose its activity when you have all lost your lives\", and Schama turns it into \"Traitors, look at this and tremble. It will still be active while all of you have lost your lives.\"  \"But she has failed\" becomes \"but now it's her neck that's missing\". What makes the last one worse is that it's the lyrics to the Carmagnole, one of the most important songs of the Revolution.\n\n&gt;The case against Marie-Antoinette (and in fact virtually all of those who followed her to the guillotine during the Terror) was much the same. She was, essentially, impure in body, thought and deed.\n\nAccording to Twelve Who Ruled by R.R Palmer, half of those executed during the Terror were sentenced as armed rebels. And insurrection isn't very virtuous from the state's point of view, so clearly the executions were all about purging impurities. \n\n&gt;Marie-Antoinette was not the only woman at about this time to be incriminated for conspiring against the Jacobin ideology of obedient wife-mother.\n\nThe actual charges against her was for treason, which she had actually committed. I guess conspiring to overthrow the state really did clash with the Jacobin ideal of womanhood, but it's pretty safe to say that they would have put a man on trial for the same things that Marie Antoinette was suspected of.\n\nHe concludes the book with a nasty jab at Théroigne de Mericourt, who was a prominent revolutionary early in the revolution. In 1793 she was attacked and almost lynched by political enemies, and she withdrew from public life after that. In 1794 she began showing signs of mental problems, that have usually been attributed to injuries from the beating. She was taken to a mental institution and was kept there until her death in 1817. \n\n&gt;Clothes had become abhorrent to her, so she sat naked in her cell, angrily refusing even the simplest wool dressing gown offered to protect her from the winter cold. On the rare occasions when she emerged for air or to drink from the filthy puddle that formed in the courtyard, she consented, sometimes, to wear a light chemise but nothing more. Every day she would throw cold water on the straw of her bed, sometimes breaking the ice in the yard to get at it. […] Sympathy seems out of place here, for in some sense the madness of Théroigne de Méricourt was a logical destination for the compulsions of revolutionary Idealism.\n\nSo it wasn't a blow to the head that caused her illness, or the other theory that it was caused by syphilis. No, it was *idealism*. Phew, good thing we settled that, I almost felt bad for a woman who suffered for over twenty years. ",

Mr. Arun Shourie has written extensively on the pollution of our text books, much thanks to our commie seculars of course, in \"Eminent Historians: Their Technology, Their Life, Their Fraud\" an amazing read I tell you.\n\nFor an R5:\n\nI will quote my summary of a chapter of Edwin Bryant's *The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture* (in which he is referring to the disputes on the Aryan Invasion theory—such disputes of a similar nature litter virtually the entire field of Indian historiography).\n\n[Original link](http://np.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianHistory/comments/29g4du/ancient_indian_historiography/)\n\n&gt;* The Aryan invasion debate in India is intensely relevant to the\nconstructions of several very different sets of competing identities:Hindu and Muslim, indigene and foreigner, Aryan and Dravidian, and Hindu\ncommunal and Marxist secularist are all permeated in one way or another with a variety\nof notions connected with Aryan origins.\n* There is a tendency to stereotype any local reconsiderations of ancient Indian history\nwhatsoever as nationalist or communal,which is often unfortunate.A\nwide variety of motives inspire Indian scholars to revisit the topic of Indo-Aryan ori-\ngins: it is erroneous to lump them all into a simplistic, hastily identified and easily\ndemonized Hindutva category.\n* Nationalist historiography is *not* necessarily bad. It has stimulated asking questions about local cultural and ethnic configurations that would not have occurred to colonially oriented archaeologists. It has brought different assumptions, perspectives,and concerns to the data, exposed colonial predispositions and imperial biases.\nOn the negative side, nationalism has encouraged the misinterpretation of archaeological data for political purposes and ignored important aspects of human history Archaeological interpretation can reinforce and articulate the centralizing policies of emerging nationalisms, as well as be used to legitimize ethnic cleansing or territorial expansion.I'm citing Harke (1991) here.Silberman(1995) also suggests a similar thesis.\n* Now, voices challenging the *invasion* thesis,Indian or foreign,need *not* be communal,which they unfortunately tend to get stereotyped.This is not to say that there are people who seek \nthis theory for very overt politics.\n* To be considered a real Hindu, a person's religious faith\nmust have an indigenous origin.-is the crux of Savarkar's Hindutva.The problem with this seemed to be that it appeared to exclude native Muslims and Christians on the virtue of the fact that their prophets were born on the wrong side of the Indus. This[ideology of Hindutva] has a number of consequences in the way these people have dealt with the Aryan *Invasion* theory.\n* Extreme versions of this have lead to all sorts of nationalistic nosenscical viewpoints,like *England* was *Angulisthana* originally or *Arabia* was *Arvasthana*,or Muhammad was a Hindu(of the sort produced by PN Oak) to include Muslims as 'Hindus' and thus,Indian citizens.Similar nonsense is spouted by Tamil nationalists as well.\n* Hindutva ideology(since I'm talking about it here) can be easily pressed into service in alienating and targeting the Muslims and other minorities in communally volatile, modern-day India.(Hock,1999;Habib;1997,Ananth;1998)\n* However,there is  a tendency in Western, and in elements of Indian, academic circles to a priori stereotype everyone reconsidering this aspect of Indian history in such ways(like fascists and Nazis:This is particularly strong in places like the universities of Delhi),which has been greatly vexing to scholars like Colin Renfrew, B B Lal,etc.\n*The point is that: themes resonating with Hindutva, that is, the prioritizing of Hindu culture as the indigenous, and therefore legitimate, heir to hegemonic power in India (with its anti-Muslim subtext), while blatantly and distastefully present in a number of publications, does not pervade the views of all the members of the Indigenous Aryan school.\n* You've already mentioned Arun Shourie ,and the controversies in the Indian Council of Historical Research.The \"Left-liberal\" or \"secular Marxist\" stereotype is subject to an amount of disgust equal to that of the colonial stooge in Indigenist discourse. Rajaram (1995) states that \"in the hands of politically driven historians of post-colonial India, these nineteenth century-creations [viz., arguments supporting the Aryan invasion theory] have become handy tools to be used in support of their vested interest in Marxist ideology and the version of history that goes with it\" (xiv). 20 Secular Marxists are accused of maintaining a defunct theory in order to insist that the arrival of the Aryans is analogous to the arrival of the Muslims, Christians, and numerous other groups of newcomers to the subcontinent. In such an amalgamation of immigrants, no one has more claim to indig- enous pedigree or cultural hegemony than anyone else. A secular state, from this perspective, is the only political system that can protect the equal rights of all citizens to define themselves as being Indian with cultural credentials that are as good as anybody else's.\n* Thapar's comments are portrayed as \"vintage Marxist rhetoric,\" which has \"gratuitously drag[ed] in the bogey of the 'Aryan nation' . . . [as] a blatant attempt aimed at divert-\ning attention away from the real issue\" (Rajaram 1993, 33). Thapar (1996) finds Rajaram's writings \"read rather like nineteenth century tracts but peppered with ref- erences to using the computer so as to suggest scientific objectivity since they claim that it is value-free! Those that question their theories are dismissed as Marxists\" (88). From another perspective on the other side of the debate, and in interesting contrast to Thapar's concern about a single \"Aryan nation,\" Talageri (1993) raises the alarm about multiple Marxist mininations: \"The first principle of Leftist propaganda is that India is not a nation but a conglomerate of nations. . . . the rationale behind this is that if India breaks up into small \"nations,\" these would be easier for the Leftists to gobble up one by one\" .  \n**Both sides of the debate sometimes refuse to even acknowledge that there is a legitimate controversy,sadly.**\n* An example of the ridiculousness this reached: The entire proceedings at the plenary session of the prestigious 1994 World Archaeological Congress in Delhi came to a complete (and ridiculous) standstill for more than thirty minutes as \"leftist\" and \"rightist\" historians actually clambered onto the dais, physically wrestled each other in attempts to snatch up the microphone, and hurled abuse into the air in front of over two hundred flabbergasted foreign delegates.\n* Detractors of the Indigenist school can be just as selective in the views they extract for critique, as the Indigenists they ridicule. Habib (1997) caricatures all the Indigenous Aryanists as believing that the Dravidian language family is not distinct from the Indo-Aryan one—a view held by only a very few individuals and not at all representative of the Indigenous position.Scholars like Satya Swarup Mishra(linguistics at BHU) who abhor Hindutva,face immense frustration at this stereotyping.\n* There is no indication that the British consciously exploited the Aryan theory to create a divide-and-rule situation between the North and the South. However, whatever may have been the motives of colonial scholars or missionaries, the dichotomy was most certainly put to political use by separatist voices in the South of India.(Tamil Nationalism,theories of Kumari Kandam,etc).\n* Western scholars are often caricatured as discouraging the tribes and\nlower-ranking castes from identifying with Brahman-dominated Hinduism, gaining their sympathy, and offering them a new set of loyalties in the form of Christianity.\n* There are a number of scholars who outline the arguments in favor of the\nexternal origin of the Aryans, as well as the arguments that oppose it(in contrast to the shrill and often unpleasant and exclusionary *Hindutva* polemicists), but leave the issue unresolved—in other words, the Indigenous Aryan position is treated on equal terms with the standard version of events: \"European scholars have been trying to prove that the Aryans came to India from outside and their guesses have extended to all sorts of places like Scandinavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Russia, Turkey, Central Asia and Armenia. But any of these places cannot yet be said to really be the homeland of the Aryans. We are still in the realm of speculation and are likely to remain so\" (Vidyarthi 1970).Also see RC Majumdar. \n* A third category of writers gives the Indigenous Aryan school equal and respectful time but passes a verdict against them(Like Kosambi and Luniya)\n* A final category—more ideologically sensitive and, as as has\nbeen exemplified earlier, usually stereotyped as the Marxist camp—actively opposes the Indigenous Aryan school.\n* Ancient Indian pre- and protohistory is an extremely rich and fascinating area of\nstudy, but, unfortunately, the origin of the Indo-Aryans has become inextricably enmeshed with the politics of representation. There is every reason to be concerned that if the Vedic Indo-Aryans are interpreted as being indigenous to India, then the Vedic \"civilization\" and all that developed from it will be construed as \"truly Indian\" and all subsequent cultural groups known to have immigrated into India could explicitly or implicitly be depicted as \"Others.\"\n* If you ask me about what position *I* take on this stance,I'd be leaning towards Majumdar's position,or a bit more towards Kosambi's That\nthey are open to different interpretations does not at all mean that the Indigenist position can carry the day. But, to my mind, it does mean that an Indigenous position merits a place at the table.\n\n\n&gt;This is from the chapter 'Aryan Origins and Modern Nationalist Dialogue' from Edwin Bryant's 'The quest for the origins of Vedic Culture'.\n\n[A criticism of 'Eminent Historians](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/book-review-of-eminent-historians-by-arun-shourie/1/265372.html)\n\nSome quotes from there:\n\n&gt;This book, with its leering wink at Eminent Victorians in the title, commences with a series of expose-like chapters (which have already been printed in large measure elsewhere) in which Shourie details the petty financial and other misdemeanours of the historians who ran the Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) in the '80s and early '90s.\n\n&gt;This is sordid stuff, in which a number of Marxist and left historians emerge very poorly either for having accepted projects on which they have not delivered or for having patronised dishonest clients. Shourie neglects to mention though that some historians today closely associated with the BJP were once members of the very clientelist networks manipulated by the \"leftists\".\n\n&gt;Shourie has the ego and anecdotal reasoning of Nirad Chaudhuri married to the writing style of Robert Ludlum. Both are in ample evidence in this book. But serious thought of any variety has been replaced by spleen, hysteria and abuse.\n\nMy take on this: The basic point that Shourie raises is valid, but the book has no real analysis of *why* history writing in India is in the poor way it is.The main point gets submerged in bile.\n\n\nOh,and the current Indian government does not seem to be interested in any scholarship,even from the political right.They appointed a fellow at the Indian Council of Historical Research who claims that the caste system was actually quite good for everyone and the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were totes real.\n\nInstead of appointing actual historians(who are not Marxist) ,and are right-leaning. :like [M Chidananda Murthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Chidananda_Murthy)",

Either things happen by accident neither planned nor caused by anybody, or they happen because they are planned and somebody causes them to happen. In reality, it is this 'accidental theory of history' preached in the unhallowed halls of ivy which should be ridiculed.\" \n\nHe later goes on to describe the process of explaining conspiracy history to the \"unlearned\" as being **like Columbus trying to explain that the world wasn't flat**: \"...People were afraid they would lose social prestige if they listened to him. Many others just did not want to believe the world was round. It complicated too many things. And typical flat-earthers had such a vested interest involving their own egos that they heaped abuse on Columbus for challenging their view of the universe. 'Don't confuse us with facts; our minds are made up,' they said.\"\n\n\nI don't even know where to begin. \n\nR5 EDIT: This is bad history because history is not either conspiratorial or accidental, nor did Columbus put on a \"hey guys, the world isn't flat\" presentation and was \"abused\" for it. I was certainly never taught that everything in history happened accidentally.\n\nR5 EDIT #2: The wise and discerning author informs me that pre-WWI, the German government took out ads in New York magazines urging people not to board the Lusitania because it was a munitions vessel and would be attacked, but they didn't listen because submarine warfare was a non-issue until it was made to be an issue by the media.

(Incidentally, that video depicts the best possible way to make money as a street performer in Edinburgh. Just as a fun fact)\n\nThe Edinburgh Fringe has tons and tons and tons of shows about everything and anything. One show I went to see was [\"The Story of Medieval England from 1066-1485 at Roughly Nine Years and Two Gags per Minute, Featuring the Hundred Years War as a Football Match and of course, Scottish Independence\"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BuwZou6CEAQUYiz.jpg). It struck me as the sort of thing I might enjoy (and he was offering a free biscuit!), and so I wandered in, fresh-faced and ready for fun. There were a number of questionable things that stuck out at me - the football match commentary version of the Hundred Years War, for instance, seemed to rely too heavily on the idea that the Hundred Years War was, in fact, a hundred years - but one in particular stuck in my mind. When the fine Mr. Edwards began to discuss the Battle of Bannockburn, he played some bagpipe music as a soundtrack, implying that bagpipes could be considered part of the battle or at least part of the story he was telling of Scotland in 1314.  Now, Mr. Edwards seemed to be rather knowledgeable about history - certainly he seemed to be having a good time with it - and if that's the case, then I like to think his choice of soundtrack was done with full awareness of the hornets' nest he was stepping into. It could also be that he just grabbed the most Scottish-sounding thing he could think of, in which case, I feel completely justified in calling him out on it.\n\nYou see, there's some controversy surrounding the Battle of Bannockburn and bagpipes within it. It's a controversy with historians and their evidence on one side, and Scottish clans and half-destroyed bagpipes on the other. It's a long and sordid tale.\n\nFirst, though, let's have a bit of a look at the history of the bagpipe, just to better understand why there is a controversy over the Battle of Bannockburn. Bagpipes are not unique to Scotland, having existed in some form or another for at least as far back as the Romans (there are references to Nero playing an instrument with a bag and a pipe, for instance), and possibly as far back as the Hittites. To be clear, this is not necessarily the same instrument that you would find a busker playing on the streets of Edinburgh, just the same concept - making a ton of noise with a bag of air isn't exactly a novel concept. Pipes can be found across Europe and throughout European history in some form or another. [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes#mediaviewer/File:Santes_Creus_Bagpiper.JPG), for instance, is a sculpture of a piper in Spain, completed in the mid-13th century. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYd9xY8hQ3Q) is an Italian traditional instrument called the zampogna, and which is substantially older than the Great Highland Bagpipe. One major distinguishing feature of various types of bagpipes - and a way to tell the evolution and age of them - is the number of drones. The zampogna, for instance, can have anywhere from three to zero drones, varying with geography. [This](http://www.music.iastate.edu/antiqua/bagpipe.wav) is the sound of a medieval European bagpipe with a single drone. Modern Great Highland bagpipes have two drones. You now know way more about bagpipe construction than you ever wanted to.\n\nAnyway, the Battle of Bannockburn. One of the issues with bagpipes at the Battle of Bannockburn is that it's not entirely clear when bagpipes were introduced to the British Isles and what form they took. We know they're [explicitly mentioned in the Canterbury Tales](http://www.bartleby.com/40/0103.html) (line 565) written around 1380 or so, though what form these pipes took isn't clear. John Derricke's \"The Image of Ireland\" from 1581 also includes an illustration of [a dead piper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_Irelande#mediaviewer/File:The_Image_of_Irelande_-_plate09.jpg). This heavily implies that, by the 16th century, at least, pipers were travelling with military companies. George Buchanan offers that the first record of bagpipes being used in battle comes from French records of the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh (one of my contenders for most unintentionally amusing battle names) in 1547 where the pipes replaced a trumpet, though other historians assert that John Hastie played the pipes at the Battle of Flodden. An even earlier reference to \"warpipes\" can be found in 1396 regarding the Battle of the North Inch, taking place in Perth. It's also worth noting that in 1362, there is a record of 40 shillings being paid to the king's pipers, though once again, it's not entirely clear what sort of pipe they were playing. All of this, though, is well after the 1314 Battle of Bannockburn. While historical data does suggest that the bagpipe was at least present in the British Isles in 1314 - after all, if it's being recorded in 1380, it likely wasn't a brand new thing - whether or not it was used in battle is another question entirely. Certainly it's likely the case that even if it were used, it wouldn't look or sound anything like the modern incarnation we know and love.\n\nEnter Clan Menzies and their [Bannockburn Pipes](http://ericdentinger.com/cariboost_files/menzies_bagpipe.pdf). Much of the controversy about whether or not bagpipes were present at the Battle of Bannockburn stems from this one crumbling family relic. According to Clan Menzies, they own the actual set of bagpipes that were present at the battle, thus demonstrating the fact that bagpipe music would have been played at the battle. One problem with this, though, is that this bagpipe would be substantially older than any other surviving bagpipe, making it unlikely that it's the actual bagpipe. It's also worth noting that other families - such as the MacDonalds - make similar claims about mouldy bagpipes they have. However, the Menzies bagpipes are interesting enough and certainly old enough to warrant a discussion, and have most definitely caused some controversy regarding the history of piping. \n\nRegardless, though, a 14th century bagpipe would not have had the sound of a 16th century Great Highland bagpipe. It's not until the early 17th century that many of the most recognisable bagpipe tunes would come into existence (part of a style of music known as *pibroch*, which had started on the harp and changed to the pipes). It's this music that you or I might recognise as Scottish bagpipe music, as it involves the type of bagpipe that one sees everywhere with two drones. Certainly things like [modern Scottish marching tunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epLgvrYbdSg) would not have been heard at the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\nAs far as the actual debate goes, it's unlikely that Clan Menzies has an original set of pipes used at the Battle of Bannockburn. There's also little evidence to support the idea of pipers marching with an army, but equally, there is some circumstantial evidence to support the idea that there *could have been pipers*. Ultimately, though, Mr. Edwards' bad history is playing two drone, modern bagpipe music while talking about the Battle of Bannockburn. Such music would most certainly not have been heard there, contrary to his insinuations. While one must appreciate someone trying to be properly Scottish, this is not the music that would have been heard at the time.\n\nAlso, doing football commentary on the Hundred Years War is better in theory than in practice.

Medieval societies also weren't famous for their generous welfare policies.\n\n&gt;If you were totally incompetent, you were bumped to a different part of the chain.\n\nThis is entirely wrong in *two* ways. Firstly, saying this like it's something modern culture lacks is absurd: If you suck at your job, you get fired. That's one of the cornerstones of capitalism right there. It's also something that pre-capitalist society *lacked*. There's a reason that absurdly incompetent kings were kept in power until they were assassinated: Because position was granted by blood, not by ability.\n\n&gt;It was also a time of hierarchy, roughly by ability, that allowed a concentration of the best leaders at the top of the aristocracy\n\n*Woah*. What part of the concept of 'aristocracy' doesn't this guy understand? One moment he's telling us that position was granted by blood rather than ability, and the next he's saying that the aristocracy is meritocratic. I have no idea how to respond to this. It's a direct contradiction of terms.\n\n&gt;Given that they handled political crises that would devastate modern societies\n\nYeah, another thing that's just wrong. We aren't constantly fighting succession or other political or religious wars like they did back then, at least in part because we abandoned the whole 'right to rule' thing. \n\n&gt;Rituals like courtship, funerals, blah blah blah were imbued with a sense of import and gravitas that no modern ritual has\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's worth missing out on the whole 'fall in love get married and never divorce' thing to get strange concepts like civil rights and modern medicine.\n\n&gt;Governance was more flexible because it was composed of ... largely independent lordships.\n\nWhile the premise (largely independent lordships) isn't exactly wrong, the idea that this led to innovative governance is kinda probably entirely wrong. Progression in governance typically revolved around *erasing* the influence of the nobles in favour of the monarch, the bureaucracy or the parliaments, like in Britain and Russia, whereas states where nobles were given the most flexibility and power such as Hungary or the Polish Commonwealth found themselves immobile and collapsed. I don't think there's a single example of a state where powerful independent lordships led to effective, competetive and progressive governance.\n\n&gt;What I like about medievalism is that society was not viewed as a vehicle for self expression but a shared effort based in a single idea.\n\nWhat, like every single society ever that isn't based on western liberalism? Like all the fascist, communist, theocratic, totalitarian, or tribalist societies that have ever existed? Why on earth does a non-individualist society require a return to arbitrary and effectively useless rule by undeserving nobles?\n\nAnd that concludes me pointing out the totally obvious.\n",

        "author": "rakony",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2dk0if/an_islamophobe_looks_at_mongol_history/",
        "text": "Right I came across [this particular piece of drivel](http://www.historyofjihad.org/mongolia.html) when flicking over to /r/history where some guy had enough brains to notice something amiss and ask for a response. [At first my reaction to the article went along these lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-v1TTUyhM). However I then had some fun typing up a sweary response which I shall now copy paste over here.\n\nOk I'm the resident expert on the Mongols in the Islamic world over at Askhistorians and I can tell you this is bollocks. He's twisiting and misrepresenting facts, and in some cases outright lying, to fit his agenda. This is actually so bad I'm going semi-systematically and crush all the most egregious bullshit he's spewing. What I don't touch don't assume to be true though, while some of his comments are factual others seem pretty doubtful but I lack time/specific knowledge to refute.  \n&gt;Many Muslim historians look upon the Mongols as looters and plunderers. They tell us that the Mongols were like the Goths and Vandals, destroying everything in their way with the only aim to loot established rich civilizations. These historians allege that the civilization of the Muslims at Baghdad was the richest in the 13th century. This is wrong, while Baghdad was a rich and well endowed city, the Caliphate owed its riches to the constant looting of Persia, Central Asia, North Africa, Spain which the Muslim armies had been indulging from the beginning of Islam in 630 C.E., till they were checked by Charles Martel in France in 732 C.E. and till their brutal march across Central Asia towards China was reversed with equal brutality by the Mongols from 1200 C.E.  \n\nGeneral misrepresentation of the Islamic conquests as one organised campaign. Hints of Islamophobia and implication of forced conversions in the line he has above which purports to be from a religious jurist claiming the need to “convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force\". This ignores the lines in the Qu'ran forbidding forced conversion, albeit it occurred occasionally, and the fact that actually Islam only slowly became a majority religion in the new Islamic states. Indeed for a while there were attempts to stymie conversion by the Ummayds for a variety of social reasons.  \n\n&gt;Genghis Khan was the man who led the Mongol attack on Islamdom. He was followed by his grandson Hulagu (or Halaku) Khan. These two bold visionaries liberated all of Persia and most of Mesopotamia from the yoke of Islam and almost destroyed Islam.  \n\nWhat a lovely mix of idiocy and islamophobia it rises to my head like the smell of fermented shit. The idea that the Mongols liberated the people from the Yoke of Islam is fucking laughable. Early Mongol occupation is marked by intense exploitation of the settled populace so that it is actually known as The Mongol Yoke, hardly liberation. The idea that they sought to destroy Islam is ridiculous as well. Yes Hulagu did end the Caliphate in Baghdad eventually but this was part of general Mongol conquest not some plan to eliminate Islam. Mongol religious policy was marked by tolerance, or more accurately pragmatism. Large numbers of Muslim officials were co-opted into the Mongol administration, and may rose very high as the Mongols liked appointing them to rule over Chinese cities as they were less likely to set up their own powerbases amongst the inhabitants and instead be reliant on the Mongols. Furthermore as with all religions in the empire Islamic temples and priests were exempt from tax. Why this was the case is debated the main theories being the Mongols hedging their bets on a cosmic scale or seeking to buy loyalty in an influential section of society.  \n\n&gt;Genghis Khan’s intention was not primarily to loot, but to destroy the enemy. Had the Mongols been motivated purely by intentions of looting the Caliphate (which ironically was itself a center where loot was collected and stored by the Muslims), the Mongols need not have traversed some four thousand miles from their homeland in Mongolia, to reach Baghdad, they could have as well attacked nearby Japan and Korea which were hardly a few hundred miles from their homeland and were more rich and endowed than Baghdad.  \n\nThis is a pile of shite. The Mongol invasion of the Islamic world was not some attempt to avenge themselves against Islam. The original impetus was the massacre of Mongol emissaries/spies by the governor of Otrar. This provoked Genghis so much that he broke off his campaign in China, leaving the Southern Song able to survive for a few more decades, to attack. Furthermore if Genghis' original plan had been to avenge himself against Islam why the fuck had he been invading China?  \n\nThe only assault on a Muslim power prior to this had been the invasion of the Kara-Khitai khantae which happened for its own reasons, and certain events that occur during the invasion completely contradict the authors false narrative of a historic Mongol resentment of Islam. The Khara-Khitai khanate did have a majority Muslim population. However this was clearly not why it was invaded. The khanate was invaded as the last major figure who had opposed Genghis unification of the Mongol tribes under his banner, Kulchug the Naiman, had fled there following his defeat and subsequently taken over the kingdom. By invading the area Genghis Khan was merely shoring up his control of his armies. Furthermore Kulchug was a Buddhist who was actively persecuting his Islamic subjects (perhaps he din't quite get Buddhism) and one of the Mongols first acts was to end this persecution of the Muslims. So this alone proves the idiocy of the supposed historical resentment of Islam. But I'll trudge on through this mire of moronity.  \n\nFinally the claim Genghis could have looted richer places closer to home. I suppose the Silk Road didn't exist and Central Asia wasn't one of the greatest crossroads of trade ever, my mistake. Lets ignore the legendary wealth of the Central Asian and Iranian cities controlled by the Kwarezhim Shah. Admittedly when the second wave of conquest came and took Baghdad, which happened almost a century later under Hulagu, Baghdad was no longer quite the prise it once was. However Syria and Egypt which lay beyond most certainly were and the Mongols needed to solidify their Middle Eastern border against the Mamluks.  \n\n&gt;We shall examine this in detail the chapter on the Mongol resistance to Islam, before some of the Mongols themselves succumbed Islam and carried forward the Muslim tradition of subterfuge and savagery to other non-Muslim people.  \n\nCharming. No hint of anti-Islamic bias at all. Also as said before there was no concerted resistance to Islam. Indeed like all religions in the empire it occupied a privileged and protected position.\nThe next section on religious influences of Christianity amongst the Mongols is actually ok. However as said to claim this motivated the invasion the Islamic world is great honking bollocks. The religious practices of the area remained predominantly shamanistic and syncretic.  \n\n&gt;People in Bukhara opened the city's gates to the Mongols and surrendered. Genghis Khan told them that they, the common people, were not at fault, that high-ranking people among them had committed great sins that inspired God to send him and his army as punishment.  \n\nThe mercy stemmed from the Mongol policy that those who surrendered immediately were spared, and those who resisted massacred, this was a form of pyscholgical warfare that served Genghis well. also whether Genghis actually claimed to be the wrath of god is pretty dubious. It's probably apocryphal.\n&gt;To begin with the Mongols did not partake in the gruesome displays that Muslim rulers often resorted to elicit fear and discourage the Mongols - none of the patented Muslim torture and mutilation practices that had been happening under Muslim rule happened initially in Bukhara or Samarkand which were overrun by the Mongols. Only after the Mongols were provoked by Muslim torture like stretching, emasculating, belly cutting and hacking to pieces, were the Mongols far more ruthless than their Muslim foes and that led to the wholesale slaughter of Muslims by the Mongols at Baghdad.  \n\nErrrrm what? While you'll often see me arguing that the estimated death toll of the Mongol Conquests is often greatly exaggerated this piece is still stupid. The Mongols had no issue with massacring populaces as stated above when briefly discussing their psychological tactics. To claim otherwise is a lie.\n\n&gt;Wanting no divisions rising from religion, he declared freedom of religion throughout his empire. Favoring order and tax producing prosperity, he forbade troops and local officials to abuse people. \n \nHe's right about freedom of religion although this does undermine his point about some sort of deep historical resentment of Islam. The claim is such an obvious idiocy he even contradicts himself. As for the bit about administration while the rules may have been there in theory they were largely ignored or circumvented. We don't really see the Mongols shift from exploitation/extortion of settled populaces until Mongke Khan.\n(cont. in comments below)",

I intentionally linked to this comment.\n\nWell, that's got that cleared up.\n\nNow, aside from Russia [officially recognizing that the Katyn Massacre was carried out by the NKVD under direction from Stalin,](http://en.ria.ru/russia/20101206/161655377.html) and [officially condemning him for this crime,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11845315) there's still apparently some 'doubt' about who really did it.\n\nAt least according to /r/socialism.\n\nNow, there're some problems here. \n\nIt is true that Goebbels did see the discovery of the mass gravesite in the forest near Katyn as a grand opportunity to fuel his propaganda machine with the verifiable horrors of Soviet bolshevism, and issued a radio announcement in 1943 attributing this discovery of this massacre to Soviet action during its 1940 occupation in accordance with its pact made with Germany.\n\nThis was actually what happened, though they hadn't yet discovered the true extent of it. Stalin utterly denied it, and in retaking the region blamed the Nazis.\n\nHowever, this doesn't account for why we have a official testimony from a 1941 direct meeting between Soviet and Polish officials, including Prime Minister Sikorski and Joseph Stalin, in which it is said that Stalin assured that all Polish prisoners taken had been freed, though notes that a significant discrepancy due to some suspected thousands missing was due to having lost them somewhere near Manchuria. That evidence, of course, is circumstantial. \n\nWhat isn't circumstantial, on the other hand, is that we have a [document from Stalin himself discussing the killing of Polish soldiers near Katyn,](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Katyn_-_decision_of_massacre_p1.jpg) as well as an official document signed by Stalin and members of the Soviet Politburo directly ordering the mass killings. Less damning, but still pretty suggestive, is the fact that the Soviets began a cover-up operation in the areas of the mass graves following their retaking of the Katyn area in 1943. Or the fact that their commission sent to thoroughly investigate the area in 1944 was called the suspiciously prematurely-resolved Special Commission for Determination and Investigation of the Shooting of Polish Prisoners of War by German-Fascist Invaders in Katyn Forest.\n\nJust by [looking at the titles alone of the relevant literature on the topic,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre#Further_reading) it's pretty clear who most researchers today agree was guilty.",

Most of the things this guy claims are dubious at best but the final statement is patently false \"there has never been a non-Jewish state in Palestine\"? How can anyone actually say that with a straight face? I mean he jumps from 63BC to \"Present day\" skipping 2000 years of history; look at 5:00 min! This is just laughably lazy. Does the Abbasid Caliphate not count as an arab state? What about the Ottomans? Does their empire not count, they weren't Arab but they certainly weren't Jews. There is no way this guy has a graduate degree from Columbia University's Middle East institute if he can't think of a single non-jewish state in the Levant, I can't take anything he said seriously and neither should anyone else.\n\nThat's just the low hanging fruit, really there is so much more lazy reasoning going on here. He is intentionally over-simplifying the entire issue. It completely disregards the history of the region, Arabs had long been seeking self governance after hundreds of years of colonial rule and were understandably upset when a Jewish state was imposed on them and already felt slighted by the powers that be for renegging on the promises made by T.E.

To quote and refute at length:\n\n&gt;Here we go. Let's see if I get downvoted to hell or not. I like to see things from all angles and make them comparable to current events. I don't personally fly a confederate flag and I wouldn't ever do that because it's a bad principle. But let's just see ***why* the confederates did what they did and why what they did is good for us today.**\n\nOff to a good start. /sarcasm\n\n&gt;This country is founded on the belief that if a government is too overbearing and takes away your rights that you can revolt and overthrow the government to reform from the ashes a better government. That's how America was formed and that's what it's based upon. Our rights are set out to us in the constitution.\n\nMore or less true. The right to revolt gets a bit tricker than that, but this is consistent with the overall points of the Founding Fathers, taking them by and large.\n\n&gt;In those days, black people didn't have constitutional rights. Neither did women. We realize that this is wrong today, and I'm glad we live in a world where we can realize just how wrong this is. But at the time... They didn't realize how wrong it was.\n\nWomen did have constitutional rights, just not suffrage. 'Free' black persons did not have equal protections under the Constitution, while slaves had none. To say *they didn't realize this is wrong* is a bit in error, as by 1861 plenty of people did, albeit still a minority. There's also a distinction between advocacy of equal legal protection, and equality more broadly speaking.\n\n&gt;In fact, to them, that was how the world worked. That was what was fair to them - to the confederates, it was their \"right\" to own a slave. Which means when the northern government came in to abolish slavery - in the eyes of a confederate, the government was becoming overbearing and taking away their \"rights\" to own a slave.\n\nUpon the beginning of secession, to which this person is presumably referring given the following sentences below, this is untrue. The federal gov't had no interest on the whole in ending slavery. Republicans wanted to prevent its expansion, which to the southerners meant its eventual death. As an immediate consequence, they mostly feared the growing abolitionist tide in the North (which was still a minority) agitating slaves to revolt. John Brown, for example.\n\n&gt;So they revolted. They literally did what the founders of this country asked them to do. They revolted when government became too overbearing and took away their rights.\n\nThey didn't revolt as such, they seceded, which is not in accordance with what the founding fathers advocated. I believe several of the users here or over in /r/AskHistorians (no brigading!) have pointed out how Madison himself directly stated that secession wasn't a valid option, while affirming the right to revolution. And that's just one example.\n\n&gt;They are the reason why Americans are free to this day. They are the reason African Americans have rights. They are probably a good part of the reason why women have rights as well, but I can't say.\n\nSure, I guess it becomes a question of just what that reason it. I'm going to guess ahead of time that most of us will disagree with it.\n\n&gt;Let's start with why they are the reason African Americans have rights. Without their ignorance, I don't believe equality would have been pushed so far.\n\nWhose ignorance? I'm not sure I'm reading this right.\n\n&gt;If they didn't go so far as to revolt and form a new government and a civil war over owning slaves, then equality wouldn't have gotten the attention that it did.\n\nPlausibly, but it seems rather baseless. At least, not a verifiable argument.\n\n&gt;Lincoln himself owned slaves for years before the civil war.\n\n[No he did not.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1yo4as/abraham_lincoln_owned_slaves_btw/)\n\n&gt;Northerners owned plenty of slaves.\n\n'Northerners' if you include the border states, which were 'Southern', just not Confederate.\n\n&gt;Lincoln, and the U.S. Government, wouldn't have gone so far in pushing for free slaves had there not been a rebellion from the south.\n\nAgain, probably true, but this isn't much of a thing to credit the Confederates with, as it's an unintended consequence of their extreme, opposite intentions for which they were willing to have their people killed in large numbers for several years.\n\n&gt;Because let's face it - at the time, nobody really gave a shit about equality and you're lying to yourself if you think otherwise.\n\nIt's arguable that Lincoln did 'at this time', although definitely more towards the end of the war. That's rather tenuous, however, and probably requires taking equality to mean something other than what this person means it as. Still, he's forgetting the radical wing of the Republican Party, as well as abolitionists not already part of the radical Republican faction.\n\n&gt;If Lincoln had said, \"WOOHOO SLAVES ARE FREE\" and everyone went along with it, there would be slaves to this day. But because of the rebellion, Lincoln had to full on pursue freeing slaves. Because the south had just called his bluff. So they contributed heavily to equality as we know it.\n\nNo, they indirectly precipitated legislation guaranteeing legal equality in spite of their actions. Suppose you had a defenseless child and Adolf Hitler standing next to each other, and a guy with a hockey puck several paces away ready to aim and throw. You can't really credit the guy for hitting Hitler if he put every bit of effort and strength into pegging the defenseless child, even if that's what he did. Intentions matter here. (This is **not** a comparison in anything other than intent. We **can't** refer to slaves as either defenseless or children, or deny their efforts in bringing about abolition.)\n\n&gt;Now, on to the part where they have kept us free. I sincerely believe that the freeing of slaves was a stepping stone by the government as to how much power they can impose before rebellion starts. \n\nOk, but this guy's arguing that without any proof. I haven't seen anything linking abolitionism to some litmus test to see what 'the federal government' (as if that's itself a coherent body) can get away with.\n\n&gt;Let's face it: very few of the gun toting people who say \"I keep this ak47 to protect me from domestic government enemies takin away my freedoms\" would actually use that same weapon if government officials decided that everyone must give up all weapons and allow soldiers to board in their homes. \n\n&gt;But the government won't do that - because they can't be sure that there won't be rebellion if they take away out rights. Because not too long ago, they took away the southerners \"rights\" to own a slave, and there was a brutal and long war that the north almost didn't win.\n\nI'm gonna skip that one.\n\n[Section removed do to its political rather than historic substance]\n\n&gt;In all, the second civil war was positive and I in no way support slavery. \n\nI'm not sure you can call a war 'positive' because of its effects. It's still a bad thing, even if it had certain positive consequences.\n\n&gt;But they were ignorant at the time and thought it was their rights - and stood up for them.\n\nBut they were shitty rights and the Southerners were still in the moral wrong for standing up for them. This is just a useless platitude.\n\n&gt;We should be  thankful because they helped contribute to the rights of equality and also to keeping the government at bay.\n\nThis person just said that the war/abolition served as a stepping stone for the large-scale expansion of the powers of the federal government, entirely contradicting the overall argument \"Southerners did something positive here indirectly,\" as this is an example of them indirectly doing something \"negative\" in this person's view. It's entirely inconsistent, in addition to being problematic due to the factual accuracy of how much the Southerners really cared about states' rights in principle.\n\n&gt;TL;DR racist southerner confederates actually contributed to freeing slaves and equality for African Americans. They also contributed to the freedom that you enjoy on a daily basis - and they died defending your civil liberties. If you care enough to read this tldr you should read the whole thing, because this tldr can't possibly cover every point that I covered above.\n\nBlah.",

Since the book looked right up my alley, I got ready to hand over all my money as soon as I saw it.\n\n[And then I read the back of it.](http://imgur.com/uRrSQiT)\n\n&gt;The taking of the Bastille, the attempted escape of Louis XIV, his fall from grace, the advent of the Republic, the Terror... All this is well known.\n\nThe attempted escape referenced here is usually called the Flight to Varennes. It is indeed well known, though this book reveals some shocking new information. In 1791, the royal family attempted to flee from Paris in order to meet up with their allies in Montmédy. With these allies, and their armies, they were going to retake France, and restore the monarchy to its former power. They were stopped in the town of Varennes on June 21, by a postal worker called Drouet, and forced back to Paris. It was a major turning point in the history of the monarchy, since the king was suddenly revealed as a threat to the revolution and the security of the government. \n\nFor the first time, there were organized calls for the monarchy to be abolished. This was all very unfair, since poor Louis was entirely innocent. Though not for the reasons occasionally believed by the more gullible at the time. He wasn't kidnapped by evil conspirators, like the National Assembly tried to spin it. Louis XVI wasn't even there at all. It was his great-great-great-grandfather, Louis XIV, previously thought to have died in 1715. Sun King? More like Douche King. \n\nThe next year, the monarchy was abolished. In January of 1793, Louis XVI was sentenced to death and executed. One of the charges against him was his attempted escape. Goddammit, Louis XIV. ",

        "text": "[Link.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/2d9ckg/krugman_phosphorus_and_freedom_how_does_a/cjno13j)\n\nThis is my first /r/badhistory post so bear with me here.\n\nOh goodness, where to start with R5.\n\n&gt; I didn't say non-libertarians did... I said one person did... Statism IS a religion though... it is venerated, blasphemers are ridiculed, its has rituals(voting), Tithes(taxes), Divine law no one can violate, Priests(politicians, bureaucrats), evangelism(spreading \"democracy\"), indoctrination(schools) etc...\n\nWell, first and foremost, \"statism,\" or the belief that the heirarchal state is a desirable system of social organization, is not an arbitrary religion with no basis in reality.  [The state system emerged historically as an extension of the desire for enforcible contracts, a chain of command to create accountability, and avoid a state of nature](http://what-when-how.com/social-and-cultural-anthropology/state-anthropology/).  You know, nasty, brutish, short, etc.  It is hardly an unexamined religious maxim; it proves its utility every day.\n\n&gt; There has never been a complete free market but there have been times when markets have been allowed to operate semi-freely. Consequentially these are the times when the most wealth is created for all where standards of living multiplied immensely, ie 17th, 18th, 19th century America\n\nWhile I don't want to get into the discussion of what constitutes a \"free\" market, the notion that free-er markets were the sole reason for growth and rising quality of life during the 17th-19th century is incredibly revisionist.  First is the obvious question \"for whom?\"  Sure, white, well-to-do, land-owning males were living it up.  [But that \"tell\\[s\\] us nothing about the 40 to 50 percent of adult free males and the 30 to 40 percent of families who possessed no wealth other than clothing, tools, a little furniture, and perhaps some farm animals.\"](http://www.nber.org/chapters/c8009.pdf)  Meanwhile, \"[t]he data for wealth suggest that half of adult free males held real estate in 1798, and that this proportion decreased to .41-.43 in the period from 1850 to 1860\" (ibid).  [Not to mention gender inequality that was perpetuated by markets' desire to use women as cheap, less-skilled labor.](http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/2?e=barkbrief-ch08_s03)  [And do I even have to mention racial oppressions necessitated by these supposedly \"wealth creating\" markets like slavery that put minorities decades or centuries behind whites?](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424300247.html)\n\n&gt; NO, before child labor laws, market innovation was VASTLY decreasing the REAL NEED(that did exist) for child labor (which still exists BTW)... government just does what it always does and swooped in at the end and says \"ha, we did it!\" The fact of the matter is that child labor laws weren't imposed until 1938 DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION.... By 1930, only 6.4 percent of kids between the ages of 10 and 15 were actually employed, and 3 out of 4 of those were in agriculture..... When this occurred families went hungry because due to already heavily regulated industry they could not make ends meet without having their children work...people actually died after child labor laws were enforced during the depression when families needed to do EVERYTHING they could just to survive... and actually the whole \"7 year olds don't work for pennies a day in coal mines\" thing is primarily a farce.... most child workers did menial tasks that smaller hands were suited for... Which would you rather do? Shell out 100s of dollars for a computer tech to fix your computer or pay a 12 year old cents on the dollar that he would be happy to have???\n\nIn regard to child labor, as has been shown in other bad history posts, [markets were not hopping all aboard the \"get rid of child labor\" train](http://www.eiu.edu/eiutps/childhood.php).  In fact, Congressional attempts at were repeatedly stymied by business interests, who often relied on the cheap, unaccountable labor to maximize profits.  [\"Not until the Factory Act of 1833 did things improve.\"](http://www2.needham.k12.ma.us/nhs/cur/Baker_00/2002_p7/ak_p7/childlabor.html)\n\n&gt; NO, they are not... Businesses want to make money... they want to serve to the most customers they can... unless they are modern idiots that wont preform a homosexual wedding or something... BUT that is their right! Government has NO PLACE dictating who business owners can serve... racists exist... let them be racists. The market will deal with them and they will go out of business when all they can serve is other racists... Dont eat at there lunch counter... ITS PRIVATE PROPERTY... Thats like FORCING someone into my house that I dont want there... Segregation was GOVERNMENT policy... \"Jim Crow\" laws were government mandates... businesses fought heavily against segregation policies and owners were often arrested for defying them... most developed a \"back door\" system or had employees deliver to minorities on bicycle routes to skirt the law...\n\nIn regard to segregated lunch counters, the idea that business owners' desire to make money trumped their innate racism is just plain false.  Segregated in most cases didn't mean \"whites here, blacks over there,\" it meant \"whites everywhere, blacks get off my property.\"  They said that they shouldn't have to serve blacks [because it was their \"private property\"](http://www.timwise.org/2010/05/rationalizing-white-supremacy-racism-free-markets-and-the-morally-obtuse-rand-paul/) and their richer white customers would prefer to eat in a whites-only diner.  [Have people already forgotten the Greensboro sit-ins?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins)\n\n&gt; Dont really understand this also, or imagine why anyone that knows anything about libertarianism would feel this way... It is government that draws the line. It is government that endows others with special privileges... and it is under the auspices of government that the greatest atrocities in human history have been perpetrated.... 260 MILLION NONMILITARY(not counting war) MURDERS BY GOVERNMENTS IN THE 20TH CENTURY ALONE[3] - and these are JUST WHAT CAN BE DOCUMENTED... How can anyone STILL defend this institution...\noh but many say those were just bad governments.... we can control governmnt, we can make it good if we only got the right people in there... lol and libertarians are called utopians...\n\nThe last one I'll mention is the misuse of [this](https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM) link to argue that monolithic \"government\" is the cause of \"greatest atrocities in human history\". Democide is simply a generic term that applies to state violence against non-state actors.  This would be like saying \"murder\" is the greatest cause of inter-personal death.  It is categorically true, but explains little and means even less.  Obviously, failed policies like the Great Chinese Famine are categorically different than, say, the deliberate and targeted Holocaust, and neither can be said to be \"perpetuated\" by the mere existence of a structured state.  Revisionism, question-begging, etc.\n\nThere's plenty more goodness there, but most of it is related to the theory of libertarianism itself, rather than a specific application of bad history.",

        "text": "Forgive me if I am misunderstanding the nature of the subredit. In the last few years as my studies in history have expanded, I have read an increasing amount of secondary works on various periods of history and about half the time I find things that really stand out as strange.  Carl Sandburg's work on Abraham Lincoln stands out.  (http://www.amazon.com/Abraham-Lincoln-The-Prairie-Years/dp/0156027526). \n\nReading a book on the election of 1920 (http://www.amazon.com/1920-The-Year-Six-Presidents/dp/0786721022)  1920: the year of 6 presidents by David Pietruza I noticed that he referenced the income tax amendment as the 17th amendment. Now, this could just be a typo, or this could be an event of astounding failure to fact check.  Not sure.\n\nReading a book for a Civil Rights class called \"A new deal for Blacks: the emergence of civil rights as a national issue in the decade of depression\" by Harvard Sitkov (http://www.amazon.com/New-Deal-Blacks-Emergence-Depression/dp/B0091K2P80) he was astoundingly wrong about the republican party platforms from 1916-1924 which I was very easily able to pull up. Now, I have to wonder why such a document was hard for him to find. \n\nDo these count as bad history? \n\nEdit 1:\n\nAs requested, I am editing my prime post to bring it in line with rule R5\n\nI am going to append to my list on Sitkoff two issues. 1) His claim that the 1912 republican party platform lacked civil rights, and 2) A quote by William Howard Taft which was massivly taken out of context to make him look anti black. \n\nSitkoff's claim. \"The GOP, for the first time since 1868, shied from adding even a splinter of a civil rights plank to its party platform [in 1912]\" (pg 15 of the book I linked)\n\n\nyet here at http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29633 you can clearly see the following:\n\"The principles of constitutional government, which make provisions for orderly and effective expression of the popular will, for the protection of civil liberty and the rights of man, \"\n\n\n\"In dealing with these questions, it is important that the rights of every individual to the freest possible development of his own powers and resources and to the control of his own justly acquired property, so far as those are compatible with the rights of others, shall not be interfered with or destroyed\"\n\n\n\"We approve the action taken by the President and the Congress to secure with Russia as with other countries, a treaty that will recognize the absolute right of expatriation and that will prevent all discrimination of whatever kind between American citizens, whether native-born or aliens, and regardless of race, religion or previous political allegiance. The right of asylum is a precious possession of the people of the United States, and it is to be neither surrendered nor restricted.\"\n\n\n\"We call upon the people to quicken their interest in public affairs, to condemn and punish lynchings and other forms of lawlessness, and to strengthen in all possible ways a respect for law and the observance of it. Indifferent citizenship is an evil against which the law affords no adequate protection and for which legislation can provide no remedy.\"\n\n\nThis is far more than a splinter, this is a good chunk of a whole trunk.\n\nClaim 2, a quote by Taft \"political children, not having the mental status of manhood\" refrenced as happening in 1908 cited on page 15 of the book.\n\nHowever, http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19060405&amp;id=vmgsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xskEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6907,3219836\n\nThis is a paper from April 4th 1906 which puts the quote into context. On page 5 of the paper, 2nd column (not counting the column of ads) we get the rest of the quote \"When a class of persons is so Ignorant and subject to the oppression and misleading that they are merely,\"  \n\nthis is where the quote starts \"political children, not having the mental status of manhood\" and it continues \n\n\"then it can hardly be said that their voice in government secures any benefit to them\"\n\nNow, researching this quote I found only a handful of citations on line, all identical, and strangely many citing different dates. Finding the original in a speech to the 25th anniversary celebrations of Booker T Washington's school at Tuskegee might have been harder back when the book was written and maybe Mr Sitkoff just used the first source he could find, but it is still bad history to edit a quote to turn a pro Black speech into an anti black one.  \n\n\n",

        "text": "Over in /r/History, there's a thread titled [*Between 1901 and 1960, nearly every independent country experienced at least one coup. The U.S. is one of the four exceptions, but Nixon may have come close. By 2010, the number of countries without a coup for at least 50 years was up to 22.*](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2d53ji/between_1901_and_1960_nearly_every_independent/)\n\nThis isn't about Nixon coming close (I mean, what?), but rather about several comments asserting that the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy was a coup orchestrated by then-Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson, as a means for Johnson to seize the reins of government. Several users in the thread make mention of this, although (happily) most of these comments have been downvoted. The most telling comment is this:\n\n&gt;We may never know for sure, but lots of credible people believe the [Johnson administration](http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/22/roger-stone-nixon-thought-lbj-killed-kennedy/) was a coup.\n\nThe link is to a Daily Caller article from 2013. The Daily Caller, for those not in the know, is a conservative muckraker website with [somewhat questionable journalistic integrity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Caller#Controversies). In this case, \"lots of credible people\" apparently means various folks allegedly quoted by Roger Stone, author of [The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ](http://www.amazon.com/The-Man-Who-Killed-Kennedy/dp/1626363137) and the subject of the Daily Caller interview. \n\nIn the interview, Stone claims, among other things, that\n\n* Jack Ruby was an \"operative\" employed by Johnson since 1947, and was ordered to do \"clean-up work\" after the assassination\n* Johnson was at the end of his career and desperate, \"on the verge of political execution at the hands of the Kennedys,\" who had despised him for being nominated as Vice President in 1960.\n* Lee Harvey Oswald was not a leftist, but rather a deep-cover CIA/FBI/military intelligence operative.  \n\nNow for the R5, largely taken from the [webpage of John C. MacAdams](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/home.htm), a political science professor and expert on the assassination. Warning, it’s *very* late 90s web design. :P\n\nStone is, of course, merely among the latest in a long line of conspiracy theorists making wild and wacky claims about the assassination. None of his allegations are new. Indeed, the notion that Johnson was behind the assassination is old news; according to [Max Holland]( http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/holland3.htm), in 1966 a letter came to light that had allegedly been written by Jack Ruby in prison, wherein Ruby fingered Johnson as the mastermind behind the “coup.” The letter is likely either fake or the product of an unsound mind (see below).  \n\nDuring the time that Stone alleges Ruby acted as Johnson’s “operative,” Ruby was actually nothing more than a bit player in the Dallas-area underworld. Although it has been alleged numerous times that he was somehow connected to large-scale organized crime (in particular, the Chicago crime families), testimony at later legal proceedings showed that he had [little, if any, significant contacts]( http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ruby3.htm) with important figures in organized crime. Rather, Ruby was merely a [sleazy nightclub owner](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ruby4.htm) who had constant [legal and financial troubles](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ruby6.htm) in the years immediately preceding the assassination.  \n\nAnd although he apparently believed there was a conspiracy, Ruby repeatedly denied that *he* had been a part of some coup attempt against Kennedy. At any rate Ruby was arguably paranoid and delusional, at least at the time he was interviewed by investigators for the [Warren Commission](http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/oralhistory.hom/Warren-E/Warren-e.PDF), and possibly at the time of the assassination as well. According to Earl Warren, Ruby believed that there *had* been some sort of sinister conspiracy to kill Kennedy, as part of some U.S. government persecution of Jews that was tied to larger issues in the Middle East; Ruby even believed that Jewish women and children were actively being tortured and murdered in the prison where he was confined (see p. 16). No one really knows why he shot and killed Oswald two days after the assassination, and we’ll probably never know. \n\nThe idea that Johnson’s career was somehow in danger from the Kennedy brothers’ machinations, or that he and the Kennedy brothers were implacable political foes, is just plain silly. Johnson was very successful during his twelve years in the U.S. Senate, before he resigned to become Vice President. He was “the least senior Senator ever elected to this position, and one of the least senior party leaders in the history of the Senate,” as well as an unusually powerful and effective Majority Leader.  [Source: Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson#Senate_Democratic_leader) \n\n**EDIT: WARNING! I slipped into bad history myself here. Feel free to bombard me with rotten fruit!**\n\nAs for the 1960 VP nomination, there’s no way Kennedy could have been elected without the support of Southern Democrats. The Kennedys deliberately [brought Johnson onboard as VP candidate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1960#Democratic_convention) to solidify this support, and the election was still [very close]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1960).  On his own merits, Johnson positively *destroyed* Barry Goldwater in the [1964 Presidential election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1964). \n\nFinally, regarding, Oswald, there is no credible evidence that he ever acted as an intelligence agent, received intelligence training, or held high-level security clearances. As part of its report on the assassination, The House Select Committee on Assassinations [thoroughly investigated](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/oswald5.txt) Oswald’s background, including his military records, and found such suggestions unsupported. \n\nNot that any of this will satisfy conspiracy theorists….\n\n\n\n",

Historians, in their ignorance, have apparently been blinded to the fact of the greatest (non-existent) trend in history:\n\n&gt;No historian ever wrote about the global long-term (exponential) decline in violence from pre-historic times to today. Why not? It's probably the most important historical development ever so surely historians should understand it best, just like they understand the lack of scholarship in the Muslim world, right?\n\n&gt;But the answers to those questions come from a scientific mindset that understands sociological and psychological principles. That is why a cognitive scientist had to write a book on why violence has declined by taking data from historians who didn't know how to explain their data sets.\n\nhttp://www.np.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2d1d40/neil_degrasse_tyson_on_skepticism_conspiracy/cjloekr\n\nThis obviously refers to Pinker's *Better Angels*, which already has an entry on the askhistorians wiki. However, digging through those threads, I only found one link with a direct response to Pinker's arguments, which was a piece in Z mag by Herman and Peterson:\n\nhttp://zcomm.org/znetarticle/reality-denial-steven-pinkers-apologetics-for-western-imperial-violence-by-edward-s-herman-and-david-peterson/\n\nI think we need to make an anti-Pinker/*Better Angels* compendium because this keeps coming up so often. Here are a couple of others I've found on the book:\n\n-R. Brian Ferguson on how he cherry-picked the archaeological data:\n&gt;So let us look back over Pinker’s list. Of the original 21, Gobero, Niger is out because it has no war deaths. Three cases, the burial ground across the Nile from Site 117, Sarai Nahar Rai, lndia, and Calumnata, Algeria are all eliminated because they only have one instance of violent death. One site each was dropped because of duplication in Brittany,\nsouthern Scandinavia, and California. That leaves two-thirds of the original List. 14 exam-ples, which purportedly represent average war mortality among 'prehistoric people.' Jebel Sahaba, the two cases from the Dnieper gorge, and Indian Knoll are all highly unusual in their very early dates and number of casualties, when compared to other contemporary locations, including 117's neighbor’s cemetery (see Ferguson, chapter 11). Three European\nsites are from the Mesolithic, which has gained a reputation for violence compared with earlier and later cultures, and two of those are from the Ertebolle tradition, which has an established reputation of being especially violent even within the Mesolithic. Four cases (compiled from many more individual sites) are from the Pacific coast. British Columbia, and Southern-Central California, all of which have higher levels of violence than any other long-term North American sequence, and which still show great variations by time and place. The final three are from Illinois and South Dakota or thereabouts, which, even dur-ing the most violent centuries in the entire sequence of prehistoric North America, stand out at the extreme points of warfare killings. \n\n&gt;Is this sample representative of war deaths among prehistoric populations?\nHardly. It is a selective compilation of highly unusual cases, grossly distorting war's antiq-uity and lethality. The elaborate castle of evolutionary and other theorizing that rises on this sample is built upon sand.\n\nhttp://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/sites/fasn/files/Pinker's%20List%20-%20Exaggerating%20Prehistoric%20War%20Mortality%20(2013).pdf\n\n-Quodlibeta blog on his reliance on flawed population stats for Medieval murder rates:\n\n&gt;Are the figures accurate? Here we run into a number of problems. You might have noticed that the homicide rates are highly dependent on the population statistics. Michael Prestwich discusses this in Plantagenet England 1225-1360 (p507-508). One estimate he quotes is that London in the first half of the fourteenth century had a homicide rate of between 5.2 and 3,6 cases per 10,000 (equivalent to 52 per 100,000 and 36 per 100,000 meaning London was as violent as present day New Orleans). However this estimate was based on the population of London being 35,000 to 50,000. It’s become increasingly clear that these estimates are wrong. For example it’s clear that building densities around Cheapside were extensive by the end of the 14th century – at levels not reached again until 1600 when the population was 100,000-200,000 including suburbs. According to Prestwich estimates of the city's population now reach as high as 107,900 to 176,000. At a population of 100,000 the murder rate would be 1.8 per 10,000 (18 per 100,000). This would make London’s murder rate equivalent to present day Atlanta or Pittsburgh. A slightly higher population estimate would make the murder rate equivalent to present day Boston across the Charles river from Stephen Pinker’s office – which seems unlikely. If that were correct then the question we would have to ask is why our present day cities are more dangerous than their equivalents in an age of comparative lawlessness** ?\n\nhttp://bedejournal.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/steven-pinkers-medieval-murder-rates.html\n\nIs there anything more out there?",

Of course, any historian worth their salt would recognize that while this event may have had some impact on Stalin's psychology, the determining factors in the fate of 20th century Russia were economic, cultural, political, and historical characteristics, so numerous and vast and shaped by millions of participants as well as Stalin.\n\nOh wait, I'm fucking dumb, THIS is what caused the Soviet Union to be such a fucked up place. Only this.\n\n&gt;And then he set out to make absolutely sure that the entire world knew he fucking meant it. \n\nYes. Nevermind that Stalin was already involved in the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party at this point. Nevermind that two years earlier he was already submitting articles to the party newspaper. Nope, Stalin's wife died, and he chose the already active Social-Democrats as his personal vehicle to wreak havoc on the world.\n\n&gt;Think about this a second. Every evil, cruel, and inhumane act, was an affirmation of his love for her. His whole fall from humanity and his corruption into darkness was his way of saying, \"I love you\" to his dead wife.\n\nIndeed, indeed. There were absolutely no other factors at play in early 20th century Russia. No impersonal economic or political forces that may have had a hand in shaping the Stalin years. No other prominent individuals like Lazar Kaganovich or Leon Trotsky had any influence on Soviet policy. All of Russia was so much putty in his love-sickened hands.\n\n&gt;People tend to over analyse Stalin's personal life in an attempt to understand the terror in the Soviet Union. The truth, however, is more complicated than that.\n\nOh hey, I guess it's not all bad. This gentleman here seems to have some basic understanding of how human society progresses through history. But he only has nineteen upvotes, whereas this fellow replied...\n\n&gt;davt, born presumably in 1990, probably just wanted to sound smart.\n\nWow. This is actually the one comment that inspired me to make this thread. Apparently, attributing gargantuan shifts in human history to one person's private tragedy is the right way to do things, and any attempt to look deeper, you know, like most historians tend to do, is just arrogance.\n\n&gt;It which point they probably should've found themselves a new leader.\n\nYou mean another leader aside from Tsar Nicholas II? Because that's who the leader of Russia was at the time. Not Stalin.\n\nEven though the reddit majority are all hyper-intelligent STEM majors, it seems that they all decided to stay home during their history courses.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am in no way trying to apologize for the actions of Stalin or the Soviet regime. I'm simply poking fun at the attempt to pathologize complex historical events. Whatever you may think of Stalin or communism, he was already a dyed-in-the-wool Marxist by 1905. Furthermore, he wouldn't become leader of the Soviet Union until 1921, almost twenty years after his wife's death.\n\nAlso, it's funny to note that Stalin is said to have mocked a Christian friend of his at seminary school, and told him to go read Darwin's Origin of the Species instead of the Bible. I wonder if he would have browsed r/atheism if he was alive today.",

The text reads:\n\n&gt; During WW2 it was predicted that Nazi Germany would invade Britain and Churchill would be killed.\n\n&gt; Future Labour Party leader Michael Foot was tasked with assassinating Nazi-appeaser Lord Halifax should he become Hitler's puppet ruler over the United Kingdom.\n\nI don't claim any particular knowledge of WWII, but this struck me as a somewhat extraordinary claim to make without citing any sources. I tracked down the original post to facebook, where the photo was captioned:\n\n&gt; So the other day I made a post about how ex-Labour leader Michael Foot was trained as an assassin during WW2.\n\n&gt; Now I know you lot want more than a simple article so I knocked up this photoshop photo of him popping a cap in E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax's ass for collaborating with the Nazis, enjoy!\n\nWell, actually, I would like an article. Much more than a stupid meme picture with no sources, at least. So I scrolled back through the timeline in search of the post referred to. Imagine my delight when I found it to be thoroughly researched and immaculately footnoted.\n\nWait, that isn't what I found. Instead:\n\n&gt; So according to QI - Quite Interesting, ex-Labour leader Michael Foot was trained by the military so that he would be able to fight against Nazi collaborators if Britain was invaded during WW2 and was tasked with taking out Nazi sympathiser/collaborator Lord Halifax should he rise to power.\n\n&gt; This guy just got a heck of a lot cooler.\n\nAh, QI. Well, now I totally believe this claim. /s\n\nExcept, as it turns out, even QI weren't making this claim. According to the summary of Series G episode 3 [found here](http://www.thefullwiki.org/QI_(G_series\\)) (where, I think, this claim must have come from), in a discussion of the Home Guard:\n\n&gt;  Their job was to kill the Germans and also make sure that Winston Churchill wasn't removed, as it was believed that someone like Lord Halifax was going to take over. Amongst the \"Scallywags\" were Michael Foot, George Orwell, J. B. Priestley. They were trained to kill anyone who was in collaboration with the Nazis. Foot at one point said that he'd have killed Lord Halifax. \n\nSo in fact, the claim is that Foot at one point said that if Halifax had agreed to the unconditional surrender of Britain to the Nazis, he would have killed him. This, at least, is true. In an interview on Radio 4 ([on this programme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/document/document_20050905.shtml)), Foot told the interviewer that ['I'd have killed him'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-y82p0FR4Q&amp;feature=player_embedded) (audio clip on youtube)\n\nThis is a far cry from the original claim, that Foot was specially trained to kill political targets in case of Nazi occupation of Germany. Instead, he was a member of the Home Guard (along with 1.5m others, according to wikipedia), who in an interview more than sixty years later said that in an alternate history which never happened, he would have been prepared to kill Lord Halifax.\n\nAny other WWII bad history in either the QI episode or the original post I leave as an exercise to the reader.",

Prior to that no one gave a shit - and even now, apart from you no one gives a shit - with good reason! You were pretty much nobodies back then. Also, seeing as your empire his risen so fast (since 1945) and may collapse equally quickly, historically you might just be seen as the extended aftermath of the British empire.\n\nAs you can see, this guy claims that American history didn't matter and no one cared back then or now, saying that America only really started mattering in 1914. Let's see what happened in American history before 1914 shall we? Starting at the beginning in the 1700s we have the obvious start with the American Revolution disrupting British power in the New World, the new power structure means that Britain has a much weaker foot hold in the new world and no longer controls the highly lucrative tobacco trade, inspired by the American Revolution the French people revolt under the same principles of the Enlightenment, which completely alters the European political landscape and marks the decline in powerful monarchies and the decline of the church's power in European politics, moving into the 1800s we have the Louisiana Purchase, the money from said sale eventually helping to fund Napoleon's military machine and conquest of Europe, shortly after we have the invention of the Steamboat,  moving forward a few years and skipping a bit of stuff we have the invention of the profile lathe and milling machine which revolutionize precision crafting and make the mass manufacture of precision instruments a reality. Along with the ability to create interchangeable parts. Moving forwards another 15 years we come to Samuel Morse and his version of the electrical telegraph and his eponymous code which revolutionizes the way people communicate. Moving inexorably forward through time and again skipping things because they're either not fun to write about or I'm too lazy write about them, we have the invention of the telephone in 1876, continuing onward we have Edison inventing the lightbulb, in 1898 the Spanish American War results in the collapse of the Spanish Empire and Spain steps down from being a world power, moving into the 1900s now and we have the founding of the Ford motor company and the proliferation of automobiles because of it, the first powered flight, the birth of modern cinema, and honestly more things than I have time to list. The assertion that before 1914 America was nothing is likely one of the most ignorant statements and most egregious examples of bad history I've seen on Reddit.\n\nFor more on American history and why this guy's a dumbass, also all of the stuff I skipped because I'm lazy, see these handy dandy Wikipedia pages.

        "text": "Since moving to the UK, I've discovered that I have a deep love of pies, pasties, and everything in between. They're not something you have in the states - at least not in the glorious incarnations you find here - and there's such a massive variety of them that they're hard not to love. My favourite ones, though, come from a place in Edinburgh called Piemaker. They do a wide variety of vegan ones, which always makes me super-duper happy. Anyway, I noticed today that they have a [history of pies](http://i.imgur.com/sHWMZjg.jpg) on their pie wrappers. My face fell as I saw it. For shame, Piemaker, spreading bad history about such a glorious foodstuff! For. Shame.\n\nI can't really comment on whether or not Piemaker works with \"manufacturers of repute\" or any of the last paragraph, but I *can* talk about the history of the pasty and the pie. I can say with great sorrow that Piemaker is not entirely correct in its history of pie.\n\nFor starters, while the Romans did make pies and [record their recipes and contents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicius), they were not the first to do so. The first evidence of pies comes from [Neolithic Egypt](http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory.htm), though there were pies all through the Near East with a variety of [fillings and sturctures](http://www.silkroadgourmet.com/mesopotamian-cookoff-three-mersu-recipes/). These early pies were galette-like and contained fruit and nuts baked in rather than dough wrapped around a filling. Called *dhourras,* these pies have been shown on the walls of the [tomb of Ramses II](http://www.everythingpies.com/image-files/rameses-iii-bakery-spiral-shaped-bread.jpg), giving evidence that pie was probably something he valued. \n\nThings that are more recognisably pie emerged in Ancient Greece. Ancient Greek pies consisted of dough wrapped around meat to help cook it as well as to help keep juices in. This allowed them to carry food more compactly while on the move. We also find evidence of Greek pies in references in Aristophanes to \"[sweetmeats](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9i86AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=aristophanes+sweetmeat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=usdOpYcBCq&amp;sig=Ww2Ve6i27qGp7xUVKR2uzSpRXcA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tp_nU4rxAai47AbUtoDYDQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).\" Granted, the word \"sweetmeat\" has a lot of different meanings based on culture and context, but one meaning does include pastry, and some translations reflect that.\n\nThis takes us back to Rome. The Romans absolutely had [pie](http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/cato_recipes.html). One of these included the *placenta,* a sort of early cheesecake. While pies were popular among the upper classes of Roman society, they were also often used as an offering to the gods in addition to being eaten (not the same individual pie. Some pie for gods, some for nobles). Once again, because of the portability and flexibility of pies, they were the ideal food for a travelling army, and thus spread throughout the Roman empire. Indeed, the word \"pasty\" has its origin in [Latin](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=337). These were not, however, made with maize, but rather with wheat flour and spelt. Maize would not be introduced to Europe until the 15th and 16th centuries, well after the decline of the Western Roman Empire. \n\nPies continued their popularity in medieval Europe, though known more often as \"coffyns\" rather than pies. The word \"pie\" itself may come from the 12th century, but more certainly can be found in the 14th century. Regardless, pies as a food were enjoyed across Europe. They were filled with a [variety](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Andalusian/andalusian6.htm#Heading257) of stuffings, but because of the ease with which they could be made (a baked thing that is its own dish? Hell yes!), they were most often stuffed with some sort of meat, depending on what was available. By the 14th century, pies were a source of entertainment as well as food. \"Pyes\" at nobles' events could contain live birds or other beasts. The *Epulario,* published in 1598 includes among its instructions \"[To make Pies that the Birds may be aliue in them, and flie out when it is cut vp](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A00309.0001.001?view=toc).\" Yum. \n\nObviously everyday people weren't being serenaded by trapped blackbirds every time they sat down for lunch. Pies for common people were simpler, continuing to be stuffed with meat and vegetables. The pie wrapper is correct in saying that pies for the masses became more and more common with industrialisation and mining in the 17th and 18th centuries. In Cornwall, the pie evolved from a dish filled with meat to a folded over doughy thing stuffed with warm meat. By the end of the 18th century, [it had become extremely popular among miners as a warm and filling food that could be eaten even with dirty hands and no cutlery](http://www.cornishpastyassociation.co.uk/cornish-pasty-historical-information/). The ease of eating it and the fillingness of it also made it more popular with the working class as industrialisation took hold in Britain. It is dreadfully important to note, though (seeing as it's a protected food and all), that the Cornish pasty most certainly arose in Cornwall and not Wales, as Piemaker claims. \n\nThe legacy of the pie as a working class food rose in the UK, and both the pie and the pasty remain hugely popular. However, it's always important to pay homage to one's food and to recognise the millennia of history that have gone into making my lunch.\n\nRecommended reading: Pie: A Global History, by Janet Clarkson\n\nA History of Food, by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat\n\nFood in History, by Reay Tannahill",

[Why are you so hard to find on Reddit, yet so mindbendingly dumb when you do rear one of your ugly heads?](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/96lc4/i_saw_a_bumper_sticker_today_that_said_when/c0bmlvw)\n\nNow, the post in question comes as a surprisingly well written refutation to a typical ratheist bumper sticker with the wording of, \"You know when religion ruled the world? They called it the Dark Ages\". /u/redreplicant does a good job of deflecting the typical criticisms leveled against the Catholic Church around the early middle ages, such as doing a decent job of identifying far more obvious causes of the societal collapse in Western Europe than the stupid Church running around and burning everything (hint: rhymes with arbarians) and actually gives credit to the Church for preserving much of what we know of Antiquity, which only serves to make me sad that to see r/Atheism has somehow managed to decline in voting pattern quality over the last 5 years. \n \n&gt;...As to the art, there is a pestilential modern tendency to say \"OH THESE PEOPLE COULDN'T DRAW LOL.\" This is patently untrue. There was a particular stylistic decision made at the end of the Roman Empire to begin a more schematic, less \"realistic\" type of depiction; it is not because people suddenly got stupid. We have examples of both styles in the same monument. Placing some kind of value judgment on art is always a bad idea; what constitutes beautiful to one person is terrible to another. Thus, Picasso makes some people really frustrated-- he could obviously draw, but he chose not to. Over time, the techniques of the Romans were lost to an extent (concrete making, etc) and as people tend to do the later artists built on what the former did. Over time the style AGAIN changed, the Italians leaned toward three-dimensionality, and there you go, the Renaissance.\n&gt;Most of the problems people have with understanding Medieval art arise from the fact that Art History is a relatively young field. Like, about 120 years old young. And when it started, a young guy by the name of Winkelmann was absolutely in LOVE with classical art, and his writings took off and suddenly everyone was in love with it to the exclusion of just about everything else. Medieval art was studied, but in a more dry, cataloging type of way, and it didn't help that it was largely done by Germans who were doing it because it was \"German\" art and ended up politicizing it. A lot of Medieval art was used as NAZI propaganda, and it gave the rest of the world a bad taste. Art historians veered away from it and taught an entire couple of generations that illusionism is somehow \"better\" than otherwise, without any real basis for that declaration. And because it is more challenging to actually understand non-illusionistic art, a whole lot of lazy people were perfectly fine believing that Michelangelo was tops and everything non-realistic was chaff.\n\nD:\n...I ain't lazy. I just really like Michelangelo. \n\nUnfortunately, the one known as /u/bludo leaps in:\n&gt;I would say that there's an awful lot of misinformation in your post regarding the art between the antiquity and the renaissance....\n&gt;**The revolution that happened in art during the renaissance was closely related to the fall of the church and the medieval practices.** Because the restrictions began to loosen, the advancements in medicine, physics and chemistry helped art a great deal. Artists started doing dissections on cadavers, studying physics and optics, better paints were developed. From this you can see a gradual evolution towards realism in anatomy, perspective, shading, aesthetics and composition. It's not like one day they decided to switch style, this happened in hundreds of years. **If you want to see what art would look today if the church maintained control , look at the christian orthodox paintings.**\n\nOh for flyin' flippin' fluppin' --- fl -- shit.\n\nWhere the Florida do these people come up with these ideas? Seriously? \"The revolution that happened in art during the Renaissance was closely related to the fall of the Church and medieval practices\"? How do these people people wake up in the morning and function in the day without associating rain from the sky to their toaster oven?\n\n&gt;Artists started doing dissections on cadavers\n\nYo, given that even dirty medieval peasants tended towards two functioning eyeballs and can capture the image of a human body's form at just about photo-realism, I think we can safely dis-attribute the trend towards realism in art during the Renaissance from a few guys slicing dead motherfuckers open on a table.\nBesides, we only really know of a few famous artists who actually did this, two really famous ones in particular, Leonardo Da Vinci whom I guarantee was simply trying to stave off his suspected crushing boredom with life and mortals in general, and Michelangelo is another, who I think have mentioned before as so focused on his craft of art to near psychosis. The man would probably have cut off his own feet if it would make him a better sculptor by that much.^1 Attributing realism in art to dissections because a handful of artists attended such curio is like attributing the Lunar Landing to the movie \"Night of the Body Snatchers\" because both Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to go see it.\n\n&gt;studying physics and optics\n\n....yes, it is acceptable to attribute the development of Linear Perspective in art to advances in optics and physics. ^but ^the ^Church ^had ^nothing ^to ^do ^with ^suppressing ^optics ^and ^physics ^grumble ^rabble ^grumble \n\n&gt;better paints were developed\n\nOIL PAINTING MASTERRACE! ALL HEIL THE OIL-PAINT-USING MASTER RACE! A SUPERIOR BREED OF PAINT! THE UBERMENCH OF PAINTS Fuck that eggy tempera shit.\n\n To be fair, the development of oil painting did have a large influence on paint at the time-- the effect of which led to richer, deeper colors, the ability to layer multiple glazes from within, and a harder, more enamel-like finish.\n\nNone of which, by the way, have anything to fucking do with Medieval people's ability to paint realistic people. The Middle Ages weren't filled with artworks that just so desperately needed that one guy to look that much more of a deeper pink tinge to be realistic. Medieval artists weren't weeping over their shitty, lighter toned matte-y tempera paints, and they weren't walking into walls because they had no concept of depth perspective. Until we discover that these European monk-artists from the tenth and eleventh centuries were actually painting with sticks with the leaves still on them, grey mud mixed with feces, and the blood from a human sacrifice to Baal, real art historians will continue to accept the particular style choices of the era as just that-- style choices, and not as a result of technical, intelligence or religiously based limitations as is continuously imagined by the denizens of r/Atheism as part of a historically universal narrative of all historical peasants being nothing but dumb OedipusComplex-fuckers and child molesters;  religion being at the root heart of all that is somehow both cunningly evil yet breathtakingly stupid, like some mentally handicapped Satan sitting trapped at a bottom of a swirling whirlpool hell of human ignorance and stupidity.\n\nAlso, to attack the original stupid source-- professor, how exactly was the Church suppressing  and restricting better oil-based paints? Does it contradict John, 19:98-- \"Thou shalt not toil with dyes not mixed from the broken halves of an unblooded chicken's egg\"? Were Catholic priests nervously wringing their hands at the sight of these deeper, more vibrant colors in the paintings hanging on their walls, even while the clergy were throwing out sponsorship at artists like it was going out of style? Or do you maybe think that the Catholic Church just hates all things good, beautiful and progressive in life? \n\nTIL that the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages were literally [Reapers](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100107173525/masseffect/images/f/f0/Reaper.jpg) \n\n&gt;The revolution that happened in art during the renaissance was closely related to the fall of the church and the medieval practices... If you want to see what art would look today if the church maintained control , look at the christian orthodox paintings.\n\n...\nIf I kill myself now, the terrorists win... \n...\n...if I kill myself now... the terrorists... win...\n... \nOk, do y'all wanna hear an explanation as to why the Renaissance flourished in Europe, and more specifically, City-State Italy, as not elaborated by a mouth-breather? It goes like this:\nOne day, Pope Urban the Eighty Billionth was growing increasingly concerned of Muslim incursions on the Byzantine Empire, and he also simultaneously wanted to put as many miles between him and all these fucking knights who were rampaging each other to death all throughout Europe. So in a bid to consolidate power underneath the papacy, to get rid of the roach-knights, and to assist the Eastern Orthodoxies in the East, he called a crusade and shipped everyone off to the other side of the planet. And then he cackled, rest his feet on the willing back of his servant Lord Vader, and quaffed a full goblet of atheist baby blood; I don't know, I'm kind of fuzzy on the details. Not a real Middle Ages expert here.^2\n\nAnyhow, the result of a few centuries worth of war in the East was a huge influx of wealth for the numerous city-states of the Italy area, cities like Florence, Naples, Venice, etc. This resulted in a unique state of power, where if you were so inclined to believe so, you could point to this as the Church \"falling\" from power. That is, if you are the type of person (read:idiot) to believe that the sun rises in the morning because it is being dragged out on the tail end of the setting moon. You see, it wasn't the fall of the Church, never mind that such a thing never happened, that truly caused a rebirth of art and culture-- it was money.^3 During the Renaissance, money and art went hand in hand. Artists depended totally on patrons while the patrons needed money to sustain these primadonna geniuses. What we see in these now extremely wealthy city-states is the advent of capitalism and mercantilism, where it is not absolute monarchs who rule through divine right, but money that does so. Merchants who benefited from increased trade flows from the East suddenly found themselves in the utmost elite of society, along with the clergy whom I may note was still extremely powerful, being associated with the Papal States which was quite literally in the geographical center of all of this influx of wealth, along with religion still playing a huge role in nearly everyone in Europe's lives at the time, which means you would have to have several consecutive aneurysms to believe that the Church in any way \"fell from power\".^4 If anything, they grew even more affluent and powerful as a result of the rise of mercantilism, but their power was just more of the same being boosted up by the powerful economies of the Italian city-states at the time.\nAnyhow, the result of all of this money was, as I said, the birth of the artist, and more specifically, the artist as a celebrity, like the types of Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian and more, who were pretty much rock stars of the Renaissance.^5 The creation of the professional artist and by proxy the standardization of art (quality wise) through the [guild system](http://arthistoryresources.net/renaissance-art-theory-2012/renaissance-artist.html), along with the quite literal invention of celebrities who were recognized not for their bloodline or office, but their awe-inspiring talents, led to an unprecedented explosion of culture and refinement. \nTHAT is the reason (or a more defensible reason, I suppose) as to why we have the Renaissance, children. Wealth and the birth of mercantilism and meritocracy within a uniquely anti-monarchical and well-connected collection of city-states, not because fucking Pope Sidious forgot to turn up the science-suppress dial to 11 on the STEM sciences.\nAs for this: \n\n&gt;If you want to see what art would look today if the church maintained control , look at the christian orthodox paintings.\n\n/u/redreplicant sums it up pretty well here:\n&gt;You're ~~not exactly correct~~ /Yulong edit: totally fucking wrong, holy shitballs/ about the orthodox paintings. Byzantine art is an animal all unto itself and has looked about the same for thousands of years, intentionally. In fact, Byzantines were doing exactly the same type of icons while many different styles were developing in medieval Europe-- Romanesque, Gothic, you name it. It doesn't really have to do with the Church maintaining control, because the church had about the same control in Western Europe as it did in Byzantium; just two different styles of artistic development.\n\n\nBONUS:\n&gt;The nazis had a thing for the old German rulers that had their castles filled with romantic art. I my opinion neo-romanticism is a bit meh.\n\nAs a reminder kids, in Art History, no one gives a fuck about your opinion on art. For example, on occasion I think Rococo art is shallow and pornographic and a symptom of the corrupt and detached attitudes of the French bourgeois that would get their empty heads guillotined a few years later in the French Revolution but then I remind myself that I'm in Art History and that no one gives a fuck what I think, The End.\n\nBONUS BONUS: Especially if all you have to say about an entire era of art is \"meh\". Like holy shit, what a waste of breath that could be used to fuel your CO2 pickled brain.

        "text": "I came across a thread in /r/history discussing the Khmer Rouge, in this thread the talk turned to Noam Chomsky and his role in denying and downplaying the Cambodian genocide; a poster reasonably asked: how does this guy manage to maintain his reputation? (I'm going to assume this affair is well enough documented that I don't need to dwell on it, it is not relevant to my following argument)\n\nLet me get this straight - I'm not of the opinion that someone can not do useful work outside of their field of expertise - many non-historians write history extremely well, according to it's best practice and method, and often with much more incision and talent of prose than many within the field. But I feel very confident in saying Noam Chomsky is no such individual.\n\nSo I embarked on a small enterprise in order to shut people up about Chomsky and the fabricated horseshit he attempts to pass off as real history, or, 'unacceptable truths' - which is his euphimistic alternative premise for \"academic historians broadly consider me a fraud and a *Pilgerist*\". Naturally these critics are mostly perceived sufferers of Marx's False Consciousness... shit, I mean Chomsky's \"Manufacturing of Consent\".\n\nMy methodology was simple - working under the assumption that one could select any random Chomsky essay, study it, and detect a brazen act of intellectual dishonesty, I went to the website of *The Nation* and searched for Chomsky, selecting the first thing I saw: [It Is a Wonder We Are Still Alive](http://www.thenation.com/article/180889/it-wonder-we-are-still-alive)\n\nWritten on the fifth of this month, subtitled:\n\n&gt; Sixty-nine years ago today, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, beginning a countdown toward the inglorious end of our species.\n\nPerfect! Very much the kind of apocalyptic senility I've come to expect from Chomsky. *The end of the world is nigh - America did it*. Far be it from me to be flip about the threat of mutually assured destruction, which Chomsky righteously bemoans in the opening of his essay - the query he poses after is a perfectly reasonable one, but immediately answered with typical Chomsky elusiveness and rhetorical gymnastics:\n\n&gt; Could that threat have been taken off the table? We cannot, of course, be sure, but it was hardly inconceivable.\n\n*Of course* Noam, we *cannot be sure* can we? \"Hardly inconceivable\" is basically a completely empty statement and logically equivalent to another Chomsky staple: *it's not impossible* (you will, on close reading, find these types of flaccid and pointlessly misleading premises littered throughout his writing)... sure Noam, you keep peddling that old bull to cover your lying ass, we'll keep on being insulted that you seem to think us belligerent bourgeois reactionaries have never heard of inductive reasoning or *inference as to the best explanation*. \n\nSo, now we have established that it's 'hardly inconceivable' that the terrifying nuclear brinksmanship of the cold war could potentially have been avoided, it's time to elaborate on exactly *how* such a de-escalation of the conflict could have been achieved. Exhibit A:\n\n&gt; One indication of possible opportunities to blunt the threat was a remarkable proposal by Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin in 1952, offering to allow Germany to be unified with free elections on the condition that it would not then join a hostile military alliance.\n\nIndeed, the so-called 'Stalin note' (please Google, I wont waste any time with extraneous detail), Chomsky summarizes:\n\n&gt; Stalin’s proposal was taken seriously by the respected political commentator James Warburg, but otherwise mostly ignored or ridiculed at the time. Recent scholarship has begun to take a different view. The bitterly anti-Communist Soviet scholar Adam Ulam has taken the status of Stalin’s proposal to be an “unresolved mystery.” Washington “wasted little effort in flatly rejecting Moscow’s initiative,” he has written, on grounds that “were embarrassingly unconvincing.” The political, scholarly and general intellectual failure left open “the basic question,” Ulam added: “Was Stalin genuinely ready to sacrifice the newly created German Democratic Republic (GDR) on the altar of real democracy,” with consequences for world peace and for American security that could have been enormous?\n\nOn the face of it, this is not a very convincing start to his argument - \"a historian shrugged\", but when one inserts the *hidden premise*, the service of this passage toward Chomsky's argument is reasonably clear: remember when he introduced this particularly unhelpful source as \"The bitterly anti-Communist Soviet scholar\"? Here we are meant to assume, \"well, if bitterly anti-Soviet scholar Adam Ulam can't find any evidence of Stalinist perfidy or insincerity, that evidence probably doesn't exist\", then a seed of doubt is planted: \"if the west still doesn't know the truth of Stalin's intentions, then how could they have known back then, when they rejected the proposal\" and suddenly: \"if it's possible (*not inconceivable*, and thus Chomsky's argument almost magically becomes logically 'valid') that Stalin was sincere in his proposal to unite Germany, then it is possible that the cold war stand-off could have been avoided\".\n\nOf course, it is difficult to analyze a source when the author fails to cite it adequately - Adam Ulam has a publishing history over half a century long! Am I just gonna sift through them *all* in the library for the next few weeks just to bum-out Chomsky? Fuck no! I'm going to point out that Adam Ulam retired 20 over years ago and last published in '94 - a year, incidentally, that research into newly accessible Soviet archives was published in English by Gerhard Wettig which dispelled any of the 'mystery' surrounding 'the Stalin note' (Gerhard Wettig, \"Stalin and German Reunification: Archival Evidence on Soviet Foreign Policy in Spring 1952\", *The Historical Journal*, 37,  2). Wettig concludes a very robust argument:\n\n&gt; The Soviet documents make abundantly clear that the three Western governments to which the note was sent were not the real addressees. The initiative was meant to mobilize the German 'masses', particularly in the Federal Republic, behind communist cadres under Soviet control in an intense effort to oust Adenauer's government and to force the Western powers out of Germany. Thus the basic premise of Western judgement - that Stalin was confronted with the choice of having either to seek agreement with Western governments or to accept his action's irrelevance was absent from the Soviet foreign policy-makers' minds. The initiators of the March 1952 note rather felt that they could effect political change in Germany by instrumentalizing the note for the purpose of mobilizing the German population against the Western powers and the West German government.\n\nWettig comprehensively deploys internal memos (between Gormykov and Stalin) and early drafts of the note to demonstrate that at no point did those who framed it ever intended the West Germans or capitalist powers to accept it, and it was formulated as a tool of Soviet polemic on the eve of West German integration into European security arrangements:\n\n&gt; If the contingency of Western willingness to accept negotiations was taken into account at all, it was never seen to be likely. What is more, the Soviet foreign policy-makers at all levels never felt that such acceptance was desirable. A positive response by Western governments was never discussed as an objective to the attainment of which efforts had to be made. It was the general public, particularly in Germany, to whom the message was directed.\n\nI'm sure Noam will be very pleased to hear this 'mystery' has been solved, twenty fucken years ago! (I'm going to give him a freebie, and let slide the fact he has tenure at one the world's most prestigious academic institutions, and presumably therefore access to JSTOR, and Wikipedia, and professional historians to clear up all this confusion... we all make mistakes?) Yes, Stalin was the cynical cunt everybody assumed he was. Let's move on. Chomsky doesn't even pause to catch his breath before the next shocking expose:\n\n&gt; Reviewing recent research in Soviet archives, one of the most respected Cold War scholars, Melvyn Leffler, has observed that many scholars were surprised to discover “[Lavrenti] Beria—the sinister, brutal head of the [Russian] secret police—propos[ed] that the Kremlin offer the West a deal on the unification and neutralization of Germany,” agreeing “to sacrifice the East German communist regime to reduce East-West tensions” and improve internal political and economic conditions in Russia—opportunities that were squandered in favor of securing German participation in NATO.\n\nLeffler is indeed a highly respected historian of the cold war (note again Chomsky seems very concerned we are aware of his source's pedigree, moreso than putting their words in proper context), but note the operative term: \"has observed\" - it effectively means nothing. He doesn't care to explain *why* scholars were surprised, once again the reader is left to insert the hidden premises and draw his own conclusions - remember in just the last paragraph Chomsky left an open question for the reader: \"Was Stalin genuinely ready to sacrifice the newly created German Democratic Republic (GDR) on the altar of real democracy?\", a query by Ulam in relation to the 'Stalin note' of March 1952 - I propose that Chomsky, while not *explicitly* drawing a connection between his two premises, deliberately arranged them so that the reader would conclude that evidence of Beria's apparently sincere attempts at liberal reform relate directly to the question of whether the unification proposal of the previous year was indeed sincerely felt by the USSR's leadership.\n\nDid I say 'previous' year? Why, yes I did, and now I get to the point: the remarkable political turnaround by Beria of which Leffler speaks didn't take place until *after* Stalin had died (hidden premise: Stalin did not manage to initiate the 'Stalin note' from beyond the grave), and furthermore, when we include just a teency-weency little bit more of Leffler's statement like so:\n\n&gt; To the surprise of many scholars, the documents show Beria -- the sinister, brutal head of the secret police -- proposing that the Kremlin offer the West a deal on the unification and neutralization of Germany. Beria was willing to sacrifice the East German communist regime to reduce East-West tensions, help ensure an orderly transition in the Kremlin, and allow for some reallocation of resources to improve the Soviet economy. **But the other three contenders, fearing the secret police chief and a reunited Germany seeking to recover territory and influence lost in World War II, arranged for Beria’s arrest and execution**.\n\nhttp://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/52247/melvyn-p-leffler/inside-enemy-archives-the-cold-war-reopened\n\nThe brazen mendacity of Chomsky is revealed. How the fuck did you manage to omit that little snippet of info where the guy (as malignant and vicious a human being as he was) who spearheaded liberal reforms after Stalin's death was denounced and put to death by his comrades because of it? And this is what you call \"opportunities that were squandered in favor of securing German participation in NATO\"? \n\nThere are little differences between the quoted passage and the original, which are totally unnecessary - Beria is no longer 'proposing'  but has 'proposed', from \"Beria was willing to sacrifice\" to \"agreeing to sacrifice\" - they subtly change the assembled meaning of Leffler's carefully chosen words. The insertion of \"agreeing\" is particularly undue, as it conveys an impression that he was not just \"willing\" to concede to the demands of the west, but had already \"agreed\" to them, maybe I'm alone in thinking the distinction is important? Make up your own minds at home.\n\n(edit) I really am tired, I only just noticed that Chomsky had completely erased Leffler's reference to \"orderly transition in the Kremlin\" - more fuel to the fire!\n\nI'm a cynic I admit, but I don't expect Chomsky to explain that sleight-of-hand, I do genuinely wonder what he would say to the elegant conclusion to Leffler's essay:\n\n&gt; Turning the Cold War into a morality play encourages the ducking of moral dilemmas present and future. What happens when virtue and self-interest do not go hand in hand?\n\nHmm, well I can guess - if you're an enemy of the US: \"forgive and forget\"; if you're the US or an ally of the US: \"you have wrought upon us an Armageddon\". There were a number of other serious issues in Chomsky's article I wanted to address, but following this debacle I'm really tired, and after uncovering the intellectual dishonesty I was looking for (and not looking at all very hard, literally within the first few paragraphs I read), it seems redundant.\n\n",
