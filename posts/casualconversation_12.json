He carried hia store through the pandemic and trained 4 or 5 managers that were above him in the company just for them all to quit or be fired, and they never promoted him. He interviewed at a different restaurant and told the previous employer that he got an offer somewhere else and what they would offer to keep him. Made it clear there had to be an action plan to promotion in order to stay. The strung him along for about 4 months with no plans and then started to make questionable health risks with the food and he said that was the last straw. He interviewed at a few places and landed on a new avenue of the food industry and switched in November. He was with the company 3 months and 1 day and has been officially promoted to the store manager!  \n\nI am so proud of him and excited for the future. It's really good pay and would really help our family get out of a bind until I can get my career off the ground. I'm such a big ball of excitement, and he asked me not to share with any because he wanted to share his news, so I came to reddit because I couldn't not share with someone. He is so deserving of this and I am overjoyed it finally happened! \n\nThanks for reading!",

I just felt like talking a bit about why I love music so much and what I love about it, and I‚Äôd love to hear what other people enjoy most about it. \n\nFor me, I listen to music almost constantly. I refuse to have silence, especially when I can have something so amazing to listen to. I even listen to music to sleep. \n\nThere are so many amazing things about music to me. There‚Äôs the emotions it makes me feel, the way it sounds, etc.\n\nI have so many playlists of songs for when I‚Äôm in different moods. For example, I have a playlist for when I feel energetic, and a playlist for when I‚Äôm sad, and many more for so many emotions and moods. Having your music match what your feeling is ideal in my opinion; I can‚Äôt imagine listening to an energetic song while I‚Äôm sad, it would just be weird. \n\nI grew up with a dad who would sing to me a lot and played the guitar, and I don‚Äôt doubt that my love for music stems from him. He loves music, and while we don‚Äôt really listen to the same genres, we can still agree when music is good, despite not having the same taste. \n\nI love music in many genres, like pop, alternative, indie music, and a few more, and I listen to it in all different languages. The languages mostly include English, French, and Korean, but I also know some songs in Russian, Indonesian, and a few more languages. \n\nMost people will judge you when they find out you listen to music in languages you don‚Äôt understand, but is clear they just don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ feel the emotion as easily. For example, I‚Äôll usually look up lyrics for songs in other languages so I can truly understand, but even before doing that, you can sometimes feel the emotions they‚Äôre trying to portray simply by listening to it. I wish people could understand that more easily and not judge me, but I also stopped caring, because as long as I‚Äôm happy and able to feel good while listening to music, that‚Äôs all that matters.",

Though they are not at the CxO level, they are still senior enough to get paid a considerable amount. Unfortunately, this chat thread turned ugly as some of the guys began making derogatory comments about pronouns. One comment that stood out was, \"Who gives a f***, you just have to be seen doing the 'right' things these days.\" Others even joked about picking the \"correct\" pronouns to get a promotion or bonus. One person appeared to be anxious about getting the right pronouns not to offend anyone. Needless to say, the conversation was abhorrent on so many levels, and it left my wife's friend feeling deeply uncomfortable.\n\nMy wife's friend has been at the company for seven years and lives to work. The company is quite large and public, with a CEO who is a public figure in some circles. The question arises: does the company care about creating a safe and inclusive work environment, or is this a mere case of virtue signaling?\n\nWe are curious to hear what people think. Though it may be a taboo subject, has anyone else experienced a similar situation in their workplace? Is it common practice to make derogatory remarks about pronouns, or is this an isolated incident? Additionally, should my wife's friend report the incident and risk being unpopular, or should she keep quiet and avoid stirring the pot? We suggested that she could even sell the story, especially in light of Matt Hancock's recent WhatsApp leaks, but we also acknowledge that it could be damaging to the company if it got out.",

The thing is that since i first came to know about cheating in a relationship, i really got scared of such thing happening to me. It made me overthink a lot.\n\nRecently on reddit, i encountered subs related to infidelity and went through some post. I couldn't believe what was happening. So much of cheating in relationships. It made feel so sad and hopeless that i will never get a true loving, loyal and caring partner.\n\nAmong those posts I'll talk about the ones in which women cheated because that's what messing up my mind more. By no means i mean that men cheating doesn't affect me. It makes me feel disgusted on the same level as women cheating.\n\nSo in some situations cheating happened even if both the partners were together for a very long time. Like 20 - 30 years of marriage. This made me sad cuz i used to think the more the people live together the more closer they are and their bond in strong but here total opposite was happening. These women cheating either with a random person they met online, during travel for work or some friend they met after a long time at a reunion.\n\n1. Tbh i am now insecure. If in future, a situation in which my partner is traveling for work or doing a night out will get me worried that what if they cheat on me. How will i be able to trust ?\n\n2. I now think that even though if I'm married or in a relationship for so long won't matter at all. How much i care, love, respect and my efforts won't be of any worth.\nA man will come and destroy my relationship just like that. \n\n3. We all know that fights, quarrels and monotony happens in relationships. Not everything is perfect. It's a problem when it happens a lot or very frequently. But what if during one of those rare rough times, you get cheated on ?\n\nYes I'm overthinking and i know it. But i still can't escape from it. I saw all this happening to men on that sub. One thing i can do is I'll never visit those subs again in life unless something bad happens to me and i require some support.\n\nThat's all. Thanks for reading till here.",

But I also feel cowardly and like that‚Äôs what my abuser would like",

Over the past year I've been working with so many talented people on producing a audio drama version of my book, and in the process realized that I'd produce vanilla versions narrated solely by one person as well as it is easier to do.  I published one version recently.  But forgot to tell people about it.  And when I got up this morning, I sent out a broadcast to my friends.  And sure enough dozens of congratulations!  Feels so much better.  When you work hard and do something, it feels good.  Important note, don't forget to tell people later!  Have you done something for a long time that made you feel good, but you were resting afterward that you forgot to tell people about it?",

I'm a homebody, so I mostly enjoy indoor activities and am not the most outgoing guy, but I'm working on improving.\n\nI can be ambitious at times and know what I want to achieve and do my best to work towards a greater goal. I'm also quite passionate and can be a chatterbox in the digital world, but this can be looked at as a more exaggerated version of me than say, the real world, where I'm more timid and shy (I still don't understand the reason or explanation for this occurrence).\n\nSome of my hobbies include watching YouTube, listening to Spotify, browsing Reddit, looking at memes, taking walks, and meeting new people. As for communication preferences, I favor voice/video communication over text messages; however, this doesn't need to be a requirement for you and if you prefer the former, that's fine with me.\n\nI'm always open to making new friends and getting to meet like-minded people on a deeper level, so let's kick it off and see where it goes. If you think we could click and get along well, or you'd like to know me better as an individual, you may send me a message, and I'll get back to you promptly.",

I've spent the past few days pulling my hair out getting everything perfect while keeping the code nice and neat. For context, slopes can be difficult to program and it's been a year since I've programmed anything so I'm a bit rusty.\n\nThere was this one bug/error I kept getting that I had no idea how to fix. I've been trying to fix it since yesterday, and I was starting to get pissed off. So, naturally, I took that as a sign that I needed a break.\n\nI took a shower hoping that would help fix the issue. And within minutes of being in the shower, my brain went into overdrive and I found the solution to my problem.\n\nSo I got out of the shower, dried off, put my solution to the test, and lo and behold, it worked! Fixed the bug/error completely. Best feeling ever.\n\nSo yeah. Anyone else have an \"a-ha\" moment in the shower before?",

Been saying for over two years), people I talk to normally( a cashier at store about his girlfriend telling him she truly loves him), or just comments that happen that come true. \n\nYes with time there's some variation or lack of happening but that's how space time works. More time or space more apt for decisions or actions to prevent said thing. Also the USA government has looked into this aspect with the \"Stargate Program\" with mixed results... Look it up as some is declassified. 1991-1998 project if remember right or what they claim.\n\nWhen speaking to people or even just laying in bed I see/hear/etc what I am meaning.

A true blackout of power grid in Germany due to same solar flare, etc etc... My point being I don't know exact when, but I feel it as well as see my own power go out(rare as on main line).\n\nI am not saying this to brag or likewise but truly as a conversation starter of what abilities or gifts are out there that most don't talk about.",

The sound of gunfire and explosions fills my ears, and I feel like I'm in the middle of a warzone. The tension is palpable, and every decision I make feels like a life-or-death choice.\n\nThe objectives in Dustbowl are so challenging that they require me to use every ounce of my skill and cunning. The teamwork required to succeed is unparalleled, and I feel like I'm part of something much bigger than myself.\n\nIn short, playing Dustbowl in TF2 is like a spiritual experience for me. It's an adrenaline-fueled journey into the unknown, where every moment is filled with excitement and wonder. If you haven't played this map yet, I highly recommend it.

But the weird thing is, i only remember my childhood from before i turned 10 which is also the time my parents divorced. My family fell apart then and we lived separately ever since.\n\nIt makes me cry to this day and i feel like i have some serious suppressed sadness,anger and longing for the days i felt safe and happy. It almost feels as if i simply cannot experience stability and comfort the way i did when i was 1-9 yo. I remember memories so clearly. I remember how the house looks, how my parents look, how the carpet felt, where the big tv was... Everything to the smallest detail. I honestly cant remember what happened yesterday, but somehow these 20yo memories are as clear as day. Sometimes I wish i could revisit that place, i think it would bring me calmness but my childhood home has been completely redecorated, so i cant even do that.\n\nBecause of the divorce i feel like that comfort has been ripped away from me so early and now i cant forgive the circumstances that caused it. Every time i get high that is where i go. That is my happy and safe place. I can definitely say the longing is hunge and the nostalgia is intense. I'm so happy i have those memories, but i wish i could bring closure to my inner child who doesn't understand why it had to end so soon.\n\nIs anyone in a similar situation?",

This lady tells me that the upstairs haven't been cleaned yet and I unfortunately can't sit there at this moment. I was like \"Oh OKAY, then pack it up so I can take it with me please.\"\n\nThis lady was APALLED. I'm not joking, she genuinely   looked surprised and then smiled afterwards. Then told me that their patrons are  usually way more rude about the upstairs being unavailable they would insist on sitting there. I replied saying that it wasn't her fault and there was nothing she could do, especially this early in the morning. She smiled and thanked me for being kind told me that I made her morning and gave me a free cookie :))\n\nEver since that happened, she recognizes me every time I go there and does her  best to take my order and give me fresh stuff, making sure that I get what I want etc. And it honestly makes me smile so much every time. Be kind to the people around you and it just makes everyone's life's better.",
