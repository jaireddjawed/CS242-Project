I finished a lot of work, they promoted me early because I was doing well, and things felt great. \n\nBut last week I messed something up. I am not very experienced with git and accidentally messed up some repos. It was a bad fuck up on my part, and I was extremely apologetic and really tried to rectify the mistake. \n\nBut my team lead, who has always been really kind and a great mentor to me, has completely flipped and has been a dick to me since this incident. He berated me in a scrum meeting in front of our team, ignored my IM apologizing and has been nit picking everything I've done since then. \n\nI'm so confused by this. I know I fucked up, and I really do feel remorseful. But I have always gotten great feedback on my work since joining this job, and don't think my mess up was bad enough to warrant this much hostility. I've fucked up at my old job before and got some shit for it, but ultimately my teammates were supportive. I feel like if I was mediocre but skating by I wouldn't have been promoted out of cycle and given praise by everyone including my team lead... Why is this happening? Do I need to start looking for another job?",

Some details:\n\n* Ideally the finish would be a rubbery type of material/texture, similar to the mats and inlays in a car console\n\n* I need it to be thin, ideally less than 0.1mm if possible\n\n* Ideally it could look nice/clean if applied carefully, not some sort of goopy/uneven appearance\n\n* It doesn't need to be super durable, this is only for prototype use\n\n* I need to make around 100-200 parts with this so preferably repeatable and not too long of a process to apply. The area is circular, about the size of water bottle\n\n\nI appreciate any and all suggestions. Currently I'm thinking like some plastidip rubber spray with a spray stencil.",

        "text": "So in another thread:\n\n&gt;I found it kinda strange how the TCS works on my Toyota Avalon. It's a 2010 and the TCS (or VSC as Toyota calls it) works only if I lose grip. So if I floor it from a stop on a wet day, I'll spin the tires and it'll cut back power until it regains grip.\n&gt;\n&gt;And then some weird shit happens when I get a check engine light. My car got an exhaust leak sometime ago and occasionally it causes a check engine light for my catalyst system not working. Well, this catalyst code shuts off my VSC. So if I get a check engine, the car just gives it full power regardless of grip. I was driving in the snow once when the check engine came on and if I floored it, it would just redline through the snow flinging it everywhere.\n\nOkay, an emissions system failure cuts driver aids. If the engine reduces power via fuel-cut, I could see the risk of going lean and hurting parts. Maybe? \n\nBut I have no idea how systems work. Or is it some combination of fuel, timing, spark, or air if you have a throttle-by-wire car? I'm finding some drag-racing discussions. But that's not necessarily representative of an a consumer auto.\n\nNot my area of expertise I'm afraid. And thanks.",

Here are my options;\n\n-MD/MS BME dual degree: I was accepted to one such program. I think it would prepare me well, but it seems like a bad move to put so much effort and time towards med school/residency when treating people isn’t my aim. The upside is I’d have decent knowledge of the tech gaps in medicine. The downside is, I’d lose a lot of time I could be spending on what I really love. \n\n-Engineering Masters part time: this is the option I am leaning towards. I make enough money that I can afford to be a part time student, and the engineering is very strong at my company, so being able to potentially monkey branch into an engineering role once I have the skills would be invaluable. But I am not sure what degree to pursue. BME seems like the obvious choice at first, but unfortunately, at least in my company most BME majors aren’t doing design. Nothing wrong with that but it’s not my goal. The attitude seems to be to hire MechE/EE/SWE etc for those specific roles. And I already have a solid background in life sciences, so I’d rather focus on engineering coursework while BME includes things like physiology/genetic etc that I have already taken. So I am considering MechE/EE/ECE/CS/SWE even if I have to claw my way in and take lots of pre-reqs (and even then I’m not sure they’ll have me). \n\nWhat would you do in my situation? Also open to other suggestions that I did not list above, for degree options or other paths. \n\nThank you for your time!",

        "text": "For example, the prototype JTF17 engine by Pratt and Whitney for the SST program used a duct burning turbofan with a 1.3 : 1 bypass ratio for Mach 3 flight. In fact it was developed from the J58 turboramjet used on the SR-71.\n\nHere is a picture: [https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/data/attachments/152/152591-b3cb4be5b77be9a6ee11507ac92b5705.jpg](https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/data/attachments/152/152591-b3cb4be5b77be9a6ee11507ac92b5705.jpg)\n\nand\n\n[https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/data/attachments/88/88022-04ed18d17f54d30b196eb8354bd9e3be.jpg](https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/data/attachments/88/88022-04ed18d17f54d30b196eb8354bd9e3be.jpg)\n\nIt essentially looks like the mach 3.2 cruise capable J58 turboramjet, but with an extra 2 stage fan section.\n\nIt is said that turbofans are inefficent in supersonic flight compared to turbojets due to shock induced drag by the large fan. But all supersonic cruise aircraft have a normal shock inducing intake, followed by a diffuser section that slows down supersonic air into the subsonic regime before input into the gas turbine.\n\nSo it really should not matter if a turbojet or turbofan is used right? As they both take in high pressure subsonic flow even during mach 3 flight?  So no shock induced drag? \n\nSo to go even further, why not create a mach 3+ airliner with a hybrid turbofan-ramjet cycle? So in mach 3 cruise, like any ramjet, the intake diffuser section will slow down down supersonic air to subsonic flow for the turbofan and then into the afterburner. But during low speed flight, takeoff and landing, the high bypass turbofan provides a lot of power, efficiently, minus the afterburner.",

I worry that having no interships experience  puts me in a disadvantage since i feel that i lack skills for roles I want to do and see.

My thought process is since i did not do an internship  was to work on projects to gain these skills i see commonly for the roles I would like to do. \n\nOne of the issue that im facing is I would need to fund myself with these projects with the software and supplies. I dont know if this would be the best option to do or if there was an another way of gaining experience doing another route. I specifically would like a Mechanical Design Engineering role in the energy, areopsace , and manufacturing industry. \n\nAny advice would be helpful for the best course of action.

Neither him nor I are structural engineers but we’ve both worked on large projects that had structural elements. Once when I was doing a peer review of his site, he mentioned something about anchor bolts and I asked him to clarify what he meant. He repeated his statement that most, “something like 90%” of anchor bolts are just guides for setting steel or structural elements. So essentially those anchor bolts aren’t necessary for tying the structure to its foundations. This sounded WAY off from anything I’d ever heard or imagined but I couldn’t definitively say for sure, nor did I particularly care to engage in a structured argument between two non-engineers. I did a lot of reading about anchor bolts after that but could not really find anything saying yay or nay that I could fully understand as most of the time, the literature got very involved very quickly. \n\nSo, my question is just just that. Are the “majority” of anchor bolts just a guide on setting steel or structural components in the correct place? Or am I right that anchor bolts are a key structural element that ties the building to its foundations? \n\nLast note, I understand that engineering has some redundancy built in that could leave a gray area here as far as maybe some anchor bolts COULD be deleted and the building would be alright. That was not the heart of the statement. \n\nI can clarify better if there are any questions. r/",

I honestly have very little background knowledge of the industry the shows for and don’t want to waste peoples time or reflect poorly on my company. I plan on studying up on a bunch of the companies before hand. I will be mostly working our booth even though I have no sales, and little client side experience. I’m just wondering what your experiences have been at trade shows and if you have any good tips? Thanks!",

They can shit excellence into an idea. \n\nThey can come up with very creative designs, innovations, and engineered solutions that I would never think of; whether it is a unique solution to a specific problem, or the design of an entirely new system. I know that part of this just comes down to exposure and experience, but I can't help but feel like I wont be as good and creative as them even if I were to keep working under them for the next 20 years. I try to learn as much as I can from them, but they always seem to wow and impress me.\n\nIs there a way to grow and develop this skill? Can it be taught? For example, if I wanted to learn how to code, I could take an online class on Udemy or watch some YouTube videos; but creative product design... it feels like you either have the sauce or you don't.

So, I'm needed to simulate the proposed system. I have developed the algorithm needed for the system and is looking for a software to simulate it. The simulation part I'm trying to do is not too complex and as I'm a student, I can't really afford expensive software and is looking for some free trials or something like that. I tried to get trials for Vehicle Dynamics Block set for MATLAB and Carsim, but wasn't successful. So, I'm asking for help finding an alternative and further directions if possible as I'm inexperienced on the simulation side.\n\nAny help would be deeply appreciated.",

Then I would have an RF receiver on the arduino listen for the wake command from the Xbox controller and power on the PC.\n\nHow would I get the RF receiver to capture the wake command from the controller? I understand Xbox Wireless is a proprietary protocol and I have not been able to find much info on it, but it does seem use a 2.4ghz band and there are a ton of knockoff Xbox wireless dongles available online so it appears to be that it can be done. Could one of those knockoff dongles be repurposed for my use case?\n\nAs an alternative, I thought about adding a physical switch and RF transmitter to the controller itself and piggybacking the wake signal to bypass the Xbox Wireless protocol altogether and issue my own RF signal but I have not investigated this train of thought much.\n\nAny help or tips appreciated!",
