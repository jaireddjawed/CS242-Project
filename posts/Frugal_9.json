        "text": "Currently I'm in the season of my life as an entrepreneur where my last venture failed, and I'm trying to rebuild myself up again. Right now, my goal is to cut down my monthly expenses to $1500 per month as my income is currently in flux at the moment.  \n\n\nI've sold my car, and purchased a cheap used car for 3500, so no car payments. My insurance drops down to $100 a month as a result. I'm renting a room for $600 a month, which is my biggest expense. With other expenses like gas, utilities, and personal hygiene, I don't have much room left in my budget. Prior to this, I was spending $500-600 a month on food, eating about 2 meals a day.  \n\n\nI'm fully aware that I may be sacrificing my long-term health by doing something like this, but I had to choose between having a roof over my head or living in my car - and since I have quite a small car that definitely wasn't an option. My plan is to do this for 4-6 months while I can increase my income to cover my debts and add to my savings.",

I have still been buying food on campus sometimes instead of packing lunch and buy starbucks maybe once every 2 weeks, but even with grocery shopping i stress out about spending too much and end up not buying enough food.

I know this is the frugal sub but i geuss i just wanted to ask, should I let myself spend money on little things I don't need even when I'm on a budget? I feel like most people I know my age who also talk about not having a lot of money seem like they're buying a lot more than i am and I can't tell if my spending anxiety might be too strict sometimes or if I'm just trying to be more financially responsible.",

        "text": "I just wrote this basic guide and posted it to /r/Anticonsumption but I think people here might like it as well.\n\n________________________________________\n\nIn recent years I've seen many people I know buying new laptops because their old laptop was getting slower, when in fact their old laptop could be perfectly fine if they only took some basic (and affordable!) steps. I decided to write this short guide on how to give new life to an older computer. Nothing here is gonna be new for you if you're a techy person, but I hope it can be of help to those of us who are not particularly computer savvy.\n\nThe way the computer industry works, your brand new computer is built to be obsolete in a few years. Operational systems get heavier and heavier, demanding newer and better hardware, and older systems become unsupported so that using them becomes a security risk. Here are a few steps you can take to break this cycle and keep your older machine working like new:\n\n**1. Install an SSD**\n\nOlder computers came with HDDs for storage. SSDs are significantly faster, and by themselves can make an older computer feel like brand new. In recent years they also became very cheap, so much so that it makes no sense to keep using HDDs for your operating system.\n\nIf you have a desktop computer, you can buy a smaller SSD and use it for the OS and software, and keep using your old HDD to store larger files like pictures, movies and music. In a laptop, you're gonna have to buy an SSD that will fit all your files. Luckily, spending a few extra bucks you can get an enclosure like this one so you can use your old HDD as an external drive. Installing an SSD is also very easy, there are YouTube tutorials if you need but it's very straighforward process.\n\n**2. Upgrade your RAM**\n\nThis isn't always possible as some laptops have soldered RAM chips that can't be replaced, but it's usually worth it if you can. Look up your laptop model online to see how many RAM slots you have (2 if you're lucky) and the max RAM your computer supports. Ideally, you would want to have at least 8GB for comfortable daily use, but 4GB can be enough depending on your OS. Even 2GB can be enough with lightweight OSs, but at that point you'll probably start compromising usability unless your computer use is very basic. Be sure to check online for what kind of RAM chip is the right one your your computer.\n\n**3. Install a Linux distribution**\n\nI know what you're thinking: everyone knows Linux is for nerds and it's very hard for a regular person to install and use it. That used to be true, but fortunately it hasn't been the case for quite a few years now. While some Linux distributions are indeed aimed at advanced users, others are super user friendly and work perfectly and intuitively out of the box. In fact, a very casual user might not even notice they're not using Windows.\n\nThe reason why you should install Linux is that most distributions are very lightweight compared to Windows. A Windows 10 or 11 computer with 4GB RAM and HDD is practically useless, but the same computer will run smoothly with Linux, and like brand new with an upgraded SSD. Another advantage is that Linux systems are completely free and open source, and unlike Windows they do not spy on you nor serve you ads.\n\nWhile there are many Linux distributions, I'll mention Linux Mint and Zorin OS as lightweight and user-friendly operating systems. They're both full-fledged OSs that can do anything a Windows or Mac OS computer can do, they look great and are very easy to use, and they will run very smoothly with only 4GB RAM. There are many other options if you care to look, and the best part is that they're all free and as long as you have a 4GB flash drive you can just download them and try them out running from the USB before you decide to install them (and installing them is super easy too, no need for any technical knowledge).\n\nIf you have less than 4GB RAM there are alternatives like Linux Lite that are extremely lightweight. While they do work, they will feel like a big compromise for casual users, and are generally not worth it since old used laptops are so cheap nowadays.\n\nA caveat: Windows and Mac OS software (obviously) do not work on Linux. There are usually excelent open source alternatives, but before you switch you should make sure all your software needs are covered. Most notably, there's no Microsoft Office for Linux (though Libre Office will serve well 99% of users) and no Adobe Suite (there are great alternatives for casual users but sometimes not for professional users). Firefox and Libre Office usually come preinstalled, and each distribution has an official repository (kind of like an app store except everything is free) with lots of popular software to install with one click.\n\n**4. Get a new battery**\n\nA very old battery isn't just useless, it's a fire hazard. Make this the last step: after you're sure your new old computer is running to your liking, get a new battery and safely dispose of the old one.\n\nThis post was written on an entry level Lenovo laptop from 2013 with 4GB RAM, upgraded with an SSD and a new battery and running Linux Mint. It runs indistinguishably from a brand new entry level laptop running Windows 11. The laptop itself was a hand-me-down (it would have been thrown in the garbage because it can't run Windows 11), and the upgrades cost about $40 . I have a significantly worse desktop computer at home which I use for downloading stuff and playing on my TV with an HDMI cable, and even that one works quite well.\n\nIf you don't have a laptop at all, there are many guides on how to buy an old one (some, like Thinkpads, are well built, longer lasting and more upgradable, and thus very popular among Linux users), but the best laptop is often the one you already have.\n\nI know this guide is very basic but I know a lot of people who don't know this and spend a lot of their hard earned money on brand new computers that won't last them five years, so I hope it helps someone out there.",

        "text": "I’ve had a couple of conversations/experiences that have made me think about this topic. \n\n * My sister has a financial advisor side hustle and it drives her crazy how many of her young, fit clients think the only way to travel is to fly first class and stay in a resort, because when she was young she did a lot of youth exchange programs, backpacking, staying in hostels, etc. and believes stories like “The time I had to sell Marlboros in Thailand to get cash for my hostel” and eating cheap, authentic food (eg homemade Spam musabi in Hawaii) are much more interesting than “It was a beautiful resort in Cabo/Cancun/whereever and I had the steak and lobster.”\n\n * My family has discovered that almost every night we’ve been defaulting to watching whatever streaming show is popular and whenever we get together with family and friends the conversation is the same rehashing of “Remember that part? wasn’t it cool?” Conversations about what we’re watching or reading or listening to from the *library*, however, introduces new ideas into the mix and makes us explain them deeper. \n\n * In developing my kids’ play things, a hand-me-down toy car with a paint job is more uniquely theirs than a brand-new tike car. The Halloween costume I sewed let my three-year-old fulfill her dream of being a “Pink kitty cat with red rainbow hearts on it” instead of another licensed princess. \n\n * Frugal dates, like using a coupon for doing an activity or dessert place we’ve never heard of, are more memorable than dinner and a movie. Frugal hobbies, like making my own fancy bread or sharing a biweekly hike up the same trail for a year, are more memorable than just going out for lunch with the ladies or to the movies. \n\nWhat experiences have you had where being frugal made you a more interesting person?",

Her husband is a real estate agent and she and him basically have 8 or 9 different properties that she rents out or uses as Air BnB.

Beyond my own expenditures, I also send money to my parents every month. My significant other recently got out of college and, even though she is working, she is also 200k in debt, etc. I am generally happy with my life. I'm grateful that at least I am debt free. I'm not worried about the future and I genuinely feel like I have everything I need if not much, much more than that. \n\nI don't know, I just found the conversation kind of annoying.

It seems like the sliding scale of what many now on this site consider to be “working class” is basically a salary of under $1 million, which is just wild to me and grossly out of touch. Inflation is a thing, but since when has a six figure salary been viewed as a pittance?\n\nI understand in high cost of living areas, certain salaries not not go that far, but if you are bringing in $200k a year, or even $150k a year as a single person, you are doing okay!\n\nHow do they think the rest of us who don’t even make six figures survive out in this world? 40% of Americans cannot even afford a $400 emergency without using their credit card. A large portion of boomers have hardly anything in retirement. People who are really struggling don’t have the money for a vacation, or even to save at all.

        "text": "I was looking to get some advice on potentially buying a new versus used car.\n\nEssentially, my girlfriends 2008 Honda CRV rusted out and one of the wheels fell of earlier this week. The entire mount for the wheel rusted off the frame and caused the tire to collapse in on the car. Luckily, she was driving just out of her apartment and wasn't going fast so she was able to maintain control to a stop and no one got hurt. It had passed inspection just a couple of months ago.\n\nWe're still talking with insurance about it, but we believe the car is totaled and not worth repairing. Right now, she's driving my Hyundai Sonata 2016 Hybrid w/ just over 100k miles on it. I have been driving around one of my parents' cars in the meantime as they don't always need theirs. We are going to look at some Honda Civic's and other small options for around 5-7k with about 120-130k miles on them ranging from a 2009 civic to a 2012 civic. I have the Dave Ramsey steps seared into my brain so I know something like this would be the \"smart\" choice.\n\nAdditionally, we probably haven't looked hard or long enough, but most of the used cars around here in the 10-15k range don't seem to be worth all that much, or they are an unfavorable brand/model. I also kind of think that a good warranty might be worth spending the extra and not having to worry about it.\n\nUnfortunately, we live in the northern states and salt rips cars apart up here. Assuming we could find a civic that is rust free (or at least not rusted through) I assume that would be the best option?\n\nThe caveat is that last year she had brain surgery and a number of smaller procedures to fix issues found after a car crash. We have been advised that blows to the head could be fatal. I worry about, and honestly am losing sleep over, getting her a civic because it is the smart choice, and having something go wrong with the car within the same vein of her CRV and us not getting lucky this time with how fast she was going and where she was.\n\nI am rolling around the idea in my head of me buying a new car and letting her continue to use my Sonata as I know it has been well taken care of. I was looking at the 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid or the 2023 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid, both just the base model, I don't need anything fancy. The Toyota's are basically impossible to find without a 5-6 month wait it seems like here. There are a number of Hyundai Elantra's on lots near me at the base price which seems to be my best choice if I was going to buy a new car.\n\nWith my current situation and credit score, I can put 15k down and then my monthly payments would be roughly 200-300 (ish). This is definitely doable, but I don't know if it makes the most sense. I haven't had a problem with my Sonata at all, though I hear some people have problems with Elantras (though I think that no matter where you look someone will always have a bad experience with pretty much any car).\n\nAnyone have any opinions?",

Turns out this is not uncommon with these GE microwaves.\n\nI ordered a replacement bracket online which showed up last night and ten minutes later had a working microwave again. \n\nIt's one of those that sits over the stove and acts as a range hood too and wouldn't have been cheap or easy to replace so it was immensely satisfying to fix it for the cost of a new bracket (about $30) and a few fuses ($9).",
