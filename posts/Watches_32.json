I've decided on my ultimate 5-watch collection, and until yesterday, I had 2/5 (Mido Dual Time and a rare pre-Invicta Airman with 12 on top). I don't yet have a Grand Seiko GMT BGJ249 and Nomos Zurich Weltzeit.

It usually fits ok if I go to the last hole but the astetics aren't great. I tried buying a deplyant strap but I ended up having to cut it to the last hole and the clasp ended up being on the side of my wrist and was uncomfortable. I saw delugs has some rubber straps you can cut on both ends but they're like $150 and I was hoping not to spend that much and ideally I'd like to use straps I already have. That being said do you know of any claps that use some sort of mechanism to allow me to cut each end of a strap and make it a deplyant clasp? \n\nThanks in advance for the help",

Walmart and Macy had some great watches that I would have pulled the trigger on, but as luck would have it, they don’t ship to Hawaii.\n\nNothing incredibly enticing (sale-wise) on the other sites but I’ve heard great things about them so will keep looking.\n\nA bit skeptical about eBay since I’ve heard stories of fake watches. So I’m not sure how much I trust their authentication.\n\nr/watchexchange is wonderful if you can beat the crowd on the deals.\n\nFB Marketplace has been a total flop as everyone seems to be overpricing their watches.",

Looking for a bit of a bespoke ask - an open heart that's 39mm or less in diameter, with an open heart and a date.\n\nI've only been able to find two basically - and neither are 39mm or less. Maybe I'm looking for a unicorn so if I need to concede &gt;39mm I guess I'll have to! But I figured if anyone knows what I might be looking for - it'd be this community!\n\nThe open heart makes it complicated (pun intended) to have a calendar/date function. Since it's open, it can't have a traditional date wheel so it relies on the date function via hands on the watch...\n\nTwo examples here:\n\n[https://www.chrono24.com/orient/contemporary--mechanical-mechanical-moonphase-re-ay0005a00b-herren-automatikuhr-mondphase--id21847416.htm](https://www.chrono24.com/orient/contemporary--mechanical-mechanical-moonphase-re-ay0005a00b-herren-automatikuhr-mondphase--id21847416.htm)\n\n[https://www.chrono24.com/frederiqueconstant/frederique-constant-classics-moonphase-heart-beat-silver-dial-black-leather--id7041252.htm](https://www.chrono24.com/frederiqueconstant/frederique-constant-classics-moonphase-heart-beat-silver-dial-black-leather--id7041252.htm)\n\nMoon phase not required - but definitely added value!

        "text": "Looking for your suggestions! I'm very attracted to all the Baltic watches but particularly the dual-crown, though some say the movement is noisy and there are QC issues with the bezel. Also attracted to the Unimatic U1S-T-MP but some say the lug design makes it not so easy to wear. Also like the look of the Aevig Huldra. Are there other watches in this design ballpark I ought be considering? Let's say under $1500. I have a 7\" wrist and am not a fan of super large watches. Currently own the Aevig Corvid automatic (40) and the Sinn 556i (38.5) and I like how those fit on me. Thank you!",
