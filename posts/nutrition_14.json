        "text": "I’ve been exploring Plant-Based (and in come cases, vegan) recipes and I’ve noticed a lot (and I mean *a lot*) of improvements in my overall well-being…But I’m curious : Being from the US, where much of our food is factory-farmed, coated in pesticides, highly processed, and mass-produced – is it meat, seafood, and dairy which are irritating me, or just **THE QUALITY** of meat, seafood, and dairy we have in America?\n\nI have a Forks Over Knives magazine and it’s hard not to gape at the transformations and assume this is the cheat code to building a truly healthy lifestyle…But – then I think of The Blue Zones (like in The Mediterranean, for instance) and how they do eat some meat (mostly lamb and chicken, I believe) and some dairy – and have even higher rates of healthiness than vegans and WFPB-eaters do. Could it be less about meat, seafood, and dairy being inherently unhealthy and more about me not having access to (or even awareness of) minimally-processed and ‘healthy’ meat, seafood, and dairy?",

Clearly, we all know that whole wheat is healthier because of bran and germ, which contain fiber, vitamins and minerals, which endosperm doesn't have on its own. \n\nNow, what I'm wondering, how can whole wheat be better, if there is a lot of \"anti-nutrients\" in bran and germ (phytic acid, tannins...). \n\nRefining wheat also increases it shelf life. Aren't bran and germ just protectors of endosperm, so humans could safely consume endosperm?\n\nDo these compounds actually have any role that is good for us? How can whole wheat be better if it has these chemicals in it?\n\n**This is a serious thing, so please don't reply if you only have google knowledge.**\n(I would like if someone with actual school about nutrition (professional) answers this, thank you.)",

How familiar are you with the Gracie diet? Is it something you would recommend for a client? I have a client (personal training) who is considering jujitsu, and this diet has been mentioned in a few videos this client has been watching.\n\nThe information I find about it seems to be consistent with complexities I don’t necessarily agree with. I am studying to become a nutritionist, so my nutritional knowledge is still pretty base, and some of the aspects of the diet don’t necessarily make sense to me. One part that has me asking questions is, what sort of actual research and data supports that mixing certain foods during a meal will either positively or negatively affect you? Any clarity or useful research sites anybody can recommend would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

By that I mean the most cost-effective health-wise. Some cultures don't grow massively diverse amounts of vegetables like in West Africa, where you find different types of leaves, cabbage, okro and that's mostly about it. I feel like most people eat most of the time onions and tomatoes as base ingredients for stews and stuff, is that enough?",

I'm a long-time user of MFP, but (aside from macros) it only tracks a couple of micronutrients (Vit A, C, Calcium, Iron, Potassium, Sodium). \n\nIs it difficult to do? Is it because of inaccuracies that can't be accounted for? What is a good way to keep track of intake?",

But 40% of 1750calories/day would be 175g-180g or protein. \n\nSo how am I looking at this wrong? \nCan someone shed some light? \n\nThank you!!",
