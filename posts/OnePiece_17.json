You all Kid fans should get ready to pack up your stuff and join the other train because this train is gonna derail and crash when Shanks shows up. Not to mention the majority of the One Piece fandom doesn't give a care about some red headed punk who thought he could even come near Shanks and Shanks has been there since the beginning. Ok that's all I had to say can't wait for the chapter when we will see Kid lying on Shanks feet.",

Garp's daughter got down and freaky with Dragon and Dragon's real father is none other than Rocks D Xebec. \n\nTheory scenario: When Garp and Roger defeated Xebec in God Valley, the young Dragon was there and when Xebec was defeated but not dead yet he asked Garp to take care of Dragon secretly. Before the navy proceed with the Buster Call and obliterate the whole island. \n\nThis is also the reason, why Roger, the Pirate King entrusted Ace to Garp. But it doesn't make any sense for Roger to do that, why would Roger suddenly entrust Ace to Garp, when in fact he could've chosen Rayleigh or WhiteBeard, he and White Beard shares a mutual respect, same way with Garp. It would only make sense if Roger saw what happened with Xebec and Dragon and that even though Xebec was the enemy and the worst pirate of all, Garp still did right thing and adopted the young Dragon. \n\nAnd at some point he probably even became a navy/marine and like I said got down and freaky with Garp's daughter but along the way he saw how cruel, unjust and disgusting the celestial dragon and the world nobles are and that's When he left they navy and founded the Revolutionary army. \n\nDragon doesn't look like Luffy at all, Luffy looks like Garp, because Luffy got it from Garp's daughters. Dragon's eyebrow is similar to Super Saiyan 3 of Son Goku and Dragon's demeanor and the way he carries himself is the opposite of Luffy. \n\nLuffy=Goofball and always smiling and only gets crazy angry when you mess with his friends. Luffy has more similarities with Roger and Garp than his own father. \n\nDragon=Reserved and rarely shows an emotion. I am assuming that Dragon inherited that personality from Xebec. Photo below is from Vivre Card databook\n\n\n\n\n“His card mildly hints at a possible secret about his past. However, it says that even if his subordinates learned the truth, they'd still follow him without a doubt\" \n\nThe secret about his past is NOT about Luffy or Garp, that kind of secret would not make your subordinates leave you. Dragon's secret is his real father, the same way with Ace. And to quote Ace “both me and Luffy carries the blood of a world renowned criminal” Ironic because Dragon is also carrying the blood of a world renowned criminal/pirate. \n\nI also want to note that Garp never once refer to Dragon as “my son\" it's always “your dad\" or “your father\" when talking to Luffy. \n\nWell there ya go, hope you enjoyed reading my theory.",

So I am pretty sure a seraphim with strong enough will power can override their commands given to them.

        "text": "The long-awaited **chapter 1077** of One Piece is finally out. Again we were not shown who the **mysterious traitor** of this saga could be, but surely after this chapter and after **Shaka**'s assassination, we can certainly get an idea.\n\nBefore going on to explain who this character could be in my opinion, I would like to list who it definitely CANNOT be. To do this we need to establish what characteristics the culprit must possess.\n\n1) **The culprit must have been present on the island for several months.** As is revealed in chapter 1076, the disappearances of the various **members of the CP5, CP7, and CP8** sent to Egghead to check on Vegapunk’s work, date back at least **2 months ago** and was caused by the **sea beast weapons** (probably controlled by someone able to do that). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjhqwzrhdwma1.png?width=392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b477ab9239465a375c5aaba6da2bd96aa3a0387d\n\n2) **This character must have the ability to control the seraphim.** As we know the control of the seraphim takes place thanks to a precise **hierarchy** explained by **Stussy** in chapter 1069. At the top of the hierarchy, there are the **5 elders**, followed by **Vegapunk (Stella and satellites)**, **Sentomaru** and finally by the **owners of an authority chip**. If you don’t own an authority chip or are one of the characters listed above, you cannot give an order to the seraphim.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5ml2pamdwma1.png?width=281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c06fcf3ff4a2d905645199bef122be90e541a38\n\n3) **The traitor must be someone who knows the lab very well.** In chapter 1071 we discover that someone has **deactivated the frontier dome**, the barrier that protects the laboratory. A character unaware of the island's various **mechanisms** could never perform such an action. This action doesn't even seem random since it happens just when **Luffy's group** returns to the **laboratory with Vegapunk** and **Lucci** prepares to **invade the building**.\n\nBased on these characteristics, which must all match the capabilities of the character in question, we can already eliminate a few names from the list:\n\n* **Caribou.** I honestly never understood the idea that many have he could be the culprit. First of all because in chapter 1065 when Zoro chases Caribou from the ship, he is scared by the fact that Egghead is a **government island**, consequently he cannot have the slightest idea of how the laboratory works and above all he has no idea what even the **frontier dome** is. Moreover, on a narrative level, this choice would not make much sense.\n* **Saturn**. Many thought that the gorosei was responsible for the mess that is happening on the island but even here there are various reasons to think it is not him. The imminent arrival of Saturn is revealed only in **chapter 1073**, when the frontier dome has already been deactivated. Furthermore it is explained to us that an order can only be given to seraphim directly and NOT through **Den Den Mushi**. To conclude, the traitor's silhouette that we see in chapter 1075 makes it clear that the traitor was already present on the island, an arrival of a gorosei and above all Kizaru would be easily picked up by the strongest Mugiwara (Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Jinbe).\n* **S-Flamingo**. A character who has made a lot of talk about himself in recent weeks is **Doflamingo's seraphim**. I would exclude this option a priori as it is very unlikely that a seraphim is able to **give orders** to his fellow men and above all to have such an intelligence as to act alone without someone above him. We have seen that all seraphim except S-Snake are not even able to speak, let alone even **sabotage the entire laboratory**.\n\nThis leads us to think that the traitor must be one of the punks. Let's see one by one which satellites are most likely to be part of the sabotage:\n\n* **Shaka** was for a long time the main suspect by a large part of the fanbase but given the latest events in 1077, I think that getting **shot** in the head and drawing blood from the skull is reason enough to exclude punk 01 from this hunt for the traitor.\n* **Lilith** and **York** could easily be ruled out as they were **petrified by S-Snake**.\n* **Edison**, another prime suspect is seen in this chapter to have been **knocked out by S-Shark**.\n\nThe only two satellites on which we can still have doubts are two: **Pythagoras** and **Atlas**. However, the latter should in my opinion be excluded for obvious reasons: after **being knocked out by Lucci** in chapter 1068 she remained unconscious and **under repair** until chapter 1074, the same chapter where we see **Pythagoras** was attacked by **someone in the shadows**. However, he is not to be excluded since in this last chapter after the petrification of Franky's group, he is **not seen again**. Did he head to the dungeons right after? Unlikely but not impossible. However, him being the traitor wouldn’t explain who the **person in the shadow** was that attacked him. \n\nMy guess is that the traitor is actually **one of the punks** but not one of the 6 that were presented to us, but **a seventh**. The latter could be presented as **Vegapunk 00**, a further expansion of the scientist who, however, the other punks do not know or do not know actually **came to life**. This seventh punk could have been created by the artificial intelligence itself, **Punk Records** and whose goal is to **eliminate all the other satellites**. A mini clue that made me think about this were the words of Pythagoras when asked by Lilith who created that explosion earlier:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/he3em1uxdwma1.png?width=137&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c9b2d6dd32c6c0ca627a2d714407a5edecb11237\n\nHowever, here it is not clear whether Pythagoras was referring to the traitor or to S-Snake but what convinced me 100% that he wasn’t, is the **onomatopoeia of the footsteps** of this figure which is equally represented both when **Pythagoras is about to be attacked** and in this **last chapter**:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4rulli1ewma1.png?width=476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7d9ed079284caf700f26fab00f7c2ef2571b9606\n\nIt could also be that Vegapunk himself does not know the existence of this satellite and that it was created automatically by **Punk Records** itself. The presence of a seventh satellite would explain many things and above all it would make sense, being a character who moves in the shadows that none of the punks suspects is around the laboratory and who above all is able to do everything that only a punk could do: **deactivate the frontier dome, give a direct order to the seraphim, take Vegapunk to the dungeons** where perhaps he himself was created etc...\n\nFor the moment it is almost impossible for us to identify this character, but among all the hypotheses, the most plausible is that this is a character that has not yet been seen since almost all the others have an alibi or have demonstrated by being petrified or attacked that they are not They. Hopefully, 1078 will give us a clearer answer to this.",

        "text": "I have a theory on who the “traitor” is. And it’s someone we all miss so dearly. It’s Bon Clay.\n\nI think the title of the last chapter kinda spoiled it. “You should’ve put it together sooner” can apply to Zoro BUT at the same time can apply to us the readers. Like it’s a message from Oda that we should’ve realized this sooner. We haven’t seen or heard of Bon Clay since Impel Down which is weird considering that was a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I would think that the person who was left and literally released all the prisoners of impel down free would be severely punished by the World Government. So here’s what I think happened, Bon Clay got experimented on repeatedly by Vegapunk so he can get Bon Clay’s DF powers which is an insanely valuable asset for the World Government. But he escaped so he’s mad as heck at Vegapunk. So he’s sabotaging everything he worked on by pretending to be Stella. I would think that awakening his fruit would be something like it cant be detected or you would even get the memories. When the Strawhats finally came, he was finally happy to reunite with Luffy so he was like okay I’m out but at the same time screw all the satellites and actual Vegapunk in the process. It kinda makes sense to me considering we know how Oda likes forshadowing a lot.",

Also I'm not a vocal coach or expert but her singing wasn't even that good it only made her even more annoying.

It was trying to make me feel sympathy for Uta but failed massively. Zephyr's final scene in Film Z is light years ahead of this forced cringey trash.\n\nAlso, sad to say but this film kinda ruined Shanks's character for me a little bit.

The shadow we saw could be Cesar's gas form, let's remember the first time we saw ceasar he changed his form to a gas. Additionally, we know that the traitor must know how egg head works, because the deffence mechanisms were disable for a bit, if anyone was able to break through the defense and the security system I can't think of a better team than ceasar and judge. \n\nThere's a lot of claims that the shadow is the the member of the gorosei that we saw with kizaru, but I think if kizaru was on the island we would know it. Let's be honest stealth is not his strongest quality. Even when he arrived to defeat the supernovas some of his simplest attacks (a basic kick and some lasers) seemed to be leveling buildings. At the moment the Vegapunks haven't confirmed seeing or hearing any destruction outside, so I think it's safe to say they are not in the island yet.",

Since he was beaten by Luffy I think that proves that he's not at Rodgers level yet since I also think Luffy us not at Rodgers level.\n\nAnd if I were to argue whether Shanks is at that level I'd say he's pretty close that's why he could stop Kaido from going to the war at marine ford.",

This arc has honestly been all about Kuma, so it would not surprise me at all if there is such a callback. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, I think these are the potential culprits : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. S-Flamingo\n2. Laffite \n3. Someone who has the Shadow-Shadow fruit or a copy of the Shadow-Shadow fruit \n4. Someone who has the Clear-Clear fruit or a copy of the Clear-Clear fruit \n5. S-Bat ( Seraphim Gecko Moria )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind that I don't think any of the above did **ALL** of the weird mysterious stuff that has been happening. For example, if Laffite is involved, I don't think that he has been the one kidnapping the Cipher Pol agents. Which is why I believe that there are most likely at least two culprits who may or may not have unrelated goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince there are likely two or more suspects, I have also considered the possibility that one has a fruit ability that allow them to move around completely invisible to the naked eye, and another has a fruit that allows them to disguise themselves as another person. So someone with either the Kitsune/Nine Tailed Fox fruit or the Clone-Clone fruit of Bon Clay or a copy thereof, and someone with the Shadow-Shadow fruit or the Clear-Clear fruit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut idk, I could be completely wrong. I just wanted to throw this out there in case I get any of this right lol.",
