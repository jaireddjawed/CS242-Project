This is egregious but it only exists on top of the voter suppression, voter purges and lack of accountability we already have in our electoral process (which are accelerating). I suspect Repubs feel comfortable behaving in such openly ghoulish ways because they treat their wins as inevitable. They can cheat and even if they got caught cheating there'd be no consequences for it. \n\nNo funny jokes or real copypasta, I just feel really bad about this because I think people are putting a lot of hope in things that only exist through the graces of their political opponents.

End private ownership altogether and let everyone make more. Mathematically workers producing their own wealth should keep it, its the only way. Redistribution works because there too many people with not enough wealth. The people you think you are helping would starve the rich to death, as they themselves have been in all of human history when capitalism's been tried. What I want to tell you to trigger the fuck out of you? Beat the rich with dildos and put them in concentration camps.",

It’s not like several thousand movies have already done that. It’s two brown kids and I’m positive something awful will happen to them in the next ten seconds. \n\n0:01:35 - Lebanon! The cool new place where nothing ever happened! These kids are definitely getting drone bombed. Well, normal bombed. No drones yet. \n\n0:02:35 - And here come the Americans! Destroyed the city these two kids were living in. Here’s what’s bullshit tho. Throwing this way back in the past is like “wow, I can’t believe this once happened” as if it’s not happening like right now. \n\n0:03:17 - Jesus that is an absurd closeup on Jim’s face. Who chose this shot? The titular character is rowing a boat, which is totally cool and masculine btw, and they just zoom way in on his nostrils. Clever shot choice. \n\n0:03:25 - Of course he rides his bike to work. \n\n0:03:51 - WENDELL PIERCE IS IN THIS!? Oh hell yeah baby. I retract all criticism. \n\n0:04:34 - He’s a PhD and an Oriels fan lol good exposition. \n\n0:05:01 - God, so many lanyards. \n\n0:06:10 - Pierce’s character is divorced. Again, totally natural and normal exposition. Way to build characters. He did something bad, and since he’s black im guess they’re gonna try and be edgy and make it a shooting of a white kid or something. Oh also, he and Jim had an altercation before they came in and NOW THEY’RE WORKING TOGETHER! Whacky! \n\n0:07:33 - Wow, they’re going around the table introducing themselves. Excellent. Good use of time. This definitely needed to be...A FUCKING HOUR LONG!? Jesus Christ. \n\n0:09:46 - The main villain is called “man of peace” which is obviously supposed to be like a dig at the “lol Islam’s a religion of peace.” \n\n0:11:51 - Now we’re off to Syria, where brown people with guns and beards are driving pickup trucks. There’s some sort of sectarian nonsense going on. \n\n0:23:52 - Jeopardy is on in the background and Jim is SO GOOD AT IT!!!\n\n0:15:02 - Jim is having a VERY Apocalypse Now moment, complete with the flashback and ceiling fan. It’s weird because they already referenced that film, so it feels like more theft than homage. Also he probably killed a kid. \n\n0:17:56 - not to be all CinemaSins but “come take a look at this” cliche. \n\n0:19:00 - Jim’s big break is he found $19 million transferred to Syria from a shell account. That’s what Dick Cheney probably pulls in a week to buy children to steal their organs. \n\n0:19:04 - REVISIONIST HISTORY Jim says “don’t you think people wish they had this opportunity the first time they heard the name Bin Laden?” ALL THESE FUCKS HAD HEARD OF BIN LADEN? Who does he think was signing for the weapons shipments to Afghanistan?\n\n0:20:00 - Pierce doesn’t believe him, and won’t freeze the $19 million account, which, tbh is a good idea because following that money almost certainly would lead back to one of his bosses, or one of their golf buddies.   \n\n0:22:14 - was that Oriels joke earlier too subtle? Let’s give Jim a baseball to hold in his hand in half the scenes because we REALLY want you to know that he’s a baseball fan. \n\n0:24:09 - they let Jim sorta try to be funny for a minute, which was a mistake because it didn’t land. He was trying to convince someone in the treasury department to go over Pierce’s head and was like “I can’t believe people say treasury doesn’t do anything” in his Jim voice. \n\n0:23:32 - the treasury woman is a total dork you guys, please relate to her dorkiness! Please. Please clap. \n\n0:24:06 - lol the woman in Syria’s kids drew outlines of themselves in chalk, and she looks at it, and I think the show thinks this is good subtle foreshadowing. \n\n0:25:15 - uh oh, Pierce is mad! I wonder if the titular character is gonna get fired in the first episode! Also,  I didn’t mention it earlier but the Apocalypse Now reference was someone calling someone who dipped bullets in pigs blood to harass Muslim troops “Kurtz” which MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE. I’m starting to think these writers didn’t really get Apocalypse Now. \n\n0:26:34 - Wait it’s $9 million? Lol okay I guess. \n\n0:27:27 - something is about to happen. What? Several b roll shots of a generic marketplace. Where? It doesn’t matter. \n\n0:28:06 - they say “military age male” which means basically any age. \n\n0:29:01 - they have a bad pen microphone and it’s set in present day? They can’t like buy a zoom or something? \n\n0:31:03 - some white dude kidnaped the “military age males” \n\n0:31:32 - Jim’s back story was told via internet news scroll. He was a marine, the only in his platoon to survive. He was in a wheelchair once. \n\n0:32:12 - Abe Simpson voice: there are too many characters named Jim, please eliminate three. \n\n0:33:13 - Jim’s friend is a Wall Street guy and so was Jim once! Don’t worry Jim, I’ve read the books, they give you a bunch of money. \n\n0:34:26 - I think this is his wife he’s meeting? I mean, not yet. I’m pretty sure she was a nurse in the books, but they made her a doctor so Amber doesn’t write a think piece about them. \n\n0:35:36 - they send a helicopter to pick up this fucking nerd from a party. This is so silly. \n\n0:37:14 - he’s going to Yemen to torture people. \n\n0:39:27 - the solider who greets them in Yemen is wearing a Nirvana shirt. President Xi you may fire when ready. \n\n0:40:00 - incoming justification of torture. \n\n0:41:19 - they’re blasting country music at the prisoners. \n\n0:42:33 - super awkward Fanta product placement. \n\n0:45:58. - Jim brings him food and water. What a guy. \n\n0:46:20 - this absolutely did not need to be an hour. \n\n0:47:00 - Jim is winning him over with his charm. \n\n0:48:20 - there’s a fake death lol amazing. \n\n0:52:22 - the base is getting rolled by the Nag Guys (tm). \n\n0:53:14 - lol they forgot to lock the door \n\n0:55:13 - the non bad guy was the real bad guy\n\n0:57:17 - the action scenes are directed like absolute dog shit my god. It’s just a bunch of close ups, shooting, etc. \n\nEnd - this show fucking sucks. It’s boring more than anything. I’ll keep st it, but this is a slog. It’s just so generic. \n\n\n",

        "text": "I know I’ll get downvoted to hell for this, but oh well.\n\nReally? Herstory? I find it incredibly ironic that in one word you attempt to completely exclude the male element and within the same sentence, you become male inclusive . What purpose does this serve? You’ve literally negated your own point, even if that point is coming from ignorance.\n\nI am a male feminist. I have been since I can remember. I fight for, and support, equality tooth and nail. This does nothing to further the feminist agenda. This does nothing to prove equality among the sexes. All it does is create some artificial buzzword that in reality, is simply an attempt to remove men from the equation. How does that move us forward? How is that not the EXACT same line of thinking that created inequality between the sexes in the first place? How on earth is it considered equal to remove one gender from any concept simply based on said gender? That’s not equality and it’s no different from the bullshit men have been pulling for centuries.\n\nYou’re not furthering equal rights by trying to make this word a thing. Or any other iteration of removing ‘his’, ‘men’, ‘man’, etc. from a word. Often, the etymology doesn’t even have anything to do with gender. Often, it’s simply a translation from one language to another to another that simply maintains one of the aforementioned prefixes.\n\nWhat’s next? Womano a Womano instead of Mano a Mano? Oops...never mind, Mano is Spanish for hand and translates to “hand to hand” and literally has nothing to do with men, but applying the same logic as “herstory” would mean we should change that, right? I mean, we have to create equality by completely removing one gender from all aspects of society and language, right? That’s how we get true equality, right? By removing a gender based wholly on the fact that they were born said gender?",
