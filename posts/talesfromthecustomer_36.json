        "text": "I gave up on magazine subscriptions a long time ago, and after what my mother went through with the local newspaper, I was ready to give up on that. But she was talked into getting another subscription. The bill came with today's paper. My mother paid for 26 weeks, but the bill said we were paid up for 25 weeks. I checked our account online, and that renewal date was one week later than the paper bill. We would lose one dollar if we renewed with the paper bill, so my mother *again* plans to call the paper to complain about this. Over a dollar. What a waste of time for a dollar. But I told her this is what you get for resubscribing.\n\nI am convinced most magazine companies are run by crooks. They especially try to trick elder customers into renewing their subscriptions before they need to be renewed, which also happened to my mother. She had a subscription through a certain point, but long before that renewal date came, another bill showed up. It also advertised that if she renewed, she would get a free subscription to another magazine. So she did. *Then another bill showed up!* She was confused and thought she was getting ripped off because the new bill's date did not sync with the other bill's date. I called the company, and the rep confirmed that what she thought her subscription was, was what she was getting. The other bill? *Oh, that's something else, unrelated.* Sure, it is. You're probably just trying to get my mother to renew for *another* year so your subscriber base will look at good as possible.\n\nThat's not even the dirtiest trick. My mother occasionally gets a completely random magazine out of the blue. She never subscribed to it. I think the magazine companies try to get older people to *think* that they *are* subscribed to it, and then they try to get them to pay for a new subscription that way. But the worst trick? Sometimes a magazine company will send a \"renewal notice,\" which looks and sounds like a bill, and is written like the person is a subscriber, to try to trick the old into \"renewing.\"",

        "text": "Hey, guys! This happened a few years ago and I am usually not one to pull the race card, but I honestly think that was the case because this friend (we'll call her M) and I (we're black) were singled out of a group with 2 other people (they'll be D and A) (who are white).\n\nSo A, D, M, and I all worked together as servers at a restaurant in a mall. This restaurant was literally directly across from the store in question. They sell a lot of stuff *for your entertainment* like video games, CDs, DVDs, and gaming consoles. The 4 of us decided to head over there after our shifts and browse a little. I had a DVD I had been looking for, so we all head over to the DVD section. We are browsing in separate areas of the same section, but I was the only one who was planning to buy anything. They didn't have what I wanted, so we headed out.\n\nM was staying with A for a while, so they were waiting for her dad. I was taking the bus home and had some time to kill. And D was just passing time with us (he had a crush on A).\n\nAnyway, we all leave the store. M and I decide to separate from D and A to go to a different store, a little ways up from where we were. The other 2 went in the opposite direction. M and I find a store we want to go into and are browsing and chatting when an employee from *entertainment store* and a security guard approach us. They ask if we had been in *entertainment store* and we say that we had. They ask us to come with them, not telling us why.\n\nWe are confused and M asks if they need the other 2 who were with us. The employee shakes his head and says it's just us. She and I are getting annoyed and as we get closer to the store, the employee says, without even bothering to look back at us, that he would only want to talk to the other 2 if we handed the disc off to one of them.\n\nWe are angry and even more confused now because we have no idea what he's talking about, and we are being singled out. We get back into the store and he looks at us expectantly, telling us to hand over the copy of *Mean Girls*. M and I would have found it funny if he wasn't so rude because that's not something either of us would want to watch, let alone steal.\n\nThe guy holds us there for a few more minutes and has us wait while he went in the back for who even knows why. He comes back out and tells us (rudely) that we're free to go. We were barely out of high school at the time and didn't know any better, or we would have made much more of a stink about it. I know now that that guy definitely broke policy by approaching us himself, especially without proof of any kind. But I'll settle for the knowledge that we probably weren't the last he did that to and that someone else probably did complain. ",

We'd had a prearranged cut appt for 3 weeks before my niece's wedding. I arrive at the salon only to discover she had been hospitalized for a severe pulmonary infection. She was hospitalized for quite a while and unable to make some car payments. As a result, her car was repossessed. I knew NOTHING ABOUT THIS. One day in the pretty recent past she was cutting my hair cut around 6pm. She asked me if I could drive her to the bus stop. No, I said, but I could drive her to where she wanted to go. We wound up going out to dinner on my dime. I learned how she lost her car (not being able to catch up after being so sick for so long). \n\nI had given a different  niece my car instead of trading it in 2 days prior to this and I had to get rid of her car. I asked her if she wanted it so she didn't have to take the bus any longer-she had her brother, a mechanic, check it out and he said it was fine. Now my hairdresser has a drivable car and life is good.\n\nSo, all of you customers, when someone who regularly performs a service for you and something is 'off' try to find out why. Maybe you can change their life!",

        "text": "Just discovered this subreddit, posting from mobile so I'm sorry for the formatting!\n\nAnyways, this incident has been burned into my memory forever, since it was something that happened to me almost 7 years ago and I still remember my embarrassment. So for some background, I was a kid around 13 years old at the time, still in middle school. I was pretty much the stereotype of the extremely shy quiet girl. So because of this, I was always too nervous to place orders when I went out to get food with my mom, so she would normally do it for me. At this time however, I had finally had the courage to start doing things for myself, but obviously I was still young and fairly new to this whole \"having conversations with people\" thing.\n\nSo this one day, my mom took us to get sandwiches at our local sub shop, and I went to place my own order for the first time in that kind of shop (the kind where you go step by step to build your own sandwich). I was honestly nervous about it and I'm sure it showed. The following interaction took place between me and the lady taking my order:\n\nMe: \"Um, hi, uhh... Can I have a 6 inch sub on herbs and cheese bread?\"\n\nLady: \"What kind of sandwich?\"\n\nMe: (Confused, I thought maybe she didn't hear me) \"Uhh... A 6 inch herbs and cheese.\"\n\nLady: (Getting annoyed) \"What KIND of sandwich?\"\n\nMe: (At this point I'm lost) \"Um... I'm sorry, a 6 inch herbs and cheese..?\"\n\nLady: (Raising her voice) \"What KIND of sandwich do you want???\"\n\nMe: (I'm honestly stumped because at this point she has my bread ready and I don't know what she means by what kind) \"Uh....\"\n\nLady: (She's had it with me at this point) \"WHAT MEAT DO YOU WANT??\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, um, I'm sorry, turkey?\"\n\nOddly enough, after this, the rest of the exchange is fine. But I still remember being shocked that she raised her voice and got annoyed at me, since I was literally a CHILD. I almost cried right there in the store because I was so embarrassed and I felt kind of humiliated by this lady. I even remember being nervous to go back there after that! But it's definitely been a story that stuck with me, and I still am confused today why anyone would feel the need to raise their voice and act like that towards someone who is obviously just a nervous child. Especially if that child clearly doesn't understand what you are saying, why wouldn't you immediately clarify or rephrase it then? It still makes me frustrated to think about.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, my mom was busy at the moment this was happening to me, so she didn't realize until afterwards when I told her. Otherwise, she would have certainly made a point to call this lady out for talking to me like that.",

I keep mine zipped up in my bag all day and check it once I get to my car.\n\nEnd of the day; I hop in my car and instinctively reach for my phone. No phone! I go back in and check everywhere, check my bag (which had been unzipped), and car. Nada. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is that maybe...hopefully not...one of the kids has taken it while I was out on a field trip to the park. My only option is to go to Electronics Store to buy another one.\n\nAt the Electronics Store, I start looking until I am approached by Salesman. He asks if I need help, and I briefly explain the problem and how I need to buy a new phone and hopefully transfer my number. \"No problem\", he says.\n\nThree hours later... I have spoken to over a dozen different people on the Store's phone with the carrier. I have been brought to frustration tears brimming my eyes, and poor Salesman has been patiently stuck with me. The store closes and he is still helping me, through all my apologies about holding him up from doing other things. Finally, I am able to walk out with a working phone.\n\nI know that this is a good forum to rant about terrible service, but I have been in retail for years and know what it is like to deal with a difficult customer; and today I felt like I was that customer. To Saintly Salesman, thank you for helping me and putting up with my frustrations, as well as keeping calm and smiling. In that three hours, I literally tried to find a logical way to blame the believed ghost that haunts the place over the idea of one of my students taking my phone. Thank you thank you Salesman at Electronics Store!",

I hate buying it because I don't know the difference between a zinfandel or rosé or whatever other kind of alcohol they sell. (I had to google those two terms just now.)\n\nSo I walk in, and I'm the *only* customer in the store at the moment. Cool, because that means the employee can help me find something! So I ask her if I can get help, and the conversation went a little like this:\n\n&gt;**Me:** Hi! I almost never buy alcohol, so I don't know much about it, and I'm looking for a... *[glances at phone shopping list]* strawberry champagne. Could you help me find it?\n\n&gt;**Her:** Okay, I'm not sure if we have that. *[Walks around counter, and speaks closely to me in hushed tones.]* But you should know that what you're doing is a crime. You should not have started off the conversation that way. I legally cannot sell you anything, because what you're doing is called \"buying by proxy\" and it means you're intending to buy the alcohol for someone else. You're buying for people who are underage; it's a crime, and I'd also be committing a crime if I helped you.\n\n&gt;**Me:** *Or,* I'm buying it for my wife, so she can use it in a cake recipe.\n\n&gt;**Her:** ... [Pause. Slight smile creeps in.] Okay! Sorry, but well, yeah, that makes sense. I don't think we have a strawberry champagne anyway. You should try [nearby store] because they have a better selection.\n\nI kind of laughed it off, but I was surprised by how serious she got, how she approached me closely, and immediately accused me of buying strawberry champagne for a bunch of teens or something. It was weird. I guess I'll chalk it up to inexperience!",

I've been a very,very happy, loyal customer of this webhosting company for almost 15 years now, always been an advocate of it I guess, I used this shared host for my not- too busy sites, and been always very happy, always had stellar help when needed. Most of the sites were hand coded, only a few ran on Wordpress. \n\nSuddenly, one of my mates calls me, his site is down. I tell him not to worry, sometimes maintenance, 99.99% uptime blabla, and I check it out. Seems my whole account has being deactivated due to \"malware\".\n\nSo, I contacted the helpdesk/chat. They told me I had to pay 250$ to use a tool to scan my files, upon which I requested a supervisor who eventually told me he'd do the scan for free, and the 350$ was really an \"extra service\" for the noobs, but I'd have to wait e few hours for the scan to complete.\nThe next day, I found a text file from their tool stating 99.98% of my files were infected. Almost 100% of my 60.000+ files. \n\nNaturally, I immediately checked the datestamps of any files accessed within the last few months, and surprisingly, there were only about 3-4 Core WP files changed. Most of my files have been untouched for years.\n\nI always took great pride in securing (WP) sites. and made sure I used the best plugins, settings, every trick of the book I knew to secure the WP /php sites.\n\nI then contacted support contact again, they tried to push nother sale on me again- again 250$.\nI wanted to dowenload my backups, but somehow I got a timeout error all the time. The told me to try again downloading the backup \" Yeah, it'll be there for you\", in a few hours  since they were \"mounting an image\".\n\nOk. I waited. A week. Tried again. Same error.

HOW WAS THE HACK MADE? Especially with all my security in place? Was  is a cross-hack from another account on the shared server?\n(15:26) [Mike] I want to speak with Technical support.\n(15:27) [Mike] Not with the sales dept.\n(15:27) [Sagar] Mike this is technical support.\n(15:27) [Mike] You sure?\n(15:28) [Sagar] Yes.\n(15:28) [Mike] Ok.

And the hackers might have hacked the account.\n(15:31) [Mike] You can check the subdirs with the security plugins yourself\n(15:31) [Sagar] I would suggest you to please dont relay just on plugin&amp;#39;s.\n(15:31) [Mike] Hackers might have hacked the account?\n(15:31) [Mike] That&amp;#39;s new\n(15:32) [Mike] I don&amp;#39;t relay too much. Just enough.\n(15:32) [Sagar] Because the plugin&amp;#39;s might be outdated or that might not have connected.\n(15:33) [Mike] Somehow that got circumvented. So you guys say.. I still didn&amp;#39;;t see any real proof of it. As far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, you&amp;#39;ve hijacked my account and ask 250 dollar to &amp;quot; fix&amp;quot; it.\n(15:34) [Sagar] I am sorry Mike ...host does not hack your accont or affect virus.\n(15:34) [Mike] so explain how 99.99% of my files appear to be &amp;quot;infected&amp;quot; but only 3 files were accessed in months/years\n(15:34) [Sagar] You can remove the malware files from third party or from your side by contacting specialist.\n(15:35) [Mike] If that doesn&amp;#39;t make you wonder, I&amp;#39;m sorry but you can&amp;#39;t call yourself &amp;quot;Tech support&amp;quot; then.\n(15:35) [Mike] Omg\n(15:35) [Mike] &amp;quot;specialist&amp;quot;\n(15:36) [Mike] Ok. one more time. I almost always hand code, use clean templates, check and doublecheck code for any strange calls,... ONLY a few CORE WP files changed.\n(15:37) [Mike] Or are you just ignorant of your customer&amp;#39;s data security?\n(15:38) [Mike] Eh. Hold on Sagar\n(15:39) [Mike] Did you just say ...host doesn&amp;#39;t affect virus?\n(15:39) [Sagar] Mike it would be better if you contact the wp secutity plugin and themes.\n(15:40) [Mike] Yeah, after I can get my bloody files, databases and settings\n(15:40) [Mike] You&amp;#39;re the host\n(15:41) [Mike] If you&amp;#39;re that uninterested in data breach, you&amp;#39;ve certainly lost me as a loyal customer.\n(15:41) [Sagar] Yes but you need to remove the affected files from your account to get the backup&amp;#39;s.\n(15:42) [Mike] Yeah right- Oh I almost forgot- comprehensive reading\n(15:42) [Mike] &amp;quot;99.99%&amp;quot; of my files are so-called &amp;quot;infected&amp;quot; by the results of your internal tool\n(15:44) [Sagar] I would recommed you to have site doctor.\n(15:44) [Sagar] Complete scan of the site and professional Removal of Viruses.\n(15:44) [Sagar] Full Backup and Restore of the site.\n(15:44) [Mike] I&amp;#39;m sure you would.\n(15:44) [Sagar] We guarantees a clean site for 30 days.

        "text": "It was around 12:30 AM, and the weather was more \"Iced Coffee\" than \"Milkshake\", but my sweet tooth needed to be satisfied. In the near distance, the illuminated sign of the mainstay Coffee/Ice Cream shop read “Open 24 Hours”, a phrase revered by late night denizens and scorned by those employed there. Two cars were ahead of me, but the line itself was started by two guys who had walked up to the window. The sole working employee, a young man in his early 20s, was doing his best to cater to this nighttime rush. As I dug for quarters to make up the requirement of the “Cash Only” sign hung in the drive-thru window, I thought about what I missed before pulling up. What did the two guys order from the window? Why was there only one employee working that night? Previous work experience had already given me the actual answers, but it passed the time coming up with more entertaining ones.\n\nA car in front of me gave up on their search for late night coffee and treats, letting their customer satisfaction show in the form of a blaring horn and some sage advice directed at the two guys.  The employee was on his phone, talking to his manager, before telling the two guys that they could pay for their things inside, a weird appeasement to the other car that was still waiting. Soon after, the other car received their order (a medium coffee and a small bag) and drove off, while I pulled up. The employee opened the window and asked again what I had ordered, visibly and verbally expressing how done he was with tonight. I wanted to tell him it was almost over with, but we would've both been lying to ourselves then. A medium chocolate shake was all, I said, exact change all ready from beforehand. “I'm giving you a large, I don't give a shit right now,” he replied, before heading off to fulfill this last request.\n\nHe returned five minutes later, milkshake in hand, and I wished him the best for the night. A couple minutes down the road, I took a sip of my long-anticipated drink. It's consistency resembled a frostbitten bowl of melted chocolate, only creamy from the mismeasurement of milk. However, it was almost symbolic of everything that occurred: A blended mix of the chocolate skin-toned employee doing his best with the icy words of his manager who was woken up before his 5 AM alarm with a phone call. In honor of the employee's commitment, I drank the rest of the shake, a testament to the fact that we all have bad days sometimes, but they don't define us.",

No big, I like salad, but I decided to go ahead and call and let them know (I was really looking forward to this dessert-it is absolutely amazing from this place). They asked if I would like my dessert brought over and I said \"yes, please, thank you so much\". I was not at all upset with them-shit happens.\n\nWhen the delivery driver came back a second time, he immediately apologized profusely and said he didn't bag 'em-just delivered. I told him it happens, no worries, you did nothing wrong, etc. Poor guy looked like he was mentally prepared for the tongue lashing of his life. I figured he dealt with viciously angry people way too often.\n\nCan we please start being nice to delivery drivers? They're doing their best and, like most other people, they don't get paid enough to deal with other people's bullshit.",

I was experiencing a particularly painful episode, and as such, was given a script by an ER doctor I work with to get filled while on duty that night (shift is 7p-7a). \n\nA few hours later, calls slowed down and my partner remarked on the side of my face being quite swollen. \n\nIt was about 2 am when we rolled into 'Not The Leading Pharmacy But One Or Two Below It', \"FloorBlue\". I walked back to the pharmacy, where there was only a pharmacist working. I handed him my script for an ear drop anesthetic and an ear drop antibiotic. \n\nPD - Pharmadick\nMe - Me\n\nPD: I can fill the antibiotic but there is no way I can fill the pain drops\n\nMe: Sure.. Why not? (My first thought was he'd say something about me being in uniform but I'd made sure they were just anesthetic and not actual opioid in origin.)\n\nPD: these drops haven't been available for some time, period. \n\nMe: oh. Okay. I had gotten some about 4 months ago, hopefully they're still good. \n\n-at this point the pharmacist becomes extremely defensive and hostile-\n\nPD: look. I said I don't have them. I can't give them to you. I'm not going to give them to you. You'll either get the antibiotics and go or leave empty handed. \n\nMe: excuse me? -slack jaw in disbelief-\n\nPD: -stands there staring-\n\nI don't know if the uniform made him feel defensive or if he was just having a bad day so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. \n\nMe: so here's the thing man. When people ask me for help I don't throw a fit and stomp my feet. I do my job. If I'm asking too much  by asking for help them just say the word. But if you want to start over and treat me like a customer instead of a drug seeker for the equivalent of topical lidocaine, let's do that. \n\nAnd he did. Turns out the drops were simply on back order from the manufacturer. Dunno why it was that hard to say. ",

        "text": "So my husband and I have been (rhymes with a word that means \"the line at which the earth's surface and the sky appear to meet\")  customers for donkey's years, they're the only carrier with good reception in my area.  But now we have a corporate account through my husband's union with unlimited data and we didn't want to disrupt it, so when I decided to get my daughter a cellphone, I just went with a standalone pay as you go monthly contract.\n\nIn the store, they attached the new number to an old Galaxy 4 handset and I purchased the $30 calls/texts plan (wifi only), but within a short time I realized that I couldn't use any location services without a data plan unless she was in wifi range, so decided to pay the extra $15 per month for 2g of data.  She's young and the security was part of the reason for getting her the phone, she's starting to ride her bike alone to friends' houses and it makes me feel safer.  Called the automated line to add the data to the plan, but at the end of the call wasn't sure that I had paid the extra $15, so I held for a customer service person.  I'm not an idiot, it just didn't seem to have given me the option to make a payment at any point in the automated process.  I had my credit card set up on the account and autopay set up already.\n\nThe lady who answered the phone seemed oddly defensive from the beginning of the call, it was so weird.  I wasn't even slightly irritated or short with her, super friendly and just wanted to make sure I had completed the process correctly.  It turned out that I had upgraded OK, but not paid the $15 extra payment (which was what I thought had happened), and she was wanting me to hang up and go back to the automated system to make the payment.  I was trying to tell her that at no point in the automated system was it offering to let me make a payment of a specific amount, nor was it telling me I needed to pay $15, because our monthly payment is not due for another 3 weeks, so if she could please just help me make the $15 payment from the card on file, we would be all set.\n\nShe kept telling me that she could pay it for me, but was warning me that \"if we give you too many credits on your account they won't do in in future\".  It took minutes to dawn on me that she meant she was offering to waive the $15 and pay it internally...why?  Why would she jump to that without me asking or even insinuating?  It was so strange and kind of funny.  I almost expected her to end by saying \"fine, fine, if you insist we'll give you a free iPhone 6 with a golden battery and two years of free service\".  \n\nI tried one more time to tell her that I just wanted her to help me make the $15 payment from my card, but no, apparently that was too hard, so she credited my account and we both hung up, perplexed as each other I suspect.",

Our store is in a small grocery shopping center, and I go to the grocery store every day for lunch.  \n\n\n\nToday I decided I wanted tuna. I grabbed it and went to the express lane. Of course the people in front of me had a cart filled with more than 15 items. They had large amounts of alcohol and snack foods. The two women pushing it were in their early 40s, with sun-fried skin, one with broken bleached hair, and the other a brunette. I heard them muttering about all the money they spend there, sounding super entitled.  \n\n\n\nThey told the woman ringing them out that they also wanted 2 bags of ice. The cashier jokingly said that would put them over the 15 item limit (I've noticed the cashiers here will call you out on having too many items, but in a joking manner so the person doesn't get angry, or they just tell them that next time they visit, to be aware it's an express lane).  \n\n\n\nAnyway, one of the snobby women snapped back at the cashier that they could just ring it up as a second transaction. They paid and headed to the ice machines while I quickly paid for my food and started to hurry back to my shop... 30 minute breaks do go by so fast.  \n\n\n\nI passed the women at the ice machine, but noticed they loaded 4 bags of ice instead of 2. I slowed my pace slightly to hear them quietly validate to each other that they deserved extra ice, because they didn't believe they should have to pay for frozen water. I debated calling them out on it, but they looked to be the type that could get physical.  \n\n\n\nI'm thinking about going back to the store tomorrow to tell a manager or something. They probably won't do anything though.  \n\n\n\n**TL;DR: Entitled women steal ice from the grocery store because they feel that paying for frozen water is ridiculous.**",

He made sure to get a receipt stating that our account was paid in full, nothing owed. \n\nFive days after we move up here, we get a \"bill\" from this company saying that we still owe $5.54.\n\nDad contacted them saying that he had a receipt printed up, saying that we didn't owe any money.\n\nOur \"bill\" was credited to us and the charge was dropped.\n\nThen they say that they owe us $0.90, but they won't send it unless we request it in writing; which would cost us $0.49 for the stamp, just to get it.\n\nOn June 1st, they send us a letter stating that dad did not turn in the equipment that he handed in himself, and that if he doesn't turn it in, we owe $500 to replace it.\n\nCalling the company yet again, Dad was connected with a person who admitted that she was outside of the United States, and claimed to be unable to locate the supposed center (that Dad visited in person) in her computer.\n\nDad's receipt is packed somewhere, so he didn't have it in his hand at the moment. When she tried to tell him that the charges were legitimate, they had a very heated discussion.\n\n&gt;Dad: \"Look, my receipt is currently in a box, but here's what's going to happen... I am going to go box by box through this house. When I find that receipt, I'm going to call [name], my lawyer, and we are going to pursue this harassment and fraudulent charge in court. I will make absolutely sure that I cost you millions of dollars in court fees as well as an insane amount of bad publicity.\"\n\nSuddenly she \"found\" the record in her own computer stating that he was \"paid in full,\" and that all equipment was turned in.\n\nWe'll see if they come after us again...",

I feel like a dick ringing the bell or waving my arms so I just stood there patiently trying to spot someone in the back and make eye contact. \n\nSomeone came out about 5 minutes later and apologized for the wait saying they didn't see me. Whateva. \n\nI wanted all the shrimp on display. No careful weighing or anything, just give me all of it whatever it weighs or costs.  He said \"sorry we close at 7\".  Well, the clock on their wall and my phone both said 5 minutes till. Plus, I thought my order was pretty easy. I don't know the complexities behind wrapping and weighing and pricing fresh meats/fish but it seems kind of simple. Maybe he already scrubbed his hands or something. \n\nNo shrimp for me. \n\nDisclaimer: I've worked restaurants for 4 years and I know the pain of someone coming in right before you are closing, especially if you've already cleaned/put away stuff that you have to get out again. However sometimes it wasn't so bad because the person just wanted an easy item that didn't make things messy. ",

        "text": "This is a story FROM a customer, ABOUT a customer. Didn't know if there was a better place for it than this. \n\nBackground to set the scene: My whole family (parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousin) were going to be off work on Monday (Memorial Day) and go to a memorial in the morning and have a picnic in the evening.  \n\nEarly in the morning, my mom is called to help out one of her clients for a while (in-home nurse) and asks my dad and I to make the potato salad for her for later. We agree and soon realize that the onions she had bought were rotted and unusable.  \nWhat good is potato salad without onion, really?  \nSo we decided to run into *Giant Everything Store* quickly. We rush through the produce, grab our one item and head to the checkout. We jump in the shortest line and notice a very pissed off looking woman in front of us and a man wearing the expression of one who is often \"wrong\" no matter what, resigned acceptance and defeat.  \nShe is whining and huffing about something and I'm hardly listening as I'm just hoping my dad won't start making fun of her to her face (he loves screwing with rude people) because she just looks like she wants a fight and we're in a hurry. I finally get the gist of her complaint, the smaller \"better\" grocery store is closed for the holiday and she had to drive \"all the way\" out here. Whatever, she's an entitled moron and I'm just trying to get out quickly when she drops this bomb.  \nEM: \"I mean, it makes sense to close for Mother's Day, because people should go spend time with their mothers. But this is like, Memorial Day! The people are dead, it's not like they're going to care if someone comes to see them or not. Why are dead people so special?!\"  \n\nI truly thought my dad was going to strangle her, he does not do well with disrespect especially since we were honoring lost family like I'm sure many people were. I was proud of him though, he restrained himself and just pointed to another line while loudly saying, \"Let's try a different line, there's something disgusting in this one.\"  \nI was also very surprised she didn't say anything back but honestly, how can anyone be that self-centered, rude, and cold? *sigh* \n\nTl:Dr \"Why are people who died defending me more important than my super important organic bananas?!\"",

But once I get to the checkout it's a 100% guarantee that I'll get stuck behind the old lady who wants to pay with a huge mayonnaise jar full of pennies, or the moron who can't work the pinpad and gives the wrong PIN over and over, or the woman who takes so long loading and unloading her shopping trolley it looks like she's doing Tai Chi or swimming through treacle. Every time.\n\nSo I'm at the train station one day with a 20 minute wait for my train. I hadn't had lunch so I thought I'd get a quick bite at one of the kiosks. In front of me in line were two slow, annoying people. Of course.\n\nThe first was a middle-aged woman who took her time deciding what she wanted, gazing indecisively at all the sandwiches and pies in the display. After a long time of this, she finally settled on a baguette or something and a coffee. Once she's ordered, suddenly she was in a hurry, having just realized that she had a train to catch. She started hopping from one foot to the other and snapping at the girl behind the counter, \"Quick! Quick quick quick! Quick quick!\" Bitch, you just took five minutes deciding which cardboard-on-stale-bread baguette you wanted. Don't start this shit.\n\nIf I thought this lady was slow and indecisive, nothing could have prepared me for the next guy. This man was pondering out loud to himself and everyone, couldn't finish a sentence, and had an extremely annoying high-pitched dopey voice. The following is a sample of his ramblings, except that he went on for longer and there might have been even more humming:\n\n\"Hmmm... I think I'll have the... *hmmmmmm*. I'm not sure... uhh... do I really want the... **HMMMmmmmm** uhhh... wait, does it come with the uhhh ***HMMMmmmhhhmmm***?\"\n\nI don't understand why people can be so indecisive about little things like this.",

Were not the kind of people to have the NEWEST, and LATEST phones. In reality my phone was well over the 2 year contract. Well we went to our nearest carriers store which is down the road from us. Our Apartment is central to everything to look into the cost of a new phone. \n\n  Me, and the wife were talking to the sales rep, and the kid was hungry you could tell the poor guys stomach was making the moans of someone who had not eaten all day. We asked him if he was alright, and needed a minute thinking maybe he needed a small break. He said he was just a little famished, and not eaten all day. This was around 7 Pm, and the store closed at 9. Well it turned out I needed some paperwork from home for us to do anything, and we lived seriously within walking distance of this place. Less than a mile. We went home real quick, and I thought hey the kid was hungry, and I work retail I know how it is not able to get a lunch break with how some places run. I grabbed a few quick snack foods a brownie, and a couple bags of chips. My wife laughed a little when I got them. \n\n  We return less than 10 minutes later with the paperwork, and we continue on with the paperwork. We give the kid the food, and I tell him I know how it is. He thanks me, and he snacks while he is setting up the contract paperwork on his computer. No not super professional, but the poor kid works in a phone company store making hardly anything, and I honestly had no issues with him eating food I brought him. He was the only guy there, and it was possible other than one or two other people that day he had seen.\n\n  Anyways time come for us to choose a new phone. Our payday is not that far off, and not much to spend on a new phone. We tell him what we have to spend on phones. He looks slightly grim, and looks over his terminal  around the store, and goes I will tell you what you all were nice to me so I will be nice to you. We have some phones that you can afford, but Since you helped me out, and brought me some food when I was hungry Let me see what I can do on my side. He started typing on his terminal for a few minutes, and actually giggled before he said well I got some good news. \n\n  He proceeds to tell me that with my upgrade credits, and using his discount abilities which was not much he could offer me 4 different phones that were top of the line within our price range. We are talking outright purchase not lease option phones. We discussed the different phones available to us, and soon chose one that was bigger, and higher memory than our old phones more than 4 generations behind. Which me, and the wife had discussed saving up for before hers bit the dust. Which would have cost us $500 bucks together.\n\n  We got the phones, and cases for them for under 100 bucks. He actually discounted us on the cases too. He even showed us how much our bill would cost monthly no change since we basically reupped our current plan which is a grandfathered plan. It is actually cheaper than if we had one of the companies newer plan. My wife, and I were amazed at how well this kid did for us just because we gave him a brownie, and some chips. Then again I remember how it is working retail. When someone treats you like a human than a retail slave it makes you want to help them to your fullest ability. ",

        "text": "Not sure I have posted in here before, but I visit frequently to read the posts.\n\n\nSo over the weekend I had a MASSIVE event for my business. I was attending my biggest yet market, and I was in a mega rush of getting stuff organised.\n\n\nAnyway, things were not going well for me in my preparation, and I was running extremely late with printing my labels, so I missed getting the files to my usual print shop (where they are printed by qualified graphic designers). For context, I send my locally-owned print shop my files, they open them all, and put them into one file, press print and its all done within 10-15 minutes. The majority of time is opening the files and selecting which ones to put into the big PDF file to print.\n\n\nSo I had to resort to going to the nation-wide Big Blue Stationery Store to get them printed, as I *thought* it would be quicker to do it that way, than to pay for ink and print it all myself on my own printer.\nNote: This place usually print them off-centre, and they look crappy, but they were what I thought was my last option.\n\n\nHow foolish I was!\n\n\nFirst, because it is a big order, I rang the store with about 90 minutes before closing, as I know how much it would suck to have a big job lobbed on you with no warning.\nI also pointed out several times that I needed the files that night.\nThey said it was fine, they had two people in the print shop, and to send it through.\nShortly after I started sending emails through (I split the files up so I could be sure the emails went through) I got an email from the store asking what I wanted done with them - I said print two of the first page, yada yada.\n\n\nThen I went to the store and waited in the line to speak to them.\n\n\nFirstly, there was only one person in the print shop (so the other one had gone home), and she was helping the customer in front of her.\nThen I heard her complaining to another staff member that the print queue was choked up.\n\n\n\"Hmmm\", thought I.\n\n\nThen after about 15 minutes of standing in the queue, one of the register folk asked if I was being helped, and I said \"I think I am the one choking up the print queue\" to which he nodded, and confirmed.\n\n\n\"Hmmmmmm\", I thought again.\n\n\nWaited for another 15 minutes, and then the other register person told me he'd been printing non-stop for an hour and couldn't do all of my printing before they closed.\nI replied, that perhaps he could have told me this earlier than an hour after I sent the files? He clearly had my contact details as he'd emailed me. I was quite ~~nice~~ calm about it, because I was so far beyond the point of being stressed, that I had no energy to make a scene, and I was appalled that I'd wasted over an hour.\n\n\nI pointed out that I HAD rung to ask if it was possible to print the files.\n\n\nSo I hung around for another 20 minutes, fuming that they'd wasted my non-existent time, but more annoyed that in front of all the other customers, told me that I'd wasted HIS time, and he'd stood there for an hour pressing 'print' on my files, and putting paper in the printer.\n\n\nHe said I could come and pick up the rest in the morning, so I gave him a death-glare and said I needed it that night, and that I **had** asked if he could do it.\n\n\nAll he could lamely reply was that he should have asked how much printing was involved before saying they could do it, and that he didn't know it was a 4 hour job. Also when he went to count my pages, I told him that there should have been xxx pages, and when I got home realised he'd royally f***ed it up anyway.\n\n \nThe punchline is that I bought a pack of ink cartridges, and printed the labels that he didn't do in 45 minutes, on my cheap home printer, again with the majority of my time spent aligning the cartridges, and keeping up with putting label paper in the printer AND I managed to print the right number of each page.\n\n\nI am now emailing my usual print shop and telling them that I love them and I will never stray again.",

A couple of feet from the bus area (where 6 buses meet, around there and take a short bathroom break and smoke) \n\nWell, I guess Mr. Driver couldn't wait to get there because right at the stop light he opens the door and got off. He walked over to a gas station. Everyone was wondering what he was doing. \n\nNow cars had to go around the bus because of where it sat. A guy went over and asked if the bus has stalled. No one knew the answer. After the new red light came on, the bus driver came back with a drink and gotten back on the bus. \n\nWhile he was gone the people on the bus phone the bus company and neither I or my Boyfriend has seen him. So he was either fired for his stupid move or he just got moved onto another bus route. \n\nI forgot to put this in, but he left his keys in the bus too. So someone could have highjacked it too.\n\nEdit. I know no one could highjack the bus. And saying I hope he's fired was a little bit rude. ",

First post here and long time lurker yadyayada- anyways I actually never posted a story on reddit before so hopefully it's not too cringy or anything but I felt like I wanted to tell this small incident that happened to me and it's halfly my wrong doing and another customers bull that probably made one cashier's life a bit harder. \n\nSo, me and my dad were out and about doing some errands when he says before we head home that we should pick up some ice cream at the grocery store. Of Course I wouldn't refuse and he gave me 10 bucks for two tubs of ice cream when he dropped me off to quickly pick some up.  \n\nNow, I don't know how this happened. Either that I grabbed the wrong brand or that they changed the 2 tubs of ice cream for 10 bucks deal with out me knowing but when I went to the cashier to pay for them, it turned out they were actually **11 bucks** and he looked at me expectantly when I have him the ten dollars.  \n\nI nearly cried and shoved in my boots as this hasn't happened to me before and I was might embarrassed for being short changed. Plus I know stuff like this rightly miffed retail workers so I feel like the worst person in the world at that moment. \n\nAfter apologizing with the most emotionally delivered speech I could give at the moment, he voided the transaction and held the ice cream so I could go out and grab the last dollar I needed from my dad. I speed walked out of there and went to the side of my dad's car and explained what happened. He handed me the dollar and I rushed back inside to see that the line grew a little. I got behind the lady that was being checked out and waited as she was being checked out and was bagging her things. \n\nNow while I was paying for my icecream, I didn't notice she also reached over and grabbed **my** ice cream and placed it in her cart before it was already too late. Thank god for retail employees as he noticed and literally booked it outside the store and confronted her about it. Soon after delivering my icecream back to me as I thanked him profusely. At that point I was mega embressed with everyone staring at the commotion and got out of there quickly as possible. \n\nMr. Cashier that had to deal with this baloney, If you found this I am terribly sorry that happened and having to deal with my mistakes.

My last stop was in the next town over from where we live, and it was just down the road from $BurgerChain that doesn't have any locations nearby me, so I decided to stop there. It had apparently been kinda slow for them, since it took a bit longer to get my food, but I didn't have anywhere I needed to be anytime soon, and being a former employee of $ChickenChain, I have more sympathy for fast food workers. So I just put my car in park and went through emails on my phone. When the lady at the window finally handed me my order, she passed along a voucher for a free one of their specialty drinks. \"Because you've had such a good attitude!\" she said cheerfully. I flashed her a big smile, said thanks, and was on my merry way. Of course, now I wonder what kind of a morning she'd had if that was her response to me just being polite...",

As the store had recently been renovated, I had no idea where they were.  Luckily, during my quest one of the store's associates met me in the aisle (we'll call him Bill).  In the middle of telling me where they are, another customer comes up and asks:\n\n\nC: \"Hey!  Where are your Christmas lights?\"\n\nBoth Bill and I looked at this guy, with equal shock and confusion. But Bill politely responded anyway.\n\nB:  \"Um...I'm sorry sir.  We don't have any Christmas lights for sale right now.\n\nC: \"What?  I though that Big Box Mart sells everything!\"\n\nB:  \"Usually we do.  But those we don't sell until...ya know...near Christmas.  Not in late May, they're out of season.\n\n*(it is at this point the yuletide customer made a face that reminded me of a small child being told Santa is not real, while eating a really sour lemon).*\n\nC:  \"That makes no sense!  You should be selling them year-round so we can get them early!\"\n\nHe spins in place and walks away in a huff.  Bill made a \"huh\"  sound and then asked me if I needed anything else.  I replied no, and thanked him for his help.  I did see the other guy as I checked out; he shot me a dirty look from the cashier two lanes over.  \n\npeople are strange.",

        "text": "Back on May 9th, my mother lost her home in a tornado. Nobody but the animals were home at the time and when the fire men arrived they had found all four dogs. They were alive and well. But, her two cats were missing. We worked for hours that night looking through debris, hoping to find any salvageable moments. Finally, around midnight, we found Jace,one of her older cats.\n\nNow we are down to finding Elby, the last missing animal. It's about 3am and my mother and I are climbing through unstable beams and broken marble and exposed wires when I hear my step father yelling, \"I've got him! Hurry! He's in bad shape!\"\n\nElby had been inside the house at the time the tornado hit the house and took him up in with it. Elby was obviously in shock, his eyes were so swollen and packed with dirt, we weren't sure he still had his eyes. His breathing was labored. There was no question. He had to go to the ER vet ASAP. \n\nMy husband and I load up and drive an hour into Norman and find the closest 24hr vet. The nurse rushes him in and they begin working on him. I speak with the receptionist about payment and get some arrangements made as it was obvious he would be staying overnight at the least.\n\nThe sweetest Vet comes out and explains Elby's condition. Corneal abrasions (possible lots of eyesight) and traumatic brain injury. He's in bad shape, but she feels she can get him back to mostly normal. She allows us back to snuggle him before leaving the clinic at to rest and recover. She showed us an estimate of a two day stay for our injured animal. Almost $900. We told her money isn't an object. There has been too much lost today. As long as he will recover without living a horrible life, do anything you need to do. The vet hugs us and we head to a friend's house to catch some zzz's seeing as we had driven in from East Texas. \n\nI call at 7:30 the next morning for an update. He's improving, but it'll take awhile and the vet's office is the best place for him to be.\n\nThen, the incredible happened. This receptionist begins asking me about where the tornado was. Where the cat was found. Just some odd questions. Then she said, \"Don't worry about Elby. We have him and are taking care of him. Forget the cost. We are taking care of it.\" Elby ended up having to stay for 4 1/2 days. The vet refused any money from my mom and step father. It was the most touching and selfless thing they could do\n\nThe cat has retained his eyesight and his motor functions are improving daily. \n\nThese things restore my faith in love and caring for others. So thank you to all of those that help others when they are down. You have no idea how something that seems small to you can make all the difference in the world to someone else. \n\n\nThe kitty is ok! https://imgur.com/xt8snRD\n\nDavis, OK Tornado from May 9, 2016 -This is - was my mother's house. https://imgur.com/gallery/8xb8F",

I stop and start to wait, the bus driver gets out because the child getting off is disabled and I assume he's going to do something to get the elevator prepped, but instead he starts walking towards my car.  I look at the bus and I can see some other older lady in the bus giving me the stink eye.  The bus driver comes up and starts straight up screaming at me that \"YOU NEED TO BE 10 FEET AWAY FROM THIS BUS WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT, HOW DARE YOU ENDANGER THESE KIDS, THE KID HAS A MENTAL DISABILITY, I'M NOT MOVING THIS BUS UNTIL YOU BACK YOUR CAR UP 10 FEET\"\n\nnow I'm no architect but I think I can estimate 10 feet give or take.  At the worst I was probably 9 feet away, there was a large gap enough to fit 4 or 5 kids holding hands.  I explain that to him, I tell him that unless he can go back there and get all 20-30 cars behind me to backup too, I'm not going anywhere.  He huffs and puffs and walks away to continue helping the disabled kid out, and he's talking with their parents, and telling them how much of an ass I am in clear hearing of this kid, me, and probably the kids on the bus. He then talked about how some guy screamed at him the other day, and he doesn't understand why people are so rude to him.  (news flash buddy, if everyones rude to you, you're probably rude too).  He says goodbye to the people, then peers over at me, and leans on the bus staring at me. I say \"you gonna go?\" and he says \"back up\".  I realized this guy wasn't going to play around, and there were no cops there, the children were all well away from the stop, so I just drove forward and ignored the stop sign.  I could see him in my rearview approaching another car who was about to do the same.\n\nHow can someone working around children be this much of a cock",

His mom didn't understand this, though that is basically the same policy anywhere that sells DVDs/CDs. \n\nCustomer service was cool about it and apologized for the trouble. Before she was even able to say \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\", his mom was telling her that she's crazy, don't mess with her, she's going to \"tell social media\" about how *Store* won't give us our money back. I thought she was going to press a button to call security actually. My boyfriend and I just smiled and told her that we'd read the policy and it wasn't a problem (really, it wasn't) and went to the back to get another DVD set, his mom was gone when we got back (she was telling people in the DVD area about how \"corrupt\" the store is. \n\nThe C.S. lady was talking to her manager and when we rounded the corner, she pointed to us and stood behind her manager. Of course we apologized profusely and told her and her manager that everything was ok, we didn't share the same feelings as his mom about this and again, apologized. \n\n**World: customer service isn't responsible for making the rules.

The tops of the '1' and '0' were torn, but so long as I kept the other coupons as the missing piece, I thought I was in the clear.\n\nThe cashier didn't see it that way.

This chain offers a free birthday entree, so I arranged all of us to eat dinner together so I would not eat alone.\n\nWhen my mother and I arrived, I stood at the host desk and waited and waited and *waited* while three employees chatted nearby. The hostess then walked up, apologized, and placed me on the waiting list: ten to fifteen minutes. I could see empty tables in the dining room, and a party of four had jumped ship already rather than wait any longer, but we waited.\n\nAfter we were seated, no one came to our table. Finally, a man who I assume was the floor manager, who was not dressed in the chain's typical outfit, asked if we had had our drink orders taken. No, we had not, so he took them, and I think he randomly chose a waitress off of the floor to wait on us.\n\nOur waitress was pleasant and attentive *when she was at our table*, but after waiting for a very long time for our food to come, I glanced around the dining room for her and noticed most of her tables were far away from ours. I mentioned to my mother that maybe she had forgotten about us. She looked over at us and finally came over to tell us we would be waiting just a little bit longer for our food. Well, thanks.\n\nShe finally brought us our food. Or, I should say, she stepped up to our table while *another* server brought us our food. My mother had ordered broccoli, and our server said the broccoli on the line was cold, so she would bring my mother a new helping. Why, yes, I am sure it *was* cold, just as my food was not that hot. I wonder why?\n\nThis chain offers endless helpings of sides. Our server did take our orders for seconds of sides. She did bring those promptly. But after my mother finished eating her broccoli and decided she would like a helping of another type of side, and I asked if I could have a third helping of that side, too, the server said all of that side had been served, and more was cooking. No big deal! We can wait. I like spending time with my youngest nephew, anyway. He was the best part of the night.\n\nWe waited. We waited. We waited and waited and waited. No food came. No server came. I wanted my ticket rung up a certain way because of the chain's frequent diner program, but because the server was taking so long, my brother and sister-in-law began to ring up our orders on the tabletop gizmo. I wanted myself rung up with my mother and my oldest nephew, but the frequent diner identifications were not entered correctly, so instead of using *my* identification for a ticket of three, my identification was used for my meal only, which made my birthday meal free, and my mother's identification was used for her meal and my nephew's.\n\nI was two *paid* meals away from getting a free meal, but because the waitress was so slow coming back, and my brother and sister-in-law were getting impatient, I lost out on my free meal. To make matters worse, the tabletop gizmo did not print out a receipt for my brother and sister-in-law. So they had to wait, anyway.\n\nMy mother never got her second side. I never got my third. Funny how they advertise endless sides. Good luck getting past seconds.\n\nI came home and closed my frequent diner account. After my mother gets her free birthday meal later this year, I will close hers, and we will not eat at that chain anymore.",

        "text": "A while back we were traveling to the major metro area in the southern end of our state. That area has a chain of popular restaurants that serve an unusual combination of breakfast and dinner foods. \n\nWe showed up around 12:15 on a Friday afternoon and put my wife's name on the waiting list. They're known for being busy so we started wandering over to the far side of the waiting area, where there was still some shade. While we're walking over, with at least 6 groups in front of us, we hear, \"J, party of 3.\" I'm convinced it must be someone else, but my wife asks the employee calling it and he says it's us. Well, ok then.\n\nWe shuffle in behind the other groups that were called (3 or 4 seem to get called at once) and end up last in line. The hostess takes the group ahead of us and disappears for 5 minutes. When she finally gets back she seems confused by our presence. We explain that our party was called, but there seems to be confusion. Before we can offer to go back outside to sort it out she says \"follow me\" and leads us to a table.\n\nFor the next 15 minutes we sit there. No one comes by. We grab a server and explain that we'd like to order and are rudely told, \"someone will be there in a minute.\" A few minutes later still nothing but I manage to grab the eye of the manager. He comes over and lays on the charm, takes our order, and apologizes for the mistake. By this time people who were sat around the same time have their food and have been checked on by other servers.\n\nOur \"turkey and pancakes\" are dropped unceremoniously about the time all the tables around us (who were sat after us) are paying their checks. No one checks on us. No one takes our plates. We finish eating and push our plates to the side, I do everything I can to get anyone's attention. Several times we stop passing servers and bussers asking for the check, but it never appears. The manager, who I can see running around the other part of the restaurant, seems to have a knack for not looking in my direction when I notice him (several times I notice him as he finishes surveying my section and is moving on.)\n\nEventually we go back to the host stand and explain to the same woman who sat us that we're trying to pay our check but no one will bring it to us. She asks who our server was. \"I don't think we have one. The manager took our order.\" She disappears for a while and eventually comes back with a check that seems accurate. We hand her a card and she says, \"would you like to leave a tip?\"\n\nLet this moment hang in the air for a minute, because several things enter my mind. I didn't really receive any service here. The manager, who can't keep any tips anyway, took our order. Except for the runner, who spent maybe 30 seconds carrying us plates, none of the other staff actually helped us. It's almost 2pm, and we'd been inside that restaurant for over an hour and a half at that point (for a place that normally takes 30-40 minutes.) My wife and I look at each other, and kinda grimace.\n\n&gt; Well, normally we would but we didn't actually get any service...\n\nTo her credit, the hostess gave me a very sympathetic look.\n\n&gt; That's ok, I wouldn't know who the tip is supposed to go to anyway.\n\nAnd with that, she ran my card, thanked us for coming in, and we wandered off to visit the local theme park.\n\nThe punchline came on Sunday, when we were driving home. While stuck in traffic and flipping through radio stations we happened to hear a news story.\n\n&gt; And in local news a Southern &lt;state&gt; restaurant has run into trouble. Jefferson's Turkey and Pancakes filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last Friday. ",

I pointed out that it was an express lane and I had far more than 12 items (my trolley wasn't full but it definitely more than 12)  She told me to go there anyway, I was not happy about it because I just knew some jerk was going to give me a hard time for this.\n\nAnyway, almost finished loading my things onto the belt and a man lines up behind me with a basket.  I hear him sighing loudly while I grab my last few items.  I look at him and he asks if I can count because I clearly have more than 12 items.\n\nI snapped at him, mainly because I was feeling defensive \"I was sent here because there were no checkouts open, if you have a problem waiting, fuck off to the self check.\"\n\nHe looked stunned for moment but stayed where he was, much more quietly this time.  I can't help but feel rather pissy at the employee for sending me to express!  I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN!",

        "text": "Okay, this just happened tonight, and I'm still pretty outraged about it and need to rant a little bit.\n\nMy fiancé, a friend of ours, and I were enjoying a pleasant evening playing mini-golf and catching up. Afterwards, we decided to swing by the drive thru for some grub. My fiancé and our friend placed two separate orders. The first order (our friend's) went splendidly without any issue. However, my fiancé's was less than pleasant.\n\nMy fiancé got paid yesterday, so he only had larger bills on him, which left him having to pay with a $50 bill. We noticed after cashing his check at the bank the day prior that this particular $50 looked different and took a glance at the print date. We saw it was from 1977, didn't think anything of it, and forgot about it. That, is until we tried using it the next day.\n\nWe handed the cashier the money, she glanced at it for a moment, shut the window, and walked away. After waiting for 5-10 minutes, a different employee came to the window, and asked us what we were waiting on. We told her we were still waiting for our change and the rest of our food.\n\nThe cashier came back a few minutes later, and told us she couldn't accept the bill. We asked her why, and she told us it was obviously a counterfeit. We responded by telling her that didn't make any sense because we had just gotten that bill from the bank the day before. It was at this point she started laughing in our faces, accusing us of using a counterfeit $50 bill, refusing to give us the bill back, and then threatening to call the cops on us. She only agreed to give it back to us after we offered to pay with a different $50 that she accepted without any problem.\n\nWe later took that same $50 bill, that was supposedly a counterfeit, and paid with it at a big-name retail store. My fiancé used to work at one of these stores himself, so he knows how to properly identify counterfeit money, and knows other employees know how to check for that as well, since they have to deal with larger bills all the time. They were able to verify that it was, in fact, a legitimate $50 bill.\n\nNeedless to say, we were very livid at how rude the cashier in the drive thru was towards us. It's not even that she wouldn't accept the bill. It's the fact that she spent 10 minutes arguing with us, laughed in our face like we were incompetent idiots, refused to give us our $50 bill back that my fiancé worked his ass off for, and then threatened to call the cops on us. Even if it had been a fake, she handled that situation extremely poorly. It was by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced.",

Let's call him Tom. He was nice enough but seemed a little \"off.\"\n\nThe delivery service uses text communication, so the delivery guy gets my number when I order and I get his when he calls to say he's on his way. So one evening, I get my food and pay as usual. Nothing out of the ordinary until I wake up to a text message from Tom. \n\nExcept it's not just a text message; it's a video. He sent me a clip of him with an extremely weird snapchat filter over his face which made his skin looked cracked and blacked out his eyes, and the whole thing is just 3 seconds of him licking his lips, and then it ends.\n\nNaturally I'm incredibly creeped out and immediately report him to the delivery service. They took my complaint very seriously and contacted Tom on my behalf. They told me it was all a huge misunderstanding and Tom meant to send the video to a friend, not me, and he's very sorry about it. Whatever, I let it slide.\n\nTo make things more awkward, I keep getting him as my delivery guy a few more times after the incident. But I just pay and leave without small talk. No incidents until one other night.\n\nI order soup, chips, and a baguette from Schmanera Fred for delivery. Total is about $15 or so. Tom comes with my food and all I have is a $20. I ask for $2 back so I can tip him the rest. All of a sudden he gets super awkward when I ask for change, and pretends to look through his wallet, and I can clearly see at least a couple dollar bills sticking out. \nMe: \"I just need $2. Do you have $2?\" (I know he does)\nTom: \"Uhhhhh.......no. I don't think so.\"\nThen he has the nerve to point to some construction guys working outside my apartment and says, \"You should ask them and see if they have any change.\" \nUm, what the actual fuck dude. I can see the $1 bills in your wallet. There's no way in hell I'm asking complete strangers to break my $20 when you're required to have change on you.\n\nI'm so mad at this point I just think \"fuck it\" and give him the $20. I get to my place, open my bag, and there's a cup of soup, no chips, no baguette. I paid $20 for a cup of fucking soup.\n\nNow I'm literally seeing red. I complain to the delivery company again, clearly pissed off in my email, and they were just like \"Oh whoops, it must have been just a big misunderstanding again, here's $2 off your next order.\" \n\nI never saw Tom again.",

Since my roommate was busy on her laptop, I got up, checked the peep hole, and opened the door to get the pizza.\n\n&gt;Me while signing the slip: Thank you for delivering it.\n\n&gt;Pizza guy: You're welcome. Do you stay here alone?\n\nMy roommate immediately stops typing and listens.\n\n&gt;Me: Uh, no. I live with my husband. Have a good night.\n\nI closed the door and immediately locked it. The guy was literally at least 40, and we both felt very uncomfortable. We didn't call the manager to complain, because we have before on a delivery driver who dropped our chicken bites on the ground, and nothing really was done about it.

        "text": "I live along a mountain pass corridor NE of Seattle. It's a nice, quiet, country place that sees a lot of tourists pass through it. Most of them are just as nice as can be. This tale is not about one of them.\n\nHusband and I are at our favorite local restaurant. It's a small place (~15 tables), and the staff there work their butts off. The owner is from Vietnam and makes food in the style of his village as well as traditional American food. It's freaking delicious and very different from all the pho places around that seem to use the same basic recipe. The waiter is the nicest in the Valley, and he always remembers the locals' orders and banters with them. I love this place, and we eat there 3-4 times a month.\n\nToday, we were there waiting on our food, when this absolute bitch tourist came in. As she enters, she asked for a menu; that part is totally fine. As the waiter gives her one, she says in a voice loud enough to reach the back of the restaurant (this is slightly paraphrased because I wasn't writing it down), \"I have to check your menu because out here the people aren't very sophisticated so you'd have to cater to their tastes. In Seattle and San Francisco, you know, they have a much more diverse population.\"\n\nShe continued for 2-3 minutes going on and on about the lack of sophistication (she really like that word) of the townsfolk and menu, how much better things were in the city, and how she didn't think she could find anything that would suit her taste.\n\nEventually she and her companion decided that they could eat hamburgers, and they ordered. She continued to yammer in the same vein for another few minutes. \n\nWhen my food arrived, I thanked the waiter and told him (loudly) how much my backwoods, unsophisticated palate was looking forward to my delicious lunch. My husband told me to be quiet, but I was pretty pissed off.\n\nShe then switched to complaining about me to her companion (who barely said two words the entire time - she talked NON-STOP barely pausing to breathe).\n\nBy contrast, there was a very nice couple from Seattle (I think) that sat at the counter, interacted happily with the waiter, and tried all of the Vietnamese specialties that the waiter recommended. They seemed pretty darn sophisticated themselves, but they didn't seem to need to announce the fact to the restaurant or put down the local residents or the restaurant's food. \n\nThe waiter was very polite to the bitch tourist the entire time. He's a super nice guy, and he's always smiling, so I wasn't surprised that he would treat well even such a raging bitch, but I just wish he didn't have to put up with that.\n\nWhat kind of person goes into a small town just to insult the residents and then bash a restaurant's food before even tasting it?",

And some other Jesus things that have nothing to do with anything.\n\nMy boyfriend just smiled politely and said nothing but I (being the argumentative bitch I am) referenced the various assaults committed in bathrooms by cisgendered people and asked what \"Jesus\" (airquotes lol) had to say about that. She said nothing, stuck the pin in the fabric and my boyfriend pulled me out of there.\n\nStill in shock, not sure if I handled that appropriately but my god....",

I have a small CC with a tiny limit on it to build my non-existent credit since I pay for everything I buy. So I figured I'd just put it on my CC instead of my debit for the sake of using the CC. Apparently I put more on there between my vacation and grocery shopping than I thought so it came back as declined. Seriously though the limit is like $200. \n\nWithout a second thought after I had read the declined message with my own eyeballs because I'm not an oblivious customer the cashier just loudly bursts \"MA'AM IT SAYS YOUR CARD IS DECLINED FOR INSUFFICIENT FUNDS!\"\n\nWell way to be discrete lady. Paid with my debit and went on my way. It was still awkward for her to just shout that out for everyone to hear. What if I actually didn't have the funds and had to do the walk of shame. ",

While in most cases I wouldn't consider these to be amusing enough to post here, one that happened about a month ago certainly was.\n\nHe went to pick up a smaller pizza chain. I made the order about half an hour before, and was given as estimate of 24 minutes (it was just two pizzas, and before the lunch rush). Everything was paid for, he just had to pick it up. I didn't see the conversation happen, but after it he came back and I got to hear the rant about the 'horrific service.' \n\nThis is how the conversation happened as I understand it. The conversation happened between the Customer, Pizza place cashier, and eventually, a Manager.\n\n----------------\n\nC: *Opens the first pizza box and looks frustrated*\n\nP: Sir, is everything alright?\n\nC: This isn't what I ordered. This isn't what anyone orders.\n\nP: Well, if we offer it, I'm sure someone had bought it. What did we get wrong?\n\nC: Is this a Tombstone pizza?\n\nP: ...\n\nP: We don't offer frozen pizza. We can cook you another one if you like?\n\nC: I don't want a new pizza. I want a good explanation.\n\nAt this point, a Manager saw what was going on and decided to step in.\n\nM: *Calling from about ten feet away waling towards P.* Sir, is there something I can help you with?\n\nC: Does this place serve frozen pizza, cooked and then passed off as [pizza place name]'s pizza?\n\nM: No, we would never do that. If there's a problem with your pizza we can-\n\nC: Then the hell is this? *Shows him the pizza*\n\nM: *Sigh* Aside from the topping choice, that looks like just about every thin crust pizza we have ever sold.\n\nM: *Taking no crap and holding up a menu* As you can see, it looks exactly like the picture of the pizza in the menu.\n\nC: It looks like a tombstone pizza as well.\n\nM: *Pulls out phone, and shows C the Tombstone pizza* No, it really doesn't.\n\nC: Well, maybe you... *Trails off and leaves pizza place.*\n\nI had a long conversation with him explaining why he overreacted. And no, it was not a Tombstone pizza. It was actually the best pizza I've had from this place, although it may have been hunger speaking.\n\nC had mentioned the pizza place cashier by name. The next day I saw that she was working, and bought a $2 bottle of soda and gave a $10 tip. I apologized on behalf of my... friend... and she helped me figure out a few pieces of the conversation. As it turns out, she found it more amusing than insulting. It made her week a lot less mundane.",

I'd had a bit of a shit time because I'd spent every day running around with a stupid heavy back pack on and while I got to go to a few shows I also spent most of the time either staring at a computer screen, or being shouted at for not running fast enough while carrying heavy equipment etc.\n\nAnyway so my boss and I had different flights back to the UK, and he decided I was going to take his insanely heavy trunk full of incredibly expensive and heavy lenses. I'm only a relatively small (and pretty weak) girl and I could not physically lift this thing, so I told him repeatedly that I would be charged as there was no way this was within the weight limit. He told me it would be fine, and I wouldn't need any money, and didn't give me any. \n\nGot to the airport, and yep, it exceeded the baggage allowance. I was instructed to go to the desk to pay the extra, by which time I was really panicking as all I had on me was my UK debit card which I was pretty sure wouldn't work. It was only about $30 but I didn't even have that. Got to the desk and there was a young woman there. I said I only had my English card, she pointed to the card machine and I tried it, didn't work. I started flapping a bit and really panicking and she whispered 'look at me' so i did and she mouthed 'its fine', then pretended to take a transaction, gave me a receipt. I couldn't thank her enough honestly she was an absolute angel. Restored my faith in humanity (which had only recently been lost from working with *that man*.)\n\nI'm one to panic quite a lot so I know in hindsight it all would have been fine anyway but I was more worried about being caught with a bag that wasn't even mine. Airports are scary!\n\nps. I definitely do not work for him anymore",

I then asked them to ship it for me.\n\nShipping would cost me $315.  More than the value of the desk.  I wasn't going to pay that price for shipping so I told them that I no longer wanted the desk.  They then told me that there was a restocking fee.  The restocking fee was $36.73 on the $166.95 item.  Which is also, unacceptable.\n\nWhile in the store I contacted my credit union and processed a charge back for the full amount.  I made sure that I did so in front of the manager on speaker phone.  I like my credit union, they don't question charge backs.  They also made sure to note that this isn't the first time that my credit union has done a charge back for *this specific furniture store*.\n\n*This specific furniture store* will *never* get any of my business again.  *This specific furniture store* will find it hard to keep customers if they are forced to do charge backs over things like this.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago and me and my wife just bought a new house. We were looking around for a new kitchen and i don't know how it is in other countries , but here in the Netherlands it always feels a bit shady. In most stores, when a kitchen is priced at 14,000, you can always bargain it closer to 8,000. I always feel like, no matter what price you get, you still pay way too much. Just give me a realistic price and be done with it.\n\nSo we already went to a few stores and were getting kind of tired of this tactic. We entered this store and started looking around for kitchens, found something we really liked and start talking with the man working there. We were the only customers in the store.\nWe told him our experiences from other stores and he was real accommodating and agreeable...\n\n..and starting doing the same thing. \n\nKM = Kitchen man\nME = me\n\n&gt; KM: This will cost you about 14,000, but just today i can get it down to 10,000 for you. \n\n&gt; Me: That's still too high, and i don't really feel comfortable bargaining like this.\n.. This is the condensed version. it actually took us a few minutes and me and my wife were getting a bit frustrated.\n\n&gt;KM: You know what, i'll go call my boss. I really like you and i want to help you.\n\nSo the man walks away before we can stop him (besides yelling), me and my wife look at each other and we decide to go to another store. We didn't want to just leave so we waited around till the man came back. That took about 5 minutes. \n\n&gt; KM: So i talked to my boss...\n\n&gt; Me: Listen, i'm sorry, but as we said before we don't feel comfortable doing business like this, so we're going to another store.\n\nAt this time the man stops being friendly.\n\n&gt; KM: WHAT? Are you kidding me? I spent the last hour (it was closer to 30 minutes) on you, and now you just walk away? \nARE YOU SERIOUS? \n\n&gt; Me: I'm sorry, but there's no need to start yelling.\n\n&gt; KM: You can't do this. I already talked to my boss. I have a great offer for you.\n\n&gt; Me: i'm sorry, but we don't feel comfortable doing this.\n\n&gt; KM: GET OUT OF MY STORE\n\n&gt; Me: Have a nice day\n\nLater we went to a different store that actually had 'real' prices where we got the same kitchen for 6,000 and where we actually saw the price breakdown. \n\nFurther explanation: In the Netherlands, when you buy a house and you don't like how your kitchen looks - or if it's old, there are special stores where you can buy everything (counter top, appliances, cupboards, sink, etc)",

        "text": "Setup.  I live a 5 minute walk from a well known fast food restaurant.  Pizza had been ordered and was on the way, but the kids wanted something from there, so they're at home with their mother while I take a walk down to get 2 meals for them.  The weather is really warm, and the traffic coming out of the tourist parts of the town is almost gridlocked.  This place is heaving both in terms of the drive thru, and the queue that is out of the door.\n\nThe tale.\n\n\nAfter ten minutes in the queue (it felt like 20) I finally get served by a young girl who looks like she's only recently removed the word \"trainee\" from her badge.   Also, she looks rather pained, clutching one hand across her belly as if she has cramps or something.  There's a \"not quite with it\" look on her face, and it's really warm inside.\n\nI ask for a kids Hamburger meal and confirm the drink, then say these exact words.\n\n&gt;Wait.  On that kids meal I just ordered, can you make it no onion and no pickle please.\n\nShe asks me again what the drink is, and then I order a double cheesburger with no onion or pickle, a medium fries and another medium drink, because my daughter is awkward when it comes to her food.\n\n&gt;So that's a cheeseburger kids meal with no pickle or onion, with orange, double cheesburger no pickle or onion, medium fries and medium orange.\n\nShe got it wrong, and my son doesn't like cheese so I can't exactly just suck it up.\n\nI correct her for the Hamburger, and again she confirms the drink.  She reads back everything to me correctly.\n\nAnd now the fun begins.  As the drive-through is packed, and the counter is packed, everyone is rushing.  My default in these circumstances is to check that the order is correct when it arrives, rather than to just assume.  Especially as the burgers are specials.  Another ten minutes passes, and then she presents me with my order.\n\n&gt;That's a cheeseburger kids meal with orange, and no onion, Hamburger kids meal with orange and no pickle, double cheeseburger, medium fries and medium orange.\n\nAt this point, I could have been a little more polite I suppose, but my dinner had arrived (I received a photo of it ready to be eaten as I was waiting) and I'm hangry.\n\n&gt;No.  I asked for a hamburger kids meal, no onion or pickle.  Not 2 kids meals, just the 1.\n\n&gt;I've got down 2 kids meals...\n\nand she proceeds to read back her mangled order.\n\n&gt;Look, that's not what I ordered.  I ordered 1 kids meal, 1 burger, 1 fries and 1 drink.\n\nThe did not / did too went on for 2 or three attempts, before her manager intervened, and she went outside.\n\nHe couldn't have been nicer, and apologized on her behalf and for the long wait (apparently they were short staffed as the good weather had taken them by surprise), refunded me the entire order for the mix up, remade the burgers and made fresh fries for me.\n\nI hope that the poor girl doesn't get any kind of disciplinary action because of it, and I don't hold any animosity against her, but if she's not feeling well for any reason, perhaps working on the counter of a fast food restaurant is not the best idea.\n\ntl;dr: Server gets food order completely wrong despite reading it back to me correctly (eventually)\n\nedit: remove all references to the restaurant brand.",
