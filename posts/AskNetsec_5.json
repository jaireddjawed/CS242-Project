Outside of state governments coordinating with factories at the production level and stuff like that, there’s, on average, a very low chance that someone could take a new iPhone, think iPhone XR when the iPhone box was wrapped in plastic shrink wrap, infect it with a virus or tracking software or something when it is still in the welcome / setup mode at the beginning when you register for an Apple ID and all of that, have it still be in the welcome mode, and then put the phone back in the box and then wrap it in shrink wrap again to make it look new? \n\nI know a crazy scenario but I just wanted to know. I’m sure anything is possible technically but wanted to know thoughts. I know iPhones are generally secure I just wanted to know. Thank you!!!",

It's pretty straight forward, but there is one part we cant agree on how to interpret the requirements.\n\nThey mention 'Network Devices' in a few of the Requirements. Such as \"Patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in operating systems of workstations, servers and *network devices* are applied within one month of release.\"\n\nWe are split in our thinking. In this context, are Network Devices:\n\n1. Every device 'plugged' into the network. Servers, end user devices, Printers, IOT....\n2. Network Infrastructure devices ie. Switches, Routers, Firewalls, Access Points.\n\nThanks for any assistance you can provide.",

They also didn’t log out &amp; didn’t change my password.\n\nNow I’m wondering; what do hackers gain from this? My account doesn’t have my full name, no pics, and only 3 friends. So I’m doubtful someone targeted me specifically. So what do professional hackers gain from this then? And how do they find the accounts to target? \n\nI’ve checked whether my email is pwned and it wasn’t. Also I did have an easy password (but not a general one like abc123 or something, but no numbers or capital letters or symbols), and no 2FA (on all my emails and my other social media I do, but because I barely use Facebook I haven’t bothered to set it up and make a hard password until yesterday).",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/zqx1u1/project_proposal_for_me_to_go_back_to_school/",
        "text": "To start, I am 26 years old and would like to go back to school for a Master's in Cyber Security with the company's tuition reimbursement program. I would not spend a dime out of my own pocket. To get this approved, the company said I needed to write a project proposal for them.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Good enough to hit send?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Dear \\[Company Name\\],  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am writing to propose that I return to school to pursue a Master's degree in Cyber Security. I believe that this investment in my education will have significant benefits for both myself and the company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Obtaining a Master's degree in Cyber Security will give me a comprehensive understanding of the latest technologies and best practices in the field. This will make me a valuable asset to the company as I will be able to better protect our systems and data from cyber threats. With a Master's degree, I will also be better equipped to lead and train other team members on how to identify and prevent cyber attacks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition to the benefits to my personal and professional development, obtaining a Master's degree in Cyber Security will also have numerous benefits for the company. First and foremost, it will help the company stay ahead of the curve in terms of cybersecurity. As the threat landscape constantly evolves, it is important for the company to have highly skilled professionals who can anticipate and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. According to a recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime is expected to cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021 ([https://www.cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-costs/](https://www.cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-costs/)). By investing in my education, the company will be investing in its own future security.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Additionally, having a Master's degree in Cyber Security can also help the company attract and retain top talent. In today's competitive job market, professionals with advanced degrees in specialized fields are highly sought after. According to a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, 82% of employers said they prefer job candidates with a Master's degree ([https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/pages/masters-degree-preferred-by-employers.aspx](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/pages/masters-degree-preferred-by-employers.aspx)). By supporting my pursuit of a Master's degree, the company can demonstrate its commitment to investing in the professional development of its employees and provide a strong selling point to potential job candidates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Finally, obtaining a Master's degree in Cyber Security can also enhance the company's reputation and credibility in the industry. Customers and clients are increasingly concerned about the security of their data and are more likely to do business with companies that have a proven track record of protecting it. According to a report by IBM, 60% of consumers would stop doing business with a company after a data breach ([https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach)). By having a team member with a Master's degree in Cyber Security, the company can demonstrate its expertise and commitment to security, which may lead to increased business opportunities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I recognize that returning to school is a significant commitment, both in terms of time and money. However, I believe that the long-term benefits for both myself and the company make it a worthwhile investment. I hope that the company will consider this proposal and support me in taking the first steps towards advancing my career and strengthening the company's cybersecurity posture.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sincerely, \\[Me\\]",
