        "text": "Somebody told me to drop this here, so here I go! I hope you all enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it.\n\nPart 1\nOhh boy, this was the end of the campaign so there's a decent amount of backstory leading up to that moment but I'm happy to tell the tale. Let's see what twists you guys can guess before they happen.\n\nFirst things first, if you haven't ever played a fantasy flight Star Wars game they have these backgrounds that you use during character creation to sort of ease your way into the character. 5E does this a bit too. I always liked working with the DM on this kind of thing and he rolled for mine. I got vengeance for one motivation and family for the other. Then I decided I wanted to be a Rebellion Sharpshooter named Jax but my home world was Naboo, making him one of the Palace guardsmen. He was also an orphan, adopted by a wealthy family but they didn't see eye to eye (I promise this is relevant). The backstory we came up with together was that my character had, earlier in his life before the rise of the Empire, become romantically involved with a Jedi, Vera, who had been posted on Naboo in a diplomatic position (Jedi not following their code, so original I know, I know). Any who, she gets orders to deploy elsewhere along with her master, Silara. While away she realizes she's pregnant, has the child in secret and this is all done with her master's oversight and approval. Jax doesn't know about the child, and Vera doesn't return for a little over two years. When she finally does return, it is right after Order 66 has been initiated and the clone troopers are turning on the Jedi. Silara, Vera, and a few clone commandos that refused to obey Order 66 arrive on Naboo under cover of night to try and gather some friends they have there, my character Jax included. Unfortunately, Imperial clone troopers arrive about the same time hunting them. In the battle confusion Jax gets separated from Vera and the commandos but makes his way to their awaiting ship and agrees to work with them. They wait as long as they can but are forced to leave before Vera or the commandos make it back to the ship. (I wrote, into my backstory at this point, that Vera is dead. I've added what actually happened because it makes telling the story way easier). Vera ends up being captured by bounty hunters, one mandalorian female and an IG-88 Assassin droid, to be delivered to the Empire. The two bounty hunters have a bit of a disagreement on that note and the mandalorian ends up beating the Droid up and wiping his memory banks. Then she sold Vera and the Droid to an old CIS general who happens to be a droid that is very unhappy with how the Clone Wars turned out. Jax and Silara meet up with their small group of rebels on a moon way out in the BFE of space. There Silara introduces him to his child, only she doesn't bring that bit up (She's full of secrets). Silara tells him that her name is Miranda, that she is force sensitive, and he needs to take care of her.\n\nOkay, so, now we actually started playing the game. Cut to a further 16 or so years. The Galactic Empire is messing stuff up, Yavin IV and the first Death Star just happened (Episode 4). \n\nJax and a now 17-year-old Miranda are out running a quick errand when their ship gets shot down over a desert planet (can't remember which one but it wasn't Jakku or Tatooine so it doesn't matter). The walk through the desert and eventually find a town not too far away. Making their way to the nearest Cantina they happen upon too bounty hunters, an IG-88 assassin Droid named L0-GN and a trandoshan named Taz'Dingo (yes). Taz and L0 get into a bit of a scuffle with some local gangsters but Jax overhears that the two of them have a ship. Jax gives them some fire support and in exchange the two bounty hunters give Jax and Miranda a lift back to their little moon base. When they get there the commander of the base Ash, Jax's CO from Naboo, offers the two bounty hunters some work killing local imperials. They agree and Jax and Miranda are tasked to go with them and help them out. A new medic, Kit, is also assigned to the team. They run wet ops against Imperials for a while before the small band of rebels makes the decision to join the actual Rebel Alliance after the Battle of Hoth. \n\nOne evening a strange distress signal is picked up, Imperial in origin, and our heroes are sent to investigate. By this time, they have decided that their Firespray Gunship has the Name \"Star Wolf\" and everyone constantly groans about it except for L0-GN since it was his idea and it is his ship. The distress signal ends up being a derelict Star Destroyer. The team boards the ship and finds it almost completely empty. Slowly, just like the horror movies, the team discovers that the crew have all turned into undead monstrosities and they set the Star Destroyer's core to detonate. Star Wolf manages to escape with all hands but is has their hyperspace thrown of course in the resulting explosion. The arrive at a strange destination, a single space station with a very strong tractor beam that pulls them in.\n\nInside the station they find lots of old ships, some even from before the clone wars. All are empty. The station seems empty but the team moves towards the center hoping they will find some type of control room. Since the facility is so large they split up (always a great idea!) and Jax and Kit go toward the holding cells. L0-GN and Taz go to what they believe to be the bridge. (It's important to note here that Miranda is not present, she training to be a Jedi with Silara). In the holding cells Jax and Kit come upon a robed character in a cell with ray shields all around it. Jax asks the figure who they are. The figure says something like, \"You first,\" and Jax fails his skill check to recognize the voice. He explains that he is a Rebellion trooper, lost in space, and wondering what this station is. The figure stands slowly, lowers her hood and turns around. Standing before Jax is Vera, still alive after all those years (despite being written into his backstory as dead. Blew my fucking mind at the time to be honest). Jax decides that he will do anything to get her out of the cell and walks to the bridge guns drawn.\n\nOn the bridge L0-GN is have a crazy realization. You see, L0-GN has memory loss problems. He did not know his maker or his purpose leading up to this point. He just killed people, because he figured that's why he had guns for arms. There on the bridge, that all changed. A Droid stands before L0-GN like he has never seen before and explains that he is L0-GN's maker. He is also an old CIS General and a pretty angry dude. About this time Jax breaks onto the bridge and demands Vera be released. The CIS General isn't big on that, given that he thinks the Jedi are the reason he lost the war. He's kept her in holding there as a sort of payback. He is also planning on waging war on the galaxy using an army of droids like nobody has ever seen, not even the CIS. L0-GN, with some of his memory back, realizes that he cannot let that happen. You see, L0-GN always had a soft spot for organics and for the rights of all types of people to choose their own way in life. He thinks the CIS General will be just another Emperor and won’t allow it. Using some incredibly lucky persuasion rolls he actually talks the CIS General down, convinces him to free Vera, and lets us leave on Star Wolf. The party, not wishing to try the General's patience, get up on the ship and leave with the only fanfare being L0-GN's order of, \"No Fuckin' on meh ship,\" to Jax and Vera. As they head into hyperspace Vera turns to Jax and says something like, \"How's our daughter?\" to which Jax goes, \"What?\" and she says, \"Miranda...\" and cue an entire party of minds blown (except Jax and the DM which actually made it a bit funnier).\n",

        "text": "Short summary of first session [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/4npjaf/my_first_session_subverting_all_my_expectations/).\n\nSo for my very first campaign, four adventurers are investigating a string of unusually far-reaching orc raids, culminating in defeating a small group of drunken raiders and their handler in the ruins of a farming village, including seducing one of their number into joining the party.\n\nSo the group now consists of:  \n\n* Torvald Silver-string, DMPC TN Human Bard/healbot  \n* Thorn, omnisexual CN Half-orc Barbarian  \n* Silva Rosus, CG Elf Ranger  \n* Aisen, NE Human Sorceress  \n* Targok, DMPC Orc Barbarian and now boyfriend of Thorn\n\nThis week began with our party resting up just outside what's left of the town, the players discussing in-character what to do next. Targok was little to no help, being of 8 INT and 5 WIS and preferring to show off his rock collection, so they ended up deciding to just go ahead and investigate.\n\nThey arrived at the ruins of Redrock Shanty a couple hours before sunset, finding nothing but rubble and ash. While poking arund in the ruins, they came across a trapdoor - when Thorn elected to open it, he was promptly struck right in the nose with a broom handle, held by a very angry dwarf (\"YE'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE, YE PELT-WEARING CABBAGES\")\n\nAfter a brief conversation, now tasked with recovering a small child, the group headed into the mines, almost immediately spotted by a kobold scout. Further in, they were confronted by the leader of the kobolds, as well as his bodyguards.\n\nNow, the leader here was a 7th-level Sorceror, accompanied by a pair of 4th-level rogues. I'd fully kitted them out for providing a challenging combat encounter, accompanied by an unspecified number of lesser kobolds with a couple class levels. Given how effortless the previous encounter was, I wanted to really make them sweat this week.\n\nThanks to Targok and Thorn taking point with their racial darkvision, the boss assumed they were part of the raiding group, and asked why they'd returned so soon. Aisen, in an impressive display of rolls and roleplay, managed to convince the boss to contribute some of his subordinates to the raiding effort, including one of the rogues. No big deal, I can still make this a challenge.\n\nAisen then continues to casually weasel information out of the boss, ending with convincing him to give them a progress report on the mining operation they'd established in the day the'd been there. This was where the players first learned that Gundrok Fire-Heart, the half-dragon orc warlord who they'd learned of in the previous session, was basically a messiah sent by Tiamat, according to the kobolds in his service.\n\nAs soon as the tour reached the room where the mined ore was being sorted and processed, Aisen casually sauntered over to the two kobolds working at the ore pile, while the remainder of the party stayed behind with the boss and guard - with a remark that the boss should really start doing background checks, she Color Sprayed the working 'bolds, putting them out of commission, and the rest of the party took a surprise round to jump the leader and guard.\n\nNow, two interesting things happened in this surprise round. First, Silva attempted to shank the boss, but rolled a natural 1 - I ruled that he tripped and fell flat on his face.\n\n*Then*, after the other party members took their turns, the guard being exactly 2 HP off death, Torvald rolled to attack the guard - he managed to roll a nat20, but due to his pitiful STR score of 6, *failed to do any damage whatsoever*. In an effort to salvage the crit, I ruled that he tripped over the prone Silva and his dagger flew up out of his hands, arcing into the air, then made another attack roll for the falling dagger.\n\nThe dagger thudded straight into the guard's neck, neatly severing his spinal cord as it dealt exactly enough damage to kill him.\n\nAisen finished off the boss on the following turn with a Scorching Ray, and I rolled a Listen check for the other kobolds in the mine to hear his pained screech as he died.\n\nMy second ever natural 20.\n\nWhat followed was a rather hectic battle with the party being attacked by kobolds from three different directions, with more approaching every round. In the interest of saving time, after they racked up a good number of kills I had the remaining 'bolds flee the mine in fear, and ended combat.\n\nThe party briefly split up here, with Silva heading deeper into the mine in an effort to track down the lost child, while Aisen and Thorn headed down a different corridor to find the kobolds' barracks. Here, they met Thakak - elderly troglodyte cleric of Tiamat.\n\nCue plot dump via interrogation: Gundrok is the divinely-touched champion of both Tiamat, Mother of Dragons, and Mauloch, Father of Outcasts. On the day of his coming of age, he defeated the chief of his tribe in single combat, and as he struck the final blow great golden wings sprung from his back, and every orc present felt in their very bones that he was Something More. From there, he began his efforts to control the orc tribes, the goblins, the kobolds and the troglodytes, to \"unite the downtrodden races of Rackan, and carve out a kingdom by blood and steel, that we may prosper and grow freely.\" Thakak commented that that hardly sounded like Tiamat's style, but far be it from him to question the Grand Mother.\n\nParting with him on amicable terms, Aisen left him with one last request - to pass on a message to Gundrok that she may consider allying herself with him in the future, should he prove worth the effort.\n\nMeanwhile, Silva navigated a maze of twisting, roughly carved tunnels to find the dwarven child, a girl by the name of Marta, clutching a stone pulsing with a soft red glow. After being ambushed by the shambling corpse of the girl's father (and losing half his health in a single blow), he managed to escape with the girl, who was returned to her mother, and the dwarves invited the party to stay the night.\n\nSo now the party has acquired information about Gundrok, a magic ring that allows the wearer to see a short distance in obscuring weather, and a strange stone pulsing with arcane energy, reacting only to the touch of the dwarven child and Aisen. My players are discussing amongst themselves where to go next, and our characters have reached level 6.\n\nDMing is really goddamn fun.",

        "text": "It’s 2074, and corporations run the world. Invisible, Inc. is the spy agency that’s fighting back.  That is, they were, until their HQ went and got blown up. Now they have just a few days to beam into corporate offices around the world and get the resources they need to go back into hiding and continue the fight, or end up in a cubicle-shaped cell. Or coffin. \n\nThe only agents left are Internationale, a redheaded Cuban hacker, and Banks, a dark-haired Irish lockpicker, now beamed in to a quiet office and ready to extract some crucial information from the brain of a corporate executive who's made the unlucky decision to work late.\n\nOn the move. Quiet. Too quiet. Then: a large courtyard, divided by a long screen providing only one way to squeeze through.  Internationale slides through, and finds herself directly behind the unsuspecting executive himself. That was easy. She swiftly stuns him, then starts to pull him behind the screen when — at the very opposite end of the office, a patrol spots her. She vanishes behind the screen, the limp body of the exec in tow.  Banks quickly circles around without being detected to the other side of the small gap and takes out the guard when he comes through.  \n\nThey wait, bopping another two guards over the head as they come through to investigate, while HQ takes its sweet time rifling through the target’s brains. Done at last — time to dart over and grab the memory chip with the info, then make a run for it through the banks of offices to the east. They manage to dodge the patrols, and move deeper into the eastern offices, into what looks like a small hospital room, and then into an even tinier room on the left. \n\nWhere there’s no escape. Just a couple of safes, no way out except the huge, patrolled room they just came out of, and absolutely no idea where in the hell the teleporter is that will get them out of this godforsaken place. \n\nInternationale swiftly cracks and loots the safes before making a break for it, managing to dodge one of the patrols and squeeze out into more open ground with easy cover. But Banks isn’t able to follow her (unless she wants to get shot). Both spies wedge themselves into corners, hoping to escape notice, but there’s a guard who’s decided to investigate the racket in the safe room. \n\nThe other guards, though, are distracted by Internationale’s escape, and end up scattered around the facility trying to hunt her down even as Internationale has finally managed to escape their notice long enough to move into the quiet, unpatrolled bank of offices to the north. And there, finally: the teleportation hub that will take her and the crucial memory chip to safety. It’d be so easy.\n\nBut Banks is still alive! Although by now the Security Level is high enough that her location just got broadcast to every guard in the place, she’s managed to take out the remaining guard who scurried into the safe room, and is using the distraction to slide along the walls until she’s on the eastern end of the northern offices. Just has to make it across to the western end. Making a split-second judgement call, Internationale turns away from the teleporter and hits up the nanofabricator, ordering it to print her a rifle with the funds she stole from the safe room.\n\nDamn. Just two bullets. It’ll have to do. \n\nShe runs towards Banks’ location, shoots the guard who’s just over Banks’ shoulder, and the two finally meet again, just as two more guards at the other end of the huge courtyard spot her through the doorway. Blast! She never did close that door behind her. Internationale quickly ducks into the small office where Banks is holed up, and Banks tasers one agent as he runs in behind her moments after. Internationale bravely steps back into the hallway, in full sight of the final agent, and blasts him with the last bullet she has.\n\nAt this point, the entire building is on the highest alert, Security Level 6. The teleporter behind Banks gives a whine as two more elite guards pop in.  By now both of their locations are being broadcast to every guard in the place, and it’s time to get gone. Banks sprints towards safety and finally makes it into the teleporter.  Internationale lags, encumbered by the hefty rifle and unable to run, but finally makes it, enforcers hot on her heels but memory chip in hand, both of them gloriously alive, alive, alive. \n\nAnd this is only the second mission. \n\nNext up: the memory chip doesn't just contain info — it's a key. Time to see exactly what kind of riches are behind the door that key unlocks…if they can get to it. \n\nFor those of you interested, [Invisible Inc.](https://www.kleientertainment.com/games/invisible-inc) might have come out a year ago, but it continues to provide some unbelievably tense thrills!  Definitely keep an eye out for it during the Summer Steam Sale.",

        "text": "I have been a gamer since I remember, and now in my early 30’s, for the past few years, I found myself getting bored of games very quickly. From AAA’s to indie games I’d mostly end up playing them just so I can beat them and be done with them so I could move on to the next title, like ticking chores off a list, and quite often not even bother finishing the game at all (I’m sorry The Divinity, you were one of the better games I played recently!)\n\nI’d known about the Soul games for years, but had been hesitant to even try them for fear of frustration and boredom from their infamous difficult gameplay and the countless deaths phenomena. Until a few months ago I saw an interesting video that delved deep into the Soul games’ sense of exploration, and the rewarding factor of the games - something I truly realised later on when I played the games - so i decided to pick up Dark Souls 3 upon its release a couple of months ago. After countless hours of frustration and deaths (as expected), I realised I must be doing something wrong; I may not be a real hardcore gamer, but surely I can’t be that bad? That’s when I decided to read up on the games mechanics, stats system, guides on how to play as a noob, what starter class to pick, guides on parrying and so on and on and on. So I started a new game, picked up a knight and started to play _properly_. Never have I ever found myself so immersed in a game in  such a long long time. I invested so much time in the game, not only by playing, but also reading up about every bit of the game - something that I’d barely and rarely done with any game before, unless it was a little walkthrough through some section of some game I was stuck at or some such. I studied the maps and made sure I missed not a single item. I read up on all different NPC’s and quest lines to make sure I’d make the most of the play-through, something I realised later wasn’t possible to achieve in just one play-through. So not so shockingly, I started the NG+ once I beat the game so I can achieve 100% achievement completion: an idea that I would’ve laughed off at in any previous games that I’d played. “Who gives a damn about achievements?\"\n\nNonetheless, I loved this game so much I bought the kickstarter board game and the other 2 Soul games in the series, which I’m yet to play because I ended up buying a PS4 (that came with Uncharted4) just so I can play Bloodborne. Yes, I’m really that much affected (read: obsessed) by these games. And Bloodborne: what an utterly  gorgeous game. It’d probably come as to no surprise at this rate to say that I even ordered the game’s guidebook, to save myself from countless amounts of internet checking (which I still do anyway!). I could write a long post about how amazing this game is but I’ll save that for another time!\n\nSo thank you again FromSoftware for making some of the most amazing games in all my years of gaming experience, and bringing back the joys of gaming again to this bored-no-more adult gamer. My wallet may hate your guts, but I love you.\n\nTL;DR: Been getting bored of games fairly quickly in the last few years and didn’t seem to have much attention span for most. Then bought Dark Souls 3 when it came out as my first ever Souls game in the series, got massively hooked and felt the real joys of gaming again. Bought the other 2 as well as a PS4 so I could play Bloodborne and now I’m a complete addict!",

As he sat himself down at the counter the dwarf bartender came up to him;  \n\n-\"What'll it be, lad?\"  \n\nHe asked for some milk of the goat. With a chuckle, the bartender handed him a glass. The tavern only had three other patrons, a common elf with a shadowy purring figure and a cowled dark elf in one corner, and a fidgety salamanderman in the other.   \n\nAs he sipped on his glass the door suddenly flung open. A dwarf bearing an axe and shield at his side walked in. As he made his way to the bar the cowled elf brushed past him and sat himself down next to the salamanderman.\n\n-\"Ho there, brother. Good mead is hard to find around these parts, how much for a tankard?\" asked the dwarf.\n\n-\"One coin for you, my brother.\" answered the bartender, as he poured the mead.\n\nThe dwarf reached for his belt and grabbed at thin air. He looked around the tavern floor for his gold pouch.\n\n-\"Barzul! Me gold's gone! I'm sorry brother, I cannot pay for your mead, here, take it back.\"\n\n-\"Then it is on the house! I will not let it be known that I denied an honest dwarf his mead for mere coin!\"\n\nThe dwarf thanked him and eyed the dark elf until he saw the other.\n\n-\"Elmor my friend! We meet again!\", the elf smiled.\n\n-\"Norik! Come, sit by me, what have you been doing since our trek through the woods?\"\n\nWhile they chatted the bartender noticed smoke coming from the other corner and called;\n\n-\"Oi, you there, what're you doin'?\"\n\nThe salamanderman didn't answer, but the smoke continued rising, so the bartender grabbed a krug of water and rushed over to pour it over the hand of the salamander lying on the table.\n\nThe salamander, startled, yanked his hand back and was in the process of (probably) stammering an apology, the dark elf leaned over to the barkeep and softly muttered;\n\n-\"I apologize for my friend here, I believe these will be enough compensation.\"\n\nWhile he handed the barkeep the coins from the dwarf's stolen purse the barkeep looked at the singed handprint and walked away without complaint. The salamander thanked the dark elf.\n\n-\"Don't worry about the dwarves, a little coin and they'll happily bugger off of your sight.\"\n\nDuring all this, Praenun the wizard who had overheard the conversation between the elf and dwarf in the opposite corner went over to their table and asked;\n\n-\"Hello there, I hear you know your way through the forest, would you be willing to guide me through?\"\n\nJust as Elmor the Elf was about to accept, he caught the stare of the dark elf and said;\n\n-\"We'll see, we can talk about it with my companion -\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a deafening boom accompanied by a sizeable quake. The salamander sprang to his feet, glass in hand, and threw himself at the door to see what was going on outside, and shouted back;\n\n-\"Soldiers!\"\n\nThe dwarf slammed the side of his axe on the table and exclaimed;\n\n-\"I know a warhorn when I hear one THERE'S FIGHTIN TO BE HAD!\" and he joined the salamander's side by the door.\n\nPraenun was not so sure, since he was rather certain he had heard the sound of a Noisebridge, a device used to open pathways to the other planes, pathways big enough for entire hosts, and he quickly pulled out his \"Compendium of the Angelic and Demonic Realms - Fifth Edition\".\n\nAs he flipped through the pages Elmor hopped over Norik to see what was coming.\n\nOut of nowhere, the salamander pushed Norik into the street, and the dwarf, confused, called;\n\n-\"Well? Aren't you all going to FIGHT?\"\n\nAll the commotion drew the attention of about seven of the soldiers who then broke off from the force marching through the main street into the alley where the tavern was.\n\nIt was then that Praenun called to Elmor;\n\n-\"Quickly, tell me what they look like!\"\n\n-\"Ugly!\"\n\nPraenun was not quite satisfied with the answer, but at least it ruled out the angelic side of possibilities. In desperation he asked the salamander;\n\n-\"What colour are they?\"\n\nVisibly annoyed by the simplicity of the question, the salamander shot back;\n\n-\"White-ish, I guess!\"\n\nThat narrowed it down to two candidates, either:\n\nThe mostly solitary skeletal demons, and the more hierarchical ice-demons, judging by the sheer number of them (and the fact that the city was still stood), Praenun came to the conclusion that it was the ice-demons they were about to face. While he read through all the helpful information about them, (their castes and their capabilities, how to identify each caste etc.) the dark elf, whose name was Gildor, climbed onto the roof of the tavern, noiselessly for the most part and surveyed the area from his vantage point.\n\nWhat he saw was an entire army of bluish-white  men wielding spears marching from the central district outward. And a ten metre-high construct of living ice that accompanied them.\n\n-\"We need to get out of here, and fast.\" he thought to himself, not willing to just leave his friend Elmor behind.\n\nHowever, he also saw that the seven soldiers were the more pressing issue at the moment and got ready to strike from the shadows.\n\nMeanwhile, back on the ground Norik had his own plan he'd like to call: Axe to skull. Elegant in its simplicity perhaps, but not the most terribly foolproof plan, if anything. He turned to Elmor and said;\n\n-\"Right or left?\"\n\n-\"Right\" answered Elmor, as he raised his bow and took aim.\n\n-\"Right then!\" growled Norik, and hurled himself onto the closest ice-soldier, and Elmor took his shot.\n\nTwo heads were pierced practically simultaneously; One by axe and other by dart.\n\nNot everyone was so keen on fighting though, and so the salamander ran further into the alley, looking for an escape path. Alas, such was not the will of fate and he found himself in a dead end with the entrance to a small brewery on one side, and a tailor on the other. He tried to get into the brewery, but the door was locked, and so, he turned back to the ongoing skirmish and did what he thought was best; hurling a fireball without much thought of those who stood between the ice-demons and him.\n\nPraenun saw the gout of flame pass by the door mere seconds before he himself finally joined the fray. The agile Gildor, not one to miss his opportunity, fell upon the demon furthest back, driving his rapier deep into its neck, and succintly rolled out of the way.\n\nThe fireball hit two targets. Unfortunately one of them being the once bushy beard of our dwarf, Norik.\n\nAs Norik tried to quench the flame consuming his beard, Praenun attempted to charm one of the demons. While he succeeded, unable to handle the metaphysical backlash, the spell was wiped from his mind.\n\nThe charm worked better than any of them could imagine. The affected demon promptly turned and stuck his comrade with his spear. While this wasn't enough to kill him, in his confusion he could not even counter properly and only managed to put a scratch on his charmed peer's carapace.\n\nSeeing his opportunity, Elmor loosed another shot, this time at the wounded ice-demon. Unfortunately, instead of lodging itself firmly in its head, the arrow flew straight past him and at Gildor, who was standing a short distance behind.\n\nNoticing the arrow at the last second, Gildor launched himself to the side. While he did dodge the arrow, he hadn't realized that he had his back turned to a merchant's stall laden with many pots and pans.\n\nGildor cursed as he heard a resounding GONG from behind him, thinking that he had drawn attention to himself. Luckily for him, between a roaring dwarf launching one of their comrades five metres through the air and another suddenly turning on them, they had their hands too full to care about some noise.\n\nDriven partly by frustration, Elmor let loose another shot, but this time Gildor was ready for it, and he snatched the arrow out of mid-air. Elmor, heavily annoyed to have missed yet again, decided to find a more favourable shooting position higher up, and so he deftly climbed onto the roof of the brewery across the tavern.\n\nWith only two hostiles remaining, Norik, who had finally managed to put out his beard (though not without considerable loss. He would later find out that his beard would never again be the same), he attempted to finish off the foe closest to him. Alas, while his swing did connect, his axe just bounced off of the creature's armoured carapace.\n\nHowever, its icy body had no defence against the fiery missile fired upon it by our wizard, Praenun, and subsequently melted away. Norik, taking heart from this, once again tried to cleave through the last remaining hostile demon in one mighty swing, but it was not to be. Perhaps from the shock of losing most of his beard, he swung at the thin air right in front of the demon, who was then put out of his misery by his only remaining comrade, the victim of the charm. \n\nRealizing that the only thing to do now was to relieve the poor demon from his service, Gildor swiftly stuck him in the back with his rapier and proceeded to climb back on the roof to see if they were about to receive any more company. He was then caught between two emotions; relief that no one appeared to be interested in their little back alley, and dread that the colossus of ice was now much closer, and with a new quarry. A three metre high figure with four arms and a greataxe, which of course for him was what Norik's axe would be to a full-grown man, was riding on its shoulder.\n\nHe then noticed the riders the golem was following. Of the three horses, two were beset by knights in full plate, and the third had two passengers; Another knight, this time with a golden trim to his armour and a small cloaked figure. Gildor then processed this information.\n\nIt was obvious that the riders were the target, and that an attempt to outrun them to the main gate would be absurd.\n\nSeeing the two elves on the roof, Norik thought it a prudent move to join them, since there weren't many places he could go to from his where he was, so he pulled out a length rope with a hook at the end of it from his pack and hurled it up. He then clambered onto the roof, a decision he would come to regret later that day.\n\nNot wanting to be left alone in an alley with no safe exit, Praenun quickly followed Norik up his rope, well, at least for a short while. After a single pull upwards his arms gave way and he fell flat on his back. During all this, the ice lord pulled a chunk of ice about the size of an average cauldron and launched it towards his target, the knight in gold and the cloaked figure. \n\nThough it wasn't a direct hit, it was enough to unbalance and topple their steed. The other two knights promptly dismounted and assumed a defensive formation around them. However, instead of rushing at them, the small battalion of icy soldiers kept their pace and moved towards the alleys on both sides of the main street.\n\nThis was what pushed the salamander to sprint across the street and into the closest alley, and kept running until he hit a dead end once again, this time in front of a moderately opulent house. With a handful of the soldiers at his back, he knew he needed to take cover of some sort, so he smashed in a window, climbed in, and prepared a fireball in his hand. \n\nThe poor soldiers didn't know what hit them.\n\nWhile all this was happening, Praenun started to panick. The elves and the dwarf were on the roof and the salamander standing at the mouth of the alley had disappeared as well. Unable to think, he went back into the tavern, only to come face to face (Well, belt to face) with the barkeep, now clad head to toe in half-plate and holding a mighty warhammer.\n\n-\"Follow me, lad!\" he said, and Praenun happily complied.\n\nThe barkeep led him to the brewery and unlocked its door.\n\n-\"Through 'ere.\" said the barkeep, as he led Praenun to an unremarkable door further into the brewery.\n\nWhen he opened to door, Praenun let out a sigh in relief and surprise when he saw that it led to a tunnel.\n\n-\"How far does it go?\" he asked.\n\n-\"Til outside the walls. Right past the ditch.\"\n\nWith the barkeep up front Praenun was overjoyed to have found a way out. He felt a pang of guilt when he thought about the others, but quickly turned his attention back to the matter at hand.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the ice lord saw the tree figures running about on the roof and uncaringly hurled another block of ice at them before proceeding to drop his axe onto the ground and calmly follow it himself.\nThe unlucky target of the icy boulder was Norik, whose reaction was to throw himself on the roof and hold his shield behind him. Unfortunately for him the block crashed squarely into him with enough force to knock off the tip of a mountain, but Norik was a stout dwarf, and he endured.\n\n\nThe razor sharp splinters flew in all directions, including the ones Gildor and Elmor were. Though Gildor dodged them with finesse, Elmor wasn't as prepared, but thanks to Norik absorbing most of the impact, the shards didn't have much force behind them when they reached Elmor.\n\nAfter his \"rider\" got off, the golem kept moving until it reached and intersection, and sat down, effectively blocking the path to the nearest exit to the city.\n\nThe knight in gold and the icy lord stared each other down, but neither took a step forward or backward, and the ice lord's axe still stuck out of the road from where it had been dropped.\n\nNoticing that their escape would be made rather difficult by the gigantic golem, the trio decided to find another way out of the city. To that end, they thought about crossing the street and going through the alley the salamander had previously run into, the problem was that there was a three metre tall ice lord in the way...\n\nAnd so, a plan was formed. Gildor would sneak behind the ice lord while Elmor distracted him with an arrow and backstab him with his poisoned blade, Norik would then hurl himself off the roof and bring down his axe with the might and fury only a dwarf can.\n\nOh how it all went so wrong...\n\nIt began as planned with Elmor looseing a shot at the ice lord's head and successfully drew his attention, even if the arrow did just plink off his helmet. In hindsight, that should have raised some flags right then and there, but it didn't. The distraction was enough for Gildor to get behind him. And so did Gildor lunge, and watched in horror and disbelief as his rapier simply slid across the back of the ice lord, not even leaving a scratch. And then the ice lord turned around.\n\nWhile Gildor was contemplating the roughly five hundred years he had spent on this earth, the ice lord grabbed his axe. If it weren't for the knight in gold's sudden action Gildor's part in this story would have come to its end. Instead the ice lord deflected the knight's blow.\n\nOn that cue, Norik leapt from the roof,.. and landed about two metres away from his target. He then considered his options; Charge at the three metre tall ice lord or run past him as fast as he can. He opted for the latter, though his sprint could well have been interpreted otherwise, which is probably why the ice lord raised his axe in guard instead of slicing through him. The knight took the cloaked figure by the arm and swung it at the dwarf;\n\n-\"Take her with you!\"\n\nNorik instinctively grabbed her arm and yelled;\n\n-\"Run lass, run!\" though it was more of an unintelligible bellow because of the blood in his mouth due to his injuries.\n\nGildor understandably also joined them in the run from the most immediate danger, accompanied by one of the non-gilded knights. The other unfortunately was crushed by the golem on its way past. Speaking of which....\n\nWhen the ice lord lifted his axe, the golem hefted his arms and brought them crashing down, which leads us back to our wizard Praenun, who was still in the tunnels. The force of the golem's swing collapsed said tunnel right as he was being led by the barkeep. As luck would have it, they were right underneath the golem's arms, and thus the tunnel collapsed right onto the poor barkeep, killing him instantly. Praenun, shocked, looked to see if he could perhaps dislodge the rubble with the barkeep's warhammer, until he realized that even that was stuck too firmly to move. After taking a couple seconds thinking if he could (slowly) clear away the rubble with his magic missiles, he turned back towards the brewery. He was met with an unpleasant surprise on his arrival; He saw the blurry figures of eight icy-soldiers from the window, slowly moving through the alley, probably slower than they normally would after seeing the corpses of several of their comrades.\n\nNeeding to buy some time, Praenun stuck his head out and conjured a simple illusion in front of the tavern, but only succeeded in drawing two of them away, the remaining six moved forward. He backed up into the room and looked around, hoping to find something to use against them.\n\nMeanwhile, after seeing how their plan had not quite worked the way they wanted, Elmor, still on the roof, went back towards the alley, hoping to find the wizard they had left behind, arriving just in time to see him peek out the door and cast his illusion. Elmor assumed a spot with good line of sight and waited. He saw that two soldiers each were going tailor and the brewery respectively, with the last two standing guard at the exit to the dead end. During which time the wizard started considering setting the whole building aflame. After weighing the possible dis- and advantages (namely possibly getting stuck in the tunnel he would take refuge in) he made that plan B and shot a small ball of flame at the first soldier in front of the door.\n",

Me as a romantic bard,  a grappler monk wrestler type of character,  a halfling barbarian with height issues,  and a halforc cleric were tasked with finding a lich.  To get there,  we were given choices for paths,  and one of those was taking some canoes down some rapids. \n\n Obviously we took this over the forest trek and boring mountain climb.  When we got there,  we find the place is a hot-spot for a local tribe of centaurs,  who actually take the kayaks down the rapid,  wielding double axes,  in a sort of aquatic gladiatorial arena.  \n\nThe wrestler was ecstatic.  Long story short  we ended up participating in a battle on kayaks down a river fighting some centaurs with double axes.  I used dissonant whispers to make one centaur jump off his canoe into his aquatic death,  wrestler speared another out of his,  halfling went insane on the other... Was fun.",

She talks to the stablekeeper and turns out he is pretty friendly. She stops and reads her sheet for ~20sec in silence. She then points her arm forward and yells\n\"Look! A Three-eyed-rat!!\" We all burst out laughing due to the hilarity of the scene, she then procedes to roll the d20. And I shit you not, it was a 20.\n\nAs the hysterical laughing stops, the DM then narrates the mass comotion that her yelling caused. People started looking from their windows searching for the damn rat, people started fighting with eachother on the streets wanting to get a better view at the mutant rat. Bottles starts to fly, children cry, all because of the possible sight of a three eyed rat.\n\nShe grabs the charriot easily and we all hop in. At the end of the session, as we return the next day to the city after completing our assignment, we see posters on the walls warning us citizens about the three-eyed-rat, we hear rumors of a creature that caused mass hysteria early that day, we have bounties offered to us if we capture the beast.\n\nDude, this three eyed rat became an instant meme in our table. Not a single session goes by without the legendary three eyed rat being mentioned by a PC or a NPC.\nThought this was a cool story and wanted to share with you guys. Please feel free to share your stories as well. These are the moments that make dnd so great.\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading!\n\ntldr: terrible bluff move becomes legend in a 5000 people city",

        "text": "Well, my friends wanted me to write up some more of our random misadventures in our first ever campaign so here is another. This happens a few sessions after my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4o5df4/dd_5e_how_we_discovered_our_dragon_sorceress_was/).\n\n**The Party:**\n\nAlton the Halfling Assassin\n\nCorvo the Drow Arcane Trickster\n\nLyria the Half-Elven Ranger\n\nAliella the Half-Elven Dragon Sorceress\n\nKraigon the Human Barbarian\n\nFredrick the Human Bard (my character)\n\nSarlax the Dragonborn Paladin (A mysterious DMPC tagging along for questionable reasons)\n\n***\n\nThis tale starts off with our party having infiltrated a flying castle in use by a cult of Tiamat. We had just finished killing one of the cult leaders, a Black Half-Dragon with an evil looking enchanted sword.\n\nThe battle had been annoying since it had taken place in a cramped hallway with acid flying everywhere. However, we managed to get through it only bloody and bruised except for Corvo who had been incapped.\n\nNot wanting to sit around and wait for more cultists to ambush us we tried to get Corvo back on his feet so we could be on our way. \n\nThe problem was we couldn't.\n\nFor some reason we couldn't get Corvo back above the negative. He wasn't dead, but all methods of healing just seemed to fizzle out when used on him. Now, I don't mean to mess with him, but Corvo's player had a habit of rolling horribly on anything but dex saves. He would have to roll death saves, or be DEAD dead. With no means for us to revive him. Miles above the ground. In a hostile enemy castle. Needless to say we panicked.\n\nAlton quickly thought to check the room the half-dragon had come out of for clues. Antidotes, scrolls, or anything else that could help or let us know what we were dealing with.\n\nSo Alton and I burst into the nicely decorated bedroom and see a ornate chest on the opposite side. He started to rush over to check it... and the rug he stepped on leaped up and engulfed him. Shocked I ran up and started trying to kill the rug, screaming at it to spit him out. Alton managed to wrest himself free from it's grasp and we both sliced the thing to ribbons. \n\nMaking sure there were no more rugs to slay, Alton ran over to the chest and attempted to unlock it. He was immediately pricked on the finger by a needle and dropped to the floor after being poisoned. I quickly healed him, cured the poison, then buffed him with cat's grace and bardic inspiration and told him to OPEN THAT CHEST.\n\nLight and nimble Alton knocked all the tumblers into place, through open the lid and we found.... nothing. The chest was completely empty.\n\nFilled with frustration, I ran out to check on the others while Alton slumped to the floor. I was greeted by Kraigon and Aliella shouting random phrases at the evil sword in a variety of nefarious sounding languages.\n\nObviously confused I tried to figure out what was going on. Aliella apparently had sensed a mischievous spirit in the blade, and hoped to ask it what the heck was going on.They tried Dwarvish, Draconic, Elvish, and Abyssal but had no luck of getting anything out of the sword. The DM let us know a minute had passed since the fight, making us fear we didn't have much time before the cult would be at our throats.\n\nFrustrated at the swords insolence Kraigon resorted to his go to method of solving problems. Violence and intimidation.\n\nHe grabbed the sword and ran off to a nearby balcony we had noticed while traversing the castle. He held the sword over the edge, glared at it, and in common yelled \"What the hell did you do to my friend!?\" as though that would work.\n\nThe most surprising thing is it did.\n\nIn a snide voice the blade replied that he was merely a tool for his wielder and only had done what he was designed to do. Kraigon, glad to finally be getting somewhere, asked him how to reverse the effect.\nWith a chuckle the sword let him know it would disappear \"In due time\".\n\n Kraigon stared at the blade in annoyance, \"How long?\"\n\nThe sword happily replied, \"About a minute.\"\n\nBy the time Kraigon had gotten back and told us the news Corvo had already stabilized himself.\n\nWe weren't even halfway through the castle...\n\nDid I mention this all happened because Alton decided to knock on a locked door?",

        "text": "My friends and I just started a Pathfinder campaign, and I wanted to give a rundown of the first two sessions\n\n**Cast**\nElron- Elf Wizard, my friend's first foray into Roleplaying and doing a surprisingly good job (considering he has to deal with us). A bit of a history buff, and was kicked out of Barnum and Bailey's Magic College\nOrryn Sweetcakes- Halfing Cleric, somehow Lawful Good, despite being a smidge murderhobo on his mother's side. Rolls for EVERYTHING from actual checks to standard conversations. Lost his family (literally) and fell into fanatical worship of the sun\nDavias- Half-Elf Rogue, rolls diplomacy or bluff for almost every conversation, and has more often than not talked us into trouble than out of it. Was betrayed by previous employers and wants to do good\nPheonix Jones (Me)- Human Monk, private investigator who lets his fists do the talking, and is main damage dealer purely due to lucky rolls. His brother was crossbowed down while walking the beat, and he seeks justice\n\nOur story begins like any story, with our four heroes in a tavern. While we're enjoting our drinks, three heavily armed men walk in asking the barkeep for all the money he owes them. Three of us, Orryn excluded, began moving around to try and trip these guys up. Elron, ino order to distract the bandits, began to give them a history lesson, which he critted. Davias went around and used the distraction to cut a belt, so when combat did break out, that bandit would be tripping over themselves\n\nElron had now taken out his crossbow and began giving the history behind that as well, and has laid it out on the bartop for all to see. Accidentally, his finger slips, nailing the first in the chest. Combat has officially started. Davias stabs another bandit in the back, dealing a whopping 1 damage. Pheonix uses this distraction to leap over a table and dropkick the third in the chest\n\nNow dear sweet Orryn, roused from his beer in the corner, decides to ally with the other bar patrons and instead of using his crossbow throws a mug at one of the bandits. The badnits miss terribly, and Elron fires again at the head bandit, before ducking behind the bartop. Davias charges his bandit with a stool, pinning him to the bar, as Pheonix and Orryn deal with the third through combined might of fists and assorted thrown objects. \n\nDavias and Elron both wail on the pinned bandit, and Davias tries a fancty move of unpinning the guy to smack him with the stool that backfires and gets him slashed, but through enough punches and stabs, he's put down. Pheonix takes out the head bandit by grabbing the bolts in his chest and suplexing him into a table. \n\nWith the bandits taken care of, Davias kindly offers the barkeep all of the 5 gold the bandit had on him, keeping the other 10 pieces for himself. They learn that these are bandits under the command of Greathorn, who's holed up in a cave near the city. With this news, our brave heroes set off to  find him. Upon arriving, we found out that King Ludwig II had cracked down on practically everything and the people were upset.\n\nWalking around in the city, some random Greathorn thug with a blowgun stole our gold . Big mistake, as we were on him in a second and punched his teeth in. We managed to coerce the location of Greathorn's hideout, and we embarked into the forest. We reached a magical glade with a cave and waterfall, where we met some random wizard lady named Clarissa (or maybe Cassandra?) who had just stumbled on this cave. We decided that it would be worth exploring, and ventured in with her, utilizng the Scoop spell to ensure dry clothes. Inside we found what was obviously a bandit hideout, and after an eternity of cautious searching, we found Greathorn's throne room.\n\nIn the center of the room was a massive stone chair, which we very cautiously approached. It was just a chair, turns out. By this time Clarissa was bored with our slow progress so she left back up the cave. Further exploration of the room led us to a box with a bag full of some sort of black wool. Lighting this material on fire from safely behind the chair yielded a small explosion. Excited over our new findings, we decided to use a wadded up tissue sized portion to blow up the chair, and a second later it was reduced to rubble. We figured out we had about 19 chairs-worth of this material left, and needed to conserve it. \n\nHeading back towards the entrance, Clarissa was nowhere to be found, but signs of struggle were evident, and the entrance of the cave had a blood trail leading towards the city. We went to the guardhouse to try and find information, where the guards accused us of attempting to rape Clarissa and took us to the courts.\n\nWe were thrown in front of Ludwig II, and it became abundantly clear that he was simply a puppet for his mysterious adviser, what a shock. What followed, on our way to jail, was a very serious, lengthy discussion on whether or not we should use our bag of chairs-worth to kill the king and seize power. We decided against it once it became clear that we would also die in the explosion.\n\nIn the holding cell, we attempted to pull down the grated window and make our escape, when one of the NPC prisoners rolled a 1 on their strength check. He proceeded to twist his ankle and scream in agony, alerting 4 guards. Davias managed to convince them that the other prisoners were planning an escape, and their accomplice was waiting outside, so 2 guards went to investigate. \n\nOne guard went inside our cell to carry out the wounded man, and that's when we made the simplest of plans; steal the keys. Davias fudged the roll, and the guard was alerted to our plan, and called in his friend to take care of us while he carried the prisoner out.\n\nTo call that fight a slaughter would have been an understatement. They didn't land a hit on us, as we just laid into them. The RNG our DM was using gave each of them upwards of 30 health, but only 10 AC so they just crumbled. Orryn attempted unsuccessfully to help the wounded prisoner, and ended up breaking his ankle instead. Climbing up the stairs to the prison proper led us to windows where we saw a riot forming between the guards and the commoners led by a massive man in plate.\n\nQuick sleuthing let us figure out that this man was Greathorn, the bandit we'd been trying to hunt down. A debate took place on who to help, and we eventually landed on aiding the rebels. Davias' bluffing managed to snag us some more black wool, bringing us to 24 chairs-worth Climbing on the rooftops, with Elron failing a short jump twice, we decided to blow the gates to the castle wide open. attaching two chairs-worth to a crossbow bolt and firing it into the gate, they exploded and the rebels rushed in, only for us to hear the sound of a dragon roaring in the distance.",

        "text": "This is a continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4nhrd8/35e_the_city_of_the_ghost_yakmen_things/)\n\nAfter discovering that the people of the town they were visiting were being controlled by ghost yaks, our heroes bickered for a while on how to deal with the situation, and eventually Coraim went down from the tower to reason with one of the yaks, it did not go well. Vito tried to intimidate the yak Coraim was talking to, but several more yaks began to surround the party. When I say yaks I mean people controlled by yaks, but yaks is easier to say. It was clear shit was about to go down, so Vito vaulted over one of the yaks, landing outside of the ring of them who were now surrounding the party, Lexter summoned a mount and began riding on it with Iaghar, who was attacking several yaks with his axe from the horse. Meanwhile Felosial used Iron Body because apparently nobody told her player that domain spells have spell levels and she can't have a level 8 spell for her level 2 domain spell, and nobody questioned it when she turned into goddamn living iron at level 3, in retrospect that was stupid, but it led to something cool. Coraim used sound burst while the party covered their ears, injuring the yaks and stunning half of them. Next, Iaghar tried to pick up Coraim while riding his horse and throw him so Coraim could shoot the yak-man that seemed like the leader (taller, better clothes and stuff)... and failed miserably, both fell to the ground.\n\nThe next round Coraim had a new plan, using Summon Monster I he summoned a porpoise, yes you heard that right, a porpoise, on land. But he didn't just summon it, he summoned it in the air, moving towards the yak leader. By this point the party had figured out that when one of the yak people is killed, the yak controlling them materialized and continues fighting, and had killed the human part of the leader. After summoning the porpoise, Coraim yelled \"Lexter, shoot fire up when you see a porpoise\", and, having delayed his action to Lexter's turn, Lexter was able to react (albeit confused) in time to catch the porpoise on fire.\n\nLet's recap, we now have a mob of people being controlled by ghost yaks attacking our favorite murderhobos, and their leader is being targeted by a flaming death porpoise that acts as a torpedo.\n\nSo the porpoise flew towards the leader of the yaks, and Felosial held him in place so he couldn't dodge it. The DM rolled to see if the porpoise hits, ruling flaming death porpoise's as an improvised weapon... critical fucking hit.\n\nThe porpoise explodes in a cloud of entrails and fire, and it's flaming remains fly like shrapnel, mowing down all but a few of the yaks. Despite suffering a direct hit from the porpoise, the leader survives, but is promptly finished of by Iaghar. Iaghar then mentions how he wants a yaxe, which is an axe with a yak head attached to it.\n\nThen, we see someone come out of the tavern nearby... none other than Eramil Sionndel, the bard and trickster that the party had encountered in [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4i3c3s/the_disapearing_tavern/). Coraim and Iaghar tried to attack Eramil but he disappeared and reappeared behind them, before making several dozen copies of himself to surround the party. To be continued.\n\nEdit: Before the porpoise was fired Vito snuck up behind the leader of the yaks and killed his human form with a sneak attack, which of course made the entire group demonstrate various Skyrim stealth kill moves for about 7 minutes.",

This guy Tom who I don't know is playing as an American intelligence officer interred in a British corps. Like two hours into the game Tom starts suspecting this Turkish informant we're working with. \n\nA bunch of complicated plot mechanics ensue and it seems like there might be legitimate reason to suspect this guy so Tom decides to test him out. He gets him aside in a secure location and starts playing coy like he's also a double agent. At this point we're all getting really into it; it was legitimately the best RP of intrigue I've played in a game, until . . .\n\nTom, seemingly having gotten signal from this guy that they're both double crossers decides to put his cards on the table and stands up and calls \"Heil Hitler!\" while giving the Nazi salute. In a realistic World War I campaign.\n\nWe're all looking at him aghast for his stupidity, which he I guess identifies as oversensitivity and says: \"What?! It's not me saying it, it's my character.\"\n\nWe're still looking dumbfounded. He turns to the GM and says \"So what does the guy do? Is he a Nazi?\" Our GM deadpans \"definitely not a Nazi.\" To which we all burst out laughing.\n\nWe couldn't really recover the sense of realism after that one. But it was worth it for the hilarity.",

        "text": "Sit back and relax, r/gametales.  I have looked a long time for a place to deposit these stories, and now I think I might have finally found them.\n\nFirst, some context - these characters were our first experience playing Anima: Beyond Fantasy, which is a HIDEOUSLY balanced system.  If you've played any tabletop RPG, you're used to your characters starting small and growing big.  In Anima, characters start big and grow absolutely HUGE.  Allow me to set everything up for you by introducing your recurring cast of characters.\n\n**Albert Rickard** - Our protagonist, my PC.  Albert was a Warlock, which in Anima is a fighter/wizard hybrid class.  All the martial prowess of the fighter, all the magic of the wizard, you just basically develop zero secondary skills.  This was offset by taking the Jack of All Trades advantage, which basically gave him an absolute minor proficiency in every skill.\n\nIn Anima, there are 9 books of magic, and you have to choose which ones you wish you use.  In Albert's case, he took Creation magic (which at the lower levels allows you to make mundane objects out of nothing, repair things, shield and heal, but at the higher levels allows you to literally create lifeforms and souls,) and Destruction magic (the opposite of creation.  It's good at low levels for breaking things and doing a little damage, but the higher level spells just obliterate armies.)  \n\nAlbert was the son of a noble house that had been thought to be completely obliterated when they were betrayed and sold out by their neighbors, and his family was butchered by mercenaries.  So he grew up as an extremely powerful child that wanted nothing more than revenge, and to make sure that nothing like that would happen to him again.  This wound up snowballing over the years until he developed a simple goal - he wanted to become a God.  Which, in the rules of anima, is actually extremely possible.  He eventually adopted the moniker of \"The Demon King,\" which is how he became legend.\n\n**Matthew Revale** - Albert's closest ally, and another PC.  Where Albert's alignment would have been questionable at best, Matthew was staunchly good.  He had no remorse for those who did evil, and he knew that sometimes the best way to punish them involved simply turning Al loose.  Matt traveled with Al for two reasons: One, he believed there was actual good in that man somewhere, and he would see it brought out.  Two, he believed that by staying close to Al and keeping a bit of influence over him, he could keep Al reigned in.\n\nMatthew was a Warrior Summoner, which was a hybrid fighter/summoner.  Martial prowess of the warrior, summon powers, but again like no skills.  Matthew also possessed the gift of magic, and his book of choice was Essence, meaning he could basically control life and nature.  As an example, he had a spell that caused him to age at 1/100th the rate of a normal person.  \n\nThere would eventually be a third person in their crew, but at the moment she wasn't present, so this first story will simply involve the two of them.\n\nAl and Matt, in need of both food and something to do (because as we all know, boredom and power are dangerous things to mix,) accepted a contract from a wealthy man to take care of a bandit camp.  The two of them set off, armed and ready to roll.  It was a few hours travel, and they arrived at the \"camp\"... which turned out to be a fortress.\n\nOh well, no sense in wasting a good first session.  The two of them circled it from the outside and eventually decided the best method of attack was deception.  They approached the front gate, and a sentry mounted on the wall called down to them and leveled a bow.  \n\nWhile Matthew BS-ed with him and fed him a story about the two of them being lost, Albert was casting a spell.  He invoked Physical Control, a creation spell that let you seize control of a living being.  Dice were rolled, the spell hit, and the sentry failed his resistance check, so he became Al's puppet.  \n\nNow, when you get an order that would contradict your nature, you have the right to make a second resist roll immediately.  Which he did, and he failed again, because Al's high power meant the resist threshold was VERY high for a level one or two character, and the man promptly dove off the wall, screaming as he fell and landed on his head.  Dead on impact.\n\nWell, that got attention from the rest of the wall sentries.  They looked over, Albert and Matt started screaming about how he fell, and he looked like he was dying, and by God, help, and the doors opened as five bandits ran out to check on their comrade.  \n\n5 bandits on 2 adventurers sounds like suicide, but they didn't know (and honestly, we didn't 100% know) exactly how stupid powerful we were.  But, now that the gates were open, we decided the best course of action was to just go in guns blazing.  Matt drew his sabre, Al drew his bastard sword, and we started swinging.  One of the bandits got early initiative, but thanks to an open rolled defense (Anima's version of a critical - d100 system, if your roll is above 90, you roll again and keep adding the results,) Matthew got a nice counterattack bonus (If you defend successfully you can burn your turn to counterattack,) and obliterated his attacker in one swing.  Using a magical shield, Al tanked a couple of attacks, while Matt dove into the fray.  Three or so rounds later, the group laid dead, and we were basically unhurt (Al missed a block and caught a minor damage thrust.)\n\nWalking into the courtyard of the fortress, Matt made a notice check that revealed that most of the bandits had moved up onto the wall and were leveling crossbows at us.  Both of us started to cast at the same time, Al raising a magical shield while Matt accelerated nature's growth, and a couple of small trees nearby grew and twisted and formed a barrier of thick wood around us.  \n\nWe needed a new plan, and we needed it fast.  Digging into the book of creation, I found an absolutely stupid spell called \"Damage Barrier.\"  It just gives the target a damage barrier of X amount, and in Anima, if your attack cannot inflict X at minimum, or you cannot damage energy (so either magical attacks, or energy based ones,) you just can't hurt the target at all.\n\nSo Al gave himself a damage barrier of 200, which pretty much made him immune to anything short of a martial artist, which these bandits were not, he walked out of the grove and just kind of laughed madly as arrow after arrow pounded against him and did absolutely nothing.  He walked up the wall and began to stalk along it, and if you've ever seen League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, it looked a lot like the scene when Dorian Gray does his thing.  Somewhere, the theme from The Terminator was playing, and while everyone was focused on Al, Matt dove into them from behind, and the two of them slaughtered the fortress to the last man.  30+ on 2, and the 30+ did not stand a chance.\n\nThat was the moment we realized that this game system was going to be absurdly entertaining to play in.  If people enjoyed, and there's more interest, I'll post more stories about them.  We played these characters in a persistent world for about 3 years IRL.",

        "author": "kkjdroid",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4odcgt/dnd_5e_too_much_power_in_a_premade_warning_dragon/",
        "text": "So I'm a reasonably experienced player and I like 5e. /u/iwalkudie made a post on /r/lfg asking someone to DM 5e for him and his bunch of misfits and I thought I'd try my hand. We settle on Hoard of the Dragon Queen for the setting because I can't worldbuild and we gets started.\n\nI decide that the best balance of fair and interesting is for me to roll stats once and everyone to use those as if they'd rolled them. I previously had a player roll something like 18/16/16/14/13/11, so I didn't want that to happen with just one person and everything to break. Naturally, I rolled 17/16/16/13/11/9, which is nearly as broken. 4d6d1 seems way better than point buy. \n\nGoing into the first session, we have: \n\n* Tyreesus, the black Jesus. 8 feet, 335lb of Goliath Barbarian. Dumped Int but still had 9 of it, because of the crazy rolls. Chaotic good, or at least that was the plan.\n* Tharivol Galandel. High-elf Ranger. Actually ranged, unlike a lot of rangers. Neutral Good.\n* Harat Silverhood. Mountain Dwarf Fighter, used Battlemaster and Action Surge to give Tyreesus extra attacks and otherwise just tanked hits. Dropped out after we realized that one session a week wasn't enough for us and that three sounded better.\n* butt butterscotch, no capitals. Halfling Cleric, Lawful Good. \n* Maedhros Hastar, using the randomly-generated Roll20 name. Tiefling Warlock. Didn't get the message about this being a Good party, so he's Neutral Evil with the occasional foray into Chaotic. \n\nThe first session pretty much goes as planned. They find the town they're supposed to defend and they defend it. I misjudge one fight because of the power of ten kobolds with slings and group initiative and a couple of people go down. Tyreesus dies, but they win the fight in the end. I resurrect Tyreesus because it's the first session, but let the players know that that's a one-time deal. \n\nThey long-rest, because I didn't notice that that wasn't supposed to be an option, and level up to 2. Maedhros gets one lv1 spell slot that comes back on a short rest. He takes Shatter. The guy in charge of the fort points out Frulam Mondath to them and says \"Don't fight her, she's too strong.\" They decide that that's their cue to fight her. Maedhros Shatters her guards, killing most of them instantly and gaining CHA + Warlock level temp HP for each one due to his pact. He now has more temp HP than he has regular HP. Frulam tries a couple of Mass Hold Persons, but The Black Jesus saves and he and the ranged PCs finish the guards, incap Frulam, and take her back for questioning. \n\nLangdedrosa Cyanwrath, a CR 4 half-dragon champion, challenges them. A weary Tyreesus (I had figured out the long rest thing) steps up and promptly takes half his health from the breath weapon. Lang's contingency plan for the rest of the party was to have his personal troop of 16 kobolds guarding an innocent woman who had been taken prisoner. Big mistake--the Warlock is NE. He Shatters the group, killing all of the Kobolds and the woman instantly (even by PC rules--they took double their max health in damage). Then, he intervenes in the fight with Cyanwrath. The half-dragon keeps attacking Tyreesus, but doesn't manage to down him before the combined attacks of the three PCs take him down. The governor of the town is furious, but then Maedhros rolls a 25 on Persuasion and gets him to accept the casualty in exchange for revenge. \n\nThey find the next plot hook, a mission to search the raiders' camp and find the monk Leosin Erlanthar. They nuke the stragglers, dodge the rear guard, and get to the camp. Between the 100ft of rope from two explorer's packs and Maedhros' teleport, they sneak in a back way, down a cliffside. They immediately turn their attention to the big, important tent. The guards absolutely will not let them in, so Maedhros asks them to bring Rezmir out so that she can approve him to come in. Rolls a 20 after bonuses. One guard goes in and retrieves Rezmir. Maedhros rolls to seduce her. Natural twenty, 26 total. Since you can't technically crit checks, I had Rezmir just be a bit attracted to him and invite him inside. Once in, he rolls Performance to bed her. Natural twenty again. They bang, then he sneak attacks her in bed. The party kills Rezmir (the CR 7 BBEG whom the guide book says to try to keep alive through what's supposed to be their first meeting three chapters from now) and her companion (was supposed to be Frulam, but she's in jail in Greenest...). They take Hazirawn (replaces Tyreesus' greataxe) and the black dragon mask (Maedhros sheds his armor and gets 19 AC before any spells). I think they hit lv4 at this point.\n\nThey rescue the monk and sneak out the way they came. Tharivol, who had remained on the cliff, sets fire to some tents elsewhere in the camp as a distraction, so no one notices the fight or the PCs absconding with the former prisoners. They get back to Greenest safely. Erlanthar promptly sends them back to the camp to check out the cave. \n\nIn the dragon hatchery, they melt a few kobolds, then find the roper. Maedhros, in all his wisdom, decides to stealth around the roper, but then he Shatters some kobolds within tentacle range and gets grabbed. The roper also manages to lock down butt and Tharivol, but it crit fails the swing at Tyreesus and he's able to disable the fourth tentacle without destroying it, so the roper can't make another. Maedhros puts up a couple of Clouds of Daggers on the roper, then goes down to a 50-odd-damage critical bite. The other three finish it off and pick him up, then long rest in the shadows. They decide to take all three black dragon eggs, even after the voice in Maedhros' head (yours truly, of course) reminds him that they're CE, more like humans than pets, can kick your ass right after hatching, and take centuries to mature. Goliaths get double carry weight and Tyreesus has 19 STR, so 450lb of dragon eggs only really stops him from sprinting.\n\nNow, they get the good old follow the caravan mission. I end up just doing every random event. Tharivol takes the golden stag as his personal mission--between the Ranger/animal companion pairing and both characters being elves, there's a strong connection. I give him the +1 longbow anyway--after all, Tyreesus has a legendary sword that's +2 and does 4d6 damage.  The PCs nearly get into a fight with the actors posing as guards as soon as they meet, but they hold off and become the heroes when the giant spiders scare the shit out of the actors. The fight is extremely one-sided: no horses are even detached from the caravan. \n\nMaedhros realizes that the buxom twins on the side of the road are changelings. Instead of telling anyone, he decides to ask for a threesome. He passes the high DC I had put on it, then rolls a nat 1 for performance. Cue erectile dysfunction. He then reveals their identity as changelings to the party, to which they respond by insulting his manhood. They leave. That night, one of them morphs into a bloodied Maedhros, then calls out for help while the other stands over her with a dagger. Tyreesus hears. Tharivol should have too, but I didn't realize how hard the changelings hit. Tyreesus rushes in and immediately gets double-crit when the morphed changeling sneak-attacks him. He barely wins the fight, mostly due to Stone's Endurance and Hazirawn. The party hits lv5 (I'm using one number for party XP).\n\nFor some reason, there's a place where there are three CR 8 assassins who are acting like assholes and goading the PCs into a fight. They oblige and shitstomp the assassins, even though one assassin against five lv5 PCs is supposed to be a Hard fight, two is supposed to be Deadly, and there are three assassins. They get to lv6 and reach Daggerford. Maedhros falls prey to metagaming when Jamna doesn't want to talk to him about the Zhentarim (nat 20 Insight and Criminal background, they're the fantasy [ilerminaty](/r/ilerminaty)) in front of the whole caravan despite his 20-odd Persuasion rolls. She takes him into a bar and explains things.\n\nI'll continue later, probably regardless of the reception to this. Iwalk, feel free to add details and let the other guys do the same. ",

        "text": "Our tale starts on an Ark survival evolved PvE server, after many months of playing on PvP servers and getting fucked over by random badmins using server commands to spawn in high lvl mounts for themselves and fucking up our base, my group and I decided to switch to PvE to see if that makes it any better.\n\n\nSo after about 10 hours on that new server we have our base up and running but as it turns out, there's not much to do on a PvE server apart from taming dinosaurs. At this point we decide to leave base for a bit, traveling as a group to see if there's any fun to be had with other players. Most ignore us straight up and just go on their merry way, only few drop a line or two in chat.\n\n\nThat's when a plan is hatched to raid a high level base on top of a hill we've been circling around for a while now. I'm talking massive behemoth gates up front, huge wooden palisades all around. The real deal and some sweet loot guaranteed. Only problem is, with it being a non hostile environment, you can't so much as touch other players properties. No destruction, no nothing. But the catch is, other peoples dinos also can't hurt you. First thing on the list of how the fuck to get in is to find an unlocked entrance, with that we spend the next 30 minutes searching around looking for anything that seems unsecured but this thing was tighter than Fort Knox. All doors password protected or straight up locked. The thing with fences in this game is that they only really work as intended when the ground is even. Owing to the fact that this massive shining beacon of loot was placed on top of a hill meant that the fences didn't connect to the ground very well in some places and after about an hour of dicking around, I found a tiny hole just big enough for us to squeeze through.\n\n\nWe were now inside the base, or I should say inside goddamn Jurassic Park as the courtyard was filled to the brim with any kind of dinosaur imaginable. As we made our way to the main building we saw a ramp leading up this massive metal tower with at it's base a tiny wooden door. Wide open. Jackpot. We make our way inside the main building and as we step through the door we collectively shit our pants as we see one of the residents just taking a nap on the floor. For a moment we discuss if we should leave, but fuck that. We've come this far already, might as well go all the way. The first and second floor were practically empty, except for a few beds and a furnace containing a bakers dozen of iron ingots. But as we climbed up the third ladder we saw it. The promised land. A room filled with what must have been an odd 20 large storage boxes. We stumble around for a bit to make sure that no one's around then we get to the looting. Except we didn't, because those damn boxes were pass code protected as well. 4 digits, 1000 combinations. We couldn't try them all, so we went with the obvious ones first none worked. About to give up and more as a joke than anything I tried 1337. Bam box opens, jaw drops, loot flies right into my backpack. I try the next box, same pass code, next one, same pass code. We proceed to loot this place absolutely dry, blue prints, rare materials, dino saddles. Everything.\n\n\nWe made our glorious escape and lived happily ever after. At least we thought so, we got about 20 yards away from the base until we noticed that we were only two, we had left one of us behind. Just as we turned around to go and retrieve him, we see a pterodactyl land in the base, two people on it. Bad timing, we write to him in-game to try and warn him. Then we see the messages pop up in global chat, they realized that someone had robbed them blind but seemingly they had no idea who it was and that one of the culprits was still inside their base right now.  We didn't hear from our missing friend for about 5 minutes until we see him talking to them in global chat, explaining that he just wandered into their base because everything was open, that he didn't steal anything from them. Well that bluff failed completely and they pondered over what to do with him as they couldn't really kill him, they wanted to lock him up in a cell and see how long they could keep him. Then silence. After another minute or 2 of us discussing if we should go back confess the whole thing and trade their stuff for our friend, I see the back door swing open and a guy runs out and jumps straight off the cliff behind the building right into the lake below. It was that goddamn daredevil, he had escaped them somehow. As they didn't think he had any way to get out, they had turned their backs for a few moments. He took that opportunity to make a mad dash for the door entered the same pass code we used before and it worked. In order to get away from them as fast as possible he ran out of their base and jumped straight off the cliff. We regrouped at a forest near the lake shortly after and made our way back to our home, with a metric ton of loot and one of the best in game stories I have to this day.\n\n\nThanks for reading ",

But we could try, damn it!\n\nIt started as a regular game of Mann vs Machine. For those who don't know what that is, you and up to five other players have to defend a point on the map from a horde of bomb-carrying robots. We had just finished fighting the robots, and while the map was changing I had a genius idea.\n\n\"full engineer team\" I typed, my fingers trembling with excitement.\n\n...\n\n\"lol ok\"\n\nYES! I had recruited my first Engineer. I set up my sentry gun just outside the spawn point, with a dispenser next to me so I could regain health and ammo infinitely. I don't know where the other player was at that time, probably stroking his teleporter or something. Another player joined the game.\n\n\"full engineer team\" I typed once again.\n\nIt took a few seconds, but then the Heavy icon switched to the Engineer. And then another player joined. This one wanted to be a Sniper, but after a bit of convincing he joined in with the Engineer party. Now we had four, things were really starting to take shape. A fifth player joined. This time it didn't take any convincing.\n\nAnd then the final player entered the game.\n\nHe was a Pyro. He refused to be an Engineer. There was no time to make him join our cult- I mean, team. The round started.\n\nWith our sentries, shotguns and wrenches, we decimated the robot forces. EZ win. GG. The Pyro became an Engineer. Mission complete, now we had a full... Wait, what?\n\nWe had been betrayed. One of our Engineer friends had become a Soldier. We tried to make him an Engineer once again, but he didn't comply.\n\nThat's when the floodgates opened, and the second wave of robots game rushing in. This time, it was a lot more difficult. I abandoned my machines and jumped into the fray, as did a few of my teammates. I managed to take down a few enemies before I saw my worst nightmare... *A robot Engineer.*\n\nI drew my shotgun and blasted it into his cold, soulless, metal body as he ran away. Powered by my fury and knowledge of Engineer-y stuff, I pursued him while firing. He was a tough one. That's when he stopped and began building a sentry.\n\nI knew I had no chance. I was outnumbered, one Engineer vs two machines. The turret opened fire, but I barely escaped with minimal health. I managed to just make it back to my dispenser and get healed up, when I saw a scout carrying the bomb to the hatch.\n\nI leapt down from my perch and opened fire, while my turret defended me from above. With the help of my fellow Engineers (and the Soldier *grumble grumble*) we killed the Scout. If it had taken a second longer, he would've been down the hatch and we would've been defeated. But we weren't just a team, we were a team of ENGINEERS! And we powered on, with wave two eliminated.\n\nThe Soldier, realising how powerful Engineers were, rejoined our ranks. All was good... Wait, seriously? One of our Engineers had become a Spy. Enough was enough, we decided there was just one thing to do. We had to sacrifice the traitor. It was the only thing we could do. With that, a vote was called. The Spy was gone.\n\nNow we were down to five, but we finally had our full engineer team. Time for wave three. We all had plenty of upgrades, and were ready to take down the oncoming army. Or so we thought.\n\nThey overwhelmed us. While we waited around the hatch, the Medic robot was charging his invulnerability by healing a Heavy robot. This wouldn't have been so bad... But they had the bomb. We weren't expecting it. As they rounded the corner, the Medic activated his UberCharge. The Heavy fired at us and our turrets, as it slowly approached the hatch. There was nothing we could do. We fought valiantly, trying to destroy them, but it was too late. The bomb had been delivered. We could only watch as the ground exploded in front of us, before we were all gunned down by the robot forces.\n\n**That wave lasted about a minute.**\n\nIt turns out that a full team of Engineers is a terrible idea.\n\n[Some screenshots I took.](http://imgur.com/a/GbUcg) Names have been edited out. And yes, there's a Scout in the final one, I guess he must have joined just before the third wave started.",

        "text": "Let me just start by saying our entire group, including the DM, are relatively new to tabletop. So if anything is weird that's probably why. Also, I wrote a little bit about our party [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3x6jcu/dd_5th_edition_bar_fight_go/) if anyone wants more detailed descriptions of all characters. With that out of the way, on to the story.\n\n***\n\nOur tale begins with our group trying to track down a flying sky castle currently in use by a cult of Tiamat. We had struck a deal with a member of the cult who wanted some of her superiors dead to give us info on where the castle would be anchored and how to get in safely.\n\nWe had just arrived at the village near our destination and set about getting prepared and seeing all this village had to offer. Our half-elven ranger (Lyria) decided to relax at the bar, our human Barbarian (Kraigon) and Drow arcane trickster (Corvo) went into the woods to hunt for some fresh meat, and our half-elven dragon sorceress (Aliella) wanted to go out and search for firefly wings.\n\nNow, to give a bit of information on Aliella. You see she was a bit... off. Technically most of the party were off in their own unusual ways, but Aliella was special. She claimed to have voices in her head. Dark things that would whisper sweet nothings and promises in the dead of night. Occasionally, these voices would drive her to a murderous rage. Now most sane people would have taken notice of this and refused to travel with her. But our party stuck with her because: one she was very good at her job of killing things, and two as long as she had a steady source of monsters to quench her bloodlust she was the sweetest person you could ever hope to meet. She tried to burn Kraigon's face once but no permanent damage was done so we all tried to laugh it off (except Kraigon of course).\n\nNow, we had been traveling the roads for quite a few weeks and everything had been very peaceful. No monsters, no bandits, nothing. So my Human bard (Fredrick) and our Halfling assassin (Alton) were rightfully worried about letting her go explore on her own lest half the town be electrocuted to death. My bard especially since he had been trying to find some way to help cure her of what he believed to be psychosis.\n\nSo I agree to help her search for dragonfly wings to keep an eye on her, while Alton follows us stealthily from behind. We wander about the village, then head into the woods.  Things were calm for the most part, but Aliella claimed she was getting a progressively worse headache. I'm getting a tad nervous when we happen upon Kraigon and Corvo who had apparently just killed a bear. We talked about how to prepare bear meat, Kraigon was planning on making fur clothes for anyone that wanted, and Aliella seemed to be easing up a little. Around that time Alton makes himself known, having apparently found a firefly and stripped it of its wings.\n\nHe hands them to Aliella and suddenly everything goes straight to Hell.\n\nShe grabs hold of the sides of her head, starts screaming bloody murder, then casts fear on us. We all make the save, and Aliella seems to pass out on the ground.\n\nKraigon, not wanting to have anything to do with this situation, hefts the bear carcass and starts making his way back to the village, Corvo right behind him.\n\nI pull Alton off to the side and try to think of something, for the first time thinking this might be something more than your average mental problems. He looks up above my head, points, and says \"Gee, ya think?\"\n\nI turn around to see that Aliella has woken up, somehow scaled the tallest nearby tree, and is chanting in some form of infernal language causing a thunderstorm to appear. As lightning strikes a couple of the nearby trees, setting them ablaze, Aliella floats down in front of me. I realize at that moment that Alton is gone and I am alone.\n\nShe smiles at me, and in a voice that is at least three octaves lower asks if I would like to play a game. Not knowing what else to do I reply, \"Sure. What are we going to play? Tag?\"\n\nShe chuckles, \"Actually I thought we could play the try not to be turned to ashes game. But you can call it whatever you want.\"\n\nI was debating running away when I see Alton rush out from cover behind her. He leaped into the air and brought the pommel of his dagger onto the back of her skull to knock her out. Or that was the plan anyways. She just kept floating there after staggering a bit, then turned and glared at Alton, growling something about it not being very nice to cheat.\n\nPanicking I decided to distract her. I yelled, \"Hey, this is tag remember! You gotta catch me first\", then ran off hoping she would follow me. Luckily, or maybe not, she did. Not having really thought that far ahead, I just keep running in the hopes I can think of a better plan.\n\nThis ends when I am spun around as Aliella caught up with me. As shes staring me in the eyes I try the only thing left I can think of that might hurt whatever is inside of her. I cast dissonant whispers at the highest level I can. Somehow, that worked. She writhes about, making horrific noises before her eyes roll back and she collapses. I check her and somehow she is still alive.\n\nI sigh as Alton finally catches up with me and asks if I'm alright. I let him know I'm fine but probably gonna sit and rest a bit. He says he thinks that is a bad idea, and waves his hand about to remind me that the forest is now ON FIRE.\n\nCue me grabbing both Alton and Aliella, and running screaming through a burning forest all the way back to the pub/inn.\n\nWe didn't have anymore problems with her mood swings after that.\n",

        "text": "So I have my players in the bottom level of a torture dungeon. I created this lovely map with tiles, walls, skeletons, piles of rotten meat, torches, and a necromancers desk. \n\nMy players are facing a behemoth Zombie mass; a giant zombie composed of parts of other zombies. They are currently trying to light a bone wrapped in cloth with on fire with some flint and steel they have. As they are all debating what they will do while failing their rolls to light it; I ask my bard to roll an Spot check. She succeeded, then I had her roll an int check for shits and giggles. Nat 1. I have her walk over and I whisper in her ear what to do.\n\nShe moves her character to the wall and back, to the bewilderment of the players. Dm is me, Shay is her, players are everyone else.\n\nDM-As you are attempting to light this bone, you find yourself illuminated by a flickering yellow glow. It's also a few degrees warmer now.\n\nPlayers- What's causing it?\n\nDM-...You didn't see...roll a search check.\n\nPlayers-15\n\nDM- Shay is holding a torch.\n\nPlayers- Shay?!? Where did you get the torch?\n\nShay- Well it was dark, I couldn't see what you were attempting to light on fire. So I thought I would grab one of the many torches from the wall so I could see better.\n\nOne of my team looked at the map and couldn't stop laughing. The girl who is her partner in the game (Inigo Montoya to her Fezzik) Looked at her calmly, holding back laughter and said...\n\nPlayer-Your using a torch...to help you see...what we are trying &amp; failing...to light. On. Fire???\n\nDM *While laughing* \"Roll another Int check\"  18\n\nShe describes it as the scene from Jumanji, where the kid needs the axe in the shed, which is locked. So he grabs a nearby axe to break in, realizes after a few swings he's holding what he needs, looks at the audience, then heads back to the adventure.\n\nThey forget the bone, use the torch, and end up defeating the mass by Covering the torch in superflammable oil (can't be put out easy) then running and driving the torch into the creatures chest cavity.",

        "text": "Read a few of the amazing stories on here, and while none of mine are as epic many on here I thought I could share the tale of how my first d&amp;d group began.\n\nLittle nublet me, in grade 8 found my dad's old box of D&amp;D stuff in the basement of grandpa's house. Dad wasn't around as a kid, so of course wanted to do something that I thought would make him proud of me. Decide to buy the beginner AD&amp;D box from local game store, read through the rules, and ask some of my classmates if they wanted to play over lunch break at school. \n\nThere were six kids who wanted to play, so it took about a week to get everyone familiar enough with the game and character sheets to try and start a game. Starter kit came with a premade one-shot that took place in a small town on the edge of a lake. On the edge of town was an old abandoned covered and very long bridge, described as dried out and creaky in the adventure, that lead to a small island and an old haunted wizard tower. The brave party of 8th graders set out to help un-haunt the tower.\n\nThe 6 of them arrive at the bridge, which they discover is full of spider webs inside. None of them were afraid, so the dwarf warrior leads the way in, brushing the webs out of the way as he goes. 4 others follow with our edgy rogue stalking in at the back. Now, the rogue in real life had been going through a little pyro phase. This managed to rear its ugly neck in game.\n\nBeing about half way across the long bridge, the party was getting into the thick of the spider webs, which were slowing down their movement speed. The little pyro rogue gets a bright idea, and lights a torch from his adventure pack. At the same time, the party finds some spiders are angry for some crazy people trashing their house, who attack the dwarf warrior at the front. \n\nNow, the THAC0 of the spiders was pretty high, or low, or whichever way made it harder to hit them. The spiders were really quite weak, didn't do a TON of damage, and would pretty much die from one good smack. They did however have a poison bite that would make a player unable to move for 1d4 turns.\n\nThe dwarf gets unlucky, and cannot hit any of the spiders for a couple rounds. The girl playing the wizard elf managed to kill one with a magic missile, but got bit by a second spider. I forget what the other players were doing, but they were generally not doing very well. The rogue panics, seeing some party members not able to move, and only one spider dying, decides to light the webs on fire to scare the spiders. Which he does, behind him. So, me as little nublet DM thinking that the bridge being old and dry means they would burn well. \n\nSo, I say that the webs catch, and the flames start spreading up. Next round, I tell them the roof of the bridge begins to burn behind the party, which makes the spiders back up a bit. Rogue keeps panicking and tosses the torch, over the party, to land near the spiders. Now the party is trapped between two sides of burning bridge. \n\nLong story short, the spiders are retreating, 3 party members are paralyzed. Dwarf warrior picks up the wizard girl, and turns tail and runs back towards the start of the bridge, making a great roll to jump over the burning section while carrying her. Rogue has long since run back towards the start of the bridge. Two of the paralyzed players burn to death. Paladin, having taken a couple rounds of fire damage uses his lay on hands to heal himself, then tried to make the jump over the burning section of bridge back to safety. \n\nPaladin is not very dexterous in his armor. Paladin didn't train in athletics. Paladin rolls a 2. I rule that he lands in the middle of the fire, and that the section has been damaged enough from the fire at this point, that the weight of him and his gear smash him through the floor, into the lake below. \n\nThe paladin barely survives the swim back to shore, with some help from the dwarf warrior. \n\nThe two kids that died got upset and tattled on our teacher, so we weren't allowed to play D&amp;D at lunch anymore.\n\nAnd that's how I met my best friends, game night started happening every Wednesday at my house after school, and the merry band of the Heroic Dwarf, The Fainting Wizard, The Clumsy Paladin, and Fire-Obsessed Rogue joined forces.\n\n\nOh, and that wizard tower stayed haunted, with a couple dead PC's adding to the mysterious power growing there. But now there wasn't a bridge to it anymore.",

        "text": "**The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4n18ur/dnd_5e_death_and_the_weight_it_carries/) (Chapter 19/33)\n\n*Halejk La’Dhroo ab Jujnis, 2997*\n\n\nI feel myself slipping away. Or at least the good I use to see in everything is slipping through my fingers. It’s getting tiresome pretending to be alright. It’s beginning to feel more and more like everyone is expecting me to fight, to harm, to kill... at least, that is what Rora chastised me about. \n\nA hermit Troll, whom Kimaris knew to be hospitable, gave us each a tea that took us on a spirit journey. I was hesitant at first, Kimaris promising to help me through while Bordel refused. I only accepted when the Troll mentioned to the Cleric that the tea helped answer questions we might have, “For surely you have many.”\n\nThe hot, herbal, liquid made it’s way over my tongue and down my throat, Kimaris taking a moment to surprise me. “Boo!” he shouted unexpectedly. I think I sputtered, but that moment of surprise was all but forgotten as my vision became clouded. \n\nI heard my father’s voice first- or at least, I thought he was my father. I’m not sure. Theedain was shouting at Laeni, hurt with betrayal that she had taken Lord Remus Trophe as a lover. I looked on at the amber eyes that were mixed with remorse and pride. I saw myself too. My mother had to have been late twenties at this time, but it was no doubt I was her daughter. My own stubbornness was definitely inherited from her.\n\nStill, my chest clenched as I realized the man I loved wasn’t my own blood. Another fault against my mother and her ‘righteous’ ways. \n\nIt took me a few moments to unclutter my mind and think clearly. It didn’t make sense why I was seeing the scene replay before me. I had no questions or doubts about my parents. And so I wonder if there’s any truth to it or if it was just a nightmare to confuse me until Rora came to pull me away.\n\nThe warrioress, the first manifestation of my cycle of Primordials, stood before me once more in the glorious robes and headdress.\n\n“Hello again,” Rora greeted. She was warmer than I remembered her being in the vision. I wiped at my eyes and looked at her, wanting to hate her, yet wanting nothing more than to be held.\n\n“What do you want?” I asked.\n\n“To help you understand your potential.”\n\n“Don’t,” was what I wanted to say, but I bit my tongue as I knew what was to come. Rora reminded me of the previous days, about how I failed to be of any use because I withheld my Lyro Blade from the fight. “Sometimes you have to fight back to protect those you love,” she said. \n\n“You don’t think I know that!?” I seethed. I was losing control and bitterly I wanted to remain stoic. The warrioress looked at me appraisingly. Her green eyes were outlined in red and after a long pause informed me that I had been conditioned for sixteen years of my life in the ways of Heironious.\n\n“And that has made me weak...” I stated.\n\n“No. It has given you a keen sense of what good and kindness is. All you need to do now is learn to balance that purity with your duty to protect.”\nI shook my head, her words were poison to my soul. My lips trembled as I answered, “Rora. I can’t.”\n\nWith optimism that pushed me beyond my own patience, the warrioress stated that someday I would. “Do you not understand!?” I snapped, “To harm another person, let alone take a life, is my BANE! Rationally, as a Primordial, I know I could. But as those situations arose, this body, this mortal and inferior BODY, filled with such dread! I don’t know if there’s enough time in this life to prepare me to fight with the sword. Maybe I’m not cut out for this and I ought to die!”\n\nThe woman before me shook her head. Then with softness I was not expecting said, “No. I promise, you are probably the most perfect this cycle has seen. Just be patient.” And with that, Rora tossed my Lyro Blade at me. Instinctively I reached out and caught it. It felt natural, like the way I hold my pen or lyre. This weapon was something I’ve always known.\n\nThe warrioress then took my hand. I felt her fill my body and could see her life. There was great comfort and joy as my Primordial self communed with the familiar memories and understanding. For a moment there was hope. I didn’t want to leave, but soon my body called my spirit back.\n\nAs I came to, the insecurities, rife in my body, took hold as I found myself among mortals again. The anger that erupted, as my flesh recognized that it was losing the fight to my spirit, was most bitter. Those feelings that Rora imparted upon me were forgotten as I fed off the energy that loathed the idea of elevating to my potential.\n\nI threw my cup across the room, it shattering into hundreds of pieces. Quickly I left the table and stormed out of the hut, not caring what offence or embarrassment I created. \n\nOutside I paced, took deep breathes of the awful swamp air, and leaned against the hut. Zaren came storming out a few minutes later in a great bout of distress. I almost didn’t recognize it to be him for his hands were claw like and his auburn hair was longer. In my anger I asked if he had a foul dream too, though my language was far from lady like in that instance. He agreed, wiping his face.\n\nWith his emotions high, mine dissipated. My heart took over, ending my pity party. Probably the only good quality I have left: caring. I gently asked about the changes I saw and Zaren explained it was part of being a Shifter. I questioned if ‘Aragoth’ was just a disguise then. He mentioned it was a past manifestation. The Wizard continued to sob in spite of my pestering. I walked up to him and held a hand out stating, “I like this version of you better.”\n\nWe stood holding hands for some time, Zaren stating I was a good friend. He made mention of my dream, apologizing that it was bad. I shrugged and brushed it off stating, “I should have expected such. I long for the day in which I’m at peace with myself again.”\n\nThat was certainly the most endearing moment today. It pricks at my heart despite the gloom that rests upon my shoulders.\n\nAfter that stop at the Hermits, we had only one other hiccup- well two, but this one took a large chunk of our time away. We encountered two Hill Giants who made a big fuss over their nets being broken and how we weren’t allowed passage due to being hungry. Bordel ended up fixing their nets and was given an added payment of appreciation. The Cleric was handed a choker with seven spheres upon it. Zaren examined it closely and determined that it would provide us with the ability to teleport in the future. We leave a sphere at a destination, then no matter where we are, as long as we hold on to whoever is wearing the choker, we can teleport to the place.\n\nThough the bit with the Hill Giants took roughly two hours off our travel time, we managed to get out of the swamp. And that’s saying something because as we came within a half mile to the edge, a growl danced across the landscape. Not wanting to fight, I picked up my skirt and began to jog. Daevri liked the idea and encouraged the others to follow suit.\n\nThe sound continued and I looked about to behold a large, black, bird like creature lunging toward me! It had three feet and claw like fingers that stretched out from under it’s wings. I positioned my hands and muttered the words to a fear spell, sending it toward the fowl.\n\nIt did nothing to the creature and soon I stumbled as I found the beast upon me. The bird’s hand seized my neck and held me high shouting, “POLLY WANTS A CRACKER!!!” I dangled for a few moments, trying to catch my breath. Not wanting to loosen my grip on the hand that bound my neck, I feverishly searched my mind as to what I should do. It wanted a cracker. Carefully, with one hand, I motioned in the air and barely uttered, “Sriver,” to create an illusion of a cracker.\n\nThe bird aggressively ate the imaginary food and thanked me. It then set me down roughly and with a loud squawk ran off again. I coughed and sputtered and clutched my bleeding hand as I took in deep breathes. \n\n“Are you alright?” Bordel asked. *No!* I thought, but managed to say I was fine. I looked at them all, standing about, looking at me with stupid expressions. No one had reacted... The minute or two I was being strangled... no one helped. And I have to wonder if it’s because I’ve refused to fight. Perhaps they loathe my pacifist ways. \n\nI want to cry under this pressure. Maybe I should have died yesterday... I am of no use. I sincerely doubt there’s any hope for me. I just feel so alone and a burden.\n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n\n\n~Based (90%) on the song, Castle, by Halsey~\n\n\nDone with all these people talking. \nSick of all this noise.\nTired of all these mem’ries flashing. \nFed with being poised.\nOh, of all these minutes passing, sick of feeling used.\nDoubt these walls will ever break down, ‘less risk being bruised.\nNow my neck is open wide begging for a fist around it.\nAlready choking on my pride, so there’s no use crying about it.\n\n\nI’m headed straight for the mountain.\nThey want to see these hands bleed.\nAnd there’s a woman placing in my hand\nMy weapon saying, “Sometimes you need to be mean.”\nI’m heading straight for the mountain.\nThey’re slowly locking me up\nAnd there’s a woman weighing on my mind\nNow saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut.\nStraight for the mountain.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a cult.\n\nA cult of Duergar, the shadowy, cruel dwarves of the underdark. And for the longest time, they had a religion, based all around imprisoning a dark god. But now, they were a cult, that worshipped this god, and exalted in its freedom and uprising.\n\nEnter the mesmerist, [Roger Harlen](http://i.imgur.com/VBh5Oh3.png), kindly old gent and the hand of british imperialism. He was part of a team tasked with securing the assistance of these Duergar with some diplomatic issue or other. And while the Duergar were willing to cooperate, after some clever fast-talk, there remained the issue of the cult. Roger did not like this cult. Nor did his team. So they all decided- this cult would have to be dismantled, and old religion restored.\n\nIt would not be easy, but there were some tools at hand. One of the team, a Duergar named Healer, was an old resident of this place that had ran away. His father was the old chieftan, who had been overthrown and imprisoned. And his father still had political allies. Roger quickly installed himself as the planner, directing events from the safehouse, monitering everyone and giving out commands. Between his crack team and the political allies, he had a great many things to arrange. And arrange he did.\n\nPenny and Gwen, the bright young monk and idealistic fighter, made a great show of purchasing a large number of human slaves in the name of Healer. Outwardly, it appeared that Healer was putting down roots and reestablishing a home, while inwardly, the slaves were to be hidden away from their captors and quietly released. Healer himself would make overtures about being convinced of this new cult, and wanting to join and be a powerful ally, while marking down the history of the cult, its structure, and its weaknesses.Tora and Hemlock, the sneaky cat- and fox- people, went about stealing official items and forging some very incriminating letters.\n\nAll that was left was to move the last few pawns...\n\nFirst, the cult chieftan. Roger posed as Healer's servant, as Healer went off to claim his willingness to serve the new cult and its dark god. Roger, through the use of trickery and Sow Thought, planted an idea in the cult chieftan's head: If Healer wanted to prove his loyalty, he should be given a trial. And the trial? To sever his ties with the old Duergar regime, by severing the head of its old chieftan- Healer's father. A plan that would show the unwavering support of a powerful, wealthy new ally, demonstrate the fearsomeness of the new cult, and quash any remaining rebellion. Or so he thought. Meanwhile, Roger primed a young, unsure clergyman with a few spells that made him start to question the cult chieftan's motives... and then, at just the right time, slipped him a doctored letter that Hemlock had forged, incriminating the cultists and showing (fabricated) evidence of an impending genocide.\n\nCheck.\n\nThe entire cavern gathered up for the public execution of Healer's father. No Duergar would miss this event. And as Healer and the cult chieftan stepped onto the raised platform, the young cultist rushed forward to level his accusations! Right on schedule. And while the cultist brandished his 'proof', Roger made certain that he would be heard- by trapping the cult chieftan in an extended [Deja Vu](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deja-vu) (no saving throw).\n\nCULT CHIEF: \"How DARE you talk to me like that!\"\n\nYOUNG CULTIST: \"I dare, chieftan, because I have no choice! Look! This letter bearing your personal seal, sending for Duergar-bane weapons!\"\n\n\"How DARE you talk to me like that!\"\n\n\"Uh. It's clear that this cult is planning a genocide! A slaughter of our people!\"\n\n\"How DARE you talk to me like that!\"\n\n\"Are you alright?\"\n\n\"How DARE you talk to me like that!\"\n\nAt this point, Roger immediately recast the spell, while Healer broke his father out of his restraints.\n\nYOUNG CULTIST: \"...It's clear that you are an unfit leader, chieftan! Your crazed ideas will bring about the end of us all!\"\n\nCULT CHIEF: \"Wait, what just happened?\"\n\nHEALER: \"Yes, and my father would never have allowed such things. Under his rule, Duergar prospered!\"\n\n\"Wait, what just happened?\"\n\nHEALER'S FATHER: \"This so-called Dark God is no more than a manipulator and a murderer! He must be sealed away once more!\"\n\n\"Wait, what just happened?\"\n\nHEALER'S FATHER: \"These cultists will lead you only to ruin and madness! Rise up, my people, and throw off the shackles of this false god!\"\n\n\"Wait, what just happened?\"\n\nHEALER'S FATHER: \"Starting with this buffoon!\"\n\nAt this point, Hemlock casted Hold Person on the cult chief. Roger used Enthrall to make sure everyone heard a lovely, rousing speech, and all of the cult loyalists were helpless to react as public opinion turned against them. Roger released the spell, and the Duergar surged forward toward the still-paralyzed cult chieftan. And, just for good measure, Roger cast one final spell: [Pants](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/rite-publishing---3rd-party-spells/p/pants).\n\nAnd that's how the all-powerful cult leader went from all-powerful leader of his people, conduit of his dark god and the most feared man in the underdark, to a gibbering, crazed idiot paralyzed by fear, indecision, and unfastened pants in the space of five minutes.\n\nCheckmate.\n\nOf course, the rest of the party still had to deal with the absolutely infuriated Dark God, but that was for all the strapping young gents with the swords and the guns...",

        "text": "Forgiving me r/GameTales. It has been three campaigns since my last confession. This is a GMing nightmare, and there's actually **[an accompanying comic over here](http://www.handbookofheroes.com/archives/comic/boring-origin-story)**. For those who don't want to click through, here's the story in full: \n\nTo quote [a truly great hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osCVUNDxhZQ), “Nobody wants to hear your boring fucking origin story.” I did not always possess this wisdom, and so subjected my players to what may be my worst ever GM moment. Story time, kids!\n\nIt was the Jade Regent adventure path, which contains a Dragon Age style relationship mini-game. Players pick one of four NPCs to form either a romance/bromance or a rivalry with. There’s numerical attitude tracking, gift-giving, mechanical boons for nurturing the relationship…the whole bit. It’s a fun idea, but I hadn’t realized that the whole adventure path was something of a sequel to Rise of the Runelords. That means that two of the four very important NPCs (which stick with you for the whole campaign) were actually introduced outside of the Jade Regent story line. One of them was an elven ranger named Shalelu. She was to be my downfall. There just didn’t seem to be a way to work her into the story, and so finally I got out my narrative crowbar and tried to wedge her in.\n\nSo there they were, sitting around a campfire with their NPCs. It’s raining out, but there aren’t any hill giants attacking or cart horses getting spooked, and my players are like, “Why is this even a scene?” That’s when I launch into this awful exposition about how gray and dismal it is, and how Shalelu is staring into the fire like the loneliest lone wolf to ever lone a wolf. “I hate the rain,” she says.\n\nMy players make no response. The badass elven ranger is monologuing. What is there to say?\n\n“I was a girl, not more than ten when we found the body. My father’s body. It was raining that day.”\n\nI realize at this point that I’ve turned the hot elf chick into a socially awkward weirdo, but I’ve already started. There’s no choice but to get to the end of the scene. Shalelu goes on and on about how they found her father’s mangled body, how they tracked the murderous bugbears down, and how she hates goblinoids to this day.\n\n“And the rain,” she concludes. “I still hate the rain.”\n\nMy players are sitting there meanwhile like, how in the crap are we supposed to interact with this scene? It had come out of nowhere. There was no lead-up. This was supposed to be the beginning of this NCP’s characterization. One of my players actually did the awkward turtle thing with her hands.\n\nThe campaign died shortly thereafter. If memory serves, it had something to do with not liking how the NPCs seemed more central to the story than the players’ characters. Can’t imagine how they got that impression. Any dang way, that’s not the end of the story. Years later, one of my Jade Regent players decided to run Rise of the Runelords. If you’ll recall, that’s the adventure path that introduced Shalelu. Every time she speaks, it’s to remark on how something reminds her of a tragic event from her past. The burning of the sacred oven tree [[in the comic](http://www.handbookofheroes.com/archives/comic/boring-origin-story)] was one of those stories. My shame knows no bounds. ",

        "text": "Last night we were playing one of the parts of the 5e Starter Set. Going after a group of mercenaries, our rogue decided to leap into the room to get around someone in the way. She rolled a 1 and tripped spilling all of her money to the floor. The next round she tried to shoot an arrow at one of them. She rolled a 1 again and the arrow bounced off of our fighter's helmet and into a barrel spilling all the wine out of it onto the floor. So now her money is just sticky and covered in wine. Later on we needed to take a short rest so she went back to the cistern in the area to clean off her money and remove the stickiness on it. While there she stumbled on a bag with a couple of potions, come clothes, and cash. She hauled it in and took it back to the group.\n\nLater in the evening, we find the wizard has ran off. Our fighter gives chase hoping to find him before he escaped. He gets back to the front of the manor only to find the wizard searching desperately for his go bag hidden in the cistern. Likely, had she not fumbled those rolls earlier, we never would have found the bag, he would have ducked out, and we'd have no more leads on the story. Instead, we've got a couple nice potions, some cash, and a hog tied wizard captive who has some explaining to do.",

        "text": "This is a continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4lrfny/35e_the_second_battle_of_cox_and_a_tragic_death/)\n\nToday's story begins after Fort Cox was taken by rebel forces. There was a guard officer who we captured and began interrogating. Eventually, using charm person to charm the guard, Coraim found out there are no important patrols or supply lines near the fort. Also, since it's now a running joke that when Coraim uses charm person the person he uses it on thinks he's Jerry Seinfeld, he decided to do a short Seinfeld style comedy routine, which went something like this: \"what's the deal with dragons, no one wants you to have relations with them, but they're just so damn sexy! Am I right people?\". Not long later, Vito found a note requesting supplies and troops, signed by the officer... and the officer had the same last name as Vito. Vito asked the guard who his father was, and it was the same person as his father, eventually he found out they had different mothers, so the guard and Vito were half brothers. Vito tried to convince the guard that he was his half brother, and that their father was still alive (since the guard thought he was dead), but it became clear that it was going nowhere, so Coraim and Lexter went off to recruit troops in a nearby town while Felosial (Elf cleric for a new player), Vito and Iaghar stayed behind to rebuild the fort. Also the party found a stash of gems and gold in the fort, which Coraim wanted to burn because he has an obsession with fire.\n\nThe ride to the town was uneventful, but when Coraim and Lexter arrived they noticed a large group of the townsfolk were working on building a wall around the perimeter of the town. Coraim reasoned that laborers were the perfect soldiers for the rebellion, oppressed by the king and able-bodied, so he told Lexter to hold him up so he wouldn't seem short, yelling \"HOLD ME UP SO I CAN YELL AT PEOPLE YOU ASSHOLE!\", and eventually settled for standing on a rock, an began to give his speech. Everyone ignored Coraim's speech entirely, and even when he tried to go up and talk to someone they didn't respond. At this point it was clear there was another [Lotus Flower Tavern](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4i3c3s/the_disapearing_tavern/) going on, and Coraim and Lexter decided to investigate. It seemed the tavern would be a good place to start, but when they got there everybody was working on building things, no drinking at all. At this point both Coraim and Lexter were pretty freaked out, and began to leave the town, but someone stopped them, asking where they were going, and Coraim said they were just going out to get wood for the wall and would come back, but as soon as they walked away the man that stopped them tried to knock them out with a stick, but was stopped by a man shouting that Coraim and Lexter are with him from a tower.\n\nOur heroes went up to the tower, having no other choice at this point, and Coraim began to ask why the man was mind controlling this town, while Lexter stayed at the bottom of the stairs, waiting to run if things went afoul. The man said he was not the one controlling the town, but he was trying to stop those who were, he asked why they came to this town, and they explained the rebellion, and he asked if they had allies, and Coraim listed the rest of the party, and the man said he could teleport them to where the tower (at this point it was clear he was a powerful wizard) and Coraim used the message spell to warn Felosial they were about to be teleported, though it would be more funny without warning. Iaghar was in the outhouse when the teleportation happened (yes, [that outhouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4j9j3k/dd_35e_the_battle_of_cox_and_the_exploding/)), so he pissed on Vito some before pulling his armor up. The wizard then handed Coraim a sack and told him to open it. Suddenly, the party heard heavy boots coming up the stairs, and the wizard told them to hide in the closet, multiple stupid jokes about being in the closet were made because of course they were, and then we heard the door open, the wizard was talking with someone, and then... mooing? They heard a loud moo and then a scream, and then the people leaving. When they left the closet we found... yak fur on the ground (Lexter recognized it, being a former farmer), and hoof marks, and the wizard was dead.\n\nThe wizard was wearing rags, and once the party saw his corpse a tower of the rags he was wearing began swirling around him in a humanoid shape, and whispered the words \"the lens, use the lens\". Coraim looked in the sack and found a small lens, which he used to look out the window, and when he looked at any adult in the town through it they still had their normal form, but enveloping them was an ethereal form... of a yak. Well, more of a Minotaur, but instead of a human-cow hybrid it was a human-yak hybrid. Also, Felosial infected one of the guards with lower respiratory infections at one point because we didn't realize contagion only lets you infect people with diseases from a table, oh well, it was funny.",

        "text": "A couple years ago, between the time when people played EverQuest II and when people stopped playing EverQuest II, I stumbled upon the game in Steam when I was looking for a good MMO to get myself into. I had finally installed all the updates and patches, and made my character, a Human Brigand by the name of Ollerus. I started out in Hate's Envy, where some players who chose the bad guy path start out, and I continued to work my way up through the levels, just as any normal character would. It seemed to be going pretty well, and everything was normal, until I got an invite from a random player.\n\nI can't quite remember his in-game name, so I'll just call him Hoxton (Payday reference). Hoxton sent me, a low level noob, a request to join his party of one. I told him I'd rather go into the game at my own pace, but he insisted I join him. I eventually gave in, and started following him to wherever he guided me. He brought me into the next area, a little too high level for me, but I could manage. Eventually, we arrive at the great city of Freeport, a dazzling city built of black brick. I was still struggling to grasp the situation, wondering all this time \"What the Hell is going on? Who the heck is this guy?\" all while following along to see how this progresses.\n\nWhen we enter the gates of Freeport, we instantly go to the marketplace. Hoxton gifts me a generous 20 plat and tells me to buy a mount. I buy a cheap horse that will get me around places I need to go, and he tells me to keep the rest of the money, a very very kind offer. We then spend a couple hours leveling up my character, doing quests and raids, until I reach the level 20 milestone. I start to get to know Hoxton better, he seems like a really nice guy who had dedicated a lot of time to the game. He says he's wasted a lot of money from his grandma's credit card too, which makes me a bit sad but I still thought it was kinda funny.\n\nAfter a while, he says he trusts me enough to join his guild. This was all in one day, and I was stunned that I rose through the ranks this fast! I'd never make it this far in any other game on the first day. He gives me a tour of the guild hall and this place was packed; it was humongous, and there wasn't a single room that wasn't loaded with items. He also introduced me to the members that were online, including one of the two leaders, a female dark elf who I won't even bother try naming. I talked with her a bunch, and she was definitely the role-playing type. It was hard getting any info on her life outside of the game, but from what I understood she had a fiance that was the other leader of the guild, and the two ran it together. I thought that was pretty sweet, but I didn't know if they were actually getting married in real life.\n\nAfter a while, Hoxton tells me he has to go offline for a bit, and that he'd be back in a little while. I keep talking to the leader of the guild, when her fiance comes online. He storms through the guild hall, loaded with armour on a flaming Pegasus, into the throne room where me and his soon-to-be wife are. We all start talking about things no one cares about, when the fiance makes note of a stolen item in the court yard, and says he suspects that Hoxton took it. He said he never trusted Hoxton, and that he shouldn't have invited him, and goes offline to report Hoxton.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm still trying to figure out what the *FUCK* is going on. This was all super confusing to me, and I was just waiting to find out what happens next. That's when Hoxton logs back on.\n\nHe's greeted with the leader yelling at him for stealing the item, to which he admits that he did. I kinda felt bad for the guy, stealing his grandma's money to pay for the game, and wasting countless hours just to possibly get banned for theft. The fiance logs back on and heads over where we all are, in the courtyard. He says that Hoxton will get a permanent ban for stealing the item, as it's priced at an extremely high value. He nobly accepts his defeat, but has one final request: that he could have my steam id so he could add me. At this point, I felt really bad. He'd have to leave behind everything he's worked for, the least I could do was befriend him.\n\nHe instantly messages me on steam asking if I was Ollerus from the game. I reply \"Yeah it's me, and I'm really sorry you lost your account\". He simply says, to my surprise, \"No worries, watch this. Go back into the game.\"\n\nI go back into the game to see what he means, when Hoxton messages \"Ollerus. Run.\" Just as he says that, one by one, every item in the guild hall starts to disappear. I listen to his advice and run for the door. The fiance logs off immediately, and the leader starts typing \"WHAT THE FUCK\" over and over again in chat. Literally every item in the guild hall disappears. Hoxton messages me on steam and tells me to block the leader and leave the guild, and I do. I keep asking him what the heck just happened. It turns out, the lady's fiance was Hoxton's alt all along, and that he was only in it to steal the items.\n\nI had mixed feelings about the whole situation, but Hoxton was ecstatic about it. He gave me half of the items that he stole from the guild hall, and even though I felt guilty, I accepted them. He said that he had the fiance act as a diversion so the leader wouldn't report him, and since he could give his account he was playing with me on the ability to store items, she couldn't report her own fiance since he never did anything. A truly well thought out and time consuming plan. Brilliant, but harsh. In the end I occasionally go back to EverQuest II, just to see how things are keeping up. Hoxton doesn't play much anymore, and I haven't spoken to him in a while. I don't think playing the game again will ever give me the same intense feeling I felt when Hoxton told me to run. I don't think any game will.",

Eventually the other half of the party found, and the Dwarf, being a knight, isn't allowed to fight without the enemy knowing where he is. So he shouts. In a cave. Where we're trying to sneak. That goes amazing for my team in the end, as we had found a choke point and just killed the Orcs one by one as the rushed to what they thought was the only invader. Turns out, the leader of the Orcs was down our branch. He, unlike the other Orcs, was wearing metal. Fun fact about Duskblades: they can channel certain spells through a weapon. One such spell is Shocking Grasp, which gets +3 to hit if the target is wearing metal. And deals 5d6 dmg in addition to the d8 from the sword, and any bonuses from any other stats... Needless to say, it was a short fight. As the boss rounded the corner, I stabbed him in the chest and dealt a good 40 points of damage, leaving him at what may as well have been 1 hp. The Barbarian then smashed what was left of his head in, and we went on to flush out the remaining Orcs. All of this, even after being found, in the dark.

        "text": "For those that do not know, Dayz is a zombie survival game where the goal is to gather as much PHAT LEWTZ as possible, while interacting with fellow online psychotic survivors, most of them hostile.  Often, the zombies pose much less of a threat than other players, exemplifying the trope of \"humans are the real monsters\"\n\nMy tale starts with me, a poorly geared survivor, among dozens of others scattered across a vaguely Ukrainian landscape, more specifically near Balota Airfield.  The airfields in this game are prime centers for military-grade loot, like AK rifles, ammo, backpacks and bulletproof vests.  I am wearing a blue ensemble, blue cargo pants with a blue checkered lumberjack shirt and a police vest with PRESS emblazoned on the front.  Now, while this may not be the best camo, rarely do I ever go for such camo, preferring the interactions with the other players to being a solitary Sally.  I was by myself for the time being, none of my friends online, and I made the decision to loot the airfield solo, a terrible mistake to make.  A couple hangers, nothing eventful, but not much loot.  Shit.  While loot does respawn in the game, it takes a rather long while to do so, and other players must have already cleared out the airfield.  \n\nAll of a sudden, as I go into a hanger to get a backpack I saw from the outside, a vaguely Australian-sounding voice yells out \"GET ON THE GROUND!\"  Being armed with only a concealed M1911 with only 7 rounds, I comply.  Another player was hiding in the 'lip' formed by the edge of the hanger doors and the wall, concealing him from the outside.  He points a long gun at me, some kind of hunting rifle.  He asks if I have any friends with me.  Replying in the negative, he asks if I needed food or water.  It was at this point that I realized I stumbled upon a friendly player, bringing relief to my adrenaline filled heart.  He gives me a can of soda and a box of rice, and we eat for a while in the hanger together, shooting the shit about how slow the game's development is going and how there never is any loot to find.  A third player comes in, in a motorcycle jacket and helmet with a lumberjack's axe on his back.  'Biker', as I'll call him, sits down with us and joins the conversation, luckily not trying to brutally axe murder us.  This picnic was going rather well, and we were laughing and telling jokes to each other, good fun.  Aussie decides to get a fire going to cook some meat he had on him, and steps out of the hanger.\n\nWhip-Crack!  Whip Crack!\n\nTwo gunshots, with a suppressed muzzle report whiz by, one hitting the Aussie's legs.  He crawls back into the hanger, and we collectively shit ourselves.  Aussie bandages and draws his rifle, while he asked us what weapons we had.  I pull my up-to-now concealed M1911, and tell him I have 7 pistol shots.  Biker draws his axe and exclaims that he does not have a gun.  We were pinned in a hanger by an unknown number of bandits, and they were armed with at least 1 suppressed semi auto rifle.  Aussie says that since we cannot defend with only 2 guns and almost no ammo, that we should make a break for it.  Biker agrees, and we start serpentine running our way out of the hanger, headed for a nearby town to hide.  That was not a smart move, us discussing where to go in the open.  We reach the end of the airfield, and make a break for the trees of the nearby forest.  \n\nWhip Crack!  Whip Crack! Whip Crack!\n\nGunfire, I hear a yell, biker is down.  he is bleeding, and there is nothing we can do, to the face-down man bleeding through the leather jacket that could withstand a motorcycle crash, but not a barrage of 7.62 x 39 mm rounds.  Aussie and I escape, and come to the town.  Nobody there, just a bunch of grey apartment buildings and burnt-out cars.  Aussie says that he wants to go to the big city to the east, Chernogorsk, while I plan to head north for the 20 minute hike to the Northwest Airfield, the biggest of al the airfields.  We go our separate ways, after discussing it for a while.  My heart was beginning to come down off of the endorphin and adrenaline rush that had flooded it five minutes earlier, and I began to feel more confident that I survived.\n\nWhip-Crack! BLAM! Whip Crack! Whip Crack! Whip Crack!\n\nAt this point, I was not longer afraid, I had to see if Aussie survived.  I headed towards the gunshots, against the screaming of my head, screaming \"NO! Leave him!\".  I still had 7 shots left. I could still win this.  \n\nI arrive to where the gunshots were.  There is no sound, the birds are silent.  Surprisingly, no zombies were attracted by the noise, but I knew it would not be long until they were.  A burnt out city bus lay across the side of the road, and in it I could see someone with a red backpack, crouched down behind a seat.  The Aussie lay on the ground, his clothes and hat ruined, with a hunting rifle next to him.  Blood still spouted from his head and chest, staining his shirt and the ground beside him.  Another player walks up to me, from where Aussie lay.  They were wearing military clothing, a vest and helmet with some camo pants and shirt.  They did not have a weapon, but out of the corner of my eye I could see that the mysterious man on the bus pulled a rifle, but was not aiming it.  Maneuvering behind the milsurp man so the man on the bus could not get a clear shot without risking his buddy. I said \"hello\", which was responded to by the milsurp man saying \"good to see you\".  I was calm, but the adrenaline was beginning to kick back in.  I was scared but resolute, and I was sorry that the day turned out so bad for the strangers I met just because of a picnic and conversation.  I drew my concealed M1911.  Seven shots, more than enough.  The sun was high overhead, there was no sound.  Everything was calm.  I was at peace.\n\nBlam! Blam! Blam! Whip Crack! Whip Crack! Whip Crack! Whip Crack!",

        "text": "Ever feel like something is missing from modern videogames? Sometimes it seems like we are playing commercials; games that are built around a 5 minute cinematic trailer, designed to tempt a bored gamer into making a purchase. The first hour of gameplay entices us with immersion into a new world, but there is little depth. We are quickly bored by the same cookie-cutter core gameplay mechanics that the developer has cloned to create their own unique take on the most successful game in their genre.\n\nToday I am sharing a glimpse into a game that has clunky controls and crude graphics, but boasts an extreme level of depth in it's gameplay. The game has been around for years and there is hardly anything like it. This game doesn't really fit into a genre, but it could best be described as a multiplayer role-play. The game I am writing about today is Space Station 13. It takes place on a space station crewed by a dysfunctional online community. The story that follows is pretty much an exact account of an amazing round that happened while I was playing on GoonStation. Keep in mind, all the characters in this recap are other players and I am not dramatizing any of the events. This is just a recap of the gameplay as it really happened.\n\n**My First and Final Moments as Captain**\n\nThe round starts and I am the Captain of the station. I grab some equipment from the locker in my quarters, and change into my fancy dress uniform. I switch my energy gun from stun to kill and holster it in my belt, then head out into the bridge. I make my way over to customs to handle any access requests from unsatisfied crew members. A scientist approaches the desk and asks for 'all-access' so he can hunt down welding fuel containers on the station for research. I tell him to fuck off, but decide to give him access to the maintenance tunnels because most people have that basic level of access anyway. He thanks me and scurries off. A Centcom Official shows up and passes through the security door to my area. I throw him a quick salute. Suddenly a Wizard appears in the hallway on the other side of the desk from me. I quickly beat a retreat into the bridge shouting 'WIZARD!!' over the comms to alert the crew and scramble security into action. Trying to act fast while I still have momentum, I tear my energy gun from its holster and charge back through customs and into the hallway. The Wizard appears next to me and I fire wildly at him. I don't think the Wizard had any hostile intentions, he was taken completely by surprise. He manages to fire back though, grazing me with a bolt of some sort of ice magick. The Centcom Official arrives at the scene to find the Wizard on the ground wounded, and me slowly crawling towards him to finish him off, despide being impeded by the chilling affects of the cold spell. The Centcom Official runs past me and drags the injured Wizard into security. I limp after them, slowly regaining my mobility as the chill wears off. I show up in security to find the Centcom Official alone. Apparently the Wizard was able to escape him somehow. I berate the Centcom Official for letting him escape. The Wizard announces over comms that he was a friendly Wizard, but now he demands blood after being attacked by the Captain unprovoked. He declares that he will start butchering people. The Centcom Official and I hatch a daring plan that might save the crew from a magickal rampage. He confiscates all my items and I change into a prison jumpsuit. The Centcom Official announces over comms that he has officially revoked my status as Captain. He locks me in the brig and pleads for the Wizard not to kill anyone, pointing out that I have been stripped of my rank and jailed for my crimes.\n\n**Showdown at the Brig**\n\nAs I essentially wait for death, one of the quartermasters happens to pass by the reinforced glass wall between genpop and the main hallway. He sees me through the glass and starts yelling, demanding that I be freed. The quartermaster then disappears to the south out of my view, I hear the sounds of someone hitting reinforced glass with a fire extinguisher. The Wizard shows up in the brig and summons a golem made of vodka. He sends the monstrosity into genpop with me and watches as I run in circles, helplessly being chased. The Centcom Official leaves me for dead, exiting the brig and walking out of security. The Wizard grows tired of my success at evading the golem and decides to step in. He teleports into genpop and hits me with another ice spell to slow me down. The golem catches up to me and starts beating me without mercy. I collapse to the ground and the Wizard joins in, hitting me repeatedly with his staff of C'Thulu. I black out during the assault, now in critical condition.\n\n**A Daring Rescue**\n\nI awaken to the sound of breaking glass. The quartermaster smashes through the reinforced glass window between the brig and genpop. Against all odds, he sprints over to the scene of the beatdown and grabs me. Before the Wizard can react, the quartermaster drags me out of genpop into the brig. He rushes over towards the smashed window where he broke into security from the hallway so that we can escape. However, he stumbles into a locker and accidentally pushes it in the way, blocking our exit. The Wizard is hot on his tail, golem too. Thinking quickly, the quartermaster makes a break for the security docking bay with me still in tow. I am back on my feet, but am severely injured and on the verge of collapse. Going in and out of critical condition has placed a huge strain on my heart, I can't take much more and I figure I won't make it. The quartermaster drags me over to one of the security pods and hops in the pilot seat. He opens the bay doors as I crawl into the passenger seat with my last bit of strength. The Wizard arrives in the docking bay, casting ice magick widly in our direction. The quarter master punches it, burning his way out of the pod bay and into space, evading the fireworks show of magick spraying out of the airlock behind us. I black out again. The quartermaster flies the pod over to the outer northwest podbay and re-docks us. He pulls me out of the pod and drags me down to medbay. I am now in the final stages of cardiac arrest, but I regain consciousness when somebody defibrillates me. The quartermaster debates with a medical doctor over how to treat me so that I won't die from heart failure. They finally stabilize me. My heart lurches in my chest but the quartermaster and the doctor assure me that the symptoms will subside and I will pull through. I discard my prison uniform. Over the comms, the Centcom Official is working to placate the Wizard; who is now setting up a dictatorship on the bridge, daring anyone to challenge his rule. The Centcom Official points out that nobody else has to die. His argument hinges on the logic that the Wizard, having killed the former Captain, can revert to being a peaceful Wizard again because justice had been served.\n\n**On the Lamb**\n\nThe Wizard starts executing random people, while the Centcom Official tries to parlay with him in vain. The Centcom Official backpedals into agreeing that the non-essential personnel can be killed, he is desperately trying to maintain a dialog with the bloodthirsty mage. Dissent quietly starts to spread among the crew, everyone suspects that the Wizard will just kill people off one by one until nobody is left who can challenge him. The quartermaster leads me up to one of the equipment rooms on the north side of the station. He hands me a backpack and a welding mask to carry items and hide my identity respectively. I thank the man for everything he has done for me and ask him why he decided to rescue me. The quartermaster explains, he was bored so he figured he might as well. I nod, throw him a salute, and run off nakedly down the hallway to find some clothes. With no ID card, I can't access most doors and am really only able to get into the common areas of the station. I manage to get into a locker room adjacent to the spa and I come out wearing a bathrobe and a pair of pink fuzzy slippers. With a bottle of Cap'n Bub's Extra-Manly Bubble Bath in my pocket and a loofah in one hand, I am not much of a threat to the Wizard. The welding mask impedes my vision and it looks extra bulky and obvious that I am trying to hide my face, so I rummage through the adjacent crew quarters in search for a better disguise. I find a horse mask. I trade up disguises, wrap a towel around my head to complete the ensemble, and take to the halls.\n\n**Rebellion**\n\nThe Wizard still continues to lord over the station from the bridge, executing people at random. Being Captain, I feel a sense of obligation to save my crew and prove that I am not like every incompetent useless Captain before me. I vow to overthrow the magickal tyrant and take back my station. I make my way to the southern portion of the station proper, then head into medbay to get scanned into the cloning machine. I find one of the Swedish doctors who helped aid me when I was in critical condition. I explain that I am going to challenge the Wizard, and need him to scan my DNA into the cloning machine in case things go poorly and I end up getting killed. He says something to me, I have no fucking idea what. His Swedish accent is just too thick. The Swedish doctor scans my DNA into the cloning machine and I thank him. Next I head to the forge area to scrounge for a weapon. There are lots of goodies back there and you don't need an ID card to get in. I don't find any weapons. Instead I find tools, so I take a screwdriver to one of the fabricators. I pull the access panel off it and hot-wire it using a multitool, so that it can print restricted items. I print out 3 sheets of metal, a staple gun, and 2 auto-loaders full of .38 stun ammo; then I fashion a zip-gun. I load my home-made firearm and stuff one auto-loader into my pocket for easy access. I toss the other auto-loader into my backpack so I don't get caught in a gun battle with no bullets. Holstering the zip-gun in the belt of my bathrobe, I take to the halls to hunt the Wizard. I do a lap around the station to find others running around with makeshift weaponry just like me, presumably for the same reason. I don't ask. While traveling through the west hallway, I slip and begin to careen down the hallway out of control. I get knocked on my ass when I slam into a reinforced table. I drop my loofah. Somebody coated the hallway in space lube. A doctor slips past me and crashes into an airlock door. Getting out of the treacherous hallway is like playing an ice level in Chip's Challenge. By the time I get out of there, I am really banged up from slamming into walls. Fortunately I am right near medbay, so I limp down there and get treated by the Swedish doctor. He says something with a heavy Swedish accent. I can't understand him at all. I thank him again and head back out, avoiding the west hallway. I meet up with 2 other armed men at the bar. I lift my horse mask to show them my face, then quickly put it back on. I explain that I am the former Captain who was assumed to have been killed and I am hunting the Wizard to take back command of the station, but I can't do it alone.\n\n**Battle at the Bar**\n\nBefore we can conspire, the Wizard materializes in the middle of the bar area. EVERYBODY panics and opens fire, including me. One of my .38 stun bullets hits the bastard, knocking him down and causing him to lose his grip on his staff. A stray taser bolt sails past the Wizard and electrocutes me causing me to drop my zipgun. I try to run over to the Wizard to grab his staff before he can recover, but the taser shock slows me down to a crawl. I throw my Cap'n Bub's Extra-Manly Bubble Bath at him out of desperation. It has no effect. One of the other rebels manages to get the staff, but before he can strip the evil mage; the Wizard recovers and teleports away. After recovering from the taser hit, I collect my zipgun. As I reload, I congratulate the other men on getting the staff. Without his staff, a Wizard's spellcasting is really limited. The battle ended in victory for the station rebels, and the Wizard had come out of it less powerful than before with no casualties from our side.\n\n**The Sun Never Sets in Space**\n\nWithout his staff, the Wizard loses his stranglehold on the station. He no longer has the bridge area in check. Somebody calls for the escape shuttle, I can only assume it is the Centcom Official taking advantage of the window of opportunity we had created. Myself and the other militants roam the halls hunting for the Wizard, but there is no trace of him. I find the Centcom Official on the hallway floor in handcuffs outside of customs. I pick him up and help him out of his restraints. I tell the Centcom Official that I know he did his best, given the circumstance and that he has my respect. He thanks me. We make our way to the escape shuttle, which had just docked with the station. I buckle in and a few minutes later we are off to Centcom. I look back, and sitting behind me is the quartermaster that saved my life. I throw him one last salute, we both made it. The round ends. The Wizard failed all of his objectives.",

        "text": "Welcome back to the Unorganized campaign.  Comtinuing on from this post.  https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4jtijw/dd_4e_the_unorganized_campaign_in_can_we_keep_him/\n\n\"Quick\" recap of, because there are a few of them to keep track of.\n\nKriv Oathbreaker (my character): LG Dragonborn Fighter. Banished from his island after failing to prevent an assassination attempt on his charge, who just so happened to be the prince, and next in line for the throne. Has a bit of an honor complex, and seems to act like the mother hen of his new \"family\".\n\nCretin: NG Half-siren Warden. A well meaning, but often clumsy sort. He was born with a pair of wings that don't work, which is a bit of a sore point for him. Doesn't know his true heritage. Has a tendency to roll poorly for combat and adventuring, but crits rolls that have to with mundane tasks.\n\nFerr: NG Human Ranger. The grouch of the group. Constantly butting heads with Cretin. Tends to act rashly, and has a bit of a temper. He means well, even if he doesn't quite know how to say it. Is played by the current DM during this story.\n\nCera Mageslayer: Mute CG Elf Rogue. The character who you should be worried of when you hear the words \"can I...\" Will flip off of anything/anyone, bust through walls to tackle people, and use anything she can get her hands on as a weapon. Not allowed near oars anymore without a proper target. Usually drunk, or looking for a drink.\n\nChar: TN Elf Druid. A flame druid from the sacred tribe of \"Virginia\", he was given a cursed torch which couldn't actually burn anything, and sent off to collect the sacred flames of his people that were scattered about the world. One of the only players whose plot-points are remembered/used throughout the islands. Holds on to the belief of preservation of nature through superior firepower. He's friendly, but also a bit awkward.\n\nZar: NG Halfing Rogue. Part of a secret organization of Rogues and Thieves who go after worse Rogues and Thieves, he is supplied with a vast information network, and a seemingly endless array of shuriken. Often overthinks things when the more compulsive members of the party have already screwed up his plans.\n\nHarg: Half-Orc Barbarian. Originally an NPC, another one of our friends who actually joined after I did. He joined the party after being (accidentally) broken out of jail. He was given a mysterious backstory, and an orc-hating complex after being picked up by the player. Also a frequent target of Ferr, who also hates orcs.\n\nAnd along with our NPC's\n\nYinn: A Dragonborn Child that the party kidnapped... rescued. She's often joked OOC that she will surpass the party and become the savior of all. Is doted on both IC and OOC by everyone.\n\nInu/Enu: An illiterate, belligerent Gnoll pirate, whose crew was mind controlled into mutiny. Was saved by the party, and is being used basically as a taxi service to island hop.\n\nBrainy: Unwaveringly loyal Kobold first mate to Inu, and the only member of Enu's crew to resist the mind control. Doesn't speak Common, and is often used as Inu's slave/punching bag.\n\nIsamora: dwarven ice sorc, and drinking buddy to Cera. Babysits Yinn when the party is out adventuring. Vehemently argues with Char as they get along about as well as... well, ice and fire.\n\nSo when we last left off, the crew had just been banished to the hold for wrecking Captain Inu's ship.  The original original party took the time to bring Kriv up to speed.\n\nBasically, they were after an evil sorcerer, with a penchant for mind control, who had stolen a sacred fire from Char's people to use as a weapon of mass destruction.  They had to stop him from destroying Bluffton, the starter town that the group had just come from.  A few moments of awkward silence later, the group decides maybe it's time to calm Enu down.  That means it's time to go over skill checks!\n\nCretin, being the diplomacy pony, decides to give it the first crack.  He goes up with a plan calm Inu down, rolls low and promptly gets chewed out and sent back underneath.  So we slowly come to the conclusion that, 'hey, he can't be so heartless as to refuse a child.'  How wrong we were.  She went up to beg for the captain's favor and good will.  The only thing the crew heard, though, was the captain barking out death threats at the child.\n\nWhen Yinn comes running back down, crying, Kriv decides enough is enough.  +10 to intimidate at level one,\n\n[I_got_dis.guys](http://giphy.com/gifs/dwayne-johnson-pu2xEm3yYWzJu)\n\nImmediately roll a 1\n\n[I_don't_got_dis.guys](http://giphy.com/gifs/things-johnson-moviepilotcom-XR3qHiEQCgi9G)\n\nAs I'm climbing the ladder, righteous indignation rising in my chest, a seagull decides that's the perfect time to drop its load.  Right in Kriv's eye.\n\nWhy is it always the eye?\n\nKriv roars out in pain and immediately topples over head over non-existent tail right back down the ladder.\n\nGM:  If it's any consolation, you can hear Inu laughing back up on deck.  It seems that you pain put him in a better mood.\n\nMe:  [Greaaaat!](http://giphy.com/gifs/smile-supernatural-qECS7IBgg7uLu)\n\nA small journey of getting to know each other later, our adventurers come to the river outlet that they were looking for.  The only problem is that it appears to be blocked up.\n\nIt's clear that something, or rather, someone, has blocked up the river.  Nobody was sure whether it was to keep people out, or something in.\n\nEnu:  It looks like this is where we take our leave.\n\nOh no, we're not losing our taxi so soon.  Char and Isamora take turns trying to melt and freeze the rocks, each trying to outdo the other.  They have little effect on the pile.  It's deemed that the man-made dam is too large to dismantle by hand in the time frame we're working on.\n\nInu:  Well... I guess, It's time for us... to take, our, **leave**.\n\nThe DM may or may not be trying to hint at something here, but never underestimate the power of a party who might lose a free ride.\n\nKriv comes up with an idea.  He describes, in detail, how if we just commit some minor deforestation, we can use the logs (tree trunks) as rollers and pull the ship up the dam without damaging it.\n\nI still have no idea how we talked Char into it.\n\nYou can hear the DM's heart drop slightly as my plan unfolds. \"...  *Sigh*, just make the rolls.\"\n\nWouldn't you know it, we all roll very well, especially since Harg finally becomes sentient and can do some heavy lifting.  In a couple hours time, we have the ship up and over the dam, and we're sailing smoothly.\n\nFor all of five minutes.\n\nDM:  As you continue onward, you notice it gradually become... hotter.  Steam is visibly emanating from the riverbed, and it soon becomes intolerable.  You know that if you continue going down by river, you'll soon succumb to the mysterious mist.\n\nSo apparently DM's do things  for reasons, [go figure](http://giphy.com/gifs/idk-shrug-power-rangers-y65VoOlimZaus).\n\nWe're forced to jury rig the ship until it makes the house from Home Alone look like a pleasant stroll through the park, and continue on foot, now towing an angry pirate captain and his first mate, after convincing Inu that leaving him behind to watch the ship was a bad idea.\n\nAnd so our heroes continue on, unsure of what is in store for them.",

Perry is a troll with two cyber arms kitted out with implanted submachine guns and a laundry list of bioware all geared towards one thing: punching men really, really hard. Perry is so good at what he does that his punches do a downright ridiculous 20P per hit. The damage dished out by his hand cannons is so absurd that no living being has ever been punched by perry and lived to tell the tale. Perry is outfitted with a specialized piece of equipment, a backpack specifically designed to carry the second member of our team.\n\nHATRICK\nHatrick is the matrix specialist. As a character quirk he's radically prejudiced against technomancers which, though a touch irritating, could rather easily be tiptoed around were it not for one hang up. Hatrick is a technomancer. Everywhere he goes Hatrick carries a \"cow says moo\" board and insists to the point of aggression that it is his deck and what he uses to hack.\n Hatrick carries little in the way of weaponry aside from a double barrel shotgun. This shotgun is what gives Hatrick his stupid fucking name. Every single time Hatrick fires his gun, he holds a hat in front of it in order to \"Dazzle his enemies so they won't know what hit them.\" In order to reload Hatrick must dump his now completely destroyed hat and retrieve another from his ready to go sack of hats.\nHatrick despises walking and rides everywhere in the backpack carried by Perry so that when he decides to combat log and hack the enemies weaponry and enhancements during combat his limp dwarf body is shielded from the brunt of danger by Perry's monstrous frame. To fire his weapon more accurately Hatrick nestles his shotgun on Perry's shoulder or uses his horns as a makeshift tripod.\n\nSOLANA XYYZORWYN (MOMMA)\n\nOur final member is an intentionally pretentiously named elf mage who plays the role of mopping up the mayhem caused by Perry and Hatrick while simultaneously trying to keep them from dying. Momma is not one for subtlety and took exclusively splash damage combat spells. many a man has been char broiled by a fireball or melted by a stream of acid from momma, and Perry has frequently had his organs stuffed back into place by her medicinal knowledge and support spells. \nMomma is a fairly standard character save for one problematic quirk. During completely separate character creation processes Momma was created with an outspoken prejudice to dwarves making her relations with Hatrick a little...tense.\n\nTHE BULLSHIT COMMENCES\n\nOur story begins with our group taking a job from a Johnson and retrieving a commlink from a known drug dealer. Upon arrival they find him dead with not only his own commlink, but a mystery secondary unit.\nThe trio grab both and end up taking the bonus commlink back to their flat flat for analysis. During said analysis the door is blown off its hinges by a grenade and the apartment is flooded by gang members cybered to the point that they no longer look human and begin slashing at Perry and anyone nearby with implanted blades.\n\nA few hats, punches, and fireballs later two of the attackers are burnt to a crisp in the hallway, two have had their skulls forcibly relocated by basketball sized fists, and one has had his organs turned to hamburger meat. The party opted to take the last remaining member alive and interrogate him for information on who sent him and why.\n\nUp to this point every interrogation conducted by the god squad has been a disaster. An old lady has been fed to an alien, a spy had his head popped like a grape between an enormous mafia members hands, and a biker was slammed through the floor of a bar and turned into raspberry jam by Perry's capable hands. \n\nMomma steps forward and begins prepping a suggestion spell. She orders the ganger to \"Tell me everything you know!\" The prisoner fails his save and begins to tell her everything he knows.\n\n\"ONE PLUS ONE IS TWO. TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR. I LIKE APPLES BUT AM NOT A FAN OF OLIVES. MY RIGHT CALF IS ITCHY AND I AM IRRITATED BY THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS.\"\n\nMomma sighs, cancels the spell, and steps back offering someone else a swing at interrogation tactics.\n\nHatrick checks over the man's enhancements and noted that he could forcibly gain access to his cyber eyes, so he does so, gets some necessary memories from the implanted memory banks in the mans skull and decides to play an endlessly looping video of the attackers mother dying a horrible death over and over again until he tells them what they want to know. This plan backfires when the man quickly cracks under the torture and begins to scream hysterically.\n\nPerry eloquently states that \"MAN YELLING MAKE PERRY'S HEAD HURT\" and takes steps to calm the man down. He decides to relieve the man of seeing his mother brutally destroyed by removing his eyes from his head so \"Man no see mom any more.\" \n\nUnsurprisingly, he doesn't survive Dr. Perry's operation and bleeds out fairly quickly.\n\nThe GodSquad now high and dry on leads proceed to answer the commlink which began ringing during the commotion and embark on a journey involving many smashed heads and plentiful stacks of cash. \n\nUnfortunately, it would be in poor taste to give away too much too quickly so keep an eye out for the next update on the fantastic bullshittery of the GodSquad.",

        "text": "Hello again! This is a continuation of the previous story 'The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-Villain story Part 4', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4jjtqv/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/. Last time, the coterie of ne'er-do-wells started their operation with some much needed reconnaissance of New York. In doing so, they came to the conclusion that they would need more: More weapons, more supplies and more fighters. With this in mind, they led a crack-shot team of mercenaries to Fort Hamilton in an attempt to salvage anything of use. It was here that they encountered a young man by the name of Lawrence Terry, currently in possession of a highly advanced suit of armour. After a few rounds of 'Who-the-fuck-are-you', Lawrence hesitantly joined the team out of fear and having nothing better to do. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\nIt was an eerie silence that had befallen the Big Apple. Almost smothering, the lack of noise in such a bustling city was unnatural enough that even Barghast needed to restrain a shudder. It was only broken up by the sounds of equipment being loaded into a large truck, the M35 easily able to take the weight of the scavenged gear. The freelancers were the picture of efficiency, speaking only when absolutely necessary and making no more noise than a field mouse. The effect was somewhat ruined by the hydraulic hissing of Lawrence's suit as he hauled heavy crates across the charred military base. Though the soldiers of fortune needed two to a crate, the powered exoskeleton lifted them as if they were incredibly fluffy pillows. They had been plundering the base for half an hour now, stripping away absolutely everything of use. Crates of weaponry, rations, vehicle parts and ammunition now filled the multi-fuel vehicle.\n\n\"Not bad, boys and girls. We've picked up quite the haul.\" Event Horizon whistled appreciatively at the collection of odds and ends they had gathered. While the speedster had no use for mundane weaponry, he could at least acknowledge that the troopers would need this stuff. \"And Mr Stompy over here as well. Steel Soldier...SS? You really didn't think that one through, did you?\" His tone was filled with scorn at the young man who maneuvered awkwardly towards the truck with a final crate in hand. \"Well, at least you can lift.\" Event Horizon narrowed his eyes, his tongue sticking out from the corner of his mouth. Minato sighed, having come to recognise this as the caffiene addict's thinking face. \n\n\"What is it? What twisted thought is going on in that oddball head?\" The con-man asked warily. There was something of a camaraderie betweent the duo now, certainly enough of one for Kitsune to recognise potential danger when it hummed contemplatively in front of him. Event Horizon stroked his chin thoughtfully before leaning closer to his partner in crime.\n\n\"Why don't we just peel him out of that bad boy and put someone else in it? Someone who isn't, I don't know, an idiot?\" The speedster gestured in the general vicinity of the mercenaries as they finished checking over the vehicle itself. \"Imagine what one of our little bad-asses could do in that thing?\" His statement was proceeded by a maniacal cackle that Minato was quite impressed with. The sharply dressed criminal thought about it for a moment before shaking his head with a despondent grimace.\n\n\"I'm not sure it would work out.\" Watching the lumbering exoskeleton with a combination of distaste and regret, Minato sighed quietly. \"Who knows if we could even pry him out of the damn thing? No, for now we just have to treat him like a weapon.\" At the quizzical expression on Event Horizon's face, Kitsune smiled unpleasantly. \"Aim and fire.\" The duo chuckled quietly before their ear pieces sprang to life in a crackle of static. The confidence they felt was drained away in a single, sharp sentence from Sarge.\n\n\"Salvage team, Zel'tan talon inbound.\" The criminals were frozen in place, unsure of what to do, when one of their henchmen responded.\n\n\"Acknowledged sir, evacuating now.\" Like a well-oiled machine, the mercenaries sprung to life. One of them brought the heavy-duty truck rumbling to life while his companions hauled themselves into the cargo compartment. Lawrence looked between the groups, his confusion evident even beneath a tonne of metal plating and circuitry. \n\n\"What's going on? I haven't put the last crate in.\" His voice, already nasally, sounded like nothing so much as an electronic reproduction of Mickey Mouse's jaunty tone. The sheer absurdity of such a voice emerging from within the metallic behemoth was enough to break the villains free from their fugue states. Minato began to bark orders even as Event Horizon and Barghast started to move.\n\n\"We hear you, Sarge. We're moving now. Salvage team, I want everything back to base without a damn scratch on it. Do not engage Zel'tan unless it is absolutely necessary.\" There was a chorus of affirmatives across the channel, even as one of the soldiers helped to haul Kitsune into the truck. \"Event Horizon, get the gate open and then follow after us. Don't make a target of yourself.\" The speedster was already hauling the large, reinforced gate aside with a muscle-bulging display of superhuman strength. \"Barghast, stick to the shadows best you can. Let Event Horizon handle any initial threats and only engage if things get bad.\" There was a guttural growl of assent from the shadows, the sound enough to make Minato shiver even now.\n\n\"What about me?\" A new voice rang out over the frequency. Minato looked at the freelancers with him in confusion, receiving blank looks in return. \"What do you think I should do?\" If he was perfectly honest, Kitsune was almost embarrassed at how long it had taken him to identify this particular combination of timid acquiescence and barely concealed terror. His implaccable countenance firmly in place, the con-man spoke.\n\n\"Lawrence, I don't know how you got this frequency but we have Zel'tan talons incoming. We're leaving right now, so you had better shift your ass.\" The barked commands had absolutely no effect on the now rambling young man. \n\n\"The suit said something about an encrypted frequency being detected and then it asked if I wanted to decrypt it and I said yes then we could talk...\" His babbling was cut off by a snarled voice over the channel, causing him to flinch inside the powered frame. \n\n\"I believe you were instructed to move, meat!\" Barghast's echoing rumble silenced the stream of innane chatter spewing forth as effectively as a death threat. The only sound heard from Lawrence was the hydraulic hissing and heavy clanking of his armour stomping across the courtyard. Minato smirked darkly to himself as the freight truck began to pull away from the fort, finally able to appreciate Barghast's particular brand of terrifying. Event Horizon laughed openly, spinning his unbreakable staff with a showman's flair and easily keeping pace with the transport. Unseen by his compatriots, Barghast stalked after them as silently as the shadows he inhabited. Despite the bravado displayed by New York's would-be liberators, there was a noticeable tension permeating the air. They all knew that violence was imminent.\n\nSo imminent in fact that the group were completely flabbergasted when a Zel'tan Talon tore through one of the adjacent buildings with a metallic screech, showering the truck in heavy debris. Event Horizon came to an abrupt stop, rubble bouncing off of his form. Slack-jawed as he was, the speedster recognised only too late that he wasn't the only thing stopping suddenly. There was the squealing of a vehicle desperately braking and then Event Horizon was hurtling through the air, vaugely aware that something had slammed into him. The mercenary behind the wheel winced at the impact before returning his gaze to the hovering vessel above them. Segments of the Talon slid open, disgorging half a dozen hulking reptillian warriors into the damaged street. Bursting into action, the driver threw the door open and rolled out with a shout.\n\n\"Contact! Six troopers, one dropship!\" The trooper hit the ground running, narrowly avoiding a blistering streak of flame. His fellows leapt free from the back of the now stationary vehicle, readying weaponry as they landed. Minato stumbled forth from the truck's confines, coughing at the smoke now billowing up from the charred street. Barghast burst forth from the shadows, a primal roar bursting from his monstrous maw. The Zel'tan snarled a challenge at the pouncing abomination, gouts of super-heated flame hurtling towards him. Time seemed to slow, transforming the deadly confrontation into an incredibly surreal diorama for Event Horizon's viewing pleasure. Smiling grimly to himself, the lightning-quick thief chuckled and exploded into motion. A pair of the Zel'tan soldiers were propelled through the air, their colossal frames crushing an abandoned car beneath them. One of the mercenaries collided into Minato, the surprised duo narrowly avoiding incineration.\n\nThough these events transpired over the course of perhaps six seconds, Barghast was able to appreciate his companion's talent for chaos. His appreciation came to a close as his shadow-wrapped form fell upon the invaders, talons slicing gleefully through thick scale without effort. The remaining Zel'tan seemed torn between targets, a conundrum further complicated by the mercenaries opening fire. Though their weapons proved of little worth in harming the saurian soldiers, it distracted them for long enough that they failed to notice the shadow beneath them growing steadily larger until it was far too late. There was an earth-shaking boom accompanied by a thick concrete mist permeating the air. The conflict came to a stop as everyone turned to stare at the tremendous figure emerging from the newest crater in New York city. \n\n\"Uh...Sorry? Was...was anyone else going for them?\" Lawrence's electronically altered voice boomed from the armour like a loud speaker, completely destroying any semblance of severity in the situation. Event Horizon sighed despondendtly as he idly caved in the skull of a lizard-man. \n\n\"God damn it. You ruin everything.\" The speedster growled angrily before whirring into a blur of violence, atomizing the sole survivor with a flurry of powerful blows. \"Being a super-villain, you ruined it! Super science armour, you ruin it! Fighting aliens?\" Event Horizon spun, seizing now orphaned lower half and hurling it at the almost forgotten Talon. The remains collided against the hull with a wet splatter, forcing a blanch of disgust from Kitsune. The 80-Mile-an-hour man turned back to Lawrence with a disappointed glare, gesturing violently with his staff. \"You ruin it! Stop ruining my shit, you moody little turd!\" As the armour pilot spluttered out an objection, the hovering alien fighter craft decided to remind everyone of it's presence with a concentrated beam of thermal energy. It burned through asphalt and steel alike, carving a path of destruction across the street.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" Kitsune dove for cover in fright, sweat breaking out across his face from the sheer heat around him. Barghast vanished inside of one of the nearby buildings while the mercenaries scattered. Streaks of bright blue light lanced forth from Lawrence's gauntlets as the inexperienced pilot started pushing every prompt he could. \n\n\"Don't worry guys, I've got this!\" It was a strange combination of bravado and confusion that presented itself in Lawrence's synthesised voice. His energy bolts slammed into the hovering Talon, cracking the carapace. \"See! I'll handle it, you guys just sit back and relax.\" Confidence seeped back into the suit pilot and he stood slightly taller, ready to bring the pain. The Zel'tan responded with a focused blast of heat, blotting out Lawrence's form for a moment and turning the concrete beneath him into a violently bubbling puddle of ichor. Once the assault abated, the assorted survivors peered out from their hiding places. Each of them was shocked to see that the armour had held up against the heat weapon, though it was certainly worse for wear; the surface still glowing from the incredible temperature and warped in places. \"No worries...it's all good.\" The boldness in Lawrence's voice was replaced with a wavering fascimile of surity.\n\nEvent Horizon scoffed at the still smoldering pilot before taking off at a run. City blocks flew past in a blur of movement, the speedster reaching full speed for but a moment before sliding to a stop just outside of a Starbuck's. The once proud coffee-chain had been gutted, now a shell of it's formerly glorious self. The java-afficianado sighed sadly, shaking his head in tribute to the once-great house of cappuccino, before settling down into a runner's stance. His eyes closed, the super-villain took a deep breath and smiled. He could hear that battle still raging, tuning out the calls for help over his communicator. The hyper-dense criminal had taken note of everything on his way here; the path was already set clearly in his mind, the distance measured carefully. Event Horizon opened his eyes and ran. \n\nOne of the mercenaries was radioing for assistance while the others routed around in the truck for something that would assist them. Kitsune and Barghast watched on from their respective hideaways as the Zel'tan Talon continued to blast away at the stationary form of Lawrence. The super-villain's were planning out the quickest way away from the conflict, hoping to use the raging inferno as cover, when the flames were forcibly extinguished. As if by a great gust of wind, the fire fanned out of existence in the wake of an impossibly fast streak. The shape, barely observable in the chaos, crossed the open ground in a heart-beat and scorched up the side of a building. Glass shattered as it performed several circuits of the block, gaining in speed with each loop. The Talon attempted to follow the form but the pilot simply could not react fast enough to lock it down. An impact warning sounded inside the alien cockpit half a second before a rod of metal pierced the viewing screen and impaled the co-pilot. \n\nThe high-speed game of cat and mouse came to an end when Event Horizon exploded through the now damaged shield at full speed, snatching up his staff and continuing on. A moment later found him hurtling out from the back-end of the tail-spinning ship. Event Horizon slammed into the ground, tearing a furrow through what precious little concrete remained with his dramatically increased density. The speedster rolled to a stop and came up on one knee to watch the fireworks. He laughed uproariously as the alien craft tried to right itself before plunging towards the ground. Lawrence was crushed by the falling vessel, his form obscured by the colossal fireball that thundered into existence. The shockwave was enough to knock everyone else off of their feet, leaving the Caffe fiend clapping his hands in excitement. In the moments following the explosion, there was nothing but silence and ecstatic applause. The maniac's colleagues emerged from their vantage points, staring in shock at the gleeful man.\n\n\"Uh...guys? I think I'm trapped under here...\" Lawrence's tinny voice echoed out from their communicators. Event Horizon threw his hands in the air with a revolted cry.\n\n\"How did you manage to even fucking ruin this!?\"",

        "text": "**The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4l0x0d/dnd_5e_our_short_stay_in_two_rivers/) (Chapter 18/33)\n\n*Lutejk La’Dhroo ab Jujnis, 2997*\n\n\nOnce more I’m reminded that I’m nothing but a scared little girl. All the magic that I know couldn’t save me or anyone. I’m tired of being pathetic and yet... that’s probably all I’ll ever be. If there’s more to me than I know, I wish it would manifest now!\n\nWe started out on the trek toward the monastery mid morning. We entered into some woods that Zaren mentioned to having been sickly and suffering. The trees have diminished, which I had attributed to the locals over logging. And I should note that Zaren is Aragoth. The Dragonborn had an ego trip this morning and used his Primordial powers to change his looks into a man with reddish blonde hair that stuck out in a wild manner. Dunno why he felt the need to change his name, but alas he’s insistent on being called Zaren.\n\nWell, about an hour or two into the woods, large bug like creatures creeped up from the ground. Everyone reacted quickly enough that they didn’t present a threat to any of us. Just an omen of what was to come.\n\nWe then met this wolf girl. She was quite the site to see, her being barely dressed in wolf fur. She spoke solely to Zaren in a language I’m unfamiliar with. The man translated her plight, that she’s trying to protect her woods, but the creatures we fought (which weren’t magical) were the likely culprits to the forest’s destruction and scaring off the Golden Unicorn that dwells here.\n\nI was more concerned about getting to the monastery, but Zaren was insistent about helping since his brother was part of the wolf girl’s pack. The wolves are sickly according to her. Everyone thought it’d be of use to lend a hand, so I went along. Part of me wondered if it was just another wild goose chase, looking for a Unicorn. Then again, we did end up seeing Bahamut, so part of me was hopeful to actually see the mythical beast.\n\nThe wolf girl lead us to a meadow. She spoke of how she’s teleported back to the start of the path when she attempts to go to the lake. We tried helping her, but no matter if she was with us or carried, she would disappear and be back at the start of the trail. So we went on to see what was causing the magics.\n\nHeavens, Daevri brought up a topic I thought I’d never have to speak of, at least not to the four guys. He wanted to know if I was a virgin in case the Unicorn catered to the lore that only woman, untouched by men, could approach them. It’s bad enough that I’m alone among men and immodest in my dress, but to breach such a topic was most undignified and has only added to how sick I feel.\n\nThe lake soon came into view and with it six cat like creatures that Zaren said were displacer beasts. Each one had two, tentacle like tails and they didn’t hesitate for a moment to attack us. It was there that I felt the panic begin to set in, but with optimism and remembrance of Rora, I tried to channel courage. I wanted to be brave. So desperately I wanted to believe I could help protect all of us. Instead the false projection I tried to display was chipped away until all that remained was nothing but a useless shell.\n\nOf the spells that came to mind, I tried to use an illusion to generate an animal that the creatures might have taken more interest in. However it would appear that displacer beasts don’t care much for griffins. Then I tried to intimidate some of them with a slurring of words. I’ve seen how the spell would hinder creatures before but these ones... it didn’t phase them.\n\nBy then the beasts were upon us and I could hear the cries of pain, the shedding of blood, and my heart thundering in my ears. I raced in my head to know of something, ANYTHING, to protect my group. And in those moments I was suddenly attacked. Two tentacles clapped me on either side of my head and left me hazed for a moment. I remember a voice in my head screaming, “How DARE you!” I whirling around and from my right hand shot a bolt of fire. \n\nFrom the haze of battle and anger, Bordel rushed before me, swinging a greataxe at the creature. He then looked at me, probably wondering why I was standing in such a stupor, and pointed out Kimaris. The boy lay on the ground, blood all over him. I whispered, “Toir vuk!” a wave of energy leaving me. His eyes opened up right as Zaren fell next to him.\n\nI carefully maneuvered over to the two, Kimaris forcing a potion down the fallen man. He sputtered to consciousness, both still looking terrible. I then placed my hands on Kimaris’s head and sent another heal spell through him. As I spoke the last words of the prayer, I opened my eyes to find a displacer beast charging me.\n\n“Yiv æae bawn yoicd!” I wanted to shout, but my voice failed. I forgot how to breath as it leaped toward my body in one swift motion. It was my end. The claws and teeth most certainly would have torn me to pieces, but Daevri was there suddenly, driving his sword through the creature’s neck and guiding it to the ground. A loud thud and a final moan escaped the cat like creature.\n\nWhy I didn’t faint, I can’t say. I sucked in the air rapidly and returned my attention to Kimaris and Zaren. I placed my shaking hands on the man and sent one more of my energies through him to heal what I could quickly.\n\nWhat felt like ages was likely no more than a few hellish minutes. Yet they will forever be branded on my mind. Skeletons don’t seem so scary any more...\n\nAs we sat, recuperating, the Unicorn came and found us. It was probably the saddest thing I have ever beheld. The creature was a step away from becoming a full on Nightmare. She was black with a single gleaming spark of gold at the tip of her horn. She didn’t like us, we being folk not of the woods. The out lying towns have destroyed much of her forest to the point she gave up hope. And with her corruption, she began to corrupt what remained of home.\n\nThe wolf girl came to mind and I pitied her. The loyalty held toward the Unicorn was in vain. The only consideration given the girl was that of being spared her own corruption. I chastised the soon to be Nightmare for giving up, for not taking pride in what she had. Complaining about how it once was beautiful and homely seemed hypocritical when she had the power to keep her realm the way it once was.\n\nKimaris did point out that the size of woods played greatly into the Unicorn’s powers, but I feel the Unicorn gave up when she still had something to hold onto. Let alone we fought beasts due to her own corruption! She endangered us!\n\nI inquired about why she hadn’t utilized the wolf girl, Saoer as she called her, to speak to the people, to get them to respect the woods. The Unicorn then mentioned that both she and the girl had gone, well before things had gotten so bad, but no one would harken unto them. A new layer of anger came over me. What kind of people didn’t listen to a Unicorn? From the lore I read, they might as well be God’s themselves. You never cross a Unicorn!\n\nWith a heavy heart, I followed the party after we agreed to take her plight to the monastery. I know in the towns we pass through, I will be investigating the people, to gather why no one listened and respected the Unicorn and her forest. \n\nUntil then, we are resting in the meadow. Kimaris has been a sweetheart, having held my hand as we walked back. I’m trying hard not to let what’s bothering me  be conveyed to him or the others. They already have to put up with my ineffectiveness, no need to add to it by lamenting. \n\nHeh. Daevri tried to offer a hand earlier. He was curious about the Lyro Blade. I let him examine it, explaining it was a gift from Bahamut. He marveled at it and wondered why I wasn’t so confident with wielding the weapon. I simply replied, “Most blades are used for the purpose of harming or killing. It’s a talent I have yet to develop.”\n\nThe Human smirked and reminded me that the sword could be used to defend myself, I just need to find a purpose. And that’s the unfortunate thing. I have purpose. I have my life to protect, Kimaris, Bordel, Zaren, and Daevri too. I value life and that everyone should be able to live to the full extent of their days. I want the innocent to not be taken advantage of. So many things I could list that I would happily defend against, but to sink my blade into those who opposed me or those I love? I just can’t find it in me to inflict that pain.\n\nI think back to when Kimaris had me punch him. In a way, as much as I didn’t want to hurt him, it was easy to try because he was expecting it. He was okay with me hurting him then. I doubt those I attack will be as willing and of the mind to welcome my Lyro Blade into their gut. I wish there was a way I could just turn it all off. I wish I could step back inside of Rora and pretend to not care. Surely that would be easier than this...",

        "text": "This is a continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4kbz5s/35e_the_beginning_of_a_revolution_and_michella/)\n\nToday's story begins after the training of the soldiers recruited in the last story was finished. Although the party knew that Fort Cox was still well defended, it was nearby, so they set off to take the fort. The battle began with Michael, Michella and Justus Man sneaking around and trying to climb the back walls (not sure why we sent Justus Man). The elves and imbecile were spotted and the guards started to rush to fight them, Michael and Michella managed to kill a few. Around that same time we had a few soldiers throw alchemist's fire at the gates to burn them and distract the guards from the elves, but it was too late. Michella and Michael were fleeing into the forest, injured, and Justus man was being shot by multiple crossbow bolts, there was nothing we could do, he was dead. We took a couple minutes IRL to mourn the death of Justus Man, fallen comrade before continuing on.\n\nThe battle lasts the rest of the session, and in all we lost around 4-5 soldiers but took out the entire garrison of the Fort, largely thanks to Coraim's new lieutenant, the monk from the previous session, who absolutely annihilated any guards he came across. After the battle was over we hoisted the flag of the Revolution above the fort and called it a day. Coraim wanted to rename the fort Fort Coraim since he was the leader of the revolution but everyone decided against it.\n\nAlthough this was a shorter story than usual it was actually one of our longest sessions, it's just that most of that was back and forth fighting that I have no reason to describe.",

        "text": "Hello everyone! My name is Neal, and I'm the man behind the gaming blog [Improved Initiative](http://taking10.blogspot.com/). I've had a very warm welcome here, sharing my own, and other people's gaming stories, and I wanted to let everyone know that I'm always open to submissions for my [TableTalk](http://taking10.blogspot.com/p/table-talk-gaming-stories.html) feature.\n\nWhat am I looking for? Well, the short version is that I'm looking for those stories we all love to share with our gaming friends. Stories of adventure, stupid ideas, great triumphs and abysmal (yet funny) failures. Generally speaking somewhere between 400 and 1,000 words will do the trick, for those looking at word count.\n\nAlso, a brief word about what I'm not looking for. I'm currently trying to avoid any, \"you'll never believe the depths of random evil we sunk to,\" style stories. Stories about evil characters or campaigns are just dandy, but good or bad, a murderhobo is still a murderhobo.\n\nThanks for your time, everyone! If you're not sure if this is the sort of thing you'd be interested in, just flip through the Table Talk stories that are currently sitting in the archive, and see if it's the sort of thing you'd be interested in contributing to.",

        "text": "Let me preface this story with [this theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idoYCVLh2qI) to enhance the mood and a description of the player party.\n\n**~~The Party~~ The Gang**\n\n**Tyruss Wurm(The Psyker):** The warband's psyker. Due to an Administratum mishap, this temperamental, psychotic, and very paranoid battle-psyker was transfered under the command of an Arbites precinct within Inquisitor Nortrax's Sector. This spoke to the Inquisitor as a time to basically pick up a \"Discount Psyker\" to assist in his investigations. He bolsters a long las, and his psyfocus is a novelty snow-globe.\n\n**Ramallies Tarallis(The Sane One):** An aged and noble member of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, this rugged old man has been assigned to the party to keep the party's psyker on a leash and ensure he doesn't ~~summon a sex-demon from another dimension and doom the souls of an entire planet to eternal pain and misery~~ cause trouble while the party is investigating heresy.\n\n**Bop(The Party's Drunk Homeless Pet):** This character isn't actually a player but more so an NPC that all the players influence. Bop was a drunk homeless scummer they found in a gutter during a previous session. The players were expected to meet a contact in a nearby bar, and employed him to give them directions around the underhive. The party however, never let him leave and continues to supply him with food and booze and somehow managed to convince their master to allow him the rank of junior acolyte.\n\n**Thallaire Antonnies(The Tech Priest):** Thallaire is an ancient techpriest who was stranded on a spacehulk which drifted into his Inquisitor's sector. His story of resilience and experience with ancient technology made him look very valuable to Inquisitor Nortrax. However, his time alone has left him with a plethora of disorders. He lacks any form of social grace, and cannot function anywhere close to discretely. He will often screech his words across rooms as he doesn't understand the human concept of an \"indoor voice\" and obsessively hoards random objects that change from campaign to campaign, like books, small metal objects, or human arms.\n\n**Dax(The Psychopath):** A guardsman found alive in an overrun hive city, little is known about this man. He has occasional fits of pure violence and urges to kill and murder his enemies/bystanders in brutal ways when triggered by something that cues his past, or anger.\n\n**Chronaughtus Airon(The \"Cop\"):** A rugged member of the Adeptus Arbites, Airon has a small problem with alcoholism. He sometimes lacks social grace and stumbles over his words, but as a powerful living weapon of the law, this ex-enforcer doesn't always need to talk all that swiftly.\n\n**The Setting**\n\n*The players have just set up shop in an apartment on a desert world and are setting out to investigate the city streets. Before they go about their day however they decide to get breakfast.*\n****\n*Gorth, 0900*\n\nOur story begins with the heavily armed party strolling down the 90th floor of their apartment to the nearby turbolift. The lift opens with a ding. Inside stands an absolutely tiny noble clerk, a book-keeper for some noble staying in the building, he wears brown robes, is bald and wears giant bifocals, and has an augmented hand integrated with an auto-quill (and auto-whiteout naturally).\n\nThe party steps inside. They all tower over the tiny man. His eyes dart from face to face as he begins to sweat.\n\n\"Ahem\" he clears his throat, as soft elevator music begins to play.\n\nThe awkward air is perforated by the scent of damp techpriest and sacred unguents and the man begins to fix his robes.\n\n*Tyrus shifts on his feet, and holds his stomach as it lets out a growl. He turns to the scribe, and yells out,*\n\n**Psyker:** \"YOU THER----\"\n\n**ScribeL:** \"Aggahhh!\"\n\n*The little man interrupts with a yelp turning to face the party. The psyker starts again.*\n\n**Psyker:** \"YOU THERE! WHERE CAN WE GET BREAKFAST?\"\n\n**Scribe:** \"W-w-what?\"\n\n**Psyker:** \"BREAKFAST!\"\n\n**Scribe:** \"What??\"\n\n**Psyker:** \"WHERE CAN WE GET BREAKFAST?\"\n\n*The psyker grabs the man's arm.*\n\n**Psyker:** \"BREAKFAST, LITTLE MAN, BREAKFAST!\"\n\n**Scribe:** \"I don't know! I don't know!\"\n\n**Psyker:** \"BREAKFAST!\"\n\n*They psyker is shaking him now.*\n\n**Psyker:** \"BREAKFAST!\"\n\n**Scribe:** \"I don't know! Please! I d-d-d-don't!\"\n\n**Psyker:** \"BREAKFAST!\"\n\n**Scribe:** \"Ahhh! Someone help me!\"\n\n**Psyker:** \"BREAKFAST!\"\n\n*The psyker shakes him harder, the scribe finally yells out,*\n\n**Scribe:** \"Okay okay! There's a small eatery my master attends in Downton Square! It's around the corner! Please, just stop! Stop!\"\n\n**Psyker:** \"Fantastic. Thank you.\"\n\nThe lift returns to silence, save for the elevator music, as the small man begins to vibrate with a sudden anxiety.\n\n*DING*\n\nThe scribe rushes out, leaving the stewards in the lobby to glance toward the lift. The party strolls out and heads into the streets to find their restaurant. It doesn't take long for them to find it. The place is spacious and tailored to nobles. The party leaves the busy street of vendors and workmen, ducking out of the desert heat and beating sun and stepping into the lobby of the restaurant.\n\nInside, the air smells of roast and wine and cigar smoke, the maroon carpet is spotless and wood columns stretch into the high ceiling. A servant approaches the party, and talks to the noble player, Ramallies.\n\n**Server:** \"Table for one?\"\n\nRamallies glances toward the other players,\n\n**Ramallies:** \"Um, yes?\"\n\n**Server:** \"Oh, please forgive me, the passage to the canteen your body guards may eat at is just beyond that column, I nearly forgot.\"\n\nThe rest of the player party grins as they are escorted down some stairs into a basement/bar. The bar floor is lined with straw and the long tables in the space are occupied by many noble body guards and mercenaries hired on by merchants, squires, and scholars who are visiting Gorth to escort them around the city.\n\n**THE STORY WILL NOW SPLIT INTO TWO PERSPECTIVES: THE NOBLE and THE GANG**\n****\n \n**THE NOBLE**\n\nRamallies is seated by his servant, who pours him a starting glass of water.\n\nThe server asks, \"What may I get you, m'lord?\"\n\nRamallies pleasantly replies, \"A wine to start, two glasses, the oldest and richest you have.\"\n\n\"At once m'lord.\" the server rushes off to fetch the noble his wine.\n\nRamallies settles back into his chair and sips his water, contemplating what he wants to dine on this morning, happy to be away from the riff-raff of the other acolytes for once.\n\n**THE GANG**\n\nThe party steps into the bar for noble body guards and mercenaries, as the common folk are not to dine with nobles, even if they keep said nobles from getting their skulls bashed in by scummers in the streets. The bar is crowded with many heavily armed men who eye the party.\n\nThe party seats themselves at the empty spaces at the bar, except for the techpriest, who continues to look about the room.\n\nThe bartender asks the rest of the seated party. \"What'll you have? Don't waste my time.\"\n\n**Dax:** \"Cheapest you have. Miller Stout if you've got it on tap.\"\n\n**Airon:** \"Vod, a double shot...no wait a triple, no wait, just give me a bottle.\"\n\n**Tyruss:** \"EGGS!\" (The 40k equivalent of pigeon eggs mind you.)\n\n**Bartender:** \"I like how you guys operate. But him, (pointing at the techpriest) he'll have to make do. We don't serve his kind here.\"\n\nThe techpriest pays no mind to anyone in the room however, and waddles across the room to a table occupied by three massive body guards, with shotguns slung over their chairs. He sits at their one empty chair, and they all eye him angrily.  \n\nWith a burst of static, Thallaire lets out,\n\n\"GREETINGS, HUMANS.\"\n\n**THE NOBLE**\n\nThe servant returns with Ramallies wine, and he begins to sip.\n\n\"And for your meal?\" the server asks.\n\nRamallies thinks for a moment...\n\n\"What steak have you?\"\n\nThe server replies, \"A fine local grox bea-\"\n\n\"No, no local steak will do. What import?\"\n\nThe server nods, \"We have a snow-ox hind quarters imported from the Aegis sector, m'lord.\"\n\n\"Ah yes that will do.\"\n\nThe servant rushes away as Ramallies starts his first glass of wine.\n\nBeautiful music begins to play in the chamber as Ramallies waits for his meal.\n\n**THE GANG**\n\n**Mercenary:** \"What in the warp do you think you're doing?\"\n\n**Thallaire:** \"Sitting, my friends.\" (His vocal emitter tuned too loud)\n\n*The mercenaries at the table flinch at the loudness.*\n\n**Mercenary:** \"Get the frak out of here! We're not your friends! Pal!\"\n\nThallaire cocks his head, contemplating the appropriate social retort.\n\n*After a long pause. Very long. Awkwardly long. The tech priest replies.*\n\n**Thallaire:** \"That is not what your mother said when I was in her quarters last night.\"\n\n*The table begins to chuckle, all but the one mercenary/bodyguard talking to Thallaire.*\n\n**Mercenary:** \"Shut up! All of you!\"\n\n*The man stands and stabs a large combat knife into the table, leaving it sticking straight up as he points into Thallaire's face.*\n\n**Mercenary:** \"Get out of here! Now, this is your last chance!\"\n\nThe room gets quiet. Everyone watches as once again Thallaire cocks his head. After a moment Thallaire raises his palm to the knife stuck on the other side of the table.\n\nUsing the trait *Magnetic/Ferric Lure* the techpriest uses his magnetic powers to pull the knife out of the table and very quickly shoot it toward his hand, hoping to catch it by the handle...however...it does not go as planned and the blade instead goes clean through his hand and the knife sticks out of his palm.\n\nThe table looks on in awe. Everyone is shocked and unsure of what the *fuck* just happened. \n\n**THE NOBLE**\n\nThe servant comes back and places a beautiful steak in front of Ramallies, \"Here you are, m'lord.\"\n\n\"Ah, thank you.\" He replies, \"May I have some spice?\"\n\n\"At once m'lord.\" The servant begins to use his grinder and peppers the steak.\n\nBut as he moves away, the servant's elbow bumps one of the two glasses of wine, sending it spiraling onto Ramallies lap.\n\nRamallies stays calm however, and tells the servant, \"It is okay.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry, m'lord.\"\n\nThe wine starts to soak into Ramallie's lap as he waits for the servant to bring a towel.\n\n**THE GANG**\n\nThe table around the techpriest has now sat down, intimidated by the techpriest's ability to use the force or some shit to propel a knife into his palm from across the table.\n\nThey realize they don't want to mess with someone so crazy. It isn't worth their time. \n\nA few moments later, though, another mercenary, much larger than the rest, lumbers into the bar and approaches Thallaire. \n\n**New Mercenary:** \"That was a good piss!\" He exclaims to his friends at the table before stopping, noticing the techpriest in his seat. \n\n**New Mercenary:** \"What is this guys? Some joke?\"\n\nThe table says nothing.\n\n**New Mercenary:** \"Okay seriously. Get the frak up.\"\n\nThallaire doesn't move. \n\n**New Mercenary:** \"Come on guys, help me out here.\"\n\nThe table doesn't move. They look down at their plates. \n\n**New Mercenary:** \"(Smirking) So be it. We'll do it the hard way.\"\n\nThe new mercenary rears back and punches the techpriest in the face, dealing some damage to the techpriest but doing damage to himself as the techpriest is made of metal. He steps back and holds his fist. \n\n**New Mercenary:** \"Why you...\"\n\nThe new mercenary begins to reach for his knife, but before he does something sharp prods the back of his neck...\n\nDax has stood up and stuck his powersaber to the back the of large mercenary's neck, keeping his thumb on the activation rune, ready to liquifiy the flesh of the man's neck in an instant. \n\n**Dax:** \"Put your hands up or I'll frakking cut you.\"\n\nAt this point the bartender starts yelling for them to \"take it outside\", but Dax ignores him. \n\nAt this point everyone is yelling, there are weapons drawn, the Psyker is yelling, asking \"ARE MY EGGS DONE?\"\n\n**New Mercenary:** \"Take it easy man, just take it easy!\"\n\n**Dax:** \"Put your frakking hands up!\"\n\n**Psyker:** \"EGGS! WHERE ARE MY EGGS?\"\n\n**New Mercenary:** \"Okay okay!\"\n\n**Dax:** \"Stand in the corner! Go!\"\n\n**Psyker:** \"MY EGGS!\"\n\n**New Mercenary:** \"Please don't kill me!\"\n\n**Dax:** \"Stand in the corner! NOW!\"\n\n**New Mercenary:** \"Come on man!\" \n\n**Dax:** \"This is our techpriest's seat now, go eat your food alone in the corner!\"\n\nDax pushes his plate off the table and ushers the mercenary to the corner of the bar.\n\n**Psyker:** \"WHERE ARE MY EGGS! WARP DAMN IT!\"\n\n**THE NOBLE**\n\nRamallies finally finishes drying his lap and finishes his meal.\n\nPleased with his breakfast, Ramallies sits back and sighs when the rest of his party comes into the lobby...escorted by security. \n\n*I'll be fixing grammar mistakes on the fly. I'm sorry I'm lazy and it is late. I may also fill the story out with more details as my players remind me what happened as it's been a while since the session. Thanks.*\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Some structure bits in the first part\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "text": "The party started up the stairs, and the closer we got to the top the more we heard the kicking down of doors, the shatter of glass, and the loud echo of footsteps.\n \nOnce we finally found Christoph, he had just made his way to the room I had described, having unsettled every door and room along the hallway up until that point in search of it.\n \nWe all followed in behind him, myself, Xavier, Shizune, Veldross, and the druid and the bearded fellow whose names I had yet to learn.\n \nChristoph stood there, transfixed on the elaborate wood carved pillars bearing the head of the dragon, and after a few brief moments, something dark and primal snapped in him. He took his sword and began hacking away at them, and jagged shards of brown oak began flying, chipping off of his blade.\n \nThe rest of the party ran toward him, with the exception of myself and Shizune. While she seemed amused by the violent outburst, I used the distraction as an opportunity to further examine the room, once again finding myself drawn to the tapestries, those intricate works of art, whose depictions of grand scale destruction could almost be seen as beautiful if they weren’t so horrific. Upon this inspection though I noticed large, expensive looking jewels sewn into the fabric. As my new companions fought amongst themselves, I pulled out my dagger, and, in the blink of an eye, removed all the jewels and snuck them into my belt pouch, which, I was happy to find upon inspection, still had the 500 gold pieces Bronson had bestowed upon me before I left for Parnast.\n \nPoor Bronson would be saddened to hear the news of his Helmed Horror, but oh well, down payments are non-refundable.\n \n“Look out!” I heard a voice scream. I quickly turned to see that the party had lost control of Christoph and he pulled a burning log from the fireplace and began to set the room ablaze with it. He was currently heading in my direction, no doubt with an eye on the tapestries. I simply stood aside and let him at them. I had what I needed.\n \n“Wait!” exclaimed Veldross “Those tapestries. Look at them! They look like maps. They could be a clue as to Tallis’ plans. Xavier, quickly, copy them before this fool burns them to cinders.”\n \nXavier pulled a journal out of his satchel and began frantically scribbling with a piece of sharpened coal.\n \n“Kolt.” Shizune said, with a slight hint of whimsy to her voice, as she leaned in closer to the druid. “ Put that fire out, would you?”\n \nWith a flick of his hands and a muttering of a few words, Kolt, the druid, cast a water spell that dispensed the fluid out of thin air and sent it splashing into the burning tapestries and pillars. As the room began to fill slightly with steam, mixed with the smoke from the fire, Kolt spoke “Hey, look. There is a door hidden behind one of these tapestries.”\n \n“It would appear that Christoph’s madness had shown us something we wouldn’t have otherwise seen.” Xavier proclaimed as he continued scribbling and copying the images, though with less haste now that his muse was no longer aflame.\n \n“Well at least SOMETHING can be salvaged from this debacle.” sighed Veldross, with a flagrant hint of annoyance. “Christoph, we all understand your hatred of these villainous winged creatures, but for the sake of the gods, you mad fool, reign in this insanity. These are just carvings and tapestries. You could have burned us all alive.”\n \nChristoph simply shrugged off Veldross’ chidings and began moving toward the door, makeshift torch still in hand. Veldross stepped in front of him and placed both hands upward in a motion to halt. “No, I’ll get the door. Please, just put the damn torch down.”\n \n \nVeldross moved toward the door, kneeled and pressed his ear up against the solid wood frame. “I don’t hear anything.” He said as he stood, released the latch, and opened the door.\n \nHe stepped inside as the rest of us looked on. The hidden room was smaller than the one we were currently standing in, but still sizable, with a large decorative and comfortable looking chair sitting empty in the center. The walls were adorned with many hunting trophies. The heads of bears, bucks, and the like, all looked down with dead empty eyes from their perches. The half elf rummaged around for a moment and then found another hidden door along the wall, unlatched it, and looked inside.\n \n“It appears to be a ladder leading to the roof. I’m going to inspect further, see if I can track anything.” the ranger said as his began to climb.\n \nKolt, Xavier, the bearded fellow whose name still escaped me, and Christoph moved into the small trophy room and I began to follow until Shizune reached over, put an arm in front of me to block my movement, looked down at me and said “The sparrow flies with it’s own.”\n \nThieves Cant. She was speaking Thieves Cant. An odd assortment of dialects, phrases, and garbled mish mashed languages  melded together in such a complex way that only the select few who call the shadows home, thieves, charlatans, murderers and rogues, know how to speak it.\n \n*translated from Thieves Cant*\n \n*It’s nice to run into a fellow rogue. I’ve traveled with these uptight prudes for far too long* the girl said as she smiled at me, those hollow black eyes almost sparkling with amusement.\n \n*You’re a thief* I said, somewhat surprised *From the look of that armor and the way you carry yourself, I would have thought you for a paladin.”\n \nThe girl gazed off slightly. She seemed somewhat embarrassed. Then she looked back and smiled *Honestly, my life and all it’s layers are still somewhat foggy. A mystery to unravel as I recover I suppose. I know I was an assassin at some point. I know I am trained in the deadly arts of fighting. But so much more of my life is hidden behind the veil of my mind since...since…*\n \n*Since you died and came back to life.* I interrupted.\n \nShe seemed taken aback by the information I had, then a flicker of understanding came across her face as she sneered sinisterly. *Xavier talks too much for his own good, but yes, I fell in battle just days ago.*\n \n*And you were resurrected? How, if you don’t mind me asking?* I pressed.\n \nWith that, her entire demeanor changed. The smile was gone, replaced by a stern look. *My God, Lathander, the Morninglord, bringer of Dawn and New life, saw fit to return me to this plane of existence.*\n \nI moved closer to the child, closer, I could tell, than she felt comfortable with. *In exchange for what? I must know.*\n \nThe sinister sneer returned as she gazed at me...no...not at me..into me... with those piercing eyes *It’s a heavy price, gnome. Heavier than most are willing to pay.*\n \n*Tell me.*\n \n*An undying dedication to the service of my lord and all his works.* she giggled, her sneer turning to a smile.\n \nThe affectation of her voice, the way her eyes seemed to glance away ever so subtly….she was lying to me. About the means of her resurrection, her God, everything. It was plain to see that the girl was skilled in the art of deception, but she had spent too much time with these amateurs and was out of practice against those with the same set of skills. I wasn’t swayed, and she knew it.\n \nFeeling secure in my advantage, yet not wanting to push the issue, I quickly bandied out another subject. *That’s interesting. You know, I feel pretty rude, we haven’t been properly introduced, my name is David.*\n \n*No, it isn’t.* she shot back *Tell the others whatever you like, but I want the truth. What’s your ‘real’ name?*\n \nMaybe she wasn’t as out of practice in deception as I initially thought. Just as I had caught her slipping, she saw right through me. *Rebel. David was the name given to me, Rebel is the name I earned.*\n \n*Pleasure to meet you, Rebel. You can call me Shizune.*\n \nThe girl’s presence, and the twisted emphasis she put on my name when she spoke it, became more and more unnerving the longer I was around her, but I refused to let my unease show.\n \n*Well, Shizune. As much as I appreciate being released from that dungeon, if you fell in battle mere days ago, what, if I may ask, brings you here?*\n \nA look of anger emblazoned the girl’s face and through gritted teeth she replied “We seek the one who fell me. We followed her through a portal she used to escape my party’s grasp and wound up here, just down the slope from this lodge by the stone pillars. Once we deal with Tallis we will pick up the trail. I don’t care if we must seek the very ends of the known world, Rezmir will greet death by my hand.*\n \n*Rezmir? I’ve heard that name. Cragdor, the dwarf who was held captive in the dungeon with me, was being tortured by Tallis’ minions. They believed he was one of Rezmir’s disciples.*\n \n“There was no sign of Tallis on the roof, just a pterodon nest and some remains of the beasts’ last few meals. I also….uhmm...did I miss something?” asked Veldross inquisitively as he exited the trophy room to find Shizune seething with anger.\n \n“Rezmir.” was the only intelligible thing she said as she ran screaming out of the room.\n \nMyself and the rest of the party ran after her, as she sprinted down the hall and bounded down the stairs.\n \nOnce we reached the first floor we found her standing in an open doorway. It led to the parlor where I remember finding the Helmed Horror all that time ago, but the scene that lay within was far more terrifying than any conjured demon in plate mail.\n \nThe dwarf cook, Tharm, lay closest to the door with his throat slit. There were defensive wounds on his hands and a bloody butcher knife by his side. One of his I imagine. In the middle of the room, sprawled across a lounge seat in a twisted and unnaturally contorted pose, was Marcella. Her wounds were grisly and multiple and the last grotesque visage etched on the poor child’s face was almost too much to bare.\n \n“The prisoners are dead too.” said Veldross as he entered the room. “Their throats slit.”\n \n“No thanks to you.” mocked Shizune. Veldross shot her an angry look, but let the insult hang unreciprocated.\n \n“There’s a blood trail leaving the room. It looks like Tharm got a clean hit in before he was fell.” Xavier reported as he knelt near the dwarf’s lifeless body.\n \n“That tricksy dwarf. What was his name? Cragdor?! He did this.” Veldross exclaimed as he exited the room and followed the blood trail down the hall and out of the front entrance to the lodge.\n \nAt the front door Veldross’ shoulders slumped and he exhaled in a sigh of defeat. “There’s no sense in tracking him. He could have passed through any number of these portals by now. He’s long since gone.”\n \n“Along with our only lead to Rezmir.” Shizune huffed.\n \n“Uhm...do the rest of you smell smoke” asked Kolt in a perplexed tone, as we all turned to see him staring up the stairs to the second floor.\n \n“Christoph?” Veldross exclaimed quizzically as he looked around for the fighter. Then it dawned on him and the rest of the party. “That mad son of a bitch never came downstairs!”\n \nNow it was Veldross doing the bounding up the stairs, and sprinting down the hall to the master bedroom. There in the center of the room was Christoph, unmoving, staring vacantly into the flames of the impromptu pyre he had made of the tapestries around one of the dragon pillars.\n \nKolt rushed into the room and was forced yet again to cast a water spell to stop Christoph from burning the house to ashes around us. Christoph snapped out of his trance and seemed perturbed to find his handiwork a smoldering soggy mess. He glanced over all of us, snorted in disgust and stomped out of the room.\n \n“Christoph! Christoph, dammit.” called Xavier as the tiefling trailed behind the brawler.\n \n“I’m not following that daft bastard.” stated Veldross as he left the room and decided to double back down the hall the way we came and check the rooms Christoph abandoned in his search for Tallis. Shizune and I followed as the robed figure, so easily forgotten with his stoic, silent manor, and Kolt, the druid, remained in the master bedroom sifting through the havok Christoph had caused.\n \nAt the far left corner of the manor’s second floor, past the remains of a splintered husk of a door Christoph had unhinged earlier, Shizune and I found Veldross in the room that appeared to be the armory...or what remained of it. Some heavy damage had been done to it recently. The Eastern facing wall was completely caved in, with remains of brick and mortar scattered across the room’s floor, and extensive burn marks were spread all across the walls and floor in no visible pattern. The elements had made their way through the missing wall and coated everything in the room with a light frosting of fresh snow.\n \n“Do any of these weapons look in tact or useful?” asked Shizune as she entered the room.\n \n“Only this one.” stated Veldross as he turned and faced us. In his hand was an imposing spear. To unknowing eyes it would appear to be a spear like any other, with a hilt, staff and blade, but to my eyes it was the weapon that struck down my beloved Ellyjoe. The war chief had brandished one just like it, same shimmering metal, same binding on the hilt, same intrinsic markings carved into shaft. It couldn’t possibly be the same blade, could it? Regardless, it’s presence made me uneasy.\n \n“Set it down, and don’t touch it again. You have no need of such a weapon.” I said, my tone unerring and flat.\n \nVeldross lowered the weapon but did not release it. He simply glared at me “What was it you said to me earlier? Oh, ‘I’m not doing anything on your orders’ I believe it was. Now, who the fuck are you, gnome, to try and command me?”\n \n“That is a weapon of evil, with a sinister purpose. It holds no value to you Harper.”\n \n“I state what’s valuable to me, not some common criminal!”\n \n“Rebel” Shizune leaned closer to me “What’s the problem? It’s a weapon like any other.”\n \n“No.” I replied. “It’s a cult weapon, it should be destroyed just like anyone who chooses to wield it. Just like..” a lump caught in my throat “..just like the soldier who used one just like it to murder my wife.”\n \n“I’m sorry for the loss of your loved one, gnome, but the weapon stays with me.” was Veldross’ only reply.\n \nI unsheathed my short sword and Veldross raised the spear and gripped it tightly in a defensive stance.\n \n“I don’t speak of my beloved to evoke your feigned sympathies half blood. I do it to hammer home a point. You WILL return that weapon to where you found it.”\n \nThe half elf and myself remained silent for a few moments afterwards, the tension hanging thick, surrounding us. Shizune’s eyes darted back and forth between us, yet she made no movements. She simply smiled, that amused, wicked smile. We were entertaining her.\n \nThen, Xavier appeared suddenly in the doorway. “Fellows, come quickly! Christoph has found something of great importance!”\n \nIf he noticed the current heightened state between Veldross and myself he didn’t acknowledge it, he simply turned and motioned for us to follow.\n \n“We will revist this discussion, half blood.” I said as I sheathed my short sword and exited the room.\n",

Our party is conformed by 2 padawans (Keldor and Miraluka) whose masters were murdered by the empire, 3 kids (a Noghri, a Zabrak and a Human) of which two of them are force sensitive, a mandalorian and a Bothan that lost his family at empire's hand. It's a level 3 party.\n\nStole a ship from a contrabandist, when we get to space we found a star destroyer and some tie fighters looking for us (we had killed a lot of imperials on the ground, so they were after us). We take the first coordinate on the ship's computer to make the jump as fast as posible and ended up in Nar Shaddaa.\n\nWe land, and check the ship status, it's ok but it needs some repairment. We go to a tabern and found out that there's a bounty on our heads so we decide to get the hell out of there asap (my character received a stun shot from the guy that informed us and a reclamation for some payment so we could use that to run away). We walk out the place and a bounty hunter intercept our way with his pals.  \n  \nBH: Stop there bounty! You're coming with us.  \nBothan (me): I'm not sure what you're talking about.  \nBH: Shut up, there's a bounty on your head and I'm gonna take it.  \nB: I've never heard about that, you must be confused.  \nBH: Aren't you the crew of the Coloso?  \nB: (Deception check, Nat 20) We are not, we owe money to the guy that shot me on the tabern, we don't own a ship.  \nBH: hmm ok.  \n\nSo we ended what could be a really nasty encounter with a single roll. Our GM ended like \"I can't believe the BH is so stupid that he believed this\".\n\nEnd of session xD!",

My shoulders were bare and there was no hiding the feathers. Goodness, as I brushed my hair, I took a peek at my shoulders only to catch Bordel staring. Immediately I looked away, my cheeks burning with embarrassment. What might he think of me?\n\n“Sleep well?” he asked as I began to braid my hair. All I could think about was hurrying off to breakfast. It was my intentions to have left before he woke. \n\n“I did, though I got in a bit later than I intended,” I replied. A moment later, I heard Bordel get up and come to the washbasin. I kept my focus on the mirror on the armoire, twisting the braid into a bun. As I pinned it in place, the Cleric then asked if I had seen his brush. I looked at him, confused like, before a laugh escaped me. Quickly I clamped my mouth shut, for part of me wondered if he was serious. Yet as sure as I was that he was teasing me, what with him having a bald head, I replied, “I haven’t.”\n\nSatisfied with the state of my hair, I then wrapped the scarf around my shoulders and made my way out of the room. While walking to the Galley, I couldn’t help but enjoy the lightness I felt. Just maybe I’m not a bothersome thorn. I know I’m feeling more worthy of the bracelet Bordel gave. \n\nAfter eating breakfast, we all got ready to disembark into the muddy port of Two Rivers. As we all stood on deck, Kimaris pointed out my feathers.\n\n“Do those hurt?” he asked. I laughed and said no, but rather they itched a lot. I asked if he’d be so kind to scratch the ones around my shoulder blades and he obliged me. Daevri then poked fun saying I was turning into an Angel. At that notion, Bordel echoed how I felt, by saying, “No she’s not.” Let alone, I don’t know how many Angels have their arms growing feathers.\n\nOnce off the ship, Daevri made it well known his repulsion to manual traveling. I rolled my eyes. His way of life wasn’t too far from my upbringing. Granted on a finer scale, but still. Walking isn’t that difficult, even if it’s a week’s worth. Kimaris said that’s how long it’d take us to get to the base of the mountains where the stepping stone trial awaits us.\nI’m actually really excited to visit this monastery. The view from the top must be a sight to see.\n\nWe split off in town; Kimaris heading to a tower to signal his coming, Bordel to the blacksmith, and I got stuck with babysitting duty as I marched Aragoth and Daevri to the local tavern. To avoid the Human from whining the entire trip, collectively we thought we would see if there were any caravans heading toward the monastery. We did find one, but even though it would be in town any day, we would have to wait a week (unless convinced otherwise) before it made it’s trek back. To not waste time we bribed Daevri with piggy back rides and not delay Kimaris's return. We will sent out first thing tomorrow morning.",

        "text": "I had a game that ran for like six years before finally running out of steam. Towards the end I think we were all getting a little tired of it, and we started trying more and more crazy shit. One of our players was a dwarf (Gred) who started as a hard-living, hard-drinking kind of guys and slowly over time we had turned this into a long running semi-serious storyline about Gred confronting his alcoholism. Yes, we were a weird party.\n\nOne session Gred announces he's giving up booze for good and the party all applaud him and head out on the adventure. The DM plays along by putting us into a story where we have to enter a lot of taverns and we all have a lot of fun with Gred struggling with his demons. After one of the party members dies in a big boss battle (we brought him back later) Gred goes into a spiral and starts hitting the sauce again and our buddy starts playing Gred as losing control, alienating his party and our allies, all that fun stuff.\n\nBy this point our DM starts getting annoyed with David (player of Gred) and starts penalizing him in-game with the reasoning that if he's as hammered as David's making him seem, he should be impaired in his ability to fight. David is annoyed at this, saying that it's a plot element like any other and getting into dumb arguments about Dwarf biology. Finally David comes up with a compromise, no penalties on Gred's numbers if David gets himself blotto enough while we're playing to impare his own ability to run his character effectively in combat. The DM shockingly agrees (later he told us he just wanted this issue to go away, and he figured David wouldn't have the stomach to drink enough to actually play Gred as drunk.)\n\nSo the next session comes around and David has a big bottle of Jack Daniels with him and he's going shot for shot with Gred. As we get deeper into this dungeon, I see the regret start to creep into David's face, but he's generally holding it together. We fight some kobold's and Gred makes his first big mistake: he wastes like two turns hitting a kobold the DM had already said was dead, the DM just lets him keep going at the guy, and none of us notice (normally he would have reminded us the kobold was dead and not let us keep hitting it, or just removed the piece from the board, but the DM is playing by drunk rules now) but we make it through the session anyway.\n\nCome the big boss battle, though, both David and Gred are having trouble keeping it together. For this battle we really need Gred to tank for us, but David is not quite following the fight. We try telling him where to go (and he's waving assent, like, yeah, whatever they say) but the DM will not let that fly, stating that David needs to tell him what he wants to do out of his own mouth. At this point we're giving up on David. Asked what he wants to do, David keeps saying \"I hit the dragon\", when he's nowhere near the dragon, which the DM rules is Gred just swinging his axe wildly with no one around him. The rest of us are debating if we can take this dragon without Gred's help (we had a rare artifact that could theoretically get us out of the fight, but we really didn't want to waste it, and we weren't 100% sure it would work) but we get a boost of encouragement when our wizard cleverly maneuvers us to get Gred between the dragon and our ranged characters for a while, and direct some of the dragon's attacks onto Gred (essentially getting him to tank for us without meaning to) and even getting him in range of Gred's \"attacks\" (David is face down on the table, just rolling a d20 at random.)\n\nWe think we're doing pretty well until a particularly devastating attack takes out our rogue and suddenly the battle seems to be against us. Out of nowhere, on his turn, David pops his head up, moves his token into range (the dragon had spaced himself just out of Gred's range, assuming movement was no longer an option for David), rolls a success on his attack and puts his head back down. We're yelling at David to roll damage and he's not responding, DM rules that without a damage roll the attack has no effect. David lifts his head like three inches, grabs the damage dice (wish I could remember what he was rolling) and hits the maximum damage the attack could do. DM is shocked, looks down at his sheets and counts a bit, then looks up at us and says \"the dragon is dead.\"\n\nWe lose our fucking minds while David lies passed out on the table. We got out of there without losing a party member, and David decided he was never doing that again and ended the alcoholism storyline. He also didn't drink at all at a wedding we were at three days later, because he said alcohol still sounded gross to him.",

        "text": "So me and my friends have multiple DM's and games going and we rotate around every few months so people that want to DM and learn can. I made a new character for an established game that started before I started playing where the characters are running a trading business with adventuring on the side. Boom Boom sees a flyer requesting new crew members while eating out of a garbage pile, and after using the flyer for other \"business\" he runs off to the docks. Boom Boom is a goblin alchemist; about 2'8\" with a dark blue/singed look to him, he's missing an ear after an unfortunate experiment and seems to always be smouldering and smells like somebody lit fire to a garbage dump/ body pile. He is very smart when it comes to things like explosives,fire, formula, or creating new ways to explode something but is basically a hyperactive idiot in all other aspects.\n\nSo, Boom Boom runs up the gangplank to the crew's ship and over to the man at the wheel who was luckily the captain. After a bit of questioning Boom Boom decides to show him what he does by leading him to the side of the ship and throwing a bomb into a nearby unattended(luckily) rowboat. After the wood chips stop flying the captain reluctantly allows Boom Boom to join the crew, to which Boom Boom gleefully screams and runs below deck and begins mating with the giant Boom Boom (cannon). After dealing with the authorities about the exploded row boat the captain orders the cabin boy to give Boom Boom a bath because of the god awful smell. This poor cabin boy eventually hog ties Boom Boom, after recieving multiple scratches and bite marks, and uses a length of chain to gag him. The cabin boy then lowers Boom Boom into the ocean with a rope where he thrashes and screams like cat being thrown in a bath.\n\nAfterwards, Boom Boom is raised up and the cabin boy runs and hides before the irate goblin is untied and after a few hours of hide and seek Boom Boom finds his new nemesis delivering the captains meal. Boom Boom bursts from a nearby barrel he was hiding in and downs one of his many colored vials. Spiders the size of gold coins vomit out of his mouth and a horde of the little horrors begin crawling all over the cabin boy. To which he screams and has a mental breakdown as giant spiders attacked his village when he was young and he's developed a bit of a phobia. After another this was repeated another 2 times, Boom Boom is running a victory lap on the top deck and laughing like a psychopath while the cabin boy is laying in a heap sobbing uncontrollably. After the captain says no more spiders as it interferes to much with the cabin boy's duties Boom Boom decides to settle for vomiting bees at his for the duration of their trip.\n\nThis was the first short session we had with Boom Boom and it was hilarious. Hope you all enjoyed it!",

        "text": "Here's the story of the greatest NPCs I've ever introduced in my campaign.\n\nThe basics: The party is on the island of Ignasi, a colonial territory of the nation of Nevarez. It's contested by the rival nation of Rodia. The Marquis of the island (the highest local authority) has gone missing, and the party is searching for an artifact called the Astrolabe (a planar travel device) to bring him back.\n\nIn the last session [(detailed in my previous post here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4id5k8/everything_a_good_dd_encounter_needs_romance/), a Rodian spy attempted to assassinate the Marquess, hoping her death would send the island into chaos and allow Rodia to invade and easily claim the island. He was killed at the last second by a fourteen-year-old girl named Sinead (actually the most wanted criminal in Ignasi, going by the alias \"Malcer Stormwind\"), who's had a genuine change of heart after disguising herself as the Marquess' friend.\n\nSinead has been trying to take the Astrolabe for herself, and is the only one who knows where the final piece is. She's agreed to help the party locate the missing part (and offer her talents as a thief to steal it from the current owners).\n\nBelow are the major characters and their parts in the story thus far:\n\n**Calypso Megalos** - PC tiefling bard. She's the princess of Rodia. After one of her spies acted without her knowledge and tried to kill the Marquess, she is writing a letter to her father the King explaining the situation. Chances are very good that this will cause a war.\n\n**Elle Bardell/Symon Hane** - PC human ranger. Elle is a loyal citizen of Ignasi, and over the course of the adventure has gained a noble title in reward for her deeds. Using a magic ring to change her sex, she's developed an alternate male persona named \"Symon\" allowing her to disguise herself in service to the Marquess. Being male has also helped her service the Marquess in other ways.\n\n**Rowan, Hand of Tyr** - PC human fighter. A former noble from the Shimmering Isles who recently received word that his family was murdered by a rival clan, the Blackmoors. He took an oath of Tyr and swore vengeance on the Blackmoors and all those who rule as tyrants. He's in love with Princess Calypso, they shared a night of passion in a tavern several weeks before all this.\n\n**Ravella Belmosi** - The Marquess of Ignasi. An Eldritch Knight and a talented strategist, but she's feeling overwhelmed as the sole ruler of the island in her brother's absence. She's deeply indebted to Elle for her service, and now her love.\n\n**Sinead** - An incredibly talented and devious 14-year-old girl who is also the notorious master thief, Malcer Stormwind. While the party was in the capital city, she adopted one of her recurring disguises as Luciana, a friend of the Marquess. She was there for the Rodian spy's assassination attempt, and acted almost instinctively to save the Marquess's life. Sinead's as surprised as anyone to find that her loyalty might have been more than just an act.\n\n**Cicero** - The other Rodian spy invited by Calypso. He was unaware of the assassination plot until right before it happened. As Calypso's childhood friend, his loyalty is a personal bond to her before all else, and he's conflicted knowing that she may end up on the wrong end of the King's wrath.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt the beginning of this session, the party is on the road north towards a mountain known as Vilhjalmur (elvish name: Astitva Sima), home of a temple to an ancient Elvish warrior god and the final piece of the Astrolabe, revered there as a sacred treasure. Sinead researched the legend while hiding at a magic academy, and also has a plan to steal it (and the party is going to help her).\n\nIt's a long road, and the party will stop in the small farming village of Montalvo on the way there.\n\nIn the middle of the night while Elle takes watch, she notices some goblins attacking the party with makeshift explosives. As the party fights them off, an archer shows up to help them finish off the goblins. He's a half-elf, wearing an Ignasian noble's ring (Elle notices it because she happens to be wearing one as well). The archer introduces himself as Felix Elanvir, and says he was travelling with a farmer's caravan to protect them on the road. He heard the explosions and came to see if everyone was alright.\n\nThe party is not very trusting, especially after their rocky relationship with Sinead and the thieves' guild. Even though he claims to be a noble, Felix isn't telling them much about his family, but he seems to be very trusting of all of them and very sincere about helping these commoners reach the next town safely.\n\nThe caravan leader, a farmer from the nearby town of Montalvo, is wary of the travellers, but Felix assures him that these are all people they can trust - especially Baronet Elle Bardell. Elle overhears him saying this, and he seems to think very highly of her considering they just met.\n\nDuring the next day travelling through the woods, the party spots a tiny glint of silver and finds a beautiful ring hung on a twig on a tree branch. It looks like something valuable or significant. Calypso sees that it's shaped to look like a dragon, and she loves dragons, so she's about to put it on when Felix stops her.\n\nHe doesn't think it's a good idea, since he's heard stories about finding mysterious rings in the forest. It could be anything. It could be cursed. He says he doesn't know for sure that this particular ring is cursed, but in stories he's heard, very similar to the current situation, mysterious rings have been cursed. With a little questioning and prodding, he admits he remembers hearing about a ring that caused the wearer's personality and temperament to swing wildly.\n\nCalypso doesn't really trust Felix, so she's about to put the ring on anyway. He acts fast enough to swat it out of her hand, saying he really doesn't think it's a good idea.\n\nThat's when Calypso remembers she has an Identify spell, so she picks up the ring and does that. It's called the Ring of the Restless Heart, and it turns out to be a lot like the one Felix described - it amplifies the wearer's flaws, causes alignment to shift daily, and no one nearby can take a rest or sleep. Also, once it's put on, it can't be removed without magic. If Felix hadn't stopped her, the party would've been in some trouble.\n\nThey're also starting to wonder how Felix knew about this random ring they just found.\n\nElle turns to Sinead, the master thief and expert at disguise, to see if she can uncover anything about Felix, because he's really starting to seem suspicious. Sinead agrees that Felix is pretty sketchy, but she can't figure out what his game is - he's been nothing but friendly to them, and hasn't asked for any money or favors.\n\nSinead goes up ahead to talk to Felix, ask him where he comes from, who his parents are and if she might know them. He's evasive with his answers, before whispering something (that Elle manages to listen in and hear): \"Just know that I'm someone you can trust, Second Lieutenant Kearne.\"\n\nSinead is caught off guard, and falls back to talk to Elle again. She's visibly shaken. There's two possible explanations for Felix, she says: Either Marquess Ravella sent him, or he's someone extremely dangerous. As it turns out, Sinead was offered a choice by Ravella a few days ago before they left town. She could be executed for her crimes, or she could offer her services to Ignasi as a spy. Naturally she chose to not die, and in order to take her new rank, she needed a full name (since she grew up on the streets, she's always just been \"Sinead\" and nothing more).\n\nShe's only had the last name \"Kearne\" for two days, and the only person she's ever told about it is Ravella. There's no way Felix (or anyone else) could have known about it.\n\nElle contacts Ravella via her sending stone. She tells her about Felix Elanvir, how he has a nobleman's signet ring, and asks if Ravella knows anything about him. Ravella's quiet for a while, and then tells her that Elanvir is her elvish mother's maiden name. As far as anyone knows, her late mother was the last of her clan.\n\nNo one's really sure what to make of this. Felix doesn't seem hostile for now, but the entire party has their eyes on him to see what he's planning.\n\nThe party is awoken the next night by the sounds of six gunshots in rapid succession, somewhere in the woods. Rowan's instantly wary about this - Ignasian flintlock pistols only have a single shot each.\n\nCalypso has a pet Faerie Dragon named Mirelth, who travels with the party, carries letters back and forth and generally just acts adorable. She sends him ahead to scout what caused the gunshots, and waits for him to come back.\n\nHe doesn't.\n\nThe party is in a panic now, because they all love Mirelth and don't want anything terrible to happen to him. They're about to draw their weapons and go after him when suddenly a tiefling appears, with Mirelth happily perched on her shoulder.\n\nThere's a few things strange about the tiefling - she's only about 18, she has a large pair of wings, and she's carrying two pistols - revolvers with ornately decorated pearl grips. No one here has ever seen a revolver before.\n\nShe introduces herself as Valencia, and lets Mirelth fly back over to Calypso. She claims she was hunting a bounty in the woods, killed him, and could use some help taking the body back to get her reward.\n\nCalypso's curious to have met another tiefling, like herself. She talks to Valencia, who actually knows who she is. She claims to be one of the spies Calypso sent for - in Calypso's letter, she had requested the codenames \"Alistair\" and \"Valence.\" Valencia says Alistair is waiting for them in Montalvo.\n\nCalypso is shocked to hear this, since her spies \"Alistair\" and \"Valence\" already showed up about a week ago (and \"Valence\" tried to kill the Marquess). She asks Cicero (the original Alistair) if he knows anything about this newcomer, and he's confused and sleepy and says he has never seen this tiefling in his life. The mission to Ignasi was too risky, and no other spies were supposed to come besides him and his former companion.\n\nElle is watching Valencia to see what she's up to. She notices that Valencia sees Felix, he looks at her questioningly, and she makes a motion to be quiet. These two are working together.\n\nElle and Rowan coordinate a sneak attack, grabbing Felix and Valencia from behind, and Calypso pulls her gun on them and demands to know what they're doing here.\n\nValencia sighs, and says: \"You're really not going to want to do that, Mother.\"\n\nEvery player at the table goes quiet.\n\nValencia introduces herself as Lysandra Megalos - daughter of Calypso Megalos. In about eighteen years, Calypso's younger sister invents a time travel spell in order to prevent the war between Rodia and Nevarez.\n\nLysandra explains that she and her twin brother Lucius were sent to the past with the intention of acting independently and never meeting their parents directly. She pulls out a bloodstained, bullet-pierced letter - the one Calypso attempted to send back to Rodia. Before Calypso can get mad, Lysandra reminds her that in about eighteen years, Calypso's the one who tells her to do this.\n\nFelix Elanvir is actually Ben Belmosi - the son of Ravella and Elle. Elle remembers the night she spent with Ravella only a few days ago. \"Ben\" is the name of her dead brother, and the name she knows she would give her son.\n\nIt's about 2 in the morning, Elle contacts Ravella via sending stone to try to explain that she just met their son. Ravella's response is basically a very sleepy and confused \"what?\"\n\nLysandra explains that they have to get to Montalvo to meet up with Lucius. Cullen Blackmoor, one of the sons of the clan that murdered Rowan's family, is planning an ambush in that town to finish the job. In their future timeline, this is where Rowan died.\n\nRowan's wary of walking into Montalvo when Cullen is looking for him, so Elle proposes a solution - he can wear her sex-changing ring to disguise himself, and then they'll get the drop on Cullen instead. Rowan isn't thrilled to be a woman, but he'll do it for his own safety.\n\nWhen they arrive in town, Lysandra runs ahead to meet with Lucius in the agreed location. She brings him back to meet his father. Lucius is a tiefling paladin of Tyr - his features are more human than devil, and he actually looks very much like his father. He took his paladin oath to follow in his father's footsteps and fight against tyranny.\n\nLysandra has a huge grin on her face when she brings back Lucius to meet his father, 'Rosalyn.' She thinks it is absolutely hilarious.\n\nTo make a long story short(ish), they find Cullen Blackmoor surrounded by thugs and assassins. Working together, for the first time ever as a family, the party and their future children brutally curb-stomp them in a hilariously one-sided and heartwarming battle. One of the thugs manages to graze Lysandra with a crossbow bolt and Calypso shoots him multiple times in the face.\n\nRowan takes off the ring so he can fight as himself alongside his son. They team up against Cullen after all his men are dead and beat him within an inch of his life, then interrogate him to find out where the rest of his clan is. Rowan had been planning to kill them all himself, but allows his son to have the final blow. Cullen's head is crushed like a melon.\n\nAfter this, the kids admit the timeline is going to be altered in ways they can't predict - Rowan survived the ambush, and since Rodia's invasion has been prevented (or at least postponed), they will be able to find the last piece of the Astrolabe and rescue Ravella's brother.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo that's how I managed to make all of the sex going on in this campaign actually plot-relevant. My players were really interested in the kids they were eventually going to have, but with the rate at which time passes in this campaign, I knew nine months in-game were going to take even longer in real time. This way they get to be involved in the game other than just \"Calypso is too pregnant to continue being an adventurer.\"\n\nThe kids have joined the party, probably permanently. My players insisted on it. I'm controlling them for roleplay purposes but I gave their character sheets to my players to direct them in combat.\n\nIt's probably the best thing I've ever done for my players, we all absolutely love the kids and it's added so many interesting and convoluted angles to their character relationships.\n\nElle has discovered that her son Ben developed storm-born sorcerer powers as a result of Ravella getting creative with Shocking Grasp and Lightning Lure in the bedroom.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4kf2de/exalted_traitors_rap_battles_and_fertility/",
        "text": "Because guess what?  A new edition of Exalted came out, and we have had NO stories about it!  This; it cannot stand.\n\nDRAMATIC PERSONS (aka the party)\n\nAsmodeus, Bane of the Traitors.  A warrior-priest of the Unconquered Son, bearing his orichalcum mace with the head shaped as a sun that he calls his 'crozius', armor of black jade, and a hatred for the Realm and the Immaculate Faith, who he refers to as \"&amp;lt;series of expletives&gt; TRAITORS.\"  He tends to react violently to said traitors.\n\nThe Tinkerer of the East, a perfectionist craftsman, became a champion of the Unconquered Sun after crafting the perfect bow.  Essentially an socially dysfunctional crafter of the highest calibre in both regards.\n\nMoriko, Songbird of the Kingdoms, a merchant of the Guild, the world-spanning merchant consortium that monopolizes any industry it can and dominated the trade of any industries it can't.  Has hired the other two members of the party for his caravan, and has a standing force of 100 soldiers, former slaves of the guild he freed and convinced to work for him.  Rumored to be able to rend the soul of an attacker with his singing alone.\n\nTHE SETTING:\n\nThe 100 kingdoms, a portion of the world that is a shifting amorphous feudal society and melting pot of cultural influences that gives the GM carte blanche to make up a kingdom for a game to be set in.  In this case, a kingdom who was convinced/blackmailed into allowing in the priests of the Immaculate Faith, who in turn enslaved or imprisoned all of the local gods.\n\nTHE STORY:\n\n\"Ok, ok, ok, this doesn't have to end in violence,\" proclaims Moriko, standing in between Asmodeus and four Immaculate Monks in a cave that held the shrine of an imprisoned local war god Zian Shi. The party had been led here by the last living priestess of Zian Shi (the rest having been violently and permanently suppressed) to free him after having heard of the LAST run in Asmodeus, Bane of the Traitors, had with Immaculate monks.  \"You can leave with your lives, free the war god you've trapped here, and we can all survive this.\"\n\nAs Asmodeus glowered and let his caste mark, that of a sun at its Zenith, burn on his forehead as the Immaculate monks took to their kung fu stances and threatened death upon the anathema, the demons who masqueraded as warriors of the Sun.  The standoff was broken by an arrow fired from the shadows, pinning one of the monks to the wall.  The tension broken, Asmodeus literally pinwheeled into the group of monks, the force of his blows sending each of them crashing to the floor in turn as he countered their flurries of punches and kicks.\n\nEmerging from the shadows next to Moriko, planting an arrow through the neck of one of the Immaculates as they tried to regain their footing, The Tinkerer shrugged.  \"It was illogical to assume any confrontation between Asmodeus and these monks wouldn't end in bloodshed.\"\n\nMoriko was livid, of course.  \"But why did you have to go and fire the first shot?!?\"  \"Expedience.\"  Expedient it was, however well trained the four mortal monks were they stood little chance against the fury of Asmodeus or the well placed arrows of the Tinkerer.  Each of them dispatched in turn, it was a simple matter of a well placed (directed?) flurry of angry uncontrolled strikes from Asmodeus to break into the inner sanctum of Zian Shi, the close proximity of the furious combat in his shrine giving him the strength to break free of the bonds placed on him by the Immaculates.  \n\nAs such, the party was introduced to the local situation; a newly forged small city-state, desperate for allies, invited in the Immaculate Faith hoping it would provide the strength and legitimacy to resist encroaching neighbors.  Having gained entrance and authority, the Immaculates had in turn forced into submission many of the local deities, a goddess of fertility being the main deity made a thrall of the false religion, and those who opposed them like Zian Shi had been imprisoned.  Zian Shi pledged his service to the chosen champions of the Unconquered Sun, and implored them to set to right the divine order in the kingdom and in doing to drive out the Immaculates, preferably in violent conflict.  He was a god of war after all.\n\nAnd so, the party began to plan.  Planning consisting of telling Asmodeus no, smashing the Immaculates heads in couldn't be step 1.  Or 2.  The compromise was step 3.  Step 1) The Tinkerer would take a night to stealthily place decorations, flowers, ribbons, banners, etc all over the only city within the kingdom.  Overnight, it would go from a bland cityscape to a surprise festival celebrating the freeing of the fertility goddess from the thrall of the Immaculate order.  Step 2) Moriko, being musically inclined to a divine level, would dance through the city and whip the populace into a wild party singing a song about how the evil Immaculate monks had imprisoned the fertility goddess and how the Sun had freed her.  Finally, step 3) when the Immaculate temple strikes back against the populace, Asmodeus and the soldiers will emerge from the party, smash them, and destroy the temple of the traitors with much rage and justice.\n\nAnd so, our plan began, with The Tinkerer of the East going completely off the rails as he sneaks through town, randomly nailing banners and baskets full of flowers to random balconies, the residents of said buildings being very tired and confused when they looked to see what was going on.  He couldn't remain undetected forever, of course, and on one rooftop he encountered a woman with blue hair, wearing a blue dress, and appearing quite foreign.\n\n\"You should rest,\" she suggested, motioning to the various decorations that littered the town.\n\n\"But... I'm not done yet.\"  Say what you will, The Tinkerer was dedicated to finishing what he started.\n\n\"But you should take a break at least,\" she said using a level of social fu the awkward and socially disadvantaged Tinkerer couldn't match.  So, he proceeded to whittle a perfect statue replica of her, and presented it to her.  Every fold in the dress, the length of waves of her hair, it was a masterpiece.  Done during a 10 minute coffee break on a whim.  \"You're right, the break was a good idea.  Time to finish!\"  The woman, an important NPC whose name and motivations The Tinkerer didn't even ATTEMPT to get, was left speechless.\n\nThe morning came, and in danced Moriko, Songbird of the Kingdoms singing a song that he had spent all night writing and rehearsing.  Behind him walked Asmodeus and the 100 soldiers, wearing heavy cloaks to hide their armor and weapons, wearing garlands over their hoods.  To look 'festive'.  Subtlety, not Asmodeus' strong suite.\n\nWith the preparations we had made, the surprise party strategy worked like a charm, and the festival erupted full swing as we marched/danced through the streets, Asmodeus and his disciplined soldiers blending as best they could into the crowd until they reached the central plaza, where the Immaculate temple was located.  Contrasted against the rest of the city, no decorations touched the garish pagodas of the Immaculate abbey, and the doors had been barred by the inside.  Smart, given the plan was to get them out of their temple to attack the populace so we could defend them (and appear righteous in the meantime).\n\nAnd so, the festival turned into a party siege, and further performance rolls later, the entire city had picked up the song of the Sun freeing the fertility goddess from the Immaculate monks, with flowers and wreaths being tossed over the walls of the Immaculate temple.  One particularly rude refrain involving what a crumbling pagoda resembled in regards to symbols of infertility finally caused the Abbot of the Immaculates to step out onto the balcony.  A dragonblood, red hue around his skin, staring down at the dancing and singing Moriko, Songbird of the Kingdoms, knowing right away he was an anathema, a demon, a monster, feigning status as a champion of the sun.  Failing his awareness checks miserably, he didn't see the not very well disguised Asmodeus standing nearby.\n\nJumping down off the pagoda and doing a superhero landing, the impact on the ground causing a crater and throwing up shattered tiles, standing slowly with a fire starting to form around him as his anima began to flare, his body taking up the pose of his fire dragon martial arts style.  To his surprise Moriko's songing started to take on a very different pacing and tone, and with some shock he realized that Moriko was not the helpless singer as appearances would suggest.  Instead, Moriko practiced Voice of the Nightingale style, a style of martial art to turn your very voice into a weapon, or in the case of Moriko, a weaponized song.\n\nThe appearance of the Abbot had caused the crowd to scatter and form a wide circle around him and Moriko, but from deep within the crowd came a loud, deep voice, the shout seeming to reverberate through the square.  \"EPIC RAP BATTLES OF CREATION!!!!  SONGBIRD OF THE KINGDOMS, VERSUS, A DUMBASS IMMACULATE!  BEGIN!\"\n\nMoriko, taking advantage of the surprise the voice from the crowd had caused, launched into a song inmediately, \"SCREW YOU YOU BIG BALD CUNT, I'M OF THE HEAVENS AND THE SUN, LEGIT ON BOTH FRONTS!  MY SONGS WITH CRUSH YOUR AFFRONTS, SWEEP YOUR LEGS OUT FROM UNDER YOUR BUM, I TAKE THE SONGS OF MY PEOPLE AND BREAK ALL OF YOUR FUN!\"  The lines were delivered with such force that the Abbot had to dig his heels into the ground, almost being blown backwards by the force of the noise itself, hitting him like a sonic boom.\n\nRealizing he had to end the battle quickly, as the song itself caused the people to shout and cheer like they were watching a musical competition,  the Abbot's power flared and his energy eruped like a volcano, the heat of it melting the rubble from his landing into a molten puddle.  He charged forwards, his fist reared back into a haymaker punch, when he felt another force strike him in the side, parrying his very charge, and a sudden uppercut from a cudgel of some kind sending him cartwheeling back.  \"Who... Who was that?!?  Who dare interrupts my smiting of the anathema?!?\" He cried.\n\nThe answer followed the absurd trend.  \"U-N-C...\" A chant started from cloaked individuals peppered throughout the crowd, \"I WIELD THE LIGHT PROPERLY,\" the deep voice from earlier belted out.  \"S-U-N...\" \"WITH THE SUN THERE'S NO STOPPING ME!\"  Throwing off his cloak, Asmodeus himself stepped out from the crowd, crozius in hand, righteous fury in his eyes as his anima banner, his energy made manifest, formed shards of broken sword blades and hilts, raining down around him.\n\nRoaring a challenge and a cry for help, the Abbot's acolytes started attempting to leap over the walls of the temple to join the conflict, only to have arrows zip from the far side of the square pinning the monks to the wall, The Tinkerer sitting passively in his hiding spot on the balcony of a building, his gillie suit of flowers helping him hide amongst his decorations as he fired arrow after arrow to keep the mortal monks from joining the conflict.\n\nBefore the Abbot could comprehend exactly how trapped he was, Moriko unleashed another verse on him, the crowd cheering and delirious over the sick burns being dealt to the monk made of fire, the Abbot's rage driving him to make another mad rush towards Moriko, only to be stopped by Asmodeus once more, broken swords spraying out from the impact of his Crozius on the monk's chest, sending him tumbling back once more.  \n\n\"WHO WON?  WHO IS VICTORIOUS?\"  Yelled out Asmodeus, to which the crowd started chanting Songbird!  Songbird!  Grinning, Asmodeus approached the Abbot, spinning his crozius in a lazy circle to his side.  The Abbot, to his credit, was trying to stand once more, but he could barely get to one knee before Asmodeus took his crozius in two hands and did a Happy Gilmore-esque swing, smashing the Abbot so hard he flew back into the barred door of the Immaculate temple like a cannonball, breaking it down and into the inner courtyard of the temple.\n\n\"Party inside the Immaculate temple!!!!\" Moriko yelled out to the crowd, who wasted no time at all in rushing past Asmodeus to desecrate the holy ground and spread the wild festivity inside it.  \n\nAsmodeus turned back to Moriko, heartbroken.  \"But... But... I wanted to smash the traitor temple!\"",

The ride back to the village was uneventful, and when we got there there was just a few minutes before the scheduled time to arrive at the abandoned tavern. We heard indistinct mumbling from inside the tavern, and we went inside to see about twenty villagers sitting inside. Coraim jumped up on a table and began to make a speech about freedom, justice, etc. After several failed diplomacy rolls, he was about to give up. \n\nJust then, a group of three adventurers burst in. We recognized them from the first adventure, where we were commissioned to clear a dungeon and give them the credit. We had forgot to give them credit, and we thought they were back for revenge. It turned out that they had actually been hired by the king to kill us and end the revolution. \n\nIaghar went hand to hand with Arnold the stupid fighter, and Lexter went after Ray the sorcerer with a viper familiar. Vido and Coraim... Well, they didn't really do much. Iaghar eventually took down Arnold after dodging multiple attacks from Jeff the cleric. Jeff had a ridiculous number of healing spells prepared, and we couldn't seem to get him at low hit points... Until Lexter cast Mage Hand... On Jeff's man berries. he collapsed groaning. A few turns later, Lexter did it again... He rolled a natural 20 and completely crushed Jeff's testicles. After the fight, the villagers were very inspired, and ready for a fight.\n\nSadly, Coraim said that we had to draft a constitution first. So some guy wrote \"freedum, justus, libertee\" on a piece of paper. (We now call him Justus Man. His real name is Robert.)\n\n After everybody had signed the constitution, Vido took some people who said they were stealthy. The volunteers were Justus Man, and a pair of elven twins. After the elven twins beat Vido up multiple times while he was testing them, Coraim, Vido and Justus Man all took a liking to the female, Michella. (Her brother was Michael.) Coraim got sucker punched.\n\nWhile this was happening, Iaghar was doing hand to hand combat with a couple of others to see who would make a good lieutenant to the star-crossed Coraim. There were several drunks and a really fat guy, but one former monk completely wrecked Iaghar.\n\nShall Michella and and Coraim have a budding romance? Or will she choose Vito once and for all? Or perhaps Justus Man. Has Lexter made a habit of exploding peoples balls with Mage Hand? Is there anything more sad than falling for an NPC in D&amp;D? Find out next time on \"Oh My God Why Did I Do This!?\"\n\nNote: I made our DM write today's story instead of me. I didn't want to.",

        "text": "So at my college I’m in the Carrion Crown Adventure path for Pathfinder. I’m playing a Halfling Alchemist by the name of Martin. Martin is a very, very curious fellow. Dead spider? See if you can extract the poison to tinker around with. Find a weird clay like blob? Use random chemicals to see if it’ll react. You see, he has no sense of protection or common sense or both. Something blows up as he’s working on? His usual reaction will be “Oh well now I know” or “Can I do that again…”.\n\nWe were halfway through the campaign and we were playing over skype and Roll20 for the session. We were exploring the Harrowstone Prison and found a room that had a furnace in it. One of the party members had suggested looking into the furnace to see if we could find anything that could be cleansed. Me, being the ever curious Halfling I am, stepped forward and volunteered. \n\nSo I approach the furnace and poke my head into it. All of a sudden a flaming skull appears before me and before I can react it lashes out a flaming tongue at me.\n\nGM: “Now don’t freak out but you take 100 points of damage.”\n\nMe (OOC): “…Well…”\n\nGM: “Now can you hop out of the skype call until I give you the word to rejoin.”\n\nSo I exit out of the call and I’m watching the screen as everyone starts to roll. I’m sitting there confused. I had died but they were rolling. My first thought was “Did my body get possessed or something?” until the GM messages me over roll20 with a side roleplaying opportunity as something is happening in the prison.\n\nI found myself in a rather misty area with a strange ethereal woman before me. She’s trying to convince me that I’m dead. That I’ve been long dead for several months and my companions have moved on without me. A part of me is finding this fishy and I start bantering back and forth with her. I try telling her that I’m going to leave and rejoin my friends. She tells me that they’ve forgotten me and I won’t be happy. This continues for several minutes as she would occasionally flicker. With my suspicions growing I push forward and deliver this.\n\n\"True, they do. But you have to make your own happiness. And there are two things that bring me happiness, my friends and my first love.\"\n\nI push forward, a grin upon my lips. \"Now ma'am...I have no clue what you are. I don't care what you are. But let me tell you what my first love is...alchemy. To be able to use science to unravel the secrets of the universe and not rely upon the fickle nature of the gods. And if I'm in some god or goddess's holy domain and I have to blast my way to freedom with the power of science, so be it.\"\n\n\"And I still have one last bomb that I'm willing to use to get out of here and back with my friends.\"\n\nAt this point the GM tells me to rejoin the skype call. My character awakens to everyone leaning over him, shouting at him to wake up. The GM informs me that I have actually only taken 15 points of damage.\n\nWizard: “You missed second dinner Martin!”\n\nMe: “…Why does my everything hurt?”\n\nInquisitor: “You see when the skull took you down weird chains appeared on your body. We took down the skull and started to remove chains from your form.”\n\nMe: “Can we leave…go back home for the night…sleep…. get second dinner.”\n\nWizard: “I agree with that.”\n\nThe session ended with us leaving Harrowstone and returning back to the town to rest for the night.\n \n",

        "text": "I'm writing while tired, please forgive me for any errors in spelling or grammer.\n\nFor those of you who don't know Town of Salem, it's a PC game where they took elements of the tabletop games such as Mafia, Werewolf and other such people reading games and through them into a Blender.\n\nGames go like this, you get a role out of what seem like 40 roles, with unique abilities for each, 15 players. I'll explain the important ones as necessary . For the Most part you don't know other people roles.\n\nTo Win: You have to work out who has the Roles that are on your team and get the other teams/groups killed.\n\nTwo phases, Day Phase and Night Phase. \n\nDay Phase, everyone can talk to each other in public(Whisper to other players if needed) and you can vote on people to lynch/remove them for the game if you want.\n\nNight Phase, It's when most people can use their abilities and when most people die.\n\nSo I was the Mayor(A Town Role), my 2nd game ever in this role for full disclosure.\n\nThe Mayor's ability is one of the few that can be used during the day. The Mayor can REVEAL that they are the Mayor to everyone, but after they do, they cannot be saved by a Doctor(Self explanatory role). The perk of revealing oneself and painting the giant red X on your back is that when you vote to lynch, it counts as 3 votes instead of 1. \n\nThis story doesn't make much use of that perk. I used the ability as a completely different perk... that drew a lot of hate and anger. I feel it paid off in the end, but  I will let you judge via my biased point of view.\n\nNow at this point its important to know, I like some of the achievements for this game, I find them cool. One Achievement is Fearless.\n\nFearless: Reveal yourself as Mayor on Day 1.\n\nI Achieved Fearless.\n\nI'll let that sink in, by revealing that I had given myself a lot of power at the cost of the other 4-5 evil roles wanting to squash that power ASAP.\n\nThe reason is, once people know you are good, certain roles can quite easily prove to you that they are good too, so you can start a process of elimination quite fast.\n\nThis is where I became the WORST. Only some roles could prove to me that they were definitively good. Everyone expected me to be their friend, because I was good! I had that power. When I didn't trust them with information, I was the WORST.\n\nDay 1 only lasts a couple of seconds and you don't have time for much, that is good because the game can't really kick off until after Night 1 when some murders happen.\n\nNight 1, I was Jailed, the Jailor was protecting me from dying there and then, since you can't be killed in Jail. Jailor could also speak to me one on one. Finally if the Jailor doesn't trust the prisoner, they can choose to execute them. The Jailor Could trust me since I revealed myself, and since I knew I was definatly talking to the Town Jailor, when he said his name was Bej, I knew that I had my first Ally that I could Trust.\n\nDay 2: Few Died, that's not important to the story being told, what is was what I then said, \"Whisper your roles to me\"\n\nI opened the flood gates and immediately started taking notes. Now I don't know if you know what its like when 14 people try to have a conversation with you at the same time, all giving reasons why they are good, but its hard to keep track of.\n\nSo I started collecting Data and recording it from the whispers to look for inconsistencies. This went on for the next 3 day rounds. Bej kept me protected.\n\nI Was able to ensure a few others where defiantly good at this point. Now here is the thing, 3 day rounds in this game is a long time to get your act together, but it was this constant barrage on information I was having to make sense of. So not only was I not trusting anyone, but I was the WORST according to half the group.\n\nOver the last 3 days this one guy had kept hounding me with CAPS locks( like everyone else I might add because each one of them was the most important) But this guy, James Russel, claimed he was a Vigilante(Vig).\n\nVigilantes at night can choose to take the law into their own hands and shoot someone. If they shoot someone innocent, they suicide the next night.\n\nNow the only proof I had that he was a Vig, was his claim. But he kept demanding information from me and I didn't have enough info as to weather I could trust him.\n\nSo he threatened to shoot me because I'm the WORST and this is my last chance. Something about me, Peer Pressure and demands have the opposite effect on me, and I will cut off my nose to spite my face given such a situation, a character flaw I know. I also thought, \"wow this guy must feel small in real life\". So I said, \"Come at me Bro\"...\n\nAnd James carried through with the threat, so now I'm a ghost and everyone is angry at him. So he would then go on to suicide the next night since the game rules. He, however, would not get the chance to gloat via ghost chat, because of Big Oil. \n\nBig Oil was a Retributionist(Ret), which I had worked out. Rets could revive dead players. So I'm back and still the WORST. but being dead for a day allowed me some time to finally get my head around all the information.\n\nAnd so working with those I trusted I was able to start saying, this guy has an inconsistency, lynch them tomorrow. We started systematically lynching the evil roles in town, but I wasn't making it obvious to the town that's what I was doing so I was the WORST. \n\nMostly it was just Bej who hadn't called me the WORST at this point as it took me a while to trust the others.\n\nNow one Evil role is the Witch, who can use thier powers to control one player to perform their action on another player. The witch was throwing everyone at me apparently, but the Bej had me covered, untill the Witch threw Bej at me, and I was executed in Jail. But not before I had worked out who the Witch was and told Bej, who immediately revenged me.\n\nI was dead again. James is gloating. I don't know why I was responding to him uselessly as everyone KNOWS IM THE WORST and all the Dead Ghosts had his back. James's ego increased, he is probably 12.\n\nNow during the past game there was a guy called Swat who also knew I was the WORST. I could trust Swat because he proved he was the Medium to me the last time I had been dead.\n\nThe Medium can talk to ghosts at night.\n\nSo through him I was able to get the last bit of information out to him as to the last evil doer in town, and he only believed me because all of the ghosts suddenly went. Oh yeah... that makes a lot of sense. James was somewhere in the background telling me I was wrong. Everyone ignored him.\n\nThey Lynched the target who was the final Evil and the town won. Which means I won.\n\nEveryone promptly declared I was the WORST and left the game.",

        "text": "Last time I told you all the tale of how [the party rogue (Cut) saved the party sorcerer (Oren) and subsequently raised the ire of a terminator blooded shopkeep](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4i6sma/the_party_rogue_pissed_off_a_shopkeep_that_was/).  This time it is the ballad of the god-dogs.\n\nThis is a Pathfinder game.\n\nThe party had found a goblin stronghold and felt reasonably confident about their chances.  With six PCs and a friendly NPC along (the local ranger who hated goblins named Shalelu) they had every right to.  But things started to go bad pretty quickly.  Squabbling and disagreements sent Cut exploring a way to sneak by the external fortifications (an overly grand term, to be sure) and the party druid (Ahbet) walking through the bramble walls of the goblin 'fortifications'.  Meanwhile, the most recently joined PC was paranoid and reluctant to jump into the fray.  So the remaining three PCs and NPC launched a plan most cunning.\n\nThey would set an ambush and then the fastest of them would rush ahead and lure the attention of some foolish goblins.  Their devilish machinations didn't account for two things: First, this isn't an MMO.  Second, that the gods themselves had taken an interest in their downfall.  The party ranger (Enyala) volunteered to lure the goblins, only to run across a quartet of goblin dogs.  She decided that was close enough, attacked and made ready to run.  But dogs are quick, and these beasts were favored greatly.  In their many attacks that night, they missed only twice, and in all their attacks, they never rolled below max damage.  In that first round they took down and nearly killed the ranger.  The rest of the group (in the ambush) rushed to her aid, managing to prevent the dogs from killing her in the next run.  It was a heroic charge that left the group horribly out of position.  The next round, the god-dogs took down the party paladin (Vigor), leaving only Oren and Shalelu to face the very font of divine hate.\n\nAnd they did, with aplomb.  They did not falter, though their gods had clearly turned away.  Oren bathed them in flame (burning hands) and Shalelu actually slew one.  The others were not idle, however, Cut had finally arrived, hearing the desperate pleas of his friends.  Ahbet had been dueling a goblin druid and his animal companion, but that fight was drawn to the god-dogs, and soon the goblin druid cast grasping vines (entangle) over the lot.  Of course, the god-dogs were unaffected, such was their sanction, but most of the PCs resisted as well.\n\nIt was only the dogs that had divine guidance, though, the goblin druid was fought to a standstill by Ahbet and Shalelu while Oren, Cut, and Ahbet's companion tiger (N'sasi) managed to down the remaining god-dogs, suffering only a comparatively light savaging in the process.  Once they were down, the druid could not resist the PC's fury, and he died a coward.\n\nIn the end, there were two unconscious PCs (Enyala and Vigor), two critically wounded PCs (Cut and Oren), with Ahbet and N'sasi suffering only moderately terrible injuries.  Shalelu, and Thorne were undamaged.  You may have forgotten about Thorne, which is understandable, but I am given to know that he collected several fine examples of sunflowers despite the low level of sunlight under the canopy.",

        "text": "I've been a part of this subreddit (read: lurking in) for quite some time, so I've felt that I should contribute my own misadventures in my campaign for a while.\n\nFor context, I met this group a while before I even knew they played D&amp;D.  Somehow, it came up and I was invited into a Roll 20 campaign with them.  Having been interested in D&amp;D, but never having played it before, I accepted.  Most of the campaigns are homebrewed, each player owning an \"island\", of which they are the DM, where the party travels to in order to advance the plot and solve whatever problems are on that island.  I came in partway through one island, so I can only show my perspective, and might not have the full details on something.  Also, this was quite some time ago, so I might not remember the details I do know too clearly.\n\nBut without further ado, let's start with the cast of characters, as there are a few of them.\n\nKriv Oathbreaker (my character):  LG Dragonborn Fighter.  Banished from his island after failing to prevent an assassination attempt on his charge, who just so happened to be the prince, and next in line for the throne.  Has a bit of an honor complex, and seems to act like the mother hen of his new \"family\".\n\nCretin: NG Half-siren Warden.  A well meaning, but often clumsy sort.  He was born with a pair of wings that don't work, which is a bit of a sore point for him.  Doesn't know his true heritage.  Has a tendency to roll poorly for combat and adventuring, but crits rolls that have to with mundane tasks.\n\nFerr:  NG Human Ranger.  The grouch of the group.  Constantly butting heads with Cretin.  Tends to act rashly, and has a bit of a temper.  He means well, even if he doesn't quite know how to say it.  Is played by the current DM during this story.\n\nCera Mageslayer: Mute CG Elf Rogue.  The character who you should be worried of when you hear the words \"can I...\"  Will flip off of anything/anyone, bust through walls to tackle people, and use anything she can get her hands on as a weapon.  Not allowed near oars anymore without a proper target.  Usually drunk, or looking for a drink.\n\nChar: TN Elf Druid.  A flame druid from the sacred tribe of \"Virginia\", he was given a cursed torch which couldn't actually burn anything, and sent off to collect the sacred flames of his people that were scattered about the world.  One of the only players whose plot-points are remembered/used throughout the islands.  Holds on to the belief of preservation of nature through superior firepower.  He's friendly, but also a bit awkward.\n\nZar: NG Halfing Rogue.  Part of a secret organization of Rogues and Thieves who go after worse Rogues and Thieves, he is supplied with a vast information network, and a seemingly endless array of shuriken.  Often overthinks things when the more compulsive members of the party have already screwed up his plans.\n\nHarg:  Half-Orc Barbarian.  Originally an NPC, another one of our friends who actually joined after I did.  He joined the party after being (accidentally) broken out of jail.  He was given a mysterious backstory, and an orc-hating complex after being picked up by the player.  Also a frequent target of Ferr, who also hates orcs.\n\nIf that weren't enough, we also have a slew of NPC's who follow us on our quest.\n\nYinn:  A Dragonborn Child that the party ~~kidnapped~~... rescued.  She's often joked OOC that she will surpass the party and become the savior of all.  Is doted on both IC and OOC by everyone.\n\nInu/Enu:  An illiterate, belligerent Gnoll pirate, whose crew was mind controlled into mutiny.  Was saved by the party, and is being used basically as a taxi service to island hop.\n\nBrainy:  Unwaveringly loyal Kobold first mate to Inu, and the only member of Enu's crew to resist the mind control.  Doesn't speak Common, and is often used as Inu's slave/punching bag.\n\nIsamora:  dwarven ice sorc, and drinking buddy to Cera.  Babysits Yinn when the party is out adventuring.  Vehemently argues with Char as they get along about as well as... well, ice and fire.\n\nAnd with that, we may begin the story.\n\nUnsure of how to introduce my character in the middle of the ocean, we spitball a couple of ideas.\n\nVery shortened version of the conversation\n\nMe:  I suppose it would be too easy to show up in my little rowboat.\n\nDM:  Well, the party *did* just find a sunken ship in the middle of the ocean.\n\nMe: [MFW](https://media.giphy.com/media/PFwKHjOcIoVUc/giphy.gif)\n\nSo we start the session.  The party is just recovering from a battle with merfolk, after Cretin rolled a 1 trying to fish.\n\nThey decide who will go down into the depths to raid the ship.  Cretin can't swim, Cera is too drunk, and Char has his torch, so that leave Zar and Ferr.\n\nGroup:  So how far down is the ship?\n\nDM:  *rolls* It'll take about two turns for you to get down there.\n\nG: And how big is it?\n\nDM: *rolls nat 20* It's actually a decent sized ship.  Should be a lot of loot down there for you.  Speaking of rolls, though.  *rolls nat 1* Kriv, you have about four turns of air left down there.\n\n[MFW](http://giphy.com/gifs/reactiongifs-LRVnPYqM8DLag)\n\nSo OOC, I'm panicking that I might lose my character before the rest of the party sees him.\n\nIC, the party decides that swimming would be too slow of a way to grab the ~~new party member~~ Loot.  So after discussion, they decide to hold onto the warden's weapon, a giant anchor, tie a rope to it so the others can haul them back to the surface afterwards, and shoot it through a 'crossbow' that would be better described as a ballista.\n\nThe plan works, and they manage to get down in record time.  They search the ship and manage to find several treasure chests.\n\nKriv, in the captain's quarter, which has miraculously remained clear of water, hears the commotion outside and decides to venture out.  He's surprised to see, not sharks or other sea life, but two adventurers swimming about looking for sunken treasure.  The two are surprised to see a Dragonborn swim out of a ship that had to have been underwater for weeks.  Ferr signals that they should all surface, and they do so.\n\nBack out of Character, the DM decides it's time for a bit of backstory on Kriv and the ship.\n\nDM:  So how did you manage to get that big ship by yourself?  Surely an outcast wouldn't be given such a large vessel for himself?\n\nMe:  No, of course not.  I *was* given a tiny rowboat, but then I was attacked by pirates.  Of course, they were no match for a trained soldier, so I proved too much of a Bad ass for them.\n\nDM: [Mhm...](http://giphy.com/gifs/anchorman-lies-lie-EouEzI5bBR8uk)  And so why did you sink?\n\nCretin's Player:  Well, it sounds like something Char would do in his wild, younger days.  He blew up the ship for their using wood!\n\nChar's Player:  Hm?  Oh, yeah, that's totally something he would have done.\n\nSo, we laughed about it for a while, but it somehow became canon.\n\nMeanwhile, back in game, introductions are made, minus Zar, who has jumped back down to secure the loot.  Kriv apparently has great eyesight and memory, as he nails every check to remember that Char was the one who bombed his ship.\nFrom the back of a pterodactyl.\nIn his 'wild, younger days'.\nSeveral weeks ago.\n\nKriv nearly goes ballistic, arguing not of his own safety, as he views himself as worthless at this point, but at the possible loss of others lives.\n\nThey manage to calm him down enough for Char to apologize, though, in time for Zar to come back, telling everyone to help him pull the treasure up.\n\nAfter securing the loot, Cretin agrees to spar with Kriv, partially to make sure that Kriv is still in shape after weeks of imprisonment, but mostly so that I can learn combat.  Zar and Char decide to join in, too.  Zar to see how I handled myself, and Char because it sounded fun and everyone was doing it.\n\nCretin and Kriv face off, and Cretin allows Kriv the first hit.  I roll well for initiative, but miss my attack.  Cretin hits, but for minimal damage.\n\nThen it rolls around to Char, who crits.\n\nSo the Elf who blew up my ship, forcing me to sit at the bottom of the ocean for weeks, walks up during a friendly sparring match and punches me in the eye.\n\nKriv is not pleased.\n\nHowever, he can't do much about it, as a pattern is soon shown.  Kriv misses every attack, fails every escape attempt for grapples, and just generally bumbles around.\n\nEventually, Cera, who had by now found the liquor, drunkenly engages the group, immediately rolls a 1, and shoves an oar through the deck, causing enough racket that an enraged Enu forces everyone below deck.\n\nSo, after a rather awkward first encounter, Kriv meets the party that he will eventually learn to call, friends.  Sorry for the length, and let me know if you guys want to hear any more.",

Just shy of seven feet tall with a stocky frame. He was paler than most humans, with his skin showing only a slight crisp of brown from exposure to the sun. He had shoulder length brown hair and green eyes. His build and armor, splint mail, with an image of a black knight fighting a dragon crafted into the breastplate, led me believe he was a fighter or soldier of some sort. He was certainly armed like one. A bastard sword strapped to his back, two axes clasped to his hips, and a majestic silver great sword clenched in his hand.\n\nThe second was a tiefling, who straggled nervously behind. He was average height, though he walked with a slouch, as if he was in a constant state of trying to avoid being seen. He had dark, crimson colored skin with two medium sized horns jutting from his forehead just before the deep black of his hairline took over. Under his elegant elven chain mail, he wore dark colored robes, tunic and trousers, and carried a large satchel across his chest. From what I could see the only weapons he had were a bow and quiver across his back and a rapier at his hip.\n\nThe two of them stood there, looking at the three of us chained to the wall. Cragdor, the dwarf, the waifish child Maracella, and myself. “Who are you and what are you doing here?” asked the bulky looking brawler in a frank, even keel tone, while his partner, the tiefling, focused all his attention on Maracella. Not in a typical, leering way most men look at women, but in a look of genuine concern, that honestly caught me off guard.\n\nOnce again, Cragdor was the first to speak. “My name is Cragdor! I’ve been a prisoner here for many days. I’m just an innocent merchant brought here and tortured by the minions of Tallis. I….”\nBut before the rambling dwarf could continue, he was cut off mid-sentence by the brawler, whose voice had lost it’s even keel. “Tallis!? Did you say Tallis!? Is she here!?” He raised his massive longsword, not threateningly toward any of us, mind you, but as if he had every intention of using it in the immediate future.\n\nThe threat of such an ominous looking weapon was enough to rattle the dwarf. “I….I...don’t know. I’ve only seen her minions. Four of them.”\n\nAt that, the tiefling leaned over to his companion. “He must be talking about the four we ran into in the kitchen.”\n\n“Yes, yes! That would be them! Are they dead?” pleaded Cragdor.\n\n“No.” The tiefling stated plainly, yet under his breath I heard him mutter with a slight smirk, “Though knowing our companions, they will be soon.”\n\n“I want to know where Tallis is!” the brawler finally huffed.\nMaracella shrank away from his raised voice while Cragdor tried to calm him “Please, kind sir, I’ve told you..”\n\n“Cut me down and I’ll tell you everything you need to know.” I abruptly chimed in. The brawler lumbered a few feet toward me, gripping his sword tightly with gloved fist. “Who are you? And what can you tell me?”\n\n“I’m the one who can find you Tallis. I know the layout of the house. Every room.” I lied. “Until you get me down that’s all you need to know.” It was a gamble bluffing this massive brute, but something about that blazing look of obsession behind his eyes at the mere mention of Tallis name told me it was worth the risk.\n\nWith one swift and powerful swing of his sword, the metal chains that had held me captive for so long, were shattered like pieces of glass. I clutched my aching wrists and breathed in a deep sigh of relief.\n\nThen, I crawled on my hands and knees, still wobbly from being chained for so long, and clamored over to the food. I reached for the plate of food and grabbed the closest bit of refreshment that wasn’t covered in rot, a surprisingly ripe and red apple, and let my teeth sink into it and allow it’s succulent juices to drip down my chin.\n\nThe large beast of a man stood towering before me, his patience waning, “Now, your name.”\n\n“You ask alot of questions. I don’t know you. You could be worse than those wretched minions, or even spies sent to lull us into submission by this blasted cult.” I said, bluffing some more, testing my boundaries. He lowered his sword, and the tone of his voice, to a more reasonable cadence. “My name is Christoph Lundgren, little one, and I swear on the name of my family that I and the rest of my party are the ever vigilant enemies of this cult and it’s minions. And I assure you, that neither I, nor my friend, Xavier, here, mean you or any of the rest of these captives any harm. Now, if you please, your name and what you’re doing here.”\n\nI sat comfortably on the hard stone floor, back propped against a bag of sundries, and smiled broadly up at him, trusting his words. “My name is David, and while I don’t typically tell people my profession upon first meeting, you more than likely just saved my life. I am a thief. I was here to steal something of great value and stumbled upon the inner workings of this lodge and got myself captured. What the dwarf says is true. Those minions belong to Tallis, and yes, I believe she is here now, or was recently. I even believe I know which room is hers.”\n\n“What were you trying to steal?” the tiefling, Xavier, said inquisitively, jotting down notes and awaiting my answer.\n\n“Hmmph” I thought silently to myself.”A bard.”\n\n“A suit of armor in the first floor parlor.” I sighed. “Truth be told, it’s a Helmed Horror I was tasked with retrieving, and if you don’t mind, I’d like to do just that before leaving. It’s a large payday I’d like to collect and it could prove essential to our escape.”\nXavier and Christoph shared an uneasy look, full of nervous eye rolls and gritted teeth.\n\n“One of you touched it, didn’t you?” I asked, already assuming the answer was ‘yes’.\n\n“The great tentacled beast that lie dormant within attacked our party after a fool dwarf we brought along with us made the mistake of touching it, yes. I’m afraid we had to put it down.” said Christoph somewhat apologetically.\n\n“How were you going to get it out of here, if you don’t mind me asking?” The tiefling pondered aloud.\n\n“An incantation that would transfer over it’s power and ownership to me.” I answered.\nWith a breath of giddiness and a quick scribbling of notes the tiefling giggled “I didn’t know that was possible.”\n\n“It might not have been, but it was worth a shot for the money I was offered. I don’t suppose the armor itself is still in tact? I could possibly make a profit on it still if it has remnants of any magical properties.” I almost pleaded as I imagined that 20,000 gold pieces flittering out of my grasp.\n\n“Oh, no. It imploded.” Xavier stated nonchalantly, as he continued scribbling.\n\n“Please, sir. Can you get us down now?” Maracella wept, which finally drew the bard’s attention to something other than his damned notes. Almost embarrassed that he seemed to have forgotten the other captives, Christoph let loose with another mighty swing that took out the remaining chains and freed them.\n\n“You, dwarf...Cragdor was it? Can you walk?” Christoph asked as he helped lift Maracella up. The dwarf gave the brute a docile nod, afraid to look him in the eye.\n\n“Here, I’ll take her. You may need your hands free if the trouble upstairs has escalated.” Xavier said to Christoph as he allowed Maracella to lean on his shoulder, still having trouble carrying her own weight after weeks of brutality and lack of food.\n\nI waved off Christoph’s attempt at assisting me up as kindly as possible. He nodded and looked over the rag tag brood before him, one hand on his hip and another still clutching the impressive silver longsword.\n\n“Alright” Christoph began “Once we get upstairs, there is a strong chance of danger.” The tiefling holding the girl tried to muffle his giggling, as if he was in a constant state of knowing things no one else knew. Christoph just shot him a sideways glance and continued “If you are unfit to fight, just stay out of the way.”\n\n“I am fit enough, but my gear is nowhere to be seen.” I stated plainly. Xavier, still trying to cater to Maracella, reached behind his back and pulled out his bow and quiver. He handed them to me and asked “Are you a capable shooter?”\n\nThe bow was slightly larger than what I was used to, but I knew I could make it work, so I simply slung the quiver across my bloody, bruised and sore back and shot the tiefling an appreciative smile.\n\nINTO THE FIRE\n\nOnce we reached the top of the stairs from the dungeon and entered the massive kitchen, the scene was chaotic.\n\nThere was a shattered window, with a slight hint of blood on the broken glass, and the dissipating effects of what I can only assume was a fog bomb (having used them myself on a few occasions, I felt strong about that assumption).\n\nIn the epicenter of the sprawling room stood an elf. He was tall, though slightly shorter than most elves I have come across. He must be a half blood. Yet, he had the same pointed ears, pale blue, almost white eyes, and long flowing hair, raven black, shared by his full blooded brethren. His wiry, athletic frame was garbed in leathers and woolen tunic and trousers, dyed in a deep earthen green and brown forest tones. Ranger colors. He had a large bow, slung across his back with a full quiver, and a curved sword, medium length in his hand.\n\nHe stood there, holding the point of his blade at the throat of what had to be the creepiest little human child I had ever seen, who, for her part, seemed to care very little about the threat of an opened jugular. In fact, I would say her expression was that of just minor annoyance.\n\nShe stood less than five feet tall to within an inch, was brazened in the half plate armor I have known many a paladin to favor and had close cropped black hair. I would have easily mistaken her for an adolescent if not for the inordinately large breasts she somehow managed to carry on her otherwise slender frame. As impressive as those were, though, what struck me the most were those eyes. They were like looking into an abyss. Cold, empty, and potentially hiding something very deadly behind them.\n\nI was also slightly startled by the dagger in her hand, still dripping with blood.\n\nI followed the crimson droplets from the blade to the floor where the body of one of Tallis’ minions lay slaughtered. I say slaughtered because the stab wounds were erratic and multiple. These weren’t calculated attacks, these were simply the wounds inflicted by someone who wanted to ensure certain, painful death. There were two minions, bound, kneeling, and trembling not far from where their companion was slain, blood splatter still fresh on their faces and robes.\n\nAlso in the room was a tall dark skinned man, human, with short hair and a scruff jawline beard. He was elaborately fashioned in regal looking robes. Beside him was a heavily cloaked figure of medium height and build, his face cloaked behind the shadow of his dark colored hood. There were many ornate chains and medallions draped across his neck, many seemed to be of religious origin. Was he a druid perhaps? There was also another dwarf, this one stockier and more stoutly built than Cragdor, with a large pack of cooking supplies slung heavy across his back.\n\nThey stood cagey and nervous a few feet away, seemingly like those of us fresh from the dungeon, not knowing what to make of the scene. “Friends of yours?” I asked the tiefling next to me, with more of a perplexed and somewhat insulting tone than I had intended.\n\n“Associates, yes.” Xavier responded, as he gently helped Maracella to a seated position in the corner. I could have, personally, done without his coddling nature and his incessant giggling, humming and singing, but the way he seemed to protectively place his thin frame in between Maracella and the current insanity taking place just yards away was almost admirable, and seemed to help calm her frazzled nerves. The way he shied away from using the word “friends” to describe his compatriots was also very telling of the group’s dynamic.\n\nAs I motioned to look back toward the larger group I noticed Cragdor scurrying out of the room through the hallway door. Can’t say I blame him really, considering his recent treatment at the hands of these minions.\n\nThe half elf finally spoke, with utter contempt in his voice “Why did you do that? Answer me now.” His blade unflinching at the girl’s throat. “We have no time to deal with captives. We are trespassers here and with that one you let get away, you’d be fool to believe he won’t be returning in force. Killing them now saves us from having to potentially fight them later.” the girl said in a cool and eerily passive tone, with logic that, while detached and unsympathetic, was hard to argue with.\n\nThat didn’t stop the ranger from trying though, as he began to lose his temper and shout “He was bound and unarmed. You slaughtered him in cold blood. Don’t for one second try to fool me into thinking it was for an altruistic reason such as looking out for this party. You did it simply to satiate the bloodlust you have been overtaken with since your fall and your change!”\n\n“Rangers” I thought to myself “Always so smug and self righteous.” Still……’fall and change’? That got my attention..\n\n“Xavier, what does your associate mean ‘fall and change’?” I looked down to ask him.\n\n“Oh, she was dead and came back to life when we tried to burn her body.” was his response. The flippant way he was able to recite such tall tales with nary a sign of hesitation led me to believe that tiny Xavier had been witness to some serious shit along his journeys.\n\n“Came back to life?” I faintly muttered, half to myself. It was like a bolt of lightning had struck my heart. My chest seized and I had trouble catching my breath.\n\n“There they are!” said an unknown voice that snapped my wandering mind back to the current situation.\n\nI looked up from Xavier to see the fourth minion in the doorway that led to the outside, bloodied, with shards of glass still stuck into his flesh (that explains the broken window) and two green tinted Ambush Drakes slinking past him and into the kitchen.\n\nWhile the massive, snarling beasts created an intimidating sight, the numbers were clearly on our side. That also seemed to be Christoph’s mentality as he leapt forward with a savage rush and a rasping growl. His movements were deliberate and precise and in only a few deft and brutal movements the minion had his head cleaved clean from his neck, and one of the Ambush Drakes was viciously run through.\n\nThe other Ambush Drake had an open line of attack at Christoph’s back and lunged toward him. It would have inflicted a great deal of damage if it had connected, though, luckily for Christoph, an impeccable shot from my bow sent the animal reeling with an arrow to the neck. It took a few pained steps from where it landed and then fell dead, blood gushing from its’ wound.\n\nI turned my attention back to the developing conflict between the ranger and the creepy child only to see that the two remaining minions were missing and the ranger had moved into position in front of a set of double doors, that I believed led to a supply pantry. His weapons were drawn and it was obvious that he had moved the bound minions to the safety of the pantry and had taken up a defensive stance in front of it.\n\nThe girl child seemed mildly amused by this action and, with a sardonic smirk, she vanished into thin air.I stood aghast at the event, as did the other members of the party. At least, I imagine that is what happened to Christoph, since he had been completely blindsided by a devastating attack. The body of the stout fighter came flying into my line of sight and hit the far wall of the kitchen with a loud thud!\n\nBefore I could even blink another Ambush Drake passed into my peripherals and galloped toward Christoph’s prone body. Yet, once again, I was able to get a solid shot off with Xavier’s bow. The arrow whistled through the air and into the skull of the monster. It’s lifeless body tumbled head first over itself and skidded to a halt a few feet away from Christoph.\n\nI turned to the door and saw that three more of the growling creatures were slowly moving their way into the kitchen, their claws making loud clicking noises against the hard grain of the wood floor. Then, lumbering behind them, a massive four armed troll, thick with rippling muscles, sharpened tusks, and a grey toned, sickly looking flesh, came into the kitchen, having to crouch slightly just to get through the door.\n\nFrom behind me I heard Xavier humming loudly, eerily chanting words I didn’t understand, and then before my eyes I saw Christoph stand and shake off his unconsciousness as if he was simply awaking from a brief nap. It didn’t take me long to decide that there was a correlation between these two happenings. Christoph sheathed his longsword and reached to his sides and pulled out the two battle axes slung to his hips. The loud cracking of his knuckles could be heard as he squeezed the hilts of his dual wielded weapons.\n\nThe three Ambush Drakes circled closer to him and the brute of a man just smiled. I waited anxiously with another arrow drawn, looking for an opening, but, before I could rear back for a shot, I was distracted by a blinding white light coming from the direction of the pantry, which was immediately followed by the release of another fog bomb that encompassed that entire half of the kitchen, along with Christoph and the Ambush Drakes.\n\nI don’t know exactly what happened next, but the sounds emanating from the fog were ferocious, and once the veil had been lifted I saw the half elf ranger crawling toward the stairs that led to one of the upper floors, clutching his eyes as if he was struggling to see, and Christoph standing over the bodies of three fallen and bloody Ambush Drakes.\n\nAll of this was capped by the thundering sounds of plodding footsteps. I thought for sure these were the steps of the four armed troll, but the towering beast hadn’t moved, his eyes fixated completely on Christoph.\n\nNo, the ominous steps were coming from the pantry and what was walking out of it.\n\n“Is that a fucking bear?” I asked, astonished, watching a large brown bear slowly stomp out of the pantry carrying the two remaining minions under it’s arms, clutched close to its chest as if it were protecting them. It grumbled slightly as it went to the furthest corner and sat down on it’s hind legs and drew the minions in closer to it.The animal shot a disturbed look toward the pantry as the eerie little girl came casually strolling out of it.\n\nI...I don’t think I have ever seen an annoyed bear before.\nThis collective of oddities has proven most entertaining in the brief period of time I have known them, and judging from the boisterous battle cry that Christoph just unleashed, the show wasn’t over yet.\n\nI have traveled lands far and wide, and have never shied from observing a good fight. From regal tournaments to raucous pub brawls, I have seen them all, but never have I seen one with such blistering savagery as what I witnessed between the fighter and the four armed troll.\n\nChristoph’s dual wielded attacks with the two smaller weapons seemed to be just as powerful as his assaults with his longsword, and the way he spun and sliced, the dancer like grace in which he moved, was rather impressive for someone of his size. Every time the troll would mount an offense, landing clubbing blows against Christoph’s head and chest that would have fell a lesser man, the brawler just battled back by removing the limb that just struck him until the once mighty troll was on his knees, a visceral mess, all four of his strong muscled arms lying severed on the floor beside him.\n\nChristoph dealt the final blow by bringing down both axes on either side of the troll’s neck, cutting deeply into the monstrosity’s bulging deltoid muscles until his head and neck just sort of slipped off the edges of Christoph’s blades and landed on the floor in a profusely bloody plop.\nA Startling Revelation\nThe hallway door swung open violently and Cragdor brandished a vicious looking dagger in his hand.\n\n“Have at thee, wretched minions!!” his tone so serious and his expression so stern that I almost felt bad for him once he realized the fighting was over and his assistance wasn’t needed. As his face drooped and his shoulders slumped, he walked over to me and gently laid my equipment at my feet.\n\nEveryone laughed, and it proved to be just the thing that was needed to alleviate some of the tension that hung over the room. It was a welcome respite that we all seemed to appreciate, and I took the opportunity to change my garb and secure my leathers and gear. After so long without them, it felt good to wear them once again.\n\nWith a comforting pat on the shoulder Xavier left Maracella’s side to check on Christoph, who, at this point, had slumped to one knee, exhausted from battle. Joining them from across the room was the bear, who, as he walked, transmorphed back into the druid’s human form. The druid had left the two remaining minions bound and trembling in the corner, too petrified of any alternatives facing them to even attempt to move. The tall bearded fellow stood stoically by himself, appearing to be nothing more than observer at this juncture in time.\n\nThe ranger was propped against some steps leading to the upstairs, still shaking off the effects that blinding light seemed to have on his vision. As the eerie girl walked toward him he held up his hand in a defensive motion. “Not one step further, Shizune.”\n\n“Harsh words, especially considering your unprovoked attack on me in the pantry, Veldross.” replied the girl, her voice chilling, but non-combative.\n\n“Unprovoked!?” said Veldross, the half elf ranger, aghast. “You dare speak to me of provocation after what you….you know what!? Those two men are MY captives, placed under my protection. Any more acts of violence upon them should be considered an act of violence upon me, an act that will result in a reckoning between you and I child, mark my words.”\n\nWith that, the ranger stood, shaking off any lingering effects the light had on him and walked toward his captives. As he walked past her, the girl, Shizune, held up her hands and backed away in a sign of docile submission, but the devilish grin on her face told me the act wasn’t done out of fear, just a biding of time.\n\nAs Veldross shoved the bound minions into the pantry and barred the door, Christoph stood, seemingly rejuvenated, no doubt by the words and spells of the druid and the tiefling, and commanded everyone’s attention.\n\n“Tallis is here.” was all he said, in a plain voice, but the facial expressions of his companions told me the words themselves held more weight than the tone in which they were spoke. He lifted his arm and pointed in my direction “And he can show us where.”\n\nI never did care for being the center of attention, stifling as it is to someone in my line of work, choosing instead to blend in and remain inconspicuous, but the brawler’s words had rendered my feelings on the subject moot, as every eye in the room was now upon me.\n\nWell, I had bluffed my way to this point, time to crawl my way through it and hope to remain in tact.“Upstairs. There was an ornate, important looking room. It’s where I was taken captive. I believe we should start the search there.”\nChristoph fastened his two axes back to his hips, unsheathed his longsword, and started marching for the stairs.\n\n“Wait.” exclaimed the druid. “We can’t care for these poor souls and deal with Tallis. Let us secure them and go as one.” But his words fell on deaf ears, as Christoph stomped up the stairs.\n\n“Dammit, there he goes.” said Veldross. Motioning to the dwarf with the cooking gear ( who, this whole time appeared to be minding his own business and admiring the kitchen and it’s utensils) Veldross, the half elf, spoke in a haughty, ordering tone “Tharm. Take the girl, the gnome and this other dwarf, find a room to hold up in and await our return.”\n\nThe dwarf, Tharm, just nodded and smiled, seeming to just genuinely be happy to be there, and Cragdor silently consented to the ranger’s instruction. Maracella seemed hesitant, but with a smile from Xavier and a comforting, gentle shoo of his hand, she followed the cook as well, as they left the room through the hallway door..\n\nI, on the other hand, stood my ground.\n\n“I am not going anywhere on your orders. I am here of my own accord and take instruction from no one. Your companions freed me from my bondage and have my thanks and trust. Not you. Who the fuck are you?”\n\nThe ranger didn’t seem to appreciate my icy tone, nor the calculated manner of my words. He began to inch toward me, until Xavier stood between the two of us.\n\n“Veldross. This is David, a captive here. He’s a thief and has proven himself a sworn enemy of the cult. While you and Shizune were bickering, he helped Christoph keep the enemy from overrunning us.” said the tiefling.\n\nThe ranger looked down on me, with an obvious look of disgust at the revelation of my trade, but seemed contented by the bard’s words.\n\nThis was my first opportunity to be this close to the half elf, and it was at this moment I noticed the shining golden brooch pinned to his tunic. It formed a crescent moon and a gilded harp. Well, that explains it. He’s a Harper. They try their best to be a secret organization, preferring to operate in the shadows, overthrowing governments, and unseating tyrants. They are a force for good, or so their mantra claims, seeking no glory or riches for their actions, instead choosing to remain unknown to the realm at large for the betterment of blah, blah, blah, and so on and so forth. But they aren’t the only ones who operate in the shadows, are they? I’ve heard of them plenty, even had a run in with a few on occasion. They choose very rarely to lower themselves to the not so righteous cause of stopping thieves, even those as exceptional as myself, but their disdain is no less apparent.\n\n(end part one)",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, so here's the deal, I am new to D&amp;D and new to Reddit. Some of the guys in the campaign I am now a part of knew I liked games with in depth stories and that I really enjoy writing and drawing.\n\nSo, they suggested I pick up D&amp;D, and one of them, the DM, even found a way to work my character into his 'Hoard of the Dragon Queen' 5e campaign.\n\nI was instantly hooked.\n\nI decided to start chronicling the sessions out, from the first person perspective of my character, a Gnome Rogue Thief with a Criminal background, and this is the story of the first session.\n\nDISCLAIMER As I mentioned, I am new to D&amp;D, so I didn't know alot of the lore or characters. So, if, as you are reading this, you notice that some of the characters names are spelled incorrectly, or that I turned a dragonborn into a human, please forgive the faux pas.\n\nDISCLAIMER #2 This group consists of mainly chaotic neutral/evil characters, and earlier this year after \"The Great Alignment Debate of 2016\" between two of our players, the DM decided to drop alignment all together. So be prepared for some fuckery. Oh, yeah, as things get heated there will also be alot of cursing. So, turn ye back now if offended by a multitude of 'fucks'.\n\nThis is a part of my character's backstory that was created with the help of the DM on introducing my character to the campaign. Enjoy!\n\n\nThis Is The Beginning\n\n“It’s been twenty years today, Elly. Twenty years without you. Twenty years of being haunted by my failures. I miss you. So much. Not a day goes by where I don’t think of you. Your smile. Your light. The joy you brought to my life. I would do anything to have you back.”\n\nThose were the words I spoke the last time I visited my wife’s grave. A small, nondescript mound, under a gigantic oak tree, on a hill where the sun hits most hours of the day. There is no marker or stone, but I know exactly how to get to it. This is where she died, after all. A night of bad decisions that torments me still, mocking my memory of her. I try not to think about them, but the horrific images flash before my eyes regardless. The torrential rainfall. The darkness. The soldiers. The spear that slew my beloved. The warchief who fell under my blade.\n\nDamn it all.\n\nWhy am I haunted so? I am a hundred and fifty years old. We had over a century together. Multiple lifetimes worth of love and happiness. I even killed the one responsible for her death. So, why is it when I close my eyes all I feel is pain? Why is all I have left bad memories? Why can I not let her go?\n\nI place the bouquet of orchids, her favorite, down beside her resting place and say my goodbyes. “I have to go now, Ellyjoe. I have a meeting in Waterdeep. Sounds profitable if Bronson is to be believed. Though, you never know with crazy old bastard.” A few days later, sitting in The Corellian Star Cantina on the East End of Waterdeep, drowning my sorrows with a pint of ale, I heard the man’s proposal. Heard it. Yet couldn’t believe it. \n\n“A Helmed Horror?” I said, somewhat aghast “Have you gone completely mad?”\n\nBronson Halfhart, the old, grizzled, and world weary wizard looked at me with mock indignation. I like Bronson. I would even, on rare occasion, be tempted to call him a friend. His presence has spared me my life on more than one instance, and the information he provides me on magical goods are one of my most valued resources.\n\nIn most cases I wouldn’t hesitate to hear his proposal for a potential job, but what he was putting before me now was tantamount to suicide.\n\n“So, that’s a no, then?” was the only retort he was able to muster.\n\n“Yes, you insane old bastard, that’s a no.”\n\n“Look” he said “I have the spell needed to transfer power over the beast, and once you gain control no force could oppose you!”\n\n“Brilliant, sounds like you have all you need. Do it yourself.” I told him, as I washed down the bitter taste of the conversation with what little ale remained in my pint. “I wash my hands of it.”\n\n“I can’t do it myself. I’m too damn old, and I am no thief. You are...or at least you used to be.”\n\n“Really, Bronson? Attempting to challenge my pride? That’s beneath you.”\n\n“You aggravating little gnome asshole.” the wizard seethed “How many items have I brought you in the past? How much money have I made you? Believe me when I say this is a job worth undertaking. The hunting lodge is in the middle of nowhere, a vast mountain range 20 miles south of Parnast. Most of the time it’s completely vacant aside from some guard patrols. Someone with your skill could slip in easily.”\n\n“Said the wizard with no apparent skills whatsoever, it would seem.” My words bit harder than I meant them too, but I brushed off the early onset of guilt and motioned the bar maid for another pint. “Bronson, look, yes, I am grateful for all the leads you’ve given me in the past, you know that. But I am way out of practice. I’m a fence. I’ll sell the shit, I haven’t been out in the field or worked a job myself in years. Why don’t you ask Namir to do it?”\n\nThe wizard shuddered. “Namir..Namir scares me. Besides, why ask the student when I can ask the teacher, hmm?” I chuckled slightly and shook my head. It didn’t appear he was going to take ‘no’ for an answer, but it was the only answer he was going to find from me.\n\nStill sensing my hesitation, Bronson slammed his fist on the table in frustration.“Fine! You want the truth? That bloody cult knows my face. I can’t get within a mile of Parnast without risk of exposure.”\n\n“Cult?” Damn...he had managed to pique my interest.\n\n“The Cult of the Dragon. I’m sure you’ve heard of them. They’ve amassed quite a reputation for themselves. Moving across the realm, growing their numbers, swelling their influence. Twenty years ago they were merely remnants of their former selves, now though? They are the ones who stole the Helmed Horror from me. I dread what they could possibly have planned for it, despicable slavers.” He added that last part with a slight smile on his lips.\n\nDamn it again, the wily old codger knew he had my attention now. I keep my feelings and emotions close to my chest, but I have never shied away from voicing my disgust and vitriol when it came to slavery. I refused to do business or trade with anyone who partook in the wretched act, and Bronson knew it.\n\n“Tell me about the dragon.” I asked. Hook. Line. Sinker.\n\nHe began to describe the cult and the one they worship in vivid detail and what he pictured was enough to send my mind reeling to the same dark place it visits every time I close my eyes.\nEvery time I see a flaxen haired beauty in a crowd.\nEvery time my broken heart continued to beat despite no longer having reason to.\n\nThis was no trick. Despite knowing my disdain for slavers, Bronson had no knowledge of what had happened with the soldiers that night, nor the devastating loss of my beloved Ellyjoe, having become an acquaintance years afterward. Yet here he was, describing the crimson color of their robes, the style of their weapons, and that horrible smiling visage of the demonic dragon on the war chief’s armor. \n\nTwenty years, the wizard had said….\n\nI had always assumed them for just another roving band of soldiers, perhaps belonging to some random outpost. My interest was in their valuables, not them. Now though…..had I missed the signs in front of me all along? I had to know.\n\n“I have business in Parnast.” I lied. “The job will cost you 500 gold pieces down for travel expenses, and 20,000 gold pieces on delivery.”\n\n“That’s outrageous!” The old wizard flummoxed. I knew the old man was good for it, but I let him continue his drama regardless. “I won’t pay it!”\n\n“Then get some daft ranger, looking for a quest to brag about to all the bar maids he aims to fuck. You want me to do it, those are my terms.” I said cooly.\n\nThe look he shot me almost passed for legitimate anger, yet he still reached into the hidden pocket inside the sleeve of his robe (he had long since given up trying to conceal it from my keen eyes) and tossed a small satchel of gold on the table.\n\n“Give me all the information I need, Bronson, and you had better hope that spell works.”\n\nOne week later I was passing the outskirts of Parnast on my way to the lodge. Not a moment too soon either. Parnast always stank too much of pig shit and human piss for my liking.\nI made the lodge by nightfall, and, as always, Bronson’s information seemed on point.\nA stately hunting lodge near the peak of one of the northern most mountains. An odd assortment of massive stone pillars dotted the perimeter. Stables in the back and a command post (more than likely where the bulk of the guards were keeping warm) on the western edge of the property.Yet near the manor itself there appeared to be no sign of force with the exception of a circling patrol of trolls...no...wait...hmmm. Ambush Drakes hiding in the darkness of the trees.\nGood thing I can see in the dark.\n\nI snuck past them all with no resistance and lock picked my way into the estate’s front door. There was some mild bickering at the end of the main corridor coming just over the clattering and clanging of pots and pans. I assumed it was members of the staff in the kitchen (should be no more than four of them according to the intel I had gathered) so I paid the ruckus no mind and slipped into the first room on the left.\n\nThere it was. The Helmed Horror.\n\nDamn.\nFor the briefest of moments I began to feel in over my head, as the massive structure, over 7 feet tall by my estimates, literally stood over my head. To unknowing eyes it was just a simple suit of armor (nothing good ever comes out of my involvement with suits of armor, I swear). A terrifying and deformed suit of armor, black as ink with sharpened and intimidating horns jutting to and fro, but yes, armor nonetheless.\n\nUntil the first fool comes along and touches the dastardly thing unleashing the demonic magical force pent up inside, that is. Once a Helmed Horror is betrothed to a master, no other living soul dare come near it.\n\nI reached into the pouch on my leathers and began to unscroll the parchment that Bronson had written the incantation on that would allow me to take possession of the beast.\nI cleared my throat and began to utter the words when I heard it.\nA voice. Not my own of course, but calling my name all the same. “Rebel.” That’s what she called me. Never David. Not even when she was angry. It was always “Rebel.”\nLight as a whisper, but intoxicating to the sound.\n\nGods, could it be?\n\nWas it really my Elljoe?\n\nThe enchanting voice of my dearly departed wife beckoned me upstairs, and like the simple schoolboy back in Miller’s Hollow, I followed. As always, I followed.\n\nI entered the room where I would stake my life that the voice was coming from, and while I did not see the comely smile etched on the beautiful face I longed for, I saw a smile of another sort.\nThe snarling, evil smile of the dragon. That gruesome face was etched into four wood pillars supporting the vaulted roofs of the stately room. Tapestries adorned the stone walls, picturing epic scale destruction with dragons at the epicenter of the encroaching doom. I recognized the towns pictured, having visited them many times before. I felt the warmth beating my face when I turned to see a raging fireplace crackling with flame.\n\nThis wasn’t right.\n\nNo one but servants are supposed to be here.\n\n“Oh no” where the last words I managed to utter before being savagely knocked into unconsciousness.\n\nI awoke chained to a wall in a dank, foul smelling basement. I had been stripped of my leathers, my tools and my weapons, and gotten only a throbbing headache in return.\n\n“Never again.” I thought to myself. “No more suits of fucking armor.”\n\nI wasn’t alone in my new confines, as I looked to my left and noticed a fetching young beauty, for a human anyway, chained up beside me.\nThe first few days were pretty uneventful aside from the routine beatings. I don’t even seem to recall them asking me any questions. The lowly minions in the red robes, who I could only assume were the same servants I heard bickering in the kitchen days earlier, just took turns with the lash, the pliers and the blade.\n\nThe girl next to me, Maracella, as I would learn her name was in the many hours we spent caged alone, received no such treatment. Though every night she was removed from her shackles and not returned until morning with fresh bruises and fresh tears. It didn’t take me long to deduct what particular form of torture our tormentors thrust upon her, though we never spoke of it. It was also the main reason that despite learning of her home, her family, and her dreams, I never asked her age. The thought of it alone made me wretch, the poor child.\n\nWe had both seemed to resign ourselves to the sickening routine when the minions decided to add another layer of fresh hell to our existence by starving us. Oh, they would bring the food down on a daily basis, for sure, and then leave it on a stack of sundries just outside the reach of our chains. The two of us would struggle to reach the plates, kicking and screaming, tearing the skin around our wrists as the manacles dug deeper into flesh, all while the minions laughed, to no avail.\nDays passed as we watched the food pile up, the flies and maggots gather, and the rot sink in.\nThis went on for no telling how long as the days, the beatings, and the rumblings of our empty stomachs blurred into a frustrating but inescapable monotony.\n\nUntil they brought in the dwarf.\n\nHe apparently didn’t get the benefit of being rendered unconscious before they drug him down to the basement dungeon, kicking and screaming in that guttural brogue most common in northern dwarves, as they chained him up on the far side of Maracella.\n\nHe to, like the girl by my side, would receive special treatment, though his was in the form of flame, as the minions rejoiced in singeing the hair on his head and beard, and burning his flesh. They also bombarded him with questions.\n\nIn the hours and days that would pass, I would be awoken an untold number of times to the screams. In my hunger filled haze I was able to discern names like Tallis, Tiamat, and found out that the dwarf’s name was Cragdor, and that the minions believed him to be an agent of Rezmir.\n\nDespite my varied travels, and perhaps in lieu of my weakened state brought on by hunger and the beatings (which, despite the dwarf’s presence, hadn’t subsided) none of these names held meaning to me.\n\nNothing held meaning to me. I could feel all semblance of life, void as it already was of meaning, draining from me. I would sleep longer and longer in between the beatings. My end was drawing near. There was no doubt. Truth be told, I almost welcomed it.\n\nThere were brief moments, in my delirium, that I swore I even saw the face of my darling Ellyjoe. Then, at what I thought to be the end, knowing all remnants of strength I had were gone, I heard the voice again. That same angelic whisper that beckoned me up the stairs all those...days? Weeks? Months ago? I had no idea. But I knew that voice. Ellyjoe. My light. My life. Calling my name.\n\nI thought in any instant she would beckon me home, back to her arms. Yet those words never came. Instead the only words that those lovely dulcet tones whispered into my ear were:\n“Hold on.”\nAnd I did. Despite the continued beatings, the excruciating pain, and the pangs of starvation, every night those two words, coming from some unseen plane, would sweetly whisper into my ear.\n“Hold on.”\n\nAfter hearing those two words again and again, day after day, I began to anticipate them. To yearn, every night, for that whisper in my ear, until one night……..the words never came. As morning dawned, I thought quietly to myself “Alright Rebel. That’s it. You’ve finally gone mad.”\nUntil I heard the shouts and clamoring of battle raging upstairs. As the noises from above began to become audibly louder, Cragdor and Maracella were awakened, and, recognizing the sounds for what they were, began to scream with beckoning cries of help.\n\nBut not me. Instead, I just smiled to myself and whispered. “I held on, beloved. Just like you asked.”",

        "text": "[*In a world of fantasy bullshit, exploding dams, and murderous globs of acidic jello...*](https://redd.it/4hr41e)\n\nFour adventurers were coming off an adrenaline high to end all adrenaline highs. They had just saved the goddamn world! Sort of. Well, I mean, it wasn't like the world was going to explode or anything, but they'd saved a lot of people. Probably. Maybe not, like, all of the people, but the point was, they'd done right by the people they liked while dicking over the people they didn't like. And the triple digit body count was all well and good as long as it was in the name of justice, right? Well, sort of justice. Okay, so basically the prison break they had just pulled off had less in common with world-saving and more with terrorism, but that's just semantics.\n\nOur four \"Freedom Fighters\" are such: [Nibbit the murderous dullahan](http://i.imgur.com/EyuHkT8.png) (who by this point is a twitching mess of disassembled body parts and not influencing the plot at all), [Loki the half-elf rogue that specializes in lying](http://i.imgur.com/LFK6CyZ.png), [Jello Shot the slime magus who specifically took weapon proficiency: Seige Cannon](http://i.imgur.com/oNuhhTF.gif), and [Ling Ling, the monkey girl and the only one with a functioning brain](http://i.imgur.com/2SwMf0l.png).\n\nNow that they had pulled off their clever jailbreak on those pesky humans (who are ASSHOLES, by the way), they were now at a loss for what to do. I mean, they'd just saved the world (more or less... actually, definitely less), but now what?\n\nWell, number one on the list of things NOT to do was get involved in a big old screaming match between several varieties of pompous asshole, stuffed shirt, and sarcastic dipshit. Apparently someone was calling a big old meeting in the Sanctuary about what the hell to do now that the humans had been taken down a notch by the party. Nobody really felt like listening in, except maybe Ling Ling.\n\nWhile dicking around and trying not to get involved with things, the party ran into a few weird things. The first weird thing was a strange, inconsolably crying man in a bunny mask. After Ling Ling established that No, eating his shoes was NOT going help, thank you Jello Shot, and No, stealing his wallet would NOT going to fix anything, thank you Loki, and could we please all stop trying to give this poor man a concussion and steal his stuff for chrissakes we're supposed to be the good guys, they finally found the correct course of action: Loudly screaming the Konami Code and giving the poor man a hug. Well, technically, the Code hadn't helped all that much, but Loki was rewarded with a 15% discount at some obscure game shop, courtesy of the sad Bunny Man. The hug was much more effective, and Bunny Man (still holding back sobs) thanked the party for their understanding and also not mugging him, because that would be rude. He then galloped off into the sunset, astride a freakish eight-legged centaur. Well, okay then.\n\nNext up was a young orc, named Krag, who was having a heated argument with his father over who should lead the orc tribe. Krag very much did NOT want the position of warchief, and his father (the current warchief) didn't really want it either. But the only alternative was Krag's older sister, who was flighty, incredibly magically gifted, and just about the least orcy orc that had ever orc'd. Krag was given an ultimatum: Convince his sister to take up Warchiefing, or get thrust headlong into the job himself.\n\nThe party watched with high amusement as Krag tried, and rather spectacularly failed, to convince his [Dear Sister Spinebreaker](http://pre07.deviantart.net/8fcd/th/pre/f/2016/137/b/8/c__spinebreaker_by_kiyan200-da2sfmb.png) that she should be playing babysitter to a bunch of psychotic man-children. Ling Ling could only cringe in sympathy.\n\nAt about the same time, Loki ran into an old pal from back home- an elvish childhood friend on his way in to the big meeting. According to him, the Big Old Meeting was going to be one HELL of an event, especially when he busted out some sort of mysterious surprise! But all was not well, as it was apparently SUCH a surprise that, for political reasons, some other elves might try to forcibly stop them from springing it. Loki reluctantly agreed to get involved in politics, if only to help out an old friend.\n\nAbout five minutes later, the party was walking along, chatting with Krag, when they encountered their first elvish hit squad, approaching them in a FIERCELY NEUTRAL AND NONVIOLENT area, and were very definitely not holding weapons behind their backs and backing the party into a waiting assassin. Which was when, naturally, the waiting assassin crit failed a stealth roll, tripped over a rock, and dropped about a dozen HIGHLY RESTRICTED POISONOUS WEAPONS onto the ground.\n\nNobody was particularly pleased with this development.\n\nFive minutes later, when the party had beaten the everloving fuck out of the would-be assassins, disarmed them, and angrily extracted an explanation for why the hit squad was there, which equated to \"blah blah blah politics blah blah elves are dicks\". The party, plus Krag, resolved to not let this shit stand and also to slap the shit of any elves they came across who had ideas about political assassination. They turned over the unconscious hit-men to the resident authority figure, [Orthur the omnipotent cleric-dork](http://i.imgur.com/2eje8It.png), and went on a merry spree of violence before the fateful meeting began.\n\nThe big surprise, it turned out, was that the Elves on the planet belonged to two distinct factions: One, native elves, who had lived there all their lives and were rather chill, if cagey, fellows. Faction two was \"Faery\" elves, who came from another dimension, thought they were superior to everyone, and were collossal fuckbags. And to prove the point, they had a witness who could basically fuck up everything that the Fae elves had ever said: A human who had lived in Elvhish society and had seen the invasion of the Fae elves and witnessed their rampant douchebaggery. He was so deeply into it, in fact, that he'd been in hiding for the past, oh, eighteen years. To the surprise of absolutely nobody, this character witness turned out to be Loki's estranged dad.\n\nThere was a lot of commotion, screaming, a few attempted murders, some punches, a lot of unkind words, Jello Shot ate a few people's shoes, and the issue was officially resolved: Faery elves were declared to be pompous dicks, assassins, and excessively snobby, and therefore weren't allowed to talk to the big boys anymore. Whereupon the dickish elvish representative threw a tantrum, had to be restrained by Krag, and as a last-ditch effort, tried to kill Krag with a Curse.\n\nNow, Curses are a BIG DEAL, which is why they have a capital C. A Curse can, and usually DOES, kill the person it lands on. It was also unremovable, and ludicrously powerful to boot. The party was officially up Shit Creek, and even Jello Shot's magical expertise couldn't guarantee the young orc's safety. Which was when the rather quiet magical golem, standing in the corner and presumed to be part of the furniture up until now, spoke up and offered Krag assistance in exchange for a favor. Not having a great abundance of options, Krag agreed, and the golem suplexed the Curse out of the air and crushed it in its massive metal hand. Crisis averted! So the party promptly descended upon the dickish elf who had tried to cast the curse, beat the everloving shit out of him, and threw him out the nearest window. And then ate his shoes.\n\nAt this point, the strange golem loudly split in half down the middle, spraying sparks and chunks of metal. The left half then proceeded to rise into the air and declare itself God.\n\nTurns out the golem was little more than a host for a colony of sentient magical creatures, calling themselves the Mana. Up until now, the Mana had survived by inhabiting the minds of spellcasters and leeching their magical power in exchange for arcane wisdom, but these Mana had found some alternate source of magic energy that didn't require anyone at all. Appropriately, they called this power Source. And seeing as they had Source at their disposal, they had no need to serve or fear the \"pathetic little meatlings\", and they were to be treated with the respect due to someone who could instantly vaporize you with a thought and and a glance. Nobody was particularly impressed by this display, so with a pretentious huff, the left half of the golem proclaimed itself Thaumadeus (literally God of Magic) and blasted a hole in the ceiling for a dramatic exit.\n\nThe RIGHT half of the golem haltingly explained that most of this was, in fact, the truth. The Mana HAD obtained a source of unimaginable power, and they DID call it Source, and oh yeah, half of the people at the table had it, as well. But the right half of the golem didn't see a particular reason to declare itself God and lord it over their fellow sentient creatures, which immediately scored brownie points from everyone else. And with that, everyone decided they'd had enough world-shaking revelations for one day, and proclaimed that it was time to break for lunch. Nobody argued.\n\nDuring this lunch, Krag's father proudly declared that Krag had gotten into a fine old mess, having made an enemy of an entire political faction, having a life-debt to another, and nothing especially to show for it. Apparently he was doing great at learning proper Warchiefing, as most of it was just bumbling along being Orcy until things worked out. Thus, Krag was officially assigned to the party to \"See da world\" and \"Knock sum 'eads\" until he'd gained enough experience to be a proper Warchief. Krag did not argue the point, and joined up with the party to replace the busted-down Nibbit.\n\nHopefully, they would have a nice, easy, low-stress mission to start themselves off and get used to their new friends.",

        "text": "- This is a dramatization of the first time I won a science victory against actual human players in civ 5.  Do note that I took a bit of creative liberty for the sake of story. Comments and criticism is welcomed! \n\n---\n\nI was the first and the last pharaoh of Egypt.  My reign began in a fertile plain at the dawn of civilization. On a hill between a mountain range (which I named after myself) and a great river I founded the capital of what was to be the greatest civilization on Earth.  Lovingly, I christened this city Thebes.\n\nAs time went on my city grew large and prosperous.  My people ventured from the safety of Thebes into the wild unknown.  My scouting parties found new lands for my people to settle, my warriors exterminated the uncivilized barbarians that plagued the countryside, and my empire rapidly spread across the small continent we called home. Eventually, the sea haled our expansion by land, but being an industrious people we quickly set out across the oceans to discover new lands.  Through these stalwart explorers I met those who had also shaken off the shackles of barbarism and developed civilizations of their own.\n\nFirst, I met Elizabeth.  Her empire was the largest save for mine.  It spanned across oceans, drawing on cities all over the world.  She had built a powerful navy to protect what was hers, but she did not threaten my sovereignty of the lands that rightfully belonged to my people.  She was a reasonable, if distrusting, leader but her people could not resist my the gold, silver, and gems that flowed from my borders.\n\nI then met Bismark.  I was informed by his neighbors that his empire was the powerhouse on the continent they shared.   His army was second to none and he used its might to manipulate the others who surrounded him.  To me however he was an ally and a valuable trading partner.  The ocean between us meant we had no reason to contest for land, but our scientists moved freely between accelerating both of our understandings of the world around us.\n\nNext was Wu Zetian.  Living under the omnipresent threat of Bismark she was only able to forge a small empire with a rich and flourishing culture.  Our separation left us with few reasons to interact, but when we did so she was more than reasonable. \n\nFinally, there was Washington.  His empire was by far the smallest in the world, but his people were happy and well fed.  Of all the leaders of the world, he was by far the most amicable.  Washington was an honorable man and we became good friends and allies throughout the years. \n\nFor nearly six millennia I reigned over my halcyon empire.   A network of colonies brought in a wealth of resources upon which I built an empire to serve as a resplendent beacon for all mankind.  The most brilliant architects in the world created structures of wonder, merchants and traders brought luxuries unimaginable, and we generated cultural touchstones that were envied across the globe.  My people were happy, healthy, and well fed, but above all else, my people were the best educated in the world. Scientists and inventors regularly pushed the boundaries of what we as humans thought possible.  Eventually, I decided it was time to show the world what we could accomplish.\n\nWith the help of the greatest minds in my  empire, I began a construction project rivaled by nothing that had come before.  In the coming years, we were going to build a great vessel to take my empire to the starts themselves! As a young pharaoh thousands of years ago I could have only dreamed of the day I would commission such an undertaking.  The grand city of Memphis was where the first piece of this vessel was to be constructed.  In my excited fervor I had this inaugural piece brought to the capital in a grand display.  It was in my hubris that I announced to the world that I had begun this glorious project, and it was this hubris that doomed my people.\n\n---\n\nNot a day later a subordinate rushed into my office with a message.  My face went pale, my stomach sank, and the paper fell to the floor.  It was a message from my closest ally Washington.  The unthinkable had happened; Elizabeth, Bismark, and Wu had set aside their differences and together planned to destroy everything I had built before we could finish the crowning achievement of our civilization.\n\nA deathly silence filled the room as the weight of this news sank upon me.  After a moment I composed myself.  This news may be the most dire I have ever received, but it may also mean salvation for my people. Now we could prepare.  I order the subordinate to extend my deepest gratitude to Washington and to ask for whatever support he can offer.  Unfortunately, I knew he could not support me directly lest he suffer the same fate.  It was only fitting that the greatest empire would stand alone.\n\nNext, I sent out an order to the three cities at my empire's core, the foundation upon which it was built.  Thebes, the thriving heart of my empire, Memphis, the manufacturing hub, and Heliopolis, the global center for learning and scientific advancement.  Each would dedicate all efforts to finishing my great vessel for it may be our only hope.  \u000b\u000bI then ordered a cease on all manufacturing for civilian and commercial goods.  Everything must go to preparing us for the coming war.  I threw open the treasury and paid for defenses to protect my people and barracks to train the new troops.  We would not go down quietly.  \n\nFinally, I recalled all defensive forces from the colonies, with any luck they would be spared. \n\n---\n\nAs the sixth millennium was ushered in I received word from my vanguard reporting legions of ships approaching both the eastern and western borders. British, Chinese, and Germans sailing together, no doubt with the singular goal of our extinction.  I had sent envoys to the other leaders to plead for the fate of my people but not one returned.  Each dead messenger was a harbinger of the approaching doom.  With that I gave the order.  My newly developed submarines fired the most deadly of weapons for the first time.  Thanks to my good friend I had the uranium I needed to fire two, and only two.  This victory was short lived however as their ships pushed ever forth, a neigh unstoppable wave of encroaching destruction.  Valiantly, my navy stood against the horde, fighting tooth and nail for every nautical mile, but eventually their troops landed upon my shores.  \n\nWhat they found was a populace prepared to fight for every inch of soil.  Farms, mines, and woodlands were ripped up and fortifications built upon them.  Each city was shored up and armed to the teeth, prepared to fight the invaders tooth and nail, building by building.  For years, they sieged my coastal cities.  What naval forces I could muster fought a losing battle, and my air forces were matched at every juncture.  One by one, my outer cities fell, millions slaughtered as the war machine marched inland. They paid for every inch of land they took; my forces fought with a ferocity and dedication unmatched by any in history.\n\nFire rained down upon the metropolis of Alexandria.  Home to nearly ten million people, its population rivaled that of Thebes itself.  The flood plains that had once fed this great city were now fortresses and foxholes.  For years the people held out, millions conscripted to fight off the attackers, but eventually they succumbed to the rockets, the bombs, and the troops storming the city. Millions died as my troops were forced to fall back from the city.  They dug in their heels as they were pushed ever closer to Thebes. The only good news to come with this was that the three boosters for my ship were finally complete.  My people may still be saved.  \n\nIt was then that a horrid realization dawned on me.  In the defense of Alexandria, I had sent bombers stationed in my capital to destroy attacking forces.  This meant that soon, the airfield in Alexandria would allow the enemy to bomb my capital… or worse.  With a heavy heart I asked my Washington for more resources and he obliged.  With his uranium, I prepared to do the unthinkable, the unforgivable.  The once prosperous city of Alexandria, still home to millions of my own people, was to be wiped from the map.  War leaves no man unscathed.  \n\nThe fight was not over however.  Slowly, the enemy fought their way around the great mountain range that protected Thebes and laid siege to the city of Heliopolis.  The gods shined upon us however, and the stasis chamber for my grand ship escaped as they sacked the city.  Knowing what was soon to come, I commissioned the construction of another nuclear missile in Thebes. One more unspeakable act, one last great tragedy.  It was the only way any of us would survive.  \n\n---\n\nThere I stood.  A once mighty empire now reduced to ash and cinders.  Once fertile plains covered in the bodies of soldiers and civilians alike.  Great cities reduced to nothing but smoldering rubble and pained memories. My colonies I had relinquished to my only worldly friend.  Under his rule those who were to be left behind would at least know peace.  Now, only two cities remained.  Two candles fighting to stay lit amidst the darkness.  My troops had formed a perimeter around Thebes, ready for a final stand against the invaders.  As we stood at the brink of destruction, I consulted with my advisors.\n\nMy Foreign advisor informed me that Belgrade would soon no longer be our ally.  I nodded, they had provided me with invaluable troops to fight these invaders.\n\nMy economic advisor informed me that my greatest expenditure was maintaining the military.  My heart was heavy at the solemn fact for this had not always been the case.\n\nMy military advisor again reminded me that my only friend had almost no military.  I still stood alone.\n\nFinally, my scientific advisor congratulated me on our efficient education system. I knew it had to be our salvation.\n\nAs enemy soldiers bared down upon my capital, the very pinnacle of human civilization. I received the news I had been waiting for throughout this entire war.  Memphis had completed the project.\n\nArtillery shells hailed down upon Thebes as time and again enemy soldiers rushed its great walls.  The cockpit for my grand ship was rushed into the city under military escort.  My people we ready for its arrival.  Through the faint sounds of gunfire and bombs I addressed my people for one last time.  \n\n\"The Egyptian legacy would not be forgotten.  So many brave souls sacrificed their lives to ensure that fact.  Every man and woman who has laid down their life in the face of the invaders is a hero of the Egyptian people.  But despite the destruction, the bombs, the enemy soldiers beating on our walls today marks not the end but a new beginning.  Today we leave behind the horrid world we had come to know.  A world of faction's petty bickering and contempt.  Today we venture forth into the great unknown to rebuild greater than ever before, greater than any of the small minded fools outside these walls could ever imagine!  Today, history has been made AND IT WILL NOT SOON BE FORGOTTEN!\"\n\nWith that, I relinquished the city of Memphis to Washington in hopes of sparing them the genocide.  Then, with every civilian I could fit, I boarded the ship to abandon the only home we had ever known.\n\nA rumble shakes the very earth.  For but a moment the attack falters, the gunfire ceases, the shells stop.  All eyes, friend and foe alike, turn skyward as a pillar of smoke rises into the sky.  Shining like the sun, the apotheosis of human ingenuity rises into the sky.  With its departure, a deathly silence washed across the battlefield at the very doorstep of Thebes. In that moment, the whole world learned one singular fact: The Egyptians were the greatest people to ever walk the earth, and now they were to walk the stars.\n",

        "text": "Hello again! This is a continuation of the previous story 'The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story Part 3', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4hggh0/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/. Last time, our gang of reprobates had successfully managed to infiltrate New York City. Avoiding the Zel'tan hovering ominously over the city, the team decided to set up their headquarters at the American Museum of Natural History. There, alongside the enigmatic Sarge and his team of hot-shot mercenaries, the battle begins to reclaim the Big Apple from it's new alien overlords. The stage is set, the pawns are in position and a plan of attack is nowhere close to being developed. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\nMinato panted as he struggled furiously against the smothering weight of his foe. His lithe frame trembled from the exertion as a thin sheen of sweat covered his body. Kitsune gnashed his teeth in helpless frustration as his opponent pressed him further and further towards the floor, his legs buckling beneath him. With a single, desperate gasp, the con-man dropped to the cold stone as he was crushed by the heavy tarpaulin atop him. Tiredly mumbling something from beneath the canvas, Minato reluctantly accepted his fate: Sprawled across desolate stone. The sheet of fabric was ripped away from him as Pilot sighed in disgust, stapling it across a window. Darkness descended on the hall as other soldiers emulated him. With the sun blotted out, the mercenary offered his prone ally a hand.\n\n\"Seriously? I thought you were supposed to be a super-villain.\" Pilot's tone was a strange mix of wry amusement and incredible disappointment. Once he was on his feet, Minato coughed into his fist as a light blush stained his features. Straightening his tie, the con-man spoke.\n\n\"Strength isn't everything. How many super-villains do you remember just because they smashed something?\" Kitsune smiled conspiratorially, leaning forward like he was sharing some delicate secret. \"The true villains possess something more powerful than physical might. They have style.\" Pilot nodded a few times before laughing derisively.\n\n\"You're so full of shit.\" Frowning at the slight, Minato resorted to the age-old retort of sticking his tongue out at the soldier. Pilot continued chuckling quietly beneath his helmet, marching off to continue securing the building. Watching him go, Minato winced at the pain shooting up his arms. His powers had always mitigated the necessity of actually working before, leaving him ill-prepared for even limited physical labour. Still, he noted idly to himself, things were shaping up well. The museum itself was slowly being locked down, entrances barricaded and windows covered however they could. Sarge had managed to set-up a generator in the basement, providing the troopers with limited light, and the advanced scouts had returned with a layout of the area. As far as tactical situations went, it could have been worse.\n\n\"You guys got that cappuccino machine installed yet?\" Kitsune started as a grey blur skid to a stop next to him, materialising into Event Horizon. The speedster looked around expectantly, as if waiting for someone to hand him a cup of scalding hot coffee. When no such beverage appeared, he looked distinctly unimpressed. \"Private military forces, man. They don't make them like they used to.\" Sighing despondently, the ballet dancing super-villain zipped off once more. Minato found himself unable to decide which was more impressive: The speed at which he vanished or the nonchalance of the troops around them. A savage howling erupted from a floor beneath them, so intense as to shake the building itself. While a scant few paramilitary agents reached for weaponry, most of them simply steeled themselves against the chilling fear that crept down their spines.\n\n\"What do you mean you you cannot acquire a virgin sacrifice? I require sustenance in order for my dread powers to function!\" The smooth, imperial tone of Baron Rotezhan floated up though the floor. Minato winced, entirely uncomfortable about working with an empowered cannibal. Event Horizon may have been flighty and difficult to keep on track but Barghast was quite literally a monster. The charismatic youth was uncertain how Pinnacle expected this loose affiliation of misfits to function as anything even mildly resembling a team but this was all they had to work with. \"I understand that we are here on a relief mission but a man must eat, yes? Do you expect me to stave off hunger with will alone?\" Such was Rotezhan's indignation that Minato could not help but laugh, even as a shudder of disgust trembled through him.\n\n\"Sir?\" Sarge appeared off of Kitsune's elbow, a stalwart sentinel. Turning to regard the military operator, Minato smiled thankfully. With such overwhelming odds stacked against them, it was good to have Sarge in their corner. Now that he had Kitsune's attention, the commander continued speaking. \"The museum has been locked down. We found a sewer entrance that we've welded a steel plate over and we've booby-trapped the grounds.\" Sarge began to walk, heading up one of the many stairwells, and his addresse followed. The duo made their way to the make-shift war room, a large chamber that had been emptied and then filled with maps of New York. They had jury-rigged the VTOL's holo-projector into a roof unit, now illuminating the maps with real-time updates on Zel'tan activity. The table had a smattering of lists taped to it, denoting everything from available ammunition to dry rations.\n\n\"What's the news, Sarge? Are we up the creek without a paddle?\" Minato quipped with a wink, though the effect was somewhat diminished looking at the blank gas-mask that the commando always seemed to be wearing. He sighed, rubbing his forehead. \"That bad? Should I bring the others in?\" Without waiting for a response, he activated his communicator and cleared his throat. \"Event Horizon? Barghast? Could the two of you come to the war room please? Sarge's scouts have returned and he wants to debrief us.\" The duo appeared in seconds as the speedster came hurtling up the stairs, arriving just as Baron Rotezhan passed through the stone floor. Minato grinned at the two of them. \"Gentlemen, thank you for the speedy response.\" He turned to the patiently waiting specialist with a gesture. \"All yours, Sarge.\" The man in question nodded once before speaking in a clipped tone.\n\n\"Forward reconnaissance reports that the surrounding area, while clear for now, has seen Zel'tan patrols recently. Signs of civilians but no contact was made. At least thirteen locations for potential supplies within half a klick.\" Sarge indicated the relevant points on the map. \"That's the good news. The bad news? Williams reported that those Talon fighters are doing sweeps of the city. The patterns are fairly typical for military operations but it makes things more difficult. We're also getting reports in from around the globe.\" He gestured towards the holo-projector with a gloved hand and a seperate window formed in the air, depicting ground conflict with the Zel'tan. The trio winced as towering lizard-men unleashed waves of heat on defending soldiers. \"As you can see, the Zel'tan utilise advanced flamethrowers with a range of almost three hundred feet. Our armour is calibrated to resist high temperatures but these high pressure, high intensity flames have been shown melting steel.\"\n\n\"Don't get hit by one of those then. Fucking hell.\" Event Horizon was flippant, even in his unease. Barghast nodded his agreement, one thin hand caressing his chin in contemplation.  \n\n\"Any strikes against these vile creatures must be done from a position of stealth. We have few enough advantages that we must utilise them all to their fullest potential. Ambush assaults, well-placed traps and overwhelming force.\" Barghast spoke with a low, ominous drawl. \"I believe that our issue with that will be a lack of supplies and able warriors. Our first port of call should be bolstering our ranks.\" Sarge nodded while Event Horizon sighed wearily.\n\n\"Can't it be our first mission to acquire some coffee?\" The caffiene addict tried to emulate Barghast's verbosity but fell just short. Minato grinned good-naturedly while Barghast rolled his eyes. \"Fine, fine.\" Event Horizon grumbled quietly. Minato leaned across the map, gesturing at a point further in the city.\n\n\"How about Fort Hamilton? United States military at it's finest. We might find a few willing hands there. If not, we can scavenge for weapons and supplies.\" The suggestion was met with some noises of interest as each of them put some thought into it. Eventually, the gathered group decided that this was not a bad idea. Sarge would put together a team to accompany the villains to the Fort while the others prepared in whatever way they could. Minato straightened his suit and studided the routes, commiting them to memory, while Barghast assumed his shadowy predator form. Event Horizon threw himself into a new routine, leaping across an empty room with an ecstatic energy. Finally, they were doing something. \n\nA short break from the story to explain a few key factors to you. I was running this game for a pair of friends, Red Leader and Twitch from some of my other stories, and a new player who was a really nice fellow. Word got out around our local gaming store that I was running a Mutants and Masterminds game. As it turned out, we were approached by someone who was incredibly pleased about such a thing. It was his favourite game system and he knew every rule off by heart, he said. He had even prepared a character that he thought would suit the game and would not play anything else, would not even entertain the notion. That should have been my first notion but this was one of the first games that I had ever run, so I did not realise what was happening until it was too late.\n\nOur newest player was That Guy. His character was a poorly min-maxed attempt at power gaming: Someone wielding an incredibly powerful suit of technological armor but who had absolutely zero technical skills and very poor attributes. This is what Iron Man would be like without his resources, intelligence or ability to interact with anything without the suit. The story was that his character had stumbled upon this highly advanced weapons platform when the Zel'tan attacked Fort Hamilton and was about to take it out for the first test flight when he joined the game. He came up with some suitably generic moniker but because of his complete lack of social skills, both in game and out of character, the team christened him the Iron Wanker. You may be wondering why I have spent a perfectly good paragraph describing our newest team member. Well wonder no more!\n\nIt was an impressive piece of maneuvering, ensuring that the scavenging team made it to Fort Hamilton without encountering any Zel'tan patrols. Passing between alleyways, ducking into subways and generally keeping their heads down had paid off in full. With tactical coverage from Sarge, the team had arrived at their destination in no time. Fort Hamilton had been one of the first assault sites in New York and it certainly showed: The walls were gently smoking piles of cinder, charred corpses littered the battlefield and the main courtyard had been reduced to rubble. Deciding not to take any chances, the seven man team had taken up residence behind a scorched army truck. Minato was desperately trying to keep himself from hyper-ventilating, his body trembling from the adrenaline. He had never been in a situation that even vaugely resembled this one and it was starting to show. The con-man's attempts to regain control of his shuddering frame were not at all assisted by Event Horizon skidding to a stop next to him.\n\n\"I've checked the outer perimeter. No-one here but the dead.\" Even the usually casual speedster was somber. The stench of decay lingered in the air around them, smothering his typical irreverence. He held his staff at the ready, hands clenched white beneath his gloves. There was a guttural growl from beside him as the shadowy form of Barghast coalesced through the concrete. The nightmarish lupine-human hybrid chuffed thrice before speaking in a reverberating rumble.\n\"This place reeks of decay. The scent of seared flesh is a delight upon my palate but something even more enticing awaits inside.\" The beast took another deep whiff of air, a shuddering chuckle shaking his frame. \"The spark of life yet remains within the fortress. What a poor guest I would be if I did not introduce myself to our host.\" Despite being a monstrous creature composed of darkness and murder, a very human sarcasm found it's way into his tone. Despite his unnerving appearance and deeply unsettling words, the mercenary team alongside them was unfazed. The tactical operatives remained stoic, weapons raised. Minato sighed to himself, wringing his hands anxiously.\n\n\"How about you don't do that. Alright, here's the deal. Salvage squad, I want two of you on look-out and two of you stripping this place of whatever you can find. I don't care if you need to steal a truck to do it but I don't want a single pile of scrap left in this place when we leave. Barghast, Event Horizon...\" For the first time since entering New York City proper, Kitsune seemed comfortably in his element. Straightening his tie, the charismatic super-human strode forward with a confident grin on his face. \"Let's go see who we've got.\" The group seperated, each with their own tasks to focus on. Event Horizon and Barghast flanking their self-appointed leader as the trio of villains slipped inside the ruins of Fort Hamilton itself. While Baron Rotezhan slipped through the wall of detritus as effortlessly as a ghost, his more tangible colleagues were forced to scurry through the fallen concrete. Graceful though he may have been in social settings, the most suave man alive was more than clumsy enough to knock a stray rock free from the pile. The sound echoed through the desolate halls and directly into the only chamber still occupied.\n\nFurther down the hallway, a very pale young man grew just slightly more white. Someone was coming now, he knew that much. Nervous eyes flittered between his exit, a collapsed wall over-looking the harbour, and his prize in all of this: A colossal suit of armour, suspended from the miraculously intact ceiling by some heavy-duty chains. He had only now managed to crack open a portion of the casing, after several hours of trying, but the young man knew that this weapons platform was his best bet at surviving the alien attack. It took him a few moments to make a decision but he acted with respectable haste, trying to slip inside the armour to rest inside. It was this image that the three scavengers stumbled upon: A partially destroyed chamber housing one of mankind's most advanced battlesuits, currently hanging from the roof while a scrawny teenager wriggled inside. There was silence for a good long while as staring commenced at each other. It was Minato who finally broke the silence, a little confused.\n\n\"Hi there. Sorry, what are you doing?\" There was a hesitant cough from the teen in the armour. His voice was the high-pitched whine of someone used to being in trouble.\n\n\"Nothing. Just...just don't move.\" It was a pale appoximation of a command, enough to cause Barghast's hackles to rise.\n\n\"Watch your tone, you impudent whelp! I suggest you choose your words more carefully lest I tear the tongue from your mouth.\" The air grew chill at his hissed threat, an aura of dread seeping forth from the cannibal. The boy shrunk further back into the armour, his fear transforming into full blown panic. Event Horizon rolled his eyes in irritation, even as he instinctually edged away from the glowering monster. Minato raised his hands and tried to calm the situation down.\n\n\"Alright, easy there. I think there might have been some miscommunication here. Pretty sure that we're all here for the same thing, so there's no reason for anyone to get hurt.\" It was meant as reassuring and would have been taken as such by anyone else in the world. Sadly, this was not someone else. This was a hyper-active, paranoid teenager with delusions of grandeur. As such, his response was almost predictable.\n\n\"You can't have it! It's mine!\" With that terrified proclamation, the hapless fool had a stroke of luck: He found the engage command. The armor snapped shut around him and, with an electrical hum, powered up. No longer were our protagonists dealing with a slight, terrified teenager. Now, they faced a towering juggernaut equipped with bleeding edge military equipment and enough armour plating to make a super-heavy tank blush. Cocconed inside his deadly suit, the suddenly confident teenager crowed at his wary audience. \"Now who's in charge?! It's me! I'm in charge now!\" Aided by the impressive hydraulics in his suit, he tore the chains away and slammed into the floor. As the dust from his impact settled, the powered frame rose to it's full height. Each of them took a small step back as he raised his arms threateningly, weaponry bristling from them. \"Now, you stand the hell there and shut up! This is mine and none of you can have it.\"\n\n\"Kid...do you even know how to use it? Do you know the intricacies of the suit or what it's powered by? Did you know that an advanced alien race has attacked Earth and we are it's best chance at fighting back?\" Gone was the reassuring diplomat of seconds before. Minato was cold in his logic and ruthless in his execution. \"If you, by some miracle, manage to activate those aramaments and try to take us out; the Zel'tan will come and empty your ashes out of that fancy armour.\" Barghast and Event Horizon watched on, both impressed and slightly bewildered. \"That's your first option. The second? You come with us and make something of your life.\" Minato dusted some dirt off of his jacket contemptuously before turning a haughty glare onto the figure before him. \"The choice is yours. Fight us and die or come with us.\" Though none of them could see it, the teen was shaking inside the carapace of his armour. His voice, distorted by the malfunctioning vocal modulator, sounded like nothing so much as Mickey Mouse on helium.\n\n\"Sh...shut up! I'm calling the shots here! Not you!\" Kitsune smiled thinly at this, a cold glint in his eyes.\n\n\"Judging by the fact that you hadn't dropped the armour beforehand and that it took you so long to get inside the damn thing, you have absolutely no idea how to pilot that suit. So, let me make one thing very clear...\" As Minato trailed off, an ethereal blue glow lit the entire room up. Shimmering flames erupted from beneath Kitsune's suit, surrounding him in a tempestuous inferno. The fire never moved more than a foot away from him, shifting in transfixing patterns across his body. \"We are fucking super-villains. We are the worst of the worst and you are a silly little boy with a very shiny toy. You would not be more than a stain on the concrete and we would walk away without injury.\" The normally civil man held an echoing quality to his tone now, a certain supernatural quality that was deeply unsettling. \"So now we're back at the beginning. Keep pretending that you're in charge and you will die or stop being an idiot...come with us and make a name for yourself.\" There was no noise in the moments that followed: No movement, no breath. The only sound was the electricity running through the suit. Finally, after many long moments, a voice emerged. \n\n\"Okay.\" The light died away instantly as the flames vanished and Minato smiled pleasently. \n\n\"Good. Now, do you have a name?\" The sheer nonchalance of the statement struck his partners for a loop. The iron giant before them nodded his head slowly before speaking.\n\n\"Lawrence Terry but, uh, I was thinking about the Steel Soldier...\" Event Horizon laughed openly, mockingly, while Barghast spat in disgust. Minato sighed, in the way an exasperated parent would to an irascible child.\n\n\"We'll work on a more...appropriate moniker. Will you please put that contraption to good use and help our friends get everything loaded up? Thank you, Lawrence.\" Though slow to react, the hulking suit slowly stomped out towards the courtyard. As his booming footfalls receeded, Minato laughed quietly to himself.\n\n\"Lawrence...silly little fool. Who tells super-villains their real name?\" Smiling cruelly, Kitsune turned back to his cohorts. \"Someone radio through to Sarge that we have a new resource? We'll need to be...\" They were staring at him with bewildered smiles. \"What?\" Event Horizon chuckled happily, spinning his staff in a dizzying pattern.\n\n\"I really wasn't sure about you before but now I'm absolutely sure: You're fucking crazy!\" The speedster zipped away, laughing all the while. Minato watched him go with a detached fascination before turning to Barghast. The infamous murderer stared back with something approaching approval in his beastial gaze.\n\n\"Perhaps there is some merit in Pinnacle's plans after all, my friend.\" Minato bowed in response. Barghast vanished, phasing through the wall without another word. Kitsune smiled as he left, glad that no-one had seen him shaking from fear. Once he was alone, the facade broke and he collapsed to his knees with an explosive gasp. He took a few deep breaths, listening to the hustle of equipment being loaded outside, before murmuring to himself.\n\n\"God fucking damn it, me and my mouth. My mother always said that my silver-tongue would get me into trouble.\" He glanced at his surroundings, at the view of a devastated city spanning out before him. Kitsune straightened up, trying to brush away the dirt from his sleeves. \"I don't know how many more tricks I've got up these sleeves...but I guess we're going to find out.\"",

        "text": "I've always been a calm person. Well, at least after leaving school and getting away from my cringy 'CoD is the best game EVAR' phase (I'm not bashing CoD, I've just broadened my horizons). When I play games now I prefer tactical and challenging ones that can really be different each and every time you play, hence I purchased Rainbow Six: Siege.\n\nIf you don't know, Siege is a 5 vs. 5 competitive game mode where one team defends a hostage/bomb/area etc. from the attacking team. You can select from a variety of characters who each have a special ability, from a guy with EMP grenades to a person who can revive teammates from a distance. The game is heavily oriented around the title itself, with the attackers attempting a Siege on the location heavily fortified by the defenders who also have barbed wire, reinforcements (to make walls unbreachable), wooden barricades over doors and whatnot. The game's core mode (casual) is this, and everybody has one life in each round. If they die they go on cameras and can spot the enemies, or they spectate another character. This goes until one team reaches 3 wins. Ranked is very similar to casual except you choose where you spawn, what location on the map to defend and you need to win by two rounds (getting at least 4 wins). \n\nAnd finally, I have to explain a bit about the special characters in this story. Ash has a 2 shot grenade launcher that destroys barricades and walls instantly and from range (normally you need to break it open or place a breaching charge which are both noisy and require you to be right next to it), Recruit is the default class with access to all weapons but no special ability, Thermite has two charges that can breach through reinforced walls and finally Doc, a defense character who can revive allies from a distance, as well as himself if he's downed.\n\n\nNow to the story. Me and some friends decided we would go and play some ranked, seeing as we had a full team and we tested our skills on some casual together and did very well. Unfortunately, however, one of the better teammates in our team had to go beforehand so we got a quick replacement. We start searching and get the Hostage game mode on the map Kanal (Hostage is where one team needs to, obviously, grab the hostage and escape, or kill the entire enemy team). The first attack round passed well and we won, The second round the enemy team were sneaky little shits and had one of them attack from behind and grab the hostage from under our noses. The next round we were doing ok until one of them went crazy with a shotgun and took out the other 3 guys on my team, leaving me alone against 4 players. We lost that round. Then we defended again and I thought it'd be smart for me to break open a little hole in a barricaded window. I was sniped and killed instantly. We lost. it was at this time that the replacement on our team AS WELL as a guy on their team got disconnected from the game and ended up never joining back in, leading to a 4v4 match.\n\nDown 3 to 1 we devised our strategy for the next round. The enemy chose to use the Boat Room location, which has a wall that can be breached from outside of the building area. They'd reinforced it and we hadn't picked a Thermite, but that was ok because I rappelled up the side of the area and shot a hole above the top of the reinforcement. A total of 3 of them got taken down by my headshots before they realized where I was and starting trying to shoot back, but by that time I pushed into the door next to the wall and took out the only other guy in the hostage room at the exact time another teammate killed a guy on the top floor, clinching us the round.  \n\nThe next round we were defending in the same room they had just been in. It started very, very poorly as I killed my friend when he ran in front of me whilst I was shooting at a drone. It was actually kind of funny how everyone was so quiet for the next 5 seconds as the little kill feed showed the headshot in the corner before I whispered 'sorry...'. However, due to the whole team being turtles and staying inside the hostage room (and me getting a lucky through-wall headshot) we managed to win. \n\nWe were now tied at 3 to 3 and for our next attack I chose a character called Montagne, who has a large extendable shield that protects his entire front from all damage except explosive (he can't shoot or melee when in this mode though). We were pushing very, very well until a I got caught inside a welcome mat trap (basically a bear trap) and my team began to get systematically picked off one by one. The final player, in terror, ran into the hostage room to try and grab him and run off as the remaining enemies poured fire around him. Miraculously, he managed to avoid the bullets.\n\n\n\nBy hiding behind the hostage. The defenders killed the hostage and we won the round. \n\n\nFinally was the last round and we picked the control room. This room needs a bit of explanation. It's on the top floor of one side of the map and has the whole left side of it covered in windows. The back left of it has a small segment away from the windows but is breachable from behind with anything, except if reinforced. To the right of the entrance into the room is a small hallway with a column to hide behind at the back as well as an entrance into the room on the other side [picture is here, it is the 'electric room'](http://cdn4.gamepur.com/images/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/rainbow-six-seige-camera-location-kanal-2.jpg). We reinforced everything that we could and just waited, staying the HELL away from the windows. Their Thermite breached the room at the far left (in front of 'roof brick pile') and started just looking for a shot. I knew he was there and quickly peeked out and sprayed in the general direction I thought he'd be. as I moved out of cover, time seemed to slow and I saw his shiny black helmet sticking up from behind the roof brick pile. Something I just so happened to be aiming perfectly at. I fired and got a headshot and an instant kill, taking out one of the most vital attacking characters in the game. Soon after, a teammate was killed with a headshot as well, through one of the windows. I peeked to see where they were quickly and was downed pretty much instantly from another shot. One of my other teammates ran over to me to revive (even though I could revive myself) and then HE got shot. I slowly crawled past the window and into a fairly safe place before reviving myself. As I did this though, one of them must have found an angle on me and I heard hit after hit on me as I slowly got back up, dropping my health all the way from 75 to 16. As I was continued to be shot at I just through caution to the wind and sprinted into the Electric Room. I was tagged on the way, now at 3 health. \n\nThe next 2 minutes were a fierce 2 v 3 standoff, everyone just waiting and wondering what in the hell to do. It was extremely tense, trying to listen to anything we could, dead teammates frantically switching through cams as they were shot out one by one, giving us no extra information. \n\nFinally, one of them struck. A guy jumped in through a window and ran to grab the hostage. My teammate tried to take him down but was taken out. The enemy then grabbed the hostage and tried to flee through the window, but I'd planned ahead. I had put my barbed wire around the hostage and this slowed him long enough for me to get out of my hiding spot and shoot him in the back, killing him. \n\n\n1 vs. 2. 1 minute left. \n\n\nI stayed in my hiding spot, listening to the noises that were going on around me. So many breaches, so many explosions, it was almost disorienting, but I kept watch. I zoned out slightly from my teammates yelling about stuff, aching to hear the footsteps. Suddenly, a breaching round from Ash slammed into the wall in front of me. A chorus of loud 'NO!'s erupted from my friends as it exploded, but it was too far to do the 3 damage it needed to.\"Stay calm, everyone...\" I said, oddly placid in such a tense moment. \n\n30 seconds left. I slowly heard one slinking up to the left side of the entrance. I have no clue why they thought it was a good idea to attack ME when the hostage was right by the window, but I guess they wanted to prove a point. The guy obviously thought that Ash's round should have killed me if I was standing where I was so he didn't even check behind him, allowing me to shoot him dead as well. \n\n15 seconds left. 1 vs. 1.\n\nI heard their Ash sprint up the stairs behind me, running into the server room on my right. My heart pounded as I waited, eyes flicking from entrance to entrance, health to ammo count. 5 seconds left... The barricaded door in front of me started to be bashed open and I saw Ash there like something out of The Shining. I spammed bullets at her and began to sprint out of the room, she aimed back at me about to kill me...\n\n'Time limited reached. Good job'.\n\nI almost collapsed. I had dealt with the whole enemy team that round, mostly at only 3 health. I had won the game for my team with a tense, terrifying stand-off that I shouldn't have won. Both sides had made terrible mistakes and we both payed dearly, but somehow, somehow, I managed to pull through at the end. I ended up going 12 kills to 2 deaths in that match and it has to be one of the absolute craziest experiences I've ever had in a while. I could hear my heart pounding in the last 2 minutes of the match and hear it for the next 5 minutes after.\n\n\n\nAnd I loved every minute of it.",

I really enjoy this one, it puts into contrast the difference in ability between a force sensitive character and a Jedi.

        "text": "This is a continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4i3c3s/the_disapearing_tavern/) post.\n\nLast we left off the party had  just watched the tavern disappear, but they had more important concerns, chief among them, getting supplies and weapons for the revolution. Coraim asked a townsman if he knew of any nearby armories or forts, and the man said that Fort Cox was just a little to the north, about a day away on foot. So the party set off, the trek there was uneventful but when eventually the saw a fort in a clearing of the forest.\n\nThe plan to get in was for Coraim to use disguise self to look like a battered soldier, tie Vido's hands, and lead him to the gates, claiming that he was the last survivor of a patrol from another fort that was attacked by bandits and he had managed to capture one of the bandits. Iaghar and Lexter were waiting in the bushes, if they saw sparks coming up (from prestidigitation) they would come help. The guards were suspicious and thought Coraim was a deserter, and asked for his papers. Coraim handed the guard the identification he had forged to get into the census bureau earlier, even though it had a different face on it, the guard questioned \"Dimple Mermaid\" and asked why his face looked different, to which Coraim responded \"I seem to have grown a different face\". At this point Coraim used prestidigitation to alert Iaghar and Lexter. After a surprise round of combat Vido managed to untie himself. After a couple rounds all the guards were dead. Next, the party went to the outhouse (why not?) and opened the door. There was a man inside the outhouse, who Iaghar almost immediately punched in the cherries... and rolled a natural 20. Since we play that a critical hit explodes what it hits, you can guess what happened. Vido then grabbed the man by the neck, who was now sobbing in pain, and yelled \"WHERE'S THE ARMORY MOTHERFUCKER?!\". The man continued sobbing and moaning \"my cherries\" and eventually revealed where the armory was when we told him we could heal him, spoiler alert, we couldn't. Eventually we just put him out of his misery... and then Vido pissed on his corpse, reasoning that it's okay because we're in an outhouse.\n\nFollowing that whole sordid affair, we went off to the armory. The armory door was locked, so Vido tried to pick the lock... but rolled a natural 1, and his lockpick broke. He then tried to kick down the door... and rolled a natural 1, and his foot broke, karma if you ask me. After that Lexter used acid splash to melt the door... and rolled a natural 20, so it not only destroyed the door but also killed a guard behind it. After killing the guards in the armory we loaded a bunch of weapons and other stuff into a carriage we found, including 50 alchemist's fires (not a good thing to give us given our history).\n\nAfter loading the carriage we opened the gate and rode out while being fired on by guards and throwing alchemist's fire at all the wooden buildings we saw. Lexter was driving the carriage and was knocked unconscious by a crossbow bolt, but since we had looted several wands of healing from the armory we just spammed cure minor wounds on him to keep him above 0. Eventually we got out of the gates with much of the fort burning behind us (DM wouldn't let us burn the outhouse though, said we'd desecrated the corpse enough) and that's where the session ended.",

        "text": "I'm skipping past the panic/anxiety attac because I don't feel like trying to describe a state of mind that can be summed up like this. Your body has just discovered that your brain has overdosed on its own chemicals and responds by contemplating its existence, only to realize existentialism is the brain's job and not the body's. Things only go downhill from there.\n\n\nLong story short, I'm feeling better.\n\n\nLet's get into it shall we?\n\n\nOur heroes henceforth being referred to as Dog Lady and Cute Guy are sitting in a sunroom of sorts in the middle of an evil lair. Home to their evil but honestly quite fair and well meaning employer Magus Bruun. He is an morally questionable man with lots of money and very little hindsight.\n\nThey are watching him perform an evil ritual meant to destroy one of gods loyal Angels and a powerful reality warping angel whose purpose is to help the purest individual defend the world. \n\n\nBruun's reasoning is unclear to our Dog Lady and Cute Guy. Both failed a history check. (This will likely be a reoccurring theme since they both totally suck at history and I have their numbers and they are the only people I know that like this game)\n\n\nCute Guy succeeds with a perception check and BOOM the real heroes crash the ritual and proceed to quickly incapacitate Bruun and try to convince him to give up his evil ways with the power of true friendship and love. Dog Lady fails a willpower save and face palms herself for 1 non lethal damage. Cute Guy succeeds a persuasion directed at Bruun for even considering love a legitimate option by giving Bruun the finger. (I may be considering love an option at this point myself)\n\n\nBruun blows himself up but not without taking the True Heroe's pet mascot with him as a big \"FU\" to the good guys and that's where it ends. \n\n\nDog Lady had to take dog home and Cute Guy and I started talking about the Saga comics.\n\n\nI (hopefully) will return with a continuation of this story in the future. I will try to limit the story exposition for my players and increase it for you in the future.",
