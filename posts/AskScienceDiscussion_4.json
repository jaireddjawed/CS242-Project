Her heart stopped twice after arriving at the hospital and she was placed on life support. Doctors attempted to lower her body temperature to prevent additional brain injury. She was declared clinically dead for 17 hours after doctors failed to detect brain activity. Her son, Tim Thomas, stated that \"her skin had already started hardening, her hands and toes were curling up, they were already drawn\". She was taken off life support and funeral arrangements were in progress. However, ten minutes after being taken off life support, she revived and recovered.[18][19]\n\nDo you think this is real or made up?

Inspired by this initial research, many social scientists proceeded to examine the associations of oxytocin with trust in humans over the past decade. In a large-scale review, Gideon and his colleagues have dissected the current oxytocin research to understand whether findings are robust and replicable. Turns out, they are not. However, even though the findings were established to be false, they keep propagating throughout the scientific record.\"\n\n**False / incomplete / novel scientific findings becoming \"irreversibly\" popularized**\n\nI am looking for similar examples of findings which are used as primary literature to back up pop-sci / trendy claims, even though they have been falsified by subsequent publications.\n\nPreferably, examples should include a somewhat \"linear\" progression of specific scientific publications (meaning without branching off indefinitely and creating a complex web of conflicting information which is difficult to navigate without scientific background). Ergo, perhaps Covid-Related findings should be excluded for the sake of maintaining conceptual simplicity - unless the example is particularly straightforward.\n\nPerhaps you have come across some examples throughout your time in academia. I would highly appreciate any insights. Thanks in advance!",

For a typical jet engine, some of the air is super compressed before being mixed and ignited with chemical fuel, and if it were meant to power a supersonic jet, then after the ignition stage there'd be another stage where even more fuel is dumped and ignited in order to produce more thrust. For nuclear-powered jet engines, I suppose the reactor produces heat that is fed into a set of heat exchangers that compresses and heats up the air flowing into an engine before exiting the other side with more thrust. However, if we want it to go supersonic, then could it be possible to use a second set of nuclear heat exchangers, as an equivalent to traditional afterburners, to compress and heat up the air even more so that it can produce thrust sufficient enough to get the plane up to supersonic speed?",

[Here's an article on this technique.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02334-2)\n\nI've seen these \"synthetic embryos\" referred to as \"mocks\", \"facsimiles\", and \"models\". But is this misleading? It appears they do not develop arbitrarily like a cellular aggregate, and they have more organization than a teratoma, but as a rule their development arrests before viability (whether due to lack of capacity or insufficient environment appears unknown). It seems they can't orchestrate a body plan in entirety. Does this make a synthetic embryo a whole organism that lacks an essential part, or part of an organism that is not whole on its own?\n\n**Are these synthetic embryos mere derivatives of organisms? Or are they deficient organisms? And WHY?**",

If you didn't make sure that this wasn't possible, and then it actually happened, then you'd be going up and up and up (trying to combat the adaptation) when really you just needed to go downwards. And tragically, you'd quit the drug thinking that it was impossible to go high enough to overcome the adaptation; you wouldn't know that the answer was to try a lower dose.",

I was referred to a 4 essential oils kit sold by NeilMed, which seems to follow what this article states: https://www.enthealth.org/be_ent_smart/smell-retraining-therapy/\n\nAfter using these \"nasal inhalers,\" I realized that the manner in which the instructions are asking you to use them hits you with SUCH a strong smell, it's overpowering, and overstimulating...  Shouldn't the approach be to tease yourself with a hint of that smell.. and try to detect more and more of it by \"challenging\" yourself? Rather than stuffing it up your nose, and making your smell receptors go on red alert?\n\nI'm also a little skeptical that just 4 scents (lemon, eucalyptus, clove, and rose) will somehow cover the vast type of smells there are... \n\nI suspect that a better approach might be to try and smell everything and anything you come across (as long as its not toxic) and try to \"detect\" it from further and further away... Thereby becoming more sensitive/attuned to different smells. \n\nFor example... I have a raw banana in front of me right now... and as you know, they have a very faint smell... I'm closing my eyes and concentrating on it's smell... Next I'm going to focus on another benign/very faint odor - the smell of my cuff (cotton cloth) and see if I can pick up that odor... \n\nWouldn't this be a better way to \"train\" your nose?

A lot of time travel seems to depict matter moving through time as if “time” is a pocket dimension that can be moved through on the way from point A to point B. But time influences matter  and is in turn influenced by the mass of matter (if memory serves), the example being that “time” is not moving equally everywhere and is in fact moving slower the nearer to large masses it gets such as black holes or even planetary bodies. \n\nSo if time and even gravity are just measurable ways that matter effects itself as matter goes through cycles of entropy and transformation then it seems reasonable that sci-fi style time travel wouldn’t work because to go back or forwards in “time” would require an incomprehensible amount of energy because you would need to isolate all the matter relevant to the traveler from the cycle of entropy. Everything that makes up the time traveler, their machine, their location, their version of where all matter is when they “left,” the very air they need to survive would all need to be kept separate but stable while all other matter would need to have their entropic cycles sped up or slowed down. \n\nThe sheer force required seems like it could do something catastrophic at a subatomic level if all the matter in existence suddenly had to shift. Is time just the visible effect of entropy upon matter or am I way off course with this? Thanks in advance!",

People forced you to do things to survive with the group and people had less say in things. As we became more successful as a species and more plentiful we gained the idea of rights. Relationships are now less one sided and as a result don't last as long which leads to less reproduction overall. Also more people leads to more freedom overall because there's less room to care or control people so we can live how we want and not feel pressure to reproduce as it's not completely necessary on an individual level. This all gradually leads to less population and that's not even counting viruses and illness from high concentration of populations or conflict like wars. Obviously this is a phenomenon, but I just wonder if it's supposed to be weird that nature and the universe just works like this, or if it makes perfect sense. \n\nI get that if you had a bunch of rats in a box they would eventually stop reproducing because there'd be no room so that part makes total sense. It feels like there's more to it because it becomes so nuanced as humans in how our behaviors change in society like I mentioned above. What about nature is responsible for this or is it an overarching phenomenon of the concept of life in the universe?",

        "text": "Hi, no formal degree in Physics here, but I’ve always had an amateur interest. I’m struggling with understanding why thinking about gravity as a curvature of spacetime instead of as a force should matter.\n\nThe conventional argument seems to be that GR can explain observed phenomena such as the procession of Mercury &amp; gravitational lensing, but Newton’s laws cannot.\n\nBut I’ve come across papers [such as this one](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=111378) that show that with a relatively simple modification, Newton’s Gravitational Theory can explain both:\n\n* The precession of Mercury\n* Light deflection / gravitational lensing\n\nDoes this mean that the issue with Newton’s laws is only a mathematical one, maybe arising out of the fact the speed of light was not known at the time? And that once the math is fixed, it is not incorrect to think about gravity as a force?\n\nBy extension, would modified Newton’s Gravitational Theory also be able to explain time dilation? Why or why not?\n\nFinally, on a somewhat related note, is time dilation a quirk of the way we measure time? Or would it also impact other phenomenon, such as biological again? For example, in Interstellar would Matthew McConaughey continue to age according to earth time, even if the clocks on his spaceship move far more slowly when navigating through strong gravitational fields?\n\nPS - Apologies if some of this has been discussed earlier. I have gone through related discussions [such as this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2pqvyv/why_is_general_relativity_needed_to_describe/), but don’t think I have a good understanding yet.",

If not, what environmental pressures are the most likely to drive the development of our species?\n\n2) If we do evolve to a degree that the human skeleton is as distinguishable from early Homo sapiens as our skeletons are from Homo habilis, would future scientists call themselves a new species within the genus Homo?\n\nSorry if this question is too hypothetical or if it has too many qualifiers.

Scientists have shown that someone with a verified allergy will not have a reaction to an allergen if they are hypnotised into believing they're no longer allergic to the allergen. Their immune systems actually ignore the allergen. It's also been proven that thinking about an allergen causes antibodies to be made specific to the allergen, causing an allergy (Pavlovian Conditioning). The brain and the body are closely connected. If the brain is convinced it is allergic to something, so will the immune system. If the brain is convinced it is no longer allergic to something, the immune system will be as well. Just because the immune system is a physical system doesn't mean it isn't controlled by thoughts or the brain. Recently it has been discovered that trauma and stress have been associated with the development of allergies. Follow the science even if it goes against your worldview. As the years go by more and more scientists are becoming convinced that allergies are neuroimmunological.\n\nBabies can have allergies, babies can also be born with neurological disorders and phobias/aversions.\n\nThe brain controls virtually every physical system in your body. You can have a physical reaction just from thinking something since the brain controls pretty much every physical system in the body.\n\nBurn blisters can actually appear on your body if you're hypnotised into believing you are burned. That's a physical reaction caused by thought alone. There's been several cases of full-on stab wounds appearing on people's bodies after they remembered a particularly traumatic event in which they were once stabbed in the same area.

        "text": "I'm a writer, not a scientist, so this may be dumb. It seems like sandstorms on Earth are fairly harmless in the sense that the wind and the sand won't directly kill anyone (obviously it causes other issues that could be dangerous). If I wanted to write a world where there were frequent sandstorms that would kill anyone caught inside them, how could I make it at least somewhat believable?\n\nCould the wind speeds be high enough that the sand could skin someone alive? Or would it be more plausible that the sands would simply pile up so quickly that someone caught in it would be buried alive?",
