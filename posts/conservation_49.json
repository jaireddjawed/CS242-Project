A lot of positive word about the sanctuary, but also reviews floating around online of the trainers 'controlling' elephants so tourists can interact with them, something we wouldn't be happy spending our time contributing towards.\n\nAny help, however small, would be greatly appreciated and will hopefully set us on the right track to making our (albeit equally small) contribution. \n\n:-)",

For over 10 years, I have directed a project in Mali to preserve one of two remaining desert elephant herds in the world. **This is one of the most remarkable conservation projects I have had the privilege of implementing, and it has meant working in a vast region (approximately 8 million acres - a region the size of Switzerland!) that is both rugged and remote.** It is a roller-coaster ride, but despite the challenges, the Mali Elephant Project has successfully united multiple ethnic groups for the first time to collectively manage their natural resources for the benefit of elephants and themselves.\n\n**New challenges to this project arose in 2012, when a Tuareg Rebellion and Islamic insurgency threatened to topple Mali's government.** The elephant habitat was ground zero for this insurgency, and even though the rebellion was quelled by the French military, jihadists remain active in the elephant range. The insecurity emboldens poachers and **now, elephants are being poached to fuel international arms trafficking.** In January 2016, 16 elephants were slaughtered to support desperate and violent networks. Overcoming this type of opposition is difficult, very difficult, *and can only be effectively combatted by a strong coalition of international supporters.*\n\nTo learn more about me and how you can become a part of the work I am directing, please visit these links:\n\n[TEDxTalk: Punch Above Your Weight, Mali Elephant Project] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjYt5uQPu8o)\n\n[End Elephant Poaching in Mali](http://www.loveanimals.org/protecting-elephants.html)\n\n[Of Elephants and People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ8JA5eOG3k)\n\n[Thwart poachers and save elephants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP9_6qDPEPY)\n\nPlease join me on March 16, between 1:30 and 3:30 MST to ask me anything. I am eager to listen to your questions and feedback, and share more with you about my experiences with elephants in Mali’s vast deserts.\n",

        "text": "Hi!\n\nI work for a local volunteer recruitment agency on San Cristóbal Island, Galápagos, Ecuador. Because of budget constraints, the Galapagos National Park office for this island has appointed us as their sole direct recruiting agency.\n\nThe Galapagos National Park on San Cristobal Island is looking for professional volunteers to develop a fishing calendar for the entire Galapagos Marine Reserve and to help change the culture of fishing on the islands. This marine reserve includes the waters around the Galapagos Islands at a distance of 40 miles which is protected from industrial fishing and has limits on number of artesian fisherman. The Galapagos cannot survive without the protection of the marine ecosystem. A large part of the local population of Galapagos is economically dependent on the Galapagos Marine Reserve through artisanal fishing, but overfishing of species such as the sea cucumber and lobster have altered entire ecosystems and threaten the long-term resources, affecting not only nature in the Galapagos but also the profitability of fisheries. \n\nIn order to combat overfishing, the Galapagos National Park of San Cristobal is looking for a Sustainable Fisheries Technician to create a calendar on the different mating, breeding and optimal fishing seasons to promote sustainable fishing practices. The majority of data has already been collected for this calendar, but the park is looking for someone to aggregate the data into a working calendar, promote this shift in culture for fisherman to follow the almanack in order to protect the reserve and their livelihood, and to give insight into what further data should be collected. Volunteers would be working with the guidance of a park ranger but must be able to take initiative alone and have completed at least one year of Masters work in the related field. The majority of the role will be completed in the office, though some fieldwork may become necessary. Optional but a plus for those that ave sustainable commercial fishing practices experience.\n\nThis is an incredible opportunity to make a big impact on these very special islands. If you are interested you can apply [here](http://coastgalapagos.com/volunteer-application-form/)  and I will get back to you with more information. Please PM me if you have any further questions. Good luck! ",

I want to be conscious of my carbon footprint but also of landfill and toxins etc. \n\nI had a environmental scientist friends at uni who slated carbon offsetting, but as I'm not sure of what else I could do, some of the tree planting projects I've seen look to be a good cause so I think I would support that... don't really like how they use the tree's entire life's carbon intake to offset carbon though. Surely it should be a year's intake?\n\nAny, help appreciated",

        "text": "First, I wanted to say I am fully in favor of the preservation and conservation of manta and mobula rays. However, from an ecologic standpoint, would the removal of manta or mobula rays result in any significant changes in the ecosystem? \n\nThey are filter feeding, so it's not like there wouldn't be alternative predators to take their place. They, themselves, don't have many predators that would depend on them as a food source. So do they have a vital function in their ecosystems?\n\nI think they are beautiful and amazing creatures, but would their ecosystems be in dire straits if they disappeared? \n\n**I thought about submitting this in askscience, but thought this would be a better place to submit it. If you think otherwise, let me know and I'll move it.",

        "text": "In 2009, wild beavers were first reintroduced into Knapdale Forest in Argyll, Scotland after being extinct in the UK for over 400 years. It was the first official project of its kind in Britain and was followed by a five year study to explore how beavers enhance and restore natural environments. \n\n\nIn 2014, a colony of wild beavers were spotted living on the River Otter in Devon, England. The origin of the population is unknown, It is presumed to be the result of an escape or deliberate release. It is estimated that there are at least nine beavers on the river, including one confirmed breeding group. \n\n\nNatural England granted Devon Wildlife Trust a licence in January 2015 that allowed the beavers to remain on the river, as part of a pilot experiment and five year monitoring. At the conclusion of the project in 2020 the River Otter Beaver Trial will present Natural England with its evidence. Using this information a decision will be made on the future of the beavers on the river.\n\n\nScottish Natural Heritage have released the report ‘Beavers in Scotland’ which offers potential future beaver scenarios for Scottish Ministers to consider. The Scottish Beaver Trial is now in a holding period whilst awaiting the decision from the Scottish Government about the future for the beavers, but there is no news as of yet.\n\n\nThe beaver trial in England is ongoing and the surveying and monitoring is set to conclude in 2020, ready for the government to evaluate the evidence and come to a decision on the beavers remaining at the site in Devon, as well as potentially increasing trials to other locations.\n\n\nIt will be very interesting to see what they decide. The Scottish trials have been successful and benefits of having beavers living naturally is proven. \n\n\nAs well as this, the UK has obligations under the EU’s Habitats Directive to consider reintroductions of extinct native species, so reintroducing beavers to certain areas could also assist with this?
