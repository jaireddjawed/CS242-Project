This is all I recall from it, please tell me someone knows what I’m talking about!!:\n\n- The book is an the point of view of the girl, and it’s about a boy she meets.\n- there are like no pictures of this boy anywhere not even in the yearbook like he make sure there’s no pictures of him for anybody to find a receipt because he wants to disappear when he gets old enough\n-The girl and him actually become friends and they take a photo booth picture together and I don’t think he knew it was being taken and it’s like the only photo of him to ever exist like he either cuts out or removed himself from any baby pictures\n- He eventually does disappear and the girl doesn’t turn in the photo to the authorities to try to help for his search.\n- I think he reaches out to her low-key secretly but nothing comes from it",

        "text": "\tI know that this post isn’t exactly what is considered usual for this sub, but I don’t have anyone irl who shares my passion for reading and I just needed to share how I feel about reading with someone, even if they’re strangers on the Internet.\n\tI am a college student in my junior year, and with college has come all the stresses of homeworks and new responsibilities of living away from my parents and everything else. I can’t say that I’ve had the hardest time, but it has definitely not been easy. I picked up reading again last year, and ever since then I’ve been obsessed. Reading has helped me through the most painful, stressful parts of my life. It has been my companion during late nights and crowded bus rides. Without it, I don’t know if I could have found the strength to stay in college up to this point. What especially amazes me is how, whenever I need it the most, the perfect book finds its way into my lap. From books I have drawn strength, confidence, and the ability to go to sleep with a mind at peace. Books are amazing. I’m not eloquent enough to be an author so that’s the best I got.\n\tAnyway, feel free to DM me if you want to talk about books/recommend new ones! I love reading fantasy/scifi, with some other genres between books as a palate cleanser.",

I was recommended one of his books, and I can't believe there are people who actually buy this stuff. Not because of the content (which is for certain people who like a certain type of fantasy) but because it is so poorly written.

This vacation would unfortunately take a strange and horrifying turn when they come across smell that is like death and then a strange fish with legs.\n\nThat is when everything goes into chaos as an army of them begin to come out of the sea and the smell of death envelops the island. But it isn't the island of Okinawa that's under the threat of this bizarre occurrence.\n\nThis is a very creepy and bizarre story. But then again, all of Ito's work is creepy and bizarre. The things in \"Gyo\", including the legged fish and the \"death-stench\", are just so weird! I wish I could describe every single thing in this manga, but it's best no to spoil the whole thing. But anyhow this one of the best works in Ito's repertoire. Great, great stuff!",

We chose to use use covid times with her as a 3 year old getting well acquainted with the alphabet. Fast forward to now and she's in kindergarten kicking ass. We just had our first parent- teacher conference and we found out she topped off the benchmarks for reading ability on her teachers sheet. She reads every night before bed but only because it's all she has at that time. During the day she'd rather play pokemon cards or pokemon on her nintendo. We encourage her to spend some of her free time with a book but she's not about it and u go back and forth about pushing the issue. Her response is she's a good reader already and she enjoys it at bedtime. Completely reasonable, I think. But lately she's been really wanting the nintendo a lottttt. I'm fine letting her play but I don't want her in front of a screen as much as she'd like to be. I was thinking about making a rule that she could play nintendo for a much as she reads. I don't want to make it a chore and kill her fondness for it though. Do you guys think it's worth pushing her?\n\n!! Also I really want to get her a book but I can't remember wtf it was. I read it in 4th grade. It had a blue cover with a grandfather clock on it (I think), and there was a part with a person who opens different doors of his house for someone and introduces themselves as the shortest tall man in the world, and then the tallest short man in the world. I really want to see if she can handle that one. In all my years of summer reading that one sticks with me and I found it interesting. Can anyone help me remember which book that is?",

        "text": "To begin with let me quickly recap the author's first book Can't Hurt Me. It's an inspiring and amazing autobiographical tale of a man who overcame child abuse, racism, obesity, poverty and a learning disability and became a Navy SEAL, and elite ultra marathon runner. There's an emphasis on mastering your own mind and not letting the anxiety, insecurities, self destructive thoughts win. He talks about the 40% Rule; when you feel like you've given everything you have, when you have nothing left in the tank, you're really only 40% done. I've used this \"rule\" and surprised myself with how much more i had to give. David is always challenging himself in order to beat the weak voice in his head to tell him he's done, he's done enough, it's ok to quit and relax.\n\nNever Finished his his latest book and it's more the same as the first book with one big difference. Unlike Can't Hurt Me, David is now a well known motivational speak with millions of followers and fans. He is wealthy, he has prestige and a great reputation. And it was fascinating to see how he would react to this; well it wasn't inspiring at all. \n\nHe writes how he looked in the mirror and was terrified he was losing the \"savage\" that got him here, how being comfortable and living an easy life was scaring him because now he's no longer that warrior he wanted to see himself as. I do believe this \"savage\" mindset was necessary to escape poverty and no clear way to have a stable future. But now he doesn't need it anymore. Yet he talks about how he needs to conquer the weak man inside himself because Life will have no mercy; David you are running a marathon, you are voluntarily entering these extreme tasks. If you fail it only hurts your ego, it won't destroy your livelihood. Where Can't Hurt Me inspired i felt Never Finished was an ego stroke",

        "text": "This book was recommended to me in this forum, and I saw on Wikipedia that it's required reading at West Point, and so I was expecting and hoping for a real masterpiece.  Well; it is and it isn't.  It's unforgettable, I'm sure.\n\nIt's a fictional story of the life of an army hero who (as a teenager) feels like a \"man of destiny,\" joins the Army to fight in WWI and then stays in the army and goes up and down in the ranks through his career.  Lots of melodrama.  He displays his capacity for quick thinking and leadership in battle.  He meets a bewitching girl, and marries her.  He meets and interacts with an enormous variety of different people.  His leaders betray him, both anonymously and personally.  He betrays others, through no fault of his own (or perhaps, through understandable fault).\n\nI can imagine why it's required reading at West Point, if it really is.  There are two reasons:  first, it seems like a remarkably good view of what those who pass through that institution can expect their careers to look like, if they do well and stay in the Army.  West Point wants to be able to tell them they warned them:  your rank may be reduced through no fault of your own, you won't make a lot of money, your posts may be boring or even awful, and friends may be hard to find.  Second, it considers the deeper issues of war pretty thoroughly.  Is it pointless?  Hell yes.  Is it an amazing waste of (sometimes) very good people?  Hell yes twice.  Will your superior officers betray you, both anonymously and personally, and for their own personal glory or to hide their faults?  Hell yes again.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about it is how leftist much of it is, when it comes to war.  It starts out portraying Our Hero, Sam Damon, as a kind of Soviet Realism hero, a worker of the people, by the people and for the people - and courageous and strong too!  Manliness to burn.  But then it asks all these questions about what war is for, and doesn't answer any of them permanently or finally.  We do the best we can, it concludes (I think), and that's all we can do.\n\nIt didn't occur to me before I'd read it, but isn't the old style of war, the European style, where countries fight over zones of influence and who's going to make the rules about how the people live, really just a battle over who will profit from what is profitable in a country?  If so, then war is really a way of conning the poor into defending what the rich own, disguised as a way of life or national principles.  I'm sure this is not a new idea, but it's new to me.  Well, I'm young lol.\n\nAs I say, an unforgettable book - but I wouldn't call it a real masterpiece.  If those two purposes I listed above are the real reasons it's assigned at West Point, well done - it does the job.",

Repetition is also somewhat of an occurrence here.\n\nI couldn’t help feeling that he managed the structure of the book better in The Body as here, at times, he jumps around wildly from topic to topic on his way to coherence. In a chapter about the passage, a sort of hallway in this case, he reminisces about the Eiffel Tower, shortly remembers to mention the passage for one paragraph and goes on to expound on concrete, Thomas Edison and finally landing on the telephone (as in his domicile, an old rectory, the phone was located in the passage, thus serving as his thread of connection). After his recount of the history of the telephone he advances to its technical specifications and the personal lives of those around the invention and then quickly remarks on the standards of practice for its use in the past before finally moving on to luxury architecture for the super rich and the architects involved (by this point it feels like we’ve returned to this topic at least twice before in different chapters). Much of this could have been fixed by changing the chapter names to accompany this sort of free form writing. Although, even that wouldn’t fix the issue of some parts of the book being only tangentially connected to its topic.\n\nStill, the greatest achievement this book achieves is its capacity to give us context to this wonderful world we live in and are all too often too preoccupied to pay sufficient attention to. Bryson recounts to us this context through a plethora of interesting facts and lively anecdotes that can at times become truly gripping and always illustrate the point he is making.\n\nBryson’s resourcefulness in researching his books is always impressive and to read through one is to look at the world through the eyes of someone charmingly witty who genuinely wants to share his inspiring love of life.",

Hoping someone here might have read it too. \n\nIt’s a romance novel, I believe it was already an older novel when I got it, that takes place in the desert region of the US. The female love interest is a supermodel who returned to her hometown for a photo shoot. She was known as a plain looking girl, but when she gets dressed up and put on makeup she looks like her supermodel version. Her features go from lanky to elegant, but nobody from her hometown knows her this way, despite her being a high profile model. I am also pretty sure her aunt is the one who got her into modeling. \n\nAnyways she reunites with her longtime love, a man who runs a ranch and sells prize horses for a living, but he doesn’t know she is a model. This is concerning because he has a deep distrust for beautiful women due to his childhood. He’ll have flings with them but prefers to marry plain women like our protagonist. \n\nHis current fling/gf throws insults at her so much that the FL interest attends a big party for the horses in her supermodel look. While everyone at the party is captivated by her and she got to one up the fling, the ML interest is livid. He insults her and essentially says that all beautiful women can’t be trusted. They keep attempting to make it work but he can’t get over his distrust and doesn’t take the labor required for modeling seriously even after he stays with her for an out of town shoot and watches her work. \n\nThey break up and a while later they run into each other in the desert, his younger sister has come along and a poisonous snake is right in front of her. The FL interest jumps in front of his sister to protect her and when he sees this selfless act, he throws away his distrust and they get together again once and for all. \n\nBy the way he also calls her Niña. \n\n\nI hope somebody can find this title 😭",

        "text": "Recently came across a version of Legend of Tannhäuser from a collection of popular tales from the Norse and north German published in 1907. Starting from the skeleton of this story and draping the world of Chronicles of Narnia over it would explain what we get in The Silver Chair. Included is the ideas of enchantment and temptation of the green witch and her underground kingdom.\n\nAnyone pick up on this connection before? Are there other stories you have found that inspired larger narrative elements within Chronicles of Narnia books? Curiously, I do not see much reference to this interplay between The Silver Chair and Legend of Tannhäuser discussed elsewhere.\n\nIn the Legend of Tannhäuser the travels of a knight lead to invitation to competition at the court of Dame Venus. Who it is revealed lives in an underworld caverns below a mountain. She is described as giving friends the most exquisite pleasures earth can afford, both of silver and gold of abundance. Another is met along the way who claims for 300 years has been employed in warning those away from the temptations of the Venus Mount. He warns to stay away from the mountain lest the temptress entangle thee in her net. The knight travels to the court of Venus anyway. To have a look considering that if it looks amiss he can turn and leave before being ensnared.\n\n&gt; *As the mountain is approached discordant sounds resolve into harmony.* Through a door in the rock they could see knights, beautiful women, and dwarfs. All seemed to be enjoying themselves utmost. At the entrance sat a fair woman in royal robes. The moment she saw Tannhäuser she smiles, and signed to him to approach. Eckhard in the same moment entreated him by all he held sacred to *beware of the temptress, who was outwardly like an angel of light, but inwardly a fiend incarnate.* He would have said more, *but Venus interrupted him by beginning to sing a wondrous song about the joys that awaited those who entered her kingdom; and Tannhäuser, as thoroughly enchanted as though a magic spell had been cast over him, thrust Eckhard aside, and hastened to the queen of beauty, who stretched her arms out to him*. She half drew him over the threshold, and he half staggered across. Then the door shut, and the faithful Eckhard saw him no more.\n\nThe main point of the legend describes how every day brought new pleasures, which the knight enjoyed to the utmost. But at length began to tire of it, and confessed himself that satiety was not happiness. He had a horror of himself, and of the self-indulgent life he was leading; and his conscience, once awake, left him no peace. Rest of the story describes his effort to escape and return to his prior life in which all he had held important was put on hold.\n\nCore elements of The Silver Chair are all there. Adventure to the far north to seek out a mountain with entrance to the underground kingdom. The temptress witch using music and enchantment to ensnare. The witch turning into a snake is a visible depiction of the inward fiend incarnate. Time lost in those depths. The long road traveling back out of the underworld. The most vivid parts of The Silver Chair are those that map closest to Legend of Tannhäuser.\n\nInteresting story to stumble on. Raises questions what other sources in the cauldron of storytelling were used by CS Lewis to craft the larger works.",
