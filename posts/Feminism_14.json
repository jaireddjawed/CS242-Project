        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/10smi8h/help_feministnonmisogynistic_subs_and_resources/",
        "text": "Hello, I'm coming on this sub because I don't really know where else to post, I'm sorry if it is considered inappropriate here, in which case I'll remove it and would gladly accept any recommendation of a more accurate sub to post in. I came here because I badly need some sisterhood against patriarchy right now.\n\nEssentially I'm trying to build muscles, I don't have yet the budget to hit the gym or anything, so naturally I'm searching for advices etc on internet to guide me, but the problem is, bodybuilding/gym/muscles building online communities are like...super dupper uncomfortably misogynistic? At least the ones I found as a newbie not knowing where to go. The bodybuilding subreddit is plain awful and justify it by \"it's male locker room culture to sexualise, objectify and humiliate women just deal with it\", content with muscular women are spammed by aggressive manosphere/anti-feminist dudebros. I just found a video about historical weightlifting women today, which would have been cool and inspirational if it wasn't for the literal flood of comments about how they're still feminine and beautiful and fuckable by men unlike the \"disgusting man-like mass monsters\"/\"women transforming in men with steroids\" of nowadays (not that Victorianw thought any better of it, but somehow men criticise their Victorian counterpart for being sexist and not recognising these women or finding them attractive, while being the exact same using word for word the same insults) and all ignominious latent transphobia. It is really very discouraging for a woman starting to get into this, to have a very hostile community like that welcoming you.\n\nAnd like, this is a super concerning phenomenon that it happens imo, so I researched it, and it's like nobody talks about this misogyny and toxicity, and the women who talks about toxicity in gym... actually smash feminist women and fully embrace manosphere bs. Literally, I searched woth multiple keywords on YT and it's just people being pissy about feminists and muscular women and how men are oppressed by the nasty evil women who fight against sexism and how we shouldn't make gym feminist and not everything is about sexism and more #notallmen. So it makes me feel like I'm crazy when there are all of this obvious, objective misogyny and toxicity and yet nobody talks about them.\n\nI am feminist so of course I believe every women should be able to exercise in peace and look however they want. I'm also lesbian so it adds a very thick layer of yikes when I see all these comments, because I very much don't want to be rated on my fuckability by men, and in fact I'd thrive if I could just not interact with them at all and not be sexualised and judged by them when I'm reclaiming my body as mine. And it's also extremely disgusting to see how they talk about muscular women, masculine/\"man-like\"/gnc women challenging gender norms, because I think they are definitely super cool and badass (and yes, I happen to find them attractive, too, just I'm not sexualising them or objectifying them like men do and I'm more focused on how they worked out to achieve this. You know, like a normal person). I believe gyms etc shouldn't be (straight) men culture/sexist by default and make women uncomfortable and I'm also not a man and don't see why I should get validation points from them or find their toilet humour acceptable and not complain about them.\n\n\nAt this point, I'd give my imaginary first born to anyone able to provide me literally any crumb of info about a place to talk about gym/bodybuilding etc that is moderated against sexism, that is acknowledging misogyny. Just something when I can learn the basics without constant aggression would be nice for a start, even if that's demoralising to set the bar so low.\nAnd I especially would cry of joy if any good soul here could recommend any resources about feminist muscle building or any books/articles/videos/documentary/subreddit/blog talking about this damn huge issue so I don't feel like I'm crazy anymore for finding the obvious unacceptable. I want to see muscular women being aggressively feminist, please, that would do so much for my motivation. Maybe it's naive of me because sexism is everywhere, but I swear it's a toxicity anove the average level, like what you'd be exposed to going to a conservative incel meeting or some shit. I just wanted to train today, not lose neurones and mental health points to misogynists.\nAnyone helping out with that would have my most sincere thanks and love.",
