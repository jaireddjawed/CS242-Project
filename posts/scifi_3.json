        "text": "Mimicking the fibrous muscle around the face and neck in robotics is an interesting process to consider. One approach would be to use a series of interconnected actuators and sensors to simulate the complex movements of the facial and neck muscles. These actuators could be controlled by a trained neural network, which could analyze input from sensors to generate the appropriate movements.\n\nThe network would take input from sensors that measure muscle movements or other relevant signals, and use this information to generate commands for the robot's actuators. \n\nThese actuators should be thin bands of flexible materials, also be capable of producing both fast and slow movements, as well as movements in multiple directions. You would need many thousands (potentially 100k+) of interconnected actuators mapped and real-time synced to an electroactive polymer surface to work as a good early fabrication prototype. \n\nIn the image what looks like long strands of hair would instead be the thousands of individual actuator bands being mounted onto the facial chassis before calibration and final mapping sequence, etc. What other fabrication techniques and manufacturing processes could enhance something like this?",

        "text": "I am making a sci-fi themed RPG campaign, which lead me into a lot of sci-fi stuff. I have looked up, down, and all around at different sci fi concepts and have a few questions.\n\nThe main antagonist of this story is a robot who was built to make a dyson-sphere, but just a ring, not the whole sphere. When it was completed (I know this is already a stretch) he went rogue and started using the ring to extort planets with ransoms (sunlight increased, sunlight blocked, and some weather satellite effects once he was established enough to make those). He has a pathological fear of making backup copies and only does emergency transfers to other bodies. So to defeat him, the players will give him a virus to make his transfer protocol believe it is successful and have him delete himself; so they will have to fight him to make him start a transfer.\n\nMy main questions come in his weapons. I understand conventional guns and lasers are really cool and good, but I want him to be unique. I thought if he generated plasma and manipulated it magnetically using special appendages made for that, he could be a sort of plasma-bender, like a fire bender from avatar? I also don't want to over-complicate his design (his hand is a laser, gun, USB port, and blender!!! No, it's just a hand) so I want to try and stick to his general plasma theme. Should he also be able to shoot particle beams and use bragg's peak and everything as a method of attack?  \n\n\nThat's pretty much my question. Can he generate and magnetically manipulate plasma in an effective way, even if it's super short range (and I did look into toroidal plasmoids, I don't think I'll say those can be shot further than 90 ft for this since but maybe that's not even fair?), and is a particle beam sort of similar in 'theme' and something that's reasonable to give him.\n\nFor reference, he's a 9 ft tall humanoid robot; they will fight on his ring, so in space; and he has access to really whatever resources due to ransoms, nuclear transmutation, and access to the suns energy (though I don't know if he can access the energy fast enough to use it in a fight, so stick with the other stuff for how much energy he will need to be using). Are there better ideas for him to go with? Yes. Are they as fun? Maybe not.",

It is originally in german language, but you can turn on subtitles. I recommend it to every sci-fi fan and especially every sci-fi creator:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/W4q4uhPxQxQ\n\n1. Holograms \n3d holograms are useful when you have to display spatial stuff. It does not make sense to be used as a replacement for regular displays.\n\n2. Hexagonal Patterns\n\nYes, there are reasons for hexagonal bee-hive patterns in some cases. But it mostly seems like designers slap it on every surface, just to make it look futuristic with low effort.\n\n3. Generic numbers and letters\n\nAlso quite common scifi design clichee are alphanumerical combinations to be slapped on every wall, floor or object. In almost every case they do not make sense at all.\n\n4. Obtuse cut-off edges\n\nJust to fit the aesthetics of circuit boards, designers seem to hate 90 degrees angles and always cut them off. User interfaces, doors, and what not, always cut off edges.\n\n5. Caution tape patterns\n\nAs soon as it gets mechanical or warehousy, there is black and yellow lines everywhere. Just like the other clichees they do not make sense most of the time. They can be a neat little detail, but mostly they are just overused.\n- - - - -\n\nI really hope people stop using these too much. Even my most favourite sci-fi  shows do this.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

        "text": "As a lifelong sci-fi fan and graphic designer I always was bothered by the fact, that there are visual elements that are used inflationary in every tv-show and every video game in a futuristic setting.\n\nFinally I found a video that sums it all up pretty well. It is originally in german language, but you can turn on subtitles. I recommend it to every sci-fi fan and especially every sci-fi creator:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/W4q4uhPxQxQ\n\n1. Holograms \n3d holograms are useful when you have to display spatial stuff. It does not make sense to be used as a replacement for regular displays.\n\n2. Hexagonal Patterns\nYes, there are reasons for hexagonal bee-hive patterns in some cases. But it mostly seems like designers slap it on every surface, just to make it look futuristic with low effort.\n\n3. Generic numbers and letters\nAlso quite common scifi design clichee are alphanumerical combinations to be slapped on every wall, floor or object. In almost every case they do not make sense at all.\n\n4. Obtuse cut-off edges\nJust to fit the aesthetics of circuit boards, designers seem to hate 90 degrees angles and always cut them off. User interfaces, doors, and what not, always cut off edges.\n\n5. Caution tape patterns\nAs soon as it gets mechanical or warehousy, there is black and yellow lines everywhere. Just like the other clichees they do not make sense most of the time. They can be a neat little detail, but mostly they are just overused.\n\n- - - - -\n\nI really hope people stop using these too much. Even my most favourite sci-fi  shows do this.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",
