        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI've often wondered how different countries deal with the different requirements for infrastructure and the costs associated with it.\n\nFor example, I've moved to the Netherlands a couple of months ago. There is a lot of investment into awesome bike lanes, bridges, tunnels and all of that. Also the highway system and public transportation is pretty good. Plus, the country is basically sealed off by huuuuge dams and everything that comes with that, for example locks. So the infrastructure here is pretty good, even though the costs for all of it should be a lot higher than, lets say Germany, where nature and the geography of the country seems a lot \"easier\" to work with.\n\nHow do different countries do it? It feels like the Netherlands must invest crazy amounts into all of that, but it's not like people are paying insane amounts of taxes or that they are poorer because of it. Why does for example the United States struggle so much with building decent infrastructure? I know, it's a political decision that has to be made, but the reason its not is the costs.\n\nHappy to discuss this or read interesting news about it.",

        "text": "Cabin sprawl is becoming an issue in Norway. Last year we got [this article about cabin sprawl in the mountains](https://morgenbladet.no/aktuelt/2017/04/hytte-og-pine); this year a researcher at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences has [looked at cabin sprawl and found it's unsustainable](https://www.aftenposten.no/bolig/Dansk-forsker-tar-kraftig-oppgjor-med-den-norske-hyttekulturen--Det-kan-ikke-fortsette-slik-11792b.html).\n\nCabins used to be relatively rare and simple—the one I grew with access to had solar panels and some car batteries for reading light and a radio, an outhouse, and water in a creek nearby. To get to it we'd park our cars at a common lot and hike for 5 – 10 minutes to get to the cabin. There were other cabins in the area but not so many that you'd feel shy pissing behind a tree.\n\nThese days there are more cabins than ever, and they're often as well-equipped as any other villa, with indoor plumbing, electricity, big televisions, dishwashers, laundry machines, and you can drive all the way to the cabin. They're so close to each other that it might as well be a suburban development lot.\n\nSo in a time when the Norwegian government is working to densify towns and cities, there's another kind of sprawl happening in natural and very rural areas.\n\nIs this a common problem? Or are the Norwegians trailblazers—trailwreckers, maybe?",
