For a power source, I use an IR EC112 (up to 500RPM) and a Bluepoint AT810 (1500Rpm?) for hand work and a craftsman drill press (up to 2k rpm) for work in a vise.  \nto increase the longevity of my bits, I am curious from a materials engineer standpoint, how would i calculate the optimal feed rate/rpm for the bit in use?   \nhow do I measure the effectiveness of my lubricant/coolant? (how to tell when i need thicker or thinner fluid (or oil vs water based))  \nhow would i optimize the cutting angle of my bits when it comes time to sharpen? (are certain angles better for certain materials or hardnesses)  \nthank you for any input you all can give.",

On high speed it collected 204g of condensate per hour. So high speed is faster, but only by 6%.\n\nMeanwhile, power consumption was 184W on high speed and 179W on low speed, so 2% more consumption in high.\n\nBit more background info -\n\n**Experimental set up**: The hardest part of this test is ensuring consistent environmental conditions, since running the dehumidifier at different settings will affect the environment and hence the condensation rate in a self-feeding cycle. So the dehumidifier was placed in one of the largest spaces in the building (much larger than it was designed for) and left to stabilize for a day before the tank was emptied and measurements started.\n\nThe water tank was removed for weighing for each test, so at the start of each test the dehumidifier was running for 5 minutes without the compressor (since removing the tank makes it shut down and there’s a compressor restart time delay).\n\n**Environment**: building made of hollow concrete blocks and limestone. All windows closed. Nominally 60%RH and 23°C.\n\n**Equipment**: Dehumidifier rated for 11 litres per day at 80%RH, 32°C\n\n**Disclaimer**: These results are only valid for me using my dehumidifier in my house. Your results will vary due to differences in equipment, test types or conditions.\n\n**Conclusions**: You get marginally higher condensate collection rate and marginally better energy efficiency running on high if you use my dehumidifier under my environmental conditions.",

My basic design involves a horizontal length of 26 GA NiChrome wire heated to around 800F, that I can raise above the bed for thicker or thinner cuts.\n\nUsing a [calculator](https://jacobs-online.biz/calculators.htm) for resistance wire temperatures, it's my understanding I need 2.6-A to bring 26 GA NiChrome 80 wire up to 800F.\n\nAt 2.56 Ohms/ft, the total resistance of an 18-in wire would be 3.84 Ohms. \n\nAt 2.6-A and 3.84 Ohms the voltage required would be 10-V. (I'm assuming the resistance of the wires between the power supply and the NiChrome is negligible).\n\nI have a 12-V 3A [power supply](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-100-240V-Transformers-Converter-Connector/dp/B0B14PN9Z9/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=12v+5a+power+supply+with+switch&amp;qid=1670893749&amp;sprefix=12v+5a+power+supply+with+%2Caps%2C205&amp;sr=8-10) that also has a dimmer. I imagine, all things being perfect, I could dial in the dimmer/potentiometer to 10-V and everything would be hunky-dory. But what things weren't exactly dialed in? If I had the dimmer all the way on at 12-V, my 18\" NiChrome would both be too hot (like 950F), and more importantly my current would be 3.125A, correct? That would blow the power supply?\n\n**What would be the best and cheapest way to prevent that? Do I increase the length of the wire? Throw a resistor in series to ensure I have at least 4 Ohms of resistance so I'm under 3A at 12-V? Are 200 milliohm resistors even a thing? Or do I need to spend extra money on a 12V 5A power supply and separate dimmer?**\n\nFor what it's worth, I really only need to reach 600F to cut XPS foam, but every guide I've seen says to aim for 800F and use a dimmer to dial it down to whatever's best for your own circumstances.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI'm a 21 year old male, and I'm having somewhat of a deep quarter life crisis going on here. Currently, my GPA is a 2.4 ish in 3rd year Computer Engineering at a top 30 school. I've had to repeat 2nd year Engineering, and right now, I've just failed the 1st semester of 3rd year as well. \n\nMy life is at a junction here, and I've just realized, coding is not my thing. Debugging, labs, coding make me want to basically pull my hair out and punch a wall. In my first year, I got 61 in a programming course. It was my worst course in the entire first year. And I realize that I got saved by the pandemic since classes went online and we had 24 hr exams for this course. In second year, the first course I ever failed was in programming. It's what led to a downward spiral of me dropping courses. I'd basically drop courses since I was basically afraid I'd fail them. In each of my 3 programming courses, I've been stressed out (and I mean A LOT). \n\nSo obviously, the software engineering path is not for me. \n\nI love business, stocks, investment, analytics and math. I was pretty interested in doing economics in highschool, and have been learning it since 13. \n\nSo here are my options: \n\n1) Suck it up, and finish engineering. A then open a private business in teaching (I come from 3-4 generations of teachers). The upside is I can make 70-80,000$ a year by heavily marketing. I already have a website and underlying infrastructure ready. \n\nThe **downside** is that its a business, and you have no security. Also, 70-80,000 is low compared to other roles where you can grow your career. \n\n2) Finish engineering and somehow try to another engineering role like data engineering etc (not too enthusiastic about it). \n\n3) Switch degrees. I've spent 4 years in engineering. If I switch to a math &amp; economics major, I have to start from scratch and begin in fall 2023. So In other words, the last 4 years were for nothing, and I have 30,000+ $ debt to show for it. \n\nUpside is that I can concentrate, get a good GPA and focus on applying for roles like investment analyst, private equity analyst and investment banking. I could get a MBA. \n\nThe **downside** is that I'll only begin full time work as a 28 year old. \n\nIf I go with option 3, I work at 28. At option 1, I begin working at 23. That's 5 years worth of full time work (growing the business). \n\nMy goal is to save as much as possible, and begin investing in stocks to grow my net worth. If I make an annuity, and contribute 4000$ a month to my investment account for 30 years, and compound it at 15% per annum, It'd be about 20+ million dollars. \n\nThe only way people actually make money is saving their money from a well paying job/business, and investing it. The earlier you start, the better it is. \n\nwhat do I do :(",

I usually have to determine load cases for my designs, which can be a challenge but once I'm reasonably assured with what I'm designing for, I can design to a high safety factor and be confident in my work. \n\nOn the occasions that I can find codes or regulations surrounding my project, how should I handle safety factors? Ex. If a code says a bracket needs to be able to handle 15kN, does this include a safety factor (so to speak) or should I still design for a 3-5 safety factor (45-75kN)?",

Water meter probe was down the well with bailer (wrong, now I know), upon pulling bailer out of well, it got kinked/tied up with the water meter probe. Both bailer and probe are stuck ~3-4 feet from the top of the well (about even with ground surface as it is a stick up well). \n\nTried to fish out bailer with fishing hooks, they all bent. Screwed hooks into a paint rolling pole, got the top of the bailer hooked, and then the top came off. Body of the bailer is stuck in the well with water meter probe below it (probe broke off from the rest of the tape).  Going back out to the site this week to try and fish it out, any ideas on how this could be done?  I was pulling up on the bailer with probably close to 50 pounds of pressure and there was no movement, my team and I think it hit a seam in the wall of the well and got fully stuck. \n\nThe only idea I have as of right now is to cover a pole in some kind of adhesive and set it down into the body of the bailer, wait for it to dry, and try to pull it out. If that doesn’t work, knocking both the bailer and the probe to the bottom of the well seems to be my only option. Was hoping anyone else had a creative idea, thanks",

The speed of rotation is reasonably quick - around 120rpm, but the duty cycle is low - most of the time the component will be stationary while an optical system inspects the component at that angle.\n\nThe stiffness of the motor needs to be quite high, which can result in a high frequency oscillation if the part inertia is quite low. The component is coupled to the motor on one end, and a bearing block on the other. This bearing is where I would like to put some sort of damper for this system if it exists.\n\nMy research says that most rotary dampers are general for very low speeds and commercial low accuracy applications. I cannot find a ball bearing (or similar) with what is essentially high viscosity grease in the cage but maybe I am searching for the wrong thing.\n\nI have considered putting a planetary gearbox on the motor instead but space is limited so would prefer to avoid this if I can. \n\nAny thoughts on the above would be greatly appreciated.",

This assumes footing and foundation is sufficient where needed.\n\nIn order to avoid messing with the existing joists (1950s home - true 2x6). I just want to lay new top plates on the exterior walls and another across the center of the homes span (directly above the load bearing wall already exists in the first story) and lay new joists across. This also would enable me to take our 8 foot ceilings and remove the drywall (and existing insulation) to have exposed joists while still having a real flooring system above that. The illusion of taller ceilings and might prefer it aesthetically (we have good-looking old growth wood that should look nice exposed.\n\nThis also SEEMS more straightforward than removing the existing floor sistering the existing joists. Heck, we could act as the to plates are effectively walls and if they are a taller, it could be a spot to run utilities (HVAC, Plumbing, Electric) where necessary.\n\nBecause we'd be leaving the first story load bearing wall untouched, the load will transfer to the same place it's already built to go, right?\n\nThe space across the depth of the home (simple gamble roof running sideways) is 30 feet so only need joists to cover 15 feet.\n\nAny reason this wouldn't work?",

My question is, do yall think that I would get paid typical-ish process engineer salary as part of a rotation program, or do yall think the salary would be much lower until the rotations end? I've always had a hard time figuring out whether employees in a given rotation are \"full\" employees for that duration or just glorified interns.\n\nI've read a few places that rotation program salaries are hard to negotiate.

You can learn more about it [here](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/academics/undergraduates/senior-design-projects/past-senior-projects/2021-2022/flow-optimization). We decided to conduct a parametric study on four design parameters of ejector nozzles– inlet area ratio, exit area, mixing chamber length, and tab size. Because it would be expensive, time consuming, and risky to build nozzles to test on the actual engine, I devised a quasi blow-down wind tunnel which would accelerate compressed air through a system of ball valves, pressure regulators, and a settling chamber before entering cheap plastic 3-D printed nozzles at the same Mach number as the flow exiting the turbine on the actual engine. At the nozzle, I inserted static pressure ports at the secondary flow inlet to quantify the additional mass flow rate, and custom pitot probes fixed to an adjustable stand at the nozzle exit to get a sense of how well the flow was mixing inside the chamber, and to integrate over the exit’s cross-section to get an “average” total pressure at the exit. An Arduino Mega was used to process pressure data, and thermocouple data was recorded on LabView. I made a Matlab script to process the data for each nozzle, and modified the thrust equation to yield a thrust “value” for each nozzle we fixed to the end of my contraption.

        "text": "I (37m) recently received a new title at work of 'Applications Engineer'. I'm a long time CNC machinist and programmer that manages our CAD/CAM systems. I implement new processes and train folks on both our CAD and CAM platforms. I also write some scripts from time to time with Python, SQL, VBA, and Fanuc Macro B for task that we either want to simplify, automate, or just happens to be complex and would warrant it. I'm relatively proficient at CAD design, even have a product I helped a friend develop on the side which you can buy in Cabela's, Bass Pro Shops, and other big stores of that nature.\n\nThat being said, I personally asked for this specific title as it's a role in my industry (CNC Machine Tool Programming) that I want to further my career in. Essentially becoming a subject matter expert for a future company. However, some in my group feel that 'Engineer' in the job title is only for those who have degrees and it's a disservice to those who do have them. They also won't call the only person in our group an 'Engineer' because he's fresh out of school(with a BA in EE) and doesn't have the experience.\n\nSo, I want to pose a question to the community, where do you draw the line between Engineer and non-Engineers with regards to titles and duties? Do you make the distinct line for degree holders and non-degree holders?",

I took the cover off to get the electronic.\n\nIt's pretty simple: button + battery + chip + bright LED aimed at a fiber optics like material.\n\nI tried googling for this material as I'd like to use it in another project.  All my searches came up with fiber optics, which seem to be exclusively shaped in cable form.  I did see really cheap cabling with complaints that \"this isn't real fiber optics, just a plastic\" with the callout that you could see yellow a few inches past the LED.  Seems to be a similar situation here.\n\nThe key part for my project is that I would like to work with strips/ribbons, not cables/ropes.\n\nSorry for the bad centering, but I think its clear enough to show the type of material I'm look for.  Thanks so much for reading!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/uuS6d8U",
