So, in order to download the entire book you would have to download each chapter as a book. my question is if there is a way to download all the chapters as one book.\n\nit happens with some books though that while you are seeing the first page with all the hyperlinks to the chapters, and download it as epub, it downloads every chapter, without having to click on each one individually, but they are rare cases\n\nfor example in this case it downloads all the book: [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lost\\_Island](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lost_Island)\n\nbut not in this case: [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Organon\\_(Owen)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Organon_(Owen))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks",
