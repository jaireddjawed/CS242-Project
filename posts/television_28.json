How does it compare to something like Buffy?\n\n&gt;Teen Wolf is an American supernatural teen drama television series developed by Jeff Davis for MTV, loosely based on the 1985 film of the same name. Tyler Posey portrays a young werewolf who defends his California town from supernatural creatures and other threats.\n\n&gt;The series premiered on June 5, 2011, and concluded on September 24, 2017, after six seasons. It received generally positive reviews from critics and won three Saturn Awards for Best Youth-Oriented Television Series. The series also received thirteen Teen Choice Awards, nine for the performances of Posey, Dylan O'Brien, Tyler Hoechlin, Holland Roden, and Shelley Hennig, and four for Choice Summer TV Series. A film continuation, Teen Wolf: The Movie, was released on Paramount+ on January 26, 2023.",

I remember watching the show on an 18\" tube TV in my parent's exercise room as a kid. I later in high school bought the 2007 steelbook DVD for *Spawn* at a Circuit City, and I still have that DVD today.\n\nI just came across *Spawn* on HBO Max and it ignited the renewed interest I now have in it. I'm rewatching it, but it makes me wonder why HBO isn't taking advantage of a nostalgic comic book IP they own the rights to by making a Season 4 or a reboot of *Spawn*.\n\nThe comics are still ongoing today, after all, and there hasn't been *Spawn* media outside of comics since 1999.

        "text": "Before the show even begins, the same cycle repeats itself: announcements about casting legacy actors, a promise for a change to something more akin to actual 'Star Trek', vague, consternation-inducing trailers that tease fans with familiarity and nostalgia, the social media-driven public relations blitz that has articles posted everywhere about how emotional and moving this season of Picard will be, only for the show to be a floundering, poorly written mess made to appeal to people whose emotional ranges don't expand beyond \"I know that thing!\". \n\nThe teaser trailer for season two featured, for instance, a Bajoran relic, which one of the many PR Twitter accounts [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/TrekCore/status/1379263500858589184/photo/1). Unsurprisingly, it had nothing to do with the actual story, though perhaps it's for the best. After all, trying to describe what became of the story might [spoil your appetite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aPjpUJtbIA).\n\nI've now developed a working theory: Patrick Stewart and the rest of the original TNG cast being trotted out for season three of Alex Kurtzman's elaborate ponzi scheme are actually elaborately stuffed and mechanised mannequins. At some point during the final climactic episode where Picard and company are battling Amanda Plummer's morgage payments, the actual Patrick Stewart and cast are going to jump out from behind a wall and laugh at everyone for believing such a story was actually being presented.\n\n[Chuck Testa would have it no other way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJP1DphOWPs)",

        "text": "I started this show a week ago, running it in the background while i work or play on my phone. First 2 seasons were bearable, but after that, it's just ppl fucking and cheating all the time. And it's shown like it's love. I had to stop halfway through the 4th season. The show tries to be philosophical and deep and show the complexity of relationships when it's just ppl not being able to control their urges around their colleagues even when they're already sleeping with another colleague. I don't how this is still running after 19 years!\n\nAt this point in the 4th season, i don't know who's seriously in love with whom. Izzie cares about Alex &amp; George equally while she also can't forget dead Denny. Alex cares about Izzie and a patient. George is in love with every girl in the hospital except Cristina. Burke &amp; Cristina are shown to have differences and then they also get along just like that. Most of it is not clear why.\n\nMeredith and Derek are the only ones whose alliances are clear, but their relationship is shown to be complicated for no reason conceivable. They broke up abruptly now with no issues shown between them and everything was going well. Derek just mumbled some pseudo-deep shit and they broke up. The show just did that abruptly and immediately brought in a nurse.\n\nTwo gay relationships introduced in the same episode, one between doctors and one between patients (army guys) to get some brownie points from the lgbtq community.\n\nDoctors seem to do everything, even stuff that seems like a nurse's job. Malpractice is rampant amd without consequences. Derek &amp; Meredith did a clinical trial on a girl after the first 10 patients died in the trial and the chief explicitly forbid it. But Meredith blames the chief for her mother's troubles and he just lets the dangerous and illegally done trial pass. Of course the girl survives, so no consequences.",

But all non white nobles were Black.\n\nIn short I feel like the \"race blind\" casting only hired black people while removed central/east Asian who would've made sense being tribal/local leaders in Siberia, have relations with China /Japan etc.",

        "text": "Sure! Here's a brief summary of Game of Thrones recast as an 80s TV show:\n\nTitle: \"The Battle for the Iron Throne\"\n\nPremise: The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are in turmoil as several powerful families compete for control of the Iron Throne and the right to rule the land. The Starks, Lannisters, and Targaryens are just a few of the noble houses locked in a struggle for power and control. Along the way, they must also contend with supernatural threats from beyond the Wall and political maneuvering from the manipulative Tyrells and Baratheons.\n\nVisual Style: Think of a cross between the epic fantasy of \"The Lord of the Rings\" and the grandeur of 1980s soap operas like \"Dynasty\" or \"Dallas\". With its larger-than-life characters, stunning landscapes, and intricate political machinations, \"The Battle for the Iron Throne\" would have been a visual feast for 80s audiences.\n\nMusic: An orchestral score with a touch of synth and pop would set the tone for this larger-than-life fantasy adventure. Think John Williams meets Tangerine Dream and you're on the right track.\n\n\n\nSure! Here's a potential 80s TV Show cast for Game of Thrones:\n\nJon Snow (played by Sean Bean in GoT) becomes Jon Stone, played by Tom Selleck\n\nDaenerys Targaryen (played by Emilia Clarke in GoT) becomes Danni Taylor, played by Heather Locklear\n\nTyrion Lannister (played by Peter Dinklage in GoT) becomes Ty Reynolds, played by John Ritter\n\nArya Stark (played by Maisie Williams in GoT) becomes Aria Starr, played by Alyssa Milano\n\nSansa Stark (played by Sophie Turner in GoT) becomes Sandy Stark, played by Tracey Gold\n\nBran Stark (played by Isaac Hempstead Wright in GoT) becomes Brian Stark, played by Kirk Cameron\n\nBrienne of Tarth (played by Gwendoline Christie in GoT) becomes Bonnie Tarth, played by Lynda Carter\n\nTheon Greyjoy (played by Alfie Allen in GoT) becomes Thane Grey, played by David Hasselhoff\n\nJaime Lannister (played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in GoT) becomes Jake Lannister, played by Don Johnson\n\nCersei Lannister (played by Lena Headey in GoT) becomes Cindy Lannister, played by Jane Seymour.",
