        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI just thought I’d share this in case anyone wasn’t aware. For those that like going to gardens &amp; arboretums, you can save a significant amount by joining the American Horticultural Society. They have a reciprocal admissions program that includes a large amount of gardens across the US. To join with passes for two people, it’s $50 for the year (and gives access to all gardens in the reciprocal program while a member for free).\n\nGoogle “American Horticultural Society Reciprocal Admissions Program” (it doesn’t look like the group wants me to link directly - it’s the top result when searching).\n\nNote - some gardens state you must live some miles (50 or so) away in order to use the pass at their garden (aka, they want you to still pay for your local garden/arboretum). However, in practice, we haven’t had any gardens decline the pass regardless of how close we lived. I’m sure your mileage may vary with your local garden, but most are happy to have you. Also, be sure that the gardens you like to visit are on the list search &amp; click above. \n\nPro-tip: when joining, use your name for the first pass (let’s say Jane Smith). For the second, list the member name as ‘guest of’ your name (so, ‘guest of Jane Smith’). This way, the second/third/fourth pass might also be used for anyone visiting the garden with you rather than one specific other person. Oh, and you can gift memberships to other people.\n\nEnjoy! Happy New Year!\n\nP.S. I’m not in any way associated with AHS - I’ve just saved a fair amount using their program.",

        "text": "Some from the show and some from my own experience. Feel free to add on\n\n1. Cleaning with water and vinegar. I would still add baking soda and dish washing liquid to the list for a more powerful cleaner but we don’t necessarily need bleach or other cleaning agents though they are nice to have. \n2. Buying a bicycle for transportation. This might not be a good option for everyone especially if you live in an area that is hard to get around without a car but it will definitely save you money longterm if you don’t want to take the bus. My advice is to get a decent bike used for a few hundred dollars and initially yes it’s more expensive but in the long run you save a lot. I used to live where it would cost $1200 a year for the bus and I bought a $400 bicycle recently after moving so if I stayed there I could save $800. \n3. If you want to go to community college but don’t have the money try to find employment that can pay for your schooling. This one is hard because most jobs don’t pay for schooling but there’s a few that at least pay for community. My sister had a job that paid for her to get her bachelors because it was in the same field however she had to pay for community. It’s a better deal to not have to pay for a college that isn’t community as they are much more expensive. \n4. If you use a credit card get one with cash back and don’t spend more than 10% of your credit line. Pay it back when it’s due and not too early so your credit score can go up. Good credit scores are important for applying to apartments and getting a car.\n5. Look for sales when shopping. If you’re buying clothes get them thrifted. Groceries? Try going to get some things at Aldi (I don’t trust meats here so Trader Joe is also a good option cause they are cheaper and generally healthier than an average grocery store). Coupons help too. \n6. Growing your own food can help you not only avoid pesticides but also save money. Haven’t tried this yet but it sounds like a fun idea to garden. \n7. Find a cheaper phone plan. Mint mobile can be $15 a month for a single line 4 GB of data can work if you don’t use a lot of data. If you use more and want a better range of service t mobile connect works for $25 a month 6 GB. \n8. Cook more eat out less. Cost of food his risen significantly and making your own food can help make things cheaper for you.",

        "text": "I don't really like the taste of Greek yogurt on its own, but I love it when mixed with berries. The frozen berries keep for a long time.\n\nGreek yogurt has healthy probiotics that can help balance the gut flora and prevent some depressive symptoms. It also has a significant amount of protein per serving.\n\nI love to eat fruit, so I was looking for cheaper ways to consume large amounts of fruit, which led to me buying a bulk bag of frozen blueberries to munch on during the day.\n\nThen, I also love yogurt cups, but I find them expensive and a bit wasteful, so I decided to buy the yogurt in bulk, too. Greek yogurt lasts a little longer in the fridge than regular yogurt due to the probiotic bacteria in it.\n\nThe frozen yogurt bowls I make are healthier and cheaper than candy, yet they satisfy a similar craving. The frozen berries freeze the yogurt as I mix it up with the spoon, and then I basically blackout and it's gone.\n\nAlso, purple and blue fruits have high amounts of antioxidants, which always seem to reduce my anxiety. I look for sales on black grapes, blueberries, blackberries, pomegranates, and cranberries.\n\nA healthy lifestyle now can prevent medical bills from piling up later.",

        "text": "I did the math.  The card pays for itself and then some.  If you are mid-high income, like to travel, but also super cheap like me, check it out.  Every month there are new offers where you get things for 50% off.  So far I'm making money on this deal and I'm only four months in.  I had the card 20 years ago when I was trying to prove something, now I have it because I'm trying to save something.  Good deal.  \n\n\nI think we got 100,000 points as a sign on bonus and that translates directly 1:1 into miles for your favorite airline.  So that's roughly two free round trip tickets (three if you don't go far).\n\nJust as an example, the airport lounge access with free alcohol at airport prices,  you're 'making' about $50 a visit.  We typically go to the lounge before we catch our flight or on a layover and get free espresso drinks ($5 each) and free beer/wine/mixed drinks ($15 each).\n\nThis month there was an offer for $50 off $100 worth of wine at [maycs.com](https://maycs.com).  Who even know maycs had wine? But it shipped for free and I checked all the wines on Vivino before I chose them.\n\nMany more examples.  The only trick to the card is it takes a little work because you have to opt in for these deals, but if you just set a reminder to go to the offer page each month and pick up the offers you like, you're saving money on things you would buy anyway.  Not for everyone but figured I would share it here for those who could benefit.",

        "text": "With the news that Netflix won't allow users to share passwords anymore starting next year, which means their multiple-screen policy is turning to garbage, many (in this sub as well) have spoken about switching to other services, downloading their shows and movies, or leaving all streaming services altogether. I'm not going to suggest unsubscribing from Netflix completely (although it's also a reasonable option, more about it later), but I'd like to open a discussion about (legal) practical alternatives for paying the total price. Namely, split subscription services that offer cheaper plans for a \"\"share\"\" of a streaming service account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm talking about services like the LSC Split Community, based in India or other countries, who let users find cheaper alternatives to stream from their homes. There, you can get the equivalent of a third of a Netflix subscription (weirdly worded, but that's what it is) for $5 for the highest 4K option, which means you don't have to be the one paying for a whole subscription your family and friends use, and you also don't have to leech on others! (been on both sides, I don't know which one feels worse).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, I'm not sure the mods in this sub allow this kind of absolutely ILLEGAL and CRIMINAL talk, and I think those who want to watch any movie or show at any time already use this method without me telling them to, so I won't even mention it... Still, for those who live in countries where it's not illegal to access media for free, or VPN enjoyers, this tried and tested method is thriving, so I certainly don't judge people who are trying to get free stuff online.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, are split subscriptions a good last resort to keep paying for a Netflix subscription without getting absolutely rinsed next year? Or are less legal options preferable for you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Will you guys keep your Netflix subscription after the new rules, or just drop it entirely and look for alternatives? Would a split subscription service work for you?",
