        "text": "Vulture Sam has finally turned his life around. After taking the lives and bounties of several other bandits, not to mention their gear, he could finally see how one fewer outlaw could make the country side a better place (much less 4). After his band killed the last Sheriff and shared the loot, the raiding just didn't seem right or challenging. So he did what any retired outlaw would do who still had an urge for violence would do, he became deputized by the new Sheriff. Now he wasn't just killing bandits, outlaws, and renegades for profit, but to make sure his homestead stayed safe (and if the Sheriff doesn't know that they had a brand new Remington with a nice scope instead of the old, rusty Widow Maker that looks an awful lot like the one he was carrying a week ago, the more power to him) and be able to show his face in town.\n\nHowever, as a new Sheriff makes their face seen and name heard, there always comes a new group of outlaws trying to make a profit or name for themselves. But now Sam isn't trying to gain anything, he just wants to live a quiet life and help those he has previously terrorized. So he saddles up and heads out into the hills to meet these miscreants and to protect this new Sheriff with intoxication and initiative larger than her own life.\n\nCalling it a bloodbath would have been generous, it was more of an assassination by sledgehammer. The Sheriff was more worried about keeping healthy and drunk than firing a single shot, while the other deputy and Sam were trying to pick off the wounded bandits in order to swing the fight ever so slightly in their favor, but it was not to be as the Law couldn't manage to put down a single one of the oncoming criminals. One such example was the face off between Vulture Sam and Jourdonnais.\n\nJourdonnais was sitting uncomfortably in a jail cell, not able to do anything but listen to the fight raging outside as the Sheriff and Deputies were losing ground. As Sam's bribe money ran out (a trick he learned as an outlaw), the Warden was forced to release Jourdonnais and give him back all of his gear. Then, by the only stoke of good luck Sam saw that day, Jourdonnais walked right into a lit piece of dynamite that was quickly discarded by another bandit like some game of lethal hot potato and hit him hard with most of the blast. Jourdonnais, wasn't going to let a pesky explosive keep him down and started crawling to his feet were Vulture Sam came upon what he thought was easy prey to peck apart. Vulture fired a shot at Jourdonnais, but he threw his hat at The Vulture and missed. No matter, he had the [Volcano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Repeating_Arms) revolver in hand and full chamber so he fired two more times. Both of those shots were ignored as Jourdonnais was squatting behind a barrel. Vulture goes for a fourth shot but the gun jams, the more moving parts the more there is likely to go wrong, so he holsters it and brings out his second best weapon: his own fists.\n\nJourdonnais, still shocked by the explosion he just walked into couldn't find his bearings enough to fight back, but he sure could dodge. After some grabbing, throwing, and two large punches that did nothing but tire out Vulture, Jourdonnais was still alive. By this time Vulture was exhausted, his gun worthless, and now a collection of citizens gathering to see what all the commotion was. A different time back when he had to hide his face in town and the name Vulture meant you would be killed, stripped, and left out in the desert as a feast for his brethren and this would have ended differently. A quick execution would be fine for Vulture the Outlaw to keep the townsmen quiet and scared, but Sam the Deputy had to play by different rules. Sam had to uphold law, so Sam did the first right thing in a long time and simply threw Jourdonnais back into jail.",

        "text": "This is a long one, so if you want to get straight to the daemon fight, it's in the comments. \n\n[The first time the party encountered Abaddon's daemons can be found here, with some backstory.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2cv9gn/pathfinder_dragonslayers_and_revolutionaries/)\n\n[The venedaemon fight that changed the course of the campaign can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2i2omm/speedrun_a_six_session_storyline_shortcircuited/)\n\nIn this world, things like daemonic incursions aren't normal events. Sure there are summoners and conjurers and divine magic, but those are short lived and controlled. An actual celestial or infernal creature walking the material plane is a good indication that there is something big and probably not good happening. \n\nThe surviving party members have encountered daemons, the servants of the Four Horsemen, twice before. This is the story of the third encounter. \n\n\n---\n\nAfter the battle with the [venedaemon](http://paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9239-Venedaemon.jpg), a spellcasting infernal that just about leveled town square, the party fractured. Diowick the cavalier was dead, and Arthos the cleric and Alagia the ranger were tired of fighting the forces of Abaddon and returned to the hidden elf colony they'd helped establish. \n\nThis left Xavril, the trans-elf* arcanist, and Arradon, the half-elf investigator to their own devices, and after looting the daemon and recovering the Book of the Damned that Diowick had been carrying, they got as far from the spectacle as possible. It was three in the morning, they were tired, injured, and they'd just been abandoned by their friends. \n\nEnter Cedric and Whiskey. \n\nCedric and Whiskey were disreputable men. Cedric was a human psionic with a knack for telepathy, and Whiskey was a young elf pickpocket who'd picked up a bit of arcane magic along the way. They'd been hired to look into rumors of cult activity in this backwater town, and damned if they hadn't found some. They'd got to the site of the daemon attack just as the guards were showing up, and followed Xavril and Arradon discreetly to an inn before attempting to strike up a conversation. \n\nArradon just wanted to sleep, Xavril wanted to find Arthos before he was gone for good. They agreed to answer Cedric and Whiskey's questions, if they'd just give them a couple of hours downtime. It seemed reasonable, so of course Cedric disguised himself and followed Xavril, while Whiskey disguised himself and hunkered down in the bar of the inn Arradon was staying in. \n\nOut in the streets people were running around, screaming, and trying to put out the blaze that was consuming the mayor's manor along with most of the hard evidence of the mayor's involvement in the Apocalypse cult. \n\nOut in the woods, Xavril manages to track down Arthos and the two exchange goodbyes. Arthos tells Xavril that he's convinced the Evil Book will destroy them all, but Xavril is confident in his resolve. They part as uneasy friends, and Xavril burns the body of Diowick (as well as the scrolls he looted from the Venedaemon, once he determines they're scribed on humanoid skin). Noticing a disguised Cedric watching him, he returns to town with the psionic and they rejoin with Arradon and Whiskey in the tavern. It is now five in the morning and no one but Arradon has slept. \n\nSeveral hours of light interrogation later, and everyone is up to speed. There is a cult or cults dedicated to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse entrenched in the upper echelon of society, and even the Inquisition seems unaware of it. People have died, daemons have been summoned, and something big is going on, but no one is entirely sure what. \n\nCedric and Whiskey offer to put Xavril and Arradon in touch with their employer back in Ironport, an information broker who may have more details. The adventurers agree, and the four of them charter a riverboat South to the capitol city. Unbeknownst to all, one of Whiskey's friends has been following him quietly for weeks, disguised as an old woman. She too buys passage on the ship. \n\nOnce on the ship, Arradon and Xavril call their only contact in Ironport, the former governor of a colony that was overrun by lizardfolk. He informs them that the government has, for a variety of reasons that are mostly the party's fault, sent something like three thousand warforged to the Southern jungle island the campaign started to retaliate against the lizardfolk. But that much military hardware so close to another populate continent is likely to make the nearby nations twitchy, and the old governor predicts this is a plot by War cultists to, well, start a war. \n\nMeanwhile, Cedric has located a horse within earshot of this conversation, and has quietly hijacked its ears to eavesdrop on this conversation. \n\nThe governor mentions he hired an information broker to look into cults...who in turn hired Cedric and Whiskey. In effect, everyone on this boat has been working together for weeks, and never knew it. \n\nIt's about this time that Whiskey's friend gets tired of hiding quietly and...stripper dances across the deck of the ship (still disguised as an old woman), casts enthrall on the crew, pulls a flower out from behind Whiskey's ear, and introduces herself as Nix. Arradon is smitten immediately, and asks her to autograph his formula book. \n\n*Dm note: this whole process took two fucking sessions.*\n\nSo the new party is together at last. Where once there were righteous freedom fighters and stalwart opponents of evil, now there are a bunch of shady characters with a serious disguise habit, and they're all casters. The party now consists of an Arcanist, a Wilder, an Investigator, a Cleric, and an Arcane Trickster. Finally, we can get back to the story. \n\nI promised you a daemon, didn't I?\n\n*Xavril was a half-elf until he gambled half his heritage with a fey god, detailed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/2e78kp/tell_us_about_your_game_58_back_in_town_edition/cjwpwlq)",

        "text": "Backstory: Playing a mostly evil and neutral party, led by an inexperienced DM who made the horrible mistake of giving us much, much higher of a point buy than we should have had.\nI was playing Grug, a full-orc barbarian, with a strength so high you'd get a nosebleed just looking at the number. Grug's mental stats were... deficient, to say the least.\nThere were others, too, whose names all escape me now. The only thing I remember about the rest of the party is that we had a rogue who was the one neutral character trying to take dangled plot points. The rest of us were quite content to smash our way across the countryside. I had thrown my feat(s) into throw anything, and maybe something related to grappling. We also agreed that, training, rules, or not, a high roll is going to get you good results.\n\n(Despite the lack of remembering what the rest of the party was or did, I assure you, Grug's tales are more about him than the rest of the party. He was a one-man wrecking crew, and the rest of the party was along for the ride.)\n\nGrug and friends had been barely-convinced that there was a greater good (or perhaps, a reward great enough to convince us to /do/ good) in a nearby crypt. You see, there were rumors of necromancy afoot. The poor townsfolk were at least as afraid of some ne'er-do-well coming into town and raising their deceased grandmothers as they were of Grug and his nefarious-looking fellows, so they must have sent us off in the hopes that one evil would cancel out another.\n\nWe made our way through the crypt, fighting a few skeletons and the occasional zombie. Nothing too serious, even for adventurers at perhaps level 2. But that changed when we entered an unnaturally-cold room, one that housed a crypt of grave (hah) importance.\n\nThe main coffin in the room rose up, and revealed a long-dead figure, holding a curious metal helm and sword. It chucked the helm forward, as if expecting us to inspect it. Grug caught the helmet and looked at it. He then made to put on the helmet that he figured was a gift. Much to his dismay, though, the lich-like figure used magic to tug it from Grug's grasp, and place it upon his own head!\n\nGrug was very displeased that this bad man took Grug's new hat away. The bad man had to die, obviously. So we enter combat, and Grug rushes up to the Bad Man. The rest of the party is reacting to skeletons rising from the various other coffins in the room, ready to rock.\n\nOn Grug's first turn, he makes a strength check to grab the helmet, and squeeze. He gets a natural 20. The head of the lich, or whatever it turned out to have been, caves in, and it goes limp to the ground, defeated before it could get off a single spell. We quickly dispatched the mooks in the room, and Grug battered the helmet roughly back into shape with a rock and proudly wore it from then on.\n\nIf you're interested, there's also the story of the Hobgoblin's Hunting Trip Gone Awry, and Goblin Grabbin'.",

        "text": "We’re putting our normal Numenera campaign on a bit of a hiatus until the New Year, and I’ve introduced my players to Savage Worlds and the setting Tour of Darkness, a Weird War setting set in Vietnam during the war. We created characters and I thrust them into the first mission into the jungles. Our players are:\n\nAndrew D. as Pvt. Nelson Vaughn, the medic/radioman  \nNate L. as Pvt. Huey O’Reilly, the machine gunner  \nJoe U. as Pvt. John Winchester, the marksman  \nAdam T. as Pvt. Joseph Butters, the grenadier  \n\nWe also have a complement of NPC Extras, one for each player:  \nSgt. Frank “The Tank” LeBlanc, squad leader  \nCpl. Colin “Swaggs” Skaggs, the rifleman  \nCpl. Zander Daigle, the pointman  \nPvt. Jeremy “Pothead” Pruett, the assistant gunner  \n\nThe squad is all member of the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), and had been stationed in Vietnam since July. It was now August, and they hadn’t seen much action besides patrols and watch duty at base. But that all changed today. A team of special forces called in, looking for urgent support, stating they were being chased down by a platoon-sized force of NVA, and needed immediate back-up. The squad picked up their ammo and some extra water, and mounted up on their tracks to head out and save the snake eaters. They were also ‘given’ a B-52 that could provide support if they needed it, support in the guise of hundreds of pounds of bombs.\n\nReaching the DMZ, the group had to disembark from their M113s and head on on foot. The group readied themselves for the trek ahead. The first obstacle came an hour in, they came across a river that needed to be waded across. As John provided overwatch with his sniper rifle, the group waded over. The rest of the squad watched his back as the sniper crossed.\n\nThe next stop was when Zander spotted a blood trail leading off into the underbrush. John and Zander examined the trail and Sarge decided to follow it, but not for too long. It brought them to a small encampment with a half-dozen scattered AKs, a campfire recently put out, and some bags of rice. The squad sliced open the rice bags and dumped them, and headed back onto the trail of the special forces.\n\nAn hour later, Zander held up his fist. There was motion in the trees ahead, approaching the group. Huey panicked, thinking that the VC were attacking from above, and opened fire into the treetops. He succeeded in killing one monkey, and the squad ridiculed him for this. Sarge hollered that they’d wasted enough time and needed to get a move on. They crossed another river using the same tactics as before, and were making good time.\n\nZander held up his fist again, and motioned to a spot a few yards away. There was a small patrol of NVA soldiers carrying AKs moving parallel to the group. There was some debate on whether or not to hide and let them pass, but it was decided to take them. Nelson knew Vietnamese, so he shouted to the NVA soldiers demanding them to surrender because they were surrounded. Sarge compounded this by shooting one soldier’s hat off. Joseph opened fire with his M79 grenade launcher, and the trees vibrated with the sound of his attack. When the dust cleared, all the NVA were incapacitated except one, who was trying to surrender. Joseph, being bloodthirsty, did not want to take prisoners, but Sarge demanded it. Since Nelson could speak his language, he was assigned to babysit the prisoner, whose name was Vu Dao.\n\nThe group got back on the trail and kept heading on, only to find more disturbances in the bushes. All of the squad except Huey, Pothead, and Swaggs hid. Out of the bushes came four monkeys, walking upright towards the three men. Huey noticed that something was not right, the monkey’s eyes seemed to be an unnatural reddish. Nelson noticed this and whispered a warning to Sarge, who opened fire, capping one monkey right in the head.\n\nThe firefight began as everyone, slightly confused, opened fire on the monkeys. Joseph ran into the clearing to punch one of the little tricksters, sending it flying back into a tree, screeching in anger. It was shot by Zander, and stabbed by Swaggs, killing it. The other two attacked Huey, but couldn’t claw through his flak jacket. He cleaved one in half with his machete. Pothead almost shot Huey as he tried to help out, blaming the fact he was almost certainly high right now, and caused some inter-squad drama. Another monkey leapt atop Pothead, clawing at his throat, but John shot it off.\n\nThe bodies of four dead monkeys lay in the trail, and Sarge shook his head, complaining that they were wasting too much time killing monkeys. The squad agreed, and doubled the pace, though only Sarge, Swaggs and Pothead started to draw ahead. The squad eventually caught up to them hiding behind a log, scoping out a startling stone temple. There was a blood trail inside, and was the last coordinates of the special forces team. John crawled inside, and found six mangled bodies of the special forces operators.\n\nOne was still alive, and called for help. Nelson hurried over and managed to patch the man up enough so that he could walk. The soldier pointed them out to a locked briefcase near an empty altar, and said they needed to get it to HQ. He also begged them to call in an airstrike and make the temple ‘disappear’. While Sarge helped carry the injured man, Huey took pictures of the temple, the bodies, and the wound marks. Nelson called in the B-52 and told them to level the area.\n\nThe squad bugged out before the bombs started coming down. They double-backed down the trail they took to get there, and Huey stopped to take pictures of the corpses of the enraged monkeys from earlier. As the squad reached the last leg of the journey, crossing that first river back into friendly territory, Huey sensed something was amiss. He opened fire on the bushes at the other side of the river, just as someone fired back. It was to be an ambush. The NVA machine gunners were spooked though, and two fled.\n\nJoseph opened fire with his M79, landing a shot right into the machine gun nest. He was rewarded with an explosion, and a human arm wheeling through the air. Another man, horribly bloodied, fled the scene. The squad waited until they were sure it was clear, and started across the river. Sarge sent John and Swaggs ahead to track down the three escaped NVA.\n\nThey found the first one behind a tree hiding. John, using his bloodthirsty hindrance to good effect, slit his throat. Swaggs looked away for plausible deniability. They caught the second man limping away, trying to escape. John dropped to a knee and shot him right in the back of the head. This didn’t sit well with Swaggs, who needed to stop and vomit for a bit. The rest of the squad only saw the aftermath and the somewhat scrambled Swaggs. John never caught the third escapee.\n\nThe squad regrouped and headed back to the M113s, riding back to base without any disturbances. Nelson brought the wounded special forces soldier to the medical tent, and the squad turned in the briefcase and Huey’s pictures to HQ. They also recommended Nelson for a citation and the Lieutenant started the paperwork. Joseph, Nelson, and John all received promotions to rank Private (PV2).",

The party have a map, have some magic items, have discovered a \"back door\" through the river Styx. The party will travel to [Ranais, The Funereal World](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2iujxk/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_five_dd_35e_e6/) and through a mausoleum they will travel to a demi-plane of gloom from which they can journey down the river Styx and enter Hades somewhere less than a days walk to the Fleshslough.  \n  \nThe party trudge through the dead world, the wraiths that haunted them are nowhere to be found and the whole place is eerily silent, the sort of silence that exists on a planet where nothing lives. A silence that creates a sort of pressure on the listeners.  \nThe party find a crumbling Mausoleum, next to a ruined church, stained glass is scattered over the floor about the windows, ruined gargoyles hang from the rooftops and rotten wood lay about in unrecognisable heaps. The Mausoleum is still standing strong, intact and large ornate metal doors block the party from entering. Norril, Cleric of Olidammara and registered thief steps forward to attempt to unlock the door. His thieves tools trigger a trap and we roll initiative.  \n***Mausoleum Encounter!***  \nThe Party fights off the crumbling-yet-animated gargoyles, Norril fails a check hard and thinks if he disengages from this lock a trap will kill him.  \nSo Norril is in a skill challenge, He needs four successful lockpicking checks, four failures will break the lock. The catch to this is every round he's making trapfinding checks as the door attacks him from various traps. Taking damage makes his lockpicking harder (gives him a penalty to the check).  \nThe gargoyles are programmed to attack the lockpicker. So the party is trying to stop the gargoyles kill/maim Norril, playing defense.  \n  \nThe fight goes reasonably well for the party, they are fighting gargoyles 1-on-1, they are tough but don't deal too much damage. Norril gets on alright with the door, he dodges some darts, the door almost spikes him in the eye, but some floor needles catch him off guard and he fails a lockpick check, then a gargoyle manages to barge into him... the party kill it, Norril regains composure and unlocks the door. The last gargoyle crumbles, the magic no longer sustaining it. As the door opens and the party relax...acid falls on Norril catching him off guard. Fortinbras, the Favored Soul of Bahamut has been throwing heals Norril's way though and the worst of the damage is forgotten. The party clamber inside and look at the riddle etched into the wall ahead of them.  \n*I forge bonds with strength of hardest steel,*  \n*And place kings upon their thrones.*  \n*You wil find me on the battlefied,*  \n*And in the heart of every soul.*  \n[Answer:](/s Blood)   \nThe Paladin Kurask, who follows Bahamut and rides a Drakkensteed, steps forward, nicks his finger and presses a droplet of blood against the wall. The party are unceremoniously dragged to ~~hell~~ a small demiplane of gloom.  \n  \nFinding themselves in a dank forest the party follow a worn path, the trees around them are all dead, ash falls from the sky and covers the ground like fresh snow. The sky is a deep red and everything feels muted, duller.  \nThe party are ambushed on the trail by three... [Creatures with black holes for faces and squirming faces underneath their clay-like skin... Gloom Golems.](http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y90/Leviathans/Mors/Undead/82998.jpg)  \nThe party manage to subdue the monstrosities however Norril and Kurask take some charisma drain from the nightmarish attacks. Kurask's aura stops most of the despair though. Roku, the mineral warrior crusader of Bahamut, elects to take their heads back as trophies... the heads of the golems at this point is a mostly collapsed liquid mush. He tries to cut it off and gives up.  \nThe party continue on the path until they find a small brook. Realising this is probably the river styx they avoid the water... and even if it isn't ew, gloomwater.  \nThe party follow the stream until they find a dock. A sign asks them to ring the bell for the boatman. There is a piece of rotted string but no bell in sight. Kurask and Fortinbras decide to clang metal, helmets and breastplates. Baha Abdur, Pelor worshipping duskblade ex-mercenary and Azrael, Sorcerer Extrodinaire who is yet to succeed a will save, decide that a ghost sound of a bell would suffice. Either way the boatman eventually shows up, though the group aren't sure why exactly he came, The theory that 'a bunch of idiots making as much noise as possible was something he might want to come check out and see if the wildlife would eat them' was popular.  \nHe stood at the dock and waited. The party remembered to pay the boatman, two gold coins each. Norril thought about trying to give the boatman his coin of returning, but common sense prevailed when I asked him \"Do you really want to give what you believe is most likely the eternal boatman Charon, returning currency whilst he executes his duties?\" and he paid up the 2gp.  \n  \n**Session 15**  \n\nThe party arrive in Hades a few hours later, depart the boat and begin the walk to the Fleshslough.  \nA few hours into the walk the party is approached by a travelling caravan. Three mature women on horseback, dressed in noble garb, riding bareback, followed by six large men dressed in stretched noble's garb and three giant men dressed similarly, dragging along a large wagon. The party decide that diplomacy may be a solid option here and open a dialogue with the group. They end up trading some Larvae Baha Abdur found in Baator for information regarding the fleshslough's walls. The women tell the group not to try and burrow or fly around it, but simply to pass through, as the wall is trapped with deadly diseases. The group departs and then a few minutes later Fortinbras realises that was likely a Coven of Hags under a veil and had they attacked... they would likely be much worse for wear. General agreement that Damn Hades You Scary, and the party continue on.  \n  \nThe Party reach the walls of the Fleshslough, they walk around, trying to find an entrance but it doesn't seem like there is one. The party decide to walk into the wall, which has a texture like quicksand. This starts another skills challenge, Roku who has a burrow speed is exempt and passes through with ease, Azrael teleports through and passes a fortitude save to avoid terrible terrible diseases. Everyone else emerges on the other side, although Norril does need a little bit of help being pulled through before he suffocates...  \n  \nThe party look at the inside of the Fleshslough and the scene before them isn't exactly pleasant.  \nThe fields of growth lay ahead, and horrid pustules large enough to house men, giants and buildings lay here, they rise and fall as though grown on a giant’s chest as it breathes. Inside the pustules are shadows, amid the growths are tendrils that grow from the ground, coated in slime, creating a disgusting, fetid jungle. The smell is overwhelming. They manage to navigate the fetid field without breaking any pustules or getting covered in slime.  \n  \nAs they emerge from all that they enter a large courtyard, ahead of them though mostly shrouded in mist lay a huge temple/palace/fortress type structure. However that was beyond the truly massive courtyard they now stood at the edge of, and within the courtyard lay thousands of blocks of ice, with figures frozen inside. The party begin to scope out the icicles and check to see if they can find Azimov without touching the ice. The party spend hours looking before they find the centre of the court, and there lay an ice block especially for them, in pride of place; Asimov. He was emaciated, a tortured look on his face and contorted to a sort of defensive fetal position frozen in the ice. A large Yugoloth, a [Corrupter of Fate Assassin](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091115145459/forgottenrealms/images/2/27/Yugoloth-corruptor_of_fate.jpg) circled him and stared at the party, daring them to act.  \n  \nInitiative is rolled and the party gets to learn about disadvantage, the Corrupter of Fate's aura forces them to roll twice for attacks and damage, and take the worst result. Meanwhile he introduces them to sneak attacks and assassin spells. His invisibility is foiled when Kurask scoops up some ash from the ground with his shield and throws a cloud of it at the area the Corrupter vanished from. The Corrupter then uses obscuring mists to keep mobile whilst the party try to surround it. Eventually Baha Abdur catches it with a huge shocking grasp and the creature surrenders, telling them they succeeded his masters test, and he can tell them how to free Asimov.  \nHe talks about how they destroyed Dreggrot, who was Yurtrus's pawn that was intended to be used to retrieve the Wand of Orcus for him. Now he has Asimov in return but he grows bored of torturing him. If the party retrieve the Wand of Orcus then they can smash the ice around Asimov with it and free him. Otherwise they will never manage to free Asimov from the prison of Stygian Ice that Yurtrus himself created.  \n  \nThe party consider it and the Corrupter of Fate tells them they are free to leave. As they do they notice a dozen or so smaller corrupters' of fate watching from behind icicle prisons. The party are able to leave easily and leave Hades through the portal to Hopeless, Gatetown to Hades. From there they get back to Sigil quick enough and Fortinbras goes to the guild of the great wyrm, to tell the scribes about the inside of the Fleshslough, a place they knew nothing about until now.  \nThe rest of the party talk about the offer, not wanting to give an evil deity an evil artifact, but also not willing to let Asimov be trapped in Hades forever.  \n  \n[Next Part](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2nh2jp/game_tale_saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_eight_35e/)",

        "text": "Hi all! I'm back again with another installment of my ongoing **Call of Cthulhu** campaign, *Tatters of the King*. If you've missed them as they were posted to /r/gametales, previous entries can be found [here](http://www.yog-sothoth.com/blog/447-mr-bill-presents-tatters-of-the-king/), and should catch you up on the major players and what they've been up to so far. Regardless, player characters' names are **bolded** the first time they're used, for the reader's convenience.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nAfter a helpful tip at the police station, the group was off to the Ames Funeral Home, the funeral parlor that had handled the bodies after the Roby murders. Inside an old but well-kept white house, they were greeted by Mr. Ames himself. The mortician remembered the affair well: making the bodies suitable for viewing, he said, had been quite a task. The elder Roby, Herbert, had been drained entirely of blood through a gaping stab wound in his chest, while some kind of slashing instrument had left his daughter, Georgina, a ruin from head to waist. The funeral had been well attended, he said, and the bodies had been buried behind a church just around the corner from the funeral home.\n\nNext, while the rest of the group went to check out the Roby family home, **Thomas Moore** and **Valencia Chambers** took a trip to Whitehall Press, the publishing house who had put out *Der Wanderer durch den See*. Moore was curious about the \"A.R.\" who had written the disjointed book of poetry, but their inquiries didn't make much headway. The secretary on shift, a Mrs. Pattmore, told them that for books published anonymously or under pseudonyms, the company didn't always keep records of the author's given name. Frustrated, Moore tried to push the conversation further, and his rudeness ended up doing damage that no amount of smoothing over from Miss Chambers could fix. The pair were asked to leave rather bluntly.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhile Thomas and Valencia got into a screaming match with the secretary, **Lord Fagan**, **Enzo**, and **Dr. Tirol** had tracked down the new address of Grahame Roby, Alexander's older brother, who had sold the family home after the murders. These being business hours, Mr. Roby wasn't home, but they did manage to interview his cook, a miss Edna Vetch, about the night of the murders. The cacophany, she said, had awoken the entire house. The butler found the bodies when he went to check on the noise, and phoned the police immediately. When the constables arrived, they found Alexander sitting on his balcony. He claimed to have committed the murders himself, and begged to be arrested, but ultimately the savagery and brute strength shown in the murders was clearly outside of his capabilities, and instead of being charged with the killings, he was committed to St. Agnes' asylum. There was one more thing, Vetch recalled just as her guests were about to depart: She had heard a high-pitched whistle, just before the commotion that roused the rest of the household. Later, a black whistle was found in Alexander's bedroom; when blown, it produced the exact same sound that had preceded the murders. Satisfied with the answers they'd gotten, Fagan and the others headed back to the mansion, to meet with the others and compare notes.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBack at Tilson House, Thomas and Valencia shared what they'd learned at the publisher (or failed to learn) with the rest of the group. Fagan was unconvinced that they'd done everything they could, and immediately set back out, Enzo and Dr. Tirol in tow, to make a second pass at Whitehall Press.\n\nThis time they framed the reason for their visit carefully, claiming Enzo and Tirol were producers from Hollywood, and that Fagan was looking to bankroll one of their pictures. They were concerned, though, they told Mrs. Pattmore - they were interested in adapting a certain book, and they were afraid another studio was trying to scoop their idea. Had anyone else been by to ask about *Der Wanderer durch den See*?\n\nOf course the secretary said, as a matter of fact, a man and a woman had been by about the book, and very rude at that. Fagan gave her a knowing smile, and asked what it would take to procure the film rights for the work. This was all much beyond Mrs. Pattmore's depth, but she'd be happy to put Fagan in contact with a Mr. Pitt, the literary agent who had dealt with the original author. Fagan thanked her, and said he would be busy the following day, but if perhaps this agent could make a dinner this evening - naturally, she was invited as well, if she was so inclined.\n\nThe middle-aged secretary, quite smitten by the young lord, and impressed by his station and all the talk of Hollywood pictures, eagerly agreed, and the group went home to prepare for what was sure to be a productive dinner meeting. This wasn't to be, as Pattmore arrived bringing only a healthy appetite and regrets from Mr. Pitt. **Clay Morgan**, now free of project deadlines and still unable to get The King In Yellow out of his head, called for dinner as well. Valencia and Thomas, of course, stayed to their chambers for dinner - Mrs. Pattmore, after all, now believed them to be working for a rival studio. When the meal had concluded, Lord Fagan hurried their guest out of the mansion, and the group filled Clay Morgan in on what he'd missed in his time away. All in all, it made for a fascinating yarn, and Morgan all but insisted on accompanying them to the asylum the following day.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nDr. Highsmith was waiting at the station when the group arrived. He seemed a bit surprised at how many companions Tirol was bringing along, but greeted everyone cheerfully, and assured them that whomever he couldn't accomodate at the institution would be able to find lodging in the village for them.\n\nThe train ride was uneventful; Highsmith filled them in on some more details of Alexander Roby's case to pass the time. The young man suffered from horrible night terrors, but only periodically, it seemed - the episodes would fall dormant for months, then return for a period, then disappear again. Highsmith believed the condition treatable, and had managed to completely suppress the dreams with heavy doses of laudanum. For Alexander's part, he didn't talk much - though he had been caught with pencils several times, scribbling disjointed lines of poetry in English and German. How he got the pencils, Highsmith had no idea - the patients weren't allowed any kind of sharp objects, for obvious reasons.\n\nA car was waiting for them at the end of the train line, and took them through a small village, to St. Agnes' Asylum. Highsmith offered his guests tea, and showed them Roby's file. Dr. Tirol saw a lot of specific references to medicinal prescriptions, but couldn't make heads nor tails of it. Clearly he had taken too long a break from practice, and not for the first time, he wondered if he was the right man to help with this case, but he kept his doubts internal.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, it was time to meet Alexander himself. Highsmith abstained from the interview, hoping to get a better response from Roby if he only saw people he didn't know. Accompanying the investigators into the cell would be a secretary - to note down anything Alexander said, in shorthand - and an orderly, for their protection. Entering the cell, they were met with a rail-thin, straw-haired young man. He sat in a chair, with a blank look on his face, staring at the stone floor. As the group entered, he said one word, without looking up.\n\n\"Delia?\"\n\nThey weren't sure how to respond, or who Delia was. A few of the group tried to press Roby further with questions, but he was silent again, just staring at the floor. Finally, Dr. Tirol picked up one of the books scattered around the cell - a collection of Romantic poems - and began to read aloud. Without warning, and without looking up, Alexander set forth: Being locked in this room was inconvenient, he said, because there was work yet to do. He continued, at some length, about writers wasting their talents, then smiled to himself and was silent.\n\nIt was difficult to rouse Alexander to speech once more. Uncomfortably, the group shifted their weight from foot to foot, adjusted their jackets. Clay had taken a step back and was busying himself with a sketch. Finally, just trying out words to get a response, Valencia asked Roby if he'd heard of something called *Carcosa*.\n\n\"Have you seen the Pallid Mask?!\" Roby demanded suddenly, now quite animated. \"Have you been down by the lake and seen the beauty and felt the rightness of it all? Edwards said to work only with him. Are you with Quarrie? Why are they not here? Is it this year, once in five thousand years? Has Quarrie brought the King in Yellow? IS HE ALREADY AMONGST US?!\"\n\nSuddenly quieting, he looked up, piercing violet eyes meeting with the group for the first time. He whispered:\n\n\"Have you seen the Yellow Sign?\"\n\nThere was an uncomfortable pause. Nobody was sure what to say... and then Clay stepped forward, showing Roby what he'd been drawing: The Yellow Sign, perfectly rendered, somehow just as striking in pencil as it was in full color. The inmate slumped in his chair again, as if exhausted. He and Edwards were harming no one, he said, but Quarrie - Quarrie might be right. The King in Yellow might be the White Acolyte, and Quarrie wouldn't stay away. Unsure who Quarrie or Edwards were, the investigators didn't know what to make of Roby's tirade, and the next made even less sense, as he looked into their eyes once again:\n\n\"Here is a kindness to pass on to him when he sees that the King does not offer what he hopes. To divert the King's attentions away from our Earth and back upon the Dream City he must think of Cassilda's Song: \n&gt;*The stars that burn their charcoal death/ Shrink back, they feel the hoary breath/ Of he who ransoms/ Great Carcosa./ He flees where Queen and Prophet met/ Where twin suns fall but never set/ Escapes the tomb of/ Lost Carcosa.\"*\n\nAfter that, he fell silent again, and it quickly became clear they wouldn't rouse him. As they were leaving the cell, Valencia noticed a hole in the wall, straight through to the next cell. Thinking to listen in on Alexander in the night, she asked if anyone stayed there. The orderly said, yes, that cell belonged to a Lucius Harriwell - but the lady wouldn't want to spend the night in there even if it were empty. \"And can I ask why?,\" inquired Valencia.\n\n\"Why,\" the orderly replied, \"'Cos that's where the murder happened.\"\n\n*NEXT: Slayings at the Sanatarium!*",

        "text": "Might as well kick off where it all began. This is a prequel and introduction to a strange world that I still don't entirely understand and that's still underway.\n\nOur campaign started out with a promise. A promise of wealth, glory, and adventure in a new frontier where we could grasp the future with our own hands. Where we went there were these things. treasure to loot, enemies to best, and tales to be told of our doings; however, as we arrived we quickly learned the conditions of the hell we willingly entered. We found suffering, death, war on the streets, bodies tossed into pits with no thought of who the person was, what they did to deserve their fate, or who that body might fall on. We walked into the pits of Dungeon World, a end which none of us now would ever wish upon another. Unless we wanted them dead and forgotten.\n\nMight as well clarify the name thing. Our GM named the place Dungeon World and if you noticed the title you'd know that name of the system is also Dungeon World. It's quite appropriate given the location, which in times passed was a mining town. It was out of the way, small scale and could have stayed a peaceful little operation if they hadn't discovered what lied underneath it. Deep below the city was a labyrinth of tunnels, ruins, mines, that seemed to have no end. What the early explorers did know was that it was filled with treasure and artifacts waiting to be claimed. The city formed around this pit slowly evolving into a three tiered mining city with the dubbed \"Dungeon World\" entrance lying a the bottom center. Adventurers from around the world were invited to exploit the riches and for a while it worked.\n\nThis ideal situation lasted for as long as any realist would expect and soon greed took the hearts of those delving into its depths. In a whirlwind of violence and chaos groups were formed, battles were fought, and blood ran through the street. After the dust settled three groups stood and took power in the three tiers that formed the city. On the top ring (and this is the part where I can't take this seriously anymore) stood the 1st Tier Saints, a brutal, uncompromising gang that take what they want and leave bodies to rot. They're pretty nice people once you understand how they work. Holding the second tier were an organized group of necromancer Communists. Less outwardly violent than the 1st Tier Saints but if you lived here you followed their rules and divided your wealth. Finally on the third tier, well we never actually found out their names. We just always called them \"the guys from third tier.\" They still held to the ideal Dungeon World was founded on, a world of adventure and glory. They are literal knights in shining armor led by a aged dragon hunter, who keep away from the constant bloodshed of the world around them in favor of exploration. Finally, and most hidden were the Counsel, a shadowy group of five figure who ran the entirety of Dungeon World. We knew nothing about them, had no interaction with them, and are only now after eight months of game play discovering their hidden agenda. If any of us knew the bitter power struggles between the first two tiers, and the torture the third tier and the Counsel would put us through the five of us would never have walked through those gates.\n\nBut we did. And did we ever make an impression.\n\nOur original five were an interesting band: (read how the hell did we all meet up and agree to travel together?)\n\nThe party face for all of 3 and a half hours was Sigfried, a Viking Bard seeking to create a epic that would be told for centuries to come. Instead he died in the first session from a mixture of low health and the Spellslinger being an idiot. We left his naked body face first in an underground lake.\n\nSpeak of the devil, our Spellslinger Half-Dan was a Elven wild west sheriff looking to bring justice to a lawless town. He spends most of his time ruining well laid out plans and nearly killing everyone. Though without him we would be talking about said plans for hours out of game.\n\nNext up was our Wizard Fenfaril, an Elf who just wanted to learn about the mysteries of the world. Instead the universe decided he should be the focus of all suffering physically possible. From nearly dying every session, to watching friends die, to the slow realization that he will never be allowed to have any happiness ever the man has slowly drifted into a cycle of depression and despair. Also he had to clean up after my second character's bloody mess one time which did not help his mental state.\n\nSpeaking of bloody messes, we have the party's True Friend. I can't remember its name and I don't want to think about it. It basically had three mind slaves that it called \"friends\" who would always do what it asked of them, including devouring corpses. Every character was happy when it chocked on super dense snow.\n\nFinally (for the initial group) there was Faye the Human Thief (me). Hoping to make some quick coin off of stupid traders she got pulled into events she would normally never involve herself in. She was quiet and reserved spending most of her time looting corpses, rigging bets, and dealing with problems before they were problems. She also looted most of the party's collective gold and magic artifacts when she bailed. Good times.\n\nReplacing the deceased Bard was a Gladiator by the name of Kasius, an Elf slave who fought his way to freedom, only to be trapped in a different cage. He was big, scary, covered in tattoos, and kept to himself for the most part. He and I ended up running a small con where we would go to arenas, he would fight, and I would pressure the crowd to bet against him while placing my own money on him. We had a cool dynamic after working together for a while.\n\nThe friendship guy got a replacement as well but he died in one session. He was a pretty generic hero character. \n\nThere was a sixth character that started with us but he was consumed by his own plots, becoming a major NPC and instigator of rebellion. We know him as the Mask of the Abyss (see Lelouch from Code Geass and you get the idea.) \n\nThis core group of a Thief, Gladiator, Wizard, Spellslinger, and True Friend survived a good amount of ordeals that were throw our way, but well those are stories for another time. This is getting kinda long and I've just always wanted to tell someone about the strange group we pulled together in an even stranger situation. If you've read this all thank you for your time, I hope you have/had a good day.\n\nEdit: Minor spelling and I should have put \"The beginning **of a** story I've wanted to tell for a while.\" Oops it's late.

        "text": "[A continuing tale of my first pathfinder character, Tarkov the drunken russian midget.](http://redd.it/2l50cg) For those of you who weren't here last time, Tarkov and his drinking buddies (at the moment consisting of a trigger-happy hobgoblin gunner, an extremely unlucky cavalier, a pissy dragon sorceress, and a naive human monk) had just taken a first-class airship across a sea of clouds to dragon island and murdered the shit out of a sinister cult that was going to overthrow the local leadership. But though the pissy sorceress had made her golden dragon grandpappy proud, all was not well... the cult had succeeded in awakening an ancient dracolich, and this whole business reeked of Evil Demigod. And offal. Blood rituals are like that.\n\nWhile Tarkov and the hobgoblin gunner were working feverishly to erase the image of our [recurring villain](http://i.imgur.com/1pyvcG1.jpg) from their brains by way of copious amounts of alcohol, the rest of the party was getting the lowdown on the dracolich that was going to wreck everyone's shit. This was a serious situation, and the residents of the dragon island were called to action to defend their homes.\n\n...\n\nWell, don't everyone get up at once! Dragons are so fucking lazy...\n\nSo while we were grumbling about how these dragons are idiots, we got the lowdown about the dracolich, and then we left to fucking kill it, because murderhobos might not be the most reputable people but by the gods can they get shit done.\n\nThere was one small issue before we left, though- golden grandpappy dragon was going to be coming with us, and we had to leave *someone* in charge... so the burden of responsibility fell onto a pampered little fairy dragon who immediately declared himself dictator and demanded that all operations be immediately ceased in order to make the world's largest batch of cookies. Okay, let me know how that goes...\n\nThe dragon sorceress left with the dragons to go do dragon things to the undead dragon while the rest of us flew like hell to get to the super-phylactery which was the only thing that actually mattered. Unfortunately, the phylactery was guarded by a massive undead army.\n\nWhich is when Sean Connery, our glorious leader, revealed the ace up his sleeve: our airship was home to one [clockwork goliath](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/clockwork/clockwork-goliath). Oh, HELL, **YES**!\n\nAfter a cheesy power rangers transformation sequence, AWESOMETRON was stomping through those zombie idiots like NOBODY'S business. We actually had to travel through a large canyon with undead archers stationed absolutely goddamned everywhere, but they didn't have shit on a DR 15/adamantine construct of concentrated FUCK YOU. The canyon only came up to the shoulders of the behemoth, so we just slapped the arms out onto the clifftops and shoveled all the undead into the chasm below where we could stomp them without breaking stride. It was a bit like feeding a bag of weasels into a wood chipper.\n\nAt the end, we finally encountered some enemies who could put up a fight- a quartet of liches. The gunner took control of the cannon arm and fired off a couple balls of pain while the cavalier worked the more smashy arms in the world's most absurd game of whack-a-caster. Tarkov contributed by using his greater shout, completely ignoring the fact that he was still in his cockpit- an apt name, considering its location.\n\nImagine, if you will, watching a giant robot's crotch start to shake violently and burst open in a beam of concentrated russian screaming that vaporizes skulls on contact.\n\nMeanwhile, our naive monk was suddenly knocked off her perch (she was working the robot's windup key) and trapped on the opposite side of the canyon from the attacking lich. The monk promptly reminded everyone why it's awesome to be a monk- and those reasons were [Diamond soul](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Diamond-Soul-Ex-), [Abundant Step](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Abundant-Step-Su-) and [Quivering Palm](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Quivering-Palm-Su-).\n\nWith that business taken care of, we arrived at the massive necrodome where the dracolich's super-phylactery was hiding. Sadly, the entrance to the dome was too small for AWESOMETRON to crawl through, and it was made of some pretty sturdy material. It was pretty clear what to do next.\n\n(Note: if the obvious choice of action was NOT \"blast the hole wider with our cannon arm, take a running start and roll the mech through the hole because fuck walking\" then you are a stupid, boring person and I want nothing to do with you.)\n\nAnd with that, we were in. AWESOMETRON was battered and the key had snapped off somewhere during the tumbling (and the robot would wind down over the course of about 20 rounds), but we were inside and ready to wreck some shit. But there was still some trouble. See, the dracolich wasn't stupid, and decided to hide one more layer to his security- there wasn't just ONE object pulsating evil magic inside the necrodome, there were four, one for each point of the compass.\n\nSo we had to ask- which object was the real phylactery? Was it the teddy bear, the sinister looking ring, the mysterious orb, or the glowy crystal HAHAHA NICE TRY WE ALL SHOOT THE FUCKING BEAR.\n\nBut while AWESOMETRON was firing steel cannonballs into the world's sturdiest fucking cloth toy, something went horribly wrong. While we were dicking around in our giant robot, the horde of dragons had just brought down the dracolich. And because dracoliches are SERIOUS BUSINESS, they get to ignore things like rejuvenation times and surprise rounds.\n\nI OBJECT ON ACCOUNT OF THIS SUCKS FOR US.\n\nThe dracolich opened with its most powerful attack, a blast of negative energy breath that did absolutely jack to mechanical constructs. The DM ruled that we all took half damage from that (except for our gunner who was having some \"happy time\" and \"appreciating\" this \"sexy technological goddess\" and crit failed his saving throw), and not being idiots, we unanimously decided to keep the pressure on that goddamned teddy. Game over, asshole.\n\nAnd with that, we dusted our hands and called it a day. Well, right after checking whether the rest of the pulsating evil objects were worth anything (they weren't) and hauling the battered AWESOMETRON out of the necrodome. Yeah, Cap'n Sean wasn't too happy with us after he saw what we'd done to it, but we were going to have the whole ship ride home to work on repairs. The real issue was the giant sticky mess that had been left in the gunner's cockpit, for some reason (Sean had some \"words\" with the gunner's neck, face and stomach for that one).\n\nAnd with that, the world was saved and we could all retire and live happily on top of massive piles of gold and concubines.\n\nHuh? \"What about the evil demigod Festeros and his personal vendetta with you?\" Ahh, I'm sure that'll sort itself out. It's not like he was appearing to us each individually and promising to pull our intestines out of our throats while our families watched.\n\nNope. It's all sunshine and daisies from here.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"The fifth sense (because your hearing's gone for good)\", BITTER RIVALS AND TARKOV DRINKS HIS LAST BOTTLE OF VODKA!](http://redd.it/2lk8ec)",

That however was interrupted while he was riding outside of the City as he fell into portal of sorts, only to appear above manure carriage. With his good reflexes and acrobatic skill he managed to stay clean, cart however was destroyed to it's owner's dismay.\n\nWith quick look Kor noticed two things, for one he couldn't see any sides of the road and secondly a metropolis looming near horizon that seemed bigger that one city could ever be. Kor decided to disappear while the cart's owner was arguing with others who weren't as dexterous as Kor and had their fill of manure for a week.\n\nAt the gate Kor was briefly interrogated by the guardsman, some common questions and one regarding his \"odd\" clothing. Kor didn't really mind, telling the guard that he did come from farther away than most people. Guard didn't bother about it much either and let Kor inside without any incident. Kor then proceeded to find local tavern within slums that would be protected by local underground boss or some equivalent. At least he could be sure to have something to do...\n\nt didn't take long for Kor to find one establishment that didn't belong to the slums. Describing tavern of the Running Water with anything less than manor wouldn't be truthful. Pleased about how quickly he founded it, Kor entered and walked to the bartender like he'd been here before. Buying one of the most potent drinks the bartender had and downing it with one go impressed the half-ork bartender somewhat. Bartender asked Kor if he'd be able to deliver one envelope to\ncertain bakery inside the Metropolis. Kor, without much to do and new in town, agreed without much bargaining, although he was given the whole bottle of the stuff he asked earlier as a gift.\n\nThe bakery appeared to be a front of some sorts, as a dwarf who the envelope was for guided Kor through two other gates and the guards were somewhat afraid of him. Kor's mysterious dwarven guide led him to local engineer's guild and introduced him to it's guildmaster, a dwarf named Gragd. Later Kor found out that his guide was indeed person of great influence, but as a law abiding citizen. Gragd invited Kor to stay within the guild, offer which Kor agreed to happily as it included upkeep and place to stay.\n\nWithin next two months Kor gathered as much knowledge as he could from the guild. They had made many advancements in engineering, were they either constructs or weapons. One peculiar interest of his was to make dwarven steam gun light enough so that humans and other races could use it as well. With the help of Gragd, Kor managed to make steam carbine that he could use. That alone took one month, but he didn't mind. Knowledge was his price, his goal during that time.\n\nKor also frequented in Running Water and friendship of sorts formed between him and it's owner and bartender, Grag Blackfist. Blackfist's friendship wasn't the only thing he gained within the Running Water as blackfist had a few pretty one's in his tavern. One day Kor took of with Tanith, who worked as a pretty and told Blackfist \" I'll return her, someday, maybe..\" as he walked out. Blackfist might have been baffled enough to allow Kor to leave with one of his girls in\ntow, as he didn't stop Kor.\n\nWeek later Gragd approached Kor for he wanted Kor to be part of expedition force bound to island named as island of Dragons, which should have been lost in time or pure legend. It appeared, however, only few days prior to Kor's own appearance to this same world. It seemed that both appearances were foretold by some kind of engineer. From what Kor understood of Gragd's explanation that person was part of cleric, part of oracle and a raving madman with a knack for engineering. Kor just let it be as there were knowledge that he couldn't understand. Divine things were just one of many. What gained his attention was Gragd's second offer, a vial of unknown liquid. Gragd asked to either drink or not, without asking any questions of the nature of the drink. He explained however that it should fix his \"problem\" with water. Kor was sure that he didn't tell about it to anyone, but drank the liquid anyways.\n\nAs soon as he drank the liquid, Kor was overcome by hallucinations. Standing alone on the beach, he saw a hideous creature rising from the ocean. It asked Kor if he regrets his decisions. Kor's hallucination ends before he could answer. This led Kor to question some of his choices, most of all his lack of faith in divine. For better or worse he didn't have much time to think about his choices as he receives the King's summons.\n\nMeeting with the King was more straightforward than what Kor had thought it would be. The meeting was housed in one of Sigathun's many guildhouses, and it seemed that everything was already drafted in other meetings. Most likely this meeting was only to get him and two more people meet up and give some final input to otherwise finalised plans. Kor's only input was limited on where to land on the island. It however was disregarded in favor for landing on the other side of island as there supposedly were ancient city of equally ancient breed of orks.\n\nKor got bored with the meeting and notices that few of the expedition members eye's were fixed on Tanith. While having nothing better to do he started teasing them with Tanith. He had fun watching Elric Tsiehta, elven rogue, blush quite nicely. Gragd too was amused by it but told to keep it down. Kor did stop teasing others but had lost all interest in the actual meeting. He had some time to gather all the equipment he and Tanith would need. At least before second shipment of goods and manpower would arrive to the island.\n\n( This concludes the intro part of the new campaign. Quite railroaded, but it was enough to get the team together. All hallucination stuff was made secretly and the team isn't aware that one of them is a trigger happy madman with two other personalities, and one hell of a fear towards water. Also the creature in Kor's hallucination is nothing else but Mantorok.... )\n",

        "text": "[Part 1!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2k53jh/pathfinder_the_inquisitions_investigation/)\n\nTLDR of part1; WWI ish setting where arcane magic is banned.Children were disappearing, Inquisition (party) was sent to investigate, a witch used the them to mine something, she got away.\n\nReturning to a sense of order after the battle, the party got to investigating both the children and the area that they were mining. William could not wake them with smelling salts nor could Phineas with his bardic abilities. Instead a series of litters were made to carry them out of the mine. Examining the mining site William found that there was apparently some object excavated from the wall. Upon further inspection the object was buried naturally, not intentionally. Collecting soil samples for further analysis the two engineers found a small sliver of crystal, though neither could place what it was, and it was kept along with the soil for further analysis. With nothing else worthy of immediate attention the party made way to return to Roanne, the comatose children and body of Max in tow.\n\nWhen they returned, night having already fallen, the town was assembled in the square with the town guards at attention. The party wisely decided to take the children into the Town Hall discreetly while Javert broke away to speak with Father Pontmercy about arranging a burial for Max the following day. Brother, Phineas, and William met with the mayor and informed them of the events in the mine and asked for information about the witch they battled there. Though the mayor couldn’t recall her he recommended they look through the town archives for any criminals or fugitives matching her description. He also suggested that they visit the former mayor who had since retired to a smaller hamlet on the lake, near Orlene. After promising that the children would be looked after, including the orphans and gypsies, the Mayor asked the party to accompany him as he addressed the town. The speech was short; The Inquisition was credited with saving the children, whose condition was kept a secret except from relatives, the crisis appeared to be over, and a funeral and memorial service would be held for Max, who bravely gave his life in service to the community. The celebration of the end of the crisis was tempered by that somber news. Still for the first time in months Roanne let out a sigh of relief that they had been holding in for so long. \n\nAfter the funeral the next morning the party was split on what to do. Phineas and William had looked through the old records and found pages missing from the list of criminals, dating back nearly 20 years, though Javert’s scrying could not find them, and the record was likely destroyed. William wanted to visit the old mayor and see if he could help the Inquisition track down the mysterious woman. Javert and Brother however wanted to continue on to Alsace, the trading post next likely to disappear, which may have some connection to what had occurred in Roanne. Phineas wanted to get more information on the crystal shard. In his and William’s experiments last night the shard had reacted powerfully to magic, glowing violently bright and then cracking in half when too much magical energy was poured into it. Eventually it was decided that Javert would organize a team of former miners to continue digging at the site to see if anything else unusual would be found while the party would continue on to the more immediate concern of Alsace. Messages were also sent to the Inquisitor Temple in Orlene updating the Hierarch of recent developments and another to the former mayor asking about the witch.\n\nDeparting from Roanne the party made their way to Alsace as night was falling. A creeping mist from the cold north had settled over the town. It was deserted, they had arrived too late. Combing through the ghost town the party found obvious signs of struggle; doors were bashed in, furniture upturned, dried blood on the floors. Like the other villages that had disappeared nothing of value seemed to be missing though. The only body that was found belonged to a man named Andre, who was found in his home with multiple slash wounds and his sword by his side. Andre was a retired military scout turned tracker in his older years though apparently he did not go into death without a fight. Near him Phineas found an odd metal part, coated in a glistening oil, that seemed reminiscent of a human scapula. Further searching around town turned up a scattering of parts, including what appeared to be a finger, all made of the same metal. The digit twitched in response to the touch of the crystal, which William and Phineas came to believe was some sort of a power source, though what it was and what it powered were worryingly unknown. The party made camp for the night and pondered these mysteries.\n\nIn the morning the party continued on to Ft. Kinmouth which oversaw the transport up and down the Eure River, a major waterway that linked Scythia to Scaldval. The fort commander was largely unimpressed with the party’s warning of disappearing villages. “Scaldval raider come down from the north now and again. We have our scout parties searching for this war band and we’ll bring those barbarians to justice. Otherwise there’s not much else we can do. Those people knew the risk of living that close to the border.” Brother had some choice words about the honor and compassion of the commander who so wantonly wrote off the lives of hundreds of people but Javert was able to soothe relations with the commander. The commander dismissed them and suggested that Phineas and William speak to the garrison’s engineer about the metal components they had found, along with the crystal, before returning to his work muttering about the need for clearer hierarchies between the military and the Inquisition. \n\nThe garrison’s engineer, Pierre, was an eccentric man, obviously overqualified for overseeing the water gates at the fort, though it was likely his “energetic” talking and scatterbrained behaviour that earned him a position at this remote outpost. Though Pierre was intelligent to a fault he couldn’t place the exact quality of the metal, though said it was some steel alloy. Likewise he had nothing to say of the strange crystal but remembered a professor he had at the academy, DaPonte, who maybe could help the party identify it. He offered Phineas and William  his library (really a small collection of obtuse textbooks) and workshop for their investigation as well. Phineas elected to stay with Pierre for awhile longer to see what he could uncover while the rest of the party decided to continue on to the next village in line, assuming that it was at higher risk than the fort to be raided. Javert managed to convince the commander to send a small contingent of scouts, 12 men and their sergeant, with him to the next village as added protection. Promising to meet up later, William, Javert, and Brother, along with the scouts, left Phineas and the fort behind. In his research Phineas found that the metal could have been any one of a number of alloys, most of which were developed in his native Ochremark.\n\nMeanwhile the other three members of the Inquisition made their way to the next village, little more than a collection of homes where 8 family eked out an existence on the frontier. Seeing that this was obviously an indefensible location if the raiders could take larger villages with ease Javert, through skilled negotiation, convinced those families to evacuate and make their way to the next village, which would hopefully have more numbers in case a larger defense force was needed. Brother dispatched his messenger hawk, which had also never been mentioned until this point, to Ft. Kinmouth informing Phineas of their updated plans. The refugees and their guards arrived in Freemont a day later and prepped the village for attack.\n\nThe night before the fort found itself under siege. Phineas and Pierre awoke to the alarm blaring and soldiers running to their battle stations. Phineas looked out from the engineering tower in time to see the searchlights around the fort being shot out by projectiles. As confusion mounted the soldiers took position firing blindly into the darkness. As Phineas crept forward to get a closer look the main gate imploded in a shower of metal and wood. Into the courtyard swept a wave of metal men carrying swords who engaged the soldiers. Towering over them was a scorpion like contraption upon whose back stood a titan of a man carrying a warhammer made of the same metal as the automatons ruthlessly slaughtering humans. The warhammer wielding barbarian jumped into the fray and killed indiscriminately with ease. Phineas noticed the command squad making their way to him, though it soon became apparent that the invader would be more than a match from them. \n\nPhineas wanted to get one of the fallen metal men for examination though it was clearly impossible for him to do stealthily. Instead he signaled to Pierre to the guard tower which housed a cannon. Hoping to destroy the scorpion, which was decimating the garrison, the two snuck up to the tower. Leveling the cannon at the mechanical monster a shell ripped forth from the cannon… and missed, killing a number of both man and machine. The barbarian, finished with smashing apart the command squad turned to the tower and bellowed a war cry before tearing through the confusion of the battle. Pierre reloaded the cannon and Phineas barricaded the door with what he could as the barbarian advanced, literally throwing men and automatons out of his way. Phineas and Pierre managed to get another round off at the scorpion, missing again, before the door burst open, the barbarian standing sweaty and enraged. Taking this as their cue to leave, Phineas and Pierre dove over the wall, trusting feather fall to save them, and into the river below. Despite the cold of the water they swam to the opposite bank, leaving behind them the war cry of a predator who lost his prey. They fled on through the forest and through the night, with the burning fort behind them. ",

        "text": "I’d just like to say that I did not intend to leave the previous post on such a sappy cliffhanger. That story was one that me and my idiot friends love to retell, and it felt like the time had come to put it down formally. However my inept mage friend probably does warrant the attention of another post, and I will happily oblige.\n\nBefore I continue, a small measure of background should be shared. First off, the assasin and playwrite were played by my two best friends of almost 15 years. The playwrite, who I will refer to as Bill, has a tendency to scheme, plot and generally be an asshole in the games we play. It is one of those things you understand the first time you sit at a table with the guy, and generally come to appreciate it when his plans finally play out. The second he walks away from the table however, he’s a genuinely good guy if not a bit of a smart ass. In all the games we had played this had been a fairly open and well understood concept, and provided much amusement in the later stages of the various story arcs.\n\nThe mage’s player, Tom, however was not as clear cut. We had become friends at a crappy retail job and as I had attempted to introduce role-playing to him, he introduced war gaming to me. Warhammer 40k was a deep passion for him, and since moving back to the area he had lost his group of willing combatants. With a steady job and a lot of time on my hands, I followed him headfirst into the hobby and began building an army of my own.\n\nAt first, things were fresh, new, and exciting. I purchased a small army and played weekly bouts suplimented by the vast collection of old figures Tom had in his basement. As we enjoyed ourselves, more people stopped in and played with us, each game becoming a bit of a spectator sport. Even in those early days however, it became apparent that Tom did not like to loose. Despite my appreciation for subtlety and well laid plans, I tend to game on the simple and straightforward side. My army and tactics exemplified this. Week after week I would show up with roughly the same army, small changes occasionally as I felt my way around the codex. Week after week, Tom would fall somewhere around turn three and conceded the game when too many of his forces were removed from play.  It was mentioned to him repeatedly that he could never win if he did not see the game through, but Tom had some warped version of how the game should go in his head, and when it did not he began to break down.\n\nTwo points should be made clear. First off, I do not consider myself a highly competent player, not by a long shot. When I played others in our little group, I did average at best, many taking advantage of my simplistic style of play. Against Tom however, I was the reaper. I sweapt through his ranks like a whirlwind, tearing into his back field so quickly and violently that even I began to feel bad about it. A combination of luck, horrible tactics on his side and a singularly play style, this continued well on past the point it should have. With every win, Tom’s demeanor changed, slightly more jaded as the font of rage built under the surface. Now by no means was this not effecting the rest of us, everyone began to feel on edge. If you have played many wargames, you know the time and effort that goes into setting up a match. We once drove thirty minutes to a game store, spent twenty minutes or so setting up a match only to have Tom conceded after the very first two dice rolls of the game. One missle, one kill, game over.\n\nFrom an outside perspective, it is obvious that Tom was unstable and we should have just cut ties with him until he learned to control himself. As a gamer, the thought of loosing the outlet was a little harder to deal with, and I spent much time convincing myself and those around me that Tom just needed to find a game he could enjoy. It was these exact conversations I was having after Bill’s playwrite killed Tom’s mage.\n\nEven after wrapping up a long campaign, it does not take long for the gaming urge to creep back in. Bill decided to take on the mantle of DM and introduce us to his post apoccolyptic GURPS world. We rolled up characters that sounded fun, and struck out for fame and fortune. As we met up for the first time in a clock work version of the matrix, (Bill’s a weird guy), we checked out our roster. I played a kleptomaniac cat burgler with a over bearing curiosity. I was joined by a Sweadish death metal drummer with a bad opiate addiction, and a professional baseball player who had taken one to many balls to the head. Tom debued his character, an ex-solider who had battle wounds that all but crippled him, and an intelligence that might have actually been lower then his own. His name was General Winters, and his only purpose was to shoot a modern assault rifle that he would never find ammo for in the barren wastelands that lay outside the clockwork construct. This was pointed out to him, numerous times, along with the realization that he had not given the character a first name. He never did.\n\nWhat followed was a steady pattern of finding new towns, causing fights in their brothels, and burning them down to the ground as we made our way through the land. At first it felt good, all the destruction and crippling of anything that resembled a plot. In the end however, we spent a good two months repeating the same murder-hobo routine and ended up wrapping the game up all together with the understanding that Bill would not be DM’ing any time soon.\n\nRetreating to a more familiar story telling system, we started Vampire: The requiem. Modeling the setting after our own tri city area, the players got the chance to carry out their blood fueled plot lines in their own backyard, often with amusing results. The mantle of story teller falling back upon my shoulders, we rolled up a crew of misfits and set them into the world of the undead. Staying with his new strategy of playing one dimensional characters, Tom rolled up a gangrel that was pretty good and punching things. Care to take a guess what he spent his time doing? Time to shake down a thug for information? Punch him! Older vampire warning you to back off her territory? Punch her! Sheriff shows up outside your haven, warning you against acts of aggression? Punch him! Needless to say, I spent most of my time coming up with reasons to keep Tom alive and in the game. Every session began with a mangled corpse being pulled out of torpor, and every session ended with another knock out. Tom’s vampire spent his day’s soaking in a blood bath, and his nights getting his face caved in. Steadily Tom deferred his actions to the rest of party, and eventually barely joined in, regardless of what plot hooks were dangled in front of him.\n\nAfter the campaign was over, I spent a while searching for a way to reach out to Tom and show him the fun that could be had gaming. A revelation came when I stumbled upon 4th edition D&amp;D. A core roleplaying game built around the concept of an MMO? What could go wrong?\n\nA few weeks later the table was set, the characters were rolled up and we started working through the Keep on the Shadowfell.  Tom played a fighter tank, decked out with ability cards so everything was laid out before him. Bill played a bard, full of himself and trying to spread word of his greatness throughout the world. The rest of the group consisted of a gnome Psion, human cleric and a halfling rogue played by a coworker at my new job. The rogue’s player was new to roleplaying and a bit of an chaotic asshole. He definitely spiced up the group, but also did not understand when it was time to back off.\n\nAt first the game went very well. The players liked the system, even if it took much longer to play. I enjoyed sending swarms of rats and goblins against the group, always pushing them to the breaking point before crumbling under the weight of their onslaught. Tom began enjoying himself too, fitting into the role of the groups tank and treating the game like a tabletop version of wow. He would order the group to attack in certain ways, most blatantly straight forward. Occasionally he would spot a tactical advantage and use it with moderate success. All seemed to be going well.\n\nA few weeks into the game, I decided to try my hand out in building an encounter instead of running the remaining encounters in the module. A little inspiration, a little elbow grease and a whole lot of hunting for stats and I had added a vampire’s crypt to the module. Loaded with puzzles, custom loot and a few cool boss fights, the module had my hopes up as we met once again around the table.\nThe group stumbled upon a magically sealed alchove and after a few roles found themselves in the entrance way to a ancient crypt. As they decided what to do, a ghostly image appeared and explained that it had been sealed deep within as punishment for crimes long since past. Begging the adventurers to free it, it instructed them on the two methods which would lead to its freedom. Either a willing sacrifice must be made in a near by well filled with swirling magical energies, or the group would have to make it to the treasure vault at the end of the crypt and disrupt the runes binding the spirit. Sitting back, pleased with myself, I watched as the group discussed their next actions. The spirit was obviously sinister, belonging to an ancient vampire lord, but it hardly mattered. The path to the end of the crypt was laid out before them, and a good session of traps, tricks and monster loomed a head. No one however could have foreseen the decision that was made by the groups cleric.\n\n“I jump into the well”, the cleric proudly professed with a defiant grin. Played by my other best friend, the cleric of the raven queen was the sum of everything anti undead. A simple roll could have told him the true nature of the spirit, but on that particular night he felt the need to call my perceived bluff. Shocked and confused, I took him into the other room and asked him if he was sure. He reaffirmed his actions and stood baffled when I explained that his character was now a swirling pile of ooze and his deity was very upset.\n\n“Well fuck...” my friend replied. We talked a little about how in a further session down the road, his character could come back into the game with the experience forever burned onto him, and he liked the idea. As I returned to the group, I caught the eye of Tom and recognized the signs of rage building within. Something was about to happen.\n\nAs I explained the cleric’s actions and their outcome, the group laughed at his stupidity and asked if there was still treasure in the crypt. I told them there was, and had the vampire mock them a bit before floating off to get revenge on whoever had imprisoned him there in the first place. The players decided to move forward and check out the first hallway and its hidden trap, as I went through each person’s actions. When I got to Tom, he sat defiantly back in his seat, starring across the table.\n\n“So our Cleric is dead?” he asked with venom in his tone. I was trying to figure out what I had missed when he continued. “Fuck this...I’m not going any further. I pop a squat.”\n\nWords that have run in infamy. He popped a squat. The group asked him to explain. He responded that he would not go anywhere without his healer, he was the tank and he was in charge. When we reminded him that this was D&amp;D and not World of Warcraft, he further retreated, shutting down emotionally. Sitting, arms crossed with a furious look on his face, he defiantly glared at the table.\n\nAs we discussed alternatives, everyone began to grow angry. Tom single handed was holding up the game and refused to come along, like some spoiled child. Everyone tried to reason with him until finally the rogue, in his usual assholish attitude, made a snide comment about pushing him into the well.\n\n“I attack the bard!”, Tom announced violently standing up. Completely baffled, Bill asked again and again what he had done to piss Tom off. Tom tried to come up with some conspiracy that they were plotting to kill his character, when clearly the Rogue’s comment had not been taken seriously. At this point, my anger took over and I exerted my authority. Telling everyone to sit down and be still, I gained control over the group again and realized that the session was over. As Tom snatched his figurine from the table, I began to clean up and told him to wait for me in my truck. The group rioted, the second he stepped out the door. It was obvious that the group needed to be free from Tom. I made my apologies, mended fences as best I could and retreated to my Truck to drive Tom and myself home.\n\nOn the way home I expected him to be at least a little sorry for what he had done. Instead I was treated to a ten minute rant about how Bill had been out to get him, ever since our first exalted game. He began digging up things that were quite literally, years old. As he ranted the mental scar created by that fate full night so long ago stretched out before me. About halfway home I snapped back at him. I told him that our group of idiots had spent there night off coming to the game to have fun, and single handed he had turned a year old vendetta into the end of the game.\n\nA week or so later I ended up picking up the rest of my 40k supplies that I had left in Tom’s basement and cut ties with him. Aside from occasionally bumping into him around town, I haven’t seen Tom in a long time, a fact that I am probably the better for. Bill on the other hand still loves the knowledge that he scarred a 26 year old so bad, he had a mental break down a year later. ",

        "text": "[A continuing tale of my first pathfinder character, Tarkov the drunken russian midget.](http://redd.it/2l1a6n) For those of you who weren't here last time, Tarkov and his comrades (consisting of a trigger-happy gunner, a pissy dragon sorceress, the world's unluckiest cavalier, and a cowardly frogman cleric) had just confronted the empress of a floating island nation about various important topics like the plight of the imprisoned, the importance of a justice system, and the finer parts of point-blank sonic attacks. Just before she was about to go down fighting, Sean Connery burst in to save the day, riding a massive gold dragon.\n\nAnd then it turned out that Sean Connery was actually the empress's father, Sean was way older than he looked, the gold dragon was the pissy sorceress's grandfather, and everyone got all huggy and emotional. Tarkov vowed not to have any part in it, and promptly got shitfaced and started hitting on the empress's strix bodyguard who had recently planted a couple of swords in Tarkov's back. Hey, it was just business, right?\n\nSo people gabbed and stories were told and plot hooks were dangled and the cavalier's arms were regrown and then we all got back on the freaking airship so that we could go visit the island of the dragons because reasons. Unfortunately our old crew was dead (thanks, Fester), but with the help of a really abrasive necromancer, we were back in the air. Except that now we had to take that fucking necromancer with us. He was a player character who popped in as an exiled servant of the empress, and small wonder why he'd been given the boot- he was just an utterly unrepentant treacherous fuckwad. To put it mildly, he rubbed Tarkov the wrong way.\n\nSeeing as that particular player never joined us in any other sessions, I like to think that Tarkov just pushed him over the side of the airship one day and people just stopped talking about him.\n\nOn the way to our destination, we came across a small floating island with a couple of hitchhikers. Seriously. They had actually been marooned there by someone (here's where our gunner started making uncomfortable noises and fiddling with his collar) and were hoping to catch a ride to wherever, so we gained two new party members! The first was a was a sexually frustrated ninja kitsune who had been trying (VERY unsucessfully) to hit on the oblivious human female monk, who was at once so naiive and badass that we all instantly took a liking to her.\n\nTarkov went up to her and asked if they could go get dinner, and then maybe have wild monkey sex. She was up for dinner, but turned town the sex. Oh well, worth a shot. I don't know why the idiot ninja never thought to just flat-out ask, jeeze...\n\nAnyway, before dinner could happen, we arrived on the dragon island where the pissy sorceress's more dragony family lived. The gold dragon was the current king, but he was getting super old and wanted a worthy successor. For some reason he thought the short-tempered and constantly irate sorceress would be a better successor than the shadowy group that was organizing a coup-\n\n\"Oh, THAT is why we are here. I was curious.\"\n\nYeah, Tarkov was not one to pay attention to the mission briefings. Long story short, weird shit was going on somewhere on the island and the gold dragon was going to send us to murderhobo it out of existence because getting the actual dragons off of their fat asses and away from their hordes is a little like herding cats that can breathe fire. Wonder what would happen if you tried using a laser pointer?\n\nSo we traveled into the depths of the island, and found the place chock-full of dragon dudes, drakes (basically non-intelligent dragons) and weird culty shit. The cavalier stabbed a few dudes, the gunner shot a few dudes, the gunner's murderchameleon ate a guy, and the ninja failed at ninja-ing. Maybe our group wasn't cut out for subtlety. At the end of a winding cavern, we found a big, heavy door that practically had \"THIS IS A TRAP\" spraypainted on it in neon, glow-in-the-dark letters. While the party debated the finer points of \"sneaking\" into a place with only one entrance, Tarkov popped the fucking door of its hinges and instructed the monk to grab it and move forward, covering everyone behind it while we had a nice look-see at what was about to ambush us.\n\nDid you know that a three-inch solid steel door is more effective than a tower shield? Well, those archers waiting for us learned that pretty quick. Then they got a quick course on fireballs, bullets and weaponized screaming.\n\nThe trap was a bit more elaborate than that, though. The room was also home to several drakes and a couple of casters, who scoff at silly things like doors. What they don't scoff at is a ninja decapitating your buddies while a drunken russian pops behind you and screams until your eyes bleed. As for the drakes, they were a bit harder to pin down, what with being able to fly and having more than 30 hit points. The pissy dragon sorceress's spells weren't doing much good, either, because she was up to the eyeballs in fire spells and fire-related abilities and half of the drakes were red. Thankfully, one of us had a plan.\n\n\"I have 'throw anything' as a feat. Can I throw the door?\"\n\n\"Sure, but you'd have to make a strength check-\"\n\n\"Wait, nevermind- I use a ki point to boost my acrobatics!\"\n\nWe all watched in awe as the monk vaulted off the floor, adjusted her angle by kicking off some stalactites, and *[SMASHED A DRAKE OVER THE HEAD WITH A STEEL DOOR](http://i.imgur.com/f6ctvfm.jpg)*. I mean, talk about epic first sessions, right?\n\nWe mopped up the rest of the mooks and made our way towards the main chamber, where the head dickbag was hiding. That guy was a full-fledged red dragon, and was a buddy of a cousin of the stepsister of the pissy sorceress or something and he would overthrow golden grandpappy and acquire his rightful place on the HEY GUESS WHAT [KI SHOUT](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/k/ki-shout). This pissed off the dragon pretty effectively, and he ate Tarkov.\n\nWell, I say ate, but it was more like being partially chewed on and then blasted across the room by an empowered fire breath. Tarkov was alive, though, because he hadn't taken any other damage during the whole fight. Everyone underestimates the gnome, even when he's at level 19.\n\nAnyway, the pissy sorceress decided shit was ON and transformed herself into a full-fledged dragon. A smackdown followed, and then we congratulated ourselves on a job well done. Then we learned why the head asshole had locked himself in a room during the squabble with his mooks- he'd been working on a blood ritual that would awaken an ancient dracolich to come on down to dragon town and bring on some good old-fashioned apocalypse. Oh, and the ritual was already complete.\n\nWELP.\n\nOn a related note, the the hobgoblin gunner started insisting that the ghost of Fester was popping up and [getting grabby](http://i.imgur.com/1pyvcG1.jpg). Oh, and the dragon dudes were all in a cult to a dark god called Festeros, who was also the guy behind there being a dracolich in the first place.\n\nTarkov renewed his vow to piss of the corpse of that creepy fucker.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Game of gnomes\", TYRANNY OF THE DRAGON LORD AND 101 WAYS TO MAKE THE DM REGRET GIVING YOU COOL TOYS!](http://redd.it/2lb2l7)",

        "text": "I started DMing for a group of my friends a few months ago. We don't play often but when we do there is always one common occurrence: The Druid's pet dinosaur will wreck all sorts of shit. The Druid had affectionately named him Snarky, as he decided that was what the little dino could say. So whenever Snarky does anything it is always accented with an exclamation of, \"SNARKY!\"\n\nEverything started when I took them through a mine filled with a highly contagious disease. Things were going well and they had made it to the final boss. I like to play with a bit of improvisation. It keeps things open if someone goes against the established story, or even just makes a joke that I think works with the events taking place. At one point they were supposed to be attacked by a group of zombie miners, and they asked if they were miners or minors. I decided they would be fighting Miner Minors.\n\nWhen they attack an enemy I will go into detail about what specifically happens instead of just saying, \"You hit\" or \"You miss\". This especially comes into play with critical hits and critical misses.\n\nThe final boss for this particular campaign was an orc with some invisibility potion. He fought hard, but eventually became weakened due to the party's efforts. But the next turn fell to Snarky. Snarky moved in to attack. Natural 20. He scampered up to the orc and looked at him with his adorable little face. As the orc looked upon Snarky, he realized the destruction he was causing with his rituals and vowed to change his ways. His heart grew three sizes that day. He then quickly died due to complications of an enlarged heart.\n\nLater the group was fighting a pack of skeletons and Snarky rolled another natural 20, causing him to make a skeleton completely collapse by tearing out its femur so that he could have something to chew on.\n\nLast night we regrouped to fight a fallen paladin that I had cooked up. The party already had a paladin so he was eager for some good old fashioned Good vs Evil. He was not prepared. The fallen paladin quickly wrecked his shit and set his sights on the remainder of the party. That's when Snarky rolled another natural 20.\n\nAt that moment the Druid played [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUCcmjaCL_c) While it was playing, I described how Snarky lifted into the air as a brilliant light flowed from his body. The entire party was brought back to full health and the fallen paladin found himself redeemed of his sins. I had no intention of having this NPC live past this fight, so now I have a new character to tool around with.\n\nWe have yet to finish this campaign, and the Druid informed me that he has concocted a thorough backstory for Snarky, detailing the fact that he is a god. No one will be surprised.",

        "text": "Many years ago, after ending an emotional tenure with our previous DM, I found myself in the middle of a group of players looking for a game. With no one else willing to bare the burden, I foolishly decided to take on the mantle of story teller and launch a new campaign. After gathering two new players to fill out the group, we started a six month long Exalted campaign that would shape the destiny of two of the players for years to come.\n\nFor the record, I hold no delusions that my content was anything more than trite regurgitated scenes collected from my years as an avid gamer. The group however was more than willing to dive into my little cliche fantasy, and find their own stories to pursue. So, meeting on a weekly basis we began our journey.\n\nPlaying as solar exalted, we had a well rounded group of five sun warriors ready to take on the armies of the Scarlet Empress. Lead by a kama wielding monk assasin type, the group consisted of a walking wall of armor, a playwright with an uncanny ability to make magically biding contracts, the universe’s most inept mage, and a ranger who was delighted to simply be out of the house. At first, this group of misfits found enough amusement in wandering from town to town, setting up plays for the residents before burning down their homes in some various choatic brawl. Fun was had, the players seemed to be enjoying themselves, and as a new DM I relished the warm affection for my story. This chain of massacres quickly became dull as the group sought more depth from their role-playing, and I set out to create a more fulfilling plot for them to explore.\n\nWith a little reincarnation abuse, some material taken from various supplements and the introduction of an possible traitor in the group, a half-assed plot was born and each player picked out what they felt was important. Our assasin leader embroiled himself in an ancient plot by his former self to break into the mythical loom of fate after learning he was a traitor in his previous life. The inept mage sought to compete with our playwright in an attempt to steal the world’s most powerful font of magical energies and the walking wall of plate wandered off killing everyone in his path. In fact every player seemed to have a plot line in mind to follow except for our humble ranger, who did little more than show up, have fun, and in one instance earn a boon from the Moon Goddess which he traded for a magical arrow. Being the first time he showed heightend interest in the game, I indulged the ranger and allowed him to come up with a magical arrow himself, one that once fired would never stop until it lodged itself in it’s intended victim’s heart. Obviously my lack of experience showed in letting such a thing into the game, but like I said, more often than not the player in question was just happy being out of the house.\n\nThe weeks passed, and the band of misfits continued on their respective paths, all except for the plate wielding murder machine. Apparently not even his massive body count could keep his attention, and he left the group for good, something that was bound to happen.  As the group began to move into its final stage in play, and the end came visible for some of the players, our inept mage was brought to the fore front. Outside of the game, the player behind the character was having problems understanding how he could further his effectiveness in combat. Coming from a strong back ground in console gaming, the idea of using his imagination was as alien as you could get. My answer to his problems, as fresh DM, was to give him a book from another gaming system, Mage: The Awakened, and let him use the spell book to come up with ideas for his magical attacks. At his point it should be known that I essentially had given this player an unlimited font of spells to use, affecting any part of reality. With his character being the only one involved in the arcane arts, I was struggling to get him to open  up and come up with new ways to use his talents.  With the addition of a magical mentor, week after week a large portion of our sessions would be spent trying to coax the mage into coming up with any sort of magical attack that did not involve throwing a fire ball. This culminated into a one on one duel with a red dragon, in which the mage had access to an unlimited font of magical energy and used it to hurl a fire ball at his opponent.\n\nAfter given up on trying to expand the mind of our failed arcane master, the final run to the end of the game began. The mage and playwright raced to the font of arcane power, contained in a trap filled ancient dungeon. At the same time, the assasin lead an army to attack the current political power, after finding out that he was framed as the traitor in his previous life, a fact that the ranger suspiciously was not privy to. As always, our trustworthy ranger was there for the ride, joining in on the combat and just enjoying time away from his wife.\n\nBefore the final session, the playwright came to me and outlined his plans for spending the massive amount of experience he had stored over the course of the campaign. Seeing the mage’s eventual downfall outlined in his plans, I tried to rationalize what would be fair once the session started. As we sat down and began, the playwright and mage made their way through the dungeon and the assasin and ranger assaulted the loom of fate.\n\nAs the mage and playwright made their way to the last room in the complex, they uncovered a lock that could only be passed with a willing sacrafice by a companion. Getting a wicked grin on his face, the mage declared his assault on his fellow adventurer and the dice were rolled. Immediately the disparity between their initiatives was apparent, and anyone with any sense felt what was coming. The playwright readied an action and let the mage go. This being his final sorcerous act for the game, the mage dug deep into his imagination and let go with yet another fireball. Go figure. What he did not expect was our innocent playwright spending all his experience to learn spell casting and exactly one spell; counter spell. The roll was made, the mage was neutered, and the playwright spent the next turn using his overwhelming social skills to convince the mage to kill himself and allow his passage into god hood.\n\nAs this little horror show was left hanging on the our players mind, the assasin finally broke his way past all opposition and made his way into the loom of fate. He quickly enacted his ancient plan and corrupted the loom, granting himself power over the lines of fate of each individual in the world. The game was at an end, two players stood in positions of ultimate power and I was allowing each player left standing to say their final piece. The playwright consolidated his position of power and taunted the dead mage with his long term planning. The Assasin cut a few strings out of spite and generally basked in his achievement. At last I turned to the ranger and asked what his character would do with his final moments in the campaign, and without batting an eye he replied. “I’m shooting the assain with my heart seeker arrow.”\n\nAs the group sat stunned, I dug through my notes and realized what I had allowed by making that arrow. The assasin, no matter how currently powerful was indeed doomed. His player immediately protested, demanding a motive for the action. The ranger calmly explained that although he had known the assasin to be a traitor in their previous lives, he had not heard the revelation that his was framed. Thus it was his idea all along to kill him at the most opportune moment, which happened to be just as he got everything he ever wanted.  Out of spite, the assasin cut all the strings in the loom and doomed my little fantasy world to a violent end. Even though he was baffled by the turn of events, the assasin’s player marveled at the long laid plot against him and we all celebrated a shocking end to the game. Well all of us but the inept mage, he held a grudge deep and dark that eventually caused a horrible scene years later.\n\nEven though the campaign was trite and very unoriginal, it was a fun first outing and still stands to teach the lesson: never under estimate the quiet ones.\n",

        "text": "[A continuing tale of my first Pathfinder character, Tarkov the drunken russian midget.](http://redd.it/2kyd7v) For those of you who weren't here last time, Tarkov and his merry fellows (At the moment consisting of a trigger-happy hobgoblin gunner, a suicidally optimistic calvalier, a pissy dragon sorceress, and a cowardly frogman cleric- wait, where the hell did we get a cleric?) had murdered their way out of an extradimensional rape-circus and then got caught in a DM fiat involving Sean Connery and a dragon that sent us all flying into a nigh-undiscovered floating nation-continent governed by a psionic empress. Wackiness ensued as the empress tried to figure out what to do with us, culminating in a pantsless Tarkov letting it slip that we'd come from another nation across the clouds. Tarkov and the pissy sorceress (in magic-negating manacles) were commanded to start telling the empress bedtime stories while the rest of the party was sentenced to go die in a gladitorial arena for her amusement.\n\nWhile Tarkov wove great tales of bullshit about his hometown (which he was oddly protective of, and never once mentioned its name) we started to learn a few things- like how the empress wasn't all THAT big of a bitch, and how her personal advisor seemed to be hiding something, and how the pissy sorceress's manacles didn't actually stop her from breathing fire from her dragon bloodline.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party found themselves in a giant network of holding cells that was hanging off the bottom of the island. The only way out was through the network of trams and railways, and nobody exactly had a map of the place, so they were stuck there for the time being. Luckily, the hobgoblin gunner was a bit of a machinist and used some nearby scrap metal to construct a flimsy replacement arm for our calvalier, who was surprisingly cheery about the whole getting dismembered thing.\n\nUpstairs, the plot was thickening. The empress was making preparations to set off to this wondrous new continent, in a vessel that they had recently stumbled upon- the party's airship from before they had been teleported to the hell-circus by Fester. Apparently it had just been floating towards here the whole time. We weren't exactly in a position to ask for it back, and the rest of the party was pretty deep in the murderprison, so we were kinda at a loss.\n\nBut, after having a little bit of a chat with some of the empress's entourage (which consisted of a silent rougish woman with wings, a massive rune giant, and a grouchy owl dude who was the empress's advisor) we learned something nefarious. After confronting the owl dude about his weird behavior- as well as where the hell you could find a decent drink around here- we learned two things: first, that the owl dude was plotting to overthrow the empress, and second, that vodka wasn't a thing on this continent. *GOD DAMMIT.*\n\nNow, despite the fact that it should have been a slam dunk decision, we were a bit iffy about overthrowing an entire nation just to bust our asses out of a bad situation. Plus, when the treacherous advisor is willing to stab one guy in the back, why not two? We decided to stall by haggling a little and seeing if the guy's plan had any real weight to it, but the paranoid bastard decided that it was too dangerous to be telling us these things and that we had to die.\n\nHe lasted about two rounds before the sorceress turned him into a festive holiday dinner.\n\nThe empress, of course, was pissed. We were promptly thrown into the dungeons and sentenced to fight and die in the arena (because apparently the excuse of \"He was dick!\" doesn't work no matter how high your charisma is). And with that, the party was reunited! I think the calvalier even got his horse back, and the hobgoblin gunner reunited his ridable murderchameleon. Yeah, he had a rideable murderchameleon. His name was Huggles, and he was awesome because he had a habit of eating people we didn't like.\n\nSpeaking of, we were thrown into several deadly arena matches in increasingly absurd scenarios. We fought a liquored-up hillbilly over a lake of lava, smacked down a bunch of mooks over a spacious void, and got press-ganged into a chariot race with some of our cellmates- we were directly competing against another chariot for the privilege of not being devoured by the murderous shoggoth that was chasing us. I mean, really, where the hell did they get a shoggoth? Anyway the NPC monk decided that fighting each other wasn't the way to go and ended that particular event by leaping into the shoggoth's mouth and tearing out several internal organs. We really liked that guy.\n\nThis all culminated with a smackdown on a goblin horde led by a bugbear. Tarkov had a chance to try out some of his new abilities- namely, [Greater shout](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shout), which he used to shatter the skulls of about 15 mooks at once, and [Animate Object](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-objects), which he used to turn a nearby bush into the poor man's [Black Tentacles](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/black-tentacles). And with that, the bugbear was immobilized and we were free to take our time and OH GOD THE CAVALIER'S CHARGING IN WHY I MEAN FOR CHRISSAKES WE HAVE A GUNNER RIGHT HERE WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT.\n\nSo yeah, he got impaled and lost his remaining arm. There's just no cure for stupid...\n\nGot that fucker's spear, though. Managed to stash it in my bag of holding (which the DM had put in my inventory as a gift to the party), somehow making room amongst about a metric ton of vodka. That was another plus side- being a gladiator means we had access to our old equipment, as it was cheaper than finding new weapons for us to fight with. The only downside is that they took it away before we got sent back to the cells. Still, at least Tarkov could be drunk while he was fighting.\n\nAnyway, we were all celebrating our glorious victory (minus the cavalier, who was in a coma) when the prison tram came in again. And they'd forgotten to shut the blast doors that are supposed to be between the guards and the prisoners.\n\nA few seconds later, we politely asked the only guard who WASN'T a small pile of ash if he could kindly organize a prison break.\n\nHalf an hour later, we were back in the throne room, dead set on stealing back our equipment as well as anything that wasn't nailed down. Unfortunately, the throne room was still occupied- not with the full entourage, just the rune giant. Apparently the doors weren't big enough for him to comfortably leave.\n\n...Excuse me, DM, but would you say those stone statues throughout the hall are gargantuan or Collosal? Just gargantuan, eh? Well, I ask because I have this spell...\n\n...And that's the story of how we murdered a rune giant five times our size with an animated statue, some screaming, lots of bullets and a duo of T-rexes. Poor bastard didn't stand a chance.\n\nTo be fair, though, we weren't entirely without mercy. Right after we caved his head in, we started feeling guilty about murdering a guy who was just doing his job (THE PRISON GUARDS DON'T COUNT, THEY WERE ONLY FIRST LEVEL) and we agreed to cast a [Raise Dead](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead) spell on him... after we found the treasury and pilfered a tidy sum of jewels, and our confiscated equips. It's almost as if booze is the source of all philanthropy.\n\nAnyway, we were on a roll, so we decided to go have a few words with empress. The other prisoners weren't feeling it, though, and decided to take their leave. Tarkov probably could have persuaded them to lend a hand, but, what the hell, they'd helped us with the prison break and the monk had torn apart a shoggoth, they earned it.\n\nThe fight with the empress took place in a weirdass shrine of some sort, which the empress had personally fortified. She'd set up forcewalls, was ready to mindblast us as we advanced, and even had her strix bodyguard around to harass us. It would have been a long and painful fight if not for three facts...\n\n* 1: Tarkov had recently acquired [Dimension Door](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door).\n* 2: The empress was sealed in a 15x15 box of force.\n* 3: Forcewalls reflect sound.\n\nTwo rounds later, the empress was bleeding from various parts of her face and had probably gone deaf permanently. Tarkov was taking hits from the empress's spells and a very pissed-off strix, but all of the attention on him had allowed the rest of the party to close in and surround her little box, and the cheeky little russian just ported right out again once things had gone south. We had her dead to rights, and she knew it. We signaled for her surrender, but it looked like she wanted to go down fighting...\n\nAnd at that moment, Sean fucking Connery made his entrance. RIDING THE GOLD DRAGON.\n\nBecause, see, while we had been lounging in the empress's pleasure resort, the implacable scotsman had buried the hatchet with the dragon and they decided to team up and do a little recon. They'd been scouring the city looking for two things- the airship that Sean was the captain of, and us, its crew.\n\nSay what you will about that glorious scottish bastard- he certainly has a sense for dramatic timing.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"The song of my people will make your ears bleed\", ABSENTEE FATHERS AND HITCHIKERS!](http://redd.it/2l50cg)",

We've got a fair few active members, but we are always going to welcome more, and we'd love to see people who are really into Dishonored join us, and have fun :) We currently have a fantastic community - everyone is really friendly, and keen about the sub. If you're not familiar with the lore, then beware, it gets pretty heavy below ;)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n \nThe gist of it is that there will be four factions you can join:\n \n* Royal Guard, formed after the ascension of Emily I, and led by Corvo\n \n* Daud's Assassins, led by the infamous murderer of Jessamine Kaldwin and star of the DLC\n \n* Brigmore Witches, led by Delilah, who avoided death at the hands of Daud and is now struggling to rebuild her shattered coven\n \n* The Abbey of the Everyman, led by the (not actually in game) High Overseer Luther, a man determined to restore the influence of the Abbey in these times of religious turmoil\n\n[HERE is some further information about the four factions](http://www.reddit.com/r/DishonoredRP/comments/2iwcf7/meta_character_sheets_and_powers/), as well as our brand new implemented faction system that we're very excited about, with possibility for character builds, upgrades, and the like - this is a flexible system, but there are rules! :) A useful way of balancing power strong factions with the weapon strong factions. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nIt assumes a low chaos (clean hands) run on the behalf of Corvo in the main game, and a high chaos one on Daud's part in the DLC (though Delilah is spared) - [follow this link for a more in depth history](http://www.reddit.com/r/DishonoredRP/comments/2i9xsu/history_up_until_now/).\n \nThere will be regular missions that you can apply for, events that affect everybody in the sub, there are bases where you can meet members of your own faction, and chances to explore the city of Dunwall (the primary location) itself.\n\nAll user suggestions are highly valued by me, and I always appreciate creative input - so feel free to get in touch.\n \nI'm the head mod, so I'll be the one approving your submissions, writing you missions, and otherwise guiding your hand in this rp subreddit! I'd advise reading over as many threads as you can, in order to get a feel of the universe we've tried to establish - there are already quite a few deep insights into the cultures of the various Isles of the Dishonored universe, including several of my own posts about the culture (and also language) of Serkonos. The aim is to make a gritty, realistic rp that people can enjoy.\n\n--------------\n\nWith regards to posts and character applications, take your time if you want, no rush :)\n\n------\n\nA sample of some of the stuff that has been written:\n\n* Several [one-shot type things](http://www.reddit.com/r/DishonoredRP/comments/2gmai8/tales_from_dunwall_and_elsewhere/), more as an area of fleshing out your character, or something in the universe in which you would like to explore in particular.\n\n* An example of one of the [missions](http://www.reddit.com/r/DishonoredRP/comments/2gegoz/night_raid_euron_and_claret/)\n\n----------------------------------------------\n \n[**Here is where you submit your character application** - hope it's easy to navigate for you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/DishonoredRP/comments/2g06vx/meta_new_application_thread/)\n \n[And here is just a little note to suggest a format for rp posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/DishonoredRP/comments/2fmwg2/meta_a_note_on_rp_posts/) - try and make them as detailed as you can, because some people have written absolutely incredible stuff, and we'd like to keep it that way if we can!\n\n------------------------------------------------\n \n\n\nIf you have any questions, please post them here, or send me a private message - up to you.

On top of that, we both have garbage surrounding land. We're playing tall fairly on purpose, but even founding a second city is a nightmare. I espy some nice real estate once I'm secure from barbarians - and Attila beats me to it, founding a craptastic little city A few blocks off from where I want it. I eventually settle on a little river just barely out of Athens' range to the north, our third city of the game, Sparta.\n\n[This is the turn of Sparta's Founding](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=335849969)\n\nSome notes on this situation: The settlers are exactly where Sparta will be founded. Off screen to the west, German settlers are being blocked from the only pass between Assyria and Maya (and indeed from the Southern portion of the Continent to the Eastern) by a Mayan Warrior. They eventually get through 'cause the AI doesn't capitalize on this. I unfortunately don't have another viable screenshot location until the events of next time.\n\nNot long after that, Attila decides subtlety and planning are for chumps. It's quite the army of horse archers and spearmen that roll up on my door. He doesn't declare war yet. Cool - I'll just keep churning out Hoplites and Composite Bowmen. He eventually does declare war. My military is superior in quality but vastly outnumbered. Only burning all of my excess gold on an extra Hoplite in defense of Sparta is able to save the little city and turn back the tide of Attila.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany vs. Maya. To say Germany had a completely unreasonably enormous military thanks to sacking barbarian encampments every few turns (Germany abiltiy: Furor Teutonicus - Chance to get a barbarian unit for free as a military unit every time he sacks an encampment) would still be understating it. The reason I could only afford to buy out one measly Hoplite is I was paying for that gobsmackingly huge standing army, since Athens far outstripped Berlin productively. Regardless, before he can even get to Attila, Bismarck has to go through whatsyerface of the Maya, who've already got three cities to his one. It doesn't go well for them. First their outlying southern city is capped and burnt to the ground in two turns. Then their capital on the coast, Palenque (I mention the name as it'll be important later) is captured.\n\n (It is around here the editor in me feels it worthwhile to note, he had already established the city of Hamburg past the Mayan line, in a spot north of either of those, and almost perfectly central to the entire continent. It contributed nothing to his war effort yet, since it couldn't produce military reasonably during this throwdown)\n\nOne last feeble Mayan city stands before Germany; its name lost to time due to being burnt to the ground despite its fantastic mountain defenses. The only thing left between him and me is Attila's Court. Technically, there is an overland route that that aforementioned obnoxious city of Douglas (the one that stole my sweet city-founding spot) complicates. I'm pushing back Attila - when all of a sudden Boudicca, who is doing far and away the best of anyone this game sweeps in on the border of Sparta. My troops can't get there for 5 turns. Even though it's nothing but Pictish Warriors and Archers, Sparta is doomed to fall. I accept this, and merely devote some troops to the Athenian border. I can't win the push for Sparta, but I'll be damned if they're going to destroy a single blade of grass in the HEAVILY improved Athenian territory. Seeing as I am in a seriously bad spot, it is agreed that Attila's Court shall become my new second city. By this point, catapults are just now entering the German army, in no small part due to the Mayans having thinned out a few Brutes from his absurd military. By this point, in fact, Germany's military has been reduced to a reasonable number of troops - a shell of its former self. Nonetheless, thanks to the AI's inability to target siege equipment worth a damn, Attila's Court falls, and is turned over to me.\n\nWe make peace with the Celts - for now. We want to finish off Attila, which is a short jaunt to burn two pathetic cities to the ground. In fact, that's really all there is to say about that. We mass troops once more on the border of Sparta, and retake the city with minimal effort after we declare war (once the truce is up, of course). Before the siege of Sparta is even over, Ashurbanipal of Assyria, who can be said to be doing as well as the Celts, declares war on us, and his troops sweep in on Palenque, stealing it from Germany's empire before it can even get properly integrated. Then, they march east. Then we actually catch sight of that huge Celtic army that was completely absent from Sparta - they're marching right past the recaptured city and on their way west. Those of you paying attention to your geography will have probably surmised their target. Especially when you hear that Catherine, Ashurbanipal's ally, marches south from her Frozen Throne Of The North.\n\nThey're all converging on Hamburg. Germany's only city besides distant, distant Berlin.\n\nNext Time on ~~Dragon Ball~~Greece and Germany: The Siege of Hamburg, aka. The Battle of Too Damn Many Armies.",

        "text": "This was a few years back, we were playing Hackmaster 4th ed in an ongoing campaign. Myself and another player's characters had just died the last game and were starting up new ones. I was playing a swashbuckler and my friend was a berserker.\n\nWe were in a new city and were trying to figure out what was going on with someone amassing artifacts. It was slow work and was taking us several days to gather information without drawing attention. Each day, the berserker was going outside the city to try to get into fights as berserkers take negatives each day they don't kill something. He had been completely unsuccessful as random encounters are rolled on a chart and he was rolling really low. \n\nAfter about five or six days we had finally found someone to go after. We arrived at a house in the middle of the city and the guy took to the roofs to run away. The berserker and I took off after the guy while the rest of the party fought the henchmen on the ground. \n\nWe made it to the roof just in time for ninjas to show up and start fighting us. The berserker got really excited as he was fighting at some major negatives at this point. Between the two of us we finished the ninjas pretty quickly and it was down to just the berserker and one last ninja. \n\nHe rolled a crit to hit the ninja, which triggered his bloodrage. His hit killed the ninja but wasn't enough to end his rage so he started coming after me. This wasn't that big of a deal because I had really high dex and my AC was very good. He could barely hit he and was doing decent but manageable damage. I was rolling really well and was doing massive damage to him, but berserkers are unable to fall while in a rage.\n\nSuch massive damage that I rolled a ctit to hit him at one point and extended his rage further. It was around this time that the rest of the party arrived on the roof. Two members ran up and helped engage the berserker. He made a roll and succeeded to be able to change targets to one of the rogues. \n\nHe rolled a 1 to hit her. \n\nThis caused him to drop his axe and do a surprising amount of damage (he had rolled a critical fumble). He ended up getting the effect of \"hit the nearest ally\" with his fumble. Guess who that was? \n\nHis fumble was enough damage to kill me in that one hit. \n\nHowever I got my revenge in the end as that hit was enough to satisfy his rage and he immediately died after his rage ended as I had taken him to negative 40 or so HP during our fight. \n\nThe party ended up paying to have me resurrected but it was unanimously voted that the berserker could stay dead as that's what he deserved.

        "text": "[A continuing tale of my first Pathfinder character, Tarkov the Drunken Russian Midget.](http://redd.it/2kxcbs) For those of you who weren't here last time, Tarkov is a gnome bard who speaks with an atrocious russian accent and yells at people. He wound up in the fantastic Cirque du Necrophil, where the wonders never cease and everything wants to kill/rape/eat you, and made fast friends with a hobgoblin gunner and his merry band of murderhobos (consisting of an incredibly unlucky calvalier, a pissy dragon sorceress, and a ninja who apparently fell into a plot hole and never emerged).\n\nIt seems that when Tarkov joined the group, they were in the middle of carving a bloody swathe through the \"festivities\" in true adventurer fashion, and Tarkov was only getting the tail end of it. Not that he cared. The endless supply of twisted monstrosities and rape-clowns was either a sign that Tarkov was drinking to the point of hallucination, or the DM was. Still on the fence about that one.\n\nAnyway, it turns out the hell-circus was run by a creepy-ass demigod jester named [Fester](http://i.imgur.com/K8g8ulp.png), and this was his own personal plane. Fester was a fun guy, lemme tell ya- the way he wore human skin and limbs like carnival clothes, how he would switch between laughing at atrocities and being downright sanctimonious, he was just the LIFE of the party. Tarkov still wasn't sure if he was hallucinating this, but either way he decided he would like to pop that creepy little bastard's head like an egg, and then piss on the corpse. And even then, there was the possibility that the creepy little shit would get off on it.\n\nSo after a few minibosses (which mostly consisted of spamming sonic attacks, magic missile, regular missile, and sword to the face) we finally got to the main chamber and had a showdown with Fester. The calvalier, finding his precious horse mount hanging from a ceiling by meathooks, charged in with the frenzy of the righteous/terminally stupid. Having no real choice, we followed him so that we were nice and close when a meathook on a spiked chain whipped down from the ceiling and tore off his shield arm.\n\nWe managed to keep him alive through the loss of his only real girlfriend, and made enough of a dent on Fester that we thought we were pretty hot shit. But to the surprise of absolutely no one, it turns out that evil demigods are practically immortal on their home plane, and Fester was just screwing with us. Possibly literally.\n\nFortunately, at that moment, our climactic slapfest was interrupted by the arrival of Sean Connery. Well, maybe not Sean Connery in the strictest sense, but for all intents and purposes it was- a balding scottish man with a fez and a tendecy to shpeak in a shuave manner, my boy. At the time, the glorious scottish badass was having a smackdown with a gold dragon, and was apparently wreaking so much havok in doing so that he had punched into this demiplane by mistake.\n\nLong story short, a four-way shitstorm was narrowly averted by a complete dimensional fustercluck, and the party was sucked into a negative space wedgie and depositied right into the middle of a bunch of VERY heavily armed and VERY irate soldiers who wanted to know just why we had popped out of nowhere, and flown ass-first into the face of their captian. Needless to say, we were still sore after our fight and were promptly arrested for... being PCs, I guess.\n\nWe were brought to the empress of the area, and she was the one to decide what to do with all of us. The party tried to explain that they just explorers who had lost their flying ship, which they were using to chart the sea of clouds and had only ended up here by coincidence. Tarkov was reminded of his home, a small settlement on the floating continent of Nuvo, which was pretty much the only inhabited place in the world (as far as anyone knew). His particular home country/cavern was a freezing cold wasteland, and Tarkov had set out on an epic journey to find something to keep his town's nards from freezing off. And then he had gotten a job as a bartender on an airship that was going to explore the infinite isles, and then shit went south and either someone had spiked his vodka or he had gotten in a pissing contest with a particularly rapey demigod.\n\nAnd now a bunch of nancy boy soldiers had taken his booze.\n\nHe wasn't a very happy camper, is what I'm saying.\n\nSo throughout the various judgements being handed down by the empress (which basically amounted to \"I don't know, throw them in the gladiatorial arena or something, I'm busy\") Tarkov was constantly finding fault with everything the empress was doing. For example, the cavalier would be better suited to physical labor or press-ganged into the local military, but they were just going to throw him in a pit to die pointlessly? I mean, come on, talk about a waste of resources.\n\nAfter about the second sentencing (in which our pissy dragon sorceress obstinately refused to be sent into the empress's personal harem, much to everyone's disappointment) the empress was starting to get rather annoyed with the screaming idiot. However, because he was screaming with Charisma 20^tm she was also a bit amused and sentenced him to be the new court jester.\n\nTarkov was actually very pleased with this decision, as it allowed him to put on something warm (if a bit jingly) and continue making fun of everything the empress did. But alas, the empress got tired of his drunken ramblings and told him to shut his damn boozehole. Tarkov argued that he was becoming distressingly sober, because *someone* had taken away all of his booze, and maybe if he could go take a hit off that massive hookah near all those concubines he might be a bit less pissy.\n\nOne successful diplomacy roll later, Tarkov was getting good and fucked (in many senses) while everyone else was getting screwed over (in less pleasant senses). But, all good things must come to an end, and the whiny adventurers were making a fuss about their effective death sentences and started a scuffle with the empress's bodyguard. PC senses tingling, Tarkov immediately jangled onto the scene to assist, only to be met with a roomful of stares.\n\nYou see, Tarkov had been conducting some, *ahem*, business with the ladies of the harem and had neglected to take stock of his entire wardrobe. Thinking quickly, he said the first thing that came to mind.\n\n\"In my country, this is compliment.\"\n\nWhat surprising was that *this worked*. The empress's attention was now fully on the stoned, pantsless idiot who had just offhandedly revealed the existence of other nations. The rest of the party was dismissed (by way of a bit of psionic mindrape and a handy group of soldiers) while the empress decided to have a chat with Tarkov and the pissy dragon sorceress (who had talked her way into being a personal attendant at the cost of wearing magic-negating bracelets).\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"What the hell did I do last night\", SHOGGOTH SHOWDOWNS AND FLASH-FRIED PERSONAL ADVISORS!](http://redd.it/2l1a6n)",

        "text": "Gather round, children, and let me tell you of my very first time playing a tabletop RPG.\nI've always been an avid gamer, and when a friend offered to let me into a D&amp;D session of his, I jumped at the chance. We chatted for a while and I came up with my very first character.\n\nUnfortunately he was vetoed because he was a dwarf named General Slappy Pants and his only worthwhile skill was punching people in the groin. But my second character was better received- A gnomish bard by the name of Tarkov.\n\nTarkov was a drunk. But he was a gnomish drunk, so he could get away with it. He was also the most offensive russian stereotype I could come up with. He was surly, rude, hit on any female he could see, screamed a lot, and would kill anyone who touched his precious vodka.\n\nI was thrown into the game at an astonishingly high level (around 15) where most of the party had a well-established role and knew how to handle themselves. Tarkov had not bothered to choose spells and feats that would compliment his abilities, just his personality- his main focus was screaming, hitting things, and screaming in a slightly different manner. His first action in the game was to punch a zombie in its dumbass face. Tarkov being a gnome with the strength of 8, this went about as well as you'd expect.\n\nAfter the party had successfully bailed him out of being swarmed by midget clown zombies, we went for a lovely stroll into a nightmarish hell-circus that took every possible opportunity to horrify us. The rest of the party were seasoned adventurers, and weren't particularly ruffled- Tarkov, on the other hand, was simply too drunk to care. When one encounter ended with each of us in a separate set of rooms, Tarkov was only really disappointed because he wouldn't be able to check out the hot dragon sorcerer's ass anymore.\n\nAfter that was my first real combat encounter. While taking a swig from his prodigious vodka stash, he stumbled upon a bit of the floor that opened into a gaping mouth and tried to eat him. Tarkov, well-practiced at keeping his footing on a heaving floor, dodged it without thinking and proceeded to open up the door to the next room. In there was a freak of nature that bore a frankly plagiaristic resemblance to [a certain monster that doesn't like being looked at.](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096) True to form, it started screaming and tried to hide its face from Tarkov, who was in the act of chastising it for being a \"fucking sissy\". This was apparently the wrong thing to say.\n\nI was, of course, hilariously outclassed. I had no backup, no combat skills of note, and no spells damaging enough to bring it down. Tarkov was grappled and slapped around like a rag doll in less than a round. But Tarkov wasn't about to lie down and die, he had too much vodka still to drink! So, thinking quickly, he paged through his spell list and found something that might be suitable. He found [Jester's Jaunt,](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/j/jester-s-jaunt) and used it to teleport the freak of nature into the room with a gaping mouth in it. Unfortunately, the spell could not put the freak into the mouth, or release Tarkov from the creature's grip.\n\nThinking quickly, Tarkov found another spell that was just right for the occasion: [Mad Monkeys.](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mad-monkeys) Within moments, the room had been filled to the brim with the screeching little bastards, and once grapple check later, the freak was now the one getting an impromptu cavity search.\n\nThe roll to convince the monkeys to leap into the mouth-pit was very satisfying. It was probably overkill to scream bloody murder at it, throw acid flasks into its face and shoot it with a small crossbow.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party was having some fun with an exhibitionist clown and a succubus who had ensnared our only melee fighter (which was only the second-worst woman-related experience he had endured). Then the gunner opened the door into my little slice of real estate to see if I needed assistance, he was pleasantly surprised to find that the ragged midget ranting about how he'd gotten monkey poo all over his awesome winter coat was packing a Cure Serious Wounds spell.\n\nWe, of course, pooled our efforts and steamrolled through the rest of the rooms, flinging bullets and insults at whatever came our way. We were a bit disappointed when the boss of the area turned out to be immune to projectiles and sonic attacks (by way of being a demonic mime), but hey, his flunkies weren't. I sent one of those bastards crying home to mommy with self-esteem issues.\n\nGood times. I miss that crazy gunner.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"I'm not drunk enough for this shit\", MEETING THE MANAGEMENT AND THE MANY APPLICATIONS OF SCREAMING!](http://redd.it/2kyd7v)",

        "text": "One of my greatest memories in college was meeting many friends whom I still consider with me to this day. I was living in the middle of buttfucknowhere PA and still suffering through dial-up internet speeds but one of my friends introduced me to an anime called Naruto.We would download it while at school and then drop the newest episodes on the school's shared drive and then talk about how much we loved the series non-stop while out of class.\n\nOne day one of my circle of friends discovered a homebrew of Naruto called [Naruto d20](http://www.narutod20.com/) that basically uses an open gaming license for a spin on d20 modern set in the Naruto world with everyone taking on the role of ninjas.\n\nNeedless to say, my circle of friends were extremely excited about this prospect and quickly roped a guy named Steve into DM'ing it. We all rolled up characters (I'm hoping that /u/razzazzika and /u/CleverGirlwithadd will chime in with some stories from this campaign as well) and got to playing monthly. I rolled up a Uchiha clan member, building toward getting my Mangekyo Sharingan (basically eye powers that do crazy shit) but he also, like all my gaming characters, has a particular fascination with explosives and poisons.\n\nSo we're playing the game participating in the Chuunin exam (in the Naruto world, these are the exams that determine if you can advance in the ninja ranking system) and just like in the series (as in Steve basically ripped off the entire end of the Chuunin Exam arc in the anime/manga), the exams are interrupted and our village is attacked.\n\nAs the higher ranking ninjas are all fending off the attack, one of the village elders approaches us and tells us they have received intel that target of this attack is the village treasury and we're tasked to defend it. Steve tells us we have 10 minutes to prepare for the treasury attack and to set up defenses and traps as we see fit.\n\nSo the rest of the party begins figuring out how to position themselves secretly and hide, waiting for the ambush while I took a more proactive approach: Using garotte wire, I strung a spider web along the ceiling of the treasury and dangled down from it [Explosive Notes](http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii199/reardonruler/ExplodingNoteCard.jpg) and clay balls filled with poisons. I positioned myself along the catwalk ready to bring the web down as soon as an enemy entered.\n\nThe enemies arrive and the party engages them outside of the treasury. Every time my turn comes up, I pass on it, still waiting for someone to be stupid to enter. This went on for about 3 turns when I asked Steve for a layout of outlying area which including a small tree farm where this battle was raging.\n\nI used an ability called *Bunshin no Jutsu* to create a clone on the catwalk, and rolled a nat 20 on a stealth check to carefully sneak outside into the trees and strung up another (but less impressive looking) spiderweb of poisons and booms. After two turns of setting it up, I jumped down from my perch, throwing a [kunai](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100502203256/naruto/images/thumb/e/e2/Hidden_Kunai.jpg/500px-Hidden_Kunai.jpg) into the trees, bringing the web down on the enemies. The resulting chaos left a small crater where the trees were and a poisonous gas cloud that now hovered around the battlefield which Steve moved each round depending on the direction of the wind!\n\nAfter a successful victory, I dispelled my clone and we prepared to celebrate when we heard sounds from inside the treasury. I convinced /u/CleverGirlwithadd to enter the treasury through the window I used and bring the web down on whatever enemies that had gotten past us. She did so, and brought the treasury down **WITH** the web!\n\nNow, whenever I game I always make it a point to boost the ever living crap out of my bluff check. I love roleplaying and it allows me to probably rp more than any other situations. The village elders approached the remains of what once was the village treasury to determine what happened. One successful bluff check later, I was rewarded for successfully defending the village, while my teammates had their pay taken to cover repairs.\n\nmy hope is that /u/CleverGirlwithadd will follow this up with another story from this campaign which I can subtitle as \"this is the first time you've roleplayed? don't piss off the DM\"\n\nthanks for reading!",

Sadly, the second card screws me; I lose all equipment and gold (major irony). But the third card is where I almost walk out.\n\nI must face Death...as a level 1...with no equipment....Yeah.\n\nSo, after making a new character (I basically make the same character with different stats), I decide to pull one more card from the deck (like I said, I'm a bit of a compulsive gambler). Wouldn't you know it, I get to roll a D4 to determine how many wishes I get. Well, I roll a 4. Sweet, there are 4 of us playing and I'm feeling generous.\n\nWell, everyone wishes for various assorted things (ability to change size, ability to shoot eye lasers, etc) except me. I wish for every negative card to be taken out of the Deck of Many Things. DM allows it.\n\nSo, we decide to split up the deck between us. I recieve 3 cards.\n\nFirst, I recieve a level 1 rogue follower. Second, I recieve 20 jewelry pieces worth 50 gold each. But the third...the third is when the wheels in my head start to turn.\n\nMy next (first) kill will be a 1 hit kill. And I will auto level up to the next level upon killing him, as well as receiving the XP from the kill.\n\nSo, one of my friends has a treasure map. We decide to follow it and find out where it leads. We follow it, and finally come to the place where the treasure is. Along this time, I haven't had to fight any enemies due to my friends managing to kill them all first.\n\nAnyway, in the treasure chamber, what should appear but a level 5 Greater Pit Fiend.\n\nI manage to role highest for initiative.\n\nI got this.\n\nI don't even need to role to see if the attack hits.\n\n1 hit insta kill.\n\nLevel up to level 6.\n\nIn the span of 10 minutes, I went from my own gambling destroying my first character before we'd even started playing, to defeating a Greater Pit Fiend with 1 hit and getting level 6.

In character just trying to stay alive, out of character I'll do everything I can to sabotage the party while still RPing my character.  Party likes him enough to keep him around, who doesn't like to eat?\n\nParty designates him as the scout because nobody could be bothered to put a rank into spot or listen.

Party walks in like they're big shit. Army of 100+ spots the party. Kinder won't let them leave Clout behind. She's good people. \n\nParty tried to dump Clout at every chance.

Gully Dwarves don't want him, he's reckless sticking with adventurers and possibly plague infested. Clout cries a little, party feels bad and lets him tag along still. \n\nParty finds out about a local vampire who's turning lots of people. Clout doesn't want to die, but the party insists on going to fight it. Hears them talking about how vampires are really hard to kill and turn you with a bite. In the middle of the night, Clout sneaks out to find the vampire lair. Finds the vampire and tells him he'll give him info about the two adventurers coming to get him if he bites him. Vamp agrees, so he tells him about the Dragon Rider and the Psion and gets cut off before he can talk about the rest. He only knew about two, right? Vamp bites him, blood tastes like cat piss. Party kills the vamp next day. Clout stays behind, after less than a day of being a vampire spawn and is now a full blown vampire. He uses a garbage can as a coffin and spends his time biting rats and other small animals. Maybe the occasional Kobald. Clout lives forever since he's not threatening enough to attract other adventurers. He's afraid of the sun though. ",

        "author": "TheXenophobe",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ksll8/mount_and_blade_warband_gekokujo_mod_a_thousand/",
        "text": "To start this off, I need to give some background on the character name, as its from something I created far prior to playing Gekokujo and it is not a japanese name. The Character's name is Cora, it is based on a character I created in an MMO who has become my all time favorite character, so every time I make a new female character, I simply try to remake her. It based on halfling naming conventions (The OG Cora is a halfling duelist who was given the title Shadowhand) and has nothing to do with Legend of Korra (not that I dislike the show I simply have never seen it).\n\nHer father was a samurai, or at least thats what he had told her. Little Cora believed her family was of noble heritage and that she lived in squalor to build her up so she knew how to rule. Her father often told her of the great clan house with the Black Hand adorning the walls. The mark of the Shadowhand, called it. \n\nHe told her that every samurai must respect their weapon, in every way, and so he made Cora become an assistant to the assistants of a local sword maker. The sword maker told her she was not allowed to help craft the blade because a woman's touch would weaken it. So she grew clever.\n\nShe noticed one of the boys beginning to take an interest in girls around the town, and would frequently tell the other boys about dates. On these dates the boy would be gone all day, so the sword maker would send for a boy off the street and have him do rudimentary work.\n\nCora caught on fast enough, and began appearing on days the boy was out dressed as a boy. She picked up on the trade fast enough, and eventually the new boy replaced the old boy. No one asked what happened to Cora.\n\nAfter several years she grew tired of playing the helper. She set things up in such a way that the forge pit wouldnt be completely dead when the sword maker left, and could be set up to forge easily.\n\nShe looked through the rejected blades that were going to be melted down and reforged, refolded and rehammered. She found one that had made it to the right length, and started working on it. Unfortunately she hadnt taken into account how much the swordsmith needed the helpers and it took her until well into the morning.\n\nShe had just finished quenching it when the swordsmith came into the workshop. She did the only thing she could, grab the sword and ran. As Cora left the mountain town, she realized that her father had not come to check on her at all after he sent her away.\n\nShe asked around among the travelers on the roads if they had heard of the Shadowhand, and eventually a lady in a carriage giggled, and said she had heard of such a thing. Her husband had mentioned that it was a popular myth among his ashigaru. The Clan they would one day form. \n\n\"poor girl, shoulders and muscle such that no man will want you as a bride, and no home or clan, just a lying father. You may as well just take a spot with my servants. Its the best your life will get.\"\n\nCora felt crushed. Everything she had been told was a lie, and her father was simply a soldier in a lords army, most likely dead too. With no home and no family, she stuck closely to the roads and spent a lot of time practicing the movements her father had taught her before she became a swordsmith's assistant. \n\nIt was different with a sword in hand. Everything was faster, yet harder to control. It was clear this was an instrument of death. Eventually the road she was following stopped at a city. Cora decided that a city may be the opportunity to reinvent herself that she's needed. As if by divine destiny, that was exactly what she got.\n\n(OOC: Actual Gameplay starts here)\n\nCora had arrived just before sundown, and for a young woman in feudal japan, this was not the time to be starting to wander. Darkness quickly descended and most people rushed past her on the street. Almost all at once, the town was dead quiet.\n\n\"I like that blade there, I bet it will fetch a nice price.\" A man stepped out of the shadows. He was in his prime, and had in his hands a large wooden club. The gleen in his eye and his weapon made it excessively clear what was about to happen. Cora removed the hastily crafted linen sheath from her Katana.\n\nThe man laughed and rushed her. Cora noted that everything seemed to be slowing down, and her body was making the movements her father had taught her. To Cora it seemed she was no longer in control. \n\n\"*Pull with the left hand, push with the right, watch your feet, win the fight*\" her father's 'samurai nursery rhyme' rang in her ears.\n\nThe club hung in the air above her. a quick step back and she watched it fall where she had stood. A lung forward and a quick strike is all it took. The man had attacked her wearing nothing but linens, and the diagonal cut was quickly draining him of all blood. \n\nCora watched as he pleaded with anything that he could. She wanted to feel disgusted that she had taken a life, but more than anything, she was disappointed that this wasn't the case. *Maybe I'm not what I thought I was...* She though as his eyes drifted off, clearly no longer under any sort of control.\n\nA door slid open, and a man in exotic furs with a plump belly carefully surveyed the scene, before stepping out.\n\n\"Miss, we must get you away from here. Japan isnt friendly to women, especially not women who kill men.\"\n\nSilently she followed him to a building on the edge of town. Where they stepped inside. \"This is my home. Your little duel happened right in front of my store, and frankly I cant thank you enough. His body means less muggings for fear of ending up the same way. Oh where are my manners, I am Taichi, whats your name?\"\n\n\"Big one? Your parents had some foresight. I am not so lucky. My father broke convention and named me Cora. It has no meaning.\"\n\n\"They gave you a chance to give it meaning, maybe? Anyways, you seem to be able to handle your katana, and my brother has been taken ransom. With all the sword trained men out in battle for the Great Lord Nanbu, you may be my only choice. I need someone to assemble a party to get my brother back. They are keeping him in a monastery they have taken over.\"\n\n\"Why should I care?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm the reason you arent rotting in a dungeon or worse. So for starters, you owe me. And I will to the Great Lord on your behalf, get him to see your side of the fight. Lastly, and this is the part I think you'll like best...\"\n\nHe steps into the other room and reappears holding black bamboo scabbard. \"I will give you my saya. I used to have a blade like yours, but it was flimsy and fragile, so I sold it as a training sword, but the saya was beautiful so I kept that.\"\n\nCora walked up to him, snatched the saya from his hand and immediately slid the katana in. It fit perfectly. She sighed. \"I'll do it. But what men would follow me?\"\n\nthe merchant, surprisingly calm responded, \"The kind you pay. I forgot to mention I would assist you in paying for the first five or so men you recruited. If you need more yen, go see about helping people train for the tournaments in the dojo up the hill. More might join you if they see you can fight.\"\n\n\"Tournament?\" Cora's eyes lit up.\n\n\"Calm yourself. Great Lord Nanbu holds a tournament at the dojo whenever he holds a feast. He also participates in it. While there are a couple women in each tournament they dont accept just any woman. The Sensei must recommend them for the tournament.\"\n\nUndeterred, Corra asks \"Where is this Sensei?\"\n\n\"He's at his Dojo, but you should head out in the morning, after you get some rest. Wouldnt want you to be weary when you need to be at your best for the Sensei. Once he says no, he doesn't change his mind. The tournament will be going until the end of the week, and my brother's kidnappers gave me 3 weeks to get the money, so we have time for you to participate.\"\n\n\"Good, because that's exactly what I'm going to do.\"",

        "text": "Moving right along, I thought I'd follow up with Chapter II of my new Call of Cthulhu campaign. This is our second session of *Tatters of the King*, which we played last Wednesday. We're playing again tonight, so if anyone's interested I'll post Chapter 3 and beyond. The campaign is *really* good, and I love my players, so hopefully it shapes up into some pretty compelling stuff.\n\n[Chapter I is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2kk69t/tatters_of_the_king_chapter_i_opening_night/), in case you missed it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nBack at Fagan's mansion, Tirol related the contents of the letter to his new friends (with the exception of Clay, who had deadlines to meet for a few different publications). Sensing an opportunity to finally build some contacts in London, he pitched the whole affair as a fine adventure, appealing to the others for their social companionship and professional skill in aiding the mysterious Dr. Highsmith. The others found the whole concept positively thrilling - there was talk of mental asylums and madmen, and even a murder, and everyone in attendance agreed the possibilities were thrilling. Besides, added Fagan, who was still having trouble shaking the play from his mind, they had all clearly experienced something strange and, perhaps, wonderful together, and surely it would behoove them to get to know one another a bit better. The young lord invited the entire group to stay at the estate for a few days, while they looked into *The King In Yellow* and prepared for Tirol's interview with Dr. Highsmith, set for ten days later.\n\n--------------------------\n\nSitting up almost until sunrise that night, Valencia finished the original copy of *The King In Yellow* that Thomas had pilfered from Estus' apartment. She dreamed again, when sleep finally took her - this time, she was in a boat on a misty gray lake, watching colossal, monstrous shapes drift along far below the surface. After a time, one breached the water, heading straight for her little boat. At the last second, she jumped clear, not knowing what awaited in the lake below... and woke up, once again drenched in a cold sweat.\n\nUnnerved but enchanted by the work itself and the dreams it had inspired, Valencia urged Fagan (the only other French speaker in the group) to read the play for himself. He took to it eagerly, still entranced by the adaptation it had inspired, and barely came out of his room for the next two days, insisting all meals be delivered to him until he could finish reading - no, more than that - *comprehending* - the play. He dreamed, too - dreamed of lost love and beautiful dead maidens, and of a great falconer named Hastur, at once wonderful and terrible to behold. The name was on his lips when he awoke - *Hastur* - and lingered in the back of his mind for days afterward.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nNow determined to know more about the play's origin - to have some clue as to its *meaning* - Fagan dressed, found Enzo to accompany him, and took a car into the city, to Talbot Estus' apartments.\n\nThe playwright was in a state when they found him, tearing his chambers apart in his futile search for the stolen book. If he had slept at all since they'd last left him, he didn't show it. He was so happy to have it returned to him that he didn't seem particularly interested in where Fagan had \"found\" it - though he was eager to compare notes on the play itself. The two talked for a time before Fagan and Enzo left, now with a manuscript copy of Estus' most recent novel, also inspired by *The King In Yellow*. Valencia read the book that night and the following day, and while in it Estus threw around words like \"Hali\" and \"Cassilda,\" ultimately she dismissed it as literary garbage - a pale, poorly-executed first attempt at the themes that had made Estus' play seem so... what? Beautiful? Terrible? *Important*?\n\n-------------------------------\n\nEventually, the day of the interview came round, and Dr. Tirol went to meet Dr. Highsmith at the Great Western Hotel. As uncouth as the other Americans were, it seemed prudent to leave Thomas to the task at hand - directing a team of landscapers in the transformation of the Fagan grounds - and to have Enzo take a seat in the hotel lounge and watch the meeting from a distance. This left Tirol, Fagan and Valencia to deal with the meeting itself.\n\nThe picture of professionalism, Highsmith came down from his room promptly, introduced himself, offered tea to his new acquaintances, and launched straight into his problem. A patient named Alexander Roby had been interred at Highsmith's asylum, St. Agnes' Home for the Deranged, for nearly two years, and soon it would be time to review Roby's case and see if he was fit for release. Alexander had been committed shortly after the brutal murders of his father and sister, an incident in which he had briefly been suspected, but in which no arrests were ever made. Highsmith explained that he believed Roby treatable and, indeed, close to wellness - but that the patient's family doctor, apparently on orders from the family, was insisting Alexander should remain incarcerated. Coming to the end of his tale, and his cup of tea, Highsmith asked if Tirol - and his associates, if they'd like - would look into the circumstances surrounding the case, and try to get to the bottom of the family's resistance to Alexander's release.\n\nTirol agreed it sounded like a fascinating case, and said he'd be glad to look into it. Highsmith seemed pleased, and offered to bring the group back to the asylum with him when he left two days hence, to meet Alexander and begin their work on his case. Agreements were made, hands were shaken, and the good doctor returned to his room. As the investigators exited, filling Enzo in on the details, Valencia expressed a strong belief that Highsmith had some motivation he wasn't sharing, but precisely what that motivation was would have to be a question for another time.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe next day, the group split up, to gather as much information as they could before their train journey to the asylum. Thomas and Dr. Tirol headed to the library and spent hours poring over newspaper clippings, trying to find anything they could about the murders of Roby's family and ultimately turning up a news item and an obituary. Meanwhile, Fagan, Enzo and Valencia returned to Estus again, to return his manuscript - and so the aristocrat could further feed his obsession with Estus' play and its sources. Pumping the crazed playwright for related readings, Fagan managed to convince Estus to lend out his copy of another book related to Hali and Carcosa: *Der Wanderer Durch Den See*, a disjointed book of poetry written half in German and half in English, whose author was identified only with the letters A.R. Of course the initials immediately made Fagan think of Roby, and he gratefully accepted the volume, wondering what the parallel was, if any.\n\nThe trio rejoined their companions at the library, then, and the whole group headed to the police station to find out more about the Roby case. The PC on duty (Police Constable, not Player Character!) told the would-be sleuths that, regretfully, he wasn't permitted to discuss cases with civilians... but with a bit of the soft touch from charming Lord Fagan, he did come through with the name of the funeral home that handled the family's arrangements. And, just like, that, Fagan &amp; Co. had their next destination...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*NEXT: A Meeting with a Madman!*",

        "text": "Started a new Call of Cthulhu campaign a couple weeks ago: the twisted and super well-regarded **Tatters of the King**. \n\nThe following can also be found in blog form over at yog-sothoth.com, but I thought I'd put Chapter One here and see if there's any interest in our ongoing adventures. Enjoy!\n\n----------------------------\n\nIt's September 1928. **Doctor Kellan Tirol** is a somewhat celebrated scholar in the relatively young field of Psychoanalysis. Originally from Baltimore, he decided to take an indefinite sabbatical abroad after a patient's grisly suicide (hence his 40 starting SAN, the lowest in the party). He currently resides in London, but without much in the way of companionship or entertainment, so when a flyer for a local theatre production - *Carcosa, or, The Queen &amp; The Stranger* - was stuffed into his mailbox, he saw no reason not to go.\n\nMeanwhile, the young **Lord Sebastian Fagan** is entertaining a few guests, also Americans. He sent for **Enzo Alessandro**, a slightly disreputable business partner from the States, to discuss entertaining new ventures to wager his late parents' fortune on. Along with Alessandro is **Thomas Monroe**, a New York architect of some repute, whom Fagan wishes to hire to design a brand-new, impossibly opulent estate. Eager to impress and entertain the Americans but not as cultured as he lets on, Fagan jumped to \"treat\" his guests to the first production he saw a poster for - of course, it was *Carcosa*.\n\nWaiting in line outside the play, Tirol met Fagan, Alessandro and Monroe, as well as **Clay Morgan**, an illustrator for weird fiction magazines, and **Valencia Chambers**, a playwright with a preoccupation with the occult. Both had come based on the theatrical posters' weird imagery - and the sinister, fascinated dread the play's title gave them, for reasons they couldn't put their finger on. As luck would have it, all of our would-be Investigators were seated next to one another, in the same row.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThe play was... strange. The production was well-staged but amateurish, and the script was all over the place - but also fascinating. Certain words or phrases stood out, pulled at them like old memories. The angles of the scenery somehow seemed *off*, but always just for a moment - a trick of the light. At the climax of the first act, the white-masked Stranger threw back his arms and let his robe part in front, revealing the [Yellow Sign](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130224004921/villains/images/5/50/The_Yellow_Sign.JPG) painted on his bare, flabby chest (SAN roll for the whole theater). The audience let out gasps and screams, and then it was intermission.\n\nDuring the act break, the new acquaintances argued their impressions of the play so far. Enzo was baffled at a scene where the Queen and Stranger just stood onstage in silence for unbroken minutes; the others maintained this had never happened and, had it, they would have remembered. Overall, the party's opinions on the play were just about evenly split, but Fagan in particular was quite taken with what they'd seen so far, spouting praise from the time the house lights came up until the curtain opened for the second act.\n\nIf the first act was disjointed, the second was an orgy of weirdness. The scenes didn't even feel loosely connected to one another anymore, the characters seemed to switch roles and finish each others' lines without warning, and the basic facts of the plot seemed to change minute to minute. The final scene, a chaotic masquerade in which the sinister and gigantic (and sloppily-costumed) King In Yellow makes an appearance and the city is revealed to have become Carcosa, was almost completely incoherent. Yet when the show ended, the audience's reaction was... well, visceral would be an understatement.\n\nSeveral men rushed the stage, screaming madly, and were put down by surprisingly spry ushers. Miss Chambers rushed to the aid of a woman being strangled by what was a moment ago her loving husband, while Clay Morgan threw down fisticuffs with a well-dressed gentleman in the next row who turned and punched him in the nose unprovoked.\n\nLord Fagan and the three Americans, meanwhile, were dodging scuffles and heading straight for the exit when they noticed an after-show reception being set up by theater staff. The chaos seemed to be dying down, and Fagan in particular was quite keen to talk to the playwright, so they decided to stay for a drink, and were joined presently by Valencia, and soon after by Morgan, now doubled over and wheezing, his nose bloodied.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThe cast and crew came out to join their fans soon. The actors were shocked and a little upset at the chaos following the show, but Talbot Estus, the playwright, seemed downright pleased that his script had worked the audience into such a fervor. Once they got him talking it was hard to get him to stop, and he went on at length about his various works. He was especially happy to talk about the source material, *The King In Yellow*, and (Credit Rating roll) even invited the party to visit him the next day, to see the original and discuss the work. Throughout the conversation he seemed overly excited, even agitated, and would periodically excuse himself, head straight for the nearest door, and look up at the sky nervously.\n\nMonroe and Morgan both tried chatting up one of the female leads, but - just as she started to open up about the strange dreams she'd been having since first reading the play - a few uncouth comments from Monroe had her shoving past the men, red-faced, and cursing over her shoulder at them as she headed for the dressing room.\n\nA bit dejected, they picked up their pride and went to their respective homes, all agreeing to see each other the next day at Estus' house for lunch.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe playwright was happy to receive his admiring visitors the following day, and had lunch and tea ready in his dingy walk-up apartment. Again, he was happy to talk about his own work and *The King In Yellow* and didn't seem interested in much else, though he also gushed about another book, *Der Wanderer durch den See*, when Valencia noticed it while perusing his collection. \n\nThe PCs had all argued at length at this point about certain sections of the play, and found major discrepancies in their accounts, almost as if they had been watching different plays at certain points. Insatiably curious, they all wanted an excuse to look at Estus' script, and Enzo casually asked what it would take for Estus to sell the performing rights if someone else wanted to put the play on. Fagan siezed on the idea, desperate to revisit the work, but this was evidently the wrong thing to say to Estus (who, remember, has 0 SAN). Leaping from his chair, he screamed at length about *his* right to perform *his* own play and rushed the investigators out the door - but not before Monroe swiped the copy of *The King In Yellow* from the playwright's bookshelf.\n\nDinner and drinks followed at Fagan's mansion just outside the city. Sleepy with drink, the new friends all agreed to stay for the night, and each was given a guest bedroom (Enzo and Monroe have slightly more permanent accomodations). Miss Valencia Chambers, who knows some French, sat up in an armchair by the fireplace with the little black book, *The King In Yellow*, reading, studying - fascinated. She intended to stay up all night reading it, but must have dozed at some point, because suddenly she found herself in a dream, chasing herself down a hallway, wielding a sword and a torch, wearing tattered yellow robes. She had herself cornered when she awoke, suddenly, drenched in sweat and sitting stock-straight in the armchair by the fireplace.\n\nClay Morgan dreamed, too - dreamed he was playing violin, part of a vast orchestra where every instrument seemed to be playing its own tune. Reeling from the cacophony, he looked desperately down at his own music - and saw only the Yellow Sign. Resigned, he drew back his bow, preparing to play - and sat straight up in bed, chest heaving , limbs shaking. He didn't sleep again that night.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter breakfast, Morgan and Chambers hung around the mansion - maybe too tired to get back to the city, maybe just too spooked to be alone - but Dr. Tirol returned to his brownstone to greet the day. He intended to reach out to Talbot Estus, try to make amends - maybe even offer the man treatment he could obviously benefit from. But a more intriguing opportunity presented itself - in the form of a letter from a Dr. Charles Highsmith. The letter asked for his professional aid, and offered hospitality for himself and any traveling companions he'd like to bring.\n\nNot having much in the way of companions, Tirol headed back to the only place in London he knew anyone at all - Sebastian Fagan's mansion.

        "text": "A few days ago I stumbled into a thread asking for Halloween-y Ideas as the DM had the mind to have his players roll up a bunch of stereotypical monsters. Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. And this was my response to them:\n\nA few actually. Especially if you are having them roll up monster characters for the adventure.\n\n* They are not just some scary monsters, but they are *the* Scary Monsters. And they need to save Halloween from a group of adventuring heroes and a group of good clerics trying to destroy their homeland.\n\n* They have destroyed and plundered and murdered for \"centuries\" and they have accidentally ticked off the wrong wandering deity. Now they are under a gaes (divine mission that is compelling them to complete it) to make sure a small hamlet or a big city has a great Halloween night even though their innate nature is to basically eat everyone and everyone else thinks those are just costumes. When it wears off when Halloweens over, well... \n\n* Well, it was going great and things were looking on the up and up, especially when they killed that adventuring party of heroes. Besides tasty, they had a lot of loot. And what's this about some dark cult that is about to end the world? And some party of adventurers were on their way to defeat them? And one was a little gnome with a  big golden stick... like the one I'm holding now? Uh... while they hate humans, they still you know, enjoy living... crap. Guess we gotta strip the corpses, dress up as them, and go save the world. \n\nAnd to a more \"We wanna use our campaign characters, but we're afraid of a Halloween special would result in a TPK - that doesn't seem that fun\" post sparked this idea:\n\n\n&gt; Back story for the DM: A wizard moved into the area, and has been working on a ritual. Part of an experiment to see the edges of sanity and such. He's created a circle around the local town and closed it just after nightfall. The PC's find some reason to go into the tavern, as they are getting very sleepy - part of the spell, or you could just tell them it is very late, so they get a room ( part of the generic GM description of inane information passing that most players hear but don't really listen to) when suddenly:\n\n&gt;* NPC Tavern/Inn keeper busts into the room, scared and covered in blood, slams door shut and leans back against it. Scratching noises are heard outside the door. Tavern/Inn keeper starts shouting at PC's to get up. \n\n&gt;* PCs ask whats happening, Inn Keeper explains there are monsters in the town, and they are attacking everyone. If asked what they look like, they look like dead people. One looked like old woman that used to live in the house but died recently. IF they look out the window, they see shambling hordes of zombies outside. \n\n&gt;* Soon the door is broken down, and zombies swarm into the room. The Inn keeper is the first to go, make his exit dramatic. Lots of screaming. Make it memorable, as he'll make an appearance later as another zombie.\n\n&gt;* Party dispatches zombies in the room, may even \"go for the head\" and or decapitate them. Let them, later on they will still come across more zombies, maybe even the same zombies with holes in their heads/holding their heads onto their neck stumps or reattached but backwards. \n\n&gt;* Don't pull any punches. Or bites. Make it difficult, swarm them, but don't do damage reduction or anything. It is OK for the zombies to die, they are going to come back soon anyways. Only holding more pieces of themselves together.\n\n&gt;* Have the fallen party members come back as zombies, let them know they should be trying to take out the PCs, if they are instead wanting to fight zombies, they need to distance themselves from the living people, or else they need to roll will saves to bite into some warm, living flesh.\n\n&gt;* Have them try to save as many NPCs as they can, then have the barricades fail. When they finally give up on the town, and try to make a run for it, they can't find a way out. The road leads in a circle, the forest is too dense to get a horse through, they run into the trees and wind up on the opposite side of town, running INTO town. \n\n&gt;* See the strange glow off in the distance, the only direction they CAN go without being teleported back into town. They find a wizards tower, unguarded. Inside is the wizard who did it. He talks with the party, if attacked, fights back, laughing whenever he is hurt. Like full on laughing with excitement. If slain, still talks even with holes in him/severed head, etc.\n\n&gt;* Explains it was all a dream, and thanks them for their participation. Then they wake up, it is morning, all the NPCs are scared, and shaken. Everyone was in the same dream. Some are coming up and telling people about the strange dream, if you decide, you can have others come up and tell them they are thankful for the party trying to save them/curse them for leaving them to die if they cut and ran. \n\n&gt;* Then maybe the party decides to pay this 'damn wizard a visit' and the wizards castle is empty, save a pile of gold/items and a thank you note.\n\nAnyone have any ideas for Halloween?",

        "text": "A few years back, my usual gaming group had just acquired a new member, A. We rarely played games that lasted for more than a session, and our longest 'campaigns' were rarely more than a few weeks before we moved on to something else. We tended to swap the DM mantle a lot, so when A volunteered to run something for us we were pretty happy to hand the reins over. \n \nThe day we played was a rare moment in what was months of conflicting timetables and we knew we wouldn't have a chance to play again for a while, so at some point we collectively agreed we'd just do a free form Pathfinder one-shot and have some fun. The game opened in a small village that all the characters came from, we all rolled completely random characters and had some fun exploring.\n\nRight from the start, we were facing ridiculously powerful enemies for our level. The 'mooks' we were facing were all D&amp;D 3.5e [doppelgängers](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Doppelganger) impersonating townsfolk. Their being able to cast detect thoughts as often as they liked made passwords, tests and other ways of keeping track of who wasn't a mimic almost impossible, but we were holding together thanks largely to some incredible combat rolls in the few instances when the mimics made themselves known. It was hair-raising, and I honestly expected us to die. I thought maybe that was the point, given we weren't going to play for more than a session. But we held the line, with some terrifying and hilarious moments as each of us was, at some point, playing our own doppelganger without the others knowing.\n\nWe all got very into the game, which ended up lasting well into the early hours of the morning. By this point we were all flagging, but we had discovered the magical MacGuffin the doppelgangers were after and we were evacuating the town in a desperate attempt to stop some sort of super-wizard from killing everyone to get it. I pulled the DM aside as the other players were organising the evacuation and explained that in the night my fighter would take the MacGuffin and ride in the opposite direction to the fleeing townsfolk. I figured that as the players and DM were running on sugar and willpower we could wrap the whole thing up with a 'town is saved, horror is averted' sort of ending and feel good about that. He looked a bit surprised, but agreed it was in line with my character and sent me out of the room for a moment. When he had talked to the players he came back and we rolled out the very one-sided battle between me and the lieutenant of the super-wizard, who had tracked me down. My character is captured, the MacGuffin he cleverly hid in his dead horse is discovered and that is that.\n\nWe joined the rest of the players again, and they were super pissed. I thought maybe they were upset I'd stolen the spotlight a bit with my noble sacrifice, but that wasn't it...   \nApparently I had completely misunderstood the purpose of the session. It wasn't a one-shot, it was the intro to a proper, honest-to-god year-spanning campaign and I'd effectively handed the key to world domination over the BBEG in the first session. Shit. ",

        "text": "Before I begin this sordid tale, it should be established how the DM acted and worked. \n\nThe campaign was simple, defeat a rich, evil warlock (3-man party, bard, warlock, warrior).  The DM however, acted and sounded EXACTLY like Michael Cera. He was soft-spoken and awkward, but a great DM when it came to cool ideas.\n\nNow, knowing the DM was quiet and awkward, know that my character was not.\n\nHe was Bardock, the Bard of Rock.  A human raised by orcs.  Because he was a bard and human, he was eloquent among orcs. They regarded him as a gentleman and scholar.  HOWEVER, only orcs thought this.  To the rest of the population he was just a large, rowdy frat guy.  He would always try for diplomacy, or bluffing but I had to roll for intimidate.\n\nFor example, Since I was our parties leader, I had to book rooms in the inn.\nI approached the Innkeep and thought I said, \"hello good sir, can we purchase 3 rooms?\"\nI had to roll intimidate and basically shouted, \"I AM BARDOCK BARD OF ROCK! I NEED 3 ROOMS DICKWAD!\"\n(In my head he sounded like Mark Chang, the alien from Fairly Odd Parents)\n\nThis was the way it went.\n\nNow for the fun. The Michael Cera-ish DM had to play many characters to move the story along.  Once, he played the guard who recruited us.\n\nHim: \"Gentlemen, who is in charge here?\"\n\nMe: \"IT IS I!!! BARDOCK, THE BARD OF ROCK AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU CAN GARGLE ON MY BARD NARDS!!\"\n\nHim: \"oh... Um well do you have weapons to serve the king?\"\n\nMe: \"BEHOLD! (Removes lute) THE BRUTE LUTE.\n\nHim: \"um, c-can you follow me? We need aid in the castle?\"\n\nMe: \"CAN YOU FOLLOW ME FAGGOT?!\"\n\nokbardock.mp3\n\nOk, I know that one was abrasive, but the whole table was in stitches and the DM insisted I play the character.  I asked if he was sure and he was cool.  It was almost like I wasn't intimidating, but my character was.  Also, for added humor, the DM did NOT know my actual name, so he called me Bardock the entire time.\n\n\nWell fast forward a little bit. We had to interrogate some thugs in the local shifty tavern. \n\nHere, I should mention that the DM's only condition to playing 4e was that we could \"over roll.\"  For example, the warlock wanted a distraction flare, he would need a 5 to cast a distraction. A 2 would be just a spark and a 9 would be a full blown fireball.  This made for interesting gameplay, when we didn't crit it could mean we would over exert our swings or spells and hurt ourselves.\n\nNow, we were about to interrogate the first fellow but our Teifling over-rolled at controlling his mind and accidently blew up his head. \n\nShit.jpg\n\nOk, now let's find another one.  We go downstairs and attempt to create a distraction. \n\n\"GUYS I CAN BLIND THE ROOM WHILE PLAYING MY BRUTE LUTE\"\n\nohshit.lol\n\nSo I'm jamming while the other party members sneak around. Our backup plan was to have the warlock cast a distraction flare.  \n\nI was about to strike the final note to cast a flashbang spell with my implement.\n\nRoll.\n\nCrit fail.\n\nThe crowd boos at my shitty playing and botched ending.  But, Bardock would have none of that.\nI tell the DM I will roll intimidate to fix it.\n\nO-okbardock.wav\n\nCrit.\n\nI scream into my lute, \"WORK!\"\n\nKA.....FUCKIN......BOOM\n\nThe entire room goes white. I blind some odd 50 people, including myself... And our warlock.  The blast startles him into casting his flair.\n\n19.\n\nHe needed a 4.\n\n\nOhshit.jpeg\n\nThe resulting fireball blasts the roof and second story into the air.  The fire spread soon after.  Thank god our 3rd party member was a Warforged and was unaffected by the blinding light.  He hauled us out along with the target to interrogate.\n\n\nMeanwhile, I am screaming, \"I AM BARDOCK!! I DO NOT FEAR THIS PUNY DARKNESS!!\"\n \nThe thug turns out to be a homeless guy, gifted the outfit.  The building is still falling down into the fire.  We found a trapdoor just in time. Straight to the sewer.\n\nThe best one-on-one exchange though, is when the DM was a wood elf shopkeep.  I had to \"negotiate\" some food and blankets.\n\nDM: \"ok sir, thatll be 6 gold\"\n\nMe: \"SORRY, spent that last night on your mom, I'll do 3\"\n\nHim: \"Ex-excuse me?\"\n\nMe: \"I'll GIVE YOU 3 GOLD YOU WEIRD GOPHER!\"\n\nHim: \"who do you think you are?!\"\n\nohshithereitcomes.mp4\n\n\"I AM BARDOCK, BARD OF ROCK AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU CAN GARGLE MY BARD NARDS!!\"\n\nSo I got the stuff for 3 gold and we went on our merry way.  \n\n\nI have a few more Bardock stories. I'll post if you guys liked these!",

        "text": "This took place in a homebrew campaign of 4th edition D&amp;D. The total party size was eight at this point, though there was often a person missing for a session. The party comprised of a warlord, a cleric whose creator played everyone of his characters like a chaotic neutral pyromaniac, a barbarian, a paladin, an assassin, a wizard, a rogue, and a warlock with an insane bluff score, played by me. The party was around level 4 at this point. Our employer/quest-giver had asked us to lay low for a while, which we interpreted as 'vaguely wander about and ask questions until something interesting happened.' This eventually led to us having to infiltrate a castle.\n\n After deciding that going the full muderhobo route was unfeasible, we decided that we'd have the two strongest characters (the paladin and the barbarian) get themselves arrested by way of an intimidate check against two guards. Then, we'd use their attempting to break out of the dungeons as a distraction to get the rest of the party in. So, the paladin and barbarian walk up to a pair of guards, and roll intimidate. One rolled a natural 20. The other a paltry 19. The receiver of the crit then turned and ran into the keep, shortly followed by the other guard. The two players ran forward after the guards, intimidating other guards along the way. They scored at least four 20s between the two of them while doing this. Pretty soon, every guard in the castle was running either towards of away from the two adventurers.\n\n After noticing that there was not a single guard watching the outside of the keep now, the rest of the party strolled in, disguised ourselves in guard's uniforms, and waited a bit for the ruckus to die down. Our compatriots were captured, and sent to the dungeons. We walked into the dungeons, simply using my insane bluff (+12, or +17 with a utility power) to get around any who questioned our presence. The assassin and wizard (who had a +10 in stealth for some reason) sneak attacked the two guards present, and the rest of the party wailed on the warden. We then freed the barbarian and paladin, stuck the corpses of the guards in the cells, and continued on to the lower levels, where our objective of 'something suspicious involving dragons' lay.",

        "text": "**The Backstory:** We're a group of four friends who are new to D&amp;D, learning the ropes as we go along. I've been DMing most sessions, but sometimes another in our party will DM an adventure or two. In one of our first adventures, I had our adventurers breaking into a Thieves Guild-controlled warehouse to steal back an heirloom the Guild had taken. While scouting the area, one character, Dem, got the drop on a guard patrolling around the building, and made a surprise attack with his staff to knock him out as he stopped to stare wistfully at a photograph of his wife. Dem rolled a critical hit, which I described as unintentionally breaking the poor guy's spine, killing him instantly. He looted the corpse and found the photograph, then decided to keep that as a trophy of his kill.\n\nAn adventure or two later, when Kay was DMing, the adventurers were sent back in time by a demigod to stop a war from breaking out. This understandably created a new timeline where the area hadn't been at war, things were a bit different, etc., but the main takeaway here was that the events that had happened in previous adventures, hadn't.\n\n**The Story:** Some months later, I'm DMing again and running a sandbox session where I didn't have too much planned and was just letting the PCs run their own stories in our homebrew town, Ipswick. Dem is on his way somewhere when he gets pickpocketed by a thief, who demands to know just *why* there is a picture of the thief's wife in Dem's pocket.\n\nThings rapidly escalate from there, thanks to some failed diplomacy rolls, and Dem ends up in a no magic, swords-only duel with the thief, who hadn't died at the warehouse in this timeline because the adventurers were never there.\n\nThe duel doesn't go particularly well, leaving Dem bloodied, and the thief decides he's won and walks away. Another PC who arrived on the scene during the fight, a psion with the body of a little girl, decides to get some petty revenge on the thief and conjures a duck to hit him in the face and knock him on his ass.\n\nAssuming that it was Dem that attacked him, the thief turns his attention back to Dem and some of the thief's buddies join the scramble to even the odds against someone who was obviously using magic. Realizing what she'd done, Fantasia jumps into the fray and both she and Dem get KO'd thanks to some inopportune critical hit rolls on my part. The fight ends when the third PC arrives on scene with some guards and they apprehend the original thief (the others had been taken out before Dem and Fantasia went down), who is standing with a bloody sword over the bodies of five people, including a little girl.\n\nFantasia is able to be stabilized, but Dem fails his saving throws and expires before he can be saved (also, the third PC rolled a 1 when attempting to roll to stabilize, which I described as some very, very poor attempts at CPR that broke a few ribs instead). We put on the funeral march and took a few minutes break to recuperate before resuming the session, as this was the first PC death we'd had since we began.\n\nIt wasn't terrible, as Dem's player was planning to retire the character at the end of the session anyway, but it still stung, and boy was it ironic the circumstances of his death. So many epic fights, against monsters and dragons and wizards and snakes, and he died to a low-level thief.\n\nWe all kind of had a hand in his death - I, for rolling several critical hits in a row; Fantasia, for starting the fight up again after it had ended; Laria, for her ineptitude at healing; and Dem, as well, for failing his saving throws and also keeping a picture of another man's wife in his pocket. Whoops.\n\n**TL;DR** PC died ingloriously in a street fight with a low-level thief that he had killed in an alternate timeline",

        "text": "Here's what happened at the last session of a game I'm GMing with some homebrew rules and setting. Quick note about the setting; arcane magic is pretty much outlawed in the civilized world, which resembles pre WWI Europe. Ochremark is Germany, Scythia (Where this session takes place) is France, Flowren is England, and Scaldval is a wasteland based on Russia/Scandinavia. \n\nThe Party:\nJavert: An inquisition agent of the 3rd party binder class. Pretty much the party face. His player likes to role play silly situations (He got a SoB pregnant with Daemonspawn in Dark Heresy)\n\nBrother: Vow of poverty monk of the bow and arrow archetype (don't remember the name). Best bros OOC and IC with Javert\n\nWilliam Smythe: Flowren alchemist with a penchant for blowing things up. His is new and cursed by the dice gods\n\nPhineas von Heilbronner: Ochremarken engineer and bard class. His player is a fantastic RPer and makes silly characters (Phineas kills people with a giant wrench)\n\nThe Story:\nThe sun rose over the city of Orlene to find the Inquisition Temple in its scheduled morning prayer ritual. As the clock struck 8th bell Inquisitor Javert was called into Hierarch Enjolras’ office for assignment. The agent of the Inquisition was assigned to look into possibly connected disappearances. In the city of Roanne children were disappearing from the streets and homes with increasing frequency. On a much larger scale whole settlements: outposts, hamlets, and trading posts, along the border of the Scaldval wastes were vanishing. Not the traditional work of Scaldval Warbands to be certain. The Hierarch informed Javert of the situations and left the investigation to him. Javert was given leave and proper compensation to put together a team. Together with his long time partner, a monk known only as Brother, he prepared. Brother collected the dossiers of two free agents and brought them into the fold. The first, an Ochremakren engineer and novice tinkerer, Phineas von Heilbronner, was in Scythia to find rare mechanics for a new invention he was working on. Brother met him at his hotel, The Olde Guard, and quickly convinced the older man to join the investigation. The second man was William Smythe,  a Flowren alchemist and former military man turned mercenary with a reputation for explosives and slightly unbalanced temperament. Heading to his Tavern, The Lusty Barmaid, Brother elected to remain outside until William excited. Like Phineas, William joined the investigation. After communing with The Lord, Javert met the other three at the Inquisition Temple at midday and embarked via steamcar to the village of Roanne.\n \nRoanne, a small settlement grown around the mine that has since run dry and been closed, was in a gloomy state. On their way to the Mayor’s office Phineas took measure of the mood of the town and found that people were worried and distrustful of strangers, but quick enough to show hope when learning of the Inquisition's investigation. At the mayor’s office the party was informed that 9 children had disappeared over the past 4 months, with increasing frequency. 2 had been taken in the last week alone. Originally it had been only urchins and gypsies but the most recent were the visiting nephew of the Church’s priest, Father Pontmercy, and the baker’s boy Jeremiah. The only trend that the party could tell from the group was that all were taken in the night and all were under the age of 11. Phineas recalled with his Bardic Knowledge that three of the children had strange happenstances occur; a girl’s eye’s had changed colour and then changed back, a boy’s hair stood on end as if electrified, a boy had glittered for a moment in the sun. The party convinced the mayor to hold a town assembly that night at 6th bell and decided to investigate as they could until then.\n \nBrother and Javert went next door to the church to talk to Father Pontmercy about his nephew’s disappearance. The boy had been visiting from the Capitol in Valois to study the priesthood from his uncle before entering the seminary. He disappeared from his bed three nights prior with no indication of struggle or confrontation. Javert went to his room and studied his effects and communed with the spirits to scry for the boy. During his hour long dreamwalk he found the boy but only saw fractured images and sounds. The child appeared to be underground digging, and then the cackle of a mad woman was heard in the background, then only blackness. Brother in the mean time kept the priest busy with theological discussion in the main worship hall. After the hour the two thanked the priest and made their way to the baker’s home.\n \nMeanwhile William and Phineas explored the town looking for other clues. They came across two children, a 5 year old girl and her 6 year old brother playing hopscotch in the street while the neighbors looked attentively on. Phineas and William made their way to a large muscled man named Max, watching the children from across the street. Phineas, being the more gregarious of the two, introduced himself and sought what information Max knew. The bald, bearded man, once learning of their Inquisition affiliation,  told him much the same story that they had heard in the mayor’s office, with one added detail. The Baker’s boy, Jeremiah, was rumoured to be a young mage. “Blasphemous as sorcery is the boy was too young to learn to control his power. It wasn't right that he was taken, mage or not.” Max noted. Abruptly in the middle of reminding Phineas of the corruption of magic and the faith of the town Max’s gaze went upward to the roof of the building across from him and shouted in surprise. Phineas and William tried to see what Max had spotted but nothing seemed to be there, looking back to Max the man’s face went neutral and then, as if waking from a dream, continued his lecture on the evils of magic. The two disengaged from the conversation as soon as it was polite and William went to investigate the building. It was dark but lived in, the owners clearly out for the day’s work. The roof itself looked unremarkable but William couldn’t notice anything out of place from his distance and decided against climbing to investigate in broad daylight. Phineas went and talked to the children. They were both too young to fully understand the situation but Amelia mentioned that her friend Sara, a beggar girl, with whom she used to play, hadn’t been around in awhile. Max called the children into his home for lunch, doing a favour for their mother who was at work. William decided to go find Javert and Brother and tell them about Max’s apparent memory lapse while Phineas said he would stick around to investigate and keep an eye on the children.\n \nBrother and Javert had made their way to the Baker’s home and there met his grieving wife. Brother comforted the woman while Javert went to Jeremiah’s room to scry the boy as he had with the priest’s nephew. Laying down for his dreamwalk he saw Jeremiah in a similar position, hauling dirt and earth somewhere apparently underground. Likewise he heard the woman’s mad cackle again but caught the words “more, soon” and the snippet of the word “ium.” The rest faded out fuzzily into the blackness.\n \nPhineas used his abilities to sense magic in the area and found that the roof had the latent touch of magic, though it was weak. Deciding to see if whatever person or creature still resided there he used detect thoughts and heard a disturbing voice repeating, “Children, Mistress, Serve” over and over. Deeply unsettled he rushed to Max’s home and insisted that the children be taken away, someplace safe. Max, heeding the warning, grabbed both children and his hammer and lead the group at haste to his sister’s home across town. Along the way Phineas grabbed the town crier to bring a message to his friends that the town meeting tonight would be too late to prevent what was going to happen. He also had a flash of insight and remembered an old tall from Ochremark about Thin Men; creatures of the night who would steal children and who could hide in plain sight and make those who saw them forget. The group sped with great haste to Max’s sister’s place.\n \nWilliam was interrupted by the crier and made haste to the mayor’s office to assemble to town guards.\n\nWhen Phineas and Max made their way to his sister’s home and the children were given to her care, though Phineas was sure not to let them leave his sight, Phineas told Max the story of the Thin Men. Max seemed confused but the more Phineas spoke the more he remembered that he saw a creature resembling the description of the roof earlier. All of a sudden the window’s crashed in as 4 Thin Men assaulted the home. They were grotesque with long, almost skeletal appendages and razor sharp claws. Brother, two houses down with the Baker’s wife, heard the crash of glass and went to investigate. Combat ensued and Max was wounded terribly, but saved due to Phineas’ aid. Brother arrived in time to slay one of the creatures, but one grabbed Amelia and hauled her out of the window. Brother attempted to pursue the two but lost them in only a few moments.\n \nThe party assembled over the corpse of the creature, now knowing their enemy, and shared information before deciding that the best course of action was to head to the mines, the likely nest of the Thin Men. Fortunately Max was a former mine foreman, before it was shut down due to depletion of the iron vein a few years ago. Town guards were sent to retrieve the corpse and spread the word of their new enemy.\n \nThe trip to the mine was without incident, though the mood has heavy and dark not knowing the fate of Amelia and the other children now that the Thin Men’s role was understood. Coming into the main hall of the mine the party found themselves attacked from all sides by Thin Men. Combat was short but brutal, many of the creatures perished, while Max was slain. Saying quick prayers over the body, the party continued deeper, guided by Phineas and William’s engineering insight. Proceeding further the party set off a minor cave in, trapping them and pushing them deeper. The sounds of digging reached their ears and Javert sent his Chameleon familiar, who up until this time had not been mentioned, through the tunnel past the bend. Through his familair’s eyes Javert saw teams of children digging the far wall, though for what he could not tell. Near them sat a one armed woman on a stone throne talking to a cat. She was thin and dark and gave off an aura of menace. As she stroked the cat she called out, loud enough for the party to hear, “It looks like we have guests Hashmal! Come into the light little ones.”\n\nJavert sent an illusory image of the woman into the cave but she rebuffed it and with a snap the image vanished. “You’ll have to do better than that little ones!’ she mocked.\n \nThe party entered the open room as watched them with callous eyes. “Brave, strong heroes! I suppose you’re here to rescue the children aren’t you? Well you don’t want to be rescued do you Sara/” She snapped again and a small girl came to stand by her side and the woman patted the girl’s head. Brother could stand no more of this injustice and let loose a flurry of arrows toward the woman but only one hit it’s mark. The woman cackled and pulled the arrow from her flesh, licking the bloody head and turned it to ash. “Fine then little ones, Hashmal!” The cat magnified to an absurd size and let loose a war cry that shook the party to its core. As combat ensued it became clear that the woman was a powerful witch, unleashing a torrent of magic that brought Phineas to his knees in hideous laughter and froze a section of the cavern. William learned the hard way that his bombs did nothing but enrage the cat further, who tore into him and threw him to a wall, dazed. Phineas rallied the party with his brave words and tried to save the children, only to find that they were in a trance like state and unresponsive. All would have surely met their death if not for Brother’s incredible bow work, firing an unending volley of arrows into the beast Hashmal until it was forced back into it’s usual feline form. The witch and beast disappeared into mist before either could be brought to justice however, with only her cackled echoing in the darkening room. The children all fell into unresponsive comas from which the party could not wake them.\n \nThis investigation was far from over.\n",

        "text": "My friends and I are playing an L5R campaign adapted for D&amp;D 3.5. I am Barthur the Bard, affectionately know as B. Arthur, who lays down the tasty licks for the group. The other members present this session were Hank, a Scout and Southern Gentleman, and Zar, a low int Sorcerer/Rogue that likes to burn things.\n\nThis is my first D&amp;D campaign, but the rest of the group are veterans. Our session begins as we teleported to a seaside town that was recently sieged. There are some Humans, Undead, and Orcs in town, all enemy forces. The town is enclosed by a four story stone wall on 3 sides that is a structure within itself.\n\nWe enter the wall and start going up some stairs. We were between the 1st and 2nd level when we hear some Orcs talking. I use my comprehend language to hear them discussing food,\n\n“I’m Hungry. We should get some food.”\n\n“I could go for a pig right now”\n\nAlso, in my possession is a crown of comprehension that allows me to understand/speak any language. I use this in combination with Ventriloquism to lure them out of the way, \n\n“Hey! I just saw a pig over here! Come help me get it!”\n\nIt works and the Orc guards leave. We make our way to the gatehouse on the 4th floor, just above the main gate. The door opens and inside is the Whoresassain (that’s another tale altogether), an NPC that has been stalking us and trying to kill us. She is accompanied by five Human and five Orc Guards. We have some items she needs and promised to turn them over. In return, she won’t kill us.\n\nWe hand over the items. Our DM says, \n\n“Roll for initiative.”\n\nOh shit. We’re gonna die.\n\nFirst attack is the Whoresassain, she downs two of the guards with throwing daggers. We are stunned. We thought for sure she was going to murder us. The fight continues until four of the five Orcs surrender. The Whoresassain, having what she wanted, left. We end up interrogating/killing the Orcs. We were getting ready to depart when one of the slain Humans gets up.\n\n“Uh, aren’t you dead?” asks Zar.\n\n“Well I am now.” The other humans start to stir.\n\nI scream, “Ve need to leaf now. Get behind me!” (I failed to mention, Barthur has an 80’s German Eurotrash accent) I then cast Grease to keep the Undead from literally rising. And in the hopes that my pyromaniac party will set the room on fire. They obliged. \n\nWe make our way down the nearest stairwell. Just as we hit the ground floor, we encounter five more Orcs. Out of character, I tell my party I’ll handle this. They collectively release an annoyed sigh.\n\nI notoriously roll poorly on my most of my checks. The party believe my dice are cursed. I roll a 17. I have 13 in Bluff. Knowing that the Orcs have a fondness for pork and the fact that there is a fire upstairs, I proclaim, \n\n“Hey! Zere’s a pig roast in ze gatehouse upstairs!” The DM rolls to see if they believe it. He looks up at me angrily.  It works. The guards stumble over each other, clamouring for that sweet juicy hog. Which in reality, is a room full of burning undead. It’s at this point we split up. Hank and Zar are going to go to the dungeon to free any prisoners. I am going to the sea to try and sneak aboard a docked supply ship. Our DM decides to tell my part of the tale first,\n\n“Ok, so you are going to have to make it all the way around one and a half sides of this wall. There are three guard sections you will have to make it past. You can fight, stealth, or attempt to speak your way passed them.”\n\nMy damage die is only 1d6. My Hide/Move Silently are both 5. Looks like it’s gonna be Bluff again. The DM asks for my first roll against another group of Orcs. 18 for a 31, \n\n“Hey! See zat smoke? Zere’s a pig roast!”\n\nDM asks for my second roll, against still another group of Orcs. 17 for 30,\n\n“Pig Roast!”\n\nDM asks for my final roll, against two humans. 19 for a 32. I ask him if the pig roast thing will work on them. He says probably not. To the Human, I say,\n\n“Hey, does ze tip of my Rapier taste like chocolate?” DM says that won’t fly and to try again.\n\n“Oh hey, zat room iz on fire! Go help zem!” They leave. I then successfully sneak onto the ship by convincing some guards on the dock that I am their prisoner via Fascinate/Suggestion( Check these licks, they’re fucking tasty!) I then tell them to jump overboard. The End.\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2k3z1o/a_story_about_my_favorite_character_ive_ever_made/",
        "text": "My favorite character I ever made in a tabletop game to date was Hoshi, the Troll Street Samurai a year ago or so. My group only got to play once, due to distance issues. It really sucks, but I'd love to get him back into the fray one day.\n\nHoshi was large, even for a troll. He stood at about 10 feet tall, and was strong enough to rip a door off its' hinged with just one hand. He was also an Oni, which meant he had red skin, and closely resembled a [Japanese Demon](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/116/d/2/oni_red_by_faust_and_company-d632q27.jpg). He was also obsessed with Samurai, and specialised in melee weapons. He followed a strict code of honor, and he avoided any form of trickery if possible.\n\nThis all ties into his past. He grew up on the streets of Japan, until he started running at a very young age. One one run, it turns out that one of his companions had been bought out, and they had set up a nasty ambush with the Yakuza Gang. His entire \"party\" was killed off; but not Hoshi. Hoshi stood his ground, and fought. He slaughtered all of his ambushers, but he himself was mortally wounded.\n\nLuckily, he knew a doctor that could patch him up enough to be in healthy enough shape to leave the country. He was transported to Denver where a cybernetics expert saved his life; but at a great cost. All of his limbs were replaced with cybernetic prosthetics, he had a new heart, and had new, plated skin. He was literally more machine than man (meta-man?), and he felt hollow. On top of that, he had a pretty severe case of PTSD regarding the Yakuza. This is where My game picked up.\n\nNow, you see, Hoshi had, one one of his last runs in Japan, found a Guan Dao mounted on the wall of a Yakuza boss. The blade was electrified, and was shaped like spout of flame. The base of the blade had an open dragon's mouth. This became Hoshi's default weapon, thinking it was more samurai-esque of him. Hoshi didn't actually know anything about samurai, aside from shitty magazine covers.\n\nAfter his cybernetics, he realized he didn't need any body armor, as his dermal plating could stop enough bullets for him to come close to people. Instead, he wore a pair of leather pants, and walked around everywhere shirtless. On his back was a (quite frankly, tacky) animated tattoo of an [Asian Dragon](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080731195058/dragons/images/6/67/Chinese_dragon.JPG) roaring and spewing out flames. He thought that it would help depict the ferocity of the Samurai (Once again, Hoshi was horribly misinformed).\n\nHe didn't have any of his cybernetic limbs hidden by false skin, even though it was an immesely illegal amount of military-grade hardware. And by military grade, I mean that he had retractable chainsaw blades built into his wrists, and a could pop a couple of trench knives out of his ankles. Hiding this would be dishonorable, and he couldn't stand for that. Hoshi was a fucking idiot sometimes. \n\nNow that you have a really good picture of his character; a 10 foot talk Robot demon that specialized in cutting people in half, let me introduce you to the rest of the group:\n\nHuni, the androgynous elf, was a shaman and a healer. Hoshi couldn't particularily benefit from Huni's magic, though, due to being made of more metal than flesh. (The more cybernetics you have, the less affected you are by friendly magic). Huni was a runt and stood at ~4 feet tall. Hoshi towered over them, but didn't intimidate them at all. They used a lot of mind magic, and assumed they could control Hoshi if he became a threat,\n\nOur Decker went by the name of Decker Cane, and was a rich, snobby human teenager who fantasized the idea of Shadowrunning. He bought all kinds of expensive tech and cybernetics, and always wore a Daft Punk helmet. He just about pissed his pants the first time he met Hoshi.\n\n**Editors Note: From here on I start using the first person. sorry for the perspective shift**\n\nThe first (and sadly, only) run we went on involved tracking down some gangers, and stealing their weapon shipment. Hardly before we had even started investigating, a someone had started shooting up the bar we were all sitting around in. I bolted out the door and chased the guy back to his monocycle. He revved it up, but it was too late. I made a strength+body check, popped out my chainsaw blades, and grabbed the wheel of his cycle in two spots, and dug the blades in. The ganger's bike was effectively jammed. He stared at me in horror while Huni interrogated him with some sort of empath magic (I'm sorry, it's been a long time and I don't remember much of the spells; but it was SR4E). We found out that the weapon shipment was supposed to come down the road a few blocks , in an unmarked white van. After we got his information. I let him go. it's not honorable to kill a charmed and defenseless person, after all.\n\nSo we went down to the Road where the shipment was supposed to show up, and we set up an \"ambush\" to stop the van. Huni stood behind a rock, preparing to summon a spirit, while Cane took cover in an abandoned office building, preparing to hack into their van. I decided to take a much more direct approach, and lined 50 feet of barbed wire along the road, and stood directly behind it, Guan Dao drawn. Surely enough, the van came. What we didn't expect was for it to have an automated turret attached to the top. They must not have seen the makeshift caltrops I left on the ground, though, because they drove right the fuck over them, and found themselves stuck face-to-face with a very threatening troll.\n\nThreatening, that is, until they stepped out of the car. Hoshi could recognise the colors of their suits anywhere; These were Yakuza thugs. I dropped to the floor and started weeping and shaking. Memories of my friends being mangled to death overcame me. I was completely defenseless as the panic attack seeped in. Our plan was shot, and Huni had to act fast. An enormous wolf spirit jutted out behind a rock, immediately attracting the attention of the thugs. They fired a few rounds, and the turret began to spin up...\n\nThe turret started firing on the Yakuza. One of them immediately dropped to the ground. An autotuned laugh was heard from inside the office building. The wolf spirit that Huni called danced around the Yakuza, taking a swipe where it could, until an eruption of fire came from an alleyway. A new spirit, a nine-tailed fox, slowly walked out. A plume of fire erupted from it's mouth, and it leaped at the wolf. They were locked in combat, dancing around the van with wicked, deadly attacks.\n\nI had, by now, started to recover. The dread I experienced was replaced with intense rage. I grabbed my Guan Dao and rushed towards the van. I stood on the side, across from an obvious decker taking cover from the rogue turret. I was taller than the van itself, and easily was able to just lunge my polearm downwards across the top, goring the blade through his throat. His colleague, noticing the immediate death of his friend, climbed up on top of the van, and drew his katana. I, knowing this was a challenge for honorable combat, climbed up as well, faintly denting the reinforced roof. the turret turned to face my opponent, so I smashed it with my heel. Nobody was to interfere. \n\nHe swung up high, and I easily deflected the attack with the base of my weapon. I swung for his legs, and he hopped. it was a dance of steel, but he had made a fatal error. He came in close.\n\nHe stepped forwards, hoping, most likely, to avoid the Guan Dao's blade. I Grabbed my hand forward, completely ignoring his slash at my waist. I didn't even feel it. I grabbed him by the shoulder, lifted him about 3 feet in the air, and asked,\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\nHe said nothing at first, but then laughed. He laughed hysterically. \n\"I recognize you! You're a wanted man! Nobody expected to see you this far from home, though!\"\nHe was dead before he hit the floor.\n\nI opened the back of the van, horrified and furious. The fighting outside had died down. Huni was tending to some burn wounds that Decker Cane was inflicted by the fox spirit.\n\nI was met with a spray of acid. The damn mage stayed hidden in the van. I topped over, every part of me melting to his devious magic. He laughed, saying something about a bounty.\nthen there was a series of gunshots, and the mage toppled over. Decker stood, holding a revolver, and sent me an emoticon winky through the screen of his helmet.\n\nInside the van was a series of coolers, all containing ice and human (or metahuman) organs.\nA picture of the traitorous member from my running group back in Japan was mounted on the wall.",

        "text": "In my homebrewed world, not all monsters are evil. Most were corrupted by their gods evil influence, but most of the gods are kinda asleep (main thing about the world) so they can do whatever they want. I plan on having some lawful good wannabe-paladins that just happen to be three-stooges-esq goblins. But that is for a later story.\n\nOne of the earliest dungeons my group went through, was a cave full of orcs and goblins. Well, actually, what happened was they were sent to this cave to repay a favor, and they had to relocate some items in the cave. But they found it was full of goblinkin. The cave was actually a training dungeon that the Quest Giver (one of the heads of the Fighters Guild, kinda insane) has been stocking with mostly knocked out and confused orcs, goblins and hobgoblins that he's been waylaying from around the area. It was very strange, especially since some of the orcs rose to leadership ranks, and the cave complex was huge, so there were different factions that arose. Some portions it was easier to use diplomacy to get past - because again, a lot of these monsters were not really evil. Just confused, and sorta lost in this huge labyrinth.\n\nThe other dungeon that they went through, I had a lot of fun designing. The kingdom they are in sits on the ruins of older kingdoms. Like a lot of them. And the technological level has shifted back and forth, as the gods had temper-tantrums and destroyed civilization every few hundred or thousand years. So they hear about monsters in the sewers. They figure it's a good adventure, and head into the sewers. Inside, they find a lot of twisting tunnels, flowing water, etc.\n\nThen they find a break in the wall, and it leads to another set of pipes. But the stone masonry is all kind of weird. And it gets stranger, as they move on. I was tempted for them to find like modern sewer systems, but that would have broken the game. Instead, they basically stumbled into a series of tunnels, that actually were part of an old secret escape tunnel for the castle, in times of sieges.\n\nIf they had gone left, they would have wound outside the town a few miles. But they went right. And they came across a dead end, with some torch sconces (holders/wall light thingy) that triggered a secret door. Into an underground vault! Score! And with live guards! Not so score! Yep, they found their way into the kings castle, particularly the vault room. Through a secret door no one in the castle knew about. Oops. Now through fast talking, they are officially sanctioned adventurers meant to ferret out any more secrets the layer-cake of a city has to offer.\n",

        "text": "I just started a new campaign Mutants &amp; Masterminds. It’s loosely inspired by Marvel’s newuniversal, where a White Event randomly grants some people powers. People at large are still unaware of superpowers.\n\nThis is a transcript mostly for my own use but I figured some could appreciate it here. We had so much fun that my roommate, who had decided not to join, decided he will be there next session! If people here request it, I would continue posting the resumes here.\n\nThe adventure is A More Perfect Union, the introductory adventure of Paragons, a *Mutants &amp; Masterminds* campaign setting. **Expect spoilers**. I gave lots of chances, not having mastered for a while and this being a new group and all.\n*Hero points*: M&amp;M has some special one-session-only points which give players more control over the story, like rerolling dice and changed some specifics in scenes.\n\nThe crux of the story is that Carol Molloy, a primary school teacher, has, after a car accident, become comatose and starts to manifest powers. Unconsciously, she creates a group-mind that infects people through touch. This all happens in a small suburban town on the West Coast.\n\nDecon, a brick mason with animal shapeshifting powers, knows the family through a contact and the children loved him. They manage to contact him, asking for help, just before the line cuts. The local police are of no help.\nGrant, an ex-con man with mental (emotion control for now) powers, was raised in the small town. His recent release from prison has triggered a re-evaluation of his life.\n\nSayed, an avatar of cities (inspired by Jack Hawksmoor) and taxi driver, has heard from weird happenings from multiple clients and he feels an uneasiness coming from Unity, through his powers.\n\nThey all happen to be in town at the same moment. Stopping at the dinner, Sayed is very talkative, getting more info about the town and its inhabitants, as the gregarious taxi driver he is. He learns that a school teacher was recently into an accident and the owner of the diner seems overly sad. Overhearing this, the intrigued Grant looks up online and instantly finds an article about it.\n\nThey go to the local tavern to get some more information. A drunk man sees them and asks them to leave town as soon as they can. They attempt to pry some more information out of him but his friends come and they take him away. Grant's powers knock him out by mistake. Oops. When the man wakes up, he’s suspiciously more sober and doesn’t seem to care about them anymore.\n\nThey enter the tavern, everything seems fine until Sayed offers a toast to Carol Molloy, some townspeople seem distressed but they don't say anything more. Sayed then challenges someone to a game of pool. Decon accepts and trumps him. They discuss the situation in town before Grant convinces them to talk about it outside. He successfully cons Decon into thinking he's CIA but Sayed sees through his lies. Regardless, they team up and take the Myste... uh, taxi, to the Molloys’ home, late at night.\n\nThe father and husband, Tom, is unsettled when Decon calls and tells him he's in a taxi up-front (at the same moment, Sayed is trying to put his taxi sign on the hood of the car). Seemingly unsettled by this, he offers them coffee regardless. \"You’re not alone? You invited the taxi driver? Uh... I guess it's better than him waiting outside... I guess.\" They manage to \"convince\" Tom to get the kids and him a lift to school tomorrow as they are worried for them, and Grant is “CIA”. Soon after, they go back to the motel, which mysteriously has rooms available. It was being shown as having no vacancy at the time of their arrival…\n\nWhile taking rooms, Grant goes in the lobby and dials the previous caller, learning no new information. Just as they being to fall asleep, they hear a mob coming closer. Policemen arrive and ask them to come to the station for questioning. Grant hides in the bathroom, \"it's going to take some time\" he says. \"We'll wait\". As he finally finishes, they take everyone to the station and try to get them to cells so they can be assimilated after the required 24 hours. Grant resists while Sayed escapes the cell using one of his city powers. Grant somehow manages to get everyone to sit down and talk (he's very persuasive...). The player characters say they will leave town but as they do, the policemen try to absorb them one last time. Sayed fakes being controlled, not knowing the entity is a group-mind. They decide to fight. Decon transforms into an ape/gorilla, surprising everyone (\"He has powers too!?\"), rolls a 20, and sends a policeman flying like a ragdoll. They beat the rest, except one, which Grant hypnotizes so they can leave.\n\nUsing another city power (“Keys to the city”), Sayed takes a police car and drives up north as fast as he can. Less than a minute later, a police car joins in pursuit. The pursuant gets closer and suddenly, Sayed rolls a critical fail! He manages to avoid an accident but their stolen squad car comes to a stop. Grant jumps into action and mental blasts the lone policeman, who rolls a critical fail on his resistance check: the car swerves off the road and tumbles off the road! They speed up to reach the clinic north of the city, where they learned Carol is staying.\n\nThey don’t stop again. I ask Sayed’s player which power he wants to use to jump into the clinic, as per his initial idea, he instead says “I use a power stunt to protect the car with X power and I ram into the wall”. Slack-jawed, I accept. They smash into the wall at full speed, smashing it into pieces, just as attendants roll Carol Molloy’s unconscious body out of the room. (Decon’s character used a hero point to put her downstairs into the room where they were “entering”.)\n\n“The taxi for Ms. Molloy is here!” Sayed exclaims as he exits the mangled car, unscathed.\n\nThey hold the attendants in while more police cars are coming. The Unity resists strongly (rolled a critical success), even knocking Sayed out before he regains composure (critical fail resolved with a hero point). Then the Unity rolls a critical fail on the last mental check allowed to get the comatose woman to wake up. Carol wakes up! “Where am I?” she asks. They all sigh, relieved. It’s over for now. (or until next session)",

        "text": "Originally posted by me a few hours ago. It was in response to a \"how do you run an army battle in DnD effectively\" and while my answer may not have been the most effective, I think I gave a pretty good example of Pro and Con ways of doing it.\n\nWell, a few things come to mind, mostly from my own experience as both player, and a DM.\n\nDon't set up the battle as a railroad. My (ex-DM) friend set us up over the course of several days for a coming war. We were psyched. And the day of, it was wave after wave of enemies. If we ever felt we were never going to see much combat, we were wrong. But... he planned his army too huge. And was not using the NPC army on our side effectively. What could have been a 2 day battle, took close to a week. And it got boring. Oh, so very boring. This is not the railroad, this is just mis-managing his time.\n\nThe PC's were the show, not running the show. Then, after clearing out nearly all the bad guys, nearly by ourselves, out pops an ancient dragon. We all auto-fail our will saves, run around like scared chickens, then the dragon casts sleep. Turns out the dragon was the final boss of his campaign, and we were always supposed to fail. Wake up in the infirmary, amnesia, the whole shebang. It sucked. We quit.\n\nThe game we're running now, with me being the DM, had it's own issues.\n\nParty arrives at this town, none of them are locals, so they have no idea what they are getting into. Suddenly, while they are in the tavern, they hear shouting from outside, the barkeeps wife runs in, shouting \"they're here!\" and the party is like WTF? They go outside.\n\nOutside is a floating air-ship, lined with stone/iron golems, and then the golems jump. I have them roll for initiative as the golems - there are about 200 of them, we're a level 5 party, start landing around them. But not all of them were going towards my party. No, they were going to other parts of town. But wait, you may be wondering WTF am I doing to my party sending that much walking construct mayhem at them.\n\nThey came to the town during a celebration. The golems that dropped down first, were halved bonuses, HP, and didn't have their resistance. Much lower CR, but same filling flavor of fighting them. I had them stay in the same grid section of town, and moved the golems into their section. Always like 2 or 4 at a time, after the others were destroyed.\n\nIf any of the party actually took the time to look around, they would have noticed the golems were only going after the people with weapons readied. (I did that on purpose) meanwhile, most of the townsfolk are cheering and watching from the \"sidelines\" - although the \"sidelines\" were large enough so that stray fireballs couldn't incinerate lil Johnny the street urchin that has been looking forward to the year end festival...\n\nThen bigger ones came out, which were the regularly listed ones in the MM. Then a giant one (the CR 16 or 17 one, like half the size of 1960's Godzilla) and whole other NPC parties had to help take it down. It was filled with candy, XP, and a lot of gold.\n\nBut I calculated wrong, that's the real danger of fighting armies. My level 5 party got something close to 500,000 XP... suddenly I had a bunch of level 14+ PC's on my hands. Before they realized how badly I messed up, I lowered the given XP and instead gave them really nice items.\n\nThey had a blast, and the entire battle took a 4 hour session. That was pretty great for something that I tossed out on the fly.\n\nNext I'm having them go on an Island Hopping Holy/Guild Bar Crawl. But they want to try coming back to Hearthstone for the next End of Year Celebration to see how well they can do against the giant golem in a few levels.\n\nEdit: Spelling mistakes and grammar errors.\n\nEdit 2: Just realized that Hearthstone was also the name of a Warcraft thing. Awkward. ",

This is the tale of Jesus \"Septic\" Ramirez.\n\nThis was in my first game of XCOM, playing on Normal. I took a mission to Argentina to lower panic across South America, and wound up with a free Assault for my trouble. I thought, in my naïveté, that I could just sideline the guy for the rest of the game in favor of my A-listers, who I was convinced were immortal. Besides, he had a stupid nickname. One crash site fuckup later, and one of my frontline Assaults was sitting in medical. So I started using Jesus. Time passed, and eventually he was as good a soldier as anyone else. Then I got the Gollop chamber. Jesus was in the second or third round of testing, and I was getting desperate looking for psykers. Finally, Jesus comes out of the chamber and starts performing miracles. His psychic powers saved the whole damn team, including the Argentinian heavy from the tutorial, so many times I lost count. The temple ship mission came, and of course I picked Jesus to be the Volunteer. The mission ended with a dramatic plasma sniper double-tap, and then the end cutscene played. I sat back, stunned, as I realized that Jesus had given his life to save the human race. \n\nSo that's the story of psychic shotgun Jesus. Really got invested in the guy. Was a hell of a way to end my first XCOM game.",

        "text": "I originally posted this as a submission on the Tales From the Tabletop Tumblr Blog.\n\nIn the few days before a strange set of events made me my group’s go to DM, I played a 4th ed Lawful Good Dwarvin Paladin of Moradin. My group was running through the 4th edition’s Intro adventure and were in a ruined fort, where much to my party’s dismay my paladin had mistaken a font of holy water for a common wash basin and contaminated it with goblin blood. We had just freed a horse from it’s bonds when suddenly a group of kobolds appeared from nowhere and ordered us in broken Common to follow them. So we noting that they had not attacked and had us well outnumbered, followed curious as to how this would play out. Of course the Kobolds took us to their dragon overlord, who wanted a word with us. Cue the rogue saying “I’ve got the best diplomacy let me handle this” and then promptly wording his diplomacy in a very insulting way that cost him a check. My paladin, seeing what was about to go down, throws himself to his knees and says, “Oh great and powerful dragon, we are but poor adventurers. Surely one as mighty as yourself could show us mercy in exchange for our service.” The dragon suddenly is no longer interested in the bumbling rogue and answered, “Are you calling me weak?” My paladin quickly replied, “Oh no, mighty one. I simply was offering our help with something that may be beneath the notice of one so great as you. Maybe a minor annoyance that you need dealt with.” The dragon got very interested in this new diplomat and answered once again, “There is a Necromancer in the other wing of this old fort who is trying to encroach upon my territory, I could of course kill him quite easily, but you have offered to help so I shall let you and your companions prove your worth to me by dealing with this problem. Return to me when the deed is done and I shall reward you greatly.” The main problem with this was that the other players, none to happy about being pledged to the service of a dragon, wanted me to justify my paladin’s actions to them. I said, ” the dragon had us brought to him so he was willing to deal and I could not sit idly by while the rogue got us killed just because I’m Lawful Good, if I had the blood would be on my hands. I did what I did to avert conflict and therefore save lives.” Luckily for me, the DM was pleased by my initiative and didn’t try to alignment shift me (Though the group, still somewhat angry about the fouled holy water, did crack some jokes about my paladin’s “True Motives”).",

        "text": "This story takes place in the same campaign as [my last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2jqt4q/dd_35_how_i_fell_in_love_with_tabletop_rpgs/), I had such a good time writing it I thought I would continue to share.\n\nThis tale continues the story of the nameless CN Ranger. As I remember his exploits I realise he was probably more Evil than Neutral but we were all new to gaming at the time, which is also why he doesn't have a name. Also in the party was a Halfling Rogue, a Human Fighter, and another friend had just joined and opted for a Human LG Paladin. They had been questing about, meeting people, tracking down BBEG, and meeting some helpful NPC's. Essentially, the large mining industry was *not all that it seemed!* and the BBEG appeared to be using some strange resources and a bit of magic to create some super crazy armour that dissolved to ash upon the wearers death.\n\nFollowing some leads and exploring the island, our intrepid heroes found a heavily guarded cave by the ocean. Having spotted it before they were seen, they hid out in the wilderness watching the cave to find out what nefarious deeds were afoot. Not long before nightfall a large mining cart full of the shiny black material the armour was made of was being hefted out of the cave by a single blonde woman, who proceeded to roll a large boulder in front of the entrance to the cave and continue on with the cart, being joined by the guards, leaving the entrance unprotected.\n\nExamination of the cave entrance proved rather disheartening as the stone door, which we had assumed was fake or enchanted, was, in fact, a really big, heavy, stone, which we could not move. The party, devoid of spellcasters, was forced to find another solution. Who or what could have the might to move such a boulder? Ah-hah! That random giant freaky insect thing we communicate with via magical mcguffin!\n\nA few IG days later we have recruited giant-bug-thing to move the boulder so we can move down into the cave and spy upon it's contents. We carefully snuck into the dark, damp cave and moved trepidatiously downwards, happening upon a large door. The Rogue, being the sneakiest among us, opened the door a crack and relayed to the rest of us what he found inside. A cavernous opening and in the centre, a large furnace type machine. Ragged slaves were being whipped and forced to load ore into the machine and out the other side was coming the strange material we had seen. There were about 6 guards there, alternately beating the slaves or standing watch. We closed the door gently and returned to the surface to discuss our next step.\n\nObviously a frontal assault would be crazy, we had scrapped with these guards before and we could barely put a dent in that magical armour. We needed to find away to take this place down and cripple BBEG's armour production.\n\n\"And rescue the slaves\" pipes up the Paladin.\n\nSo while discussing various options ranging from hiding out in the tunnel until they sleep to drawing the guards into the tunnel so we could bottleneck them and have the advantage of higher ground, CN Ranger has a brilliant idea! The cave is by the beach, the tunnel leads *down*. The foundry is *below sea level*, and it just so happens, we have a sea full of water just here!\n\nExcitedly CN Ranger explains his plan to the party.\n\n\"We recruit the freaky bug thing to help us dig a trench to the mouth of the cave then when the tide comes in, the ocean does the job for us! We drown out the foundry and the guards, and the water running down the tunnel will make it too slippery for the guards to get up, and even if they make it, I can take potshots with my longbow from the cave mouth! It's brilliant! We can kill a bunch of bad guys and take out an evil magical armour foundry without even raising a sword!\"\n\n\"But the slaves will drown too\" says the Paladin.\n\n\"Acceptable losses, considering the big picture\" replies CN Ranger\n\n\"I can't let you do it. I can't let you take innocent lives\"\n\n\"If you don't like the plan, feel free to wander off for a while while we do what needs to be done\"\n\n\"No. I know the plan, and I won't let you go through with it. We *must* rescue those slaves\"\n\nCN Ranger is pissed. The plan is perfect, clean, simple, poetic even. What's it matter if a few peasants die in the process? Anyway, surely a couple will float to the top well enough.\n\nBut no. Paladin puts his foot down and refuses to allow the plan to happen unless we can come up with a way to get the slaves out first. So in comes Plan B, we go in fighting, use the element of surprise to get the advantage, get as many slaves out as possible and bail, the idea being that without the slaves we can put the foundry out of action long enough to impact production, and our simply knowing about it will likely cause BBEG to shift gears or something. Stupid plan, but whatever, Paladin likes it.\n\nThe plan goes off exactly as you'd expect. We charge in swords drawn ready to kick arse and CN Ranger can't shoot for shit. Seriously, couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from point blank range. The Fighter and the Paladin are getting into the thick of it, trying to do some damage but that armour is just too strong. Rogue is sneaking around to the slaves trying to get them to flee but those poor fuckers are emaciated and completely terrified, they're not moving a muscle.\n\nPaladin does the first useful thing he's ever done and attempts to rally the slaves to our aide.\n\n\"Fight! Fight with us! Fight for your freedom!\"\n\nA handful of the poor bastards feel a stir in their hearts and spring into action, mobbing at least one guard to keep the numbers one-on-one for the rest of us, but in short order they too are getting smote and the Paladin and Fighter are taking heavy damage.\n\nI recognise the plan's failure and call retreat, and we turn tail and run, getting one or two of the braver slaves out with us.\n\nLater, after getting far enough away to avoid pursuit, we licked our wounds and tried to come up with a new plan. Luckily, CN Ranger had that sorted as well. In the night, he successfully tied up the Paladin and recruited the others into digging the trench. It worked especially well as we'd dug the trench *under* the stone door so as to ensure no one could escape. The tide came in, the cave was flooded, the foundry destroyed, we left victorious and untied the Paladin, who was super pissed at us but decided it would be better not to attempt to smite us and simply pray for the dead and try to steer us down more a righteous course from then on.\n\nTo this day, I've hated Paladins. Bloody goody-two-shoes nearly got us all killed so he could play hero.",

It is intended to be a level 1-20 campaign which does not get bogged down by most chaotic/evil bs and other nonsense, really just trying to play the game to the max. It is all allowed 3.5 but we use mostly core for ease of gameplay. So WAFA;\n\nIt was a dark rainy knight. Tobias Sands, Paladin of Vadderung, has been forced to flee his home city of Samarkand and his conclave of paladins by street gangs he had foolishly attempted to convert. His flight led him down a forest path too a set of unadorned wooden doors set in the side of a large stone monastery obviously dedicated to his own god vadderung. Upon knocking on the door, he is greeted by the cleric of vadderung Luna Labelle.\n\nBoth he and her are playing very piously good characters, the way they should be played. However they can never lie without losing class abilities. They have good stats and good wealth. Also are level one, with typical core stuff, power attack for pally, and spell focus conjuration for cleric)\n\nLuna took Toby to the Prior, Prior Marshall, who welcomed him and offered him shelter, and Tobias was introduced to Brother Torm the Monasteries expert on Aracana (and teacher to luna who does in fact have maxed ranks in knowledge aracna). In the morning, Brother Havelock, the librarian came to the two of tem and told them about an archeological dig under the monastery that had reached a strange door and he wanted them to look at it.\n\nHowever before they could do so they were summoned by Prior Marshall and told of strange happenings in the town of iskington to the east, where apparently cattle were being rustled, and then drained of blood inside ritualistic circles, with no attempt to take the meat, apparently by primitive goblin tribes.\n\nThe big damn heroes decided the town of iskington was more important and set off at a fast clip, Luna on her trusty horse Poppyseed, and Toby on his powerful Destrier Smiter. However on the way they ran afoul of the Dangerous Highwayman Murray.\n\nThis was the first encounter of the campaign against a couple brigands. In the spur of the moment I had one claim to be the \"dreaded highwayman murray.\" They captured him but his compatriots made off with the horse smiter forcing the paldain into the humiliating role of walking with the prisoner.\n\nOOC: the highwayman murray was an npc i really like who offered lewd suggestions to luna, snotty remarks to toby and was an all around asshole. Also every single npc they met had heard of and was awed by the badit murrays exploits.\n\nAnyway, they are welcomed as heroes in Iskington because they bring the bandit murray and information is readily supplied leading to the cows and such. Although they have no ranks in survival, the paldins diplomacy skills introduce them to red the ranger who will let them know the location of the goblin camp if they help him clear out some spiders in the forest. Which they do, and are suitably impressed by a 6th level rangers 2 weapon fighting style. Which is neccessary since they have to fight the 4 medium sized spiders while red takes the large one.\n\nRed reveals the goblins but can not attack them both due to his wounds and other obligations with greater sources of evil.\n\nPart 2 begins with the assault on the goblin camp",

        "text": "So to start this story, 3 things you must know: the astral box, the world's history, and our party's history.\n\nSo the astral box is this weird enemy, that has changed in our campaign from its first encounter, but now when it appears it will cause a random effect (usually bad) determined by a dice roll. Our party wizard found out he could summon one for a moment (long enough for effect to activate) if he used prestidigitation to turn something blue. Our characters were extremely annoyed when he did this.\n\n The world that we live in is actually the same world our previous campaign was in, but in the future. In the previous campaign, we had found what are called Terra cards, which had strange magical properties. Each of us had 2-3 characters in this campaign managed by a guild system, so we had a fairly large group.\n\nNow for the characters, our group started with just 3, invoker, a barbarian-fighter, and I, a warlock-bard.\nThe invoker is a shardmind (sentient rock), his name, Heliotrope, was created by asmodius (essentially satan) to collect the terra cards, so asmodius could revive an ancient god, and overthrow the gods to rule the world. Our old guild from last campaign had these cards, and so he goes off to kill them, and kills them all except for sparrowhawk, a bard pixie (that's not really that important though). he doesn't succeed in getting the cards though (can't remeber why), and therefore goes searching on his own. Heliotrope is, quite obviously by now, evil.\n\nour fighter is a genasi (elemental) named Vul'shia. she was a gladiator who earned her freedom, and is in the loop about Heliotrope being with satan, and helps Heliotropes cause, as it benefits her. Vul'shia is evil, not in a sense that she wants to see the world burn, but instead that she will do basically ANYTHING if it benefits her.\n\nthen there's me, the pixie warlock-bard named Sparrowhawk Fanri IV (sparrowhawk for short). I am descended from the sparrowhawk from the old campaign and, as our family line consist of bard-adventurers, I go off to join a party when I come of age. I am a lousy bard in general (hence the whole part warlock thing) and therefore was insulted in my youth by my family. I am also very small, even for pixie standards (5 in, and 0.8 lbs), and therefore was made fun of even more. This caused me to have a chip on my shoulder, and to prove myself, I trained to be extremely intimidating, and am therefore the most intimidating part of the party. I am the only good character in our party at the beginning, and run into some initial disagreements with Heliotrope, but still end up joining the party.\n\nour fourth member joined later. He is a eladrin wizard named aquilius, who really likes to turn things blue. He is also good, so when he joined the party I automatically latched on to him, and our party kind of split into two groups, Heliotrope and Vul'shia, and then Aquillius and I.\n\nBefore the main events of this story happen, Heliotrope and I started basically just talking to each other (at this point I basically trusted him and we were even kind of friends), and I get a vague idea of his past, and immediately call him out on it. He tries to lie, but I catch him, and use intimidation to get a little more information out of him.\n\nHe also lies to me some more along the way, needles to say, our characters both basically hate each other, but keep each other around because we are useful to one another.\n\nfast forward a little, and we are facing the boss of a dungeon, it was a giant slime with a fish in the middle. While no one was able to get the fish, and were only able to get the slime, I was able to get ongoing damage to the fish. During this encounter, Helioptrope lies to me again. The way he says the lie is kind of dumb as well, the reasons why he did and why it was dumb would take too long to explain sadly, but needless to say, I call him out on it.  The slime also kills Aquilius, my best friend at this point. Soon after, the ongoing damage kills the fish, and the slime turns white and begins to expand.\n\nWe grab Aquilius's body and get the hell out of there. We end up outside the dungeon looking at it across a river. The slime then begins to leak out of the dungeon, and the guards around us can see it. The guards ask us what that was, we tell them we don't exactly know, and I convince them to go gather all the other guards, because it might just try to kill us, and so the guards run off and leave just the party.\n\nWe then start talking about what we are going to do with Aquilius, eventually Heliotrope, Vul'shia, and the spirit of Aquilius have a conversation with asmodious. They convince asmodious to give Aquilius a contract. The contract basically states that Aquilius could gain another chance at life, but if ever asmodious were to ask him to do something, Aquilius must do it. Aquilius, despite being good, decides he still wants to live and excepts the contract. At this point the slime has stopped expanding, and has simply died.\n\nOnce he is revived, we talk for a while. We then realize that I am once again outnumbered by people who worked with or for asmodious. Aquilius is kind of sad about this, but he still is technically good, and on my side, unless of course asmodious asks him not to be. The DM then off-handily mentions that there is one effect of the astral box that makes everyones alignment change to good. Aquilius, even though ther is a only a 1% of getting it, and the astral box never helping so far goes for it.\n\nAquilius turns three sticks blue, they fuse and form a astral box. The box's effect is that we all become pissed at each other. Also remember, this group is already dysfunctional, and so this effect really just enhanced these feelings. I then shouted at heliotrope something to the effect of: \"you know what screw this, you just keep on lying to me and you suck Heliotrope\" and charge him., not hitting, but still initiating the fight.\n\nHeliotrope then throws a Molotov Cocktail at me, and sets me on fire. Due to a previous encounter (a story for another day), I am afraid of fire. I fail my will roll, and begin to freak out running everywhere and begin to set stuff on fire.\n\nThis is when the guards return.\n\nThe guards find a all out brawl between our group with fire everywhere, and the DM doesn't even bother doping an encounter, and just says \"the scene automatically shifts from one of you brawling, to one of you sitting in a jail cell, and the doors sliding closed.\"....Great.\n\nWe then apologize to one another, and discuss how we are going to get out. When a guard walks by I try to use my high diplomacy score to convince him that we should be let go, but I roll a bloody one. Instead of explaining things to him clearly, I instead begin to bang on the wall, and press my face and tongue up against the prison door. The guard then s=tells me I must go to solitary confinement for being rowdy, and puts me in a small glass jar and puts me in a different room.\n\nSo yeah, all in all, dysfunctional groups are fun.... I guess?",

Continued story from [here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2jouvh/attack_on_dragon_chapter_1/)\n\nInformation for the public disclosure;\n\nThe Military Hierarchy-\nThe King, Ruler of all\n\nThe Lord General, Commander of all Military Regiments\n\nThe Grand Marshals, one in charge of each regiment, scout, garrison, and humanity guard.\n\nLance Marshals, the lieutenant leaders of each regiment\n\nThe Marshals, in charge of key components of each regiment. There are only four to a regiment.\n\nKnight Captains\n\nSquad Leaders\n\nPrivates\n\n[The Group!](http://imgur.com/gallery/UaCz1/new)\n\nRemes was gonna be the city to celebrate the coming 117th Cadets regiment into true soldiers. Their training was done, and the top ten of the class had been selected. Jon Volstein went to visit his family again before joining up, and the PCs got to know their NPC allies a little better.\n\nRemes itself was a border city, built up tall and strong to defend against dragons. The cities main focal point was the Grand Chapel Cathedral, church and fortress to the people here. This is where the graduating Cadets will be inducted.\n\nTo accommodate the safety of the city, Grax Cannons were brought in from around the world. Massive, seven barrelled monstrosities designed to turn a dragon spawn into corpses. Only fourteen were made due to their expense, and ten were brought to Remes, wheeled along in massive carts by four horses each. The Scout Regiment top brass brought a contingency of their soldiers to scout outside the walls, to ensure no dragons incoming. Their excursion was behind schedule, and they were due in by nightfall for the ceremony. \n\nJean Louise got into an argument with Thomas Bronson, whose arrogance about his victory set her off, but backed down when she learned that like her, he intended to join the scout regiment. \n\nMarie Gilbert filched and stole everything she could get her hands on, rifling through peoples pockets and lifting gold, trinkets and valuables. In the end. she turned over all her loot to the young monk Dumont Berran, and walked away without a word; leaving the PCs confused.\n\nBarclay Lemont argued against Clarice Remont, trying to get her to join the Humanity guard instead of the Scout Regiment. The PCs took her side, and Barclay was embarrassed. Jean and Clarice bonded, and she was nicknamed “Red and Stormy”, due to her ginger hair and Barbarian 3.\n\nHugo Victor went off to find his father, who would surely be here. \n\nIt was late afternoon when the dragon appeared. George Loveleaf and Jon Volstein were drinking and celebrating throughout the city when they spotted Leo Barson, one of the top ten, wearing his 3DMG and acting… suspiciously. They followed him, tracking him through the streets, cornering him in an alleyway. His options run out, in a desperate panic, he shifts.\n\nIt’s a panic of dice rolls as the newly formed gigantic sized Redspawn shifter attacks Jon and George. In their rush to overcome him, Jon rushes for the back of the creature’s neck, weapon in hand. He takes more than 60 damage from the Dragon’s fist, and dies, thrown to the distance. George tumbles his best, and rushes away as the creature rampages through the city. A bellowing crash sounds as the gates to Remes are broken open, and the dragons pour in.\n\nHugo Victor rushed to the barracks to suit up. The dragons had come in and people were in panic. No one had rung the bell that signalled a dragon attack, he wondered if anyone even knew across the city. As he reached the barracks the Red Dragonspawn was already there, destroying his way through the building. Hugo ran as cadets were slaughtered left and right trying to drop the Redspawn. \n\nThe Cadets that could banded together to strike at the creature while it was still alone. Jean Louise, Charles Winningson, Dumont Berran, Clarice Remont, and Edran Thorstein rushed the Redspawn, scoring a critical hit. But it wasn’t dropped, and swung back. Jean avoided it’s attack, and something distant caught the creature’s attention. The squad retreated when they had a chance.\n\nJean Louise, Charles Winningson, Dumont Berran, Clarice Remont, and Edran Thorstein whipped away from the barracks as the monster raged. The bell had not been rung. Seeing the carnage that lay before them, they resolved to at least ring the bell, and warn the rest of the city at once. Blasting 3DMG cables as they traversed the city, they kept to close alleys and high rooftops to avoid dragonspawn encounters. The group made their way to the bell tower and found it surrounded by Dragonspawn. Seven Black Dragonspawn. They faltered at the edge of the group, but Jean resolved to kill them all. They rushed forwards, and a Draconic claw pulled Clarice from the sky, and shoved her into a Dragon’s maw. Jean rebounded to kill the dragon, but another snapped her up in it’s jaws. Charles Winningson made a dash for Jean, held captive in a Dragon’s mouth, but was crushed by a dragon’s massive hand. Dumont stood frozen in place by fear. Only Edran, shaken and terrified, burst his way into the tower. Several Garrison soldiers cowered inside, too afraid to climb the tower and ring the bell. \n\nHugo Victor rushed unarmed through the fray. At a dead soldier he stopped to undo their 3DMG, and claim their sword. A Dragon rounded the corner, and he was forced to flee. Running through the city he took refuge with a stray cadet inside a house. A dragonspawn loomed overhead, and as they huddled and Hugo furiously attempted to don his 3DMG, it struck! Tearing through the wall it ripped the cadet out of the house. Hugo ran, leaping through the alleys to avoid his pursuer. It followed, and Hugo led it through another house. In the process, it tore through the supports, smashing it’s massive head through. As Hugo leapt out, the building collapsed upon it. Hugo’s 3DMG was still not ready as the building stirred. With his 3DMG improperly donned, he shot up to the second floor, snapping his ankle in the process, and stood poised to strike at the dragons neck as it came through the floor. Natural 20. (As a side note, Hugo’s player cried havoc and threw his dice at the table, rambling about his options and fate.)\n\nHugo ran for cover, limping through the streets as another Dragonspawn set it’s eyes on him. He took cover in the nearest basement he could find. It pursued him, smashing it’s way through the house and collapsing rubble atop Hugo. Stuck with a broken leg and no 3DMG capabilities, Hugo collapsed as the Black Dragonspawn reached to grab him. A massive metallic fist crumpled the Dragon’s skull and sent it flying. As Hugo pulled himself out of the wreckage, he saw a massive metallic purple dragonspawn fighting the other dragons, and winning.",

        "text": "So this is the story of my first (real) game session. I had briefly tried d&amp;amp;d 4e with my roommate in military training, but that pretty much included character creation, and a \"we have a few minutes to kill, try fighting this.\"  Not a real experience, in my book. \n\nAfter I came home from training, I decided I wanted to give it a real shot. I knew some of my friends played, so I asked them if I could tag along at some point. The following Saturday, there I was.\n\nThe group was experimenting with new systems at the time, and they were trying out one called Fantasy Craft at that point. With a bit of help, I made a dwarven fighter (or whatever the equivalent class was, this was a number of years ago at this point). In my mind, all dwarves are Scottish (that was true even before the LotR movies came out, they just solidified it), so I played him as a drunk Scotsman. The gm even rolled with that, having the party find me drunk in a ditch, completely nude, with no memory of the night before. \n\nSo we go on our way. Go do whatever it was that we were supposed to do (most of the adventure was pretty standard, iirc), yada yada.  Then we come to the bbeg fight. The bbeg is some sort of giant worm creature, and it's Mage handler. In the first round, the worm grapples me in it's mouth. Fortunately, it failed it's attempt to swallow me whole. \n\nUnfortunately, the worm (or it's handler, still a little unclear as to how much control he exerted) realized that, while it had virtually no chance of succeeding at a swallow... I had virtually no chance of breaking it's grapple. And since it was significantly bigger/stronger than me... It decided to use me as a club. \n\nThat's right,  this gigantic worm picked me up, and started using me to beat up the rest of the party. Of course, I was taking damage too... So I was almost dead when they finally killed the worm. \n\nBut this wasn't just any giant worm. That'd be too easy. Nope, this was an EXPLODING giant worm. When killed, it did half it's xp value in damage to everything with a certain radius. It's xp value was 97. We were level one. And I was at the epicenter of the blast, about to take roughly 30-40x as much damage as I had hp left. \n\nFortunately, Fantasy Craft has a little rule table in the back called \"cheating death\". In essence, if the player can come up with a good explanation as to why his character should have survived, the gm can choose to allow the character to survive, albeit with a defect/handicap chosen randomly from a table. \n\nAs soon as that rule was pointed out to me, I made up some story about the blast going out from the creatures outer edges. Given that I was inside his mouth at the time, I should be pretty well protected, since the blast is originating from around me and going outward, not inward. It was a tad on the weak side, but the gm accepted it. So instead of getting incinerated, I was propelled through the air.  Since we weren't planning on running this again, the gm said I was propelled several miles through the air, all my armor was blown off, and I eventually awakened exactly as the party had found me... Naked in a ditch, with no memory of the night before. ",

This feeling is now familiar. You once again find yourself lying down in the middle of a bright white room. You sit up and can see In the middle of the wall in front of a large shiny black surface. The surface flickers and bursts into life and colour, a man dressed in a green suit and red tie starts dancing to some light ‘game show’ music on the screen, he has bright yellow hair that appears to be stuck to his head and bright white teeth. With a cheesy grin on his face starts singing:\n\n“Peeps of the Sanctum, Listen to this tale, Once this world was free from order and it began to fail. The Three rose from the Light of the Universe and bought us back alive. Now the Three are giving you a chance to surely Thrive!”\n\nNow speaking in a cheesy game show hosts voice while the music continues to play in the background\n\n“Welcome to the game show with the most! ‘Reason for your life’ I ammmmm your host, the one, the only…. Joooohnnnny Threeeeeeeee”\n\nYou get to your feet as the music abruptly ends and you can hear clapping and cheering from what sounds like an audience.\n\nJohnny signals for the audience to be quiet and walks to the centre of the screen and turns to face you with a serious expression. He seems to be looking you directly in the eye. \n\n“Hello Peep 1024, I hope your enjoying your stay in Unit 67, if not it might just kill ya…” he erupts in fake laughter which seems to extend from his stomach all the way to his eye brows, the audience also laughs along. The laughter abruptly cuts off and he once again holds a serious expression.\n \n“Now before we begin let me give you a quick rundown on the rules. Below your feet you will notice on the floor there are three circles” \n\nYou look down and the floor has changed, there are three circles, one green, one yellow and one red, they are just large enough to stand in. They have writing in them “Affirmative”, “Negative” and “Irrelevant”.\n\n“OK 1024,  I will ask you a series of questions after each you will have 30 ticks to stand in the circle that correctly answers the question. Failure to stand in a circle within the allotted time frame will result in termination, incorrect answers will result in termination.” \n\nHe waves his hands in front of him and out of the air a card seems to appear, like a cheap magic trick. He begins to read from the card.\n\n“Question 1. Is your designation Peep 1024?” A bright red timer appears on the screen and starts counting down from 30 ticks. The horrific game show music is back and Johnny Three starts once again dancing around sending the audience wild with excitement.\n\nThis seems like an easy question, you have been told you are Peep 1024, it is one of the only things you know for sure, the black and green transmission screen told you so. So you stand on the Affirmative circle. \n\nThe timer ends and the music stops. Johnny Three runs up the screen so his face fills it and bright white teeth are almost blinding, in hushed tone he says “OK folks, That was just the warm up, lets see how 1024 did\" with a massive grin on his face, he yells \"1024, Yooooouuuuuuu Thhhhhrrrriiiivvvveee!” and you can hear cheering and clapping from the audience. \n\nJohnny then spins round and seems to appear back in his original position with the camera panned out, he has another card in his hand. Silence fills the air.\n\n“Question 2. Starting at star quadrant 14 Gamma 5 Sigma 6, if a solid object travels 4 hundred million light years in any one direction, will it collide with any other solid objects?”\n\nThis question at first leaves you stunned, how are you supposed to know that!? The timer is ticking down rapidly, it currently stands at 20 ticks left and you have not even started to answer the question. You stand there for another 10 ticks and are beginning to get an odd feeling of stress and panic which you have never experienced before. You shut your eyes and wait for termination.\n\nSuddenly your mind is filled with information as your subconscious serves up the answer. The human home world of earth is located directly in that star quadrant, there are multiple star systems in striking distance of that quadrant and 400 million light years in any direction will almost certainly hit something. However this question is flawed in many ways and strikes you as largely irrelevant as there is no end objective and not enough information to possibly make an informed decision. You look at the timer 3 ticks remaining. Quickly you jump onto the irrelevant circle.\n\nThe timer ends and the music stops. Johnny slowly walks up to the camera, his shoulders hunched and shaking his head. When gets close enough that only his head is in frame he looks up, winks, and a broad smile slowly grows on his face. \nHe says into the camera “That was close one! but Yooooouuuuuuu Thhhhhrrrriiiivvvveee!” the audience erupts into wild applause, Johnny spins around and once again is back in his starting position with a question card in his hand.\n\nHe speaks in his jovial tone “This is the final question 1024 my boy, Good luck, the whole Sanctum is behind you! Question 3”\n\nJohnny pauses for effect and then continues “Are you afraid of termination?”\n\nThis question puzzles you, you have not really ever considered that you were alive. If you were to not be alive would you even know? How can you be scared of that? You do not want to be terminated but are not afraid of it...This is an odd confusing question.\n\n You make up your mind, and you stand on the Negative circle.\n\nThe timer ends and the music stops. The world fades to black, the last thing you remember is the audience going wild and the creepy game show music playing in the background.  Johnny Three smiling and dancing and you can make out the word \"Thrive\".\n",

Our DM had gone full custom campaign, with NPCs, a world map, world history, the whole deal. We had only just started with our freshly rolled Lvl. 1's and our DM was only vaguely prepared for what was going to happen. This is the story of how I went from apprehensive to completely sold on tabletop RPGs. I had rolled a CN Half-Elf Ranger, as that's what I had that one time I played NWN.\n\nOur story takes place in this worlds only real town, a small port town that existing pretty much solely to serve as a trade centre for the large mining operation further inland. As such, there's not a lot going on, and the town guard have turned to drink and corruption to overcome the intense boredom of their lives, and everyone else lives pretty much in fear of either the town guard, or the criminals who prosper due to the entirely ineffectual guard force.\n\nIt is night, the sky is cloudy with very little moonlight, and the party crosses a stone bridge over the deep, fast flowing river into town. The Ranger surveys the scene, staying on point as always. It is late and the sound of revelry emanates from a nearby tavern. The streets are empty, save for a single man, in a guards uniform, drunkenly slumped over the edge of a fountain in the town square,  throwing up into the stagnant water. The Ranger notices that the guard is dressed in rather heavy mail and still has his sword at his hip.\n\nWithout so much as a word to the rest of the party, the Ranger walks up to the clearly inebriated guard and forces his face under the stagnant, vomit-filled water of the fountain. Too drunk to put up any meaningful resistance, the guard ceases to struggle in short order. The ranger takes the guards sword and a handful of gold coins, before hoisting the body over his shoulder, carrying it back to the bridge, and dumping it into the river, the armour weighing down the body until it is dragged out to sea. The sword would later be sold for some coin. The body was never discovered, and there were no witnesses to the crime save for the other members of the party, who, if they had a problem with it, didn't seem to show it.\n\nAnd that's the story of the first 10 minutes I ever played of Dungeons and Dragons, and how I fell in love with the game that could realise my every whim, limited only by my imagination, and the luck of the dice.",

        "text": "Hey everybody! So, I’ve been DMing a long running game of 3.5 set in an Attack on Titan Universe. I asked around if anyone wanted to hear the story; and you guys were great! So here it is, Attack on Dragon!\n\nHouse Rules in effect:\n\nCharacters will graduate Cadets at level 3. \n\nAll weapons are automatically +5. Throw a rock? It’s a +5 rock. Makes everyone better, and more mortal. \n\nNo full magic classes (For reasons I’ll reveal later.)\n\nIf you die, remake character at level 3.\n\nThe Gear- \n\nThe staple of the cool Attack on Titan setting. 3DMG (Three Dimensional Maneuver Gear.) Gives every player a fly speed equal to their Base speed +5ft per 5 points in a balance check or concentration check.\n\nThe Blades- Mercurial Keen Longsword. d8 dmg (19-20/ X4) A doozy of a weapon. Get close and score a critical for an assured kill.\n\n[Map!](http://imgur.com/gallery/xos29/new)\n\nFirst, the dragons. They came from who knows where, who can remember how long ago. But they pushed humanity back into the confines of a single massive walled area. But winged, fire breathing dragons are few and far between. Their mindless armies are composed of gigantic, humanoid abominations with the dragon subtype. They lurch and eat and smash without tactics, but they are endless. Only the walls and cannonfire keep them out. But you get this by now.\n\nThe three walls of Maria, Rose, and Sina and intercut by four walls that span from Sina to Maria in a large X, cutting the holdings of Humanity into 9 sections, so if a city is breached, the dragons must break more walls to be able to expand.\n\nStraussberg was the first city to fall. A massive blue dragon spawn shattered the gates to the city, and breached the inner walls. Some fleeing refugees [drew what they saw.](http://imgur.com/gallery/7H0bQCO/new)\n\nThe game started out slow. Several of my veteran players alongside a few new faces. They were all at boot camp, and each of them had played at least once before, but Cadets was the first time everyone was playing in the same room. Everyone joined up with the 117th Cadet Training squad. Some had seen the show; some had not.\n\n I couldn't have written it better myself, one of the new girls playing with us had baked cookies for everyone. I waited, bided my time until their drill instructor was grilling them all down for weakness, and she reached over and ate a cookie.\n\nI guess we know who potato girl is gonna be. When she finally got back from running, I had all the players talk and introduce themselves for the first time. \n\nThe Player Characters!\n\nCharles Winningson- A monk from a local monastery. A big guy, and a braggart. Left his monastery with his friend Dumont Berran (NPC) after Straussberg to follow Jean Louise, for some reason.\n\nLyanna- Cookie Girl. A young orphan from Straussberg, escaped the wreckage, but had to leave her friends, Bernard Leshay (NPC) and Alex Craise (NPC), behind. They’re likely dead now.\n\nHugo Victor- The son of Garrison Marshal Garant Victor. A young man from a military family. His older brother Marcus is already in the Garrison, and he plans to follow in their footsteps. He lived miles from Straussberg, but the dragon’s breach left his home in danger, and he had to evacuate. He hasn’t seen his father in two years.\n\nJon Volstein- A young man from the Western wall city of Remes. Aims to rank top ten and join the Humanity Guard.\n\nEdran Thorn &amp; Jean Louise- Two orphans living in Straussberg. Both young. Jean swears vengeance on all dragonkind, and aims to join the Scout Regiment. Edran goes where Jean does.\n\nGeorge Loveleaf- A survivor of Straussberg, and one of the eldest there. Aims to join the Humanity Guard and never see dragons again.\n\nToo many players to run a game? Yes. I used a few tricks to keep the game moving, challenges all the players attempted at once, skill checks everyone had to make. \n\nHugo failed basic 3DMG testing, knocking himself out in the process. Dumont Berran helped him through the night, training his balance check to pass the challenge.\n\nCharles Winningson quickly became the group whipping boy, made to run miles after miles to get sticks from the nearest forest. Eventually he stockpiled sticks to give to the boot sergeant. This gambit did not work.\n\nLyanna eventually gave in, and confessed to the group that she only survived Straussberg by sacrificing her two best friends to the dragons, tripping Alex to give herself more time to run, and knocking Bernard Leshay unconscious to steal his food, and leaving him when the dragon assault came. Bernard Leshay survived, and is part of the 117th training group.\n\nCharles Winningson and Jon perfected a technique to propel the both of them forward to attack using their 3DMG. They named this maneuver the \"Jon-Winningson\", and became the best of friends.\n\nThe time came for written examinations, the time to study the weaknesses of dragon spawn. Their Armor Class is 35, 25 touch and 10 flat footed. DR 20, overcome by flat-footed. That’s right, friends. The only way to overcome the 20 DR of dragonspawn is to catch them flat footed, and slice through the back of their necks. Fast healing 20, by the way, so finish them off quickly. Edran excelled in dragon studies, acing the class. Here, Hugo noted something odd about Jean. Her eyes never made contact, and she rarely looked at someone to talk. Throwing a rock at her from behind, Hugo tested Jean’s sight. Jean has blindsight, and no natural vision.\n\nThe Classes came to a finish. After a full two years of training, the top ten of the class was revealed.\n\n10.Dumont Berran (NPC)\n\n9.Bernard Leshay (NPC)\n\n8.Marie Gilbert (NPC)\n\n7.Charles Winningson\n\n6.Leo Barson (NPC)\n\n5.Barclay Lemont (NPC)\n\n4.Clarice Remont (NPC)\n\n3.Hugo Victor\n\n2.Jean Louise\n\n1.Thomas Bronson (NPC)\n\nThe top ten had been determined, and the cadets were sent off to the West-most city of Remes; where the top brass of each regiment would participate in a ceremony to persuade each recruit to join their side. Remes was chosen as it is the farthest possible city from the breached city of Struassberg. \n\nThen the dragons struck.\n\nEDIT: The second chapter is up, [right here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2juoxc/attack_on_dragon_chapter_2_xpost_from_rdnd/)",

        "text": "Today I am going to regale you with the tale of my favorite character I've ever played, Bruce, \"The Impossible\" \"The Awesome\" \"The Almighty\" Zária. Or simply, Bruce “The Random”.\n\nBruce is a character that has now spanned 3 versions of D&amp;D, each incarnation building on the character and getting crazier with the random things that happen to him. He is so awesome a character, I even wrote him into the story I'm writing, albeit slowly. (Link at bottom of post to a story excerpt of his novel introcution that I posted on a writing forum a while back)\n\nThe first incarnation of Bruce, and the real reason I hold the character near and dear to my heart, was my very first campaign of D&amp;D ever. About 11 years ago, I made a friend in college (/u/inorganicangelrosiel). We got to talking and before long she mentioned that some friends of hers were getting together for D&amp;D some weekend. I expressed my jubilance, as I had never played the tabletop version of D&amp;D and always wanted to, but no one I knew played. She went and asked the group if it was ok, and it was so I was invited.\nI rolled up a character once I got there. The DM said that I could roll any race combination, and since I played almost every single D&amp;D video game in existence (Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, Temple of Elemental Evil) I was comfortable rolling a halfling wizard from the get go. Honestly, I forget what spells I started with, it doesn’t matter. What matters was that I took a small crossbow as my weapon in case I ran out of spells.\n\nAnd now the game:\n----------------------------------\nThe DM didn’t want to waste time trying to introduce me properly, since it was my first time. The party was approaching some ruined castle for some reason or another at the end of the last campaign. The party consisted of me as a Halfling wizard, my friend as a drow wizard, a homebrewed dragonborn fighter (before they were an official race) and a human paladin.\n\nBruce was inexplicably there, just pretending to have left the town with everyone else. The door to the keep was, understandably, locked and too big to force at our low level (Bruce was level 1, they were all level 4 I think). The only other noticeably feature was a nearby well.\n\nIt was a rather small well, and the adventurers seem to have noticed the small Halfling that had tagged along with them and said ‘He’ll fit!” and promptly threw him down the well. Note: Bruce has a long history of abuse.\n\nDisoriented, Bruce looked around the bottom of the well and lo and behold, there was a switch. He flipped it and the gates to the castle opened. Thankfully the other party members let down a rope to let poor Bruce out.\n\nThis keep was filled with all sorts of evil random monsters, and I don’t quite recall what the first few fights were exactly, all I know is every time Bruce went to cast a spell…. It failed. Either due to a failed concentration check or monsters passing their saves, nothing hit at all.\n\nFinally, it reached the last straw. We encountered an orc, and my first spell failed against him. Bruce sighed and took out his crossbow. “We’ll just do this the old fashioned way.” He said. I said ‘Aimed shot, in his nuts’.\n\nThe DM looked at me In disbelief. “You’ve been missing all day, and you want to do an aimed shot? “Yup” I replied. “Proceed.” Replied the DM.\n\nNat 20. The DM laughed. “Roll to confirm the critical”. Nat 20. “Holy shit. Roll it again. If you get 3 20’s in a row, you instant kill whatever you are fighting” (I Think this was a house rule, but I still use it to this day). I rolled a third time. Nat 20. Everyone’s jaws dropped. The DM cleared his throat. “You loose a bolt from your crossbow. It hits the orc squarely in his balls and he just explodes. His genitals just explode outward with such force it rips the rest of him to shreds. He is dead.”\n\nThe DM sighed. “Enjoy it while it lasts… You will never roll 3 20’s in a row like that again”.\n\nLittle did he know…. The next major room we encountered a green ooze. You know, those big green gelatinous cubes that just eat your character and slowly digest them? Yeah. It quickly ensnared one of our party members, and I was still running on the high of my instant kill the previous battle. When it came my turn I whipped out my crossbow.\n\n“Really? Its an ooze, a crossbow bolt is not going to do anything. You really want to use your spells here…” suggested the DM.\n\n“No,” I replied. “I want to shoot it with my crossbow.”\n\n“Whatever,” The DM replied. Nat 20 Nat 20 Nat 20. Everyone around the table flipped out.\n\n“The crossbow bolt goes soaring into the ooze, and it just explodes. Gooey green sludge flies every which way and coats the room. The fighter in the middle, freed from his gooey prison, looks around baffled.”\nHe turns to me, “I can’t fucking believe you did it again. Seriously, if that happens again, I’m done. I quit.”\nWell, we finished that dungeon, I kept casting spells, some of them hit, some didn’t. At level up I took an enhancing spell and a feat to help me with the crossbow since that seemed to be my TRUE source of damage.\n\nAdventurers were had. There were no more of those crazy triple hits, but it seemed to stay consistent that I could do decent damage with my crossbow but not be able to hit with any spells.\n\nEventually, we got to a cave. Inside it was a massive red dragon guarding an immense hoard of treasure. While the treasure was tempting, the DM intended for us to attempt to talk to the dragon, and get a quest from it since we were only level 6 or 7. Either that or run away. But Bruce wasn’t afraid. HE smiled and aimed his crossbow. The DM warned me that it was an elder dragon, and that any act of hostility on my part would cause it to eat me, rather quickly. Bruce shrugged and fired. \n\nNat 20. \n\n“No, you aren’t going to..” The DM cried.\n\n Nat 20 \n\n“No, it’s statistically impossible for this to happen to you a third time. You cannot insta kill this dragon.” \n\nNat 20. \n\n“That’s it, I quit. Seriously, I’m done.”\n\nThe DM wound up giving Bruce a tower shield that magically floated in front of him, giving a permanent +2 defense bonus, but we only played one more session before, you guessed it, the DM quit.\n\nI doubt it was my fault, he actually went to the military and we never played with him again, but ever since then tales of Bruce’s epicness have been retold, and how he was able to kill an elder dragon with one well -placed crossbow bolt…\n\nAs promised, the link to his intro in my novel. I will regale you with the tale of Bruce’s 2nd incarnation, which, dare I say it, was more epic than the first.\n\nhttp://mythicscribes.com/forums/showcase/598-bruce-halfling.html\n\nP.S. I may have embellished a bit on the tale. I don't know that what was said was exact, as my memory, especially of 10+ years ago, is not the best. I do clearly remember the kills I made, and the general reaction of the group.\n\nEDIT: Formatting",

You do not know who you are, where you are, you do not recall anything previous to the last minute. The black and green transmission screen you could just see when your eyes were shut is the only memory you have. \nAs your eyes adjust to the bright light around you, you find yourself lying of the floor in the middle of a perfectly square white room. The walls, ceiling and floor radiate a very bright white light. There does not appear to any entrance or exits. \n\nYou begin to pull yourself to your feet, you just about reach a crouched position when you notice out of your peripheral vision a small opening on the wall directly to your left. Before you can consciously react a small smooth round projectile fires out of the hole at high speed aiming for your head. Time seems to hang, and your body moves by instinct, with relative ease you throw yourself back down onto the ground as the projectile flies clear over your head and disappears into the opposite wall. \n\nThere is little time to lie still and contemplate what just happened. Once again instinct takes over as three more openings appear around the room, one of them on the ceiling, one directly in front and one behind you, as the projectiles begin to fly, it is as if you can see their trajectory like lines drawn in the air, you flip onto your feet and take a small side step, they fly harmlessly past. \n\nAll of this this happens in a blur. Now on your feet it is much easier to dodge the projectiles, many more openings appear and you dodge each and every one without any conscious effort. You have no time frame reference but eventually the projectiles stop. Everything goes dark again.\n",

        "text": "So we have quite ordinary, law abinding engineer named Kor. He used to have workshop in a small city, untill one of the \"best and brightest\" imperial  officer decided to search his workshop with the torch. One exploded gunpowder barrel later Kor left everything he couldn't carry with him and began  journey to the city of rebels.\n\nThere Kor managed to find himself at the local milita barracks and enlisted to guard the City. After couple of weeks he proved his badassery by shootig  giant scorpion unconcious, while dodging it's claws at the midsummer festival. Week after that he and his squadmates foiled empires bastardly covert  operation to drug everyone in the City.\n\nKor's superiors deemed his squad worthy of suicide mission and told them to kidnap one of the imperial officer from his heavily fortified camp, alive.  Those pompous idiots decided to tell that they could commandeer some of resistance's forces for this mission after couple of days. Kor however had  already managed to form quite creative plans how to return alive from the mission and gods deemed his lawfulness wanting, thus our Kor became Truly  Neutral.\n\nWhile his squadmates proved that they didn't know anything about tactics, Kor promtly gathered small force to overtake the imperial fortress. There were  assasins, local engineering guild's musketeers and mortars, some farmhands with pikes and resistance's pride and joy the Hammer of Doom cannon. After  they managed to drag the cannon near enough to the imperial fortress, Kor found out that his last visit to the local alchemist had produced some  unexpected results, he had compelling fear of water and frequent memory losses.\n\nEven with those handicaps Kor managed to pull all the forces in place and assault was flawless. Mortars blew fortres' ammostore to kingdom come along  with wallmounted heavy ballistas, musketeers massacared any troops that tried to sally from the fortress. Final strike came from the Hammer of Doom,  which evaporated good half from that fortress.\n\nThe assault ended within five minutes and Kor along squadmembers dragged that imperial officer back to their own superiors. Superiors promptly send them  to another suicide mission, though this time they gave some good revards for job well done so Kor had no problem with it. \n\nIt was quite straight forward mission. First htey needed to find the second encampment, then they needed to kidnap an another officer and bring him back  alive. Second they needed to obiliterate the whole camp becouse it contained imperium's artillery suplies. Suplies that would be used to obiliterate  resistance if left alone. Oh, and no troops for this mission, bastards...\n\nKor and his squad departed and travelled to the reqion where the second encampment had spotted last time, to search for glues. There they ran into some  assasins who supricingly didn't know anything. Kor and his new best friend integorated them thoroughly to be sure but they didn't know anything. \n\nHowever local baron and baroness were quite welcoming and helpfull. Kor felt that baroness was the most charming person that he ever had met and it  seemed that baroness felt some atttraction to Kor too. It turned out later that baron and baroness were vampires and they were promptly dealt with. Kor's  greatest regret was that he was unable to stuff baroness' body, that was pierced with a stake, to his bag of holding. ( GM was quite adamant on this one.  He didn't allow us to hack her body to pieces and store her in that way either. Bummer )\n\nThe encampment was quite easy to infiltrate into and Kor along with his friends managed to knock the Officer out cold without a sound and cast an  illusion spell so he seemed to be a bag of laudnry. While his friends went out with the officer, Kor stayed to rig timebomb to encampment's ammo depot.  To his suprice it turned out to be quite nice lake..... \n( GM calculated that the blast radius was something around 500 to 800 ft. It knocked us all away and party's Druid who was flying as an eagle started to  hate Kor for some \"odd\" reason.... that was levels 5 to 8 party size 6 to 8)\n\nKor and the rest of the team gained some promotions and were given the \"special operations team\" title, for what little good it did. Kor was more pleased  to resieve brand new double barrelled muscket and some enchanted ammonition. Then his memory failed him.\n( Kor has three different personalities LG, NN and CE, each other has no idea of others, nor do they retain any of others' memories. Ending of that  campain was played with CE and LG. CE gained some fame for creative use of silkrope, candles and grappling hook in the brothel, without whores and the  person who actualy bought them noticing a thing. I have to love successfull sneak checks... \n\nEdit: part 2 http://redd.it/2l6v65)\n",

        "text": "There was a day when the civilians respected their paramilitary superiors, but that was long, long ago. Now the security division of Space Station 13, a research station under the control of the nation-corporation Nanotresen are understaffed, unsaluted, and wildly outgunned from everything to bodysnatching changelings, traitorous crewmembers, to goddamn space wizards. There really is nothing to be done but button all twelve steel plates to your trenchcoat, belt your stunbaton, and face the crew as if none of their murderous intents phased you at all when even the prick of a syndicate pen could spell death for you.\n\nEntropoly Marksmith was one of those security officers. In fact, due to pedigree, military training, and utmost loyalty to Nanotresen, she was the Head of the Security division for Space Station 13. Seeing as there were only three other security members on a crew that currently came fully equipped with a barman, two clowns, a chef, four engineers, five medical staff, a handful of reluctant to show themself scientists, and a gaggle of thieving assistants, it wasn't exactly the most secure or accomplished of jobs, but Marksmith performs until she's the winner or dead, very little in between.\n\nAs Entropoly waited for her favorite drink, straight whiskey served by a reluctant and disappointed bartender, she heard the most grating noise to ever fall upon one's ears. \"Uguuu!~ Can I get some juiiiiice for my juiiiiice cup?~\"\n\nAnd sat next to her was a monstrosity. It was a grown woman wearing a pair of synthetic cat ears and a Japanese schoolgirl uniform. None of that was standard issue, and none of it was becoming. For the first time in her life, Entropoly was about to lose her booze.\n\nAfter stunning the awful schoolgirl with the tip of her baton and excusing herself from the bar, Entropoly went about her day. It didn't surprise her to see the warden of the brig asleep and comatose in his office, boredom taken after only ten minutes of no prisoners coming in.\n\nAfter disposing of his body by stripping off any dangerous gear and his ID before throwing him half naked in a dorm room, Entropoly went to comm the rest of security.\n\n\"This is Entropoly Marksmith reporting in. Officers, state location and current level of activity.\"\n\n\"Hey there chief. I just ate all of the donuts on the bridge and checked the medical consoles to see who is underage on the station.\"\n\nAnd then Entropoly turned her security comms off. There was really no good to hearing the rest of that story.\n\nTwenty minutes pass. The whiskey runs out, but going into the bar again means braving a disgruntled bartender and an overgrown catgirl. That was when explosions hit the station.\n\nFinally.\n\nIt was a plasma fire mixed with some sort of detonated bombs. Honestly, it was good for causing mass panic and getting emergency escape shuttles called, but the overall damage and loss of life would be negligible. Plasma fires are sucked out of hull breaches very fast, and unless someone was tending to the atmos system, it would just shoot straight out the first hole it could get with everyone in the bar safe and sound behind firelocks. Medbay was fucked though, after a cursory examination of the halls, but this widescale destruction meant one of two things... Either someone broke into atmospherics and switched some valves over *and* science start laying bombs around the station randomly at the same time or there was a full blown conspiracy with at least two, maybe three participants looking to get ahead on this little game...\n\nEntropoly strode forward, finally in her element. The whiskey bottle was discarded, the stun baton was out, and her red eyed security gas mask was on and glowing in the darkness that was now the station. Cries came through her earbud from engineering, which was likely, so she went there first...\n\nWhen she got there, it was something truly awful. At her feet was what used to be a person, what used to be a BODY even, that was now a gray husk. Its blood was sucked from its skin and it looked like a crumpled juice box. Changelings were around, and they were whoever this was.\n\nIt was a relatively quick search, actually...\n\nAs Entropoly examined the body, a cargo tech wandered out of the engineering doors and then back in, quickly ducking out of sight. A moment later, a locker is heard slamming shut...\n\nIt was an age old tactic. You lure someone in, jump at them from a locker, and then you've snapped them into a certain death as they're stunned on the floor below you. Seeing as there was an open locker near this body, it looked like a nice security red was on the menu for this xenobiological face snatcher...\n\nEntropoly grabbed a welder from the table of engineering, crept around slowly, and turned the dial at an aching pace. A tiny hiss came forth as a jet of flame erupted from the tip, burning her eyes as she was forced to look away from it...\n\nShe danced around the corner and slashed the welder against the locker, sealing it tight and just in time to hear a heavy thunking from inside, and then a piercing screech that blew the lights out nearby and shocked her comms in her ear. She quickly tore the bud out and grabbed the locker, throwing it on its side and dragging it.\n\nInside engineering was clean and pure. No blood was tracked through the highly guarded particle accelerator chamber, no debris was allowed to be left on the floor unless someone wanted the singularity engine to suck it up against the window and cause a hull breach or worse, a black hole event.\n\nAnd honestly, Entropoly knew very well what happened when too much trash was sucked into the singularity. It grew large, fast, and then started sucking up the station after breaking out of containment. It was one of the best electrical generators in the universe, but it also was cataclysmic if not tended to properly.\n\nThat didn't stop her from shoving the changeling in his locker out the maintenence airlock, throwing him into the singularity where he quickly exploded into bits of red and white chunks. Thankfully, those were cleaned up afterwards.\n\nShe quickly took stock of the situation, snagged a pair of insulated yellow gloves, and wandered out. She turned her comms back on, making the mistake of turning her security link on at the same time.\n\n\"So then I met up with her, and you wouldn't believe what kinds of thi-\"\n\nAnd off security link goes. Calling for backup wasn't worth the headache.\n\nSecurity needed some cleaning, but thankfully medbay was too fucked to justify yanking a locker full of bodies for cloning. It was getting to be around the time that a shuttle should be called, assuming now that the one main threat to the station was done. After all, a changeling was the conspiracy... It could have been the atmos tech, the cargo tech, and the scientist all at once to screw the station over. It was a tall order for one entity, but there was a lot of time...\n\nAs Entropoly walked back to the bridge to call the escape shuttle and get off of the flaming can of death, another monster struck her from the side.\n\n\"SECURITY SEMPAI! SAVE ME I AM SO SCARRRRED!~ UGUUU~\"\n\nThere was nothing better than feeling a bit of skull give way beneath a stunbaton. It *was* a nonlethal weapon meant to send a taser shot of electricity through a human adult, but it also seconded as a very heavy, very metal stick.\n\nTen minutes until shuttle arrives...\n\nThere was little left to do but search anyone suspicious, keep an ear out for changelings, and guard the bar full of people who at this point were feeling the sting of medbay as their wonder drugs of drunk and fat curing medicines were taken away. It was godawful watching a dozen fat, slubbering, stuttering adults deal with an emergency situation.\n\nIt was even worse seeing one's skin slowly inflate past his ears until he was swollen like a balloon and then... Pop...\n\nStanding where they were was a different person with the same clothes, and all around them were people screaming on the floor from the acidic blood stinging their faces.\n\nIt was a dangerous fight, but Entropoly actually managed to be the first person to beat the idiotic thing down in the horde of assistants and engineers. Honestly, even a changeling can't handle six bored, drunk NT crewmembers.\n\nSo two changelings down, though this one's body needed disposal. After all, they could survive more serious wounds and get up with a new face in a matter of minutes...\n\nEntropoly elected to encase it in a metal tomb in the middle of the bridge, handcuffed, electropacked, buckled to a chair, and breathing plasma. It felt like overkill, but the other changeling that crossed her was turned into stars so...\n\nMore explosions.\n\nFive minutes until shuttle arrives.\n\nThe hardest challenge to date was getting all of the people to the newly renovated escape wing. You can say whatever you want about engineering (mostly that they were pretty much all dead) but they damn sure know how to make five minutes of work on a broken down section of the station turn into a candlelit lounge with cushioned chairs and mahogany tables.\n\nTwo minutes until shuttle arrives.\n\nThis is the telling moment... If someone wanted to open up and start murdering, now would be the time. Too late to clone even in the best of circumstances, too late to assemble any force that wasn't already here... Any earlier and backup would arrive when you least expect it in the form of any passerby with a screwdriver, any later and your target won't finish bleeding out by the time the shuttle docks with central command.\n\nShuttle docked.\n\nSo. Fucking. Boring.\n\nShuttle launched.\n\nEveryone was on safely, lamenting the drinks that were never had or wildly overestimating their assistance in the station wide threats. The Head of Security considered arresting numerous people over claiming they incinerated changeling bodies themselves, sometimes upwards of two confirmed, soloed kills. The best case scenario was they were lying, the worst case scenario was that they murdered people under false suspicions.\n\nOne thing that bothered her was the absence of the security guard who was around the entire shift and-\n\nOh dear gods, the catgirl got on the shuttle in time. She was sitting between the last remaining engineer and a clown wearing a chicken suit. She was just being quiet so she wasn't noticed...\n\nOdd, very, very odd...\n\n\"Hey, catgirl!\"\n\n\"Huh? Me what?\"\n\n\"Are you feeling alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, just a bit hurt...\"\n\nNo one complained when the Hos chucked her out an airlock shouting something along the lines of making sure to steal the worst, most godawful speech patterns of someone when you steal their body too.\n\n\n----\n\nThat concludes my SS13 story, though it was hard to transcribe from memory as it's a game that doesn't go into type very well, and I didn't want to embellish it too much.\n\n",

Myself, hill dwarf cleric.\n\nThe story begins after a day of rabbit-punching, snake-conking adventure. We return to camp where I tie my allies up( for they could not be trusted). Cennek gave a bit of a struggle, but a nat20, a bedroll, and some rope settled the dispute.\n\nThat night, I took an uneventful first watch, followed by an equally uneventful second watch from Cennek. Gruncle was third, but Cennek's screeching and whining was not enough to wake him up. It was enough to wake me up, however, and when the orc refused to get up for his watch, I had a brilliant idea. The orc was already tied up, so I decided to spend a little bit of extra rope to tie him to a pole over the fire.\n\nIn the morning, it was discovered that the orc had somehow managed to dose off. This made me angry enough to literally push Gruncle into the fire. He rolls around taking damage well over half of his max HP, but manages to kick enough coals at me to deal damage ( I thought this was dumb, but hey, /u/SnakeSender found it logical). This warranted revenge in the form of more damage. I pull out my axe and hit him after about 3 tries(with advantage), finally incapacitating him. I then untied Cennek who healed him.We ended that long rest with one of our party members horribly injured.\n\nSince this story, both Cennek and my character have died.They tried to fight giant snakes on their own. We have been reincarnated as a ranger and a paladin.",

        "text": "I DM a not so synergetic party. In the party was a human Wizard(Cennek),  /u/adamtwo , a not so happy dwarven cleric(Addrick),  and a rougue who gives his loot back(Sai). For those you wondering where that oaf of a fighter, J (Gruncle), was from /u/adamtwo 's snake story was, he was in the corner of some room sleeping.\n\nThe group had just opened a door to room to reveal a magical darkness that their light could not pierce. Once they quelled the darkness, it revealed a mostly empty room. In the center was a medium sized glossy black-stone. Cennek was the first to go to the stone and investigate it. He picked it up and observed dwarven engravings on it (It translated to the word \"Darkness\" but he couldn't translate). He held it out for Addrick to read and translate. After reading it, A's instant reaction is to try to snatch the stone. The wizard pulled it away in time. \n\nThen the stand off commenced. Cennek proceeded to yell at Addrick trying to get the translation from him. Addrick responds by trying to exchange the translation for the stone. Cennek refuses and this is where it gets interesting. They just stood there arguing. Sai then tries to intervene and negotiate with A. He started to offer bribes using money he stole from Cennek(though Cennek did not know this at the time)While the negotiations between those two are happening Cennek is slowly inching away from Addrick to the other side of the podium getting ready to run if need be. \nSai and Addrick eventually agree that Addrick should get the stone but Cennek refused to give it up and started to back away. Addrick reacts by pulling out a rusty pickaxe and runs at Cennek with the intent of knocking him out with the blunt side. Sai pulls out a bow a proceeds to break off the tips and shoot blunt arrows at C. The stone then disappeared. Cennek and Addrick get even madder and start yelling at eachother. Sai annoyed with everyone makes a corny joke about mommy and daddy arguing and proceeds to take the Donkey(which was technically A's) and starts to walk down a hallway to a different room. \n\nAddrick sees this as an act of theft and proceeds to run after Sai yelling at him and draws his battleaxe. Sai is abel to get half-way through the hallway before he realizes the danger of the situation. He turns the donkey side ways in the hall way in hopes to block Addrick from reaching himself. Addrick not wanting to hurt the donkey, throws down his battle-axe and dives under the Donkey's legs to get to the other side. He then gets back up while he is still charging and tackles Sai. Sai get pinned at first but is later able to escape. They stand up and Addrick draws a Javelin he stole from another player in an earlier session. Then the Donkey interfered. It charged at them knocking them down and trampling both of them.This didn't discourage A. He kept persisting in  attacking H. They both stand up and prepare to fight. Then the Donkey made a second pass again knocking them both over.\n\nWhile this was happening Cennek, now at one hp after the confrontation, decides to leave. \nSai and Addrick were still going at it. The donkey had made three passes now knocking them down trying to get them to stop. Still refusing to stop, a demon appears between them. Grabs them by the throat and then they both blacked out.\n\n/u/adamtwo and I shall be posting more tails from this campaign as the come up under the the title \"The Red Campaign\"",

        "text": "((First of all the title has changed. Thorvald takes a major part in the action scenes with Jarvand taking over during the out of combat parts. Thus the name change.\n\n((Secondly, Jarvand becomes a Wizard from little to know knowledge, made possible by the experiments done on him in the backstory. Thorvald dumps almost all of his points into Strength and Dexterity. This becomes a major point later.\n\n((Finally, because I don't want to use \"Jarvand knew\" every sentence, I am going to use *Shudder* the IRL part. I'm going to try and keep it as minimal as possible but it might increase.\n\n((/rant))\n\nWe left off on Thorvald and Jarvand being forced by the Berra to go out and kill a cult of infidels. The Berra had sent out a raiding party a few days before and the duo would be used as backup.\n\nOn their new path for The Fellowship, they set off to the south to find the encampment.\n\nThe trip took several weeks, strangely nothing attacked them along the way. This was very unusual for the bandit ridden area. Thorvald thought he heard something but didn't want Jarvand to yell at him, choosing to not tell him.\n\nFinally when they reached the encampment they were awed at the size of the gargantuan fortress. Jarvand quietly pondered as to why a fortress would be used as an encampment, eventually deciding it was captured.\n\nThey searched for the raiding party quickly, wanting the reinforcements as fast as possible. Jarvand found a blood trail leading to an arm. After a bit more searching nothing else was found so they moved on.\n\nThe doors were huge, made out of iron. Nothing short of a horned troll could break in.\n\nThankfully they had Thorvald.\n\nThorvald charged up and ran, smashing into the doors at full speed. A mighty roar was pulled from the iron as it bent. Another smash and our party began to hear footsteps. On the third try, Thorvald smashed through the doors, taking them off of their hinges, flailing the door open.\n\nInside there were many soldiers, identified as such my their blue armor. Jarvand hid and shot arrows while Thorvald went on a gruesome rampage, killing three from the flying doors themselves.\n\nThey fight through the fortress, alarms sounding and groups coming to kill them at every turn.\n\nOn one group ((The third if anyone cares)) Jarvand saw a man. Not any man, but a man who threw fire itself. He seemed to bend the world to his will.\n\nThis was true power.\n\nJarvand yelled at Thorvald to keep the man alive, and after the battle ended the man, a mess of bones and flesh, was technically alive.\n\n\"Get away from me you monsters!\" He spat along with his blood, \"You will have nothing from me!\"\n\nJarvand asked, \"What was that back there. You threw fire. You made monsters appear.\"\n\n\"It's magic, but I doubt a barbarian like you would understand.\"\n\nMagic... \"What is magic?\"\n\n\"Magic is something only Gods can grant you evil bastard! You will never get to him!\" At that, despite several broken bones, he lunged towards Jarvand, intent on ripping his throat out.\n\nPurely on instinct, Thorvald grabbed and crushed the mans head. ((Note: the GM did this forcibly, using the lack of Intelligence as an excuse. We had played with him before and knew that he forced actions if someone is neglecting a skill, such as gas in the air for Constitution, that Indiana Jones run from boulder thing for Endurance and iron doors for Strength. He keeps this in check by refusing to know our stats but making us roll instead.))\n\nThey continued on, despite the danger and dwindling health, fighting two more groups before arriving at the antechamber. They opened the unlocked doors and arrived at an old man, dressed in a blue and purple robe, holding a chicken.\n\n\"Chicken!\" Screamed Thorvald.\n\n\"Yes, this is The Chicken,\" replied the old man, \"The Chicken Korn. He is our God.\"\n\n\"Your god?\" Jarvand asked, \"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"Indeed. This chicken is one of great power. We know not of his origin, but we know of his importance. Behold.\"\n\nThe room filled with light and in the center of the room glowed six items. A sword, a shield, a staff, robes and two rings. The old man demanded that the duo take the items.\n\n\"My entire order was just killed by you two. The prophecies predicted this. You will be the champions of Korn. So it was told, so it shall be.\"\n\n((Please, if you have any questions leave them in the comments. I had to get the notes from our DM for the dialogue. Will Thorvald and Jarvand accept the Chicken? If they do, what next? Next time, on Dragonball Z!))",

I thought it might be a good idea to introduce it as a regular feature - We'll do it once a week, and keep it Tuesday for the sole reason that I can make a catchy name out of it.\n\nSo what will happen is every Tuesday LAPTOPSCHOOL, or a mod, will post a topic which hopefully will awaken long forgotten/repressed memories of game sessions gone by. I'll put a link in the sidebar to what will become the list of Topics, and if the feature takes off and remains as popular as the first post did, it'll hopefully create an impressive archive of great stories.\n\n(If however that post was a total fluke and no one participates in future posts, I'll quietly delete the sidebar link, creep away in another direction, and we can pretend this never happened.)\n\nBy the way - I have set up a Google Doc for potential future Tuesday's Tale Topic subjects. I don't want to make it public right now, but if a few of you would like access, drop me a PM with three of your topic ideas, and I'll send you the link. If too many of you ask, sorry in advance, but I may have to turn some of you away.",

        "text": "*This story is a mostly faithful retelling of a Once Upon A Time game held with about 10 friends (all new players). I have added and left things out according to whether it matched the flow of the story. It is mainly here so that I can whip out a 'fairy-tale' or some such for other games/novels/whatever else. Feel free to adapt this story for your own game or novel.*\n\n*For future reference, 10 people is an extremely large group for this game, especially for mostly new players to co-operative games. I would suggest that large groups be played by people who would actively share 'game' time; as it was, some players did not get much time to add to the story before others jumped in to steal the limelight.*\n\n*I posted this and my other game-related stories at [http://zeitoune-dnd.blogspot.com.au/](http://zeitoune-dnd.blogspot.com.au/)*\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a village with a large magical tree that reached up into the sky. The tree was being cared for by the local witch, who continually used her magic to make the tree as gigantic as it was. She was beloved by almost everyone in the village; everyone, that is, except for a grumpy and cantankerous old villager named Joe.\n\nThe villagers dismissed Joe's raving claims and wild-eyed rants, thinking that Joe was just jealous that the witch did not age like the rest of the villagers. Little did they know that a long, long time ago Joe fell in love with the witch and secretly they had a child who they named Toby. Joe loved the Witch and his son with all of his heart, but his heart was forever broken when the Witch betrayed them both.\n\nThe Witch had discovered ancient earth magic that bound a human being with a piece of nature. This magic gave the caster almost eternal life. However, the catch was that the caster was forbidden to love any mortal for as long as the spell was in effect. Tempted by the gift of eternal life, the Witch gave up her son to a giant named Kony and completely shut Joe out of her life.\n\nJoe grew old and bitter, and constantly plotted devious schemes to poison the tree. After decades of watching the villagers throw festivals and honors for the Witch and the Tree, the old man decided to put one of his plans into action. The Witch was tipped off about the plan, and confronted Joe in a clearing in the forest just outside the village.\n\nA fight broke out, and the calamity drew other villagers into the clearing. They were shocked to find the Witch battered and bruised, and her wounds left her in a dire state. The villagers quickly turned on Joe and locked him in an animal cage, while they hurried the witch into the healer's hut.\n\nToby, however, was laboring under the harsh rule of Kony with the other children that Kony had stolen from the local villages. Kony called his tribe of stolen children the Ug'Andans, which in giant meant 'child soldiers'. But one cold, quiet night Toby managed to escape into a river and followed it until he came upon a clearing near a village.\n\nToby, wet and tired from his ordeal, climbed his way out of the river and headed to the local healer's hut. While his wounds were tended to, Toby met a wondrous lady who was blinded by a recent battle. During the conversation, the Witch started to tell the story of how she gave up her only son to a giant named Kony in return for eternal life. She wept as she described her child, and Toby quickly realised that the woman was describing him!\n\nIn anger, Toby ran out of the healer's hut but not before the Witch was able to tell Toby of where he could find his father. Distraught but also elated that he finally found out who his parents were, Toby went out in search for his father. He found Joe in a cage on the outskirts of the village, now frail and thin from the poor treatment given to him by the other villagers.\n\nJoe wailed as Toby approached the cage, instantly recognizing his long lost son. They embraced as well as they could with the metal bars in the way, and they chatted for a long while about their lives and the Witch. It was then that Joe told of a rumor about a long lost book that could break the spell. The problem was that the book was in a long-forgotten empire in the east where the desert stretched out further than the eye could see.\n\nEmboldened and determined to get his mother back, Toby grabbed some supplies and a sword and set out in search of the empire. It was largely uneventful, but he eventually broke through a swamp and saw a desert that stretched as far as his eyes could see. Unfortunately, he could also see the ruins of what would have been a magnificent empire.\n\nIt was then that a magical talking horse approached Toby and began to strike a conversation. Toby told the horse about his quest, and the horse neighed joyously and claimed that he knew where the book could be found. So Toby jumped onto the horses back and was whisked away to one of the ruins. There was no noticeable entrance, so Toby had to climb up to the nearest window to enter the ruin.\n\nIt was then that Toby heard low groans and growls. The ruin was infested with Zombies! Undeterred, Toby unsheathed his sword and began to lay waste to the zombies. As he went from room to room slaying zombies Toby searched for the book, but unfortunately could not find anything. Toby left the ruins to tell the horse off for misleading him, when in the distance they saw a Giant and large force of child soldiers approaching them. It was Kony and the Ug'Andans! They had come to bring Toby back!\n\nToby jumped onto the back of the talking horse and managed to outrun the chasing army into a nearby forest. It was there that Toby confronted the horse about the deception, and the horse just laughed and said that he knew where the book was actually located but that Toby had to beat the horse in a running race.\n\nToby, realising that he could never beat the horse, instead decided to break the horse's legs. However, this left the horse gravely wounded and dying. The horse beckoned Toby to lean closer, and with it's dying breath the horse said:\n\n\"The curse on your mother can never be lifted....\"\n\nDistraught, Toby knelt on the ground and let out a loud, anguished cry that could be heard for miles.",

        "text": "So I'm working on a microlite 20 derived game called Star Squad 20 about Hollywood alien thriller style gung ho space marines. This is my incredibly broken first testing session.\n\nSquad Name: 1st Recon\n\nInactive squad members\n\nCorporal L. Prograve aka Squad Leader - Played by my 19 year old cousin Andrew\n\nPrivate Thistleberry, Melee Specialist -Played by my 16 year old cousin Bethany\n\nThe active squad members\n\nPrivate Screwball - played by my uncle Jonathan\n\nAssistant Squad Leader/GM - played by me\n\nPrivate Rose, the squad machine gunner - played by my 12 year old cousin Kristina\n\nFumbles (because I forgot the name) our sniper - played by my 16 year-old cousin Sascha\n\nAfter a rather taxing flight to the surface of a backwater planet, my \"squad\" had dismounted our dropship, during which Fumbles faceplanted spectacularly, and hoofed it to our objective. Upon reaching the objective, a small relay station, Private Screwball the Tech notices that the auto sentries are down and steps to a diagnostic port with his repair computer to investigate while Rose, Fumbles, and I watch his back. After a series of hacks and counter hacks, he reports possible hostiles to me and I radio Command for advisement. I receive a rather sketchy and noncommittal description of intelligent robots known as Krylons being the most possible source of our problems and an order to engage. So I order Rose to kick in the relay station door and check her corners. One Mighty strength check later, the squad (minus Fumbles who was guarding the perimeter) was in the main room of the station with a Krylon Commander trying to machine gun them. we all missed the Krylon during the surprise round, and he missed Rose, winged Screwball, and bodyshot me for a third of my HP in one attack. Screwball, seeing that he might have a melee advantage, charged in and attacked with his Marine Corps Close Combat Sword promptly missing. The Krylon countered with the 1d6+2 fist of doom and also missed, so I charged in with my Headhunter Machete and scratched the Krylon for half of his HP. Rose, who I forgot to issue a cease firing order to, decides to fire into the melee killing the Krylon and hitting me for another third of my HP. I then call Command for reinforcements and get a “help is on the way” response. After Screwball failed to turn the Krylon commander’s body into an assault drone I called for a tactical advance to the rear and the entire squad shouted our motto on cue “Sounds fine to me!”. During our leap frog retreat the three other Krylons who didn’t attack us immediately came running out of the relay station and opened fire which put the radioman/ASL/me unconscious and unstable. Fumbles, Screwball, and Rose quickly killed the pursuit and dragged me back to the evac point for medical attention. After the medics rolled a crit fail injuring me even worse, they finally stabilized me and patched me up. I got a purple heart and Screwball got a purple heart. I’m hoping to have a longer misadventure with the amazing 1st Recon again sometime and post it here too.",

        "text": "So as I mentioned in my previous tale, Baha Abdur's player went to America, which meant he missed pretty much everything from [Session 8](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gkc3k/keeping_calm_and_killing_khaasta_dd_35e_e6/) until Now.  \n  \n[Here is an Index of everything so far.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2j4ui8/your_campaign_tales_wanted/cl8gzfp)  \n  \nSaving Asimov from Hades  \n[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2csbp6/my_dd_35e_e6_planescape_game_xpost_rdnd/)  \n[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2djjc1/beholders_basilisk_blood_and_bumbling_heroes_dd/)  \n[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ewtct/wizards_walking_dwellings_wood_woads_and_women_dd/)  \n[Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gkc3k/keeping_calm_and_killing_khaasta_dd_35e_e6/)  \n[Part 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2iujxk/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_five_dd_35e_e6/)  \n[Part 6](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2iv37q/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_six_dd_35e_e6/)  \n  \n**The Party for this Bonus Session**  \n*I wrote up characters, let them pick at random, then let them name them...except for Hunter, he's an regular NPC, had four written, only two used*  \n**Hunter D. Huntington** - Gnome Huntsman Extrodinaire, with a Splitting, Exit Wounding Crossbow he is an instrument of death. Played by Fortinbras.  \n**Winstaaan** - Air Goblin Sorcerer Supreme, Associate of Hunter's, and their guide to the third layer of the 9 hells. Played by Kurask.   \n**Cheeron** - Centaur Fighter - Bowman and Tracker, a solid front linesman also. Played by Norril.  \n**Baha Adbur** separated from the Party, Baha gets a call from Hunter, Hunter would like a favour...  \n  \nSo our session starts in Sigil, where Hunter summons Baha Abdur to the guild, he tells him there's no time to waste, introduces him to Cheeron and tells him he's had a message from Amathalda, ([Session 13](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2iv37q/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_six_dd_35e_e6/)) who needs help in the nine hells of Baator. Baha is game to help the guild and Cheeron too, they head to the gate-town of Ribcage and meet Winstaaan, who guides them to a portal on the Third layer of the 9 hells; Minauros.  \nThey come out into a cave in Minauros, a putrid, fetid, stinking cave system, the fungi glows and illuminates the pollution.I describe the layer as a bog of vile pollution, decaying bodies, and rotting marsh. As they see the exit to the cave it's near an Acid waterfall, and several Slimey Kobolds (Half Ooze), a quick fight ensues, with Hunter counting each kill and the rest struggling to keep up, which was some fun roleplay. The kobolds spat acid and the floor occasionally gave way to acid geysers, which the party learned to avoid.  \nAs they exited the cave I tell them they can take in the putrid landscape on a large scale now, to the horizon it's soggy, bone-strewn, disease-ridden swampland, with muck running down the \"ceiling\" of stalactites and falling like clumpy rain over the place. I explain that up there is the second layer of hell, and it's fetid waste pours over Minauros.  \nThey soon found the scene of Amalthalda's battle, as the Half Orc paladin lay atop a demon, she'd crushed it's skull with her helmet, until nothing but pulp remained, her axe shattered she collected a sword from one of her dead paladin brothers. Amalthalda worships Pelor and there was a half dozen other Paladins of Pelor scattered amidst twenty or so formidable looking demons. I explained to the party for Demons, dying in the material isn't a big deal, they come back here. Dying here is dying for good. Baha Abdur has a tattoo of Pelor's holy symbol on his forehead, so Amalthalda likes him already.    \nAmalthalda explains they are trying to stop a blacksmith from mining Darksteel in Minauros and using it to equip cultists in the material. She does not know their purpose, but she knows it cannot be good. They were unlucky and encountered these demons, that's when she called for aid from Hunter, a good friend who owed her a favour. The party make for the mines, not wanting to risk being in the open for too long.  \nThe party make it to a large set of metal doors guarded by two large blackguards, stealth is attempted and failed. The guards are strong, half giant blackguards with sorcerer levels. They take a chunk of life out of the party... Hunter slays both... on one he rolled 5 misses and a crit, it was hilarious,describing these bolts fly past this huge knight and plop into the dirt and then thwok, one in the viser slit and he is no more.  \n  \nHunter did the heavy lifting here, he was by far the most powerful, closely followed by Baha Abdur, they're supposed to respect his prowess as Sigil's greatest hunter but he didn't outshine them too much, they all still contributed to the fights very well.  \n  \nThe party then ride minecarts (four separate, yet attached like train carriages) down into the depths, passing a gorge with a Balor that caused fear on them but was too far to attack them. Then speeding up into a room with crystals that *as they were going so fast* managed to cut them a little as they went by, too quick to dodge (ref for half), then sped up even more to dangerous speeds... brakes were pulled, which snapped under the pressure of the speed they were going (% chance, higher if at speed), they were travelling so fast that the rumbling dislodged stalactites, Winstaaan took one right in the face because he wasn't paying attention, he was too busy whooping and cheering to dodge, the rest were struck by rubble but escaped the worst of it. Baha Abdur threw up from the sheer speed of it all. They flew past a poison gas chamber but were going to fast to even notice. Then on a sharp corner the air goblin got thrown clear out of the cart, and Hunter failed to grab him as he was thrown out. Winstaaan loved it, cast fly on himself (he had it readied) and then expeditious retreated to catch up with the cart.  \nThe cart then hit a dead end, throwing the passengers clear against a wall... except the floating air goblin who landed and took note of the surroundings.  \nCrushed minecarts... a passage leading down into a mine one way and large metal doors the other, they realised that this was the forge and braced for entry.  \n  \nAmalthalda blessed their weapons and they moved in, There were Lemures shoveling Darksteel ore into furnaces to smelt it down to a workable material, and an Erinyes overseeing the operation. Chained to the table was a Duerger smith.  \n  \nThe Erinyes summoned in three bearded devils and the fight went chaotic quick. Hunter and Cheeron took on the Lemures in the first two rounds, Baha Abdur took on the three Barbed Devils on his own, and Winstaaan got into a spellcast battle with the Erinyes. Amalthalda used prayers, buff spells and lay on hands to great effect.  \nTwo of the Bearded devils went down in the third round, hunter's crossbow jammed and Winstaaan fled the room on low health. Baha Abdur had several infernal wounds from bearded devils glaives and was bleeding heavily, he dropped the last devil in the fourth round and focused on the Erinyes.  \nthe Erinyes was in the air above them, having a flying magic duel with the sorcerer and dropped down between the Paladin and Baha Abdur, it was on about half health and was suffering ongoing damage from Winstaaan's Manyjaws... which he cast with cries of \"gnasher! nipper! chomper! lets go!\" like a goblin santa claus.  \n  \nThe drop-charge knocked Baha Abdur down to 3hp, and the Paladin low also. On Baha's turn his wounds dropped him to 1hp and he swung hard, driving the devil back (onto 1hp also), Hunter fired wildly and missed everything, cursing. Then the Devil turned on Baha...and was promptly eaten by manyjaw's ongoing damage and had it's head lopped off from a smite from the Paladin as it fell.  \nThey quickly healed the worst of their wounds and got about liberating the Darksteel.  \n  \nAmalthalda and Baha Abdur turned to the Duerger smith. The smith introduces himself: *\"Thangardt Hammerhand was my name when I had one. Devils took my name. Took my clan. Took my family. Took my eyes and my tongue, took my fingers one by one...made me whole again after made me work, broke me when I stopped, made me again to make me work.\"* Baha releases him and loans him a Scimitar, he cuts off his hair, beard, cuts the Erinyes and uses the blood as warpaint, inscribing his body with tattoos. He also plunges his hands into the hot liquid Darksteel, muttering that his foes will never force him to forge in their name again. Hunter tears up a little, as a gnome he speaks Dwarvish and recognises the slayer rights, even if it is from a Duerger. He explains this to Baha later, that the Dwarf will know nothing but pain and death for the rest of his days as a Devilslayer. He even points out that the dwarf won't be able to eat anything with his hands encased in darksteel...unless he kills it with his teeth.  \nAmalthalda teleports them back to her temple, in Elysium, they are healed, Baha Abdur prays to Pelor and they return to Sigil, Baha gets a share of Darksteel and Hunter hands him a gem, like the one Amalthalda had, Hunter tells him he can call in this favour if he should need to.  \nThen Baha Abdur heads back to the party's shop. The party bump into Amalthalda in Sigil when she returns and sell her a Gold Frystalline Morningstar, a very appropriate weapon for a Paladin of Pelor, and it replaces the one she lost in Baator.  \n  \nThe party is whole again, and readies to face Hades.  \n  \n[Next Session](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2lh7fh/game_tale_saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_seven_35e/)",

        "text": "A Red Campaign story,\n\nThe first thing you should know is what sort of team we were. There was me, the war domain cleric who was the slightly reckless team leader. With me was our wizard, Cennek, he was a little bit smarter than the rest of us and tries in vain to keep the team on track. Lastly, there is our barbarian, Gruncle, a brutish character who ended up, more often than not, following my questionable lead. Our DM was /u/SnakeSender , if it concerns anyone.\n\n\nWe were tasked with finding an artifact in a cave, although we never asked what the artifact was, and therefore didn't know what we were looking for. We camped outside the cave, and in the morning, before Gruncle woke up, I decided we were low on rations and invited Cennek to go hunting. It took a lot of convincing, but he agreed to join me so long as he didn't have to use spell slots. He had forgotten that cantrips existed so he insisted that I loan him my light hammer. When we were about to set out  Gruncle woke up and enthusiastically joined the hunt.\n\n We spent a few hours searching for an animal and found a rabbit hole. Gruncle punched the hole for a while, trying to kill a rabbit, while I used thaumaturgy to make pig noises, hoping to find bigger prey. Eventually, the barbarian caught a rabbit which I decapitated with my axe. Cennek started cleaning the meat up while I tried to use the blood as bait. Eventually, Gruncle felt something slither by his legs(at this point, the DM realized we wouldn't do anything until we fought something). He decided that the logical thing to do is to stomp on the snake, which proceeded to bite him, immediately incapacitating our barbarian.The snake began to coil around him and I rushed it with my bedroll, which I threw over its head, yelling \"conk it on the head, wizard! conk it on the head! you have the hammer.\" Cennek then approaches the fight and tries to hit the snake with my hammer, missing.\n The next few rounds followed this formula:\n\nGruncle makes a death save,\n\nthe snake slips out of the bedroll and tries to bite me, missing(he lost a tooth on my armor once),\n\nI put the bedroll back over its head,\n\nCennek misses it with the hammer.\n\nAfter a few rounds of that, I decided we weren't winning, so I healed Gruncle, who soon broke free of the snake's coil. The snake is pushed to the side without Cennek's player noticing, so when he attacks and finally rolls a hitting number and celebrates. The DM tells him that the snake is out of range, but I argue he can throw the hammer. The wizard finally hits, dealing a whopping 1 damage (and losing my hammer). The snake starts to run, provoking an opportunity attack from me (which missed). I run after it and cast guiding bolt, which kills it. The DM put this perfectly, he said \"the snake stops moving, and doesn't start again\". It turns out that, that snake was a fourth of the appropriate challenge rating for our team(in other words, it was about a fourth as difficult as one of our encounters should be). We ate the snake.\n\n/u/SnakeSender and myself will post the most exciting of the adventures in this campaign here. We're calling it The Red Campaign because why not.",

        "text": "So, in my last session, my group decided they wanted an Ambush Drake over me. It started off as a normal session, with us all travelling on a caravan like you usually do, when we saw the town of green-nest in flames. Being the ever heroic idiot, I decided to pair up with our group wizard, and ride into the city, with our sorcerer and cleric in tow. We arrived to the village to see that the town wasn’t in any particular danger, but we did notice that the only point were the fires had seemingly not reached was the fort in the middle of town. Our party wizard decided to split off, and sneak into the reeds. I decided to cast light onto my blade to make it glow, but quickly dismissed it, realising that there may be some hostiles in the city. But, as if to make up for me turning my light off, the party cleric thought it would be a good idea to start banging pans and pots right behind me. This obviously alerted some guys, who we promptly dispatched with a couple of quick stabs to the face, and our sorcerer yelling out ‘THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK’ before casting fire bolt. We managed to capture one of the men who attacked us, who promptly decided to die before we could get any information.\n\n\nWe took our losses, and continued forward, being ambushed again by a large number of kobolds, and two Ambush Drakes. This is where the fight took an interesting turn, I charge into combat, being the bloody fool I am, and get promptly knocked out, having had something like 5 kobolds, and a Drake trying to eat my face off, as well as this, our group sorcerer decided to use burning hands, and kill the rest of the kobolds, and knock yours truly unconscious. I did kill one of the kobolds before dying though, although, that was the only thing I did in that combat.\n\n\nNow, I was waiting patiently for the others to finish off the kobolds whilst I sat around, bleeding out for a… decent amount of time. Now, at this point in time there was an Ambush Drake standing over me, not quite mauling me, but just standing there, so, the Cleric, not wanting to kill the Drake, goes ahead and stabilizes me, on top of drawing a big, black dick on my face. As well as this, our group sorcerer decided that he wanted to tame the drake. So, being the ever charming sorcerer that he is, he started speaking to it in draconic, saying simple command words that the Cult of the Dragon typically use for their Drakes. The drake was quite responsive to this, and decided to stop trying to kill me, and pay attention to the Sorcerer. At this point, the sorcerer brought out a piece of meat, and fed it to the drake, nearly getting his hand torn off, our DM told him to roll for an animal handling check, and wouldn’t you guess, he rolled a Natural, fucking, twenty, and basically, the Drake became his pet. With stats and everything.\n\n\nAnd so concludes how my party chose an Ambush Drake over me. IN that session, I managed to also get myself knocked out in a 1v1 against a giant half dragon, and take down a blue dragon by throwing my sword at it and summoning it back to my hand. Our Wizard also successfully managed to get himself killed, and turn into a Gold Dragon, killing the blue dragon I clipped the wing of. All in all, it was a fun session, and I look forward to further ones.",

        "author": "mechroid",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2j6hl3/a_cursed_items_tale_the_price_of_friendship/",
        "text": "I once ran a game with some of the most fantastic roleplayers I have ever met, the most memorable moment involving a cursed item became something of a legend among our group, always retold, always embellished:\n\nThe item was a \"ring of greed\".  It was intended to be a ring of spiderclimb, but the jewelsmith was trying to cheat his client out of their money by giving them a fake. When his customer, a powerful lich, found out about this transgression, he slayed the man right then and there with a power word: Kill.  The dark energies twisted from his heart to rest inside the ring, turning it into a cursed item.    \nThe curse was that the player could never let go of anything.  They couldn't pay for items, they couldn't give someone else their health pots... It was fairly easy to work around, but it was a bit of a pain to do so.  And the only way to get rid of it was to make a trade with someone else who knew the ring was cursed. (that's how they got it)  And each time, to satisfy its greed, you have to sell it for more than you bought it for.  And holy crap, did they pay out the nose for this \"priceless magic artifact\" somebody in the city sold them.\n\nOf course, my players immediately started abusing it, despite the protests of our dwarven paladin.  Dunmar would always warn them, \"You play with forces you could not possibly understand!\"    \nThe main warrior, Mattheis, was the first to get it.  He specialized in grapples and disarms.  Suddenly, when he grabbed an enemy's weapon, they couldn't use it.  He could literally take swords from enemies' hands whilst only taking a few HP worth of damage.  And even if cut all the way through, we ruled that his body couldn't be dismembered.    \nOur wizard, Rengar, who had a huge penalty to climb, (It's a long story involving the fact that he always wears gloves.) would use it to grip a cliff surface safely. The players would just pay more and more of their funds to let it trade hands, I mean, it's not like they were losing money since it was shared anyways.    \nEven our elven rogue, Earlwin, used it a few times to fleece people with dumb bar tricks. I was begrudgingly impressed by the player's manipulation of this ostensibly cursed item, but its final use left me stunned:\n\n---\n\nIn a fight on pillars of rock precariously balanced over lava, one of our players repeatedly lost his dexterity check and tumbled off the edge.  But at the last second, he manages to grab on to the fingertips of his childhood friend, our paladin!  Which was crazy lucky for a weak ass elven wizard.  But he started failing the strength checks and was unable to climb back on.  \n\nSo the paladin yells to the warrior \"I'LL TRADE YOU FOR YOUR RING!\"  But the trades have to be done by hand, and both of them are otherwise... occupied.  Warrior pinning the enemy down, paladin holding our wizard.\n\nSo the last player in the party, Earlwin the rogue, speaks up.  \"HOLD ON I HAVE AN IDEA!\"  (I'm typing in all caps because the players were literally screaming in fear right now...) He uses his action to sprint to the warrior: \"I'll trade you my...  *Crap, DM, how much did we last sell it for?*\"  Me: \"6,00G.\" \"*...We don't even have that much between us anymore!  Shit, shit, SHIT*\"  Our rogue searches his pockets, finds nothing.  Finally, he pulls an ornate ring off his finger and gives it to the warrior.  \"Mattheis, I am a prince of an ancient line.  I trade you my heritage for your ring of greed.\"    \nMe: This may affect your history, your backstory, and who your character is at a fundamental level, do you accept whatever consequences ensue?    \n\"Yes.  I give it willingly.\"\n\nMattheis, speechless, accepts the ring.  At this point, I'm completely winging it.  *Damn, is the ring powerful enough to do that?  Whatever.  It's now an ancient artifact, I'll figure this out its history later.*  \"With a crack of magic, Earlwin recieves the ring.  Mattheis, your memories twist.   You feel as if the fabric of history has been rewitten.  You remember you were found abandoned in the woods by the royal family, and since they were unable to have a son, they considered you a sign from god.  You are now heir to the Elven throne, and only the recipient of the ring remembers any differently.\"   \nThe entire table went silent as the group processed this.  The paladin sat there, thinking about what debt he would have to pay for the ring that would save his friend.  Earlwin solemnly walks over to Dunmar, the paladin.  Even the devils they were fighting stopped to see how this machiavellian price would be paid.  \"Go on, worm. Receiving that ring will now cost more than we could ever take from you.  Pay the price, and we'll let you go.  Refuse, or try to trick us, and we will ensure that your 'friend' dies.\"\n\nDunmar looks at Rengar, his childhood friend, and then back at Earlwin.  \"What must I pay for this, rogue?\"\n\nEarlwin tells him the price he must beat.\n\nThe paladin goes silent for a long while before putting his words together with the utmost care: \"In order to have that ring, in order to save my friend...  I, Dunmar, would pay anything.  But the only price worthy of your throne... is my faith.  This I bequeath upon you.\"  As the rings changed hands, there was yet another flash, another tear in reality... And the runes on his armor fade.  They strip from the iron like vinyl stickers, float through the air, and come to rest on Earlwin's hooded cloak.    \nI inform the party: \"Earlwin, you now have the favor of a god.  The divine power of Armok, who rules over the dwarves and the denizens of the underdark, has influenced your life for years.  You do not know why he has chosen a hero outside his realm, but you hope to uphold his mantle by stealing from the rich under the cover of darkness, and fighting for the rights of people you don't even share a heritage with. (He was pretty much robin hood already anyways.)\"    \n\"Dunmar: You are now a mercenary, a worshiper of gold instead of god, a follower of profits instead of prophets.  Later we can decide whether you're a warrior or beserker, but you do know that the gods have never acknowledged your presence, and seem to actively antagonize you.  Only you know that they despise you for selling their favor like a mere commodity.\"\n\n\"It was a price worth paying.  I assist Rengar as he starts to climb up the obsidian pilliar, warily watching to see if the devils honor their agreement.\"\n\n\"As lawful creatures, they uphold their end of the bargain, but you can tell they're not too happy about it.  Okay Rengar, roll your last climb check.\"  Rengar throws the dice... And luck was not with him.\n\n\"A... A one. I rolled a one.\"\n\n---\n\nI frown and speak softly.  \"Though Dunmar cannot drop you, the sweat, heat, and chaos of battle have loosened your gloves on your hands.  Your fingers slip from it, one by one, and... *roll* your other hand fails to find purchase on the smooth obsidian surface.\"\n\n\"NO, NOT AFTER ALL WE'VE DONE!\" the entire table cries.  Rengar speaks up quickly \"I have one last plan.  Dunmar, put the ring on my gloved hand and prepare to make a trade!\"\n\n\"But what could you possibly pay!  I just gave up the power of a god!\"\n\nRengar looks up.  \"Something I personally valued more than a kingdom, more than divinity.  The thing I valued most was... The bonds of friendship between us.\"\n\nEverybody's stunned, I'm on the verge of crying.  I hold back the tears and inform him of his fate: \"The ring glows a bright white, you feel the fabric of history twist once more, and the price has been paid. But the ring continues to glow brighter and brighter... Whatever dark energy that powered its curse seemed to be spent changing history for a third time.  Perhaps it was the final selfless act that did it in.  We may never know.\"  I continue on.  \"As the darkness escapes, so does the light.  It envelops you.  The magic of this powerful artifact rests inside you.  Mark your sheet, you now have Spiderclimb as a special ability.  You can easily clamber up the side of the pillar without even having to roll.\"\n\n\"History has changed.  Dunmar, you and Rengar have never met.  In fact, you don't know why, but you actively mistrust him, -8 penalty to all of your interactions from this point on.  He's just a dirty wizard to you, hiding behind his spellbook.\"\n\n---\n\nThe devils, in the end, held up their side of the bargain.  Nobody attacked the party as they made their way deeper down.  But Rengar was never able to convince any of them that he and Dunmaer were once friends.",

I could go into why it took me so darn long, but there would be no way for you to know if I were lying or not, and it would just distract from the *tale* dude...\n\nAnyway.\n\nPlayer was on the pointy end of a brilliant energy spear (Ha ha! Star Wars themes!) and being forbidden from entering a forest. The forest itself wasn't necessarily forbidden, but the elves just didn't want him moving in and lowering the property value.\n\nAtonalxotl wasn't necessarily interested in hearing Player's proposition, but she also wasn't too keen on leaving his stinking corpse right on what was essentially her doorstep, so she allowed him to speak.\n\nPayer, for his part, was fairly into fantasy and sci fi IRL, so he had a bit of knowledge on how to negotiate diplomatically in a fictitious setting. He lays out his plans for the future - unite army (inspired by pretty much every BioWare game we'd played), conquer enemies, profit - and makes a few promises to the elves in exchange for passage, if not actual assistance.\n\nFirst, he would not harm any of the trees or elves within the forest. Second, he would conduct his business as quickly as possible, and then leave. Third, he would agree to be watched at all times, so long as he remained within the forest.\n\nFinally - if he **ever** violated any of the previous terms! he would be summarily tracked down and destroyed. He didn't suggest that one, but he wasn't exactly in a position to decline. If he wanted into the forest, he would have to agree to the terms.\n\nSo he did. Atonalxotl's mood quickly brightened, and she helped him to his feet, before slipping back into the trees. Her final words of warning, before Player lost track of her, were \"Don't stray from the path!\"\n\nNow, whenever I give players instructions like that through an NPC - particularly high level ones like Atonalxotl - it's not because I want them to disregard them in order to acquire gp. Usually, it's because I have a mission planned for the area later on down the line, or because I subscribe to the \"pre-existing world\" school of thought. I've built this world *for* you to exist in, not *because* you exist. Simply put, there is some scary stuff in the world, and you're not necessarily ready for it.\n\nIn this case, it was a bit of both.\n\nPlayer goes for about a mile or so before hearing roars and crashes, coming from - you guessed it - off the path. So, as players are wont to do, Player strays from the path.\n\nNow, I did plan on him coming back to this. Maybe I was hoping for his thought process to be closer to \"Hm, maybe I'll ask about it at the village, gear up properly, and then come back to investigate on the way out.\"\n\nInstead, he creeps up on a clearing, where most of the trees have been uprooted or broken. He quickly identifies the source of the noise - a small clutch of green dragons are at play, wrestling and knocking a few trees over.\n\nI put them there as potential allies (also because I felt like the elves had had it easy for long enough in their forest). He could have approached with a bit more caution or finesse, possibly offering them something in exchange for an audience, and then enticed them into his short list of not-quite-enemies with promises of more territory and a bunch of loot.\n\nInstead, he picks one out (there are three, only two of which are wrestling together at this time), applies some poison to his weapons, and then fires a crossbow at it.\n\nUnderstandably, it's curious as to what's happening, so it turns around, sees him almost immediately, and decides that Player must want to play.\n\nPlayer *thinks* he does but, a few rounds later, determines that he does not, in fact, want to play.\n\nThe dragon is really trying to swallow him, but it just isn't big enough. It doesn't help that Player keeps sticking short swords into the roof of its mouth. Eventually, it settles for belching acid over him, after a good swing manages to cut out one of its eyes, and scurries off.\n\nPlayer, now acid washed and grungy, is slightly panicked now. He's down by quite a few hit points, and the acid is still eating away at them.\n\nI, in my mercy, tell him that he hears a woman's laughter, followed quickly by the sight of Atonalxotl approaching again. She gives him a brief reprimand on what sort of tyrant he expects to be if he can't hold his ground against a single dragon, when his enemies would likely be sending armies.\n\nPlayer promises to take it under advisement, then asks if she has anything to help with the acid that is currently eating away at him. She takes some pity, hands him something for the acid, then something for the pain (potion of cure moderate wounds), and asks if he needs to be escorted to his destination.\n\nTired of things trying to eat him, Player accepts.\n\nAfter another few miles, Player is delivered to his destination, and introduced to the town elder, who delivers him to his victim's next of kin.\n\nPlayer: \"I bring the remains of your son, so that you may perform what rites you see fit.\"\n\nVictim's Father: \"How did he die?\"\n\nPlayer: \"I killed him.\"\n\nVictim's Mother: \"What? Why!?\"\n\nPlayer: \"I wanted what he had, so I killed him. While he slept.\"\n\nVictim's Father: \"So, have you come here to rub it in? Are you proud of having killed our son as he slept?\"\n\nPlayer: \"No. I was forced to come and deliver this news, as well as his remains, by the paladins that rule my city. I am under a magical compulsion, and I am to await your judgement for killing your son.\"\n\nAfter a few moments, the next of kin look at either Player or one another, before turning and taking their deceased away.\n\nPlayer finds himself shunned by nearly everyone, save the village elder who clarifies that judgement had not yet been technically passed (another bit of insurance in addition to the agreement from earlier), but that he was free to go until they reached a decision on what to do with him.\n\nPlayer: \"Well, elf girl, I guess this is goodbye.\"\n\nAtonalxotl, grinning slightly: \"Oh? You know your way back from here, then?\"\n\nPlayer, sensing an opportunity for a partner: \"Riiight... About that...\"\n\n~To Be Continued.~\n\n[Finale Here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2q3i8s/dd_35_did_i_mention_that_i_dont_like_dming_evil/)",

        "text": "Hi there, /u/BounceBastard here. You may know me from a previous couple tales about such things as a [party member almost getting killed first level by a measley snake](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2dht9x/pathfinder_how_our_first_real_fight_showed_us_how/), or perhaps a [reanimated dwarven skeleton ripping the eye out of a warg](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hb3u9/pathfinder_that_moment_when_a_newer_group_finally/) in our first time working together as a team.\n\nIf you aren't [one of the people](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dozens_of_us_arrested_development.gif) who read the previous posts before, that's okay! Here's a quick recap of the characters.\n\nStan the Rat is played by me. He's a ratfolk alchemist, so he's a 4 foot tall humanoid albino rat that makes magic drugs, more or less. Recently acquired clothes that made him better at sleight of hand checks, but we'll get to that later.\n\nNekhen is a tengu witch. As a tengu she's basically a humanoid crow gypsy thing. She's also a nudist and her witch abilities are centered more around necromancy. She has two reanimated dwarf skeletons that follow her around.\n\nGleep is a grippli gunslinger. 2 foot tall poison dart frog thing that still manages to shoot a gun somehow. She pretends she can't speak Common around us and only talks to Nekhen.\n\nZeravica is a dwarf fighter. She's our main offense and defense in battle, which is why she gets to wear the pelt of the warg we slayed as our first \"final boss\" as a cape.\n\nAnd Dindeep is a gnome summoner. In Pathfinder, summoners are connected to a certain creature from a different plane that is shaped by the summoner's mind. In this case, that creature is a six-limbed, giant white ferret.\n\nThis [motley crew](https://i.imgur.com/etAsR2P.jpg) of adventurers had, when we last saw them, brought the ingredients needed to cure a town of a plague slowly killing all of them. The town responded by letting them stay a while, which then became a bad idea. Stan started selling drugs, Zeravica drank most of the town's liquor... I could go on but basically, when left to their own devices this group is not easy to deal with. \n\nBefore I go on, here's some out of character stuff. The quest as described above that we had finished was a module we played to start while trying to find a GM, as ours bailed on us. At the end of that module, with close successes but nobody to join us in the end. Though I had never run a game before, I listened to a hell of a lot of podcasts and read many pieces of advice, so I took it up. We had a two week break due to real life, so I created a world and enough substance to make it feel real with the help of many random generators.\n\nAnyway, back to it. The group decides they like making money and doing cool stuff so they head over to the land's capital to hit up the adventuring guild, and they do, after getting a little grief from the city guards on the way in. We're having a good time so far. I get to introduce Grognak the Barber, a retired orc barbarian who serves as a mentor for the guild and gives them their options for introductory quests. They pick one and I get my information ready to start it up. \n\nUnfortunately, I made the mistake of telling them it takes four days to get where they need to go, but they have a week before they need to be there. Instead of leaving for the quest, they want to dick around about town first. Thankfully, what followed was fun. \n\nOur dwarf is also a locksmith. One of the major sectors of the city is dedicated to catfolk. These don't sound related, but in our world, the catfolk are pompous assholes, so the dwarf decides she wants to combine her abilities with those of Stan the Rat to play some pranks on the catfolk in the city. After some rolls, we find that she makes 30 locks of a basic design but very good quality throughout a decent portion of the day. Stan the Rat makes a potion of Disguise Self to make himself look like a catfolk and what followed was a series of disguise and sleight of hand checks to see if they could get away with this. A few rolls later, and there were 30 catfolk buildings with their residents trapped inside. At this point, the area's police force are looking for us, but somehow we barely manage to dodge them by hiding in a bush for a while. The \"Disablers of Doors\" are still at large.\n\nMeanwhile, our witch and gunslinger go to the bar to engage in drinking games. Off the top of my head I make up a rolling system to figure out the number of people in another party, then their race/class combos. So, they meet up with a party consisting of a half-orc fighter, a halfling druid, and two humans (a ranger and bard). Many drinking games later, which used an on-the-spot, shitty homebrewed system that proved quite fun, the Tengu managed to do some very heavy drinking, lead the entire tavern in song, and much to our surprise, get everyone there to like her. Very drunk, at the end of the night, she says she gets one of the people to take her home. I decide it's one of the party members, roll up for the orc, and then do what I never thought would work out so well. I got out my percentage die and rolled out for his attractiveness. \n\n99 percent. A fucking half orc with a 99 percent attractiveness rating.\n\nShe then rolls for diplomacy to see if he'll come up to the room with her. Doesn't go well, he sheepishly says no thanks. She then rolls for intimidate, grabs him by the collar, and says, \"You're coming with me now, got it? Get your fine ass upstairs.\" It works amazingly. \n\nAnd that's how our least charismatic party member ended up sleeping with a half-orc that looks like, as I let her decide, Channing Tatum. And now he's her boyfriend. \n\nI can't imagine what GMing a quest with these people will be like.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2j2puk/unmet_the_ballad_of_balthazar/",
        "text": "[Posted this elsewhere, X-posted here per request]\nAnyone familiar with a game called Unhallowed Metropolis? Post apocalyptic alternate history Steampunk Gothic Noir tabletop set in London Circa 2105 AD. Everything runs on Tesla Tech after zombies rose from their graves worldwide in 1905 and fucked up everything, People have managed to claw their way back into some cities and beat back the hordes like London and parts of the US east coast, Prussia and France. Then they found out that something has gone wrong with the world on a fundamental level as people start manifesting psychic powers (Similar to 40k Psykers except near total insanity is entry fee for powers) Ghosts and spirits start manifesting and haunting the ever loving shit out of everything, and farmable land is being overtaken by some strange blight that mutates all life within them that are inedible or have mutating qualities (and never the good, fun kind)\nANYWHO. Balthazar. And the ballad thereof.\nSo one of my players rolled up a Criminal (UnMet version of a rogue) This player is completely new to UnMet and didn't read over any of the lists after getting his stats and perks, we're 5 minutes from starting the game so he panics and spends all his starting cash on a fancy suit, Teashade sunglasses, a Baseball bat with nails in it, and 20 grenades. His backstory was that Balthazar was once the biggest crime kingpin in England until his number two, Nigel Biscuit, staged a coup and seized all his assets, killed most of his most powerful allies, and put a hit out on Balthazars head. Balthazar escapes by hiding in a crate full of Filthy Orphans which he convinces to serve him as his adopted children if they work for him (The children were taken off the street by an illegal child slavery operation being run by his last loyal henchman, they crated them up and sent them off to factories to be worked to death) The crate unfortunately falls off the back of the wagon taking it to the trainyard, it bursts open in a shady part of town. Rolled on random encounter table, he gets crazy hobo.\nSo a crazy hobo appears and runs at Balthazar scremaing \"DER GUBMIT STOLED MY TEEFS!\" Balthazar freaks out and yells \"Don't wowwy childwen, it's me! BALFAZAWR! I'll pwotect you!\". It was at this point that Balthzars player tried to do his best cockney accent but mangled it so horribly that Balthazar just sounded like he had a horrible speech impediment. His player refused to attempt to rectify the accent later stating \"It's too late, I'm already committed!\". Balthazar, or \"Balfazawr\" as he now calls himself, rolled attack with his Baseball bat against the hobo, fumbles the roll and then proceeds to fumble the hit roll and ends up accidentally smacking the child to his immediate left in the head, braining him instantly. He then rolls another attack, and WHIFFS BOTH THE ATTACK ROLLS AND BRAINS THE KID ON HIS RIGHT. We weren't five minutes into the game and Balfazawr has already accidentally murdered two of his allies. I could tell what we were in for after that, and I realized any sort of coherent plot was out of the question and switched to sandbox mode.\nBalthazar proceeds to hole up with the surviving children in an abandoned town house in north London and come up with a strategy to retake his position as the Crime King of London, get his revenge and rebuild his wealth. This i when he hooks up with the other players, an Undertaker (Freelance monster hunters/bounty hunters) homonculus, a Mourner (Assassin-type character trained to stay awake and stand perfectly, silently still for three days at a time and fight using oversized kukiris called \"Exculpus[es]\") and a scheming Nobleman looking to exploit property rights to take the crown employing the other two players, promising them answers for their past/riches if they act as his eyes, ear and hands in situations he cannot normally reach. He gets wind that the boss of one of his contacts, Balfazawr, is in need of help and works out a deal with him. Balfzawr makes no effort of hiding how little respect he has for Peerage by constantly referring to the Nobleman player as \"Lord Dipshit\", \"Duke Dickless\", etc. But he ultimately agrees to help him and his mercs pull off an incredibly dangerous heist: Raiding one of the biggest armories of the Deathwatch (Londons standing army and anti-zombie specialists)\nBalfazawr then recruits our last player, running as a German mad scientist by the name of Helga von Murderstein. Helga is a specialist in all things biological, with a particular gift for pharmaceuticals and creating homonculi. She views genetic material as a plaything. Balfazawr comes up with the bright idea to distract the Deathwatch by releasing a zombie horde into the Bermondsy district (South London) and raiding the armory while most of the personnel are away searching the area for offshoot infections. The problem is, he doesn't have a zombie horde, so he asks Helga \"Where do zombies come from?\". Helga states that any recently dead corpse has a chance to later rise between 30 seconds and 5 minutes of death to become a zombie. Balfazawr deduces that the best way to get a zombie army is to convert his half-burned out townhouse into an impromptu homeless shelter so he can lure homeless people in and murder them until one rises as a zombie, then capture the zombie and let it bite other homeless people until he has a horde.\nThis was the start of everything going allllll downhill forever in this game. Balfazawr figures that homeless people won't show up if he doesn't have food, so he takes the corpse of one of the children he brained accidentally and roasts it in the oven since \"humans supposedly taste like pork so they would smell like it too.\" He cajoles his remaining children into spreading the word out on the street that there's a new shelter that will feed the hungry in town. He gets 5 \"customers\" within an hour, and proceeds to beat them all to death with his baseball bat by having Helga barricade the door from the outside to prevent escape.\nHe ends up going through about 13 more hoboes until finally one raises from the dead, and then locks it in a cage out back.Unfortunately the rash of disappearances has started attracting beat cops to investigate the area, so Balfazawr decides the best thing to do is to pile all the corpses into a wagon and cart them over to the Noblemans property. This causes a huge uproar for obvious reasons. Helga gets the idea to petition the Nobleman for money to buy ingredients with which she would make a special serum that would take the corpses and forcibly turn them into zombies. This sounds like a good idea to everyone, so Helga spends the next few days mixing serum, when it's finally done cooking Helga asks Balthazar to bring her a dad body to test the serum. Balfzawr, instead of walking twenty feet to fetch one of the hobo corpses, see's the Noblemans pet cat sitting next to him and immediately proceeds to beat it to death and hands the blood remains to Helga. When questioned why he didn't just grab a hobo corpse, he stated \"I didn't feew wike wawking aw the way ovew thewe.\" He then goes around the Noblemans manor drinking all his brandy and smoking all his cigars and rifling through the pockets of all the coats in his closets looking for loose change after the Nobleman player got pissed about him killing his cat.\nFast forward a day and a half, the serum is a huge success, being able to zombify a corpse within 30 seconds of injection into the skull. A gangster the nobleman owes money to is putting pressure on him, making the Nobleman force everyone to enact the plan sooner than they were quite ready for. Helga and Balfazawr take the serum and the remaining corpses to Bermondsy. Unfortunately Balfazawr whiffs his navigation roll and gets Helga and himself lost. They wind up in some dank alleyway, no clue how to get to the designated drop point. Helga suggests calling the nobleman for directions but Balfazawr states \"No, that'd make me look like a fuggin idiot, we'ww just dump them hewe!\". Unfortunately, they were on the opposite side of town they were supposed to be in, they revive the corpses and radio home that the rest of the team can move in and set up next to the armory to be ready when the minor zombie outbreak get's the Deathwatch to mobilize and perform a sweep of the district. However, the place the revived the zombies was in the bad part of town where there aren't any deathwatch patrols, the zombies succeed on their attack rolls and proceed to eat and zombify the ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD within an hour, which then picks up steam and devours the next neighborhood. Within 24 hours, the entire Bermondsy district, population 2,350, has been half consumed by zombies creating a epidemic of a severity not seen in the last 20 years. The Deathwatch declare Code Black, quarantining the entire district and ordering everyone not wearing a uniform to be shot and immolated on sight, the Ball Lightning Cannons mounted on the walls surrounding the district start bombarding EVERYTHING in range, destroying entire swathes of housing and businesses.\nThe party is pissed as all hell at this point as they now are locked in with both the Deathwatch AND a zombie horde the likes of which they've never seen while Balfzawr calls an old contact from his human trafficking days and has him help Balfazawr hightail it out of Bermondsy on a horse cart before the gates on the district walls lock down. After cleaning out the armory, the other players radio Balfazawr:\nMercs: \"You asshole, you just left us? What about the loot?\nBalfazawr: \"I'd wather be poow and awive. This is aww youw fawlt if you fink about it.\"\nMercs: \"What if we give you 70%?\"\nBalfazwr: (Turns to the carriage driver) \"PETE! TUWN THIS FUCKEW AWOUND! MY FWIENDS ARE IN DANGEW!\"\n",

        "text": "As promised... our final tale of ThatGuy.\n\nFollowing Dragon Knight's ascension to the top of the local region's Most Wanted list, then his mysterious-but-sinister retirement, ThatGuy needed a new character. It was decided that his character would be something simple. Something pure. Something with little mechanical complexity and straightforward motivations.\n\nThe GM handed him the purest Superman knockoff I've ever seen. And thus was Supernova born.\n\nWe also have another member to add to our growing cast: MarineBro. MarineBro wasn't with the group for terribly long, but he did throw himself into it. His character was Jigga Dobson, a sniper armed with a *very* handy superscience-tier set of rifles, ranging from bullets to lasers. Jigga was skilled, competent, and professional; three traits which one would have had a hard time finding concentrated in any one member of the existing group.\n\nThis happened some time after we brought down Prism and his gang of color-themed supervillains (the same group that Rage and his buddies were part of). Some of the PRISM group had escaped and were still causing trouble; the primary offender was a man codenamed Angel. We eventually found that Angel had some sort of crazy personality swap going on, and he had an alternate form, a semi-crystalline morphing dude with phasing abilities.\n\nWe had discovered that Angel's form-swap had predictable effects; they happened at predictable times and his motivations were not all that hard to figure out. Angel tended to go for shock and awe, showing up to show off with fancy energy blasts and other showy abilities. Taffy Puller could brawl with Angel somewhat evenly thanks to him being tough enough to stand up to a pounding, but nobody else on the team could take him for long and if we ever got close to winning Angel'd just fly off. Worse, though, was his alt-form; it could cleave through walls with its phasic claws, and not even TP could take much of a hit from this guy. The alt-form was also completely bloodthirsty, and in that form his only real motivation was to rack up a body count.\n\nWe determined that the alt-form was going to show up at a major New Year's celebration in the setting's Times Square equivalent. However, after the DK debacle and a lot of resistance to some more extremist movements, our group was on the local authorities' shit list and our warnings weren't likely to be heeded. They weren't going to cancel the celebration on our say-so.\n\nThe decision was made: We could not allow the slaughter to go down, so we hatched a plan that would allow us to disperse the crowd with a minimum of civilian casualties. The recently-added Dobson (who had made quite an impression, since his very first interaction with our party was blowing the Vandal Savage knockoff's head off; thankfully that's not actually that dangerous for the guy, but he did stay salty IC about it for some time, as you might expect) was the core of the plan.\n\nOur group would set up in ambush around the square, with Mister Fields and Dobson ready to take down the alt-form monster as soon as it appeared. That was phase 2, though; phase 1 was to get the crowd gone as quickly as humanly possible. To that end, we called on another of the Taffy Puller's odder abilities. In HERO terms, he had a heavily-limited Shapeshifting power; in layman's terms, given some time to do so he could physically remold his malleable facial structure, letting him disguise himself. He didn't have the skills to be anyone in *particular,* but he could easily hide himself as not-Taffy Puller any time he needed to.\n\nWe planted the Taffy Puller in the crowd, marked with this garish green leprechaun hat (so chosen because it was horribly out of place). At the appropriate time, Phase 1 went into effect.\n\nPhase 1 began with Jigga Dobson shooting the Taffy Puller in the face with his laser rifle from his sniper position.\n\nAs you might expect, this caused a grade-A panic among the crowd, especially as Dobson continued to blast various impressive-to-blast-but-not-dangerous targets like streetlights. For his part, the Taffy Puller helped sell the ruse by producing a realistic-looking fake blood using his Power skill; had anyone bothered to actually taste or smell it, they would have detected sweetness and a hint of strawberries, but everyone was too busy panicking and running to notice.\n\nWe had the square almost clear, aside from quite a few cops, before the monster showed up. And then, shortly after, that's when Supernova showed up.\n\nSupernova didn't know who to fight. The scene was pandemonium. The stragglers were running everywhere, cops were taking cover behind whatever they could and pointing guns at buildings, there was a sniper taking potshots at streetlights and windows, a dude covered in blood had just stood up off the street, and another guy was floating around hurling metal shrapnel at some creature made of crystalline material. The guy covered in blood suddenly sprouted a garish green Spandex-looking suit (the Taffy Puller's signature costume, formed of course out of a Fruit Rollups-style material using his powers), then threw a twenty-foot punch at the crystal dude.\n\nDuring the chaos Jigga whiffs and hits a cop car, starting a fire. A couple cops are stunned by the gas tank blowing. Supernova swoops to the rescue, unleashing his mighty frost breath to quell the flames... and rolls horribly, completely blowing what he had intended to do. Instead he hits the cop car on an angle and sets the now-half-frozen hulk to bouncing around, crushing the stunned cops to paste. To make matters worse, with the distraction, the freaking monster had made it into a nearby store and started using its claws to carve its way through walls; by the time everyone was done processing what had happened to the cops, he was gone.\n\nThe operation was blown, and while we'd successfully prevented a massacre we'd failed to apprehend the guy. We took Supernova away and proceeded to try to figure out exactly why things had hit the fan quite so thoroughly.\n\nIt was at that point that ThatGuy did the very best piece of roleplaying I've ever seen. And he didn't even realize he'd done it.\n\nHe hung his head in his hands, a little upset that his attempt to help had squashed the guys he was trying to protect, and he muttered, \"What good am I if I can't save everyone?\"\n\nConsidering his character is a massive Superman expy, I have a hard time imagining a more perfect line to sum up the day, or the character.\n\nThat campaign started to fragment some time later, as we churned through some members and the new ones wanted to play something different; I still have a few Taffy Puller stories, but a lot of plot points never came to fruition, sadly. \n\nNEXT TIME: The best Trip roll I've ever made",

        "text": "So the day starts off like any other day in Mordor: rainy, dreary, and otherwise perfect for the Uruk kind and their penchant for slavery. I decide to hunt some big game, and begin by targeting a war chief named Muggrish. Now, it seems in order to lure Muggrish out of his hidey hole in this big run down fortress is stealth kill 5 of his many, many units. So I start climbing, stabbing, having a generally good time sneaking and stabbing an Uruk here and an Uruk there. After the fourth kill i realize I'm about to be spotted by one of the forces, so i quickly take aim with my bow and shoot my onlooker in the face. Little did I realize my target was one of the Uruk captains until after I release my arrow. Fortunately, this captain had a vulnerability to getting shot in the head, so my one arrow was all it took. UNFORTUNATELY, as I stealth killed the last two targets I needed, another unseen enemy ran to the signal fire and alerted the entire encampment to my presence. This is where things start to fall apart, and at a rate I couldn't have fathomed.\n\nMuggrish arrives, and he is less than pleased at my presence. He starts running at me with a force larger than I'm used to fighting, and he's not alone it seems. Another unknown captain, by the name of Ra'sh Oath Breaker, joins the fray, proclaiming his eagerness to split my skull with his shield and lance. Now, I'm quite partial to my skull, so I take a defensive stance and parry and evade until I can use a combat finisher to deal large damage to either target. With forces all around me, things are not going my way. In better circumstances I could defeat both, yet my situation becomes worse with the addition to an unseen enemy dealing poison damage to me from a ranged position. I roll through the crowd of enemies when the perpetrator strikes, informing me that he, Borgu Bow Master, was back for revenge.\n\nNow, Borgu and I have a bit of history. In our first meeting, Borgu was a lowly archer who got the better of me in a fight against another captain, earning a killing blow against me and in turn gaining the title of Captain. Being the vengeful type, once I resurrect, I hunt down Borgu and kill him after interrogation by snapping his neck with magic. After few in game days and a dozen captains later, Borgu is back claiming he was brought back from the death to kill me. I again best him, this time slicing off his head as to make sure I kill him in a way he couldn't be brought back. Apparently Sauron is pretty handy with a burlap sack and some rope, because that was Borgu's attire when we met for the third time.\n\nBack to the situation at hand: being outnumbered and outgunned, I start to run from the fight. The Uruk and the Captains put me near death twice, each time I barely manage to fight for my life and escape. After climbing and fleeing through the fortress, I realize that the two captains had split from my target. Taking advantage of the situation, I quickly locate Muggrish and manage to frighten him by blowing up an explosive barrel, giving me an opening in which I decapitate the Captain. I take the time to heal, and then I turn to focus my efforts on Ra'sh and Borgu. Unfortunately, Borgu must have sensed I was going to murder him a third time, so he quickly fled the scene leaving only me, three dozen Uruks, and a very shielded, very healthy Ra'sh. I deal some damage to Ra'sh, but the numbers were still not in my favor so I decide to take a risk. I locate the cage of a Caragor, a large, deadly wolf like creature and unleash it upon the horde of enemies. Foolishly, I neglected to check Ra'sh's attributes, in turn not realizing that Caragors only make him angry, fully healing him. Once again, I start to run to re-think my strategy, only to run into yet another captain, Skoth the Metal Beater.\n\nNow, Skoth was only recently raised from the ranks to captain, but his presence brought yet more Uruks to the already out of hand situation. I bait him, Ra'sh, the Caragor, and the rest of the forces out into a courtyard overlooking a cliff in which I'll make my final stand. As I cut through wave after wave of enemies, I weaken both remaining captains to roughly half health. A combo finisher would be enough to severely weaken either, so I decide to pick Skoth because he was weaker. Skoth however decided he had other things to do so he started fleeing, only for me to grab him from behind and spin him around as half a dozen Uruks attack.. Skoth's body shielded me from the blows, taking enough damage to eliminate the captain. With only a few enemies remaining, I kill the remaining Uruks and shoot Ra'sh enough to weaken him severely, giving me the opportunity to interrogate him. After gaining the intelligence I need, I let out a sigh of relief as the last captain falls dead from a broken neck. I turn around, only to have Noru'k Ear Counter, another newly raised captain, challenging me to a fight. Extremely low on health and not knowing his attributes, I decide to take a risk by grabbing him. The risk paid off, as i proceed to fling him off the cliff, effectively ending the fight before it began, and ending the entire conflict. \n\nI came to hunt a single warchief, and ended up killing not only that him, but 4 other captains, and had a visit from an old friend.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Alright, so, I promised a Thatguy story.\n\nFirst, though, I need to introduce the other member of our band, Sneaky. Sneaky is a guy who tended to play more cerebral (and/or obtuse) characters. You won't find him playing a frontline fighter or blaster; he'd be the type to play a rogue or bard. The problem was that Sneaky also tended to have a bunch of hidden agendas that rarely came to fruition (hence the obtuse above).\n\nNominally his character, a Vandal Savage-knockoff immortal with no super abilities but some cool superscience tech made possible by multiple lifetimes of research, was the party leader. Sneaky tended to miss sessions, though, which didn't help his hidden-agenda angles; this was a major part of the reason why the Taffy Puller and Mister Fields tended to tackle most situations as a two-man partnership.\n\nNow, onto ThatGuy.\n\nUnlike your typical That Guy, ours wasn't too bad. The problem was, he didn't tend to think before he acted and usually wound up as scenery while things went on (when he actually attended). He wasn't a munchkin, or a powergamer; he was bland, bland, *bland.*\n\nThatGuy's character was the Dragon Knight, a badass (on paper) magical warrior who spent a significant chunk of his points on an actual red dragon follower. The dragon was, itself, nasty enough that I wouldn't want to tangle with it without a good reason, but considering this was an urban environment, difficulties in logistics were bound to happen.\n\n\nDragon Knight lived in an apartment building. His dragon lived on the roof. In the middle of a major metropolitan area.\n\nOne session, in an attempt to draw ThatGuy into having some form of character development while TP+MF were off busting bad guys, the Dragon Knight encountered a problem.\n\nFucking **PETA** had set up a full-fledged press of bodies around his apartment and were screaming that his \"obvious enslavement of an innocent being\" and \"exploitation of an endangered species\" had to end with the \"innocent creature\" being returned to its natural habitat. (Never mind that the dragon itself was actually kind of an amoral asshole who pretty much just did what DK said because he didn't have anything better to do.)\n\nYes, dear readers, you heard that right: a mage-knight with the ability to shoot fire from his hands was being heckled by a bunch of hippies. ThatGuy was completely and 100% out of his element. Here was a problem he couldn't flame, and he couldn't ignore it.\n\nLaughing, Sneaky and I suggested that he just take the simple route out have Big Red go on a strafing run of the crowd. Sneaky had a good sense of humor, and I've always had my Loonie tendencies anyway. We joked that nobody would miss a bunch of PETA hippies.\n\nWhen ThatGuy announced that he was going to do that, the entire table boggled and went silent, Sneaky and I turning red while we tried to choke back the laughter, as the GM tried to recover. He resorted to playing the dragon and asking if he was sure, in-character, via psychic connection with the Dragon Knight, and for reasons I'll never understand, ThatGuy said he was.\n\nThe protest did not last long once a magical reptile the size of a bus swept over the crowd and burned a line of civilians to a crisp. Mass panic immediately erupted, sirens were going off everywhere, and it began to dawn on ThatGuy that he'd made a horrible error. And all the while, Sneaky and I couldn't hold back one more second. We were sitting there laughing our asses off, the GM was looking at his notes with a thousand-yard stare, and ThatGuy was trying to figure out how badly he'd messed up.\n\nAs a credit to the GM, he didn't initiate a Scratch, he carried on. ThatGuy boarded his dragon and got the Hell out of dodge before the police choppers could show up.\n\n\n\nAt this point, Dragon Knight was basically the most-wanted villain in the city. In one glorious moment, we'd managed to accidentally talk a player into committing an act so atrocious that the official hunt for his ass took greater priority than that of the supervillain we were actively investigating. Had ThatGuy been a better player, this would have been dinging somewhere around three-quarters of a Henderson; as it was, he only really made it to a quarter of a Henderson before things got snuffed.\n\nDragon Knight spent the rest of his term as a character hiding, trying not to get snapped up by authorities and using his connections to other players to get our help with it. You'd think that transporting a freaking dragon in a semitruck container would end badly, for example, but that was relatively uneventful.\n\n\nEventually, the Dragon Knight was summoned before a council of mages. He showed up in the little magical dimensional-fold they were hanging out in, and he was faced with a who's-who of the biggest names in the magical world. Every major mystic in and around the city was there, and every one of them were pissed as hell and demanding to know why they shouldn't just strip him of his powers.\n\nA bastard could have spun a tale about how he'd done it to save the crowd, that someone had been planning on attacking the crowd and only by dispersing them with the maximum of force, to ensure complete and mindless flight, could he protect them. An eloquent man could have talked of mistakes past and swayed their minds with a heartfelt vow to atone for the misdeed. A smart man could have thrown the dragon under the bus, blamed a momentary lapse in his control over it taking such an action on its own initiative, and begged the aid of the Council in strengthening his magical controls over the beast if they would allow it to live.\n\nThatGuy's argument? \"I dunno.\"\n\nNo amount of attempts to tease out some actual roleplaying could get the frozen-on-the-spot ThatGuy to offer up even the semblance of a defense. What it DID, though, was needle him enough to get him irritable. And an irritable ThatGuy called the council out and asked why they had the right to tell him what to do.\n\nSo they stripped him of all his magical abilities and kicked him out onto the street. Now abandoned by everyone, Dragon Knight suffered the ultimate betrayal: ThatGuy retired him, tossing him aside so he could make a \"better\" character.\n\nDon't cry for Dragon Knight, though... the GM kept his character sheet, with a grin on his face...\n\n\nDon't worry folks, we're not quite done with ThatGuy's antics yet. I've got one more.\n\nNext Time: In which we enact a plan that involves our team sniper firing into the crowd at a Times Square-equivalent New Years celebration.",

        "text": "(The newly founded Thorvald Saga was originally supposed to be the backstory only. Due to the response I got (2 other comments) I have decided that is not enough and shoot for more. (I'm a greedy bastard.) Thus the tale continues. In accordance with the backstory I shall wright in the same format, looking at ingame only. This was played out with a singular DM, myself and a good friend of mine. Lore will be explained)\n\nThorvald, wrecked with grief over the loss of his chickens, was nothing. His more intelligent brother Jarvand understood that the world was now open to them. \n\nNo longer did they have to wait on their mother. No longer did they have family to really on! No longer did they have to work! With the inheritance that their father had... Hidden...\n\nTheir father has died.\n\nShit.\n\nJarvand knew that they would not be able to survive off of their lowly funds, even if it is just the two of them. They needed to find something more purposeful, more fulfilling.\n\nMore power.\n\nThey had heard rumors of a new religion on the rise, the Fellowship of the Living Tree. The Fellowship was a quickly growing power out north and Jarvand knew that rising in power would be easier the earlier they enter.\n\nAfter a fairly eventful pilgrimage involving several bandits and a troll who was crushed by Thorvald, they entered the holy city of Garten.\n\nGarten was the epitome of religion. The Fellowship was only a year old and has already consumed the city to the degree that there were flags of The Living Tree on every building.\n\nThis level of devotion concerned Jarvand but Thorvald was only amazed at what he saw. There were hundreds of people! He saw acrobats in the street, pretty women in cloth being really nice, even a very dirty man who asked for money.\n\nBeing the kind soul he was, Thorvald took all of his money and gave it to the beggar, who's face shined with glee, jumping and dancing in happiness.\n\nJarvand was furious. The money that was to be used for their home, food and weapons was gone, shelled out to some homeless bum. Jarvand was about to let loose another rant when:\n\n\"Hello, I am Berra Farkler (Berra being a leader of a branch of The Fellowship). I am the resident pastor for this section of the city. I have seen what you two good souls have done and I would like to invite you into my Drahd until you get on your feet.\"\n\nBefore Thorvald could offer and \"ideas\" Jarvand accepted.\n\nAfter a few months of doing small jobs and little work for the Berra, Farkler asked the duo to do a job for him.\n\n\"There are some... Infidels that are trying to introduce their god into Garter. They need to be taken care of.\"\n\nAfter some protest the Berra threatened with expelling them from The Fellowship if they refused.\n\nThey had no choice but to kick ass.\n\n(Leave what you think in the comments. Ask questions if you want but I'm not gonna spoil it. Part 2 will come later.)",
