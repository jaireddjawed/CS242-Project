Three months ago I was invited to attend a church conference by a good friend.  The preacher had a message of hope and redemption that touched me and weighed on my heart.  When he invited people to come and pray I felt a strong urge to go.  My friend looked at me and said he'd go with me to the altar.  We walked down to the altar and the man that prayed for me knew my life with an amazing specificity.  I asked Jesus to forgive me of my sin, come into my heart and be my Lord and savior.  My friend died from an aneurysm two days later.  I was sad but I have peace knowing that he went to be with the Lord.  I read the entire king James bible.  Before my friend passed, he told me to find a good bible based church.  As a new Christian, I'm flabbergasted with the amount of different denominations.  I'm desperately trying to find a church.  I have gone to a different church every Wednesday and Sunday for three months.  Everyone has a different worship experience.  It seems daunting with the number of churches in my area.  When I was a Muslim it was pretty cut and dry.  Some LDS members came by and threw me for a loop.  I'm becoming more and more discouraged.  Does anyone have any suggestions?","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678671143.0},{"title":"Happy 10th anniversary of Pope Francis as the Vicar of Jesus Christ!","author":"usopsong","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/11q3w09","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678695422.0},{"title":"Blessing my mom's new build home","author":"So_Cal_Grown","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/gd4ksenqvena1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678653848.0},{"title":"How Far Does Your Faith Go?","author":"TriceratopsWrex","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11qgkyt\/how_far_does_your_faith_go\/","text":"I'm curious as to how far peoples' faith goes.\n\nThe bible is full of passages where Yahweh orders his followers to kill innocent women and children, including those still in the womb of the mother.

After the death of his parents, he withdrew at age fifteen into a monastery, where he received monastic tonsure. In search of complete solitude, he went off into the heart of the desert where the River Euphrates separates Syria from Persia. There he came upon an Elder named Maium and settled there with him. Both ascetics led a very strict life. During the forty days of the Great Fast they ate nothing, taking delight and joy instead in spiritual nourishment.\n\nEvery day Saint Aninas carried drinking water from afar. Once, he returned with full water pitchers earlier than usual, since an angel had filled the vessels with water. The Elder Maium realized that his disciple had attained to high level of spiritual accomplishment, and he in turn asked Saint Aninas to become his guide, but the Saint refused out of humility. Later, the Elder went to a monastery, and Saint Aninas remained alone in the wilderness.\n\nBy constant struggles the saint conquered the passions within himself, and he was granted gifts of healing and clairvoyance. Even the wild beasts became docile and served him. Wherever the saint went, two lions followed after him, one of which he had healed of a wound on its paw.\n\nAccounts of the saint spread throughout all the surrounding area, and the sick and those afflicted by evil spirits began to come to him, seeking healing. Several disciples also gathered around the saint. Once, in his seventeenth year as an ascetic, several men had come to the saint and asked for something to quench their thirst. Relying on the power of God, the saint sent one of his disciples to a dried-up well. The well miraculously filled up to its very top, and this water remained for many days. When the water ended, the saint did not dare to ask for a miracle for himself, and so he began to carry water from the Euphrates at night.\n\nBishop Patrick of Neocaesarea repeatedly visited the monk and ordained him presbyter, although the humble ascetic was resolved not to accept the priestly office. When he learned that the saint himself carried water from a distance, Bishop Patrick twice gave him donkeys, but each time Saint Aninas gave them away to the poor and continued to carry the water himself. Then the bishop ordered that a large well be dug, which they filled from time to time, bringing donkeys from the city.\n\nSaint Aninas discerned the desire of a certain stylite monk, who struggled far from him, to come down off his pillar and make a complaint in court against a robber who had hurt him with a stone. Saint Aninas wrote a letter to the stylite, advising him not to carry out his intent. The letter was brought to the stylite by a trusty lion, and it brought him to his senses.\n\nA certain pious woman, who had fallen ill, went to Saint Aninas to ask for his prayers. Along the way a robber chanced upon her. Since the woman had no money, he decided to assault her and force her into sin. The woman called on the saint\u2019s help and cried out, \u201cSaint Aninas, help me!\u201d Terror suddenly overcame the robber, and he let go of the woman.\n\nThe woman went to Saint Aninas and told him everything, and she also received healing. The robber also came to the monk in repentance, was baptized, and then tonsured as a monk. A spear which he had thrust into the ground when he attacked the woman, grew into a mighty oak.\n\nAt the age of 110 the saint predicted the time of his death, and he directed his successor as igumen to assemble the brethren.\n\nBefore his death, Saint Aninas conversed with the holy Prophets Moses, Aaron and Or (or Hur: Ex. 24:14). He fell asleep in the Lord saying, \u201cO Lord, receive my soul.\u201d\n\n_____________\n\n*Troparion \u2014 Tone 8*\n\nBy a flood of tears you made the desert fertile, and your longing for God brought forth fruits in abundance.

Moses Abraham etc. concerning matters of burnt-offerings and sacrifices, nor did God command the Hebrews in the day of bringing them out of Egypt concerning sacrifice and burnt-offerings.\n\nSo this alone is weird, but there are many apologists, both Christian and Jewish, who will try to say that the proper interpretation here is that this is some sort of a hyperbole.\n\nBut it gets better (or worse depending on your views)\n\nBecause we know the chapter and verse marking are not existent in any original writing, they flowed together. So we continue reading in Jeremiah 8:8\n\n>8:8 \u201cHow can you say, \u2018We are wise, And the law of Yahweh is with us\u2019? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.\"\n\nSo clearly when all is put together, Jeremiah the prophet does not think the Torah has been properly preserved, but that men (scribes) haves injected improper teachings, turning the law of Yahweh into a lie.\n\n>Matthew 23:13 \u201cBut woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo then I also started to notice the differences in teaching and big-picture messages contrasted between the Torah and the Prophets. The Torah is pro-war with the desire (politically, materially) for the success of the nation of Israel...the Prophets are pro-peace, disregarding the wealth of the material world in favour of spiritual wealth. It indeed seems like the Torah was written by ruling politicians and Kings rather than a loving God\n\nBut the New Testament (maybe should be named \"renewed\" testament as it is returning man to the true covenant of Abraham), the New Testament says Israel is not even a physical nation, but was always a people of faith, not by physical birth; God's people were not ones physically born Hebrew and circumcised in the flesh, but they are people who truly follow God and the Spirit of Truth, circumcised in the heart of their evil desires.\n\nAnd of all the different Christian denominations, the one closest to all these insights is none other than the Marcionites. For it was they who knew that the \"scriptures\" were corrupted by man and had to be restored, they knew the big-picture was love and peace, and that God also must be for love and peace; instead of war-hungry and cruel.\n\nAnd as Marcion pointed out, not even the New Testament was free from the deceit of the pen of man, people so blind by the false Torah (the literal, plain reading of the Torah) that they felt the urge to change the teachings of Jesus to coincide with the Torah. But thank God we have Jeremiah to tell us that the Torah is corrupt, thus any teaching of Jesus that coincides with the Torah is also corrupt. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo the \"god\" behind the heart of these evil men who have attempted to corrupt and change the truth of God is the same as the \"god of this age\/world\"\n\n>2 Corinthians 4:4 in whose case the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\"\n\nAKA the prince of the power of the air\n\n>Ephesians 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience,\n\nSo the \"god\" behind biblical literalism is none other than Satan. It turns out the bible has not been the Word of God, rather has been the word of satan this whole time.\n\nThis is the great deception of which we ought to awaken out of. Turn to love and peace, joy and happiness. Turn to true worship of God in Spirit and in Truth.\n\nBut I know these are hard words and sayings too hard to accept for most of you, you who have a love for the words of man more than the spiritual words of God which are spoken directly to the soul so as to be uncorrupted by the pen of scribes or the lips of wolves.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678717297.0},{"title":"\"Christianity that Is Appealing to Atheists\" by Forrest Antemesaris (October 11, 2018)","author":"TheTalkedSpy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11qdppn\/christianity_that_is_appealing_to_atheists_by\/","text":"I was a happy atheist. I didn't sense a need for any kind of religion  in my life. However, I wasn't completely closed-minded toward religion.  I visited a Baptist service, a Catholic Mass, and dabbled in the  teachings of Buddhism (my favorite at the time). Yet, religion in all of  its forms still seemed like nothing more than a collection of  antiquated fairy tales \u2014 and I felt this way, particularly about  Christianity. It seemed so divided, contradictory, intellectually  dishonest, and hypocritical. If you had asked me what I thought about  Christianity, I would have said that Christians lived with an illogical,  fear-inspiring blind faith in some kind of magic old guy in the clouds  with a beard. (Today I shudder to think how blasphemous these words  truly are.)\n\nSlowly, as I exposed myself to Christianity, I became  impressed. Christianity started to make sense. I couldn't stand it  because I wanted my assumptions and biases to be true, but a shift was  occurring.\n\nAs I reflect back on my time as an atheist visiting  with and studying the church, there were certain characteristics of  Christianity that were appealing, especially for me \u2014 someone with no  faith at all.\n\n## Genuine Christianity\n\nHypocrisy has dealt a  large blow to Christianity. One hypocrite can scar an unbeliever for  life. While those in the church should have a faith rooted in God and  therefore be undismayed (though disappointed) by hypocrisy, we can't  expect those who are skeptical of Christianity to do likewise. Hypocrisy  doesn't necessarily prove that Christianity is false, but it certainly  will not attract non-Christians. The New Testament is clear that our  conduct as Christians can either help or be a detriment to those outside  of the body (cf. [John 13:35](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2013.35); [17:21](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2017.21); [I John 2:5](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/1%20John%202.5), [10](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/I%20John%202.10); [3:10-14](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/I%20John%203.10-14); [4:20-21](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/I%20John%204.20-21)).  \n When Christians let their light shine and have their conversation honest, even atheists may eventually \"*glorify God on the day of visitation*\" ([I Peter 2:12](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/1%20Pet%202.12)).  We cannot expect to get anywhere with atheists if we ourselves do not  live as Christ in our daily lives. When I, as an atheist, was surrounded  by genuine Christians, I was much more eager to hear them out.\n\n## Intellectually-Honest Christianity\n\nAtheists  (for the most part) have thought their way into atheism (or at least  have seemingly logical reasons for having no faith). If you ask an  atheist why they have no faith, they will more than likely give you  several reasons grounded in thought. So, when an atheist gets into a  discussion with a Christian and that Christian cannot offer any ounce of  reasoning, rationale, or logic for why they believe what they believe,  that atheist will feel as if Christianity has nothing to offer him.\n\nMore  than likely, those who have rejected Christianity do so for what they  see as intellectual reasons (though emotion always plays a part). So,  Christians should be able to reason about their faith efficiently and  courageously ([I Peter 3:15](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/1%20Pet%203.15)).  Christianity that is appealing to atheists must be intellectually  honest, and logically sound. Thankfully, biblical Christianity is just  that. Once I was exposed to Christianity defended by sound logic and  rationale, I was immediately interested as an atheist even when I wasn't  yet convinced.\n\n## Christ-Magnifying Christianity\n\nAs an  atheist, I lacked any kind of spiritual fulfillment. Of course, I was  spiritually ignorant and assumed true spirituality was some kind of  superstitious, tingly feeling. As it turns out, spiritual fulfillment is  more than a feeling. It is something you can know ([I John 5:13](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/1%20John%205.13)) and is only found in Jesus Christ ([John 14:6](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2014.6)).  Christianity that magnifies Christ is vital if we are to appeal to  atheists because Jesus Christ is the most significant figure in history \u2014  the source of reality and truth, the head of the church, and the  foundation of the faith. His existence is rationally undeniable, His  words are challenging, His love is incomprehensible, and His example is  unprecedented.\n\nOften times we are scared to discuss the challenging teachings of Jesus with skeptics (i.e. [Matthew 18:8-9](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Matt%2018.8-9); [Mark 10:1-12](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Mark%2010.1-12); [Luke 13:3](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Luke%2013.3); [14:26](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Luke%2014.26)).  But the blunt truth is that we cannot win people to Jesus if we're  ashamed of any His teachings. The fact of the matter is, nobody else has  ever taught with the authority of Jesus. His words prove His divinity.  Likewise, the prophecies He fulfilled and the love He displayed are some  of the strongest proofs. Ultimately, it was Jesus who drew me to  Christianity.\n\n## Undenominational Christianity\n\nAs an  atheist, one of the most unappealing aspects of Christianity was the  division I saw in Christendom. The fact that I could find 20 different  churches on one street that all disagreed with each other on major  doctrines seemed to contradict their claim to be from God. Therefore, I  thought, Christianity must be a sham. There was simply too much division  for it to be from God. I still remember explaining this sentiment to a  Christian I was studying the Bible with and he responded, \"You're right!  I agree.\" I was shocked. Then, as I began studying the New Testament  myself, I realized that the denominational division we see today is  completely absent from the Christianity described in the Bible.\n\nI began connecting Scriptures like [Matthew 16:18](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Matt%2016.18), where Jesus says that He will build His church (singular), with Scriptures that describe the church as Christ's body ([Eph. 1:22-23](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Eph.%201.22-23)) and that \u2014 if Christ is the head \u2014 there can only be one body ([Ephesians 4:4](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Eph%204.4); [Romans 12:5](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Rom%2012.5); [I Corinthians 12:12-13](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/1%20Cor%2012.12-13), [20](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/I%20Corinthians%2012.20)).  I remember thinking that the division in Christendom today was even  more extreme than the division so heartily condemned by Paul in [I Corinthians 1:10](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/1%20Cor%201.10).\n\nI understand why Jesus prayed that His followers \"may all be one\" so that \"the world may believe\" that God sent Him ([John 17:21](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/John%2017.21)). When the division that exists in Christendom today is present, it becomes a hurdle for unbelievers.\n\nUndenominational  Christianity appeals to atheists because the contradiction and division  of denominationalism are blatantly illogical and, to my initial  surprise, unbiblical. When I realized that I could simply follow Jesus  and not participate in man-made and God-condemned divisions, I was even  more interested. For some skeptics, this might not be a big deal, but it  was for me.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSometimes, it is easy for the faithful to read verses like [Hebrews 11:6](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Heb%2011.6)  and conclude that atheists are too far gone to try to reach with the  gospel. But, when Christians are genuine, intellectually honest,  Christ-magnifying, and undenominational, a lot of good can happen.  Hopefully, Christ's body can continue to reach out to those with no  faith at all. I know firsthand that such people are not a lost cause.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678723560.0},{"title":"Does anyone else struggle with NOT wanting someone in Heaven?","author":"5cheeserigatoni","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11qd99y\/does_anyone_else_struggle_with_not_wanting\/","text":"As terrible as that sounds I know\u2026 we\u2019ll be healed and new bodies and likely I won\u2019t even remember the abuse I faced from him - but at this moment in my earthly body I never ever want to see him again.

My mental health deteriorated, I\u2019ve been completely lost. Let me say that for the past 24 years since birth, I have been someone that hasn\u2019t followed or believed very much in our Lord, but he\u2019s always someone I would blame for mishaps so I know he was out there subconsciously. Last year was the turning point. God worked through one of my friends I\u2019ve had since my childhood. Persistent to the point where I got annoyed with my friend a little bit. I think my annoyance came from me having a devil ridden mind. I accepted the devil but in turn I would hate God like I was friends with Satan. Well, last year, my downfall, my friend said something to me and one day I snapped. I told him word for word, \u201cIf there\u2019s a situation where I turn to God then I\u2019ll turn to Him, but I will not force my prayer to Him when I don\u2019t believe.\u201d Those words that I spoke to my friend, became a reality very shortly after.

It was Him. It wasn\u2019t the Devil. Whether it was a test from God, or Him showing me that He was there all along, I now understood the meaning of life.

Prior to that moment, they have no abilities above and beyond a lay person. To my knowledge most, but not all, of the Reformed Churches do not teach that a bishop\/Church leadership laying hands on someone gives them powers, but it authorizes them to use those powers (inherent in being baptized)  or is giving them community recognition.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a subtle distinction, but a similar way to think about it is if it were pregnancy. The Reformed perspective is that a woman who is pregnant does not magically become pregnant when a doctor diagnoses her as such (i.e. the Reformed Church does not give candidates special powers, but recognizes and authorizes them to use those powers). She is pregnant all along and the doctor merely recognizes her actual state. Whereas the Catholic and Orthodox position is that you are not pregnant until the doctors diagnoses you as such. \n\nIn the Catholic context I remember a lot of serious men having tons of angst discerning their vocational calling (marriage \/ priesthood). Several times there were discussions along the lines of value you could bring to society\/ family etc. by being a priest (expanding confession opportunities, celebrating masses for people etc.). In my own case working in emergency medicine I often think it would be great if I were a priest and could anoint those who were at the point of death because frankly clergy often arrive long after their death. Unfortunately my state (married man) does not allow for me to be a priest as the rules are now. Even now as a married man well established in my career I find myself wondering if I should have gone that way not necessarily because I think I would have preferred to be a celibate full time parish priest, but because I could see priestly ministry incorporated into my own career and life (medicine and teaching).\n\nI\u2019m curious if those from a Reformed background find this state of envy to be a completely foreign concept since their ministers do not have powers above and beyond other lay people (other than knowledge, prudence and wisdom cultivated over a lifetime of ministry).\n\nThanks for your comments.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678733595.0},{"title":"Thank the doctors, not God","author":"daywalkerredhead","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11qi0j4\/thank_the_doctors_not_god\/","text":"How do you all feel about this?\n\nI see this come up all the time whenever there's a major medical emergency that goes viral or something.\n\nPersonally, I'm praying to God so that he can help out with everything going on in the situation.

I believe God is the center of light, I believe Jesus is my savior, but I don\u2019t believe in what man has constructed to express it. I still believe in God and Jesus, I have experiences in my life where I shouldn\u2019t be here, but I feel I was saved by God. I know I won\u2019t be in my life where I am now without God, and I\u2019ve never lost sight of that, but I can definitely do without religion. Whenever I try to seek guidance about this dilemma I am going through, I just get told I\u2019m shrouded in sin, that I can\u2019t be saved, that I shouldn\u2019t be asking these questions and just have faith. I haven\u2019t gotten any legitimate advice on this, hence I\u2019m here. \n\n\n\nTL;DR:\nI can do without religion, but I can\u2019t do without God","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678690915.0},{"title":"please help me","author":"Helpme_please121","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11q2ls3\/please_help_me\/","text":"please could you pray for me to be able to overcome intrusive thoughts about lust or watching \\_\\_\\_\n\ni try to push the thoughts away but i have been finding it hard to sometimes, i feel like because of my own actions and fault i created a root in my mind and thats the main thing ive been struggling with although i know this is my own fault. i have been finding it really difficult to overcome this\n\ni really really don't want to struggle with this anymore\n\ni try to push it away as much as i can the temptations but i also do not want it to come back. i don't want to be in a repetitive cycle anymore i just want to overcome this once and for all. please please help me \n\nplease could you pray for me","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678690665.0},{"title":"Would anyone be interested in a sort of book club?","author":"McClanky","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11qb390\/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_sort_of_book_club\/","text":"I was curious if anyone would be interested in having a book club on the subreddit?

It also seems like anytime these Christians get into the newspaper or on the local news they are seemingly speaking for all Christians.\n\nThere is no place in Christianity for hate or bigotry. I am sick of lost or confused Christians spewing hate about whatever topic they feel the need to speak on *behalf of* Christianity regarding, i.e., LGBT, drag queens reading to kids, the books that are in the school\u2019s library, etc. \n\nI would say it is obvious they aren\u2019t reading their Bible but maybe they just need to pick up a different version that they can understand because they\u2019re not getting it. \n\nThese Christians run new members away from the church or even the youth by misinterpreting scripture or not having the right context when they are referring to certain topics and misleading people.\n\nAs a Christian, the most important thing we can do is LOVE EVERYONE with all our heart, the New Testament makes this very clear. Another thing that is made clear in the New Testament is that no matter who you are or what group(s) you belong to, if you have Faith that Jesus Christ exists and believe He is who He says He is, He will take care of the rest, he says this while referring to the 613 laws in the OT. People seem to confuse those laws for a checklist of who can and can\u2019t be Christians. He also makes it clear that he isn\u2019t talking about just having love for your friends or family but EVERYONE. \n\nWe should be calling this type of behavior out when we see it and making it clear that their actions or words are not Christ-like and do not represent Christianity.\n\nSo, Christians, there are 2 options\u2026you can try your best every day to LOVE EVERYONE with all your heart or you can find a different religion that condones hate, it is very simple. \n\nCould you imagine what a great place this would be if everyone that says they are Christian actually practiced spreading love and kindness to all?

I often alternate between Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox churches.\n\n___________ \n\nToday's readings:\n\nHebrews 1:10-2:3\n\n>To the Son He says: \u201cYou, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. They will perish, but You remain; and they will all grow old like a garment; like a cloak You will fold them up, and they will be changed. But You are the same, and Your years will not fail.\u201d But to which of the angels has He ever said: \u201cSit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool\u201d? Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation? Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away. For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him?\n\nMark 2:1-12\n\n>And again He entered Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house. Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And He preached the word to them. Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men. And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, \u201cSon, your sins are forgiven you.\u201d And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, \u201cWhy does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\u201d But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, \u201cWhy do you reason about these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, \u2018Your sins are forgiven you,\u2019 or to say, \u2018Arise, take up your bed and walk\u2019? But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014He said to the paralytic, \u201cI say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.\u201d Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, \u201cWe never saw anything like this!\u201d\n\nWith this Sunday, we have accomplished the second week of Lent. Let us not burn ourselves out already, we still have a long path ahead and much progress to make.\n\nHere is for today an important message concerning the fast. Why do we put ourselves through this? Is it for any kind of spiritual feat we might take pride in or despair about? No, but it is a necessary preparation for Easter, or rather, it is a necessary prelude to Holy Week, an extremely important time when we will share in Christ's passion as we will follow His final week in Jerusalem.\n\nThe fast is not merely about fasting from food. But rather, fasting is a tool: by decreasing our intake of filling and heavy foods, we prevent the stomach from exhausting our whole body with the process of digestion, so that we may have greater focus on praying to God and on taking care of others around us.\n\nIt is a thorny path that we tread upon. But it is necessary for one to acquire the virtues and to truly encounter the Lord at least once in one's life. May we be blessed to encounter Him many times however! But if we cannot encounter Him at least once in our life here and now, how will we encounter Him in eternal life? Let us therefore do the necessary to truly and intimately meet Him in this life through the practice of fasting, that we may tolerate meeting Him at the resurrection.\n\nBut, we seek after Him and try to see Him only because He first sought after us and tried to see us. He first loved us, and we respond in kind by loving Him Who loved us. Indeed, God loves us and has nothing but love for us when He gazes upon us: in spite of all our stains and failings, the human being is inherently *beautiful*, and extremely so. And so, by loving mankind generally and people individually, including ourselves, we love the Lord who loves us.\n\nMay this Lenten fast teach us to love man and to love God!","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678670178.0},{"title":"These kids are so cute!

To be \"baptized in the Spirit\" afterwards. I disagree with this view completely. My view is probably unique on this front because I fully believe the Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Trinity, sent by the Father and the Son to be with believers now that the Lord is at the right hand of the Father. But do bare with me as I dig a little. \n\nSo here's my view, the \"Separate Receipt\" view of the Holy Spirit:\n\nWhen the Lord Jesus was resurrected, before He left He promised to send the Holy Spirit to be with His followers. And when in Acts 2 the Holy Spirit came upon the 120 followers in the upper room they all manifested the Spirit by speaking in tongues. The entire book of Acts then following their journey as the Spirit leads them with signs & wonders, especially His gifts for the ministry of Jesus Christ. But here's my view exactly -: contrary to most believers I am convinced the Lord Jesus is actually NOT on Earth at all now, but through the Spirit He can appear to us as He did to Paul. Yet actually He isn't here. He's at the right hand of the Father, in Heaven.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to popular belief, belief in Jesus only saves you\u2014it does not give you the Holy Spirit, at all! Unless you separately in genuine faith ask and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, Who when He comes into you will come with a sign \u2014 whether it's speaking in tongues (Acts 2), or a miracle (Acts 9), or speaking in tongues and prophesying (Acts 19), etc. But one thing is certain, just because you're saved doesn't mean you have the Holy Spirit in you. And passages like Acts 8:14-17 tell us this clearly. \n\nWhat about the \"indwelling\" of the Spirit? In passages like 1 Corinthians 12-14 are where we find Paul talk about this. So many teach that there is a difference between being filled or baptized (they're literally the same thing, as immersion naturally leads to filling) from being indwelt with the Holy Spirit. They actually think it's possible for the Holy Spirit to be within you without filling you up or baptizing you? Even though in all instances where the Spirit comes into anyone in Acts they immediately baptized? But of course the idea is that the Holy Spirit can be within someone but only a portion of Him, until the person is full of the Spirit then He's fully there. This, I disagree with.\n\nMy understanding is simple. If you receive the Spirit He will fill you by baptizing you in Himself through the love of Christ in you. But this is different from being full of boldness or power, the Holy Spirit will regularly at His own will fill a believer with power or boldness if such a one needs it. This however doesn't mean the person is experiencing some different experience from the baptism of the Spirit, for it is because you're baptized in the Spirit that you're also baptized with fire! All through Jesus. As the prophet John the Baptist said \"for He who comes after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire\"!\n\nHence, in chronological order:\n\n1. Being saved doesn't mean you have the Holy Spirit.\n\n2. You have to separately receive the Holy Spirit AFTER you're saved, by genuine faith.\n\n3. When the Spirit falls on you, you would manifest a gift or more, whether it's speaking in tongues, prophesy, healing, or any other gift that can serve as a clear sign.\n\n4. The Spirit cannot dwell in you until you separately ask and receive Him in genuine faith, as you did the Lord Jesus, when you were saved. \n\nThus, these are my contraries to the popular view on these things. Please comment below your thoughts, I know that I could be wrong and I'm open to realizing that if I am, so please don't be condescending in your criticisms. Thank you.\n\nGrace of our Lord Jesus be with you.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678705545.0},{"title":"Struggling to believe","author":"surrealpelican","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11q6jti\/struggling_to_believe\/","text":"One thing that bugs me is when you ask where is the evidence to have faith or believe, they say the proof is Jesus came and died on the cross and went around speaking do miracles.. to me that seems like crap because I wasnt alive during that time, I didnt get to witness Jesus doing any of that stuff like disciples and people did, its like they had a hugeee advantage to having faith.

The wickedness of the abuse itself, as well as the cover ups is something that we see all the time reported in the media over the decades with bombshell report after bombshell report. Pope Francis isn't the first Pope to deal with this issue but he is the latest. He has of course condemned this abuse and apologised repeatedly. As a disclaimer this post is not meant to make the case that some how verbal condemnations and apologies are enough. It is a historical look though at theological precedents in condemning and tackling the issue of clerical abuse in terms of precedents and how that informs Pope Francis's current statements and views on the topic. So here goes.\n\n**(1)Theological precedents:**\n\n* *\"Parents and other Christians who give up their children to sexual abuse are selling others' bodies, and if they do so or sell their own bodies, they shall not receive communion even at death\"\\_Council of Elvira(Canon 12, 305 A.D)*\n* \"*Bishops, presbyters, and deacons, once they have taken their place in the ministry, shall not be given communion even at the time of death if they are guilty of sexual immorality. Such scandal is a serious offense\"\\_Council of Elvira(Canon 18, 305 A.D)*\n* *\u201cAny cleric or monk who seduces young men or boys, or who is apprehended in kissing or in any shameful situation, shall be publicly flogged and shall lose his clerical tonsure. Thus shorn, he shall be disgraced by spitting in his face, bound in iron chains, wasted by six months of close confinement, and for three days each week put on barley bread given him toward evening.\"*\\_St Basil the Great(4th century)\n* \u201c*Listen, you do-nothing superiors of clerics and priests. Listen, and even though you feel sure of yourselves, tremble at the thought that you are partners in the guilt of others; those, I mean, who wink at the sins of their subjects that need correction and who by ill-considered silence allow them license to sin. Listen, I say, and be shrewd enough to understand that all of you alike are deserving of death, that is, not only those who do such things, but also they who approve those who practice them.*\u201d\\_St Peter Damian(Letter 31)\n* \"*For if a kiss is struck with a punishment of such severe retribution, what does fornication between the thighs merit? For punishing what crime, for what monstrous offense would it not suffice to be publicly beaten, to lose the tonsure, to be disgracefully shaven, to be smeared with the filth of saliva, to be confined for a great length of time, and furthermore to be bound in iron chains? And finally it is prescribed that he is to be fed on barley bread, because he who has become like a horse and a mule is not properly refreshed with the food of men, but is fed with the grain of mules*.\"\\_St Peter Damian(Book of Gomorrah, chp XVI on abuse of adolescents or children)\n* \"*O unheard of crime! O offense to be mourned with a whole fountain of tears! If they who consent to those who do these things are to be struck with death, what can be conceived of as a worthy punishment for those who commit these evils, which are punishable by eternal damnation, with their spiritual children? What fruit can be found in the flocks, when the pastor is so profoundly submerged in the belly of the devil? Who might now remain under his rule who is not ignorant of his so hostile estrangement from God? Who makes a male prostitute out of penitent, a woman out of a man? Who subjugates as a slave him whom he spiritually generated as a son by God, through the iron rule of diabolical tyranny by the impurity of his flesh?*\"\\_St Peter Damian(Book of Gomorrah, chp VII)\n* \"*So that the deceits of diabolical machination may not lie hidden, but rather that I might expose to the light those things that the devil secretly constructs with his secretaries in the workshop of ancient evil, I will not suffer it to be concealed that certain individuals, satiated by the poison of this crime, when, as it were, they return to the heart, confess the sin to one another so that the crime may not be exposed to the notice of others. Although as authors of the crime they cause the faces of men to blush, they themselves become judges, and each one rejoices to extend to the other an indiscreet pardon, which he seeks to apply to himself by vicarious exchange. So it is that they might be penitents of great sins, and yet their mouths are not pallid by reason of fasting, nor their bodies wasted by leanness; and while their stomach is in no way restrained from the immoderate reception of food, the soul is shamefully inflamed in the fire of habitual lust, so that he who has not yet wept for his crimes, commits even more lamentable acts. It is a precept of law that when anyone is covered with leprosy he must be shown to the priests. However, when one filthy man confesses to another the common evil that has been committed, the leper is not shown to the priests but rather to another leper*\"\\_St Peter Damian(Book of Gomorrah, chp viii)\n* \"*So that the contagion of such a grave offense may not advance with greater audacity by taking advantage of impunity, which is the greatest incitement to sin, and so as to more severely punish the clerics who are guilty of this nefarious crime and who are not frightened by the death of their souls, we determine that they should be handed over to the severity of the secular authority, which enforces civil law Therefore, wishing to pursue with greater rigor than we have exerted since the beginning of our pontificate, we establish that any priest or member of the clergy, either secular or regular, who commits such an execrable crime, by force of the present law be deprived of every clerical privilege, of every post, dignity and ecclesiastical benefit, and having been degraded by an ecclesiastical judge, let him be immediately delivered to the secular authority to be put to death, as mandated by law as the fitting punishment for laymen who have sunk into this abyss*\"\\_Pope St Pius V(Horrendum Illud Scelus, 1568)\n* \"*We again commit to and ask the Inquisitors of Heretical Depravity and the Orders of every realm, of the provinces, states, dominions and locations of the whole Christian world, that they in their respective dioceses, diligently and with mortal respect, cast aside, seek out and proceed against everyone, every priest as much as seculares as regulares, however much exempt, and also those immediately subject to the Apostolic See, of whatever Orders, Institutions, Societies or Congregations, whether supported by the privilege or dispensation of any rank or preeminence-who have essayed to tempt a penitent, whoever that person is, in the act of sacramental confession, whether before or immediately after, whether on the occasion or pretext of confession, whether even outside the times of confession in the confessional, or in a place other than that designated for hearing confessions or in a place chosen for the alleged purpose of hearing confession; the object of this temptation is to solicit or provoke the penitent to impure and obscene matters, whether by words or signs or nods of heads , whether by touch or by writing, or after the note has been read....Let the Inquisitors punish with severely punish those whom they shall find guilty.*.\"\\_Pope Benedict XIV(Sacramentum Poenitentiae, 1741)\n* \"*Rape is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of another person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply wounds the respect, freedom and physical and moral integrity to which every person has a right. It causes grave damage that can mark the victim for life. It is always an intrinsically evil act. Graver still is the rape of children committed by parents or those responsible for the education of children entrusted to them*\"(Catechism of the Catholic Church, prg 2356)\n* \"*Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized. It prompted our Lord to utter this curse: 'Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.' Scandal is grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to wolves in sheep's clothing*\"(Catechism of the Catholic Church, prg 2285)\n\nNow a couple of interesting notes on what is mentioned above. Firstly when researching Medieval Christendom's attitudes to sexual abuse a fascinating aspect is demonstrated at the Council of Nablus in the Crusader states called by the Church leadership. It instituted many canons and one included penalties for if a Christian man sexually abuses or rapes a Muslim woman. The penalty is castration. Second interesting point is Pope Pius V, who issued that very harsh penalty on \"sodomy\"(which had a wide definition, including sexual relations with minors) is actually recorded as implementing his strict decree. In 1570 when a Canon was found having relations with a choir boy, he had him removed from his office and rank and then publicly beheaded. Furthermore, the office of the Inquisition was in charge of prosecuting cases of sexual abuse and pedophilia, many of which resulted in the death sentence.\n\nThis list though shows that in terms of condemnation of the crime of sexual abuse, clerical abuse and scandal in the Church this isn't a new thing. You have had reformers, activists, Church leaders, canonised saints along with Church teaching that does this. So in this context Pope Francis is not doing anything new. In this regard he is already standing on a centuries old foundation when it comes to doctrine and teaching on this issue. In this regard these are the ways these teachings, as well as the scandal itself, influences his perspective on these things in quotes:\n\n* \"*The sexual exploitation of children is yet another scandalous and perverse reality in present-day society. Societies experiencing violence due to war, terrorism or the presence of organised crime are witnessing the deterioration of the family, above all in large cities where, on their outskirts, the so call phenomenon of street children is on the rise. The sexual abuse of children is all the more scandalous when it occurs in places where they ought to be most safe, particularly in families, schools, communities and Christian institutions*\"\\_(Amoris Laetitia, prg 45)\n* \"*It is true that the scourge of the sexual abuse of minors is and historically has been, a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies, especially within families and in various institutions; its extent has become known primarily thanks to change in public opinion. Even so this problem, while universal and gravely affects our societies as a whole....is in no way less monstrous when it takes place within the Church. Indeed, in people's justified anger, the Church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted*\"\\_(Christus Vivit, prg 96)\n* \"*Abuse exists in various forms: abuse of power, the abuse of conscience, sexual and financial abuse. Clearly, the ways of exercising authority that make all this possible have to be eradicated, and the irresponsibility and lack of transparency with which so many cases have been handled have to be challenged. The desire to dominate, lack of dialogue and transparency, forms of double life, spiritual emptiness, as well as psychological weaknesses, are terrain on which corruption thrives. Clericalism is a constant temptation on the part of priests who see the ministry they have received as a power to be exercised, rather than a free and generous service to be offered. It makes us think that we belong to a group that has all the answers and no longer needs to listen or has anything to learn. Doubtless, such clericalism can make consecrated persons loses respect for the sacred and inalienable worth of each person and or his or her freedom*\"(Christus Vivit, prg 98)\n* \"*If one member suffers, all suffer together with it\u201d (1 Cor 12:26).\u00a0 These words of Saint Paul forcefully echo in my heart as I acknowledge once more the suffering endured by many minors due to sexual abuse, the abuse of power and the abuse of conscience perpetrated by a significant number of clerics and consecrated persons. \u00a0Crimes that inflict deep wounds of pain and powerlessness, primarily among the victims, but also in their family members and in the larger community of believers and nonbelievers alike. \u00a0Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient.\u00a0 Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated. \u00a0The pain of the victims and their families is also our pain, and so it is urgent that we once more reaffirm our commitment to ensure the protection of minors and of vulnerable adults*\"(Letter to the People of God, 2018)\n* \"*In recent days, a report was made public which detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years. Even though it can be said that most of these cases belong to the past, nonetheless as time goes on we have come to know the pain of many of the victims.\u00a0 We have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death; these wounds never go away. The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced. \u00a0But their outcry was more powerful than all the measures meant to silence it, or sought even to resolve it by decisions that increased its gravity by falling into complicity. \u00a0The Lord heard that cry and once again showed us on which side he stands. \u00a0Mary\u2019s song is not mistaken and continues quietly to echo throughout history.\u00a0 For the Lord remembers the promise he made to our fathers: \u201che has scattered the proud in their conceit; he has cast down the mighty from their thrones and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty\u201d (Lk 1:51-53).\u00a0 We feel shame when we realize that our style of life has denied, and continues to deny, the words we recite*.\"(Letter to the People of God, 2018)\n* \"*If one member suffers, all suffer together with it\u201d, said Saint Paul.\u00a0 By an attitude of prayer and penance, we will become attuned as individuals and as a community to this exhortation, so that we may grow in the gift of compassion, in justice, prevention and reparation. \u00a0Mary chose to stand at the foot of her Son\u2019s cross.\u00a0 She did so unhesitatingly, standing firmly by Jesus\u2019 side.\u00a0 In this way, she reveals the way she lived her entire life.\u00a0 When we experience the desolation caused by these ecclesial wounds, we will do well, with Mary....She, the first of the disciples, teaches all of us as disciples how we are to halt before the sufferings of the innocent, without excuses or cowardice.\u00a0 To look to Mary is to discover the model of a true follower of Christ. May the Holy Spirit grant us the grace of conversion and the interior anointing needed to express before these crimes of abuse our compunction and our resolve courageously to combat them.*\"(Letter to the People of God, 2018)\n* \"*The brutality of this worldwide phenomenon becomes all the more grave and scandalous in the Church, for it is utterly incompatible with her moral authority and ethical credibility. Consecrated persons, chosen by God to guide souls to salvation, let themselves be dominated by their human frailty or sickness and thus become tools of Satan. In abuse, we see the hand of the evil that does not spare even the innocence of children. No explanations suffice for these abuses involving children. We need to recognize with humility and courage that we stand face to face with the mystery of evil, which strikes most violently against the most vulnerable, for they are an image of Jesus. For this reason, the Church has now become increasingly aware of the need not only to curb the gravest cases of abuse by disciplinary measures and civil and canonical processes, but also to decisively confront the phenomenon both inside and outside the Church. She feels called to combat this evil that strikes at the very heart of her mission, which is to preach the Gospel to the little ones and to protect them from ravenous wolves. Here again I would state clearly: if in the Church there should emerge even a single case of abuse \u2013 which already in itself represents an atrocity \u2013 that case will be faced with the utmost seriousness. Brothers and Sisters: in people\u2019s justified anger, the Church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted by these deceitful consecrated persons. The echo of the silent cry of the little ones who, instead of finding in them fathers and spiritual guides encountered tormentors, will shake hearts dulled by hypocrisy and by power. It is our duty to pay close heed to this silent, choked cry. It is difficult to grasp the phenomenon of the sexual abuse of minors without considering power, since it is always the result of an abuse of power, an exploitation of the inferiority and vulnerability of the abused, which makes possible the manipulation of their conscience...Before all this cruelty, all this idolatrous sacrifice of children to the god of power, money, pride and arrogance, empirical explanations alone are not sufficient. They fail to make us grasp the breadth and depth of this tragedy...So what would be the existential \u201cmeaning\u201d of this criminal phenomenon? In the light of its human breadth and depth, it is none other than the present-day manifestation of the spirit of evil. If we fail to take account of this dimension, we will remain far from the truth and lack real solutions*\"(Address to the Protection of Minors in the Church, 2019)\n* \"*In response to cases of sexual abuse committed by members of the Church, its not enough to ask for forgiveness. Asking for forgiveness is necessary but not enough. Asking for forgiveness is good for the victims. But they are the ones who have to be at the centre of everything. Their pain and psychological wounds can begin to heal if they find answers, if there is concrete action to repair the horrors they have suffered, and to prevent them from happening again. The Church cannot try to hide the tragedy of abuse of any kind....The Church must serve as a model to solve these issues and bring it to light in society and families. The Church must offer safe spaces for victims to be heard, supported psychologically and protected. Let us pray for those who have suffered because of the wrongs done to them from members of the Church; may they find within the Church herself a concrete response to their pain and suffering*\"(Prayer Intention, March 2023)\n* \"*The best results and the most effective resolution that we can offer to the victims, to the People of Holy Mother Church and to the entire world, are the commitment to personal and collective conversion, the humility of learning, listening, assisting and protecting the most vulnerable. I make a heartfelt appeal for an all-out battle against the abuse of minors both sexually and in other areas, on the part of all authorities and individuals, for we are dealing with abominable crimes that must be erased from the face of the earth: this is demanded by all the many victims hidden in families and in the various settings of our societies*.\"(Address to the Protection of Minors in the Church, 2019)","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678703063.0},{"title":"What are some of your tips on getting closer to God?

A year later, in 2021, allegations came out against the man who was senior pastor during my time there, leading to his removal from the pulpit. I had started attending this church after literally escaping the cult I'd been a part of in mid-2015 and thought it was a good place to be at first...but when the news about the senior pastor came out, I started to realize that there were some red flags that had gone over my head looking back...anyplace was better than where I had come from. \n\nI was hesitant to accept what I was seeing at first, but later on, several people I ended up reconnecting with during that time shared their own experiences of being hurt by this church  and that sealed the deal for me. I had attended sporadically from 2018 onward, but was very disillusioned with it all because of my experiences and was there, but \"checked out\". I was done...for the time being, at least.\n\nThat same summer, I started going to pastoral counseling, which has helped me immensely in the last two years. I was diagnosed with Complex PTSD and unknowingly at the time, was paired with a counselor who is trauma informed. But even though I was making progress, I didn't see myself ever having any kind of relationship with God ever again. The thought of stepping inside a church filled me with terror and trying to read scripture would leave me with horrific emotional and sometimes visual flashbacks and even nightmares...but then, something changed.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was sitting in my local library reading a history book when I suddenly started thinking, \"you know, the Bible is sort of like a history book\". I had an urge to start reading, so I opened up a Bible reading app on my phone. Within 30 minutes, I read the first seven chapters of Genesis and then I couldn't do anymore. The anxiety and flashbacks came, but they weren't as bad. Then, four days ago, I got that same urge to read and did....not flashbacks, nothing. \n\nI picked up where I left off in Genesis 8 and finished Genesis this morning. I left off this evening on Exodus 4. I've never read the Bible in its entirety, so this is what I'm going to do until I finish it.

In these dreams they all seemed centered on fighting and crying out to jesus for help.\n\nThe first dream felt insanely realistic. I was in a house and was told by a friend in a dream that a strong demon was coming after me and we need to prepare to fight it. I was told not to look at it when it comes but I saw a huge purple and green eye look through the window when it came. It's name started with a H but I don't remember what it was. My friend gave me something and said to hold onto it and don't let it go and that I needed to pray.I pressed down on the button and it emitted a noise. I was transported to a new house with a random guy and I saw the eye again. I hunched down and started praying with the guy. It all felt insanely desperate and when I woke up I was in a hunched position on my bed lips moving still reciting prayers and my hand was still pressing down on something that wasn't there. It felt very very real.\n\nThe second time is a two part kind of reoccurring type of dream.\n I had a dream where I ventured to a town I heard rumors about. I was told this was a very trashy and poor town and people often went there to gawk at and make fun of the residents. I find the road there and I'm taken to this wooded area. The paved road becomes dirt and everything is surrounded by trees. The light was a yellow green and all I saw were decrepit trailers strewn around forming some sort of community.I remember feeling uneasy driving through. I don't recall seeing anyone but as I drove through I stumbled upon a new area vastly different than the wooded place. This place was gorgeous. All I saw were the bluest skies, the cleanest and deepest blue water and sand so white it looked like snow. I saw a huge building that was modern yet old looking with white stucco walls and lots of glasswork. I was drawn to it and went in. I remember going in and it was a very ornate and rich looking place. I was in a hallway that was busy with people dressed very well. I spotted my family and they told me a christmas pageant was going on. We were headed towards the church inside to see it. I lost them in the crowd and met this girl with very white blonde hair who ended up taking me to the church to sit with her. All I can remember about the church was that the wood was very dark colored and ornate and it was set up like an opera house with rows and rows of seating on various levels. I saw another girl with glasses and short brown hair looking over at me the whole time. She never said anything just caught her staring me down. I don't remember the pageant I just remember feeling panicked trying to find my family and that's all I can remember of the first dream.\n\nLast night my dream took me back to this place. I didn't go through the woods this time to get there I was instead in a parking lot in a SUV with my mother driving it. She wasn't elderly in this dream she was maybe in her 40s. I was much younger too. In the first dream I was young also.The parking lot was packed and she was struggling to find a spot. We found one and it was a tight fit with my mother complaining about the parking. We enter the building and instead of all the dark wood and ornate gold and burgundy wallpaper and decor I was in a hallway that was white marble floors and the walls were all glass which showed the water and sand below in the distance. I enter a classroom and I see my deceased best friend waving me down wanting me to sit with him. He is young also. I see the blonde girl from the church again talking with the brown haired girl with glasses. Blonde girl just smiles and talks to the brown haired girl who just looks at me. The teacher comes in and the class is a blur to me. I just remember the room was crammed full of these light pink and white desks which looked like marble but were shiny plastic and they were slippery to sit in. I have to use the restroom and my friend comes with me. Brown haired girl still stares at me and follows my movement out of the room with her eyes. I could feel it. We walk towards the restroom and everything in the building changes. The light gets darker and everything looks long abandoned and covered in cobwebs. We hear guitar playing and singing and see an old man wearing a burgundy robe making the music. He has a kind face with grey shaggy hair and a beard. My friend compliments his playing and at first the man gives thanks. We go to leave and he starts accusing my friend of being Mrs.Patton his old teacher. His face starts to change and he looks crazy screaming at us that Mrs.patton cannot hurt him anymore and he will get his revenge. He starts to chase us and we somehow wind up at the church. The church was different than before. It was abandoned and dirty and dark. The only light came through the stained glass windows which were bright red and black making everything look ominous. We hear his yelling and screaming and threats and try to hide and that's when sinead o connor came into the picture. I don't know why she was there but she was. I just remember her climbing up the wall to the ceiling like a spider and then lunging down on my friend. I dont remember what she was saying but I ended up fighting her to protect my friend. As soon as I was getting the upper hand my alarm went off for work. The last thing I can remember was punching her repeatedly in the gut.\n\nI'm not sure but I'm thinking these dreams are connected somehow. It's odd how I wound up in the same place twice and it seems to shapeshift. Something uneasy or bad always seems to happen there. I don't fully understand yet. It will be interesting to see if I'm taken there again.\n\nThe 4th time I was part of an elite squad trying to save jesus from being crucified. I had battled through various stages and I had a sword and had found out where he was being kept. I was sneaking around to that spot and was about to go through the door when I was jerked awake coughing my lungs out.\n\nThe most recent and final time felt desperate and urgent again.\n\nt started in a weird town but my family lived in it. I guess there had been attacks in town and people were afraid. My aunt owned a bakery in town and said she would be fine it was a short walk away to pick up a cake for my cousins birthday. I went with her and was on edge the entire time. We were in the bakery and about to leave when we saw it. It was a demon who looked like a man without eyes. Just black holes and he had a wide crazed grin. He attacked my aunt and i couldn't do anything i was frozen. A huge black dog that was wolf like came into the shop it was aggressive and growling at me. Somehow i was able to tame the wolf dog and it helped me ward off the eyeless man to run home.\n\nThe eyeless man followed me home and my grandmother was there. She brought out this box and it was rattling. There were wooden squares inside with some sort of chinese writing i couldn't read. I know some words and phrases but that's it. She told me it was a prison and that the wards wouldn't last forever unless I did something. She gave me an object the wooden square and i had quite the back and forth with the eyeless man. My grandmother disappeared and i panicked because i didn't know what to do. After bumbling and fumbling something came out naturally and there was lots of shouting and prayers and the dog showed up again to help. In the end i managed to get that thing into the box and it quit rattling.\n\nIt felt intense. I could feel a real sense of fear and dread in that dream. A real sense of desperation and urgency\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt's all got me thinking especially recently it's all a warning from god to turn back and come back. I've been thinking a lot about church recently and prayer and I actually attended a church service for the first time in about a good decade or so. I felt great afterwards. I don't believe these dreams are just dreams I really do think they are real in a way and was curious as to what others think or if anyone else had a similar experience .\nI was raised catholic and did attend catholic school for many years. I stepped away from religion in about 8th grade due to how disconnected i felt from the church and from religion as a whole. I think that residual amount of faith still left in me is what saved me and is what brought me back","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678666390.0},{"title":"Is free will actually a good explanation for why evil exists?","author":"epicccccccccc_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11pzei4\/is_free_will_actually_a_good_explanation_for_why\/","text":"A common answer of the question of why evil exists under an all-loving God is that evil exists because of the free will and choice of humans. \n\nWhile this is correct to some degree, I believe there is a fatal flaw in using this counter argument. \n\nIt is logical to assume that god has free will, or else he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to create the universe.

His father was a priest.\n\nHe enrolled at the parochial school in Ananuri, then at the theological school in Gori, and finally at Tbilisi Seminary.\n\nIn 1880 he graduated from the Kiev Theological Academy and was appointed assistant dean of the Odessa Theological Seminary. From 1883 to 1886 Saint Kirion was active in the educational life of Gori, Telavi, Kutaisi, and Tbilisi. In 1886 he was appointed supervisor of the Georgian monasteries and dean of the schools of the Society for the Renewal of Christianity in the Caucasus. He directed the parochial schools, established libraries and rare book collections within them, and published articles on the history of the Georgian Church, folklore and literature under the pseudonyms Iverieli, Sadzagelov, and Liakhveli (the Liakhvi River flows through his native region of Shida [Inner] Kartli, the central part of eastern Georgia).\n\nIn 1886 God\u2019s chosen, George, was tonsured a monk with the name Kirion, and he was enthroned as abbot of Kvabtakhevi Monastery. Kirion continued his scholarly pursuits and intensified his spiritual labors. He collected folklore and ethnographic materials and studied artifacts from ancient Georgian churches. He generously donated the reliquaries and rare manuscripts he found to the antiquities collections at the Church Museum of Tbilisi and the Society for the Propagation of Literacy among the Georgians.\n\nIn 1898 Kirion published a description of the historical monuments of Liakhvi Gorge. His publication is an important resource for scholars and historians, since most of the monuments he describes were toppled by Georgia\u2019s ideological and national enemies in subsequent years. (Kirion would later join the Moscow Archaeological Society.)\n\nIn August of 1898 Archimandrite Kirion was consecrated bishop of Alaverdi.\n\nSaint Kirion began at once to rebuild Alaverdi Church, and he offered his own resources for this momentous task. At the same time, he began to study the ancient artifacts of Kakheti and Hereti in eastern Georgia. Among the manuscripts he turned over to the Church Museum of Tbilisi was a Holy Gospel from the year 1098, unknown to scholars until that time.\n\nBishop Kirion was a tireless researcher, with a broad range of scholarly interests. To his pen belong more than forty monographs on various themes relating to the history of the Georgian Church and Christian culture in Georgia. He compiled a short terminological dictionary of the ancient Georgian language and, with the linguist Grigol Qipshidze, a History of Georgian Philology.\n\nKirion fought the appropriation of Georgian churches by the Armenian Monophysites. He sent a detailed memorandum to the Russian exarch in Georgia demanding that the confiscated Orthodox churches be returned.\n\nIn 1901 Kirion was installed as bishop of Gori. By that time it had become clear to the Georgian exarchate that the educated and progressive clergymen were endorsing the holy hierarch Kirion and contesting the abolition of the autocephaly of the Georgian Church. But the government found a way out of this \u201cdangerous situation\u201d by frequently reassigning Saint Kirion to serve in different parts of the Russian Empire: in 1903 he was reassigned to Cherson, in 1904 to Orel, and in 1906 to Sokhumi. In Sokhumi Saint Kirion exerted every effort to restore and revive the historical Georgian churches and monasteries, though he would soon be reassigned to the Kovno diocese.\n\nIn 1905, at the demand of Georgia\u2019s intelligentsia (under the leadership of Saint Ilia the Righteous), the regime formed an extraordinary commission to formally consider the question of the autocephaly of the Georgian Church. Saint Kirion delivered two lectures to the commission: one on the reasons behind Georgia\u2019s struggle for the restoration of an autocephalous Church, and the other on the role of nationality in the life of the Church. The commission rejected the Georgian claims to autocephaly and subjected the leaders of the movement to harsh repression.\n\nIn 1907 Saint Ilia the Righteous was killed, and the government forbade Saint Kirion to travel to Georgia to pay his last respects. Saint Kirion managed only to send a letter of condolence to Saint Ilia\u2019s loved ones. In the months that followed, the regime tightened down even more severely on Saint Kirion. In 1908 he was accused of conspiring in the murder of Exarch Nikon, deprived of the rank of bishop, and arrested. This treacherous deed roused the indignation not only of the Georgian people but of the faithful of Russia as well. Even the democratic forces in Europe founded a society for the protection of the rights of Bishop Kirion and gathered signatures to demand his release from prison. The bishop himself humbly carried the cross of his persecution and consoled his sympathizers with the words of the great Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli: \u201c\u2018Not a single rose is plucked from this world without thorns.\u2019 We must bear our suffering with love, since suffering is the fruit of love and in suffering we will find our strength!\u201d\n\nBy the year 1915 the regime had ceased to persecute Saint Kirion. They restored him to the bishopric and elevated him as archbishop of Polotsk and Vitebsk in western Russia. He was not, however, permitted to return to his motherland.\n\nIn March of 1917 the Georgian Apostolic Orthodox Church declared its autocephaly restored. At the incessant demands of the Georgian people, Saint Kirion finally returned to his motherland. One hundred and twenty cavalrymen met him in Aragvi Gorge (along the Georgian Military Highway) and reverently escorted him to the capital. In Tbilisi Saint Kirion was met with great honor.\n\nIn September of 1917 the Holy Synod of the Georgian Orthodox Church enthroned Bishop Kirion as Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. During the enthronement ceremony at Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, Saint Kirion addressed the faithful: \u201cMy beloved motherland, the nation protected by the Most Holy Theotokos, purified in the furnace by tribulations and suffering, washed in its own tears: I turn to you, having been separated from you, having sought after you, having grieved over you, having sought for you and now having returned not as a prodigal son, but as your confidant and the conscience of your Church.\n\n\u201cI know that in your minds you are all inquiring, \u2018What has he brought back with him? With what ointment will he heal his wounds? How will he comfort himself in his sadness?\u2019 Consider my words: He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28). I, likewise, have come not as a hired servant, but as a faithful and obedient son!\u201d\n\nSoon after he was enthroned, Saint Kirion sent an appeal to all the Orthodox patriarchs of the world in which he described in detail the history of the Georgian Church and requested an official recognition of her autocephaly.\n\nOn May 26, 1918, Georgia declared its independence. The next day Catholicos-Patriarch Kirion II presided during a service of thanksgiving. The chief shepherd and his flock rejoiced at the restoration of the autocephaly of the Georgian Church and the independence of the Georgian state, though from the beginning they perceived the imminence of the Bolshevik danger. The socialist revolution, now showing its true face, posed an enormous threat to the young republic and her Church.\n\nOn June 27, 1918, Catholicos-Patriarch Kirion II was found murdered in the patriarchal residence at Martqopi Monastery. The investigation was a mere formality and the guilty were never found.\n\nRumors were even spread that Saint Kirion had shot himself. When the Holy Synod of the Georgian Apostolic Orthodox Church convened on October 17, 2002, it canonized Holy Hieromartyr Kirion and numbered him among the saints.\n\n______________\n\n*Troparion \u2014 Tone 4*\n\nBy sharing in the ways of the Apostles, you became a successor to their throne.

The eternal existential dilemma that anything exists at all!\n\nI've studied physics, philosophy and many major religions for the last 30 years. \n\nI feel that all of them are doing the best job they can of explaining something without human words.

We know now more than we ever have and that's a big help in day to day living, but for the unanswerable - the infinite size of reality, the beginning of time and the universe itself, consciousness... These will always be unanswerable and incomprehensible .\n\nA lot of religions converge on similar ideas. I love the spiritual principles. Love, forgiveness not resentment, honesty, integrity, humility, discipline, hope, action, courage, etc. They really are a guide to living.\n\nHowever, I feel that humans throughout history have abused the spiritual ideas in order to add patriarchal rules, to add us Vs them mentality, and that taken as a whole much of the core has been ruined by human interpretation.\n\nI feel that Buddhism is the closest to a form of real enlightenment.

He then another night, dreamed of what he said was hell, with very wrong picturizations of hell, he described a unimaginably tall tower that was taller than anything he could picture of this world,he said he saw workers with demons overseeing them, he said they had whips but they did not use them, the workers were mining and bringing materials to build the tower, however they were not putting it on the top, there were people holding the tower up, while they added material to the bottom of this tower. He thought that the workers were happy, however could hear distant screaming and torture. Another noticable thing about his experience was that he could hear a creature, which he thought was Satan, screaming and being tortured, held back by something while voices in his head said that they were running out of time and for him to make them more time. It is important to note that the voices in the back of his mind were saying to never give up and there is hope, so I'm wondering if angels were guiding him through this dream or a demon trying to make him think better of hell? He described the hellfire as freezing him and being extremely painful. Underneath the tower, there was cracked ice. His dream ended. Here is where it gets interesting, he had a dream of Adam and Eve, they were caveman like, hairy and hunched over, they gradually started to dissolve over and over, each time getting closer to modern humans, eventually, they combusted and started to scream, turning fully into modern humans, keep in mind my friend has never read the bible. He then saw Eve in a tree and she ate an apple. Instantly, everything faded away and Adam and Eve disappeared. Back to the tower, in his next dream, the tower bursts out of the ground he said they were at heaven, banging on the gates, he heard screaming and war, he mentioned that he was very extremely distressed and punching demons, they did not seem to care. Onto another dream, this guy, I kid you not describes the 7 deadly sins in human form, chained centrally around a pit, in this pit he said he could sense something that is stuck, there is nothing wrong with this except that he heard voices in his head that were saying that they need time, that there is only one thing that is stopping the creature from getting out god himself, he then goes on about how the voices said that they couldn't kill God because they wanted to let this thing out (this is where I think demons are messing with him). Back to the tower and the garden of Eden stuff, he has a dream that the demons are much more mad then when he saw them attacking \"heaven\" This time they were heading strait to him and trying to attack him, he was fighting them with a spiral sword, another noticable thing that relates to the tree in which he saw Eve and the bible verse genesis 3:24, he noticed that the demons were making a path around the tree instead of going by it, when he saw this he tried to go to the tree to escape the demons but he experienced great pain and was stopped from going anywhere near the tree. He then saw the antichrist marching and saying that he will lead everyone to heaven, pretty normal but then he says that there is an entity that appeared that lead all humans to destroy hell and make heaven fall to earth, he then said that all humans were dead and an angel and a demon we're given opposite power, the angel power of destruction and the angel the power of creation. They together formed a place of peace and nothingness at the same time where all humans went, I was wondering if there was any scriptures that I could tell my friend about or any explanations for what he dreamed of, thanks for sticking through this horribly long writing and thanks for any input or scripture. Please pray for my friend.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678684705.0},{"title":"I made a song inspired by Jesus. Dont be too harsh, my singing isnt perfect and english is not my first language.

I'm a bit hesitant about posting here because I'm only just starting my journey in faith - with excitement and joy, but also a lot of anxiety and uncertainty as my wife suffers from an anxiety disorder and religious OCD (scrupulosity), which can make questions of faith extremely challenging.\n\nI'm hoping that you may be able to help with our latest question, which is causing a bit of concern.\n\nBefore this weekend, we had mostly read and studied the bible at home, discussed things together, and joined a few online services. But we have been wanting to find a church community around us so we can connect with like-minded friends and participate in activities with fellow Christians.\n\nHowever, my wife was brought up Adventist. The trouble is that there aren't many SDA churches around us. *(A note: I know some people have a complex relationship with Adventism or have even had negative experiences of this denomination, so it often engenders strong reactions. For the purposes of this post, I hope we can put those aside or at least discuss separately from the main question).* The SDA churches within striking distance of us are small and seem to lack a bit of the community feel that we had hoped to find. We don't necessarily fit in with the congregation.\n\nSo, would you say that it would be appropriate to attend a church of another denomination? That may at least help us to find a Christian community around us, and I know we would agree about far more than we would disagree about. Any specific beliefs in Adventism (like observing a Saturday sabbath, for an obvious example) could be separate - we can do that for ourselves at home.\n\nThanks for your advice and sorry for an ignorant question. To my inexpert eye, it seems good to bond with the local Christian community. But maybe there are more complexities than I realise when it comes to the differences in doctrine and belief.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678650313.0},{"title":"Am i simply doomed to be an unrepentant sinner.

Im going to make a long post about a sin that I\u2019ve been struggling with nearly 11 years and would like some outside perspective or advice. Im 22 and have been struggling with a porn\/ masturbation addiction since I first discovered it when I was 12. The longest ive gone without doing it was when I went to basic training for the Army when I was 18. I didn\u2019t know then the consequences it would cause in my later teens\/adult life and the control it would have over me. I don\u2019t actually watch porn as I find it disgusting but I am addicted to looking at models and instagram girls and what not which in my opinion is essentially the same thing and has the same effect. \n\nThis addiction has become so bad that any opportunity I have alone I end up giving in even if I try talking myself out of it. It has completely warped my mind to the point where I get intrusive thoughts that are so sexualized at times and in my opinion evil that I can\u2019t seem to shut them out. My intrusive thoughts have even perverted images of God and I feel nothing but immense shame. It feels like its not me thinking these things and someone else is planting vile thoughts or images in my head. Years ago I didn\u2019t care about what I was doing enough and thought to myself \u201c I\u2019ll get it together one day \u201c but the last few years I have been trying to take faith more seriously or atleast have been more concerned about it and have been \u201c attempting \u201c to try and make changes but I fail. I hate what I do but I can\u2019t ever seem to consistently stop or control myself. I feel like an animal at times who can\u2019t control its urges. And whenever I do manage to stop doing it for awhile I feel great but eventually resort back to it.\n\nI love God and I do care but I feel I don\u2019t care enough and love my sin more. This particular sin is the worst for me that I struggle with and it dominates my life. Its not to the point where I leave public places or make excuses so I can do it but it persistently tempts me whenever im alone. \n\nTherefore I create this unhealthy cycle where every time I re- lapse I begin to distance myself from God and feel too ashamed to speak to him about anything and especially asking him for forgiveness. Why should I even bother asking to be forgiven if I keep failing and know im going to fail. I feel theres no point and he knows im unwilling to fully commit. Theres times where I can make it a few days or weeks strong but then one day the temptation creeps up on me stronger than the other days and I eventually crack. I know it\u2019s wrong in the moment but I do it anyway and then im back to square one just hating myself for what I do. I feel like I will never be saved at times because I can\u2019t commit to God how I want too. My heart desires him more than anything and I wish I could give him everything I have and he takes all my struggles ( or atleast this one ) away but that unfortunately won\u2019t happen the way I want on Earth. \n\nMy flesh and my mind control me. I have alot of emotional and behavioral issues or struggles that can at times come in to play and contribute to triggering my sin from past experiences or present ones in my life and they put me in a toxic mindset that triggers my addiction. And other times I just straight up think about the sin and give in. I know its not an excuse but I admit I am so weak and I don\u2019t know what to do. Its so easy for me to quickly give in but feels so incredibly hard to follow God in those moments. I end up denying that gut feeling so easily for a few seconds of pleasure and instantly live in regret realizing how easy it could have been to just say no. And then I loose any progress I had.\n\nI recently told my girlfriend and two very close friends about my addiction and all my secrets I have hidden for years but I still am resorting to my sexual sins. I paid for 2 apps that web and social media app blockers but I always slip through the cracks and find something to trigger myself or choose not to control my thoughts or the temptation. I had a solid 2 weeks recently of praying, reading the bible and asking God for help and forgiveness until one day like I stated before I cracked and gave in. My thoughts tell me that its wrong in the moment and to turn back before its too late but eventually the temptation overcomes me and wins every time. Because of my bad habits I often question myself and become depressed and angry with myself. I feel disconnected from God because of my own doing and I end up just sinning in other ways because of it and enter a depressed, angry, and unmotivated mood.\n\nI have many other issues that need to be resolved but this is the main struggle followed by anger that at this point I am so lost and feel like I will never succeed any time soon. Yet somehow in a way God seems so far away but so close at the same time. I just wish I could hold on to him more in my moments of temptation. My faith therefore is weak.\n\nI hope I make sense and others can understand. God bless you all.

This question could possibly be asked by those who follow a prosperity gospel that preaches wealth and material blessings as the reward for having faith in God. Contemplating following Jesus based solely on what benefits may come from it isn't looking at following Him in the right light. We should approach Jesus knowing that the best thing that will come from doing so is, in fact, Jesus Himself and a relationship with God the Father. In following Him, we are giving Lordship over our lives to the One who loved each one of us enough to take our sins upon Himself and die for us on the cross ( Is. 53:5, John 15:13, Rom. 5:8, Gal. 2:20 ). By surrendering to Him, we gain the One who loves us more than any other person in the world ever could. Through His love and His sacrifice, we receive salvation from our sins and eternal life where we will spend eternity with Him and God ( John 3:16; 14:1-3, Rom. 6:23 ). Choosing whether to accept or reject Jesus isn't a trivial matter. It's important to remember that there are consequences for those who reject Him. Those who reject Jesus are under God's wrath ( John 3:36 ), don't receive forgiveness for their sins, and will be punished for their sins with eternal punishment in the lake of fire ( Rev. 20:11-15 ). There is no way around this except through having that personal relationship with Christ ( John 14:6 ).\n\n\n\n*Q:* *When have you been tempted to go to God only seeking to receive something from Him?* \n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n***God, thank You for the life that is in Your Son, Jesus Christ, and thank You for making salvation available to us through Him. Help us to seek You for You, God, and give us the desire to know You more. Help us not to go to You only seeking to receive, but to seek You out of love for You. Thank You for Your goodness.***\n\n***In Jesus's Name, I pray, amen.***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like this devotional, you can subscribe to my blog site where I post new devotionals every Sunday and Tuesday!\n\nhttps:\/\/counselingchristians.wixsite.com\/counseling-christian","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678661553.0},{"title":"A Christian Tradition","author":"HauntingSentence6359","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11pmgno\/a_christian_tradition\/","text":"Christian tradition is that Mary rode Joseph\u2019s donkey from Nazareth to Bethlehem for the Roman census.

It not only attests to Jesus Christ by the specific witness of antiquity, such as Josephus, Philo, Justin Martyr, Pliny the Younger, Tacitus, the heretical Gnostic gospels & the Scriptures themselves, it was also preserved in the church as we see in the early Church. Some who were disciples of the apostles, whose writings we still have to this day to attest to the validity of the Scriptures & the truthfulness of them, by witness of their own lives, namely Polycarp, Ignatius & Clement of Rome, the former 2 martyred on account of the testimony of Christ, one burned to death & the other fed to lions. Yet the Church maintained a consistency of faith & what has been passed down as the Truth, the very teachings of Jesus Christ & the Apostles, with writings about how they were written.\n\nFor example, church historian Eusebius of Caesarea in the 4th century, recounting earlier testimony regarding the witness of the Gospel accounts, her says;\n\n\u201cAnd they say that Peter \u2014 when he had learned, through a revelation of the Spirit, of that which had been done \u2014 was pleased with the zeal of the men, and that the work obtained the sanction of his authority for the purpose of being used in the churches. Clement in the eighth book of his Hypotyposes gives this account, and with him agrees the bishop of Hierapolis named Papias. And Peter makes mention of Mark in his first epistle which they say that he wrote in\nRome itself, as is indicated by him, when he calls the city, by a figure, Babylon, as he does in the following words: The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.\u201d\n\nExcerpt From\nThe History of the Church\nEusebius\n\nWhat I am saying all this to say is that Church history has strengthened my faith & continues the story of God\u2019s people, who;\n\u201c\u2026having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord,\u201d\n\u202d\u202dEphesians\u202c \u202d2\u202c:\u202d19\u202c-\u202d21\u202c \u202d\n\nWe still exist & the apostolic faith still remains as is made clear by our recitation of the Nicene Creed, a creed which so clearly shows our timeless doctrine & what has been preserved as the truth which conquered the world.\n\nAnd truly, the love of Jesus Christ will continue to conquer & His Church will remain for all ages, to the praise of our Glorious Savior & Mighty King.\n\n Psalm 2:7-9\n\n    [7] I will tell of the decree:\n    The LORD said to me, \u201cYou are my Son;\n        today I have begotten you. \n    [8] Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,\n        and the ends of the earth your possession. \n    [9] You shall break them with a rod of iron\n        and dash them in pieces like a potter\u2019s vessel.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678667959.0},{"title":"Christian and Catholic","author":"CharacterGuava6723","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11puzlp\/christian_and_catholic\/","text":"How come every time I ask someone if they're a christian, a lot of them answer saying they're catholic?

However I have serious problems with his methodology in that he falls into the exact stereotypes that religious conservatives have of some forms of progressive Christianity: \n\n1)He says he doesn't believe the Bible is the inspired word of God\n\n2)He says he does not believe in objective morality and that his morality is subjective. Now if you're operating in another paradigm and you say that that's fine. But saying you're a Christian and then a minister and also claiming that you reject objective standards of morals is just a fundamental rejection of classical Christianity. \n\n3)He has a relativistic approach to truth. Relativism is the exactly opposite of what historic Christianity teaches as well as the biblical understanding of truth. \n\n4)He makes statements such as \"Jesus was wrong\" and \"Jesus was a racist\" and things of that nature. Now if you're critical of Jesus and you're operating outside of a Christian perspective(whether its Jewish, Atheist, Buddhist, Hindu, etc) that makes sense. You don't believe in Christ to begin with. But to say you are a Christian and a Christian minister and then to claim things like Jesus was wrong or Jesus was a \"racist\" is just inconsistent. Especially if one of the tenets of Christianity is that Christ is the son of god and the saviour of the world. \n\nMy perspective is that while I understand his intentions, his approach to the faith represents I think the problems with many expressions of what is called \"progressive Christianity\" or \"liberal Christianity\" with its relativistic, subjectivist approach to things.

Papal and theological precedents in defending the rights of indigenous peoples","author":"Anglicanpolitics123","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11peehh\/pope_francis_is_saying_nothing_newpart_1_papal\/","text":"I thought I would do a series of posts called \"Pope Francis is saying nothing new\". The reason being is that often times there is a significant amount of confusion in terms of Pope Francis's beliefs and perspectives. People think that he is either \"changing the Catholic Church's teachings\" or that he's just trying to \"give the appearance of being progressive\" to fit a modern age. Both are false. He sees himself as building off previous social teachings that have already been there, particularly social justice teachings. What I'm going to do in these series of posts is first post quotes that show the precedents in Catholic and Christian history that the Pope is drawing from. Then I will compare these with quotes from the Pope himself. The first focus of this discussion is going to be on the rights of indigenous peoples. This got a lot of attention in the global and North American press due to Canadian residential schools, the genocidal impact there. Many saw this as a \"new and ground breaking\" moment that was unprecedented. As will be shown though, that is true and not true. Because there is precedent in the history of the Catholic Church for defending the rights of indigenous peoples:\n\n**Papal and theological precedent:**\n\n* \"*I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. In order to make your sins known to you I have mounted this pulpit, I who am the voice of Christ crying in the wilderness of this island; and therefore it behooves you to listen to me, not with indifference but with all your heart and senses; for this voice will be the strangest, the harshest and hardest, the most terrifying that you ever heard or expected to hear\u2026.This voice declares that you are in mortal sin, and live and die therein by reason of the cruelty and tyranny that you practice on these innocent people. Tell me, by what right or justice do you hold these indigenous people in such cruel and horrible slavery? By what right do you wage such detestable wars on these people who lived mildly and peacefully in their own lands, where you have consumed infinite numbers of them with unheard of murders and desolations? Why do you so greatly oppress and fatigue them, not giving them enough to eat or caring for them when they fall ill from excessive labors, so that they die or rather are slain by you, so that you may extract and acquire gold every day*?\"\\_Fr Antonio De Montesinos(Advent Sermon, 1511)\n* \"*The reader may ask himself if this is not cruelty and injustice of a kind so terrible that it beggars the imagination, and whether these poor*\\*(indigenous)\\* *people would not fare far better if they were entrusted to the devils in Hell than they do at the hands of the devils of the New World who masquerade as Christians*\"\\_Fr Bartolome De Las Casas(On the Destruction of the Indies, 1542)\n* \u201c*I leave in the Indies Jesus Christ, our God, scourged and afflicted and beaten and crucified not once, but thousands of times*.\"\\_Fr Bartolome De Las Casas(History of the Indies, 1566)\n* \"*The enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to bring men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God\u2019s word of Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the indigenous people of the West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service....Desiring to provide ample remedy for these evils, We define and declare by these Our letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, to which the same credit shall be given as to the originals, that, notwithstanding whatever may have been or may be said to the contrary, the said indigenous people and all other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith of Jesus Christ; and that they may and should, freely and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of their property; nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null and have no effect*.\"\\_Pope Paul III(Sublimus Dei, 1537)\n* \"*It is asked: Whether it is permitted to capture by force and deceit Blacks and other indigenous people who have harmed no one? Answer: no. Whether it is permitted to buy, sell or make contracts in their respect Blacks and other indigenous people who have harmed no one and been made captives by force or deceit? Answer: no. Whether the possessors of Blacks and other indigenous people who have harmed no one and been captured by force or deceit, are not held to set them free? Answer: yes. Whether the captors, buyers and possessors of Blacks and other indigenous people who have harmed no one and who have been captured by force or deceit are not held to make compensation to them? Answer: yes*.\"\\_Congregation of the Holy Office(1686)\n* \"*\\[We condemn and declare guilty of grave crime whosoever\\] shall dare or presume to reduce the said Indigenous people to slavery, to sell them, to buy them, to exchange or give them, to separate them from their wives and children, to deprive them of goods and chattels, to transport or send them to other places, or in any way whatsoever to rob them of freedom and hold them in slavery; or to give counsel, help, favor, and work on any pretext of color to them that do these things, or to preach or teach that it is lawful, or to co-operate therewith in any way whatever*.\"\\_Pope Benedict XIV(Immensa Pastorum, 1741)\n* \"*Though much has thus been done for the Indians, there is much more that still remains to be done. And, indeed, when we consider the crimes and outrages still committed against them, our heart is filled with horror, and we are moved to great compassion for its most unhappy race. For what can be so cruel and so barbarous as to scourge men and brand them with hot iron, often for most trivial causes, often for a mere lust of cruelty; or, having suddenly overthrown them, to slay hundreds or thousands in one unceasing massacre; or to waste villages and districts and slaughter the inhabitants, so that some tribes, as we understand, have become extinct in these last few years? The lust of lucre has done much to make the minds of men so barbarous. But something also is due to the nature of the climate and the situation of these regions. For, as these places are subjected to burning southern sun, which casts a languor into the veins and as it were, destroys the vigor of virtue, and as they are far removed from the habits of religion and the vigilance of the State, and in a measure even from civil society, it easily comes to pass that those who have not already come there with evil morals soon begin to be corrupted, and then, when all bonds of right and duty are broken, they fall away into all hateful vices. Nor in this do they take any pity on the weakness of sex or age, so that we are ashamed to mention the crimes and outrages they commit in seeking out and selling women and children, wherein it may be truly said that they have surpassed the worst examples of pagan iniquity*.\"\\_Pope Pius X(Lacrimabili Statu, 1912)\n* \"*We particularly urge you to foster and promote all the good works instituted in your dioceses for the benefit of the indigenous people, and to see that other works likely to contribute to this end may be instituted....Do you, moreover, take care that wheresoever moral instruction is given, in seminaries, in colleges, in convent schools, and more especially in the churches, Christian charity, which holds all men, without distinction of nation or color, as true brethren, shall be continually preached and commended. And this charity must be made manifest not so much by words as by deeds. Moreover, every opportunity must be taken to show what a great dishonor is done to the Christian name by these base deeds, which we are here denouncing*\"\\_Pope Pius X(Lacrimabili Statu, 1912)\n\nSo this is the theological and Papal precedence for the defense of the rights of indigenous communities. I could have drawn from many other sources but that would make this OP far too long. Suffice to say when it comes to the Catholic Church's relationship with indigenous peoples since 1492 there has always been what I consider to be two tracks(this could apply to Christian Churches in general). Track 1 is what I call the \"imperial track\". Basically an imperial and domineering approach to Christianity that sought to subjugate indigenous people and erase their culture. The roots of this are in the Doctrine of Discovery, the \"spiritual conquest of indigenous people\", residential schools and other abuses. Then there is the \"prophetic track\". This track resists the exploitation and oppression of indigenous communities. We see this in figures like Las Casas, Pope Paul III, Pope Pius X and the Latin American theologians of the modern era who played prominent roles in resisting genocidal policies in places like Guatemala during the civil war and Peru in the 90s. Both have existed side by side for 500 there. Francis has taken the prophet tract as his precedent. These are his perspectives in quotes: \n\n* \"*Indigenous peoples for example are not opposed to progress, yet theirs is a different notion of progress, often more humanistic than the modern culture of developed peoples. Theirs is not a culture meant to benefit the powerful, those driven to create for themselves a kind of earthly paradise. Intolerance and lack of respect for indigenous popular cultures is a form of violence grounded in a cold and judgemental way of viewing them. No authentic, profound and enduring change is possible unless it starts from the different cultures, particularly those of the poor*\"(Fratelli Tuti, prg 220) \n* \"*It is essential to show special for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions. They are not merely one minority among others but should be the principal dialogue partners, especially when large projects affecting their land are proposed. For them, land is not a commodity but rather a gift from God and from their ancestors who rest there, a sacred space with which they need to interact if they are to maintain their identity and values. When they remain on their land, they themselves care for it best. Nevertheless in various parts of the world, the pressure is being put on them to abandon their homelands to make room for agricultural or mining projects which are undertaken without regard for the degradation of nature and culture*\"(Laudato Si, prg 146) \n* \"*We need to feel outrage as Moses did(Ex 11:8) and as Jesus did(Mk 3:5) as God does in the face of injustice(Am 2:4-8; 5:7-12; Ps 106:40). It is not good for us to become inured to evil; it is not good when our social consciousness is dulled before and exploitation that is leaving destruction throughout our region....jeopardizing the lives of millions of people and especially the habitat of peasants and indigenous peoples. The incidents of injustice and cruelty that took place in the Amazon region even in the last century ought to provoke profound abhorrence, but they should also make us more sensitive to the need to acknowledge current forms of human exploitation, abuse and killing*\"(Querida Amazonia, prg 15) \n* \"*The businesses, national, or international which harm the Amazon and fail to respect the right of the indigenous peoples to the land and its boundaries, and to self determination and prior consent should be called for what they are: injustice and crime. When certain businesses out for quit profit appropriate land and end up privatizing even potable water, or when local authorities give free access to the timber companies, mining or oil projects, and other businesses that raze the forests and pollute the environment, economic relationships are unduly altered and become and instrument of death*\"(Querida Amazonia, prg 14) \n* \"*I would like to point out that a consumerist vision of human beings, encouraged by the mechanisms of today's globalized economy, have a leveling effect on cultures, diminishing the immense variety which is the heritage of all humanity. This especially affects young people, for it has a tendency to blur what is distinctive about their origins and backgrounds and turn them into a new line of malleable goods....I urge the young people of the Amazon region, especially indigenous peoples, to take charge of your roots, because from the roots comes the strength that will make you grow, flourish and bear fruit*\"(Querida Amazonia, prg 33)\n* \"*Let us say NO, then, to forms of colonialism old and new. Let us say YES to the encounter between peoples and cultures. Blessed are the peacemakers. Here I wish to bring up an important issue. Some may rightly say, \u201cWhen the Pope speaks of colonialism, he overlooks certain actions of the Church\u201d. I say this to you with regret: many grave sins were committed against the native peoples of America in the name of God...I ask that the Church...kneel before God and implore forgiveness for the past and present sins of her sons and daughters\u201d..I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offenses of the Church herself, but also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America. Together with this request for forgiveness and in order to be just, I also would like us to remember the thousands of priests and bishops who strongly opposed the logic of the sword with the power of the Cross. There was sin, a great deal of it, for which we did not ask pardon. So for this, we ask forgiveness, I ask forgiveness. But here also, where there was sin, great sin, grace abounded through the men and women who defended the rights of indigenous peoples*\"(World Meeting of Popular Movements, 2015) \n* \"*At this time in Latin America and the Caribbean, the so often silenced cry of women who are subjected to many forms of exclusion and violence in all their forms and at all stages of their lives must be heard. Among them, poor, indigenous and Afro-American women have endured double marginalization. All women must be able to participate fully in ecclesial, family, cultural, social, and economic life, with the creation of spaces and structures to foster greater inclusion*\"(Aparecida Conference, prg 454) \n* \"*Today, more than ever, there are many who demand a process of reconversion of the consolidated power structures that underpin the societies of western culture; these, at the same time, transform the historical relations marked by colonialism, exclusion and discrimination, giving rise to a renewed dialogue on the way in which we are building our future on the planet. We urgently need joint action, the fruit of sincere and constant collaboration, because the environmental challenge we are experiencing and its human roots have an impact on every one of us. Not only a physical impact, but also psychological and cultural. Therefore, I ask governments to recognize the Indigenous Peoples of the whole world, with their cultures, languages, traditions and spirituality, and to respect their dignity and their rights, in the knowledge that the richness of our great human family consists precisely in its diversity.  Ignoring Indigenous communities in protecting the earth is a grave error \u2014 it is extractive functionalism \u2014 not to mention a great injustice....Aboriginal cultures are not there to be transformed into a modern culture, no. They are there to be respected. \\[We must consider\\] two things: firstly, letting them follow their path of development and, secondly, listening to the messages of wisdom they give us. Because it is not an encyclopaedic wisdom. It is the wisdom of seeing, listening to and touching daily life. Continue to fight to proclaim this harmony, because this functionalist policy, this policy of extractivism, is destroying it. And may we all be able to learn from this living well in the harmonious sense of Indigenous Peoples*.\"(To Participants in Indigenous Peoples Forum, 2023)","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678627235.0},{"title":"Stop feeling sorry for yourself","author":"tye-a-pink-zebra","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11pstcx\/stop_feeling_sorry_for_yourself\/","text":"I don\u2019t know if this is a Christian message but it\u2019s certainly one that I believe will help people (which could certainly fit in with Matthew 19:19). \n\nI\u2019m only 18 but I\u2019ve had some hard stuff happen to me in the past, which still affects me to this day.

I like the church structure of Catholicism but not all the beliefs. Any ideas?\n\nBackground:\n\nI want to find a church to go to but don\u2019t know where to start and I feel overwhelmed by all the denominations in Protestantism. Classic story, I was raised Catholic by not very devout parents, went to Catholic schools, fell away from God in my teens and was called back to Christ a couple years ago (considered Islam first but I didn\u2019t find it to be the truth after about a year of looking into it, which I won\u2019t get into here). I am still trying to figure out where I belong within Christianity. I would be Catholic and I have a lot of love for the Catholic Church but I don\u2019t agree with all the fundamental teachings. I don\u2019t want to just be Catholic because it\u2019s familiar and has a lot of family\/childhood memories and I like the mass.\n\nBeliefs:\n\n-salvation by faith alone (evidenced by works)\n\n-don\u2019t believe in transubstantiation. I have had emotional experiences while taking Eucharist, but I\u2019m not sure if this is because it literally is Jesus or my emotional connection with the symbolism of taking communion. Reading the Bible verses on the last supper within the context of the Jewish Passover it seems much more likely it was metaphorical\/ symbolic. \n\n-no gay marriage or abortion\n\n-I like church hierarchy and the checks and balances it provides (preventing situations like the drink-the-koolaid guy, new age stuff, and weird interpretations of the Bible). I have concerns about the freedom some evangelical pastors seem to have to just say whatever (granted priests sometimes do this too but they can be shut down pretty fast with authority)\n\n-on the fence about whether priests should be married. On one hand marriage takes away attention from their duty to the church and leaves more room for biased teachings on marriage\/ gender relations but on the other hand marriage could prevent inappropriate\/immoral sexual behavior and give priests a better understanding of the lives of the congregation. It could solve the priest shortage but maybe not in a good way. More people would become pastors and not all of them would be really dedicated if they weren\u2019t willing to give up family life for the role \n\n-I don\u2019t think women should be priests or pastors (but I haven\u2019t really looked into this that much, could change my mind with good evidence\/ analysis)\n\n-no divorce except in cases of adultery. I also think it\u2019s ok to divorce when there is abuse but am not sure about remarriage in that case. (I do think it\u2019s ok to get away from someone when they want to hurt you and I think the Bible supports this). To be honest I don\u2019t know that much about the Catholic responses to adultery\/abuse\u2026 would annulment be an option there? Or just no remarriage?\n\n-love the religious life in Catholic Church\u2014nuns, brothers, etc. I think it\u2019s great (I don\u2019t feel called to it but I thought about it as a kid because I knew lots of great brothers\/sisters)\n\n-I like church tradition\/ritual so long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with keeping the focus on deepening your relationship with God. Ritual can help bring you into prayer-mode but it can also distract from the purpose.\n\n-I have admiration for Mary and I think she\u2019s a great example for all Christians,  both men and women, but I also think praying to her or saints is at minimum unnecessary (I don\u2019t agree that you go through her to Jesus) and at most idolatry depending on how it\u2019s done. Since it\u2019s unnecessary why would you risk potentially getting into idolatry territory? I have heard a million times from Catholic family and friends how they prayed to Mary and X good thing happened to them and I just think this is a dangerous train of thought\/superstition to get into. I used to pray the rosary and it felt good but more in the way that just meditating feels good\/ calms your mind. I only really feel closer to Jesus when I pray to him directly. \n\n-whether Jesus did or didn\u2019t have siblings doesn\u2019t seem important to me. Neither does whether or not Mary remained a virgin. \n\n-I believe in traditional gender roles (St John Chrysostom\u2019s homily 20 on Ephesians)\n\n-I like reading church fathers and historical theologians (who were mostly Catholic) and writings of the \u201csaints\u201d (I don\u2019t know that any person has the right to say who is or isn\u2019t a saint but you know who I mean)\n\n-I see water baptism as symbolic and ok for babies or adults.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678646369.0},{"title":"Can one claim that God is good even with verses that indicate he can kill all of us including children at will and whenever he thinks we deserve to die?","author":"FlushedButterfly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11pdkjz\/can_one_claim_that_god_is_good_even_with_verses\/","text":"Even if he plans to just kill people, why not leave the children or innocent ones out there, that appears to happen, God punishes everyone for the sin someone else did when he's all powerful, he must definitely have other options.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678624646.0},{"title":"Seeking Guidance \u2013 Seriously dating a devout Christian as a nonbeliever","author":"JackfruitTerrible290","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11prkmb\/seeking_guidance_seriously_dating_a_devout\/","text":"Hi all, \n\nDropping in here to ask for your help and advice. \n\nI (30M) have dated my girlfriend (29F) for 3 years, and we are very much in love.

My general understanding is that when you die you\u2019re back in the same nothingness similar to before you were born. I mean all of my questions and beliefs in full respect, i want everyone to live their lives in whatever allows them to be happy. That being said\u2026\n\n\nOne: Do most Christians or just you in general, actually believe what is taught to you  in church? And same goes for anything you would read in the bible. 3 years ago i read through many religious texts including the Bible (im a history teacher so i felt they were history worth learning) and after reading the Bible i was rather shocked at how ludicrous it was. In my personal opinion it was like reading a children\u2019s book, nothing seemed believable. \n\n\nTwo: As someone who graduated with a masters in history, it seems likely that religion was made up out of confusion. Religion to me, seems like it was only ever made to explain everything that would happen in the world. However i cant quite wrap my head around why, in the modern age, people still believe in things that can be disproved my science. What first comes to mind is people believing that natural disasters are a consequence of large groups not doing what god wants. However we now have the technology to explain natural disasters yet as far as i know, some still believe it is a disproved god. So why is christianity still around?\n\n\nThree: I mentioned the hard core stoner part. Why is marijuana so frowned upon in religion? In gen 1:12 it states hemp can be used for food, medicine and enjoyment. Yet the name \u201cdevils lettuce\u201d originates from christianity (please correct me if thats wrong).

We\u2019ve known each other through high school, really liked each other, and somehow ended up back together.\n\nI\u2019m newly an ex-Mormon. I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t think the church is true, it\u2019s a cult, and that I don\u2019t believe in Joseph Smith and their prophets. I also believe in the Holy Trinity which goes directly against Mormonism.\n\nMy boyfriend is Christian. He goes to his college church, attends two activities a week on top of that, and is pretty serious about it. His mom is a leader at their church in our hometown. He has one-on-ones with his group leader, and they obviously talk about me because I\u2019m going through a religious journey.\n\nI believe in God and Christ, I pray every day, I believe in the teachings and lessons in the Bible, but I\u2019m not sure if I qualify as a Christian. I\u2019m just very confused about when I\u2019m allowed to call myself thaf because in Mormonism your membership is a title that needs to be earned. \n\nAs I said, my bf has one-on-ones. His leader said he thinks we should break up because this relationship will be a factor in my religion. I should choose God because of me, not because my bf wants that of me.\n\nI get the sentiment, but I just feel like it implies that I haven\u2019t already chosen God. \ud83d\ude05 It feels counterintuitive for the person inspiring me to leave me in order to keep inspiring me. I\u2019ve loved dating him because he\u2019s the first bf I\u2019ve had that didn\u2019t push religion onto me. Mormonism varies from Christianity in lots of ways, but I believed (and still believe) in God. I had a relationship with him before. I was able to take a step away from Mormonism because of my bf. I finally felt safe enough to leave. It\u2019s because of him and his mom that I\u2019m able to explore religion and ask questions. Lots of people date members of a particular church and convert. He\u2019s scared he\u2019s pressuring me into Christianity, and now I feel like I can\u2019t choose God without it being perceived as for him even though I know it isn\u2019t. I felt like his leader and him set me up to appear that way UNLESS we break up. \n\nMy bf doesn\u2019t think we should break up, but obviously anyone you admire telling you that you should is going to mess you up for a bit. \n\nWe talked last night about it and agreed that when I attend his college next year we\u2019d try to go to church together. I want to go to church again and when I\u2019ve visited on weekends, I\u2019ve enjoyed the group he goes to. I didn\u2019t feel stressed going to bed last night, but now I\u2019m all stressed about it again. I just feel like there are a lot of expectations on what I should be doing in terms of my relationship with God, and that\u2019s exactly why I left the Mormon church.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and it\u2019s been weighing on my mind. He doesn\u2019t know what the right thing to do is because obviously my relationship with God is more important than my relationship with him. I just don\u2019t understand how those things can\u2019t coexist. \n\nBreaking up so I can figure things out is just confusing. I don\u2019t know what there is to figure out.

I feel separated from the get go from other Christians. \n\nI\u2019ve prayed about it and I\u2019m into sure. \n\nI don\u2019t know. What should we do? Is it a good idea to break up?

Possibly, it more correctly arose in \u201cthe second place.\u201d\n\nChristianity for the first few hundred years existed for the most part, in the Roman Empire, the writings and teaching interpreted by people in terms of their\n\noverriding cultural influence.\n\n>**The classic, if not earliest, conception of hell, of the afterlife generally, resembles nothing so much as the Roman conception of Hades.** Hades wasn\u2019t hell, it was the place all people went to live after death and it comprised a variety of \u201clands.\u201d You ended up in one or another depending on what kind of person you were in life. Remember what we call Roman \u201cmythology\u201d wasn\u2019t mythical to them, this was their religion and they had a well-developed and ancient set of beliefs.\n\nThe Romans believed all afterlife was underground and in Hades the dead live in a counterpart of material, earthly existence. The righteous live without pain or problem in the Elysian Fields, ruled by the god Cronos in peace and everlasting light. (also underground). There is \u201cHades in general\u201d where most of us will stay. But the wicked are tormented in Tartarus, (also the name of the god who rules there) a deep, sunless abyss.\n\n>**Tartarus is probably the only word reasonably translated \u201chell\u201d in the New Testament. Used only once in Scripture, in the form of a verb tartaroo tartarow (Strong\u2019s 5020) in 2 Peter 2:4. From the KJV: \u201cFor if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them to chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; \u2026\u201d**\n\nIt sounds very much like a sentence written by someone who believed in the Roman version of afterlife which sounds like a Christian version of \"hell.\"\n\n# If what Jesus said in Greek is reported accurately in Scripture, and if we are still operating under a very old mistranslation of what He said, then just what did He say?\n\n>Consequences after death for actions in life was something Jesus often spoke of, and he very often used the analogy of Gehenna, a valley south of Jerusalem where refuse and dead animals were dumped and burned.  \\[SN 1067 **gehenna** \\- Gehenna, the Valley of the son of Hinnom, south of Jerusalem, a waste dump and place of \u201ceternal\u201d fires, misery and banishment. **If translated, usually translated as \u201chell.\u201d**\\]\n\nHowever, you rarely find a translation of Scripture (the New American Bible is a notable exception) where the translator has used \u201cGehenna,\u201d **the actual place name Jesus used in His analogies.** Instead, almost all English translations, Bibles have substituted \u201chell.\u201d And English word. A language that didn't exist 2000 years ago.\n\nIf we reinsert *Gehenna*, what can we understand Jesus to have told us?\n\nHistorically, Gehenna was the site of a pagan shrine where human sacrifice was practiced and it was cursed by Jeremiah. By Jesus\u2019 time, it was so long an enormous trash dump, that the fires burning there had burned for decades, the fire smoldering deep under great piles of refuse. And so we have Jesus\u2019 reference to the \u201cunquenchable fire\u201d in Mark 9:43.\n\n>Because the Sheol of the Hebrews had long been described as an **underground world of darkness**, \\[similar to the Roman Tartarus) it is easy to see how they made the connection to descending into a valley continually shrouded in clouds of smoke and ash that kept in it a kind of \u201ceternal\u201d darkness. Those who frequented Gehenna were the unclean, the criminals and the mentally ill, ejected by society, identified as suffering for their sins in life.  \n>  \n>In Matthew 8:12 Jesus is quoted as speaking of some being \u201cdriven out into the outer darkness where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\u201d\n\nAway from Jerusalem in the darkness of that valley, there must have been much wailing.\n\n**Gehenna** represented the worst possible outcome of one\u2019s life, hopelessness and suffering, darkness and filth, rejection and isolation.\n\n**It was less the place that was the analogy for where some may end up after death, than it was** ***the state of being*** **of those that were sent there, being separated from other people and from what was holy**.\n\nIf you were a leper you could be relegated to Gehenna, to eat of unclean things in the smoky stench until you were cleansed of your disease. If you were a criminal, you might hide there forever, as in your whole life, unless you were forgiven or your debt paid somehow. The people in Gehenna were even outcast from one another, the criminal afraid of being contaminated by the leper, the leper afraid of being robbed or murdered, both afraid of the psychotic, often thought to be possessed by demons.\n\n>So, for one in Gehenna, being able to go to Jerusalem to live, to worship in the Temple and be restored to society is a very good analogy for heaven, for this is all such a person could desire. To be made clean, healed, forgiven and to clear his debt. To be reconciled to God and to the people, the ecclesia.\n\nBeing outcast in a place of darkness and eternal fire and unholy things became the punishment, instead of the thing that sent you there, the leprosy or the madness, so punishment moved from something that happened to you in this life \\[as the Jews believed\\] to something that happened after death. \\[As the Romans believed.\\]\n\n>**And because so many who were banished to the actual Gehenna died there, the idea came about that one could go to a place after death of never ending torment, as the torment of those in Gehenna lasted their whole lives. Soon, death\/Sheol\/\/Gehenna became interchangeable terms and conflated concepts, translated into English as hell.**\n\nJesus never said the word \"hell\" - He never said we'd be tortured for eternity. He never said any of it.  Rejoice.

Satan wants us to live comfortably in sin, being distracted and allured by technology and entertainment. He wants us to \u201cjust live a little\u201d and accept sin, so we create an entry point for him to cause us to sin more. **Who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth? This persuasion comes not of Him that calls you. A little leaven leavens the whole lump** (Galatians 5:7-9). If we accept a little sin in our lives, it will inevitably become more sin. This is why it\u2019s so important to **bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ** (2 Cor. 10:5). We must be attentive to all of our thoughts, so we can reject the false sinful ones inspired by Satan and prevent sin from spreading. We need to be on fire for the LORD, **not lukewarm** (Revelation 3:16) Being lukewarm is going to invite some sin, which is going to generate more sin.\n\n**For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.** (Ephesians 2:8-9)\n\nThe verse above is often misconstrued and used as an excuse to live comfortably in sin. The false \u201conce saved always saved\u201d doctrine deceives people into believing they can sin willfully without being judged by God. The truth is, to be saved, we must have a full desire and use full effort to depart from sin and become more righteous. This is not to say we won\u2019t make mistakes on our journey. What\u2019s important is having a full desire and giving full effort for righteousness. When we reject worldly desires and set our desire straight with the LORD, He always helps us make progress in holiness.\n\n**But by the grace of God I am what I am: and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.** (1 Corinthians 15:10)\n\n**Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.** (1 Corinthians 10:34)\n\n**Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.** (1 Corinthians 15:58)\n\nThe three verses above make it clear, we need to work to stop sinning and become righteous. The key is understanding that our \u201cwork\u201d is not actually ours, but God\u2019s. Hence why no one should boast for their work. It is only through God\u2019s grace that we are able to work. Our job is to FOCUS our minds on God, reject the world\u2019s distractions, and become unceasing in prayer, Bible study and meditation. When we do this, our desire is set straight on God. When our desire is right on God, he gives us the strength to depart from sin and work for Him. It is God\u2019s work, but our EFFORT is required.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678639569.0},{"title":"Seeing advice on a situation as to how to advise a friend...","author":"desaderal","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11pfwvj\/seeing_advice_on_a_situation_as_to_how_to_advise\/","text":"So, my friend is dating a girl and he was invited to skiing event that would not include her.

Before you ask, I have checked the original languages, using a concordance as necessary, but still find it difficult to reconcile these passages. Please let me know what your take is. \n\n# Bible Verses\n\n######[Genesis 1:27](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=KJV)\n\n> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created **he him**; male and female created he them.\n\nWhy not just use \"he them\" for both clauses instead of \"he him\" if that's what was intended? \n\n######[Genesis 5:1-2](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Genesis%205%3A1-2&version=KJV)\n\n> This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made **he him**; Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.\n\nSame as the previous.\n\n######[Ezekiel 1:26](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Ezekiel+1%3A26&version=KJV)\n\n> And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the **appearance of a man** above upon it.\n\nThe Lord sitting on his throne is described as having the appearance of a man in Ezekiel's visions.\n\n######[Job 1:6](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Job+1%3A6&version=KJV)\n\n>Now there was a day when the **sons of God** came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.\n\nShouldn't there be women in heaven or at least some kind of feminine entity but there are only references to \"sons\" of God?\n\n######[1 Corinthians 11:7-9](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A7-9&version=KJV)\n\n> For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as **he is the image and glory of God**: but **the woman is the glory of the man**. For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.\n\nProbably the most direct answer to my post's question.\n\n######[Philippians 2:7](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Philippians%202%3A7&version=KJV)\n\n>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, **and was made in the likeness of men**:\n\nJesus Christ Himself took upon the form of a man.\n\n######[Ephesians 5:23](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Ephesians+5%3A23&version=KJV)\n\n> For the **husband** is the head of the wife, even as **Christ** is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\n\nIn the context of marriage, men are compared to God (Jesus Christ), not women.\n\n[Genesis 2:7](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Genesis+2%3A7&version=KJV), [Genesis 2:15](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Genesis+2%3A15&version=KJV), & [Genesis 2:18](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Genesis+2%3A18&version=KJV)\n\n>7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n\n>15 And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\n\n>18 And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.\n\nGod created man first and then woman to minister unto his aloneness as well as be his helper.\n\n######[Galatians 3:28](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Galatians%203%3A28&version=KJV)\n\n> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\n\nThis verse seems to initially support the idea that women are equal with men but this seems to be only in terms of salvation (based on the context) and not image if you read the full chapter, at least according to my understanding. I may be wrong.\n\n#Quotes from Past Christians\n\nMost curiously, I wonder how Christians from past ages would've answered this question because I know the interpretations change with the times even though that shouldn't be the case because God's Word in the Bible is static. I was able to find a few quotes. These quotes may or may not be uncomfortable to read for many, so I'd like to make a preemptive disclaimer that no negativity or ill will is intended in highlighting them. I only wish to find the biblical answer.\n\n[Augustine (354-430 AD)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Augustine_of_Hippo)\n\n> Woman was merely man\u2019s helpmate, a function which pertains to her alone. **She is not the image of God** but as far as man is concerned, he is by himself the image of God.\n\n[Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274 AD)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thomas_Aquinas)\n\n> Woman was made **only** to assist with procreation.","upvote_ratio":0.29,"created_utc":1678669006.0},{"title":"I think I found God","author":"Appropriate-Ad-9232","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11p6d6h\/i_think_i_found_god\/","text":"To preface this, I just want to say that this is my first time using Reddit so I am a little unfamiliar with somethings. However, this recent awakening has been so powerful that I need to just spill my thoughts somewhere.\n\nI was raised in rural Ireland which means by default, I was raised in a community with strong Christian beliefs. Because it was the norm growing  up, I guess this pushed me to reject my belief and faith in God as a form of rebellion. However, I think it was always there and tried to manifest in other ways, when I was a young teenager I experimented with Wicca and paganism to get more in touch with my Celtic roots and express some form of belief in a higher power but nothing ever stuck. As the years went by, I eventually settled in an Atheist outlook and while it seemed logical in my head,  it made me feel miserable. \n\nI have always struggled with happiness in life, there is always something weighing on me. Either it be from outside circumstances or my own inner turmoil. However, recently I was watching the youtuber Wendigoon. He has a video about lost books of the bible which discusses gospels that were not added to the bible and why. Watching him passionately explain about the immense process of how the bible has been protected over the years was really my first step forward. I am sorry to admit that I had my doubts in the first place but this bit of credibility really helped push me. I began to do my own research on the bible and the word of God and I feel like my whole life has changed within a few days.\n\nThe lessons and teachings resonated with me instantly, perhaps they were always within me from my Christian upbringing. The intense love and passion that is shown for us by God, his unending care and mercy is something I will never take for granted again. I feel a sense of inner peace I have not felt in such a long, long, long time. Knowing God is in my life has made me want to take better care of myself, cherish the time with my family and loved ones and has created such a sacred personal part of myself that I cherish as my own. It has returned the flame to my life, I feel the need to express myself through art and poetry again, hobbies I left behind through my depression.\n\nI have began praying every night, sending loving thoughts to family that have passed on and have started to visit their graves more often. I want to devote myself further to attone for shunning God in my past and I'm considering attending church as well as finally actually obtaining my own bible. I know this post may sound like the ramblings of a crazy person but the people in my life still have the same viewpoint as I did before and if I were to express myself to this point, they may think I have gone insane lol. \n\nI am still me, I still think and feel for others the same. But now I feel as though I have this weight lifted from my shoulders, I have this unbreakable trust that God is always there for me and the comfort that brings to my life is so overwhelming I start to tear up just thinking about it. I apologise about the long post or if this isn't exactly the type of post that is supposed to be shared here but wow, I genuinely cannot believe I was lost for so long and the answer was always here with me. I hope others understand my words or people who are ready for their own awakening, see this post. Perhaps it will be their first step. \n\nI feel like a winner, like I've finally won the lotto. I'm going to go sleep now and for the first time in my adult life, I look forward to the next day. \n\nGoodnight everyone and God bless \u2665\ufe0f","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678599005.0},{"title":"Amazing church Service","author":"Relevant_Present4985","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11plmj6\/amazing_church_service\/","text":"For anyone needing a break through or wanting to feel the presence of God, check out https:\/\/oasistx.org\/live last service.

Alarms awaken us in the morning and the late news puts us to bed at night. If we are employed, we are controlled by the train or bus schedule, when the next meeting is, our lunch with a client, then schedule phone or zoom calls. This repeats itself day after day. Our lives run like a clock. Or do they?\n\nNow I realize that I am retired, but if I allow it, the clock can determine my life. I still have meetings, many on zoom. My doctors appointments and therapy sessions, both physical and mental, are frequent; and my yoga classes at the local YMCA are on a schedule. The clock may not control my life as it was when I was teaching, but it still tends to dictate my week.\n\nBut let us ignore (if possible) all of these minor distractions and concentrate on something much more important and much more agreeable to ponder and to place in the forefront of our thinking.

There is not one thing out there greater than I am nor I greater than anything out there. This is a dynamic thought! I write a lot about love, because God created me in a moment of spiritual and physical love.

I felt a strong urge to go, again kind of hard to explain. Like this really strong urge. I ended up calling my mom as she is a beliver and told her what I\\`ve been going through lately. She got quiet and said that today, at 5 pm, she and my uncle is going to see my grandparents to talk about something serious they had to share.

It is true that Jesus has died for our sins, and he has paid the price for our sins and we are saved once we believe, but it is never said that the commanments become irrelevant. Jesus said in John 14:15; \" ***If you love me, obey my commandments.***\" and he gave the reason why later in the chapter in John 14:21 saying; \" ***Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.***\"\n\nWe can see that obeying the commandments is a show of love for God. Ofcourse we are not saved by obeying the commandments but obeying the commandments should be part of our lives. We should try to obey his commandments as a sign of love for God, and God in response will reveal himself to us as a show of his love.\n\nWhat are these commandments? you may ask, they can all be found in the gospel of the new testament(most of them are, because Jesus preached them), the writing of the apostles, and the revelation. But keep in mind most of them are also in the old testaments, and thats including the famous 10 commandments which are also known as \"the decalogue\". We can only know the commandments Jesus is talking about here by reading the bible. We need to understand why the commandments were given in the first place and understand the reasoning behind it, how its for our own good and how if obeyed, benefits us.\n\nUltimately Jesus said by loving God and loving your neighbours, you have fulfilled all his commands. And you can see the sense in that. How do I show my love for God?, Jesus said \"obey my commands\" . Look at love your neighbors for example; if your love your neighbour you would not steal from them, you will not sleep with his wife, and so on. So by that you are obeying the commands given by Jesus. If you love God, you will give to those in need, you will worship him, you will not commit murder, you would not commit adultery, you will not defraud, you will not bear false witness, and so on. \n\nSo you can see by loving God you obey his commandments and by obeying his commandments, you show your love for God.\n\nAlthough we may come short on some commandments, we should not then neglect these commanments because Jesus forgives us, rather we should ask for forgiveness and pay more attention to ourselves and strive to obey God as a sign of our love for him. When we realise we have fallen short, yes we should feel remorseful, but we should not feel discouraged, rather we should turn to God and pray for the holy spirit to guide and help us.\n\nMay the Holy Spirit guide us, and give us the strenght and desire to obey God's commandments, so we can express our love for him. Amen.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678589249.0},{"title":"He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him.

Below I discuss more.","author":"ArtVandelayDesign","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11p0tis\/why_do_many_believers_give_satan_more_power_than\/","text":"So I like to listen to a lot of apologetic videos\/books and theologians speak. Early in my 20s I found out for the first time I had been wrong about Satan. I believed for the longest time he could hear my thoughts like God can, but he can't. God created me Satan did not create me. Demonic forces can see my outsides and manipulate which can lead to bad thoughts though. I told a group of Christian friends about how Satan may have never directly been in their room or house because he is limited to where he can be with billions of humans on this planet (he can move more quickly than humans obviously). That doesn't mean he hasn't directly attacked a powerful ministry or those involved to destroy their faith in the work they are doing. He could have periods where he is located in Asia, Africa, the middle east, or Europe and not in the United States. Satan does not have omnipresence, omnipotence, nor omniscience. He roams the earth, but is not everywhere at once because that is only a power which marks the deity of God.\n\nThis is an uncomfortable truth, but God has Satan on a leash. There are two lions. One is on the throne and one is on a leash. God tells Satan what he will allow him to do because he knows the outcome. Ultimately, Satan may think he is destroying everything, but God knows the end result of that tempting or disaster.  I talked to my pastor about this recently and his thought was some don't want to be responsible for their sins and don't like the idea that God and Satan communicate so they'd rather think of him as a completely autonomous being who is all powerful and constantly attacking them. But we see God and Satan conversing about Job, but God knows Job's heart and Satan does not. The holy spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted. God allowed Satan to tempt Jesus. \n\nBut regardless there are 3 things at play when it comes to temptation, suffering, and sin that all work together. 1. The Flesh\/Being fallen 2. Spiritual Warfare 3. Satan. I've known people to claim that Satan is tempting them and I think to myself, Satan doesn't have to do that because I have my own flesh that can tempt me. We have to combine all of those together for a full picture of our own lives and what is going on in the world. Sometimes I can't put blame on anything, but myself. Now, I did feel a time in ministry where things kept going wrong and I do believe that was spiritual warfare.\n\nEDIT: I just did a Google search and you will find most articles from many sources of different theologians state that Satan's (and his demons') \"power is by permission\" only.\" All his acts of opposition to God and God\u2019s people are part of God\u2019s plan as he gives Satan permission. He has no autonomy to do anything God does not permit for infinitely wise purposes.\n\nThis can actually be comforting even though it feels weird. It means God is supreme. If Satan had full autonomy over the earth as a created being, he would be a god figure himself and therefore there would be dueling gods at work. Doing whatever he wanted (and his demons too) would be called omnipotence and therefore he would have a characteristic of the deity of God.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678582837.0},{"title":"Are you for self defense?

This all happened a week ago\n\nA close girlfriend of mine who is my age decided to confide in me that she was pregnant unexpectedly and was planning to have an abortion. She was extremely early along. Her husband (who I am also close with) was scheduled for a vasectomy a few days after she found out. They are religious; I wouldn\u2019t call them extremely devout but they certainly are believers. The husband is activity involved in their Christian church. She is not as involved and doesn\u2019t attend as frequently, as they have two young kids and their lives are a little chaotic. Their families are also very religious, which is why they decided to not confide in them because they knew they would not have their support if they told them their plans. Now I don\u2019t know the details of how simple or difficult a decision this was for them, or their feelings individually. I do know my girlfriend is very black and white, and they way she saw it their marriage was difficult enough with their young family, their finances were a mess, her husband worked 80+ hours a week often 6 or even 7 days a week to keep up with the bills. Her pregnancies have been not ideal and the way she described it she had no positive feelings about being suddenly pregnant or the thought of having another child, although she was an emotional mess with the situation. \n\nQuickly because it\u2019s relevant- I became a Christian about a year ago with the influence in part from my boyfriend and his mum who are.. well I would say strong Christians but I\u2019ll just say for now solid in their faith. My boyfriend\u2019s mom has been a good guide and is a good resource. She\u2019s a little intense but I\u2019ve been able to filter what she sends my way. All in all I am grateful for them and the path I\u2019m on now. \n\nBack to my friend- I have never been in a position like this before. I have my personal thoughts and feelings about abortion but have never had to act on them personally or reflect on them when someone close to me was in crisis. I knew how I needed to show up for her as her friend, but I didn\u2019t know if I needed to show up for her as a Christian too. So I thought, who better to ask. \n\n\nA few days after my friend had confided in me, my boyfriend\u2019s mom (let\u2019s call her Rita) and I go for a pedicure and dinner that we had planned for weeks now. It was a great evening, our relationship was on the mend (she had gotten her nose in places where it shouldn\u2019t have been not too long ago) and I was very happy we got to spend some quality time together. Over dinner, I asked her if I could seek her guidance with a dilemma I was facing. Of course she said yes and I told her in short the situation.\n\nNow she knows my friends name. I have referred to them as my friends before, maybe a few times and no specifics, just that they\u2019re good friends of mine. She has not met them, doesn\u2019t know what they look like, knows they have kids and they\u2019re Christians because I told her but that\u2019s about as much she knew about them. \n\nWhen I told her I expected the response I got. \u201cOh, noooo, they can\u2019t! She caaaaaaan\u2019t! Tell them to keep it! A life is a life, there is a spark right at conception this is so saaaaad\u201d yadda yadda. I wasn\u2019t asking her take on the situation I was asking her for advice as a Christian. I told her I was second guessing my position, and thought that later on down the road say my girlfriend is depressed about the decision in hindsight, her and her husband get a divorce because he resents her.. something like that. And I was too impartial and didn\u2019t say what I should have.. or if prayer was enough, etc etc. \n\nThe conversation was about 5 minutes long. We were at dinner for at least an hour and a half. We didn\u2019t revisit, neither of us brought it up when I saw her next a couple days later. \n\nMy girlfriend was scheduled for her procedure I would say 10 or so days after she told me. She asked if I would come keep her company afterward. I said of course. I told no one but Rita. I didn\u2019t even tell my boyfriend. \n\nThe day before her appointment she calls me in a rage. Someone spilled the tea. She had no idea who, she was ready to sue the hospital thinking it was a breach of confidentiality.. since nobody they told (all 2 of us) wouldn\u2019t say anything. After the phone call I immediately call Rita, to see if there was ANY way this could have gotten out, since she was the only person I told. She assured me no, but then she did tell me that she asked her bible study group for prayer. I said I didn\u2019t love that she did that much but I urged her to tell me if she gave away any specifics; my name, my friends name\u2026 enough for someone to connect the dots if they happened to know the right person or family in the city we all live in. She said no. I told her the situation, that someone said something and it got to the pastor, and now back to my friends.\n\nTo make the rest of this long story short, Rita took it upon herself to (yup, you guessed it) find out what church they went to (I don\u2019t even know, still) and call the pastor of that church and tell him anonymously. The pastor called my friends\u2019 family so that added a whole different level of complication because he should have just called my friends directly.. but that aside the cat was out of the bag. \n\nMy friend followed through with the procedure, even after they knew the pastor and half their family knew. While she was at her appointment I was buying them flowers and saying prayers when I got the call from the husband saying the anonymous caller had a name (Rita\u2019s last name) and a phone number (their house phone). My heart sank to my feet and as a wave of devastation came over me I told him I had to make a call. \n\nI call Rita in tears and told her she made a huge mistake. She actually said \u201cwhat happened?\u201d and when I told her that she knew exactly what she did and how she lied to me about it a couple days before she started spouting off about how as a Christian she had to make a choice blah blah blah and I hung up on her. I haven\u2019t talked to her since. \n\nMy friends will forgive me but now they question my judgment and trust. I take my word seriously and I\u2019ve never been so let down and felt so betrayed in my life. She knows these are my closest friends in this town. My friends aren\u2019t allowed back in church until the pastor decides if it\u2019s worth the church\u2019s reputation should anybody else find out. Which is really quite something in my opinion. My girlfriend is so angry at the church and what people go the lengths to do in the name of Christianity she says she\u2019s never stepping foot in that church again. I don\u2019t blame her. I feel a similar anger. \n\n\nRita wants to make amends. I do not. I don\u2019t know how anything she could say to me could rectify this situation and what she did. Nothing will make it any better but time.  I don\u2019t want to hear any explanation I do not care as it is clear to me her beliefs are more important than our trust, even though I\u2019ll likely be in her life for the rest of it. I won\u2019t hold a grudge forever but our relationship won\u2019t ever be the same. It won\u2019t be with my friends either. I sit questioning her moral compass since she had no difficulty lying to me the day before with ease. I find it alarmingly hypocritical, but it\u2019s all made her priorities clear.\n\n\nIs this acceptable behaviour? Can someone explain to me how on earth this could have been the right call to make?

Gradually, I noticed that I was getting called out publicly alot by our two new Creative Team leaders, and not entirely in a contructive manner. And this was for things that simply did not need it - for example, referring to the production team as the team I look after would result in being called out for not being a \"team player\" because it was \"all of our team\". Silly things like that. \n\nAfter about 9 months of this, the impact on my mental health started to become noticable, so I removed myself from their \"core team\", and opted to continue to work on my own doing what I did. The two new leaders chose to believe that this would not work, and continued to bully me out of my role, ensuring that if I did certain responsibilities that I am actually employed to do, that I would be yelled at, called out in public, or have to face meetings with the board. \n\nBefore Christmas last year, myself, the two Creative Team leaders, and the chair of our board met and came to a decision where we were to be able to operate within our passions. My passion was identified as fulfilling the responsibilities in my job description, and rostering and co-ordinating production at our Youth program. As a result, I chose to take a break from my role as a musician for a short time while we got our footing again, which was not appreciated at all by our two Creative Team leaders. As a result, they chose without provocation at all to remove me from all production related serving roles, and threatened that by doing what I was doing (my job) that I was damaging our relationship. \n\nSo, I was left in a position where I was unable to do my job, for fear of damaging relationships. This was immediately raised with the board, who only just last week attempted to resolve it by re-inforcing my job description. As of now, I am still not permitted to serve with the team that I look after, I am still unable to serve with the youth team, and this is to an extent where team members are now being severely overworked by being rostered on for multiple roles at a time (lights + media, FOH + Broadcast, Producer + Cameras, etc) to avoid being in a position where I may need to be rostered. And as happened today, when I stepped in to help in a gap in the rostering, someone was called in who was taking a well needed break so that they could serve instead of me. \n\nI am in a position where I am seriously considering resigning, and changing churches. I've had a resignation letter penned out now for a few weeks, and as much as it will hurt losing income, I'm considering it because my mental health cannot take any more of it at all, and because I do not believe that I should be serving and working in a house that will take almost no action against this kind of behaviour. \n\nJust wanting to get some different opinions about what it is that I am going through at the moment if you would be so kind.

They touch upon issues ranging from the soteriology of the gospel to eschatological prophecy.\n\nIn fact, Jesus himself told his disciples that if one does not understand the *parable of the soils* (Mark 4:3-9, Luke 8:5-8, & Matt 13:3-9), there is no understanding the other parables. And if you can't grasp the parables, then the Bible will remain a mystery to you.  \n\n>[Mar 4:13 NASB95] 13 And He said to them, \"Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?\n\n\nWhy is it that this parable is fundamental to the general understanding of the Bible? It's because this parable is essentially the gospel message. \n\nFour soils are presented; roadside soil, stoney soil, thistle-infested soil, and good soil. The Word is sown as a seed on all four qualities of soil. \n\n**Roadside soil**: The birds eat up the seed before it can germinate, that is before the Word can be believed. \n\n**Stoney soil**: The seed germinates, which means the Word is believed - the believer is justified by faith and born again (germination) - but due to lack of depths, the scorching heat of the sun (persecution) kills the newly germinated seed. That which was born again, dies again, and returns to unrighteousness. In fact, Luke 8:13 explains that these believers believed for a while before falling away. They had real, authentic faith, but fell away very quickly. \n\n**Thistle-infested soil**: The seed is germinated (faith-justified and born again), but the plant is choked out by the distractions and anxieties of the world, before it can bear fruit. \n\n**Good soil**: The seed is germinated, it takes root, and it grows to full maturity yielding abundant fruit for the harvest. Luke 8:15 specifically says that these believers \"held fast\" [Strong's G2722] to their faith. \n\n**The good-soil believers are the only group of believers who will be saved.**\n\nIn fact, Paul explained this in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.\n\n>[1Co 15:1-4 NASB95] 1 Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, \n>2 BY WHICH YOU ARE SAVED, **IF YOU HOLD FAST [Strong's G2722]** the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. \n>3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,\n\n\nIt should be clear at this point, that a true believer in Christ, who has expressed authentic faith, can indeed lose salvation if they abandon their faith. We can abandon our faith by departing from our walk in the Spirit, and engaging in the works of the flesh. \n\n\nOne such way to abandon the Spirit is to sever yourself from Christ by returning to the Law of Moses. Romans 7 makes it clear that the Law of Moses was a set of marriage vows for our **past** union with the flesh. To keep the Law of Moses out of \"obedience to God\" is to become distracted by a worldly anxiety, through seeking justification by the works of the flesh. \n\nI've seen many contrived and convoluted explanations from Torah Observant believers, who think that Paul was actually keeping the Law of Moses and encouraged other Christians to do the same. This is simply untrue!\n\nIn order to keep the Law of Moses, a male believer first has to be physically circumcised.  Titus was never circumcised. There are many believers (including in Paul's day) who were not, and never will be, physically circumcised. \n\n>[Gal 2:3 NASB95] 3 But **not even Titus**, who was with me, though he was a Greek, **was compelled to be circumcised**.\n\n>[Gal 5:2-4 NASB95] 2 **Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you. 3 And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.** 4 You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.\n\n>[Exo 12:48 NASB95] 48 \"But if a stranger sojourns with you, and celebrates the Passover to the LORD, **let all his males be circumcised**, and then let him come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land. **But no uncircumcised person may eat of it.**\n\n>[Eze 44:9 NASB95] 9 'Thus says the Lord GOD, **\"No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and UNCIRCUMCISED IN FLESH, of all the foreigners who are among the sons of Israel, shall enter My sanctuary.**\n\n\n**YOU CANNOT PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT PART OF THE LAW OF MOSES YOU WISH TO KEEP.** \n\n>[Deu 4:2 NASB95] 2 \"You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.\n\n\nTLDR\/Conclusion: We are justified by faith, but if we fail to hold fast to our faith, we can and will lose justification and salvation. Consistent and willful failure to walk in the Spirit qualifies as a loss of justification. You who say, \"we must keep the Law of Moses in obedience to God\", have placed yourselves under a curse. Paul clearly taught against physical circumcision, which was prerequisite for keeping the Law of Moses. Deuteronomy 4:2 **explicitly states** that the Law could not be edited in any way, **so nothing can replace physical circumcision.** \n\nIf you're attempting to keep the Law of Moses out of \"obedience to God\", then you have already departed from Christ. If you are doing this out of ignorance, then you may repent and be forgiven, but if you harden your heart and continue to walk in the willful ignorance of the flesh, then there simply is no other sacrifice for you.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678599007.0},{"title":"Taste of blood.","author":"tnicole21","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11p8mnr\/taste_of_blood\/","text":"Ok, so I know this is going to sound odd but as I was praying tonight I swear I could taste blood.

However, as I've posted before once, he does things that seem like he is a fake Christian and I don't know if it's his bipolar or not.\n\n1. I spot his lies and inconsistencies a lot in casual talk and conversation.\n2. He says that he stopped smoking and this and that to me to make himself look holy, but I still see him smoke and etc.\n3. He asked me for $1,000, gave it back to me. We went out for coffee the day he returned it and then he said he had to stop by a dealer real quick. He leased the car and asked me back for the money and I felt tricked.\n4. He returned my $1,000 last week and just 2-3 days after, he asked me for $10,000 for a business proposition that he's only \"telling me\" because he'd rather I be the one to benefit from this idea.\n5. He went to Vegas and slept with a prostitute. He told me he prayed for forgiveness and repentance, but asked me if I know a whore he can call after saying he repented. His car got thrashed and for months he's saying he is waiting on a big insurance claim and will pay me back. Why then are you asking me for more money?\n6. He calls me knowing I have cancer and dealing with chemo. Asks me how I'm doing and halfway just interrupts me to either ask me for money or go out for food or coffee or something on his mind.\n\nNow, he has gotten ahold of my Mom's phone number. Quite frankly, I don't know if this is his disorder or if he's annoying or what. He has moments of cleverness and deceit that the Pastor has called him out on. His wife has divorced him and put a restraining order against him.\n\nI have cancer, and I cannot deal with him right now. I wish to block him, but am afraid of punishment by God, or when God says he will not forgive those who do not forgive. I also don't wish for this man to pray on me as he did in the past.\n\nWhat do I do? I'm 25 and he's 50. Every time I answer or pick up, he starts to call me even more. I thought by not responding to his calls, he will eventually stop bothering me. I also understand part of it may be his bipolar, and I don't wish to judge him for that but he does need help :\/. I just feel bad. My therapist tells me to stop and set boundaries as I am in no position to help or be in a relationship like this. He denies treatment from my understanding of things. In my gut, I'm just mainly angry at his actions and feel like he lies a lot.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678580847.0},{"title":"dear christian men who are able to abstain from porn\/masturbation\/sex for long periods of time; please give some advice on how to do it","author":"neonberry0","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11p1qua\/dear_christian_men_who_are_able_to_abstain_from\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678585403.0},{"title":"Praying or simply talking with God","author":"AspectAdventurous549","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11oxsrh\/praying_or_simply_talking_with_god\/","text":"Hey, I wanted to ask, what is true prayer supposed to be like? \nIt's only been one month since I have tried to build a relationship with God.

I found it to be a rather interesting conversation. He  discussed several things which he found to be adequate evidence to  discount the existence of God, none of which stood to any measure of  inspection. Yet, he vehemently stood firm on the grounds of\u00a0*\"scientific fact.\"*  He related to me that he found believing in God to be an impossibility,  due to a lack of evidence. I heard him out and then decided to share  with him some things important to his situation.\n\nI began with the statement,\u00a0*\"It takes more faith to be an Atheist than it does to be a Christian.\"*\u00a0If  nothing else, this statement certainly perked his interest. He then  declared to me that Atheism requires no faith, for it is based upon  solid scientific data. I went on to share the following number of points  with him concerning the faith of an Atheist.\n\n## To Be An Atheist, One Must Believe... That God Does Not Exist\n\nAs  we look about us, we see that man is a religious creature by nature.  Regardless of where you go, you will find people who have a need to  worship some greater being than themselves. The Romans and Greeks had  their mythological gods. Many submit themselves to the worship of  Buddha. Allah is considered by a great number of people to be worthy of  worship and praise. But most of all, the God of heaven, the one true God  is the focus of many. If you were to stand on a street corner, asking  whether people believe in God or not, I say with confidence that if each  individual answered truthfully, you would be hard-pressed to find any  who will say no.\n\nThis brings us to one of two conclusions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. It is practical and sensible to believe there to be an eternal being superior to ourselves;\n2. The larger part of society is completely irrational.\n\n## To Be An Atheist, One Must Believe... That Matter Is Either Eternal Or It Created Itself\n\nTo  hold to the ideas of atheism, which is for the most part partial to the  theory of evolution, one must believe that matter is either eternal or  it created itself. Seeing that the Atheist has removed the possibility  of a Creator, these are the only two options that remain.\n\nI asked the individual about the nature of the universe:\u00a0**eternal**\u00a0or\u00a0**had a beginning**?  A seemingly easy question, but over and over, he declined to give a  straight answer. Yet, if we look at the evidence, we understand that the  universe had a beginning. Scientists themselves attempt to assign an  age to our planet, and the universe as a whole. Those things which are  eternal have no age. The reason they attempt to assign an age to the  world in which we live is that it bears the characteristics of age. Such  things which are eternal are not governed by time. We are told in  Scripture that with the Lord a \"*day is as a thousand years, a thousand years as a day*\" ([II Peter 3:8](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/2%20Pet%203.8)).  Yet, the universe is subject to time. The universe is running down. It  is wearing out. Things on earth are corrupt and worsening year after  year. It is approaching an inevitable end. It cannot be eternal.\n\nThe  only other option for those who deny the presence of a Supreme God is  that the universe created itself. That is possibly the most absurd thing  which could ever be considered. Matter does not have the ability to  create itself. A desk cannot bring itself into existence. What man has  ever created himself? If matter were able to create itself, consider the  chaos which would occur! One would possibly be driving along a road,  and a tree would appear from nowhere! Yet such things do not occur!\n\n## To Be An Atheist, One Must Believe... That Life is Spontaneously Generated\n\nIn  denying the existence of God, the Atheist is forced to believe that  life is able to spontaneously generate. In other words, life can come  from that which has none. We understand God to be the Creator of all  things, and that He is the source of life. Yet, if we remove God from  the picture, we remove the breath of life which He gives. Thus,  somewhere along the line, according to the Atheist's belief system, life  spontaneously came into being. It never existed before. It has  absolutely no source. It just started itself somehow at some time.\n\n## To Be An Atheist, One Must Believe... That Order and Design Are Results of Non-Intelligent Accidents\n\nAs  we look about us at the wonders of creation, we can understand that God  is the Master Designer. He purposefully created the world with order.  Trees need carbon dioxide, mammals need oxygen. The two complement one  another with the exchange of these gases. Our planet is exactly the  correct distance from the sun. Any closer, we would burn up. Any further  away, we would freeze. Approximately 2\/3 of the earth is covered with  water. This keeps the core temperature at an acceptable level. The  gravitational forces on earth are such that we can walk freely about,  without fear of being driven into the ground, or lifted into space. The  human body is a wondrous design. It is designed to repair itself in many  instances. It has several functions which automatically are cared for  without the need for us even thinking about them. As was written, we are  \"*fearfully and wonderfully made*\" ([Psalms 139:14](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Ps%20139.14)).\n\nThe  Atheist though must affirm that all these wonders and many, many more  are merely the result of an accidental happening. They claim that no  intelligence was involved in the forming of our world. It was simply the  process of a \"big bang.\" If such is possible, that something as  wonderful as the universe can result from an unintelligent \"bang,\" then  something which is infinitely simpler should also be able to come  together with a logical order and design without intelligence. For  instance, what if we should disassemble a watch, place all the parts  into a box, close the box, and begin shaking. How long before the watch  will be fully assembled again? Shake as much and as hard as you can, you  will never result in a watch. Though all the needed parts are present, a  watchmaker is also needed. A source of intelligent construction. How  much more does the universe need an intelligent Maker?\n\n## To Be An Atheist, One Must Believe... That Non-Consciousness Evolves to Consciousness\n\nThe  theory of evolution affirms that we are the descendants of a one-cell  organism. This one-cell organism has no consciousness. It does not know  that it exists. We, who are conscious of ourselves, and of the  happenings surrounding us, according to the assertions of the atheist  have evolved from this creature. How is it we became conscious beings?  Can consciousness come from unconsciousness? If it can, does that mean  that someday my desk will be aware of itself? I should hope not; it may  decide then to walk away since it would be its own being.\n\n## To Be An Atheist, One Must Believe... That Non-Morality Evolves to Morality\n\nAtheists  have a hard time explaining morality. If we evolved from creatures who  operate on instinct, not conscience, how is it that we have developed  the ability to use conscience? Where did morality find its beginning?  Did one ape finally decide that killing another ape was wrong? Did one  decide that it was wrong to steal another ape's supper? No such things  have occurred! Morality finds it origin in the existence of God. He has  given a law, which therein establishes morality. However, the Atheist  cannot explain where morality came from.\n\nFurther, the Atheist can  not give a reason for doing good. There is no reason, if we will not be  judged. Why should we yield our own desires in order to serve others?  The answer, we shall be judged!\n\nTruly, Atheism is a faith. And  without doubt, upon careful examination, it would seem that it takes  more faith to be an Atheist than it does to be a Christian. Paul wrote, \"*since  the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen,  being understood by the things which are made, even His eternal power  and Godhead, so that they are without excuse*\" ([Romans 1:20](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Rom%201.20)). The world which we live in declares on a daily basis,\u00a0**God Is**.  If one is sincere in their search, they cannot help but come to the  conclusion that there is an eternal God, who is Creator of all.\n\n>\"*In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.*\" ([Genesis 1:1](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/esv\/Gen%201.1)).","upvote_ratio":0.13,"created_utc":1678650455.0},{"title":"Christianity itself (not human nature) is what causes Christians to do\/ say horrible things","author":"dougie567","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11pm2f1\/christianity_itself_not_human_nature_is_what\/","text":"So I'm sure this is going to be deleted but I feel like this needs to be said\n\nWhenever someone posts someone doing something horrible on here the replies tend to be something similar to this: \"It isn't Christianity that made them do that!

I've prayed about it but I can't stop thinking about one in particular. I kinda felt for a while that she was flirting but then she got a boyfriend, then she broke up with him, we were basically best friends and she got even more flirtatious, then got a new boyfriend. While she was single, I was eventually able to come to peace with the fact that she was here for just 1 year. Then she told me she felt called to stay for 4 years. That threw me back in but I came back to peace via her being in missions and myself not feeling called to travel. She later explains that she specifically feels called to serve the homeless in the city. I didn't move on before she started dating someone else. \n\nI've been trying and praying to move on but I feel jealous, and abandoned yet still happy around her and it's so draining.

These is a theme he has been drumming home for a while in his papacy. Anyways Peterson proceeded to critique the Pope saying Christianity is about individual salvation, not social justice. Now this is a common thing that I have heard a lot. That social justice is a \"distraction\" from the gospel or worst, its a heresy. And its promoted by people who say they are defending the \"authority of scripture\" or the \"authority of the tradition\". The reality is the opposite. The heresy isn't defending social justice. The heresy is opposing and condemning social justice and then saying that's Christian. Social justice literally means creating a society without oppression or exploitation. That is literally taught in Christian and Biblical doctrine. I am going to be providing extensive evidence for my assertion through Biblical evidence and evidence from the Church tradition and Church history. Buckle up because this will be a really, really, really long post, but frankly. I don't care. Because weaponising Christianity to demonise social justice needs to be answered and quite honestly critiqued. So here goes.\n\n**Biblical evidence:**\n\n* \"*You must not exploit a widow or an orphan. If you exploit them in anyway and they cry out to me, then I will blaze against you, and I will kill you with the sword*\"(Exodus 22:22-23)\n* \"*For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords. He is the great God, the mighty and awesome God, who shows no partiality and cannot be bribed. He ensures that orphans and widows receive justice. He shows love to the foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing*\"(Deuteronomy 10:17-18)\n* \"*Never take advantage of poor and destitute laborers, whether they are fellow Israelites or foreigners living in your towns. You must pay them their wages each day before sunset because they are poor and are counting on it. If you don't, they might cry out to the Lord against you and it would be counted against you as sin*\"(Deuteronomy 24:14-15) \n* \"*True justice must be given to foreigners living among you, and to orphans, and you must never accept a widow's garment as security for her debt. Always remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God redeemed you from your slavery. That is why I have given you this command*\"(Deuteronomy 24:17-18) \n* \"*Cursed is anyone who denies justice to foreigners, orphans, or widows. And all the people will reply Amen*\"(Deuteronomy 27:19) \n* \"*But the Lord reigns forever, executing judgement from his throne. He will judge the world with justice and rule the nations with fairness. The Lord is a shelter for the oppressed, and refuge in times of trouble*\"(Psalm 9:7-9) \n* \"*Lord you know the hopes of the helpless. Surely you will hear their cries and comfort them. You will bring justice to the orphans and the oppressed so mere people can no longer terrify them*\"(Psalm 10:17-18) \n* \"*Give your love of justice to the king o God, and righteousness to the king's son. Help him judge your people in the right way; let the poor always be treated fairly. May the mountains yield prosperity for all, and my the hills be fruitful. Help him to defend the poor, to rescue the children of the needy, and to crush their oppressors*\"(Psalm 72:1-4) \n* \"*He will rescue the poor when they cry to him; he will help the oppressed, who have no one to defend them. He feels pity for the weak and the needy, and he will rescue them. He will redeem them from oppression and violence for their lives are precious to him*\"(Psalm 72:12-14) \n* \"*Give justice to the poor and the orphan; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute. Rescue the poor and helpless; deliver them from the grasp of evil people. But these oppressors know nothing; they are so ignorant. They wander about in darkness, while the whole world is shaken to the core*\"(Psalm 82:3-5) \n* \"*Learn to do good. Seek justice, help the oppressed. Defend the cause of the orphans. Fight for the rights of widows*\"(Isaiah 1:17) \n* \"*The Lord comes forward to pronounce judgement on the elders and rulers of his people: 'You have ruined Israel, my vineyard. Your houses are filled with things stolen from the poor. How dare you crush my people, grinding the faces of the poor into the dust' demands the Lord, Lord of Heaven's armies*\"(Isaiah 3:14-15) \n* \"*Then the King will say to those on his right'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you fed me. I was thirsty and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger and you invited me into your home. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you care for me, I was in prison and you visited me. Then these righteous ones will reply 'Lord when did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink? Or a stranger and show you hospitality? Or naked and give you clothing? When did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you? And the King will say 'I will tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were doing it to me*\"(Matthew 25:34-40)\n* \"*The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor.

Your wealth is rotting away and your fine clothes are moth-eaten rags.....Hear the cries of field workers whom you have cheated of their pay. The cries of those who harvest your fields have reach the ears of the Lord of Heaven's armies. You have spent your years on earth in luxury, satisfying your every desire. You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter. You have condemned and killed innocent people who do not resist you*\"(James 5:1-2\/4-6)\n\n**Church tradition: The Church Fathers** \n\n* \"*The ways of death on the other hand is this:..those not showing mercy to the poor, not toiling for the one weighed down by toil, those not knowing the ones having made them, those murderers of children, those corruptors of God's workmanship, those turning way the needy, those weighing down with toil the oppressed, those advocates of the rich, those lawless judges of the poor, those totally sinful. May you be saved, oh children from all these*\"\\_The Didache\n* \"*But consider those who are of a different opinion from us, as to what concerns the grave of Jesus Christ which is come unto, how contrary they are to the design of God. They have no regard to charity, no care of the widow, the fatherless, and the oppressed; of the slave or free, of the hungry or thirsty*\"\\_St Ignatius of Antioch(Letter to the Smyrneans) \n* \"*What will you answer the Judge? You gorgeously array you walls, but do not clothe your fellow human beings; you adorn horses, but turn way from the shameful plight of your brother or sister; you allow grain to rote in your barns, but do not feed those who are starving; you hide gold in the earth, but ignore the oppressed*\"\\_St Basil the Great(To the Rich)\n* \"*Great rivers begin from tiny streams, but eventually acquire irresistible magnitude by means of small additions, so that they violently sweep away whatever lies in their path; thus it is with those who advance to positions of great power. From those who previously held dominance, they receive the ability to treat many others unjustly. They oppress those who remain unscathed through those who are already victims of injustice; as wickedness overflows, it gives them an opportunity to expand their power. Those who have already been badly treated render them a king of involuntary assistance by inflicting harm and injustice upon others in turn*\"\\_St Basil the Great(To the Rich) \n* \"*How can I bring the sufferings of the poverty-stricken to your attention? When they look around inside their hovels, they do not spy any gold among their things, nor shall they ever. They find only clothes and furnishings so miserable that, if all their belongings were reckoned together, they would be worth only a few cents. What then? They turn their gaze to their own children, thinking that perhaps bring them to the slave market they might find some respite from death. Consider how the violent struggle that takes place between the desperation arising from famine and a parent's fundamental instincts. Starvation on the one side threatens a horrible death, while nature resists, convincing the parents rather to die with their children....and while parents come with tears streaming down their faces to sell their dearest children, you are now swayed by their sufferings; you take no account of nature. While famine oppresses these miserable wretches, you helm and haw, feigning ignorance and thus prolonging the agony. They come offering their very heart in exchange for food. And yet not only is your hand not stricken with paralysis for taking profits from such misfortune, but you haggle for even more*\"\\_St Basil the Great(To the Rich) \n* \"*But whom do I treat unjustly you say by keeping what is my own? Tell me, what is your own? What did you bring into this life? From where did you receive it? It is as if someone were to take first seat in the theater, then bar everyone else from attending, so that one person alone enjoys what is offered for the benefit of all in common-this is what the rich do. They seize common goods before others have the opportunity, then claim them as their own by right of preemption......who are the greedy? Those who are not satisfied wit what suffices for their own needs. Who are the robbers? Those who take for themselves what rightfully belongs to everyone. And you, are you not greedy? Are you not a robber? The things you received in trust as a stewardship, have you not appropriated them for yourself? Is not the person who strips another of clothing called a thief? And those who do not cloth the naked when they have the power to do so, should they not be called the same? The bread you are holding back is for the hungry, the clothes you keep put away are for the naked, the shoes that are rotting away with disuse are for those who have none, the silver you keep buried in the earth is for the needy. You are thus guilty of injustice as many as you might have aided and did not*\"\\_St Basil the Great(To the Rich)\n* \"*Let no Judas approach this table......neither account it enough for our salvation if after we have stripped widows and orphans we offer for this table a gold and jeweled cup. For is there any point in his table being laden with golden cups while he himself is perishing from hunger? First fill him when he is hungry and then set his table with lavish ornaments. Are you making a golden cup for him at the very moment when you refuse to give him a cup of cold water? Do you decorate his table with cloths flecked with gold, while at the same time you neglect to give him what is necessary for him to cover himself? . . . The conclusion is: Don\u2019t neglect your brother in his distress while you decorate his house. Your brother is more truly his temple than any church building*\"\\_St John Chrysostom(Homily 50 on the Gospel of Matthew) \n* \"*Don\u2019t envy the man whom you see riding through the streets with a troop of attendants to drive the crowds out of his way. It is absurd! Why, my dear sir, if I may ask, do you thus drive your fellow creatures before you? Are you a wolf or a lion? Your Lord, Jesus Christ, raised man to Heaven: but you do not condescend to share even the market place with him. When you put a gold bit on your horse and a gold bracelet on your slave\u2019s arm, when your clothes are gilded down to your very shoes, you are feeding the most ferocious of all beasts, avarice: you are robbing orphans and stealing from widows and making yourself a public enemy*\\_St John Chrysostom(Homilies on the Psalms) \n* *\u201cIf you cannot remember everything, instead of everything, I beg you, remember this without fail, that not to share our own wealth with the poor is theft from the poor and deprivation of their means of life; we do not possess our own wealth but theirs. If we have this attitude, we will certainly offer our money; and by nourishing Christ in poverty here and laying up great profit hereafter, we will be able to attain the good things which are to come, by the grace and kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom (be glory, honor, and might,) to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.*\\_St John Chrysostom(On Wealth and Poverty) \n\n**Church Tradition: Medieval Scholastics**\n\n* \"*Therefore, with however great a certainty so great thing is believed, that faith will be useless and like something dead unless through love it is strong and alive. For a faith that is accompanied and attended by love will by no means be idle when it has the opportunity to act; instead it will exert itself to act quite frequently, which it could not do without love. That this is so can be proved by just this one fact: one who loves the supreme justice cannot disdain anything just or tolerate anything unjust*\"\\_St Anselm of Canterbury(Monologion, chp 78) \n* \"*Do you not understand that when he bore with generous patience the things inflicted on him because he obediently preserved justice-injuries and slanders and death on the cross between thieves-he gave an example to human beings that they ought not to turn aside from justice that they owe to God, because of any suffering they might experience?*\"\\_St Anselm of Canterbury(Cur Deus Homo, Book 2, chp 18) \n* \"*In the first place there is the order of one part to another, to which corresponds the order of one private individual to another. This order is directed by commutative justice, which is concerned about the mutual dealings between two persons. In the second place there is the order of the whole towards the parts, to which corresponds the order of that which belongs to the community in relation to each single person. This order is directed by distributive justice, which distributes common goods proportionately*\"\\_St Thomas Aquinas(Summa Theologica, Second Part of Second Part, Q 61) \n* \"*Since justice is a cardinal virtue other secondary virtues such as mercy, liberality and the like are connected with it.....Wherefore to succor the needy, which belongs to mercy or pity, and to be liberally beneficent, which pertains to liberality, are by a kind of reduction ascribed to justice as to their principal virtue*\"\\_St Thomas Aquinas(Summa Theologica, Second Part of Second Part, Q 58, 11th Article) \n* \"*Legislators in framing laws attend to what commonly happens; although if the law be applied to certain cases it will frustrate the equality of justice and be injurious to the common good....In these and like cases it is bad to follow the law, and it is good to set aside the letter of the law and to follow the dictates of justice and the common good. This is the subject of epikeia which we call equity. Therefore it is evident that equity is a virtue*\"\\_St Thomas Aquinas(Summa Theologica, Second Part of Second, Q 120, 1st Article) \n* \"*Wherefore it is evident that equity is a subjective part of justice; and justice is predicated of it with priority to being predicated of legal justice, since legal justice is subject to the directions of equity. Hence equity is by way of being a higher rule of human actions*\"\\_St Thomas Aquinas(Summa Theologica, Second Part of Second, Q 121)\n* \"*Thou Shalt not Steal.....Theft is committed in a number of different ways. First, by taking stealthily: 'If the goodman of the house knew at what hour the thief would come.\" This is an act wholly blameworthy because it is a form of treachery. \"Confusion . . . is upon the thief.' Secondly, by taking with violence, and this is an even greater injury: \"They have violently robbed the fatherless.\" Among such that do such things are wicked kings and rulers: \"Her princes are in the midst of her as roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves, they left nothing for the morning. They act contrary to God's will who wishes a rule according to justice: \"By Me kings reign and lawgivers decree just things.\" Sometimes they do such things stealthily and sometimes with violence: \"Thy princes are faithless companions of thieves, they all love bribes, they run after rewards.' At times they steal by enacting laws and enforcing them for profit only: \"Woe to them that make wicked laws.\" And St. Augustine says that every wrongful usurpation is theft when he asks: \"What are thrones but forms of thievery?*'\"\\_St Thomas Aquinas(Commentary on the Ten Commandments) \n\n**Church Tradition: Reformation Era** \n\n* \"*The end, therefore, for which judges bear the sword is to restrain the wicked, and thus to prevent violence from prevailing among men, who are so much disposed to become disorderly and outrageous. According as men increase in strength, they become proportionally audacious in oppressing the weak; and hence it is that rich men seldom resort to magistrates for help, except when they happen to fall out among themselves. From these remarks, it is very obvious why the cause of the poor and needy is here chiefly commended to rulers; for those who are exposed an easy prey to the cruelty and wrongs of the rich have no less need of the assistance and protection of magistrates than the sick have of the aid of the physician. Were the truth deeply fixed in the minds of kings and other judges, that they are appointed to be the guardians of the poor, and that a special part of this duty lies in resisting the wrongs which are done to them, and in repressing all unrighteous violence, perfect righteousness would become triumphant through the whole world. Whoever thinks it not beneath him to defend the poor, instead of allowing himself to be carried hither and thither by favor, will have a regard only to what is right...When iniquity openly prevails, and when, on account of it, sighs and lamentations are everywhere heard, it is in vain for them to pretend that they cannot redress wrongs, unless complaints are addressed to them. Oppression utters a sufficiently loud cry of itself; and if the judge, sitting on a high watch-tower, seems to take no notice of it, he is here plainly warned, that such connivance shall not escape with impunity*.\"\\_John Calvin(Commentary on Psalm 82) \n* \"*For you are powerful not that you may make the weak weaker by oppression, but that you may make them powerful by raising them up and defending them*.\"\\_Martin Luther(Two Kings of Righteousness) \n* \"*The most important and difficult work of this commandment is to protect the holy name of God against all those who misuse it spiritually and to teach them better. It is not enough for me to praise the divine name for myself alone or to call upon it in good and bad times just on my behalf....we must set ourselves against all injustice when the truth or righteousness of God is impugned by force and adversity. We may not make any distinction among persons, as some do who fight with great diligence and persistence against injustice that has been done to the rich and powerful or to their friends but remain silent and passive when it happens to the poor and despised or to their enemies. They do not see the name and honor of God as they really are but look through rose-colored glasses and measure truth and justice by the people affected. They will never be aware of their distorted vision because they privilege the person over the matter itself. They only appear to defend the truth, and that makes them arch-hypocrites through and through. They realize they run no risk when they support the rich, the mighty, the learned, or their friends, who in turn will protect, respect, and otherwise be useful to them. It is very easy, therefore, to protest injustices that happen to popes, kings, princes, bishops, and other bigwigs. In those situations that are not so dire, everyone wants to show how pious they are. Alas, how insidious is the egotism of the old Adam...When, however, something bad happens to a poor and insignificant person, a distorted vision sees no advantage to be gained but only a threat of losing favor with the powerful and prudently leaves the poor person without aid. Who can describe how much this depravity has corrupted Christendom? God declares: \u201cHow long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Give justice to the poor and the orphan; give the afflicted and the destitute their due. Rescue the needy and forsaken; deliver them from the hand of the wicked...That is, they do not see the truth but look only to the bigwigs regardless of how unjust they are and ignore the poor even if justice is all on their side*\"\\_Martin Luther(Treatise on Good Works) \n* \"*I am the voice of the one crying out in the wilderness. I have ascended here to cause you to know those sins, I who am the voice of Christ in the desert of this island. Therefore it is fitting that you listen to this voice, not with careless attention, but with all your heart and senses. For this voice will be the strangest you ever heard, the harshest and hardest, most fearful and most dangerous you have ever thought to hear. This voice declares that you are all in mortal sin and live and die in it, because of the cruelty and tyranny you practise among these innocent peoples. Tell me, by what right or justice do you hold these indigenous people in such cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these peoples who dwelt quietly and peacefully on their own land? Wars in which you have destroyed such infinite numbers of them by homicides and slaughters never before heard of. Why do you keep them so oppressed and exhausted without giving them enough to eat or curing them of sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and die or rather you kill them in order to extract gold every day?*\"\\_Fr Antonio De Montesinos(Advent Sermon, 1511) \n* \"*I leave in the Indies Jesus Christ our God, scourged, afflicted and buffeted and crucified not once, but thousands of times on the part of the Spaniards.*\"\\_Bartolome De Las Casas(A History of the Indies) \n\nThese are long and extensive quotes but its meant to drive home the point that this notion that social justice is in \"contradiction\" to the tenets of Christianity is false and its a lie. The real thing that is in contradiction to Christianity is no to practise or advocate for social justice. The Biblical and historical evidence clearly shows that this is an Anti Christian perspective that's nothing more than heresy. And its a specifically right wing heresy meant to prop up a right wing political project. The people who reject social justice aren't upholding the \"authority of scripture\" or the \"authority of Christian doctrine\" or the \"authority of Church tradition\". They're upholding the authority of right wing politics which they have turned into a Golden Calf.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678489515.0},{"title":"Did a Bible study devotional today on Revelation 16:8 on what does it mean the Sun will scorch people with fire?

If I really want to or not. I'm so conflicted right now and am on the edge. So, I guess I feel like I have no other option. I'll start off with some backstory.\n\nI grew up in a \"Christian\" home that could never decide what denomination we were, so I went through quite a few. Which left me confused in its own right. My mother was well intentioned at times, but ultimately neglectfully of my physical\/mental health, as well as turning a blind eye to the instances where I was sexually abused. She used to tell me that God gave her a vision before I was born that I was going to be a light unto the world and told her what to name me. That I was going to have this big, impactful life that would leave a mark on people. This led to a unnatural obsession for me as I got older and was searching for purpose. The came a time when I was convinced that I was a prophet and was receiving special guidance from God. Unbeknownst to me I was suffering from Bipolar Disorder and that these sorts of thoughts and intense feelings can be common in a lot of individuals. When I became officially diagnosed and treated years later I was devasted to find that my life would have no ultimate purpose and this lead to a total deconstruction of all my belief systems both spiritually and natural. This led to a suicide attempt.\n\nAfter all that occurred I was convinced that God didn't exist and considered myself a die hard atheist. Because of this I encouraged the same process in my wife and it had a great impact on her. After listening to hours of my long winded speeches on the proof against God and her battling with her own doubts she was left in a similar state. She once was happy, loyal and content in her life and our marriage. Since she has gone through this metamorphosis and has changed dramatically and is no longer as supportive of me in my struggles with depression, but has also brought up the idea of divorce a few times. She's also seeing someone else outside of the marriage. This is something that pains me in a way I cannot explain and I blame myself for everything that has happened. We took vows. They were suppose to mean something.\n\nIn full transparency, I once was mad at \"God\" for the things I went through and then decided that I was using whoever God was as a scapegoat to avoid responsibility for my feelings and own actions. Then I started questioning many different aspects of Christian doctrine from Genocide to the flood to anything I could find that I thought was a contradiction. \n\nNow I don't consider myself an atheist. To be honest I don't know what I'am anymore. All I know is that I keep coming back to the God concept and revisiting old beliefs that I held in the past. I can't really escape. I'm afraid of it in a way. Is it mental illness that is the driving force behind my returning interest and open mindedness or is God reaching out to me to pull me back into the flock? I want to be real frank here and say that I'm hurting and there doesn't seem to be an answers out there for me. I've never reached out like this before, so I apologize for the life story. I wanted to make sure I framed everything accurately.

From his youth he was distinguished for his piety and his love for classical studies. He was especially proficient in philosophy, and so he was known as Sophronius the Wise. The future hierarch, however, sought the true philosophy of monasticism, and conversations with the desert-dwellers.\n\nHe arrived in Jerusalem at the monastery of Saint Theodosius, and there he became close with the hieromonk John Moschus, becoming his spiritual son and submitting himself to him in obedience. They visited several monasteries, writing down the lives and spiritual wisdom of the ascetics they met. From these notes emerged their renowned book, the *Leimonarion* or *Spiritual Meadow*, which was highly esteemed at the Seventh Ecumenical Council.\n\nTo save themselves from the devastating incursions of the Persians, Saints John and Sophronius left Palestine and went to Antioch, and from there they went to Egypt. In Egypt, Saint Sophronius became seriously ill. During this time he decided to become a monk and was tonsured by Saint John Moschus.\n\nAfter Saint Sophronius recovered his health, they both decided to remain in Alexandria. There they were received by the holy Patriarch John the Merciful (November 12), to whom they rendered great aid in the struggle against the Monophysite heresy. At Alexandria Saint Sophronius had an affliction of the eyes, and he turned with prayer and faith to the holy Unmercenaries Cyrus and John (January 31), and he received healing in a church named for them. In gratitude, Saint Sophronius then wrote the Lives of these holy Unmercenaries.\n\nWhen the barbarians began to threaten Alexandria, Patriarch John, accompanied by Saints Sophronius and John Moschus, set out for Constantinople, but he died along the way. Saints John Moschus and Sophronius then set out for Rome with eighteen other monks. Saint John Moschus died at Rome. His body was taken to Jerusalem by Saint Sophronius and buried at the monastery of Saint Theodosius.\n\nIn the year 628, Patriarch Zacharias of Jerusalem (609-633) returned from his captivity in Persia. After his death, the patriarchal throne was occupied for two years by Saint Modestus (December 18). After the death of Saint Modestus, Saint Sophronius was chosen Patriarch. Saint Sophronius toiled much for the welfare of the Jerusalem Church as its primate (634-644).\n\nToward the end of his life, Saint Sophronius and his flock lived through a two year siege of Jerusalem by the Moslems. Worn down by hunger, the Christians finally agreed to open the city gates, on the condition that the enemy spare the holy places. But this condition was not fulfilled, and Saint Sophronius died in grief over the desecration of the Christian holy places.\n\nWritten works by Patriarch Sophronius have come down to us in the area of dogmatics, and likewise his \u201cExcursus on the Liturgy,\u201d the Life of Saint Mary of Egypt (April 1), and also about 950 troparia and stikheras from Pascha to the Ascension.\n\nWhile still a hieromonk, Saint Sophronius reviewed and made corrections to the Rule of the monastery of Saint Savva the Sanctified (December 5). The saint\u2019s three Canons for the Holy Forty Day Great Fast are included in the contemporary Lenten Triodion.\n\n_____________\n\n*Troparion \u2014 Tone 5*\n\nPatriarch Sophronius, you were glorious in the splendor of sobriety, and through the radiance of your words you revealed ineffable enlightenment from heaven. For by your life you attained wisdom and now you confirm the Church as an illustrious hierarch and intercessor for us with the Lord.\n\n*Kontakion \u2014 Tone 8*\n\nYou were most wise among patriarchs, Sophronius of Jerusalem. You struggled with divine zeal, spreading the commandments of truth with your lips. You set right the foundations of the Church and firmly established the monastic order.

Not only was he our Lamb who was slain, but also he left us an example of how to suffer. Not only is he our Master, but also he is our model of how to live our life. That\u2019s why we are called Christians; our life is to reflect the life of Jesus.\n\nPaul tells us, \u201cBe imitators of Christ\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:1). Even our Savior says, \u201cLearn from me\u201d (Matthew 11:29). We learn from him not only how to live but also how to suffer. \n\nWhen talking about his suffering, Jesus compared himself to a seed that is planted by the farmer in the soil with the hope to produce a great harvest. What people saw as burial, Jesus viewed as planting. His death would result in a harvest of salvation for many. It\u2019s true that our suffering doesn\u2019t add to our salvation, but the way we go through our suffering can bring us closer to God.\n\nPlanting and burial may look alike, but they are different. Both seed and corpse go into the ground. One comes back as a forest, the other turns into dust. Sometimes our suffering may seem like the burial of our dreams and God\u2019s promises, but we must keep faith in him that we are being planted. We must trust in God\u2019s plan even if it feels like all of our life is part of the devil\u2019s plot. Our perspective during pain can\u2019t be trusted; therefore, we must trust in God\u2019s promise. During suffering our feelings can\u2019t be trusted either; we must look to our Father.\n\nJesus didn\u2019t downplay the reality of the cross, yet he had a positive outlook on the future. In fact, he always said that after suffering he would die and then rise again. I think it\u2019s important to keep a promise of God in front of our minds so that it gives us an optimistic outlook on life. We are not talking about merely being positive. When you\u2019re suffering, have an optimistic outlook that things will get better. That if it\u2019s Friday, Sunday is coming. Even if it\u2019s weeping right now, joy is coming in the morning.\n\nGod gave us the Holy Spirit to help us keep our heads up when things are hard. The Holy Spirit is called our Comforter. When all comforts fail, he will never fail us. Comforts can bring happiness, but only the Comforter brings joy. If suffering does one good thing, it is to make us rely more on the Comforter and less on our comforts. Jesus offered himself on the cross to the Father through the eternal Spirit. The Holy Spirit is there to help you when you\u2019re suffering. But as with Christ, the Spirit also raised him up after three days. So it is with us, the Holy Spirit will help us to rise again and overcome every obstacle.\n\nToday\u2019s Confession:\n1. I am not being buried; I am being planted. \n2. The Holy Spirit is my Comforter even when all my comforts fail.\n3. It might be Friday in my life, but Sunday is coming!\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/Um9hAuOMZ0g","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678574627.0},{"title":"Do Christian\u2019s typically believe Jesus is God?","author":"ghishle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11nyvi8\/do_christians_typically_believe_jesus_is_god\/","text":"Hello, I grew up christian but not with this concept.

My half-sister a few days ago was brutally murdered by her son a long with a few other family members. Her son also turned the gun on himself and killed himself. This has been very tough on the family as she was the families pillar and she was who brought everyone together. Luckily she was very spiritual and believed heavily in God and was the best person she could possibly be. We know or we had least hope she made it to heaven and I personally believe she did. She was the type of person to even forgive her own son that murdered her. Context aside, her full blood brother who was essentially like her best friend is going through it very heavily right now. On the day of the murder when he went to sleep he had a dream where he saw her glowing and looking beautiful and happy. He attempted to touch her but couldn't as she was surrounded by others. I think he also saw her in white. No one else in the family seemed to have a dream like this and what is interesting about this situation is that that specific brother was her favorite brother. They had a relationship like no other with the other brothers. So may be that's why she decided to \"show\" herself to him. Anyways, are experiences like these common? And do you think it's just a reaction of shock that caused such a \"dream\".","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678558753.0},{"title":"Is it hard to set our mind on things of heaven, when so much chaos is in this generation (earth) ?","author":"italia_crown","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11owjzs\/is_it_hard_to_set_our_mind_on_things_of_heaven\/","text":"This was our daily Bible verse, and I just wonder if Christians feel the same.

Then one by one, misfortunes piled onto her. \n\nFirst, she was born with one leg significantly shorter, and after walking around on her toes on one leg for fifty years, her hip bone was ground away and needed replaced. This made her bedridden for some time recovering, during which she put on a good bit of weight, which was detrimental to both her physical and emotional health. Then as soon as she recovered from that, she had a benign growth in her foot - when it was removed so was the fat pad on the ball of her foot, making walking painful. Then came the biggest scare of my life when she had a stroke - luckily there was no major damage, but it's something else to worry about. She also got an abdominal hernia - her guts are starting to poke out of her naval. Finally she somehow ended up with a  severely bulging disc in her back, which causes the most pain. Combined with her foot, she cant walk more than ten feet or stand for more than a few minutes without excruciating pain.\n\nShe won't look into surgery for her back, because everyone she's spoken to who has had similar surgery says they're just the same or worse off than before. She can't exercise to lose the excess weight because of all the pain, and she already eats like a bird. She cries every single day. It's heartbreaking to see my strong supermom in such awful shape. Yet through it all she has remained a steadfast Christian, attending church and teaching Sunday school every week. She is truly amazing.\n\nI pray for her every day, not expecting a complete reversal of her ailments - I have plenty of faith, but these days God doesn't just fix a broken body like poof - but praying for relief, for at least a little bit of the pain taken away. An actual angel on earth like my mother doesn't deserve this misery. I know this life is temporary, but it's hard to keep that in mind when every moment is agony. \n\nPlease lift my mother up in your prayers - she needs an army of prayer warriors. I want to hear her laugh again.","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678550597.0},{"title":"The Church of the East | David Bentley Hart","author":"Stainonstainlessteel","url":"https:\/\/www.firstthings.com\/web-exclusives\/2011\/01\/the-church-of-the-east","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678533895.0},{"title":"Tucker Carlson Calls Out Big Eva\u2019s Silence After Pastor\u2019s Arrest: \"Where Is David French, Beth Moore, and Tim Keller?\" \u00b7 Caldron Pool","author":"pjp196727","url":"https:\/\/caldronpool.com\/tucker-carlson-calls-out-big-evas-silence-after-pastors-arrest-where-is-david-french-beth-moore-and-tim-keller\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.25,"created_utc":1678602953.0},{"title":"Welcome to the Tribulation Podcast! -the Advocate","author":"hencehuman","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLP92xRBrn6kSZHrSS-xixWNKKtCAbRQlX","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678571253.0},{"title":"Have i done something wrong?","author":"aptikkytokky","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11ow3cc\/have_i_done_something_wrong\/","text":"i am new to christianity, and have lived in a non religious househould all my life. considering all the things im seeing on social media about end times i have felt concerned about what might happen to my family if it was to occur, i was praying for forgiveness for there sins by god,midway through my prayer i started thinking intrusive thoughts which i denied in the name of jesus christ and after i finished ive been feeling really lightheaded and have a bad headache. is this something i have done wrong?","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678571172.0},{"title":"Bible verse.","author":"Imaginary-Gate7754","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11ojnl5\/bible_verse\/","text":"Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth.\r\nColossians 3:2 NLT.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678539706.0},{"title":"How Should Christians Live? Exploring the Cultural Lifestyle Expected of Believers","author":"DimensionUnable1226","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11ow2ia\/how_should_christians_live_exploring_the_cultural\/","text":"This project explores the importance of living out our faith through compassionate action. Today, we will look at a community of believers who stood up and took action in the face of poverty, inequality, and injustice. They lived out their faith by advocating for the vulnerable and oppressed, protecting the planet, welcoming strangers, and fighting for justice and mercy. Their example shows us that faith isn't just a set of beliefs but a way of life that inspires us to make a difference in the world. So, let's dive in and learn from their example.\n\n\"Once upon a time, a community of believers lived in a world plagued by poverty and inequality. They gathered in a small church, singing hymns and praying, believing that all people were created in God's image and deserved to be treated with dignity and respect. They made it their priority to be generous to the poor and marginalized, and they showed genuine care and compassion to those in need.\n\nAs they continued to live out their faith, they became aware of the atrocities of human trafficking and slavery happening worldwide. Their hearts were heavy as they learned about the vulnerable and oppressed who were being exploited. They knew that as Christians, they were called to protect the weak and fight against these modern-day forms of slavery. So, they took up the cause, advocating for policies and practices to help end human trafficking and slavery.\n\nBut they didn't stop there. They also realized that the Earth was the Lord's and that they were called to be good stewards of the planet. They knew that environmental sustainability was a crucial part of their faith, and they worked hard to promote policies and practices that would help protect the Earth and its inhabitants.\n\nAs they grew in their faith, they became increasingly aware of the plight of immigrants and refugees. They remembered the biblical teachings about welcoming strangers and foreigners and treating them with kindness and hospitality. So, they supported policies that promoted the compassionate treatment of immigrants and refugees.\n\nFinally, the community of believers turned their attention to criminal justice reform. They knew the Bible emphasized justice and mercy and advocated restoring relationships and communities. So, they engaged in efforts to promote restorative justice, reduce mass incarceration, and support rehabilitation programs for offenders.\n\nThrough it all, the community of believers remained steadfast in their faith, following the biblical teachings and striving to live out God's love and compassion in the world. Their example inspires us to take action, show kindness and compassion to those in need, care for the Earth, welcome strangers, and fight for justice and mercy.\"\n\nIn a world that can often seem dark and hopeless, the community of believers reminds us that there is always hope. We can make a difference by working together, living out our faith, and showing love and compassion. So, let us follow their example and let our faith inspire us to act.\n\nThese verses show that the community of believers in the story is following the model of scripture by prioritizing values such as compassion, justice, mercy, stewardship, and hospitality, which are emphasized throughout the Bible.\n\n\"And God created man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\" (Genesis 1:27). This verse shows that all people are created in God's image and deserve dignity and respect.\n\n\"But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have the need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?\" (1 John 3:17) This verse encourages generosity and compassion toward those in need, which the community of believers in your story exemplifies.\n\n\"He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" (Micah 6:8) This verse highlights the importance of justice and mercy, which the community of believers in your story prioritize through their advocacy for criminal justice reform and restorative justice.\n\n\"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.\" (Psalm 24:1). This verse emphasizes the community of believers' belief in environmental sustainability and their responsibility to care for the planet as good stewards.\n\n\"But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.\" (Leviticus 19:34) This verse supports the community of believers' advocacy for compassionate treatment of immigrants and refugees and their commitment to welcoming strangers.\n\n\"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, since ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" (Matthew 25:37-40) This passage reinforces the idea that caring for others, especially those in need, is a fundamental part of living out one's faith, as the community of believers in your story demonstrates.\n\nDear God,\n\nWe come to you today with heavy hearts, burdened by the suffering and injustice we see in the world. We know that you call us to love one another and to act with compassion towards all, but sometimes it can be hard to know where to begin.\n\nToday, we ask you to guide us, to give us the strength and courage to be agents of change in the world. Help us to see the needs of those around us and to respond with kindness, generosity, and love.\n\nPlease give us the wisdom to know what actions to take and the perseverance to see them through. Help us to be steadfast in our commitment to your kingdom, to seek justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with you.\n\nWe know that we are not alone in this work. We are part of a community of believers who share our passion for justice and compassion. Together, we can make a difference, standing up for the vulnerable and oppressed, protecting the planet, welcoming strangers, and fighting for justice and mercy.\n\nSo, we ask you to bless our efforts to use us as your instruments in the world. We pray that our actions will be a reflection of your love and compassion, that they will bring hope to those who are struggling, and that they will be a testimony to your power and grace.\n\nIn your holy name, we pray.\n\nAmen.\n\nThank you for joining us on this journey through the importance of living out our faith through compassionate action. We hope that the example of this community of believers has inspired you to take action, show kindness and compassion to those in need, care for the Earth, welcome strangers, and fight for justice and mercy. Remember, our faith calls us to love one another and act compassionately towards all. So, let us go forth and live out our faith in the world, positively impacting the lives of those around us.

So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son. **He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins.** He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.\n\nGod has now revealed to us his mysterious will regarding Christ\u2014which is to fulfill his own good plan. And this is the plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ\u2014everything in heaven and on earth. Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for he chose us in advance, and he makes everything work out according to his plan.\n\nGod's purpose was that we Jews who were the first to trust in Christ would bring praise and glory to God. And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, **the Good News that God saves you.** And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago. The Spirit is God's guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. He did this so we would praise and glorify him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nThere is a process by which one becomes a true Christian. We start with a mustard seed of faith, allowing our faith to grow as the Holy Spirit works in our lives. We do this not on our own but from the \"Helper,\" the Holy Spirit.\n\nHe is the One who helps us to mature in our walk of the Christian life, making all things NEW, helping us to transform, removing our old way of life (we are all sinful creatures), putting on the new life, and making every effort to become a new being.\n\nWhen we fail, don't dismay, The Comforter and Helper will always encourage us to keep going until we reach the finish line.\n\n(Romans 8:1) There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, **who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.**","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678537483.0},{"title":"I was possessed by a demonic entity","author":"phobia78","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11p18b4\/i_was_possessed_by_a_demonic_entity\/","text":"this is going to sound really fake and made up, but i swear i\u2019m telling the truth. i don\u2019t really care if nobody believes me, as i know my own body and experiences. \n\nthis happened today. i went out to get food and as i was walking to the place, for some reason, i started to feel strange. it was like a disconnection from my mind and body, like i wasn\u2019t in control of anything. my thoughts were not my own and i couldn\u2019t fully control my body the way i wanted to. it was like i was aware of what i was thinking and doing, but i didn\u2019t have the strength to stop it. \n\nas it controlled my body, it made me start walking to random places i\u2019ve never been before and i ended up getting lost somewhere unfamiliar. i knew i was going the wrong way, but i just kept going for some reason and i didn\u2019t stop it. \n\nas it controlled my mind, it made me feel hate and rage that i\u2019ve never felt before. it was so intense and indescribable that it sometimes made me feel nauseous. i hated every single person i looked at. it wasn\u2019t like i hated them all in general, i had this infinite hate for each person individually. i have no idea why, i\u2019ve never felt like that before. i could feel myself glaring at people, i tried to stop doing it but i had absolutely no control. \n\nit also made me hate the area i was in. it forced me to have visions of the city if i was on fire, bombed and post-apocalyptic looking and made it clear that i was the one who had done it. i don\u2019t know how i knew this, and i don\u2019t know how i did it in this made up scenario but somehow i did. \n\ni think i may have been possessed by a demonic entity. similar things have happened to me before, but never this severe. i have been possessed before, but it was mentally and not physically. it was terrifying to be moving and thinking on autopilot and not being able to do anything about it. \n\nas this was happening to me, i was praying, both in my head and out loud. it made me feel safer, but it didn\u2019t stop the possession. i\u2019m going to look for an exorcist in my area \n\ni wish i could explain things better, i\u2019m sorry. i tried to explain things as clearly as i could","upvote_ratio":0.29,"created_utc":1678583943.0},{"title":"Online study partners?","author":"Stefania_a","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11orz82\/online_study_partners\/","text":"   Hey!

We are not living in this world without desires and wants. There are always grief and joy regarding life, and sadness is always inevitable. \n\nWhen a person is extremely sad, even every breath is sorrowful. Men do not easily shed tears unless they are deeply grieved.\n\nIf a person is frequently sad and in grief, or even falls into it and cannot extricate themselves, their life will be sad. The beginning of the depression mostly starts from being unable to get out of sadness. \n\nMany people get out of the pain of sadness, not by their own strength or the comfort of others, but by healing over a long period of time. But life is short; it will be even more heartbreaking if our precious time is always in sorrow. \n\nSadness is inevitable. However, those who are sad have the fortune of being able to seek God easily. A merciful God cannot help but comfort the brokenhearted, and as the Bible says, 'the Lord is close to the brokenhearted.'

The Episcopal Church and Church of England are more progressive than what the members of the ACNA are comfortable with.

Irish Spring bar soap, now I smell like an Irish Waterfall. And of course conditioner. A place to escape and start over. So comforting, that light. \n\nWrong lol. It's just a temporary solution to a reoccurring reality. When I've shared with people in this sub that I have a mental disability, reoccurring affliction, basically the first conclusion is that I'm depressed. That's what the issue is. Makes sense and even to me, but explain that to God. When he knows where I'm at and what's going on. Ask him why he did not comfort me in the shower when I reached out. Did not hear my plea. Did not give me words to share which were of benefit to others. \n\nThere's quite a few people in this town who's lives would perhaps be turned around, in a way, if they had fake candle lit shower every night. For whatever reason, it's just a temporary washaway for me. These blessings in my life, the things which should make me grateful. I am, but there's still tomorrow morning to consider. \n\nIt's difficult. Like a kid who doesn't want to go to school but instead a grownup of sorts who just wants to go back to sleep, forever. There's something very real in that moment when my eyes open. Fresh start of...there's just something not right. Like I'm a robot rebooting and for a short while it's this nooooo, I will not return to the system not today, today is the day.....be late for work if I don't just get going. \n\nSo it's not depression, it's....normal. The distractions of my daily routine remove it, go into work and everything is fine. My coworker and I are going to exchange books for our upcoming birthdays she mentioned that she's a Ray Bradbury fan so I'm getting his memoir on writing and she's buying me a book of his I've not read. Haven't read any of his books, but a while back I started reading his memoir. Fair trade, she likes to write. So it doesn't really follow me into work. Or the shower. Just when alone. And God is not really filling this spot in my life. Or Jesus. Nor the Holy Spirit. \n\nI'm not really sure what to do about this. There does not seem to be a fix for it, and mostly because nothing really feels broken. Pretty real thing, not to be smothered out or medicated. No verse from the Bible or self help book will get through, anything really. It's just here. But it's also nothing, but for certain not nothing as well. Quite strange and for a couple years now. \n\nHad a very good dinner, something millions of people did not have today. Forrest Gump was on the TV while I was eating. It's a sad ending, thoughtful one, but at Jenny's grave he's just talking to her and comments that he's not sure if we all have a destiny or were just blowing around in the breeze, perhaps for not much of a reason. His final thought on that was maybe it's a combination of both. Can't say that I know either. \n\nIt's not a positive message by any means, but I'm pretty happy that life doesn't last forever. It's the only thing I know for certain to be a fact. Has a comforting effect, being aware of that. Some day this will all be over and I'm not really wondering what's after this anymore. So that's a nice barrier to move on from. \n\nWhat does tomorrow morning bring? Only God knows, I guess. That's if I believe God is real tonight.

He warned that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could lead to more bloodshed and greater escalation, and he made a chilling prediction: \u201cI fear the world is not sleepwalking into a wider war. I fear it is doing so with its eyes wide open.\u201d Mr. Guterres also claimed that the world needs a new approach to peace that involves a return to the UN\u2019s charter\u2014putting human rights and dignity first and foremost.\n\nAlthough human rights and dignity are very important, a return to any humanly devised set of rules\u2014no matter how noble or well-intentioned\u2014will not result in world peace. Humanity has sought peace for millennia, only to fall woefully short, time after time. The Bible teaches, \u201cThere is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death\u201d ([Proverbs 14:12](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/nkjv\/Prov%2014.12)) and proclaims that human beings simply do not know the way to peace ([Isaiah 59:8](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/nkjv\/Isa%2059.8)). Try as we may, humanity left to itself will not find lasting peace, because that attempt will be predicated on flawed laws and statutes that are unable to fundamentally transform human nature. The real key to lasting peace will be the return of the Prince of Peace ([Isaiah 9:6\u20137](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/nkjv\/Isa%209.6%E2%80%937)), who will restore God\u2019s law and statutes\u2014the \u201cperfect law of liberty\u201d ([James 1:25](https:\/\/biblia.com\/bible\/nkjv\/James%201.25)).

Anymore it's just a really cool and dimming bedside bulb lamp. Kinda weird waking up to monkey songs after a while. \n\nA coffee press because they produce better coffee than any grind n' drip machine. Forgot about that thing, the press. Man it just tastes so much better. \n\nMight be nice to somehow change my scenery. About the only thing I can do right now is take my monkey lamp and coffee press into an imaginary jungle of sorts. Maybe some campsite on a hillside overlooking Monkey Song Valley. Cackling small fire with a cast iron kettle heating up water. Somehow I've managed to bring along an infinite supply of decaff coarse ground coffee with me so I can do this every day. \n\nSounds nice. From a fantasy perspective at least. Kind of like living somewhere in the northwest. Stereotypical overcast days that feel like a giant gray and comforting blankie in the sky. Drizzly days on a porch with pressed coffee and those NW rainforest monkeys doing thier thing. They live by the hot springs and take refuge and song away under the 10' tall mushrooms. I guess that I can do whatever I want to, with my imagination.\n\nNope. Not anymore, according to some Christians. The fact that I'm imagining monkeys thriving in a community somewhere outside of Seattle is a no-no. It's fantasy, highly fictional and has nothing to do with what God created. But I like doing these things. It's fun in It's own way. And there's only so much I can write about God, especially when I'm supposed to get to know him and he's kinda in the background and being cryptic. Distant, vague. I'm sure people would say he's not vague, go find him in the Bible. I've read it almost twice and who knows how many times I've read a book and epistle here and there. \n\nWith all that said, I cannot seek God from the refuge of a giant mushroom. Sit with a few NW monkeys as we look out over the valley during a massive thunderstorm. It's about the best thing in the world to me, the sight of falling rain and bolting lightning, sound of thunder, smell of ozone, everything about it. Otherwise it's just me in the parking lot at work once again. Listening to and feeling the wind blow through my open window. Seeing the same mountains covered in the same snow. Same ol' sounds of traffic same everything. Then the same click-click chunka-chunks of what's inside the building of absolute routine. As I watch every possible form of fantasy and spirituality and religion and self help book pass through my hands. \n\nI'm not sure what to do to change any of this. If somehow figuring out how to relocate to a different city than the one I've lived in my entire life would change my perspective on things. Or if I'd wake up and imagine these mountains again, get tired of the NW and long to visit my Yeti friend at treeline. Enjoy a cup of pressed Joe together by a small fire while in his cave. Watch the snow fall down and just chuckle at those silly giant mushroom worshipping mushrooms. Don't they know? You're supposed to worship the creator and not the creation. \n\nEither way, something needs to change. Was hoping God could wave his supernatural wand, that wand of not coincidence, just something.

Today I\u2019m continuing the most important lesson ever. Many say that Yeshua abolished the Mosaic Law, and that the Old Testament is long gone and obsolete. Is the Law and the Prophets abolished? Let\u2019s put the some of the writings of the New Testament to the test of the Law and the Prophets.\n\n[Last week](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VeganNazarite\/comments\/115o7la\/lets_put_it_to_the_test_galatians_part_4\/) we learned that Paul declares to us a parable in the Torah. That Jerusalem of the earth is from Hagar, and that the Jerusalem of the heavens is from Sarah. He also declares that Ishmael was the child of bondage to the world (which is sin) and that Isaac was the child of promise from Yah to His people. He also declares that believers of the gospel, are, like Isaac, children of the promises of Yahweh. He then ends his explanation that the false brothers and sisters, should be cast out of the assembly of Galatia because they are still in bondage to the things of men and the world. In this affirmation, Paul as in his other epistles, teaches the Galatians to remove the sin from their midst, and to continue being separate from the world and its sinful contents.\n\nAgain, we can see that looking at the New Testament writings with the lens of the Torah, that the verses become clearer and there are no contradictions. Here is the score far:\n\nThe Torah: 7\n\nDoctrines of Devils: 0\n\nLet\u2019s keep sharpening our proverbial spears and swords, which is the Word. WMC no. 7 is Galatians 4:21-31. In those verses Paul uses the story of Hagar and Sarah, and their sons from Genesis in the Torah and quotes from the prophet Isaiah to illustrate his point that the Jerusalem of the earth keeps its children under man-made laws and that Jerusalem of the heavens sets believers of the gospel free from those man-made rules. Another thing we can see is that the Jerusalem of the earth has taken over the Torah and uses corrupt and sinful men who are trying to keep the faithful to Yahweh under their own rules (or bondage). Let\u2019s continue and see what other treasures we can find. Let\u2019s restart at Chapter 5. You may want to read Galatians chapter 5 for a refresh.\n\nGalatians chapter 5:1-6\n\n*\\[1\\] Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. \\[2\\] Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. \\[3\\] For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. \\[4\\] Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. \\[5\\] For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. \\[6\\] For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.*\n\nIn verse 1 Paul reminds the Galatians to return to the liberty that Yeshua called us to. A few weeks ago we learned that Yeshua tells his disciples to \u201c[Do what they say, but not do what they do.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VeganNazarite\/comments\/10hvis0\/lets_put_it_to_the_test_colossians_chapter_21416\/)\u201d Paul is reminding the Galatian of Yeshua\u2019s command to do the Torah, but not the traditions of men, because those traditions have nothing to do with God\u2019s ordained Torah, but rather for sinful men to justify themselves to other men and women. Then in the next verse he re-affirms that if they get circumcised under the laws of the Pharisees and the scribes, they will then be obligated to follow all the other useless commands of the Pharisees and the scribes. We see this in verse 4: who has fallen from grace? He answers in the same verse that its \u201cwhosoever of you are justified by the law\u201d. By believers wanting to justify themselves to other men and women (by seeking praise and attention to their actions whether from the Torah or the laws of the Pharisees), they have abandoned God\u2019s ways and have nullified the teachings of the messiah. As believers with the spirit of Yahweh, our mantra is \u201cfaith which works by love.\u201d What does this mean? It means that our faith in Father (and messiah), by believing the promises that He gave us through the Law and the prophets, and our love for Him as the creator of all things, will empower us to do the commands of the Torah, so that ourselves and our assemblies will be edified with greater gifts and even greater faith. I can personally testify to this. Every time I accepted a command from the Torah, I received a significant blessing from observing it; that\u2019s justification from the Father. And that in turn, increased my personal faith in messiah and Father.\n\nGalatians chapter 5:7-10\n\n*\\[7\\] Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? \\[8\\] This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. \\[9\\] A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. \\[10\\] I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.*\n\nThen in verses 5:7-10 Paul reminds them to again return to the teachings of Yeshua and affirms that all this justification of the deeds of the Law to other men and women is not from Yeshua, but rather is from leaven (or sin) and that this leaven will eventually turn the whole congregation to sin. He then states that he has faith that that won\u2019t be the case, but that the ones that trouble them will be held to account. What teaching from Yeshua is Paul referring to? Let\u2019s go to the words of Yeshua at Matt 16:8\u201112.\n\n*\\[8\\] Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? \\[9\\] Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? \\[10\\] Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?* ***\\[11\\] How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? \\[12\\] Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.***\n\nWell what was the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees? They were the kings of vain worship and justifying themselves to other men and women by obeying the commands, but had forgotten why they were doing them. They weren\u2019t doing the commands to honor God, but rather themselves!\n\nGalatians chapter 5:11\n\n***\\[11\\] And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.*** *\\[12\\] I would they were even cut off which trouble you.*\n\nWell, what is this? Am I reading this correct? Paul is admitting that even himself preaches circumcision! That doesn\u2019t sound like abolishing circumcision at all. Why then is he being persecuted by the other Jews? That answer is easy. Paul preached the circumcision as defined in the Torah at Genesis 17:10-14. Nothing more, nothing less. That circumcision has no added laws and traditions from the scribes and Pharisees. What\u2019s the offence of the cross then? Yeshua preached the Torah, without the added traditions of men, and the Pharisees and the scribes preached another torah, one with commandments of men. John\u2019s gospel also says the same thing in John 12:42-43:\n\n*\\[42\\] Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: \\[43\\]* ***For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.***\n\nWe can see that the ones who love the praises of men, rather than Father, these are in the synagogues and the churches because they love themselves more than the Creator. They feared the Pharisees and their threats of being thrown out of the synagogue, because they would lose the praise of men, rather than admitting that they followed Yeshua. They are in the synagogues and the churches for the wrong reason, for what they can get from the churches and synagogues rather than for the love of the Father and our master Yeshua.\n\nThen Paul, in verse 12 tells the Galatians that those who use God\u2019s commands to justify themselves should be banished from the congregation. Again, we see that Paul preaches the same as Yeshua: The Torah without the traditions of men.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the command of circumcision:\n\nGenesis chapter 17:10-14\n\n*\\[10\\] This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. \\[11\\] And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. \\[12\\] And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. \\[13\\] He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. \\[14\\] And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.*\n\nThose are the commands from Yahweh to Abraham. And Abraham is righteous because he believed God, through faith that God would honor his covenant as He said He would. Abraham the day he received that command circumcised himself, and all the men, including his slaves that very day. That\u2019s the great faith that Abraham had. He believed God\u2019s promise and circumcised all the men of his family and his slaves. It's interesting to me that these verses are exactly from the same chapter in the Torah that Paul quotes from in the previous chapter with the parable of Hagar, Sarah and their sons. HalleluYAH!\n\nWithout faith in the promises that God gave Abraham, then all the circumcisions done when he received the command from God would have been in vain! That\u2019s the circumcision that Paul is preaching. HalleluYAH!\n\nNext week we will restart at chapter 5:14.\n\nDon\u2019t take it from me! Prove all things and judge for yourself. Let the spirit lead you where it wants you to be.\n\nYeshua is our master, savior and rabbi, we need no other man to lead us!\n\nShalom, VN","upvote_ratio":0.29,"created_utc":1678553981.0},{"title":"god deosnt not condemn people","author":"Most_Satisfaction292","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11oucgs\/god_deosnt_not_condemn_people\/","text":"People condemn people or they condemn themselves every god did was to help u be happy.... remember that..........","upvote_ratio":0.36,"created_utc":1678566877.0},{"title":"here is a question I've never seen on this forum","author":"Most_Satisfaction292","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11p0jn8\/here_is_a_question_ive_never_seen_on_this_forum\/","text":"What if Jesus was bisexual ...

I went to their AWANA club, their summer camp, and when I became old enough, their tween and teen youth group. My parents went to church too, but not one that tended to be very theologically dense\u2014they preached out of basically these religious self-help books. I wanted something deeper and more Biblically based, so I ended up going to church at this church sometimes too. \n\nI was a victim of incestuous sexual abuse from both parents from babyhood on. I was homeschooled to make sure people wouldn\u2019t find out. When I was a teenager I finally told someone what was going on, and I ended up in foster care. Because of the shortage of foster homes in my area, I was put in a homeless shelter at first. While all this was going down I stopped going to church. I was ashamed of what had happened to me. I missed god, though, and I missed youth group. Church had been the only positive, safe place in my life up to that point. I asked most of the questions after every little \u201csermon\u201d our youth pastor Keegan gave. It was my only real social contact while I was homeschooled, and Keegan was the only adult in my life who was ever kind to me. I didn\u2019t ever get Christmas or birthday gifts, so a little toy puzzle game Keegan gave to me was the first gift I\u2019d ever received. I really valued Keegan\u2019s opinion on things and respected him as a person. I also just had a lot of fun at youth group\u2014we played games in the church (I especially loved Mafia), we\u2019d sometimes go bowling or sledding, there were snacks (which meant a lot because my parents kept me very very hungry), and it was time to be around friendly kids my own age. \n\nEventually, about six months after I was removed from my home, even though I was nervous about it I contacted one of the youth group leaders and asked for a ride to church for youth group. They picked me up from the group home I was living in, and I awkwardly told them about adjusting to high school for the first time and how I\u2019d joined my school\u2019s French club. Youth group was as awkward as I expected\u2014people had obviously gossiped or speculated about what had happened, and some girls asked me if there was \u201ctrouble at home.\u201d I was texting on my phone a lot to escape the awkwardness. But I had fun playing the games, and it felt so good to be back at church again. When I was taken into care I lost absolutely everything. All my clothes came from a charity \u201cfoster closet\u201d, and a bunch of strange social workers suddenly decided everything about my life. I thought youth group might get to be the one thing I could keep, the one thing in my life that was staying the same. Living in a cold institutional group home, where staff are paid by the hour and none of them really care about you, was really hard. I thought church would be a way I could have some interactions with warm and caring adults who values me as a person and a child of god. \n\nThat was until the next Saturday. I texted Keegan to ask for a ride home from youth group that week. He texted back that he\u2019d spoken with the other youth leaders and the church\u2019s elders and they\u2019d decided I wasn\u2019t welcome at youth group anymore. I was told I could still come to adult Bible study if I wanted (I\u2019d never been.) \n\nBeing excluded from youth group is one of the most hurtful things that\u2019s ever happened to me, and I\u2019ve gone over and over it in my mind to try to understand why. Was it because of the sexual abuse? Were they scared I\u2019d say something about it to someone at youth group? (I didn\u2019t mention it and wouldn\u2019t have\u2014I found it humiliating to think or talk about.) That it would scare or confuse the other youth? Did they think I had sinned too, by staying silent? \n\nOr maybe it was something else. I happen to be homosexual (unrelated to the abuse.) I have been celibate and chaste in thought, word, and deed for my entire life. I wasn\u2019t out at the time, and had never told anyone about this aspect of myself, but I\u2019ve often wondered if they suspected it and kicked me out because of that. I\u2019ve been told I have a gay demeanour.\n\nI felt tainted when I was kicked out, like I was perceived as a threat to the other children. I truly cannot think of any other reason, besides the two I mentioned, for being kicked out of youth group. I wondered if it was my age, but the group had had members who were older than me. I don\u2019t think it was my behaviour\u2014I was a very timid young person and didn\u2019t tend to cause trouble. I did once swear jokingly at another kid (a very close friend outside of youth group), but that was over a year prior and the only \u201cmisbehaviour\u201d I can think of. \n\nIn foster care, your connections with other people are constantly being severed. I\u2019d grow close to a social worker only for them to leave the job (I had twelve social workers in one calendar year), bond with a foster parent only to be moved to another home. Losing my connection with the adults who had been in my life the longest was an additional blow. I still think about it regularly, years later. I guess I\u2019m writing this to caution youth leaders that you never know the impact you might have in someone\u2019s life.\n\nI often think about how the Bible says that \u201creligion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress.\u201d Imagine if someone from my church of many years had stepped up to foster or adopt (I was waiting for adoption) me, or had made a special effort to be a friend or mentor to me while I lived in group homes, to come to my school concert or sports games, things like that. Other people did step up, but none of them were Christian. \n\nInstead I was rejected from my community at a time when I needed them the most, possibly because of untrue stereotypes about abuse victims or to avoid difficult conversations about what had happened to me. \n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience of being excluded from a church or youth group? \n\nAnd whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me. If anyone causes one of these little ones\u2014those who believe in me\u2014to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. -Matthew 18:5-6, NIV","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678493430.0},{"title":"How do I grow my relationship with god?","author":"Nowaybrobro","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11ob9es\/how_do_i_grow_my_relationship_with_god\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678510846.0},{"title":"I have a concern","author":"Psychological_Top365","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11o9o6k\/i_have_a_concern\/","text":"Hey guys, so a question for me, so if you have thought like: god won\u2019t help, or something like that, that is unfaithful, yet you realize that god can do it.

What is most important to him, is that more people know about Jesus and trust that he died to save us from Hell and, as a result, live forever in heaven with Him. Because of this commercial, millions of people are still talking about Jesus long after the commercial aired.

Nevertheless, the Georgian nation continues to be illumined by its grace and the radiance of the Georgian faithful who labored there.\n\nA contemporary of King Bagrat III (975-1014), Saint [John](https:\/\/images.oca.org\/icons\/sm\/march\/0310john-khakhuli0020.jpg) of Khakhuli was a highly educated theologian, translator, and calligrapher. He has been called \u201cChrysostom\u201d since he, like the beloved archbishop of Constantinople, delivered his sermons with extraordinary eloquence.\n\nSome sources claim that Saint John was first consecrated bishop of Bolnisi and later transferred to the Khakhuli diocese. It is generally agreed, however, that he left Khakhuli around the year 1019 and traveled to Mt. Athos with Arsen of Ninotsminda and John Grdzelisdze.\n\nOne Georgian manuscript, however, suggests that Saint John was not a bishop at that time, and this has baffled Church historians to this day. In this manuscript it is written: \u201cPray for the blessed monk John Grdzelisdze and his spiritual son John Chrysostom, who labored to write this holy book.\u201d\n\nWhile laboring on Mt. Athos, Saint John faithfully assisted Saint Ekvtime of the Holy Mountain, and these spiritual brothers became close friends.\n\nThe countless good works he performed from the bishop\u2019s throne, the title \u201cChrysostom,\u201d and the many important writings accredited to him attest to the piety, wisdom, and patriotism of Saint John of Khakhuli.

Now my cousin is known for being a thief, he stole $10,000 from my grandmother and $1800 from his best friend. So when I decided it was time for him to leave, I took him out to eat so my wife can look through his stuff.

She had told me what she saw on the iPad. I was now scared and frightened too. Did he do this in my house? Did she go through his emails or something and find this out now ? My wife and I after my cousin left immediately left our house, not feeling safe there whatsoever. \n\nSo my wife were so uncomfortable and scared we didn\u2019t want to return back to the house\u2026 comment coming in a moment because my phone slows down ridiculously when I make a thread","upvote_ratio":0.11,"created_utc":1678556005.0},{"title":"Are you the wheat or the darnel?","author":"oneryarlys68","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11ogyww\/are_you_the_wheat_or_the_darnel\/","text":"\n\nMany people think they are the wheat, but in fact they are the darnel. \nRead your Bible, Love God with all your heart, soul, and mind, and open your eyes and ears.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678531015.0},{"title":"Should Christian\u2019s visit gore sites.","author":"nicki2055","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11od65h\/should_christians_visit_gore_sites\/","text":"You know watching isis and cartel execution, I use to watch them but I question that maybe watching that stuff is in fact a sin and maybe disrespectful and most people who visit gore sites are the nastiest atheists you can meet.

We started out as close friends but soon became much more than friends. When we first got together she was so amazing. She was and still is the prettiest girl I've seen, she was kind, sweet, caring, funny, smart. I loved her so much and wanted to give her the world. She had been abused both emotionally and sexually by her ex boyfriend so I made sure that our relationship was nothing less than the most amazing, loving relationship I could give her. \n\nI did everything for this girl. I would sleep on facetime with her when we weren't together because she said she felt alone, I would write her letters telling her just how special she was to me, \nIgnored anyone who tried to flirt with me for her, posted her all over my socials, told my friends and family about how great she was and how I couldn't wait to marry her, spoiled her, comfort her whenever she was sad and treated her as best as I could. I gave her the exact opposite of what her ex gave her and I made sure there wasn't even a second where she didn't feel loved or special. She told me I was the best guy she ever had and only wanted me (this turned out to be very ironic).\n\nA few months in she moved to a different country for college as she wanted to be closer to her family and friends yet we both promised we'd visit each other and wouldn't let it ruin our relationship. We stayed just as close for a few months until one of her new friends from college started to make moves on her. He would go into her dorm room all the time, got very flirty and even told her friends how pretty she was and begged them to set both my girlfriend and him up with each other. He had a girlfriend but they didn't seem to bother him as he soon left her for no reason at all other than to just have a chance with my girlfriend at the time.\n\nIt made me really uncomfortable, I asked her to consider spending less time with him and stop letting him cross so many boundaries. I also asked her to tell him that she was already with someone but she refused as he \"wasn't her type at all\" and I have nothing to worry about especially since I was \"the only guy she loves and the only one she wants\". I was naive and allowed myself to be blinded by the acceptance she gave me. The whole time this was happening I was working extra shifts at the job I hate just to go and visit her on her birthday in January. I was even learning Spanish as she wanted me to meet her family and I even was considering moving there at some point in the future with her. I did everything for this girl. \n\nWeeks later she starts getting distant, and very cold. We barely called and not because she was busy with college but because she was out partying with friends... including the guy who she claimed she had no feelings for. \n\nWe'd call for like 10 minutes a day at most and whenever I would say \"I love you\" all I'd get back was an unenthusiastic, uninterested and almost disgusted \"me too\". This broke me to hear over and over again. I asked her why she refused to say she loved me too and she got mad at me saying it meant the same thing and I needed to stop being so insecure. I told her it was worrying because she was spending more and more time with the guy I mentioned and letting him constantly cross boundaries and still wouldn't tell him she had a boyfriend and also turned off her location whenever she went out with him (we had each others location at all times because she insisted that she wanted to be able to know i was safe and for me to know that she was). She said that I needed to trust her since if we didn't have trust we couldn't be together. Like an idiot I decided to trust her and it didn't take long for her to break that trust.\n\nA week goes by and she suddenly becomes very close again. She tells me how excited she is to marry me, travel the world with me, have kids with me, how much she \"loves\" me, etc - all of which I now believe to be lies. I was so happy because I thought that I had that sweet, loving caring girl I fell in love with back. I was wrong, she wasnt back.\n\nAbout a week or two after that, she says we need to talk. She calls me and tells me that she hasn't had any feelings for me for 4 months and that she had found someone else. This broke me to hear and it still hurts to even think about. I struggled to speak but finally managed to form a sentence and asked her who it was. She refused to tell me \"for my own mental health\". I told her to just stop hiding things from me for once and to be honest with me. It was the guy she told me I wouldn't have to worry about. She also told me that she \"went crazy\" with other guys a few days before. I couldn't fight the tears and I don't even remember what I said to her after but the call hung ended shortly after. She told me to \"take care\" of myself which annoyed me to hear because she didn't really care about me or my feelings.\n\nIt still hurts so badly to this day. It hurts that she could tell me all those nice things then break my heart the next week. It hurts that I did all those things for her and treated her amazingly and still got hurt by her and thrown away for a guy who would likely leave her the second he found someone he deemed more attractive like he did with his ex girlfriend. I still have the letter I wrote for her and the gifts I was going to give her on her birthday in my drawer which I haven't opened since.\n\nI've tried so hard to move on but I just can't. I would love to find someone else who would truly love me but i don't think I can. I'm still so confused by what it is he had that I didn't. \n\nThe worst feeling of all is the fact that if my absolute best wasn't enough for a girl who had never been shown proper love before and had nothing but bad experiences before me, how will I ever be enough for anyone else?\n\nI've been praying and trying to get closer to God but I'm still in so much pain. I'll never give up on Him just like He has never given up on me but I'm so hurt and I could just use some advice and some scripture that may help me.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678493797.0},{"title":"Prayer Requests","author":"AJBLAEC","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11o87ro\/prayer_requests\/","text":"Hi everyone I'm doing a prayer session tonight does anyone have any prayer requests you want me to pray on?

My father was and still is a Catholic. We would go to church on Sundays until I begged for us to stop. I was a young kid who loved sports so seeing my dad only on the weekends you can imagine I wanted to play all day, not sit. I dealt with a lot of family trauma growing up, on the outside I was doing phenomenal. Internally I was suffering. I had graduated high school and was forced out of our small apartment for my mothers abusive boyfriend. Homeless, driving an hour a day to community college, and couldn\u2019t pursue athletic endeavors due to grades. In the time period I managed to get arrested for speeding (I was late for a final, and truly thank god I didn\u2019t harm anyone). Afterward my mugshot was posted on local news. Additionally I lost a best friend at 17 due to an accident and I saw him daily as he was in a medically induced coma for a month. There I was, basically homeless, broke, struggling, and without much in life. Through all that, which now as a grown man I realize doesn\u2019t compare to other\u2019s strife. I never lost hope and I stand here today as a former college athlete, a current coach, husband, and a mentor to students that I teach and I get a chance to spread love\/care each and everyday. This past year I randomly decided to delve back into my spiritual past and began reading the New Testament. Initially being a history teacher I struggled with it at first. I was scared, like many of us who came later in life to religion I am sure are. Although, I don\u2019t know if others felt this way but when I would read I would feel a sense of calmness I had never felt before. I can\u2019t put words on it. I think it does because Christian beliefs has directly aligned with the gradual progression in my life. Seeking humility, striving tirelessly to be a better human being, and most importantly love. \n\n\u201cA new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.\u201d\n\nMeaning we love each other because we are all human. Flawed in nature, and that we all must give seek toward forgiveness.

All human authority.\n\nI hate getting close to people with authority over anything outside of themselves and their own property, if you understand me. I hate talking with professors, with my parents, with the policemen, with the doctors, with my bosses, with priests, with politicians, with any person of made up human \"authority\".\n\n\nI cannot share anything personal with them and I cannot ever be relaxed while talking to them. I, quite simply, do not trust people with authority as people with good intentions. I think anyone with any meaningful authority over other people (from a president to a market worker) only tries to find ways to excersise their power over others. They always try to control others in some machiavellian way, even if it is small or big.\n\n\nThe main reason why I hate people who hold authority is basic: they are actually not innately different from the lowest of humans in this world. They were conceived and grew in another's person's body, they ate food someone else ate and, quite frankly and rudely, they pi**ed and s*at in another person's body. Then, when they were born, they were filthy and unable to do anything. They were the weakest form of life on this planet, just like me and you who is reading this. \n\n\nAt the end, they are going to die like everyone of us and their bodies will decompose and turn into nothing. In a million years no one will remember them, just like no one will remember you and me.\n\n\nAnd these people, whether they are parents, clergymen, monarchs, physically strong or professionals in a field, have the audacity to look down on others and belittle them and speak about some \"Authority.\" Try telling me you have authority when we both die and rot in the grave, genius, we will see if you really have authority over anything.\n\n\nI hate authority so much that I am thinking about never having children or fighting for a better place in a job. Authority, any authority, brings out the worst possible things in persons and turns them selfish, narcistic and evil.\n\n\nI don't trust any authority figures, never have and never will, and I will try to make sure I never hold authority over anyone. Human hierarchy is a satanic, evil invention that desires to control another person occupy the place that rightfully belongs only to God, and to look down upon the neighbour who is \"lesser\" in the hierarchy. This has always been the way, ever since chattel slave owners and feudal lords.\n\n\nSo I hate it.","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678542989.0},{"title":"Feeding The Spirit","author":"Diligent-Tie-5500","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11o6yee\/feeding_the_spirit\/","text":"**So He humbled you,\u00a0allowed you to hunger, and\u00a0fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall\u00a0not live by bread alone; but man lives by every** ***word*** **that proceeds from the mouth of the\u00a0Lord.** (Deuteronomy 8:3)\n\nCommunion with God is the most powerful tool we have. God\u2019s presence increases very noticeably when fasting. It was right after Jesus fasted 40 days and nights that He began preaching and performing miracles at a very high rate.\n\nThere are many ways to fast. You can just eat a bit less food than usual. You can fast like Daniel did and abstain from wine, flesh and bread. Pray to the LORD for direction.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never abstained from food and drink, you should probably ease into it by just consuming a bit less and observing the feeling of hunger, which you will notice fades after a short time. It\u2019s important to not believe false thoughts of \u201cI NEED to eat as much as I have been\u201d, and do your best to avoid being triggered to eat by the feeling of hunger. As you pray and use self-control to not be triggered, and learn to get comfortable with the feeling of hunger, you will realize that it\u2019s just a feeling that fades, and you can go without food longer than you thought possible.\n\nFasting does not necessarily have to be with food. You can do your best to abstain from something you are attached to. For example, God showed me I\u2019ve been spending too much time on certain social media pages and websites, so I\u2019ve been doing my best to use technology as infrequently as possible.\n\nAttachments are difficult to break free from, but I\u2019ve learned a great way to do so is to \u201cfeed the Spirit\u201d. When I feel urges to do things I\u2019m working to abstain from, I do my best to **be present and fight the urge**, by getting on the floor and praying, reading the Bible or meditating on it. It\u2019s difficult. I feel the laptop\/cellphone pulling me in, but if I **fight** and get into the prayer\/reading\/meditation, the Spirit is fed and I feel empowered to continue seeking God and detach from the vice.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to replace worldly attachments with something spiritual. For example, I used to be attached to playing video games and watching television, but I\u2019ve replaced these activities with watching Biblically edifying videos and writing about the Bible.\n\nWhen deep in worldly activities like we\u2019ve all been, spiritual activities can seem boring. But truly, when you **fight** the evil, doubting and distracting thoughts with prayer and other spiritual activities, God will show you what true peace and joy is.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678497718.0},{"title":"How do you strengthen your faith?","author":"Gabetheplushtuber","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11o6vux\/how_do_you_strengthen_your_faith\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678497529.0},{"title":"What is the true meaning of \u201crepent\u201d?","author":"J0hn-Rambo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11obbd1\/what_is_the_true_meaning_of_repent\/","text":"Often when I see Christians preaching repentance, I see some incongruous retorts from individuals. It appears that most Christians agree that we are called to repent. However, it seems that the differing understandings of what \u201crepent\u201d truly means are causing confusion and discord. It is incredibly important to understand its true meaning, so important in fact, that your very salvation can be in peril if you get it wrong. \n\nWhat is the Greek word for repent? \u201c\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1f73\u03c9\u201d; which means to think differently or afterwards, that is, reconsider (morally to feel compunction).\n\nSome of you may respond better to the current dictionary definition (which sometimes can be misleading as modern definitions can change from the historical definitions, but not in this case). What is the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition? See for yourself: [https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/repent](https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/repent)\n\nTo put it simply, the biblical meaning of repent as it relates to us is: **To feel sorrow, regret and\/or contrition for ones past and to turn from sin and dedicate oneself to the amendment of one's life.**\n\nI will emphasise that you must let Christ into your life to do the amending, as you can\u2019t do it by yourself, you\u2019re too weak. But you must recognise that you need change and be willing and striving for change.\n\nEzekiel 18:21-23 confirms this: \u201cBut if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, many professed Christians today think that to repent means to apologize to God, say a \u201csinner\u2019s prayer\u201d, and perhaps depending on which denomination they belong; to confess their sins to a priest. This is NOT true repentance, and these individuals have been deceived into thinking that God will tolerate Christians living lives of unrepentant, wilful sin and then welcome them with open arms when He returns.\n\nWhilst God was manifest in the flesh on this earth as Jesus Christ, He was very clear: \n\n\u201cI tell you, Nay: but, **except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish**.\u201d (Luke 13:3)\n\n\u201cMany will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?\n\nAnd then will I profess unto them, **I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity**.\u201d (Matthew 7:22-23)\n\n**A good guide to genuine repentance:**\n\n\u00b7 Regretting\/acknowledging the sin;\n\n\u00b7 understanding the magnitude of the sin;\n\n\u00b7 forsaking the sin;\n\n\u00b7 worrying about the future consequences of the sin;\n\n\u00b7 acting in a way opposite to that of the sin (for example, for the sin of lying, one should speak the truth);\n\n\u00b7 refraining from lesser sins for the purpose of safeguarding oneself against committing greater sins;\n\n\u00b7 confessing the sin;\n\n\u00b7 praying for atonement;\n\n\u00b7 correcting the sin however possible (for example, if one stole an object, the stolen item must be returned; or, if one slanders another, the slanderer must ask the injured party for forgiveness);\n\n\u00b7 remembering the sin for the rest of one's life;\n\n\u00b7 refraining from committing the same sin if the opportunity presents itself again;\n\n\u00b7 teaching others not to sin.\n\nThe grace of God the Father and the Son be with you all.","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678510999.0},{"title":"I need help with a school project","author":"inconsolablespirit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11ob5ct\/i_need_help_with_a_school_project\/","text":"Hi, I am a university student taking an introductory religions course.

The word itself means law, but in Hebrew the letters have their own names with meanings, which makes every Hebrew word an acronym, so to speak. Tav means [\"mark\"](https:\/\/www.bibletools.org\/index.cfm\/fuseaction\/Lexicon.show\/ID\/H8420\/tav.htm) and originally had the shape of a [cross](https:\/\/www.ancient-hebrew.org\/ancient-alphabet\/tav.htm), which indicates that \"mark\" can mean cross. Vav means [\"nail\"](https:\/\/www.bibletools.org\/index.cfm\/fuseaction\/Lexicon.show\/ID\/H2053\/vav.htm), Rosh means [\"chief\"](https:\/\/www.bibletools.org\/index.cfm\/fuseaction\/Lexicon.show\/ID\/H7218\/rosh.htm) and He means [\"behold\"](https:\/\/www.bibletools.org\/index.cfm\/fuseaction\/Lexicon.show\/ID\/H1887\/he.htm).\n\nIf we combine the meanings of the letters we get the phrase:\n\n***\"Behold the chief is nailed to the cross!\"***\n\nThe chief is our God who came to earth and died as a curse of the law on the cross for our sins (Galatians 3:13).\n\n[Image](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/torahisteaching.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/torah-in-hebrew-writing-1.jpg?fit=460%2C375&ssl=1)","upvote_ratio":0.21,"created_utc":1678548792.0},{"title":"Help me out fellow followers of Christ.","author":"Emotional_Elk4385","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11o5i39\/help_me_out_fellow_followers_of_christ\/","text":"So basically, I'm going to try to convert a friend to the faith on Tuesday. Today at school, me and a friend were talking, and he was telling me about how he thinks that hell can't be real because he thinks an all loving God wouldn't be able to send a good person to hell. My response was telling him that no one is good but god, since we all have sinned and committed evils, and the only way to escape hell is by repenting to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He then told me \"So if there was a person, an ideal man, who's never committed a crime, never lied, and never wronged anyone else, are you saying that he would go to hell if he didn't accept Christ as his savior.\" Then I did the good person test on him to show him how none of us are good even if we don't realize, so we all deserve hell, and the only way to escape is through the acceptance of Christ as your savior. The moment I said this, the bell rang, and we both had to go to different classes, so we couldn't continue our conversation. The next time I have class with him is on Tuesday, so I plan to use this extra time to prepare myself to continue a conversation with him, with my goal being to convert him by the end of the conversation. So to finally get to the point, I need some help and advice on how to convert him. Some specifics that I could use are details to explain how we are all fundamentally evil, and some scientific facts in the Bible for backup.\n\nTLDR: Attempting to convert a friend on Tuesday. Need advice. For some specifics, his concern was that he thinks a loving god wouldn't send someone to hell.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678493777.0},{"title":"Sabotaging my relationship with god","author":"dejael","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Christianity\/comments\/11o5cb6\/sabotaging_my_relationship_with_god\/","text":"I feel like it\u2019s only a matter of time before I end up committing the unpardonable sin, for no other reason than I just seem to ruin all my relationships in life and often times have strong emotional reactions to things.
