They were not denied entry this time. Surprised again and curious, they asked the staff about what changed this time.\n\n\"Well we had a couple visit us last week from your subreddit and we denied them entry. Unfortunately they were the new owners of the bar and were not very happy about what happened. So we have changed our policy to allow people from the jokes subredit as long as they do not create a scene.\", came the reply.\n\n\"That would not be a problem, since we are just going to talk about buying and converting this property into a private residence for myself\", replied the businessman grinning rudely.\n\nAll three were immediately escorted outside by security.\n\n\"THIS IS NOT RIGHT!\", protested the furious trio being escorted outside of the premises.\n\nThe manager announced coldly, \"We have just received a directive from management to disallow entry for a Mr. (the businessman).\"\n\nLater the surprised staff asked the manager if they really got such an email. Grinning the manager replied- \"No, but management of a bar sent a mail to the manager forbidding entry of the same businessman in the jokes subreddit. I know we should not consider jokes from that subreddit anymore but at the same time we would not want any untoward incidents too\", as the manager posted the same joke with his mobile.",

The show begins, and the magician invites a woman on stage as his volunteer. “What’s your name, young lady?” asks the magician, to which the woman responds, “Hiro”. At the magician’s instruction, Hiro sits down in a chair, and blindfolds herself. “I want you to nod your head all the way down” says the magician, and once again Hiro listens. The magician then rolls an apple just in front of the chair. “Now, Hiro” says the magician, “I want you to slowly nod your head upwards.” As Hiro raises her head, the apple begins to float. The magician asks Hiro to continue moving her head, but now in any direction she wants. The audience is amazed as the apple follows her every movement. At the end of the performance, a tall man, with a short man, approaches the stage. “What’s the secret?” Asks the tall man. “The whole time it was Hiro” responds the magician, not so quick to give up his secret. “She magically moved the apple with her head.” “Too bad I couldn’t see all that well sitting behind everyone” goes the short man. “I’m sure it was incredible”.\n\nThe next day, the the magician returns to the same bar, and upon noticing Hiro in the audience once again, says “Since you were so lovely yesterday, come back on up!” The same act ensues, and the audience is again astonished. This time a young man, with an old man, approaches the stage. “What’s going on here?” Asks the young man. Once again, the magician responds, “The whole time it was Hiro, she magically moved the apple with her head.” “In all my years” goes the old man, “I’ve never seen a show like yours. Well done”\n\nThe third day, Hiro volunteers and the show goes on as per usual. This time, a skinny man, with a fat man, approaches the stage. “How do you do it?” asks the skinny man. “You see, the whole time it was Hiro, she ma…”\n\nBOOOOOM! goes the fat man.",

        "text": "One day, Hillary Clinton decided she needed a break from politics and the constant pressures of life in the public eye. So, she took a trip to the rural countryside, hoping to find solace and tranquility.\n\nWhile exploring a small town, she came across an old man sitting on his porch. He was rocking back and forth in his chair, whittling away at a piece of wood. Hillary, being the people person that she is, couldn't resist striking up a conversation.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" she began. \"I'm Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate. I've come to this town to escape the chaos of my life and enjoy the simplicity of the countryside. I was wondering if you could tell me a story that might put things into perspective for me.\"\n\nThe old man looked up from his whittling, eyed her for a moment, and then said, \"Well, now, I do have a story for you. It's about a turkey named Tom.\"\n\nHillary nodded, eager to hear the man's tale. The old man began to weave his story.\n\n\"Tom was a unique turkey. He was known all over town for his ability to climb trees. It was a strange sight, seeing a turkey up in a tree. People would gather 'round, taking bets on whether Tom would make it to the top. Now, Tom had a sweetheart, a lovely turkey named Tina. She would watch him from the ground, her eyes full of admiration as he climbed higher and higher. The townspeople loved seeing the two lovebirds together, and many believed their romance made Tom even more determined to conquer each tree he faced.\"\n\nThe old man continued, \"One day, as Tom was showing off his tree-climbing skills to Tina, a storm rolled in. The wind howled, the rain poured, and lightning lit up the sky. Tom, being the determined turkey he was, continued to climb higher, despite the danger. Tina watched from below, her heart pounding with worry for her beloved Tom.\"\n\n\"Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the storm passed, and Tom was able to make his way back down to the ground, where a relieved Tina awaited him. The townspeople cheered and celebrated the love between Tom and Tina, and the couple's tale became a local legend.\"\n\nHillary, impressed by the turkey's talents and romance, asked, \"So, what happened to Tom? Is he still climbing trees?\"\n\nThe old man went on, “Well, one day, a group of ornithologists came to town to study Tom. They concluded that turkeys aren't supposed to climb trees. In fact, they said it was downright unnatural. So, they clipped Tom's wings and put him back on the ground where he belonged.\"\n\nUpon seeing Tom's clipped wings, Tina decided that a grounded Tom wasn't the adventurous gobbler she had fallen in love with, and she left him for a more daring turkey.\n\nWith his wings clipped and Tina gone, Tom felt utterly defeated and heartbroken. He decided he couldn't live with the shame of being a grounded turkey. So, he hatched a plan to end it all in the most fitting way possible: by launching himself off a tall barn roof, hoping to finally experience flight one last time. As he plummeted to the ground, the townspeople gasped in horror, but they couldn’t look away. And soon after, nobody in the town even remembered who Tom was.\n\nHillary frowned, feeling bad for Tom. \"That's a sad story. But what's the moral? What can I learn from it?\"\n\nThe old man looked Hillary straight in the eye and said, \"The moral, ma'am, is that even tree-climbing turkeys know when it's time to stop.\"",
