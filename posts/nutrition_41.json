I tried Sneak powder, which was tasty, but I got migraine-level headaches while drinking it (I'm fairly confident it was the cause, I was getting them for weeks until I stopped drinking it). I did a little googling and it seems sucralose can trigger that reaction in some people- and thinking back, I used to get minor headaches a lot more when I was drinking energy drinks at work. \n\nAnyway, is there any other brand that I should look into? Since I became aware of sucralose Ive noticed it's in practically every energy drink except redbull. Sugar and calories in general aren't really an issue for me in this case, I just like something fruity/refreshing every now and again. I'm not opposed to getting straight caffeine or even a pre-workout supplement but like, I want to enjoy what I'm drinking and getting a flavored powder saves me a step of mixing a whole cocktail.

We want to change that but I’m oblivious to this sort of thing.\n\nWe like eating relatively healthy. His lunch typically consists of a sandwich (deli meat, Swiss cheese, tomato, spinach, quite a bit of mayo), about half a cup of yoghurt, some veggies chopped up, and usually a couple random things thrown in like a cheese string, banana, orange, granola bar (sometimes a protein bar if we remember to grab them at the store). \n\nHe works as a cabinet finisher and it can be pretty laborious at times. He’s clearly in a calorie deficit and we want to change that. So what are some high calorie healthy foods that can easily be thrown together? I tried googling but I want to know more prepared food options as opposed to “avocado” or “egg”. Any ideas?",

This makes it physically and psychologically easier to get into a hypo-caloric state.\n\nBut what if you are already at a healthy body weight? What if you need to GAIN weight??? Society seems to have this image of an overweight person’s ideal diet that has become the universal gold standard. \n\nTo a lesser extent, these foods are also touted for their micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc.). But even this has diminishing returns, as eating more than your daily needs doesn’t yield any real health benefits.\n\nTLDR; If you are getting enough micronutrients and can maintain a healthy body weight, your current diet should be deemed as healthy.

I have a coworker who makes some claims to clients that seem.... questionable (based on my understanding). I was wondering if someone could give their stance on these topics to help me understand them, or perhaps there is something I am missing. \n\n\n**Claim 1: Excess protein consumption (esp. from meat) causes protein to calcify in the GI tract, and that consuming foods such as ground papaya seeds will flush this calcification out of your intestines. \n**\n\nBased on my understanding of protein: we can't store excess protein, and any excess protein is either stored as fat or excreted. I understand that there are downsides to excess protein consumption, but calcification isn't one I've read or heard of.\n\n\n**Claim 2: It's very important what the pH levels of the food we eat are. When you eat too much acidic food it throws your pH out of a natural range and causes lots of inflammation and other issues.\n**\n\nMy thoughts: Stomachs are strongly acidic, and kidneys (along with blood) help regulate our pH levels. As part of homeostasis, our body will naturally maintain an appropriate pH level, within reason. It shouldn't really be an issue unless we eat almost entirely alkaline or acidic foods. \n\n\n**Claim 3: He tells clients to eat a diet mostly consisting of fruits, and sprouted nuts and seeds.\n**\n\n For people who are exercising regularly, this is nowhere near what I would recommend and it's confusing. I know I am not 100% correct but would love to hear other opinions on this.",

I’ve taken 4 a day in the past for weight gain and ended up seriously overdosing on several vitamins. It wasn’t fun haha.\n\nAre there any easy to drink shakes I can buy that have high calories like Boost but little to no vitamins?
