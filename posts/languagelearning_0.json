        "text": "English is my second language, spanish is my first. I absolutely know english fluently and know everything about grammar and even only think in my head in english. The only issue I have though is that I can't really speak it without having to think about it instead of it just coming out of my mouth naturally. The reason why is because I'm kind of insecure about my english even though I would say it sounds fluent but you can still hear a little accent there, to me I  just think it sounds weird. I even think it's an accomplishment when I say a full sentence without it sounding weird or like I'm not pronouncing the words too harshly (this might have to do with the fact spanish is my mother tongue and we pronounce words strongly if you know what I'm saying). My issue is that I also stutter, and my mind goes instantly blank while speaking, and can't really talk it fast, and these stupid reasons are the reason why I can't even socialize. Does anyone have any tips that can help with this?",

        "text": "Hello, all.\n\nThis might not be the most traditional post on /r/languagelearning, but I thought my fellow language lovers might have some good advice for my current conundrum.\n\nI'm living in a French-speaking region of the world, and I'm enrolled in a university there studying finance. I'm studying at this university specifically because the program is great and I really want to improve my French. The university offers the program either monolingually (French), bilingually (French and English), or trilingually (French, English, and Spanish).\n\nI speak English natively, my Spanish is probably at a C2 level (it's my heritage language), and my French is at a strong B2/C1.\n\nI did a semester in the bilingual program and I didn't like it as much because everyone spoke fluent English so everyone spoke in English with me. However, in groups, it was all French, but I felt weird speaking in French when everyone established that I spoke English.\n\nI'm kind of interested in the monolingual program because I think everyone there is going to feel more comfortable speaking French, so my French will improve. I'm also interested in the trilingual program because I'll get to improve my business skills in all three languages, also, as a language learner, it'd be amazing to have a degree in your field and have it explicitly say \"trilingual.\" That sounds awesome! I'm not so interested in the bilingual program. I will say that this only applies to the core courses, as the specialized courses for my major (finance) will be exclusively in French. I'm also required to study abroad, and I'm thinking of Chile to strengthen my Spanish. I think that if I can study abroad twice (which I'm actively going to pursue), I'm going to see if I can study in Romandy/Suisse Romande or France, to strengthen my French.\n\n**Long-term plan**: work in finance on Wall Street, and then live and work in Miami. If all my dreams come true, then I live in Latin America and make an American income. Therefore, Spanish and English will always be relevant in my life, English being more relevant, and French to a way lesser degree. Maybe I'll work with Swiss/French/Mon√©gasque/Belgian/Luxembourgish bankers at some point in my career.\n\nThanks, merci y gracias!",

We're all human and unless you have a built-in environment like a university or insane self-motivation, then sooner or later, you will stop.\n\nThe \"natural\" method, or comprehensible input, or immersion, whatever you want to call it has that big advantage. Obviously in the beginning, it's a lot of work to listen to even a 10 min podcast but as you advance, your tolerance increases until it's about as much as much effort as listening to your NL. You don't get tired. And that's a big thing especially if we're talking about thousands of hours needed to reach \"fluency\" or your end goal.",

The foreign languages that I already speak are extremely popular and thus offer subtitles for 90% of the videos that I want to watch, and anyway I've reached a point where I can listen to entire podcast episodes and series in these languages without a transcript anyway (so activating them is more for convenience), so I have already become accustomed to subtitles.",

I was wondering if anyone who has Dyslexia has learned another language successfully? I am trying to hard and barely keep afloat. I would also like to put out there that this is the only subject I do not have an A in. \n\nI know all Dyslexics are different, so I will put my struggles here. \n-My vowels tend to get mixed up even if I know how to spell a word. Sometimes, I can catch this, but not all the time. I am the worst with \"ie\" mix ups. \n-It gets worse when I get frustrated and letters can move.\n- It is also auditory for me. There are many words in english I can read correctly and not pronounce correctly. \n- Word recollection. Often, I want to use a word, and it just will not come to the forefront on my mind, and this is with English, which is currently my only language.  \n- There is a lag. I'll actually know what is being said, but I will ask, and right before they start to explain, I realize what was said. \n\nThe list is actually really long, so I decided to stop. With English, I still struggle at times, but for the most part, I can work around my Dyslexia. With Spanish I have no tools available specific for learning with Dyslexia and I could not learn English until I was taught in a way that was Dyslexia oriented. \nI can also say that even though I am struggling I am oddly doing better than the first go around. I was a child then, though üòÖ\nWorst part about this is many of the struggles I thought I had gotten over are rearing their ugly head into my everyday life with English now, too. It's kind of like learning a new language sent my Dyslexia into overdrive.  Anyways I really hope someone has suggestions! I am sorry this ended up being so long.",

This is way harder said than done, especially since the languages share such similar patterns and sounds. I initially thought learning one at a time would be best, as that was the easiest way to not get confused between them. But when I move onto the next language and don't speak the previous for a while, I basically lose my ability in the previous language. On the flip side, when I study the languages at the same time, I get confused and mix them up (ex. adding Chinese words into Japanese sentences).\n\nFor context, I learned Mandarin Chinese in an intensive program in university and then switched to Japanese in order to study abroad in Japan. After learning Japanese, I basically lost any and all of my abilities in Mandarin. I live in Korea now and have been trying my best to learn Korean, but I've noticed that my Japanese knowledge interferes with being able to progress in Korean. \n\nIs it best to consistently study all 3 languages as often as possible? Should I break them up into blocks (like Chinese one week, Japanese the next, etc.)? What is the best course of action for continuing to progress in and maintain all 3 languages? \n\nWhen I've asked for advice about this before, people tell me to just give up and focus on one language only, but I refuse to believe it's not possible!",

If I make a mistake,\nplease give me the correct German in parentheses before your actual response.\nFor example, if I say:\n\nWas kann man finden in Bonn?\n\nYou would respond:\n\n(Was kann man in Bonn finden?)\n\nFollowed by your actual response.\n\nFurther, if I type English in square brackets, it means I don't know the German\nfor it.

        "text": "I see a lot of success stories here from people who have reached C1/C2 in their target language, and while I love to read them and find them incredibly motivating, I thought it might be encouraging for someone new to learning a language to see my \"success story\" as someone still making my way to A2. I say success story in quotes because I still have a long way to go, as you'll see, but I'm sure many of you can relate to the feeling of excitement that comes from checking off some of the milestones I'll get into.\n\n**Background:** I'm learning Tagalog/Filipino, with the main goal of being able to understand friends who speak it. Speaking, reading, and writing are all things I've been practicing as well, just to a lesser extent. **Past language-learning experience:** I don't speak a second *spoken language*, but I've learned American Sign Language (ASL) to a conversational, one-on-one proficiency, but that was after many classes, tutoring sessions, and going to many Deaf community events. This unfortunately led me to believe that I had two options for learning a language: classes or Duolingo. Thankfully I discovered some language learning YouTubers (Lindie Botes, first, then Matt vs Japan, Steve Kaufmann, etc.) who inspired me to take independent language learning seriously. THIS SUB also encouraged me so much to take language learning seriously. **Regarding time:** I should also say that I work full time, but am able to study at work depending on the day, and I'm not taking classes this semester. I have one cat and zero children, so I have a lot of free time to dedicate to language learning.\n\n**Resources:** (generally in order of how helpful they have been)\n\n1. [**Tagalog Decks**](https://www.tagalogdecks.com/) \\- this language-specific SRS deck app and website from [Tagalog.com](https://Tagalog.com) has been hugely helpful. Within about two months of using it, I've studied 1400/2000 cards, and the impact of this on my listening comprehension has been clear. \n2. **Tutoring** \\- I've had upwards of 30 lessons since I started studying on the 1st of the year. Some lessons have been classic teaching-style with PowerPoint, some have been listening practice, some conversation practice, and sometimes a mixture. I do want to hone my goals for tutoring sessions, but as a beginner, I think it's okay to let the tutors/teachers lead, since they're going to have a pretty good idea of what will help you. Any tips on this subject would be appreciated!\n3. **Mango Languages** \\- apps that teach Tagalog are somewhat uncommon (Duolingo does not), but I was grateful to discover that my local library offers a free subscription to this app. It only contains one unit for Tagalog, with ten chapters, which I completed in less than a month. However, it made for a good start.\n4. **Textbook** \\- I began my studies with *Tagalog for Beginners* by Joi Barrios. It took me about 2 months to finish, and was also a good introduction to all sorts of vocabulary, grammar, stories, etc. In the beginning, I was doing every exercise, and by the end, I was reading through the dialog and stories of each lesson on LingQ and calling it a day. \n5. **Readers** \\- there are very few books available in Tagalog on Amazon, so online reading resources have been incredibly helpful. I used my free trial of LingQ to read lots of children's stories and work through the last several chapters of the textbook I mentioned, but since then I have graduated to (slowly) working my way through a Wattpad novel using [Tagalog.com's free reader](https://www.tagalog.com/reader/).  I do want to read more as I continue my studies, so any tips y'all have would be appreciated.\n6. **YouTube teachers** \\- if you really seek them out, you can find lots of people offering totally free, in-depth tutorials regarding various vocabulary, grammar points, etc. I keep a list of teachers along with links to some of their best playlists on my [Tagalog resource Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_V_SHPUirhUPXTsOzP9r0xkoI_xQQ3VpyMSaiii70ps/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**Stats &amp; More Background Info**\n\n* As of writing this, **I have studied for 128 hours** (average of 1h 44m/day).\n* **I have \"immersed\" for 141 hours** (average of 1h 54m/day).\n* At 50 hours and 100 hours, I recorded a quick check-in by reading and listening to various things and recording how much I understood, so I can look back on my progress in the future. \n* Things I count as studying: flashcards, apps, textbook study, reading, tutoring sessions, some Pimsleur, and things of that nature.\n* Things I count as immersion: listening to podcasts, watching YouTube, watching movies and TV shows, even if they're dubbed and even if I have English subtitles on, etc. \n* I track my time via TimeCap, and generally hit play as soon as I start a movie and hit pause as soon as the credits roll, and the same for podcasts and other media. For me, I'm not just tracking how many hours I've spent hearing the language, I'm also tracking how much time I've dedicated to it, even if I'm watching a movie that doesn't have as much dialog.\n* Early on, when I'd listen to a podcast in Tagalog, I would understand *nothing*, naturally. That's where Taglish podcasts came in handy, since some speak 70-90% in English and 10-30% in Tagalog. By listening to a podcast like Telebabad Tapes, I was able to familiarize myself with various common turns of phrase, with the helpful context of English. I understand why some steer clear of Taglish, but to be honest, I see it as a gift. In the future, I'd like to create a list of podcasts organized by approximate Tagalog/English percentages, with the idea that once a learner understands most of one, they can move onto the next.\n* I'm picking up on more and more without subtitles, but if I'm watching a dubbed show that I'm genuinely interested in, I'll often rewind, put on English subs, and re-watch a scene if I feel like I missed something.\n\n**Things I've learned about language learning:**\n\n* Someone once told me **\"Don't do anything unless you have to.\"** As a language learner, I only study using a certain method if I want to. I don't really force myself to do anything. My philosophy is that if I neglect an area, and it gets bad enough, then I'll probably find the motivation to go and work on it, if it's really holding me back. As a beginner, though, take advantage of the freedom. Explore all the avenues of learning and find what you enjoy.\n* Comprehension is as simple and as complicated as understanding the words someone uses. A few days ago, I ran across [this video](https://youtu.be/DlGYeWTflBQ) about getting tired after becoming full/satiated, and was so excited that I understood most of it. So I started to pick apart *why* I understood it, and realized it was because he speaks clearly, I know most of the words he uses, and I generally have a good understanding of what he's talking about. Other videos of his are even better, since he uses more visual aids (mostly stock photos) and gestures to various body parts when he discusses them. If I could just find videos exactly like this, but one for every major conversation topic, I'd be set!\n* One time, in an I-Witness documentary, [someone said \"Laban lang,\"](https://youtu.be/Ubz1ESh81dM?t=1210) and that stuck with me, because I knew \"lang\" (it means \"just\" or \"only\"), but couldn't understand what he was saying before it, since I didn't know the word and there aren't any subtitles. A week or so later, I was in a tutoring session, and the tutor mentioned \"laban\" and said it meant \"fight.\" Immediately, my brain remembered hearing that, and made sense of this thing I had almost forgotten about (laban lang = just fight, or just keep fighting). That experience really proved to me that the brain is always trying to make sense of things. The more attention you can afford to give your immersion, the more you will be rewarded. (Also, some sources say this is borrowed from Cebuano, which I would like to learn at least to an intermediate level in the future.)\n* Also, because of immersion, I understood \"'Di ba?\" to mean \"Right?\" before I even knew that it comes from \"Hindi ba?\" which is basically just asking, \"No?\" as in \"Am I wrong?\" That was another small thing that I got a lot of joy out of understanding.\n\nEvery day, when I start to get obsessed with where I might be in a month, or six months, I remind myself of how far I've come in 73 days. If my past self saw me now, they'd be so impressed, even with the small strides I've made. If I just keep studying and immersing myself in the language, my future self will probably be just as impressed with what I can accomplish.\n\nTo everyone out there learning Tagalog, or any other language of the Philippines, ***laban lang!***",
