        "text": "Mechanical vs. Hand Wind\n\nSo, I went down the watch collecting rabbit hole about 6 months ago. I've had a quartz Tag for many years that was a gift from my wife that's been my GADA. In September, I bought my first mechanical - a Seagull 1963 and then last month, I bought my first Automatic - a Glashutte Senator. I love all of the watches and like to wear them equaly, but what I quickly found out is 40 hour power reserve is pretty meaningless. If I go more than a day without wearing the GO, I'm winding that one along with the 1963 (but not the quartz, of course 😉).\n\nI guess I'm trying to figure out the allure of automatic watches. I mean, if it's your only watch, then I get it, you could literally set it, wind it, and you're good to go indefinitely. However, if you're a collector, and you have watches that all get a lot of wrist time, what's the point of paying the premium of the automatic feature? Is it like buying a fully loaded car? Gotta have all the bells and whistles? Are manual wind watches viewed as \"basic\"?\n\nWhat's everyone's thoughts?",

        "text": "I own an Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch and a couple of quartz chronographs, and I am on the market to add an automatic chronograph to my collection.\n\nBasic demands:\n\n\\-Automatic chronograph, preferably with 12 hours of cumulative chronograph time counting (I find this quite useful in my daily life), date window preferred\n\n\\-Dial size: preferably 40-42.5mm, 43-44mm may be manageable depending on specific model, anything beyond 45mm is too big.\n\n\\-Water Resistance: 100m and above preferred, can tolerate 50m if the watch is good.\n\n\\-Style: my current life and job situation does not call for dressing up that frequently, so sports and tool watch style preferred.\n\n\\--Budget is $6,000-$6,500 maximum, may be able to loosen up to $7,000 if the watch is good. Anything beyond $7,500-$8,000 would be a hard stretch for me.\n\n\\-This is an expensive watch for me, and I don’t really like pre-owned watches, so I’d rather buy from AD with full warranty (and additional warranty if necessary; I bought my Moonwatch from AD at listed price) . But if situation calls for flexibility, I’ll consider it.\n\n\\-I struggle a bit about resale value. I am not investing in watches, and I do intend to buy a piece I would love and keep. But I also hope the watch does not devalue too fast or too steeply.\n\nI currently have my eyes on the following options, each have their own pros and cons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Longines Spirit Chronograph $3,250 ](https://preview.redd.it/bx8zesjarfla1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8cd5117f25c65dbd8a1e5935b529780096b060d1)\n\n Pros: Way below budget. Dial size and design. Not strictly in-house movement but movement is designed specifically for Longines.\n\nCons: The “lowest” level of brand in this list, not sure about resale value. There is only one Longines AD near me and they don’t seem to have it in stock, not sure about stock situation.\n\n[ TAG Heuer Autavia Chronometer Flyback Chronograph Silver Dial $6,750 ](https://preview.redd.it/jg0oqiqcrfla1.png?width=317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=061e65bc945dbba4e867191895cd80af3864aff3)\n\nPros: Flyback chronograph, in-house movement. Dial Size and design is very much to my liking (probably my favorite dial design among all the options). May be able to secure a deal for a lower price from my local AD.\n\nCons: I own an old TAG Heuer link watch and I like it, but I understand there is a bit of polarity among the watch community about this brand. Would love to hear more about how this one weighs against other options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Omega Speedmaster Racing $8,500+ ](https://preview.redd.it/ujecui9grfla1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e3cbceea84994f834dd3e0c533e8e5d99073da99)\n\n \n\nPros: Brand and watch well received among the watch community. No need to question the quality and the movement. Love the design.\n\nCons: If I cannot secure a deal from AD this would be overbudget. I also already own an Omega, so I’d like to try something a little different. 44mm+ dial is also on the edge of too big for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Breitling Avenger\\/Navitimer\\/Chronomat\\/Aviator 8 $8,000-$11,000 ](https://preview.redd.it/1306ki7irfla1.png?width=1159&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4685e5a1c44cb9c6b5ef9c804da38e989c1fcf4b)\n\nPros: Brand is recognized for its chronograph pieces. Well-received by watch lovers. Classic aviation and navigation tool watch design.\n\nCons: Most models are way too big and bulky, except for some models in the Aviator 8 line. Also, almost every watch of this brand is overbudget for me. In addition, I’ve heard different stories about the resale value of Breitling watches, with some complaining that the resale value does not justify the original price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Zenith Chronomaster Original\\/Revival El Primero\\/Sport $8,500-$11,000 ](https://preview.redd.it/1g920grlrfla1.png?width=1627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e013ab1d7b8623cc94f6e3a32c5499799ac53851)\n\nPros: Brand is recognized as the pioneer of chronograph watches. Classic design, solid movement.\n\nCons: I’ve tried the original and the revival, and 38mm dial size is too small for me. Sport has a 41mm dial size, but if I cannot get a deal it would be overbudget.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? And are there any brands or specific watches you would recommend?\n\nMany thanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hi all, I’m looking for an AD to start building rep with to hopefully be able to get a Milgauss or Explorer 2 at retail one day. I have a purchase planned in the coming months (Omega Speedy Moon Phase) and there are a few stores near me that sell them and are also Rolex AD’s. The ones I’m familiar with are; Lenkersdorfer (Tysons Corner Mall), Tourneau (Pentagon City Mall), and Tiny Jewel Box (DC). I’m wondering if anyone has experience with any of these stores that they’re willing to share. Second question, how hard do y’all think it would be to get either of these watches from an AD? I know that subs, daytonas, and GMTs are pretty much impossible to get unless you buy the stores whole inventory but I’m not sure about the Explorer 2 and Milgauss as they seem to be less popular and I really love those watches.",
