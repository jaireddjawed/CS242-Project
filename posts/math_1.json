        "text": "This is a point of pure curiosity, and I might just be talking pure nonsense - just downvote me if what I'm saying is completely meaningless.\n\nFor background, I'm currently doing my second undergraduate degree - my first was in material science and engineering, but the one I'm currently doing is in computer science, and in particular I'm doing one of my concentrations in CS theory. I've always loved and taken naturally to pure mathematics, and in this concentration I've had to take a few classes that are varying shades of essentially pure math.\n\nOne such class, which I'm currently taking, is on things like automata and theory of computation - so far we've covered things like regular languages and deterministic/nondeterministic finite automata, context-free languages and grammars, I think we're going to talk about Turing machines later, etc. I think the nature of this material is why I'm in the mindset to think about this sort of meta-theory of proofs.\n\nWhat sparked this idea was working with the context-free pumping lemma. Of course, a number of problems on homework and exams were then to prove that some given language is not context-free using the lemma. What I noticed is that all of these proofs take an extremely similar form: we give some pathological string in the language as a function of the pumping length *p*, and then launch into a flurry of casework, essentially considering every possible form for the initial substring *u* (in the \"pumping decomposition\" *uvxyz*), then for each such *u* consider the resulting possible forms of *v* and *y*, and then show that in any such case, the pumping process invariably produces some new string which is not in the language. We then say that no matter how we decompose our string, we will contradict the pumping lemma, and the possibility of the language being context-free vanishes in a puff of smoke.\n\nThis surprised me, because in my other proof-based courses, the proofs seemed more \"different\" - we would learn a set of techniques and theorems that could be applied to a broad set of problems, but the proofs we'd have to do felt more individually \"different\", usually involving some unique small leap of logic that would allow the theorems we learned to be applied. These pumping lemma proofs almost feel more like an algorithm, except the initial step of discovering the pathological string, which sometimes has to be a little more creative.\n\nSo I have a bunch of questions. Is there some notion in which all these pumping lemma proofs can be formally considered to be \"the same proof\", in the way that it intuitively feels like they are? Is this actually boring and simply a consequence of the fact that the statement we're asked to prove (show that the given language is not context-free) is also essentially always the same? Is there some notion of placing these sorts of proofs, and the associated statement that they prove, into equivalence classes of any kind? Are there other places where this sort of thing occurs? *Is* there an algorithm to determine whether or not a language is context-free based on this sort of technique? And finally, are there non-context-free language for which the proof of that property is not as simple as the ones I've encountered, and is there some formal subclass of languages that are essentially \"non-context-free languages not amenable to this proof technique\"?\n\nAgain, apologizes if what I'm saying is pointless or just insane. This is just a point of pure curiosity, and from browsing this subreddit I know that there are people here who are knowledgeable and eager to share that knowledge, so I thought I'd ask.\n\nThank you!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/11s52jg/a_world_in_which_9_repeating_is_not_1/",
        "text": "Of course given a set (R,&lt;,+,\\*,1) satisfying Tarski's axioms for the reals and the standard map from decimals into R, .9 repeating maps to 1. But I wanted to dive into the structure that people actually have in mind when they separate .9 repeating from 1 and it had some... surprisingly nice structure. I think it could be improved too, feel free to investigate and share your thoughts!\n\n# TLDR/Abstract\n\nConsider your ordinary real number line except \"right below\" each real number is an infinite non-terminating decimal added to an integer and \"right above\" every real number is an infinite non-terminating decimal subtracted from an integer. This is essentially what most .9 repeating &lt; 1 people have in mind.\n\nThe resulting number line is still totally ordered with the least upper bound property. While you cannot add and subtract every pair of elements, you can miraculously add and subtract \"enough pairs\" to order the set of distances in a logical way.\n\n# Notation\n\nWe'll use N for the set of natural numbers (which we will assume to include 0), Z for the set of integers, and R for the set of real numbers. For n in N, let \\[n\\] be the set of naturals strictly less than n.\n\nWe define D to be the set of functions f from N to \\[10\\] such that there does not exist n' in N with f(k)=0 for all n&gt;n'. We identify D with the set of positive decimals with no integer part and no infinite tail of 0s (i.e. that do not terminate).\n\nWe equip D with the usual \"lexicographic\" total order &lt; .\n\nWe let R\\_1 be the cartesian product Z x D, and equip it with a total order &lt; that compares the Z component, then the D component.\n\nWe define -D in essentially the same way as D (the set of functions from N to \\[10\\] without a tail of all 0s), except with its total order &lt; flipped. We will identify -D with the set of negative decimals with no integer part and no infinite tail of 0s.\n\nWe define R\\_{-1} to be the cartesian product Z x -D and equip it with a total order &lt; that compares the Z, then -D components.\n\nFor d in D, we define Lim(d) to be the usual real number in (0,1\\] corresponding to d and for d in -D, we define Lim(d) to be the usual real number in \\[-1,0) corresponding to d.\n\nWe extend this to bijections:\n\nLim: R\\_{1} -&gt; R, (z,d) -&gt; z + Lim(d)\n\nLim: R\\_{-1} -&gt; R, (z,d) -&gt; z - Lim(d)\n\nwhich are trivially checked to be order-preserving.\n\nFor d in D, we use -d to denote its corresponding element in -D, and likewise for d in -D, we use -d to denote its corresponding element in D. This allows us to define a \"negation\" operation from R\\_1 to R\\_{-1} (and vice versa) via (z,d) -&gt; (-z,-d)\n\n# The \"full\" continuum\n\nWhen people say .9 repeating is less than 1, what they actually have in mind is that the platonic infinite sum of 9/10\\^n is less than the limit (in R) of the partial sums as n goes to infinity. We'll now intertwine R, R\\_1, and R\\_{-1} to reflect this idea. Call their disjoint union R'\n\nMorally, for x in R, we want Lim\\_1\\^{-1} (x) &lt; x &lt; Lim\\_{-1}\\^{-1} (x), and otherwise ordered by their limit in R. For x in R\\_1 and y in R, we say x&lt;y if Lim\\_1(x)&lt;=y. For x in R\\_{-1} and y in R, we say x&lt;y if Lim\\_{-1}(x)&lt;y. For x in R\\_1 and y in R\\_2 we say x&lt;y if Lim\\_1(x)&lt;=Lim\\_{-1}(y).\n\nThis is a linear order on R' satisfying the LUB property. So there is some validation for believing that they \"exist in the number line\" when most people haven't seen the real numbers actually defined! We can extract some more properties:\n\n# Euclidean spaces and subtraction\n\nFor x in R, (z,d) in R\\_1, and (z',d') in R\\_{-1}, we can define simply-transitive \"addition\" actions for R on R\\_1 and R\\_{-1} via\n\nx+(z,d)= Lim\\_1\\^{-1} (Lim\\_1(z,d)+x)\n\nx+(z',d')= Lim\\_{-1}\\^{-1} (Lim\\_{-1}(z,d)+x)\n\nwhich make R\\_1 and R\\_{-1} into Euclidean spaces (and R' the disjoint union of 3 Euclidean spaces).\n\nWe may therefore consider a \"subtraction\" operation on R\\_1  that maps R\\_1 x R\\_1 into R and (likewise R\\_{-1}).\n\nWe also have a \"negation\" operator on R' that maps R\\_1 into R\\_{-1} (and vice versa); by viewing this as distributive, we obtain an \"addition\" operation on R\\_1 x R\\_{-1} into R by letting\n\n(z\\_1,d\\_1)+(z\\_2,d\\_2)=(z\\_1,d\\_1) - (-z\\_2,-d\\_2)\n\nIn summary, writing R\\_0 for R, we have R\\_{i}+R\\_{j}=R\\_{i+j} if i, j, and i+j are all in {-1,0,1}. And we have R\\_{i}-R\\_{j}=R\\_{i-j} if i, j, and i-j are all in {-1,0,1}. We do not have a notion of R\\_1+R\\_1, R\\_{-1}+R\\_{-1}, R\\_{1}-R\\_{-1}, or R\\_{-1}-R\\_{1}.\n\nSo we have these partial functions of subtraction and addition on R' x R' that can be checked to satisfy the usual desired interactions with &lt;. But need to be extremely careful about allowing more generality to avoid the contradictions that arise in .9 repeating != 1 proofs. But in order to compare \"distances\" of elements in R' in a meaningful way, we must push a little more forward:\n\n# Addable pairs and a \"metric\"\n\nWe say a pair (d\\_1,d\\_2) in D are addable if for cofinitely many n in N,\n\n10(d\\_1(2n)+d\\_2(2n))+d\\_1(2n+1)+d\\_2(2n+1)&lt;99.\n\nMorally, this means that we can convert their sum into a single decimal by considering \"pairs\" of decimals at a time. We say that ((z\\_1,d\\_1),(z\\_2,d\\_2)) in R\\_1 are addable if (d\\_1,d\\_2) is addable and define (z\\_1,d\\_1)+(z\\_2,d\\_2) in R\\_1 in the expected way.\n\nWe do the same for R\\_{-1}. This allows us to do subtraction on certain pairs in R\\_1 x R\\_{-1} via negation.\n\nWe are now ready to compare distances.\n\nWe say D(a,b)&lt;D(c,d) if for cofinitely many n, the absolute value of the nth partial sums of |a-b| is less than the nth partial sum of |c-d| and likewise define where D(a,b)&gt;D(c,d). We say D(a,b)=D(c,d) if for cofinitely many n, the nth partial sums subtract to 0.\n\nWhat if none of these are true? And the partial sums eternally oscillate below and above 0? What was extremely unexpected (to me) is that if this happens, we must be in a scenario in which you can compute both a-b and c-d, so we can still compare |a-b| and |c-d| directly! And by comparing distances in this manner, the relation (a,b)\\~(c,d) if D(a,b)=D(c,d) is a indeed an equivalence relation on R' x R', and this induces a total order on R' X R' /\\~.\n\n# Loose Ends\n\nCan we extend R' in a manner that allows more general addition and subtraction but maintains a sensible total order? Can we incorporate the terminating decimals of other base systems and still have a total order? Are both possible simultaneously? What's the best that we can really do in a world in which .9 repeating is not 1?\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#",

When I want to know something detailed beyond my textbook (e.g. proof of a generalization of a theorem), after my own try I usually look up google, MSE/MOF, etc. However, I find when the math topic becomes more and more in-depth/specialized, they're much less useful/related search results, which sometimes let me wonder\"Why just nobody discuss this important theorem/lemma/conclusion online???\" What I need usually turns out lying in dedicated books which are just not accessible directly through google. \n\nOn the contrary, I find data science things seems always accessible directly on internet, be it original code, paper, document or blog. As for math, is it a better choice to go the classical way, i.e. borrow a pile of books of the field (GTM etc.) from lib and put them on my desk to search for? Can it be the problem of google's algorithm or problem in my own search technique?\n\nP.S. The learning resources this subreddit suggest are pretty nice but what I 'm interested in is looking up to technical things with a specific goal instead of general learning.\n\nWhat's your opinion?",

        "text": "I am currently learning Double-Integrals as part of my studies. When substituting in a multi-integral you have to add the determant of a combination of derivatives of u = f(x, y) &amp; v = f(x, y) (If you substitute in u and v) to find your new dudv. However when actually solving the Integral, you treat one of the vars as a const and the other as the var and intigrate for that one. My question is, whether, at that stage, I could use the classical method of substitution where I substidute u for f(x) for example and set du = 1/f(x)'. As far as I understand it, as long as I revert my function back to x before integrating for y, there shouldn't be a problem, right?\n\nNote: As I said, I am still a student, so some of the language I used might not be 100% accurate. You are welcome to point out such inaccuracies but please focus on the actual answer, unless you have difficulty understanding or suspect an actual misunderstanding I have. Thanks :)",

Give me any comments or critiques, I would love to hear it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1be6oY9hpr-mlq6assGV362QCXMqnNm4Y/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1be6oY9hpr-mlq6assGV362QCXMqnNm4Y/view?usp=sharing)",

        "text": "I protested to a friend during a board game, and now I’m confused. I wasn’t confused when I spoke up, however. I’ll tell you a story and you tell me if either he, or I, are correct.\n\nThis little argument we had was near the end of a four player board game. The game is very standard where there is a six-sided die, cards to collect, and pieces to move across the board as they land on different spots.  The move in question was during several sequential moves my wife made as she landed on several “lotto-type” spots in a row. A lotto spot says something like, “If you pay a fee to roll the die and the die comes up 3 or higher, you get to take the card (a prize) associate with this spot. If you do not roll a 3 or higher, your fee is forfeited.” \n\nWife lands on a lotto spot, she pays the fee and rolls a 2. She loses and play continues.\n\nWife lands on another lotto spot, she pays the fee and rolls a 1. She loses and play continues.\n\nWife lands on another lotto spot, and my friend says, “Do it again because now the odds are in your favor.”\n\nIt was at this point I interjected with, “No, the odds are not in your favor. You have the exact same odds as each of the other times you landed on a lotto spot. Each roll is completely independent.”\n\nMy friend counters with, “She now has a third opportunity to roll within range. The more chances a person has, the higher the probability to roll within a range. A person that has three opportunities to successfully roll within a range at least one time will have a higher probability of being successful than a person that has only one opportunity to roll within a range.”\n\nI continued to protest by saying that the previous rolls have nothing to do with the current roll and her chances of success are exactly the same as each of the previous times she landed on a lotto spot. I go on to mention that his line of thinking will cost him money at, say, the roulette table and we bicker back and forth for a few minutes.\n\nMy wife pays the fee, rolls out of the range, loses, and play continues. A few short minutes later, the game ends and my friend takes a deep breath as he winds up for his closing argument.\n\nHe asks me, “What are the chances that you flip a coin ten times and they are all tails?” I say, “Possible, but low.”\n\nHe presses on, “If you flip a coin 100 times, what are the chances they are all tails?” I say, “Almost zero.”\n\n“Boom!” he says as he gets up from the table and walks away. “That’s exactly what I mean. The more rolls, the better your odds.”\n\nIt’s at this point he believes he’s won the argument, and because I’m no math wiz, I don’t continue the argument with much vigor. The night ends and I can’t sleep because I have a sense that I’m correct about this argument, but I can’t cobble together the line of reasoning any further.\n\n**So now, here I am querying the internet hivemind of which you are all a part. Who was correct? He? I? Neither?** \n\nTo me it seems like he (even though he didn’t know it, because I asked him) was arguing along the lines of the Law of Large numbers, but 3 rolls certainly isn’t a large number. From what I know, and this is what I told him, unconvincingly, you need something like 250-300 rolls for the Law of Large Numbers to begin to show significant impact in your actual results versus your expected results.\n\nAlso, I don’t see how he wasn’t committing the Gambler’s Fallacy which Wikipedia describes as “the incorrect belief that, if a particular event occurs more frequently than normal during the past, it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa)”.\n\nSo I guess that’s it. He and I a great friends and I’m looking forward to hashing this out with him because I still suspect I’m right. **Am I?** If I’m not, I want to know why because I love learning my lesson.
