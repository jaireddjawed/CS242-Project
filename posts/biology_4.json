I've always wondered how spindle fibers (or was it microtubules? or both? sorry I just took biology out of interest, not my major.  I've stuck with engineering aerodynamics and physics mainly) communicate with eachother during both splits.  As far as I can find, there are no specific mechanisms as to how each side communicates.  Or if they need to at all?  Does the cell just \"commit apoptosis\" if something goes wrong and one side doesn't hold up it's end of the bargain.  Apparently Jung and Wolfgang worked on some theories together, but there are no definitive biological signals that I can find.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only answers are: the genetic material replicates and the cell divides.  I was just curious if I was missing something or if this was still being studied etc.  Sorry for any misconceptions or errors, it has been awhile, and I never made biology my main focus.  Lately I have been trying to get back into it for fun and this question always puzzled me.  Especially considering I can never find an answer to my question.  I only had one Professor that took me seriously and we both read some papers during his office hours and came up with nothing other than the fact that there has to be some underlying mechanism for each side of the cell to communicate.",

        "text": "I am reading \"The Body Electric\" by Robert O. Becker and Gary Selden, and a passage discussing electrical current in wound sites has sparked a question I'm curious about. Here is some relevant text: \n\n  \n*\"Then he took electrical measurements around the wound as each plant healed and sent out a new shoot near the cut. He found a negative current - a stream of electrons - flowing from the wound for the first few days. A similar current of injury is emitted from all wounds in animals.\"* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is in regard to the last sentence there. If there is an electrical current emitted from wounds in all animals, does this play some role in pain perception? As in, do more serious wounds produce more electrical current, and do we perceive this increase in electrical current as more intense pain? Based on some initial research it does seem that, before even thinking about pain, there is evidence for some kind of continuum from (small ---&gt; larger currents) matching (less ---&gt; more serious injuries)  \n\n\nI'm curious if there is any connection to pain here and would love to hear some opinions from those that know a thing or two about these areas!

        "text": "Hello! New biology student/amateur microscopist here. Also new to Reddit(:\n\nI went to collect some water from my local artisanal well today (it's regularly inspected for contaminants and tons of people use it, so it's supposed to be safe). After getting home and drinking a glass, I noticed something tiny and white at the bottom of my glass. I picked it up with a toothpick and put it under my microscope. It is definitely something alive or that was once alive because it has a membrane and some sort of nucleus.\n\nI did use the cup before with some freshly squeezed lemon juice in it (because my tap water is intolerable without it). I got the other half of the lemon I used from my fridge and squeezed it and found what I think are more of the same things. I also put these under my microscope and they look similar. \n\nThe picture without the string is of the one I pulled from the other half of the lemon. It looks pretty much the same as the first one did.\n\nI then put the first one under the microscope again and it looked different. It isn't as translucent as before, I can no longer see the nucleus, and there is a black stringy thing coming out. Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture of what it looked like at first, but I included a picture with the black string.\n\nI'm not educated enough yet to know what these are. Probably some part of the lemon, but they almost look like little eggs.. Also what is the string?? I am fairly certain that this came from the lemon and not the water. Can anyone tell me? \n\nPlz forgive my low-quality pictures. As I said, I'm a new student(:\n\nThank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The other one I found later](https://preview.redd.it/vy1xmxkgl0ma1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dcf54a32644baceb6ae4585db92b47cd8ce79ce1)\n\n[The first one I found](https://preview.redd.it/tzqzvxq2k0ma1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c3fb2c9e3f589a7471f38c78313de7b078402584)",

For a substitution you design a mutagenic primer with a base change for one direction, and a nonmutagenic primer for the other direction. After many rounds of pcr wouldn’t this create 50% strands that contain the substitution and 50% stranded that do not contain the mutation? \n\nI’m clearly missing something fundamentally here but how does the substitution become realized in the strand that does not contain a mutagenic primer?",
