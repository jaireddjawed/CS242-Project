I write under the name OTR and over the last year or so I have been able to have a career in music thanks to music streaming services. Without the internet and a general interest in streaming platforms, everything I have achieved would not have been possible.\n\nHow this all happened: I went to school for Aerospace Engineering and while still in school I landed an internship working for a steel manufacturing company in Kurashiki, Japan. There I decided to focus on playing piano and writing music since I didn't have any friends in Japan and needed something to do for almost a year. I bought one of those casio pianos and brought it back to my company dorm and practiced all the time. Fast forward a few more years - I graduated and ended up working for a defense contractor. Suddenly my music is noticed by a small music blog which landed me a remix opportunity. That remix ended up on several Spotify curated playlists allowing me to break into the music industry.\n\nIf you have any questions about me, about the music industry, even about aerospace engineering, living in Japan or just anything in general - ask away.\n\nEDIT: Wow I’m surprised this got so much attention! I’m answering everyone who posts a question but am spending some time with friends for a few hours. Will get back to questions in a bit!\n\nEDIT 2: I'm back with a little wine let's do this.\n\nEDIT 3: Some people are asking what I have coming up - this is just a little snippet of a song that's coming out later this month: [link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkvJN25nEGy/?taken-by=otrmusicofficial)\n",

        "text": "Both Directions At Once features original, never-before heard compositions, recorded by Coltrane's Classic Quartet in 1963 at Van Gelder Studios. On March 6, 1963, John Coltrane and his Classic Quartet— McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Elvin Jones –recorded an entire studio album at the legendary Van Gelder Studios. The album features unheard originals, and was released to the public 55 years later on 6/29/18. I’ve had the honor to work with John Coltrane’s son, Ravi Coltrane over the years and worked closely to bring this lost album to life along his side.\n\nI’ve professionally involved in jazz for more than 30 years as a producer, record label executive, educator and radio host. I’m currently the VP, Jazz Development at the Verve Label Group and previously worked at Motéma Music and Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\n**Listen to the

I spoke to you and for you and together we formed a mighty force in the War on Stupid.\n\nThen I went away to write my memoirs and look what happened. Tree Toss. Speakers Corner. Loud. Electric Circus. Fromage - all swept away, taking our fun and gleeful anarchy with it. Fake news, alternative facts, micro-aggressions, safe spaces, tiki torches, 24 hour cable news amplifying the loudest and stupidest voices while drowning out any voice of reason. But I am louder and with me as your megaphone, we will again wage the War on Stupid through my online channel FUN - [The FU\\_Network.](http://funetwork.tv)\n\n[Help me bring back FUN by supporting our IndieGoGo Campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fun-the-fu-network#/) \\- We're producing new versions of your old favourites like the ones above plus brand-new shows with that sly, subversive spirit that is truly Canadian.
