I got an unflattering grade for my thesis (a B+) and was awarded a Master of Arts degree Second class honours first division (2.1) in Sociology. Where I live I could have got a fully funded PhD scholarship if I was awarded a First class honours Masters degree if I had been given a slightly higher grade for my thesis (either an A- or A). Not only that but I would have had a chance to be awarded a funded PhD scholarship at some overseas university (or at least had a chance at competing for one). And that was my big dream to go and undertake an Phd overseas somewhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I am considering starting another Master of Arts degree in Criminology (the subject of my first MA was Sociology) from a different university in hope that I will do well enough to be awarded a First Class honours so that I can try and get a fully funded PhD scholarship overseas somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do think that a second time around and with the right choices I will make First Class honours. But still... Criminology and Sociology are almost the same subject - many universities don't offer degrees in Criminology as they consider it to be a sub-field of sociology. Plus then I would have two MA's which is very uncommon. In regards to trying for a scholarship afterwards I know some universities look at your entire academic record, or at least the last two years, when considering you for a funded PhD or scholarship, but I might be able to work around that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this idea crazy? Would it even work? Should I just bite the bullet and rack up huge debt paying for a PhD myself?",

How many hours of classes do you teach or have office duty?\n\n3. If your comfortable answering, what is your salary? Do professors get paid differently depending on the type of class taught (low level vs high level)\n\n4. If I were to become a math professor, would I for sure need a doctorate to be more than a TA? What kinds of other things are required of you (research, tutoring, conferences, etc)? I am not the most interested in the higher level math and would definitely be uncomfortable researching.\n\n5. Would I need a doctorate to teach Education classes? If I were to do education classes, is there any extra duties involved besides office hours or proctoring practicums/student teaching?\n\nIf you have any more insight beyond the questions I asked, it would be much appreciated!

The move was motivated by my husband, who was offered a faculty position in the city.  While we tried to negotiate a position for me, the school simply could not make that happen.  This ended up me looking for a position at a nearby school, which had a postdoc job available.\n\nWhile I am happy I can continue doing research, I am simultaneously demotivated by why I should keep doing research.  The reason being, I already threw away my chances of being an independent investigator.  When both my husband and I were on the faculty job market, we both received verbal and official offer letters.  Even now, I received an email from a school far away asking me for a site visit, which I politely declined.  Having to decline those and instead returning to a postdoc position was demoralizing.  While it was ultimately a good decision for my husband and my son, I cannot help but feel it was a bad career decision (no more young investigator status, extended postdoc training in a field that is not so exciting). \n\nI am beginning to think may be I should just give up on this whole research thing and stay at home/pursue other jobs, if they are interested in overqualified PhD.  What is a point when there is no trajectory for me to pursue my own scientific inquiries, but have to constantly follow what my PI says (for the record, the current PI is extremely supportive and told me he will try to internally promote me.  It's the institutional politics that is preventing this).  Whenever I see my ideas get selected for podium presentations and published in a manuscript, I keep thinking that could have been me, if I had my own lab.  It just sucks and even more depressing that I will never get a chance to do this.  \n\nI am not sure where I am going, but after \"learning\" how to plate bunch of cells today by a graduate student in the new lab, I am just kind of tired of this whole thing and felt like venting/asking for some input.

I love my career and I love doing research, though I have yet to successfully publish an article (I have one submitted that's been waiting for review for several months). My ultimate goal would be to get a full time university teaching job in the US in a supportive environment with the ability to do research on the side, but I've been applying for several years and received no offers or even interviews (at best, an email saying they had so many applicants they had to turn down worthy candidates).\n\nA little about my current position: the university is connected to one  in the UK and has strict rules about academic ethics, grades, etc, as per any British university (so the job is much more substantial than some universities in China who basically just want a warm body), and it's great in that it has a great sense of community (for the guys mostly) and the pay is well above the cost of living. But, I'm one of few women teaching here, and the ones who are here are mostly in supporting roles while all the managers are male. My husband and I were hired together with exactly the same background (besides my extra summer semester of adjunct experience in the US) and he's already received a promotion and a substantial (for China) raise, while I've received nothing of the sort. None of the current faculty will mentor me in research despite my asking (I partnered with two female profs at the partner university in the UK for my paper that's currently awaiting review) and the common reaction when I talk about my research is to make a vague comment of disbelief, or even to laugh in my face. I'm just scared that my career is stagnating in this kind of environment and scared that it'll permanently damage my career path especially given that my resume will be lesser than my husband's (who, incidentally, has no interest in research).\n\nMy question is, during my last year in China, what can I be doing to make myself more marketable and competitive for full time university level teaching jobs in the US? Obviously the ultimate thing would be get a PhD, but that's not feasible in this next year and probably not a good idea before my current student loans are paid off. I'm hoping to work on, and maybe submit for publication, another paper. What other steps can I take? Is there any hope of getting a real position, or should I be prepared to settle for adjunct?",

        "text": "Hi all\n\nI have been working as a research project manager in a large university for the past 2+ years in the UK. Essentially my role entails managing the delivery of a small grant, which means hands on involvement with all aspects of the project such as sorting the approvals, developing study materials, participant recruitment, data collection, data analysis and write up. Not sure if it’s relevant, but I finished my PhD about three years ago.\n\nThe problem is that I think the PI (my line manager) takes advantage of me professionally.  Of course I understand that you have to have a degree of flexibility but these other duties interfere with my workload significantly. Examples of duties I have been tasked that I think are inappropriate:\n\n\\- Writing conference and training event presentations of projects I have had no involvement with\n\n\\- Looking up flights, accommodation and visa requirements for conference travel; some related to the research I’ve had involvement with and some not\n\n\\- Once she stayed in a location of an international conference after the event (which is normal of course). For this, she asked me to compile a list of tourist attractions for her to visit.\n\n\\- Claiming expenses on her behalf\n\n\\- Inducting new staff who were not affiliated with the research I’m involved with (this has happened twice)\n\n\\- Shortlisting candidates out of 108 applications (as above, not affiliated with the research I manage)\n\n\\- Writing a reference for two people who briefly worked with us on my manager’s behalf (signed by her as if the references were from her)\n\n\\- Asking me to use the grant money as a bridging fund for another project briefly (I informed the finance department indirectly who told the PI off for this)\n\n\\- Asking me to organise two focus groups with a marginalised population (=challenging to recruit) in a 2 –week timeframe while she was away – this wasn’t for our project\n\n\\- Asking me to analyse data and write up that section for a report for a project I was not affiliated with – this took an entire week and I received no acknowledgement for this even though that’s not what I was promised at the time\n\n\\- Scheduling meetings for her that are unrelated to our project\n\nI have told some of my peers about these additional tasks I keep getting assigned, and they seem to think they are inappropriate and not part of my job. The problem is that assigning these started very early on so I didn’t feel like I was in a position to say no in a new job. I also think she sensed from the get go that I’m submissive and find saying ‘no’ difficult. To be fair, she often puts me in a position where I don’t really have an opportunity to say no without looking like a d\\*ck, such as copying me into emails saying that I have agreed to help with such and such, when she didn’t even discuss the subject matter with me. On the other hand, in the beginning of my contact I even said I was happy to help which then means that I have contributed to how I’m being treated now. I took part in an assertiveness training course about a year ago, which helped in some other areas but not with this particular issue. Our research team is small, me being by far  most junior. The other team members are senior clinicians or academics.\n\nGenerally speaking my manager and I get along well and she is a nice, warm person otherwise. I find her research very interesting and have gained lots of great experience and skills since starting to work with her. There are other job prospects with her and I would like to carry on working wither her. I just worry that I will always keep on working as her part-time PA, which really frustrates me.\n\nWhat do you think I should do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT.** Wow, I did not expect my post to stir up this much conversation! Reading through the comments was interesting and thanks to those who made constructive suggestions. I realised that perhaps I should have explained more clearly what my role is for further context. I was hired to do all of the practical research for a small grant, which is a clinical feasibility pilot. I'm the only research staff in the team - no one else works on this grant full-time. The Co-Investigators are all academics, whose contributions entail advising on either clinical or academic matters and writing up papers. I'm the same grade as a postdoc or a Lecturer in my institution (I'm not sure what the US equivalent is but based on googling, it might be something like Assistant Professor but please do correct me if I'm wrong). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at my job description, as advised by many of you. It does have two caveats which I suppose do mean that whichever disgruntlements I have can be brushed off with: \"Other administration tasks as appropriate, e.g. photocopying and ordering equipment\" and \"Perform other duties of similar kind appropriate to the grade.\" Of course I knew the job description has something along the these lines but I suppose my irritation arises from the amount of time it is taking me to perform these other tasks in a what is already a busy job. For example, writing presentations about a study I have not worked on takes me a long time as I have to wrap my head around the subject matter, literature, what was done, what was found and what it means. I will have a more careful think about the suggestions that some of you made and see how to exercise assertiveness in this particular context. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It's not too much work (it's not a lecture-based discipline, nor does it require grading papers) which makes the job do-able on top of my other full-time job. However, teaching leaves me little to no time to work in the studio in the evenings after my day job. Of course, for an artist wanting a TT position, you have to make art the way other disciplines have to publish, so staying in the studio is a must. It is also a joy of mine and a place I want to be regardless of whether it will ever lead to a career in academe. \n\nRecently I have been wondering if I am killing myself over the pipe dream of getting a TT job in the humanities. How can I both set myself up for this but always have an exit plan? I want(ed) to stay connected to the university mostly for social/creative reasons (and resume ones too) but our school is very strange-- almost all professors are tenured and because of this, they leave campus as soon as they are done teaching class. The university is just not what I thought (and wished!) it was... When I get to school at 3PM, no one is there. It feels like a weird sort of brain drain, and is very depressing as someone who is looking for a community of creative colleagues. Even though I felt like I graduated with some recognition from faculty, I have been trying to remind myself they they are not my friends and they are not my colleagues. I feel like a lonely drifter who they wouldn't deign to take any sort of interest in, much less collaborate or socialize with. \n\nI am surprised and hurt by how lonely it is to adjunct. And I want to create a life for myself that doesn't feel so hopeless and life sucking. I always thought that the vibrant world of academia would provide a solution. \n\nIf you have any stories or advice, I am all ears!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I have a few middle author publications in great journals (eg PNAS) just not first author. Most of my pubs are in medium-impact journals (eg IF 4-7).\n\nOne of my mentors has warned me that this is probably going to hold me back when I go on the job market, and said that in her department they have never hired someone without at least one such publication.\n\nIs she right?

I asked this question on r/poetry as well, but it means a lot to me so I decided to ask it here as well. \n\nI'm working on a project, but in order for you to get a good picture on what I'm trying to do, I need to give some backstory.\n\nI'm an English undergrad student studying in a school that doesn't give much attention to its English department much at all. The professors teach only theory, and don't delve into the history of literature at all. I'm about to graduate and feel as if I really haven't even learned a thing about the history of English literature (my school does not offer Shakespeare and has only offered Chaucer once in the time I've been there, and I wasn't able to take it) instead they mostly just focus on their own literary theory and not much on students introductions to the field.\n\nThere is one professor of Beowulf however who really inspired me. Before I took his class, I thought that all my field was nothing more than reading stories and learning to write well. He made me realize however, that literature and poetry was more than just stories to be entertained by-- writers can actually encode meaning in their stories, share mankind's values, and even discuss moral problems in sophisticated ways. With him I read poems like Paradise Lost and Beowulf, as well as Shakespearean sonnets and finally took a peek into the vast history of English poetry.\n\nHe told the class that when he was an undergrad, he was told by his professor that in order to get an accurate picture of the English canon, he should read an anthology like the Norton anthology front to back, and so he did just that. He recognized my fascination with this idea, and he gave me a (THICK) book of poems called \"The New Oxford Book of English Verse\". He then retired from the university last semester.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI'm working my way through \"The New Oxford Book of English Verse\" in order to grasp the canon of English verse, and I'm wondering if any veteran readers of poetry have any advice in this sub. I do know how to read poems (my style is reading it once out loud, and then reading it again a few times paying more attention to detail) How should I pace myself? What should I be looking for in reading the poems? Should I research biographical information about the authors and common motifs? Or am I thinking about it too hard, and should I just read.\n\nThanks everyone!",

        "text": "I'm currently using Mendeley on a Mac, which is almost perfect except for the atrocious word plugin. It's slow and clunky, and it is really tough to use when I'm drafting a paper with collaborators. People don't have Mendeley, so when I send out rough drafts for review I have to send it without Mendeley fields. If the citations are messed with, or if major revisions move them out of order, I would have to go back and manually re add all my in text references and regenerate a fresh bibliography. \n\nTo me, a good solution would be if software could do this insert citation process in reverse. In other words, if I were to open a regular Word document that has the same in text citation format and bibliography as my selected citation style, the software would detect these citations and allow me to add new ones to my reference list, automatically change the order of the in text numbering or bibliography, etc. Does any reference software work like this, or is at least less clumsy at inserting citations in word than Mendeley?\n\nI've briefly tried zotero but it seems a lot like Mendeley. I tried Papers 3 as well and this seemed great, but I just can't get the in text citations to work correctly like in their tutorials. Every time I hit format manuscript the old citation key remains and a new one is inserted on the other side of my new in text citation. If I end up formatting the manuscript multiple times I get more and more duplicate citations due to these citation keys not getting removed around the in text citation.\n\nWhat are the current best reference managers?",

I'm interested in the subject matter and experience for its own sake, but am trying to understand the limitations of pursuing that kind of program when it comes to future opportunities.\n\nFor example, how does  a one year masters program in Europe (60 ECTS credits) translate to being recognized in the US and Canada? Such as with universities in Canada for the purposes of teaching (where I've seen restrictions on those not holding masters degrees ), or in government roles for the purposes of compensation (which I've seen with the GS scale in the US federal gov).\n\nOr would it be more beneficial to pursue a 2yr degree in anthro, global development, IR, etc. and simply to focus on disaster/emergency management in thesis and elective work?  This comes with a pretty high opportunity cost in the form of lost income, but could be worthwhile for what it unlocks.\n\nKeen to get any advice, and/or pointers to resources that I might have overlooked.",
