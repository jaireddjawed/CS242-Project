        "text": "Human brains and the way we think and react to things have evolved as we tune in to our environments over millions of years. Many of our emotions are formed by simple survival reactions like fear, sexual attraction and the like. In modern humans, these primal “reptile brain” reactions and instincts are filtered through our highly developed cerebral cortex and are also conditioned by culture\n\n\n. So an alien race, evolving in a totally different environment, with totally different sets of things to react to, and a totally different cultural environment…. Let's just say that the chance of them having an emotional life similar to that of humans would be very small. \n\n\nThis leads to the possibility that, if Aliens exist, they may have evolved to be beings in not empathy or feelings, capable of emphatically torturing other animals on their own planet. They would not have compassion like we humans do. Therefore, if we ever make contact with an extraterrestrial life, we must be careful, as we do not know whether they will be hostil",

This magnificent spiral galaxy is our home in the universe and contains billions of stars and countless mysteries waiting to be unraveled. For many years, astronomers struggled to understand the galaxy’s structure, evolution, and history due to the lack of precise data on its stars. But now, thanks to advancements in technology and space exploration, we now have a better understanding of our galaxy’s structure and evolution. One such breakthrough is the Gaia mission.\n\nLaunched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2013, the Gaia mission aims to chart the positions, distances, and motions of a billion stars in the Milky Way and its neighboring galaxies. With its advanced telescope and imaging sensors, Gaia has been gathering an unprecedented amount of data that has revolutionized our understanding of the Milky Way’s past, present, and future.",

        "author": "ras09191",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/11h1fhz/the_fermi_paradox/",
        "text": "This is a rewrite of a post i wrote long ago.  \n\n\n(Forgive me if it sounds somewhat like a rant)\n\nThe Fermi Paradox is the name for the conflict between the high statistical estimates on the probability of aliens, and the lack of evidence for such aliens. There are numerous possible solutions to this conflict, like for example, that aliens destroy themselves, that aliens dont exist, they are too far away, they are more alien than we think...and so on.  \n\n\nI wanted to share my personal opinion on what is the solution to this conflict. My personal opinion is that aliens are too far away, that our radio searches are pathetic, and that we probably have already detected them. Assuming that the German astrophysicist Sebastian von Hoerner´s assumptions that the average distance between civilizations is 1000 light years is correct, here is some reasons why i believe this solution:  \n\n\n1. As far as I have heard and known, current telescopes find it extremely difficult to observe any Earth-like planets 1000 light years away or further. Take for example Kepler-452b, a potential earth-like superearth, our current telescopes find it very, very hard at the time to try and directly study this superearth. We cant study its atmosphere as it is too remote. This example means that any Earth-like planets that are further than 1000 light years away are probably currently undetected, or if they arent, they cannot be studied until we have sufficiently advanced technology. Kepler 452-b might very well have a civilization like ours right there at this moment, but we just cant actually observe them.  \n\n2. SETI´s radio signal search attempts are honestly, pathetic, but its understandable given the big size of space. Why?  \n\\- They are unable to constantly listen for radio signals on multiple targets (especially multiple planets) for decades. They can either listen to a handful (if not, one) of targets for a year or more, or scan millions of targets for only a small amount of time. We cannot listen to millions of targets for decades, as it would probably be too costly, and probably unwilling. (Why decades? Well, its a realistic timeframe to allow for a radio signal to reach Earth.) \\[source 2\\]  \n\\- The galaxy is vast. It seems that SETI forgets that. A planet is not a star. A planet is a small ball orbiting a much bigger star, which is separated from other stars by hundreds of thousands of astronomical units (and time, too!). For us to ever find a radio signal, we have to just pray to any aliens that they saw our planet, and sent a radio signal directly to it. It must be pointed DIRECTLY at Earth. That means that SETI also must have their telescopes pointed at the correct time this signal arrives. Space is just unfathomably big.   \n\\- Time is a massive factor that is often excluded. Because of time, an alien civilization could have very well sent a signal 1,933 years ago, and went undetected, because we simply were not at the correct time to receive it. An alien civilization could also send a signal in the next 1,405 years. Time is such a massive factor that it is in fact a potential solution on its own to the Fermi Paradox (aliens exist and they are common but they often dont exist at the same time to be detected). This absolutely must be taken into account when searching for radio signals. SETI doesnt seem to do this, and later questions why they did not find a radio signal after listening a target for 25 days.  \n\\- We once scanned 10 million stars for signs of an alien radio source, by guess what? By listening to some region of space for just 17 hours, on the frequency range between 98–128 MHz . Yeah, thats all we did. We attempted to search for an alien signal despite us forgetting how vast space is, how much of a factor time is, how primitive our technology is currently, and how an alien signal would even look like. And we found nothing. Then we acted surprised. We are monkeys when searching for aliens. \\[source 1\\]  \n\n3. On me saying that we have probably already detected them, i present to you, the Wow! signal. Its not much of a surprise, but these are some characteristics that make me believe it is an alien radio signal \\[source 3 for more information\\] :  \n\\- Compared to the background at that time, it was over 30 times stronger than background noise.  \n\\- The radio signal matched expectations of what an alien radio signal would be. \\[source 4\\]. Its intensity gradually peaked for the first 36 seconds, before reaching its peak intensity, then gradually decreased for the next 36 seconds.   \n\n\n[ This was the Wow! signals signal intensity versus time, plotted.](https://preview.redd.it/7r6kti2v1jla1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8e5f6297866e0176edb3c6dd7169f2f0835c716f)\n\n  \n\\- It was detected in the frequency of 1420 megaherts, a frequency that was proposed by   \nscientists that alien civilizations would most likely communicate on, since it is the frequency of   \nhydrogen, the most common element in the entire universe. \\[source 5\\]  \n\\- Considering all the facts i previously talked about about the search for radio signals, the Wow!   \nSignal matches what we would see if we ever detected a radio signal. The most interesting fact   \nthat aligns with the Wow Signal is that any alien radio signals would have to be directed right at   \nour planet in order for us to have a chance to detect it. The fact that this..was headed directly for   \nEarth, is a strong point on why this signal was probably aliens.  \n\\- The comet hypothesis was disproven. \\[source 6\\]  \n\n\nThe fact that this signal was never detected again could potentially make it not alien in origin, but  considering the fact we sent our famous Arecibo message only one time, i find this unlikely to be a game changer.  \n\n\nWith all of this information combined, i personally believe that the Wow! signal was the very first alien radio signal ever received. What i do have in question though is that it appeared to be unmodulated, which is odd for a radio signal being sent into space. I want to know what are the curving lines presented in the plot after the Wow! Signal reached its lowest intensity.  \n\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share my personal opinion on the Fermi Paradox, and on the Wow! Signal, since it was frustrating to me to find it receive so little attention. Feel free to correct me on any information ive provided, or to clarify anything. i believe that we just haven´t advanced enough to find them, because it would be honestly be pretty absurd in the vastness of space, life only evolved once.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSources:  \n1.

Isn’t it possible that the solar system is actually in the middle of being flung out of the galaxy but due to the distance/time scale being so large humans cannot perceive it? Maybe we wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the two scenarios because human time scales are so much shorter and we cannot observe ourselves moving relative to the center of the galaxy in those small time frames (ie human history)?",
