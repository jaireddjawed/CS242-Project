All of the genomes are associated with provenance files that contain links to the NIH Database for each genome, so you can check the results yourself.\n\nI then applied some pretty basic machine learning algorithms to the dataset, and showed that you can quickly and reliably predict someone's ethnicity using their mtDNA alone. These algorithms are so fast, they typically run in a few minutes on a cheap laptop. I also used some more advanced algorithms to explore connections between ethnicities, including ancestral connections between ethnicities. This software takes longer to run, but it all runs in under an hour or so on a cheap machine.\n\nIf you want to analyze your own DNA, you still need someone to actually sequence it, but this is getting cheaper to do, and as a consequence, this software could democratize ethnicity analysis, rather than relying on, e.g., 23andMe, or some other corporate provider.\n\nAll of the software is free for non-commercial purposes, and there are links to both the software and the dataset in the paper below.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/365210380_Vectorized_Computational_Genomics\n\nEnjoy!",

        "text": "For example, I see many supplements that market collagen supplements as being good for skin. Of course collagen is an important component of skin and other tissues, however, I don't see the connection between eating supplements or food with collagen with improving skin. AFAIK, consumed collagen will be digested by GI proteases like trypsin, enteropeptidase, etc. So yes, the amino acids that make up collagen will be available for use by the body to produce new collagen in the skin, but I think it is disingenuous to market dietary collagen as directly increasing collagen.\n\nAnother example would be Bromelain supplements or recommendations for people to eat pineapples as a way to alleviate osteoarthritis. Bromelain is a protease enzyme in pineapples, but again this will be cleaved into amino acids in the GI tract. How would this enzyme help in osteoarthritis? \n\nFinally, dietary enzyme supplements work for supplementing low endogenous enzyme levels, such as in people with pancreatic insufficiency or lactose intolerance. But these proteins and enzymes work specifically in the GI tract, not absorbed into the body to work in the skin, joints, brain etc. \n\nAm I wrong? Going further, how are prion diseases transmitted through food like human mad cow disease(CJD)? Shouldn't these prion chaperones be digested in the GI tract before they can reach the brain?",

        "text": "There's a growing movement in France around using thermal contraception. The idea is to keep your testicles in the inguinal canal for 15 hours a day (the testicles are not made to operate at body temperature which is why they hang lower in the scrotum). The body temperature heat slowly damages all the germ cells so that healthy sperm are not produced. Sperm count, motility, and DFI (DNA fragmentation index) are affected so that over several weeks the male becomes infertile. Limited human studies show reversibility of sperm damage up to 4 years of continued use (the data in the studies doesn't go past that). Shorter-term animal studies also show reversibility.\n\nHowever, the focus is always on the sperm. Nobody seems to care about the Leydig cells which produce important hormones like testosterone. Most animal and human data show that hormone levels stay steady while inducing artificial cryptorchidism (aka. keeping the testes in the inguinal canal). The available data shows that this is not what it seems though: the heat stress damages the Leydig cells so that they don't produce as much testosterone. This is compensated by the body producing more Leydig cells so that the serum levels stay constant. So a blood test would suggest that everything is fine, but examining the Leydig cells themselves would paint a more accurate picture.\n\nThe big question is: is this damage to the Leydig cells reversible? All the studies that I find don't see to care to answer this question. All of the focus is on sperm cell damage reversibility, not Leydig cell damage reversibility. I'm hoping someone with a background in this can answer. Thanks.",

It makes sense since tight junctions in the body are formed by epithelial cells, which are absent inside the joint cavity.\n\nHowever, here is also a recent study that says the synovial membrane in joints DOES have tight junctions in it, and it is formed by macrophage cells. They even provided the picture of how the tight junction is like in the synovial membrane.\n\nhttps://sci-hub.se/10.1038/d41586-019-02340-x\n\nhttps://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-019-02340-x/d41586-019-02340-x_17034430.jpg\n\nSo which one is right? Apparently one of the two articles has to be wrong, unless the tight-junctions mentioned in both articles are actually refering to two different things, with completely different functions.",

I graduated from college a few years ago with a Bachelors in Biology. Final GPA 2.8. I've been working the last few years at a hospital doing administrative work but it's mostly unrewarding.\n\nThings I'm looking for:\n\nMinimal time back in school (1-3 years), 6 figure potential in the next 5 years, mostly independent work can have some team input/consulting, minimal consumer/customer/patient interaction if possible, and relatively low stress I'm open to somewhat stressful roles if they pay more. For context I live in California. Thank you!",

I would like to explore different opportunities in this subject, whether it’s as a second job, or perhaps the career I ultimately decide upon.\n\nNevertheless, I know both a CJUS and some form of environmental science study is required for many Wardens, so it’s already a plus and on par with my goals. \n\nMy dilemma is which one would be idea in the sense of promotions and challenges. I want to pursue something that will give me every opportunity to better understand the cycles of nature and wildlife, but also of something as small insects. \n\nThank you, and once again, I apologize if this is the wrong sub to be inquiring. :)",
