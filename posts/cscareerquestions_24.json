But when they gave me my offer letter the title had change to Automation Engineer but with the same duties. I’ve asked to the recruiter if it was a mistake but she told me that is the title they handle inside the company, but the duties are exactly the same, I’ll be working as a contractor so the job title is different inside the company and with the contractors. \n\nFor those who want to know the duties, here: \n\n1. Software Development/maintenance of internal testing tools (Desktop and web-based tools).\n2. Update of Matlab models to accommodate required simulation of features on the Test environments for all the projects.\n3. Python development to integrate IOS, Android and Web devices with Test Automated stations.\n4. Develop and maintain software tools and features to assist in automated testing.\n\nAll my internship experience is based on fullstack (C#, PHP backend and Angular/React Front), but I’m excited to code professionally in a language I love a lot, Python.

When I read more chapters I will update this guide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Determine what you have to build   \n\\* Ask clarifying questions, to get a better idea of how the system of this should look like...  \n\\* I.e. Which part of Twitter are we going to focus on today?   \n\\* Or are we going to talk about it as a whole? \n2. Draw a very basic Frontend | Backend | DB Diagram.  \n\\* No details here, just a USER | then the Services (draw a cloud around it) | and then a DB\n3. Discuss a bit about the Features that you were asked to build  \n\\* What kind of API's will this system provide?  \n\\* What kind of Entities will you have in the DB?  \n\\* What are some KEY components of the LOGIC to implement this System? For example: PayServ or MessageServ, or /upload or /fetch etc.\n4. Once you have a decent grip on the basic things that are needed for your design, it's time to extrapolate for Scale. This is where you introduce the fancy tools:  \n\\* CDN ?  \n\\* LoadBalancer?  \n\\* Cache?  \n\\* Again - staying pretty shallow here -- not in too much depth.\n5. DB In Depth  \n\\* Look at your DB and start talking about all the different ways you can:  \n\\-- Replicate a Database   \n\\-- Partition A Database   \n\\-- Pros / Cons of Each (Discuss Availability, Discuss Failover, Discuss Opp Conflict Resolution)  \n\\-- Consistency Models of Each\n6. Determine your Access Patterns -- is this Application going to be Write Heavy or Read Heavy  \n\\-- Suggest some DB Partitioning/replication Strategy that is good for WRITE or READ Heavy App  \n\\-- Explain how the Partitioning and Replication and Consistency Model you have chosen satisfies the requirement logically.\n7. Go in more depth about LOGIC of the application, how everything gets served. From request to response, and talk about the things it goes through in each step. Filling in more details as needed as you do this.",

Raising important technical problems early and providing possible solutions? Instead, he's treating me like I don't know my stuff and I should have better prepared the proposal.\n\nThose two leads do not understand how SQL engine works. They don't understand the data structures of indexes and how that is read.

So I checked earlier with company that a internal shift to SDE is possible and joined them with the plan to internally convert to SDE.  \n\n\n**Jul-2021:**  \nI started as fulltime Graduate SDET in the same company.  \nI'm working on multiple projects, automating tests, contributing stuff.  \n\n\n**Jan-2022:**  \nI try to shift to SDE.  \nBut we don't get any new interns, due to not finding any good enough candidates. So I am told I will have to be a SDET until we have enough resources in automation to handle things without me.\n\nIn addition to SDET tasks, I get to directly work on testing servers and DBs, handling common server side issues, writing DB scripts for managing test data(PostgreSQL), etc.  \nI work on improving UI in tests reports and do some hands on FE work.  \nI'm a Team Champion, High performer, yada yada yada, still a SDET.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oct-2022:**  \nI get promoted to Associate SDET from Graduate SDET. New hires in the team.  \nProcess of my migration to SDE is discussed and it is decided: I will be moving to Frontend team starting Jan-2023, when new set of interns come to my current team.  \n\n\n**Jan-2023:**  \nI have done my react projects, learnt my hooks. My onboarding to the dev team begins.   \nA week later, company is losing clients, cost cutting, and mass layoff. Internal politics happens and I am one among the hundreds that are laid off and I am told \"It is not due to my performance but solely due to company's performance\".  \n\n\n**My salary situation:**\n\nThe pay I was getting was a little higher than even the developers with same amount of experience in the company. And it is quite higher than the average pay of SDETs with same amount of experience get in India.  \n\n\n**But now I am confused if I should**:\n\n1. Find a new SDET job with same salary, and hope I will be a SDE some day\n2. Try to find a SDE job if I can, with a very high chance of a massive pay decrease(I am fine with up to 25% decrease)  \n\n\n**Why I want to be a SDE:**\n\nAs a SDE I see myself designing things, architecting projects, building products. As an SDET I don't see myself doing anything that are very far from what I was already doing in my job.   \nAnd as years pass, salary gap between a good SDE and good SDET increases by a lot.\n\nMy skills:\n\n* Java: 8/10\n* JS: 7/10\n* Python: 6/10\n* React 16.8+: 7/10\n* Thinking and designing the React way: 4/10\n* SQL: 6/10\n* I had learnt Express, MongoDB a while ago but would need a refresher on those\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Started working as SDET, with the hope of internally shifting to SDE. After almost 2 years as SDET, as onboarding to SDE finally started I am laid off and I am now jobless.",

I have a friend who is a Quantitative Analyst and the math he does and then subsequently codes for his ML algorithms is insane. I can understand what’s going on, I can even code what he’s talking about but I’d need to go back to school to learn the level of math he’s doing. \n\nIt’s made me consider maybe focusing on data engineering or ML ops instead of reaching for ML engineer because I’m thinking I’m still 2 years of hardcore math studying to compete. \n\nSo my question is, how much math is really required to be a competitive ML engineer?

I like the dual job, keeps my days interesting On the technical side I feel like I'm not learning enough though. \n\nWe are coding in JavaScript / TypeScript and don't work with any of the currently popular frameworks. And the work itself is not challenging enough to get to a more advanced level in TypeScript. I get lots of messages from recruiters on LinkedIn when they see how long I've been working as a developer, but I feel like I don't have enough skills to go at those mid-level / senior developer roles.\n\nThis is why I'm planning to up my skills both during work and outside of work. I was thinking of learning the fundamentals of JavaScript first then moving to TypeScript, truly mastering all of the theory and documentation and implementing in my current job wherever I can. I'm confident to code away with these two skills now, but I want to ensure future employers that I'm an expert.\n\nWhat is making it a bit tricky now is that I eventually want to grow more towards iOS app development, which means I will need to learn coding in Swift at some point.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1) How would you go about this? Directly dive into iOS app development or take a route of first truly mastering what you're doing in web development with JavaScript / TypeScript - maybe even adding a framework to that?\n\n2) In case you would go for the latter: would a roadmap of 1,5 months mastering JavaScript, 3 months mastering TypeScript and then 6 months mastering Swift and iOS development be a good path to follow?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11ewyaf/best_way_to_teach_myself_programming_and_start/",
        "text": "Hey all,\n\nJust to let you know, I'm committed to try and get a programming job with the no degree route, not any degree. I'm pretty sure I have the aptitude and, even knowing it's going to be much much harder, I think I can do it. It also helps that I know a lot of people, including many close friends who are SWEs, so I can get a lot of referrals.\n\nI've heard over and over again that the best way to land interviews with the added hurdle of not having a degree is to have a great portfolio, also contributing to open source projects (is that the same thing?) The main purpose of this question/post is to figure out if I should learn some basics/fundamentals before I start trying to build a portfolio, or if I should just learn along the way.\n\nAnyways, I just want to know what's the best way to get started I guess. I'm not a total beginner, I've coded some stuff like FSMs in C, some stuff in python like a program that solves word searches given a dictionary and a grid of letters, I also have done some stuff in C++. I can code merge sort, binary search, DFS for a graph, and some other stuff.\n\nMy main concern is that I don't really have very much experience implementing OOP, since I've mainly just written functions or simple programs. I have done it before in C++, but just not at a very large scale at all and only in very simple ways to illustrate concepts like inheritance and polymorphism. Also, like I mentioned, I know some algorithms and I've used some data structures, but my college friends seem to make a big deal out of data structures &amp; algorithms, so I'm just not sure how I make that \"solid\" for myself.\n\nI watched a youtube video from a guy who told his story how he became a very accomplished programmer with no cs degree, he mentioned that he found Harvard's CS50 and it's sequel course very helpful as a starting point. I started going through the course and, despite working almost 40 hours a week and having a good amount of commitments outside of work, I've been blowing through it. I've been completing all the problem sets choosing the \"more comfortable\" option every week and 2 weeks in I'm on week 5 in the course. I'm beginning to wonder though, is going through CS50 worth my time if my goal is to land a job asap without a degree? One thing the guy mentioned in the video is that it can serve as a good introduction to a few different stacks of coding, front end, back end, full stack, etc., and so it can help you find what area of programming you enjoy.\n\nIs this a good starting point? Am I wasting my time? Should I just start looking for projects to contribute to on github? What ground work do I need to lay before I just start building a portfolio?\n\nI would really appreciate ya'll's guidance. Thanks in advance :)\n\nAlso one sidenote: my friend who used to work at Rivian and is now working at SpaceX has been saying I should get into DevOps. I have heard that AWS/Azure certificates are more valuable than other sort of online programming certificates, which are apparently useless. So would DevOps, be the easiest place to land a job without a degree since you can give yourself some (even if only a little more) cred with certificates that do something as opposed to other areas of programming??",

Apparently someone from my class posted the programming assignment to Chegg and someone responded with the full code for it. So admittedly I added the stuff I struggled with into my own code. Now I didn't realize until AFTER I already submitted the dropbox that requires us to put our source code that even though i wasn't the one who posted the assignment on chegg and even tho i only used it as a reference to see if i was doing the assignment right, that I could get in trouble since the person who posted it is prob gonna copy and paste the entire code into their assignment so my code is gonna be looking very similar to theirs. Now im scared shitless. Do u guys think i will get in trouble?",

Was able to double major in Business Information Systems and Supply Chain Management, though if I could have afforded to take extra semesters I would have pursued CS. \n\nMy first job out of college was as a Scrum Master (solely coaching, no actual technical work). Wasn't feeling fulfilled after a year and took an opportunity to join Salesforce and be a salesperson in software sales. The culture is terrible and I am trying to get back into the technical field. I get so drained I can't even focus on self-studying in the evenings/weekends. \n\nAs someone who is approaching close to two years of being removed from graduation, what paths would you recommend I try?\n\n I've applied to companies like Dev10, Revature, etc, and have a Data Engineering offer. This would make me move but allow me to work at the same company I previously was a Scrum Master at. Would be a contract worker at a lower salary and then eventually get converted (have to pay an exit fee if I leave beforehand, typical body-shop deal). I'd plan to take evening classes to obtain a post-bacc in CS or a Masters in Cyber Security and get certifications in AWS, Comptia, etc. \n\nThe other option I am considering is to just go back to school entirely and obtain a post-bacc in CS to allow me to apply to internships and new grad roles. Is there a difference between doing an online degree vs in person one from the view of career opportunities/networking events? \n\nIf you have any other opinions please let me know! I only have some knowledge in python but nothing that I think would allow me to get jobs anywhere. Are there any types of roles I could consider with just a BIS degree? It seems that BIS is honestly a terrible return on investment for career paths. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny opinions/advice is appreciated.",

I was sorta confused what this was about, so I asked if he had any specific examples of what he was talking about. He had none.\n\nBasically he told me that it was just a shift in mindset and that I needed to pay attention, and that it’s an issue with my soft skills. And he told me to take more notes. Wouldn’t give me specific examples for some reason. But he said it will make me an overall stronger developer, if I'm able to pay attention to the little things and the details.\n\nHonestly, and I swear on this; normally my hard technical skills are the issue. I’m not exactly the most passionate coder, but I think I do a decent enough job. Maybe a little slow on throughout.\n\nI assumed he was talking about my code, so I asked if it was in regard to specific tickets or code reviews, and he basically just shifted into making it more of a mindset and being more conscious of it. A completely non-technical perspective. \n\nI’ve never really had this kind of interaction with a boss or a higher up. Normally I’ve been told I do a pretty good job. Especially in soft skills, that’s how I land these jobs, because I have decent soft skills and present myself as moldable. Which I think I am, which is why I’m going to make a conscious effort to “pay more attention to details” (whatever that means)\n\nCan anyone help me dissect what he means when he’s saying this?",

At this point I did not have an offer from company B so I took it. Today the bonus paid out, $9800 hit my account. I also just got the offer from company B for 26k more than my current job at company A and I’m going to take it. \n\nWhat happens with the 15k? I need to repay it but what happens with taxes?",

        "text": "Hi all, just looking for some general advice here regarding career prospects following a re-org. For some context, I'm a new-grad who has been working on this team for about 6 months now. The team I joined is on the larger side, about 10 people. I haven't been given any projects yet other than small operations related tasks like integration tests, pipeline automation, dependency upgrades, oncall, etc. Have been told this is normal and I accept that, but I feel like I'm not really coding &amp; not really improving my skills. I've indicated that I'd like to code more but don't want to be pushy &amp; not act like a team player, as all work is necessary and helpful. Team also has a lot of bandwidth so they seem to be okay letting me slowly ramp up. \n\nFollowing some layoffs, our director inherited a bunch new services. So most of our team members + manager are going away to help with the transition and own the new stuff. It includes all the people who have been here longest and know the services best. The few of us remaining &amp; our services are being merged into our sister team. So we will have to maintain our existing stuff, learn new services, and teach the new team members about our stuff. And I'm still learning how our services work (we have a lot). But I will probably be more valuable. \n\nMy team had great work life balance but I felt like I wasn't learning much. I am considering switching teams if I can find any open reqs (that alone could stop me, but let's pretend it's possible as I do know a few people hiring internally). I think this is a good time to switch with so much change happening anyway. But I'm unsure if a re-org like this actually presents me with a good opportunity to step up and be a bigger contributor. Getting promoted within 2 years is achievable if I get enough projects to demonstrate my abilities, but I'm worried I'm not progressing on that front. \n\nDoes anyone have advice for this situation? Is a re-org good for my prospects? Should I leave or stay? Any tips on how to best approach the integration with the new team, if I stay? Thanks!",
