        "text": "For 25+ years, One Piece has been the juggernaut of Weekly Shōnen Jump. With it “ending” sometime soon, I feel like the WSJ team is forcing Oda to keep the story going until they figure out which title can take its place. They’ll NEED a massive ongoing title to keep the ship sailing for years to come (no pun intended). Does that mean a passing of the torch to Fujimoto and Chainsaw Man?\n\nAlso, Japanese TV networks will be hungry for a new show that can fill that programming block on a weekly basis. They need the ratings and ad revenue that One Piece has been able to consistently bring in. Does that mean Hunter x Hunter or Bleach will have to fill that void?\n\nWhat do you think will happen? Will Togashi start serializing weekly again and help create new episodes of HxH? Maybe Kubo pens some new Bleach chapters and keeps the anime going beyond TYBW?",

        "text": "****SPOILERS****\n\n\nI hate to say this, but I hope Garp dies.\n\nNow here me out, I love Garp, I think the fact that he simply just wanted his grandkids to be marines was so they were relatively safe, but currently he is fighting Blackbeard. Look at all of the final villains luffy will have to face: Imu, Akainu, and Blackbeard. Now I highly doubt Sabo is dead because I feel like Oda wouldn’t just kill him without giving more details (unless he does so down the line), but if sabo is dead that would mean that: akainu killed luffy’s brother, Imu killed Luffy’s Other brother, and (this is another part of a different theory) Blackbeard realized he need to get his third devil fruit after getting whooped by Law, he got a third devil fruit in time for Garp to arrive to save Koby and he ends up killing Garp (or to be exact Garp dies as a sacrifice to save Koby). That would mean the 3 main villains of Luffy have all killed a member of his family, and ultimately have killed his entire family (Dragon don’t count). I think this is how luffy will directly go to take down Imu. \n\nNow this last part is iffy, it may possibly be that luffy reaches laugh tale and claims the one piece, and the world government doesn’t want to give that moral boost to pirates and people against the government, so they release the fact that Sabo has been killed, Luffy eventually finds out (probably from Robin reading the paper) and this is where Luffy finally decides that the World Government can’t stand any longer.",

        "text": "I was reminded of the differences of the Worst Generation vs. a Supernova. And weirdly Law isn't a Supernova. And real quick lets go over the differences (because sometimes people mix them up) :\n\nWorst Generation : The group of pirates who rose to fame the same year as Luffy (right before the Summit War). This includes : Luffy, Zoro, Teach, Bege, Bonney, Hawking, Apoo, Kid, Killer, Urouge, X Drake, and Trafalgar.\n\nSupernova (or Super Rookie) : is a rookie pirate who has earned 100,000,000 beri bounty. This includes all of the Worst Generation except for Teach. Other Supernovas are : Ace, the Caribou brothers, Cavendish, and Barolomeo (who are all from different generations than the \"worst\"). Also fun fact : Rockstar was first shown with a bounty of 94,000,000 and later referred to as a super rookie, meaning he probably had a bounty increase.\n\n**Now onto Law** :\n\nLaw started Piracy as a child when he joined the Donquiote Pirates. Even after leaving them, he started the Heart Pirates when he met Bepo Shachi and Penguin as kids. So by the year of the Summit War, Law has been a pirate for a long time.\n\nThe story is similar to Shanks, Blackbeard, and Buggy who spent time as a kid on a pirate ship before embarking on their own. And they aren't Supernovas. Just like Law isn't a rookie.",

        "text": "The reason why I think they should have been dead is for consistency in the story and for better characterization. I do not hate these characters. I just think that it would have been a better decision to kill them rather than have them alive.\n\n1. Pell - Well, I think I do not need to explain why he should have died after getting nuked\n\n2. Usopp - Everyone says he will die somehow in the future, but I think he better died at Enies Lobby when he was in his PRIME. Yeah, Usopp was at his peak in Enies Lobby.\n\n3. Smoker - Last time we saw him in Punk Hazard. No, further development about him. Do not either think he will be a \"threat\" to Luffy. He was not a threat at Punk Hazard either. Oda could give this man good character development, some flashbacks, and a death scene like Whitebeard or Pedro.\n\n4. Spandam - Bro, Robin literally destroyed his bones. Why the fuck did not Oda just announce him dead? What will he even do afterward in the story?\n\n5. Law - In my opinion, his character arc ended in Dressrossa. Doflamingo shot him countless times, he was alive though. I would prefer Law dead than him getting an absurd and ridiculous power-up in Wano. Anyways, he still seems to be going to die, lol\n\n6. Bon Kurei - Same with others. How could he be alive after facing Magellan? Ivankov was not there, so a little poison from Magellan should have been enough to kill him. It would have been nicer if he died like Pedro. I hope Pedro will not show up in the future.\n\n7. Red Scabbards - Especially Kinemon. How could Oda manage to make him alive? Kaido should have killed them on the roof. Before the raid, they say they are ready to give up on their life (even Kaido tells this to Kinemon), but Oda just kills two of them OFFSCREEN!!\n\nWhat is your opinion on this?",

I don’t think gear 5 is a form were this ‘sun god’ takes over his body partially. Gear 5 is more like a doping like gear 2. Just like what happens with the sulong form and the energy steroids (also both white and red eyes, coincidence?). Oda said before that awakened zoan users cannot change their environment. Awakened paramecia users can, just like luffy does. But I don’t know why Luffy needs to be in this Gear 5 state to change the environment. Katakuri can do it without a transformation for example. I think of Gear 5 as a state were Luffy goes berserk, and his rubber abilities are only limited to his imagination, even before Gear 5. So Luffy going berserk is just his imagination taking over, that’s why he acts so goofy. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "Here are some facts:\n\n- There are 5 confirmed VOAT users in the story and the Three-Eye tribe that can use the ability. Ignoring the Three-Eye tribe, the confirmed users are Luffy, Roger, Oden, Momo, and Shirahoshi. \n\n- Shirahoshi and Momo are the only two who’ve had conversations with sentient animals using the ability. Luffy, Roger, and Oden have only heard Zunesha/the Sea Kings but have been ignored when shouting to them. The Sea Kings have confirmed to hear Roger and Luffy.\n\n- We know that Shirahoshi is the reincarnation of Poseidon. Momo and Oden are the inheritors of Pluton and Zunesha. Momo is to bring the Dawn to the world w/ Luffy’s &amp; Co. Luffy has been acknowledged by Zunesha (after ignoring him originally) to be Joy Boy/Nika.\n\n\nFrom the information I’ve gathered, I’ve noticed a correlation with this ability: ignoring Oden and Roger (due to page/scene time), all of the VOAT users have a relationship with animal or animals. \n\nShirahoshi is a mermaid and has befriended Surume, Megalo, and the Sea Kings. Momo is a dragon and a friend of the entire Mink tribe. Luffy’s family name is Monkey, has Chopper in his crew, and has been shown making friends with animals as far back as Orange Town. \n\nThe difference between Momo/Shirahoshi and Luffy interacting using the VOAT, is receiving acknowledgement. Only Momo and Shirahoshi have been able to give orders using the ability. Luffy, while being able to hear the voices, has yet to receive a response from one of these sentient animals. So it begs the question - why can’t Luffy have a converse/command these beings but Momo/Shirahoshi can?\n\nConsidering the facts I’ve laid out, we can infer that these VOAT users have a special relationship with Sentient animals where they will only listen to one specific user. While It hasn’t been confirmed, Momo can’t give the Sea Kings an order just as Shirahoshi can’t give Zunesha an order. \n\nTo wrap this up, I believe the Egg on Roger’s ship to linked to Luffy as it’s controller. They both have the VOAT ability and Luffy has inherited Roger’s will. The Egg was given a lot of screen time during the Oden flashback and was shown to be on the Oro Jackson before &amp; after Raftel. Considering it seems like the Roger Pirates we’re waiting for it to hatch and that Luffy is the only VOAT user without a connection, I believe the Egg will hatch for Luffy and will only be able to converse with him.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "When I first got into OP in 2011 it seemed like One Piece Wiki and regular Wikipedia had a few different names for various arcs, and even divided arcs where one of them might have listed just one arc.\\* At the time the wiki broke down the One Piece Sagas as follows:\n\nEast Blue Saga, which consisted of the Captain Morgan Arc, the Buggy the Clown Arc, the Captain Kuro Arc, the Baratie Arc, the Arlong Arc and the Logue Town arc. \n\nBaroque Works Saga\n\nSky Island Saga\n\nCP9 Saga\n\nWhitebeard War Saga, which included the Thriller Bark Arc. Even at the time I recall some sources claiming the latter was actually the Paramount War Saga or the War of the Best Saga.\n\nSeveral years later the wiki changed some of the Saga and arc names. The Baroque Works Saga was now the Alabasta Saga, Sky Island was the Skypeia Saga, Cp9 was the Water 7 Saga and the Whitebeard War Saga was now the Summit War Saga. The East Blue arcs were also listed differently. The Captain Morgan Arc was now the Romance Dawn Arc, the Buggy arc was Orange Town Arc, the Kuro arc was Syrup Village Arc and Arlong Arc was now Arlong *Park*. Additionally, Thriller Bark was now its own Saga, not part of the War Saga\n\nWhat's the deal? What are the Arcs and Sagas supposed to be called?\n\n\\*E.g. where onepiece.wikia mentioned the Alabasta arc Wikipedia at one point claimed everything up until Ace left was its own arc and then everything after was another arc.\n\nP.S. Similarly, I remember some source claiming the chapters during the journey to Enies Lobbey was its own arc whereas most sources I saw simply state the Water 7 arc being followed by the Enies Lobbey arc.",

        "text": "I've noticed a misconception growing within the community. I saw it in a thread about Franky and his lack of focus in Egghead, and several other threads.\n\n# \"Zoro barely did anything in the Wano arc.\"\n\nWhat? lol\n\nLook I'm not defending Wano, but I find it amusing how the community can be so forgetful when they focus on just the negative and forget all the good, which leads to statements like the above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkip down to TLDR for summary but I want to point out and remind you all just how much of a role Zoro played in Wano for those that think he did nothing or had barely any focus.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# FIGHTS/BATTLE/FEATS:\n\n*ZORO VS SUPERNOVAS--*\n\n* Zoro fought 4 Supernovas, in just one arc.\n\n\\- Zoro vs Hawkins\n\n\\- Zoro vs Killer\n\n\\- Zoro vs Apoo\n\n\\- Zoro vs Drake\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*ZORO VS YONKOUS--*\n\n* Zoro was able to not only fight on the rooftop against Big Mom and Kaido, but he also had the biggest impact on the rooftop against the Yonkous.\n\n\\- Saved Luffy several times (7 in fact in total just on the roof)\n\n\\- Momentarily stopped the strongest attack in the series (as of chapter 1009), saving 4 lives\n\n\\- Showed he learned to cut fire; new sword skill acquired\n\n\\- Cut Kaido scales in Dragon Form; countered Kaido Dragon Twister with his own Dragon Twister\n\n\\- Permanently scarred Hybrid Kaido, replicating a feat that got Oden placed in the \"Are you saying you are just as great as they are\" panel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ewr5744lyla1.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9dceead61d84b9e258ca7e7bf610f7e5bfcc7edb\n\n*ZORO VS COMMANDERS--*\n\n* Not only did Zoro get a really cool moment against Queen where he destroys his weapon, but he also got his own main 1 v 1 with King where he learns to overcome Lunarian Toughness, learns the true nature of named/cursed blades, and learns to come to terms with the reality that he aspires to be a King too, and that is what it takes to be one step closer to his dream.\n\n# STORY FOCUS:\n\n* Zoro had the closest and most interactions out of SH's with the \"princess\" of the Wano arc (Hiyori), and helped train Momo. We haven't really seen something like that for Zoro before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Zoro had the closest and most interactions with Yasuie and his daughter Toko, out of SH's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Zoro showed personal interest and emotion for Wano citizens' disfigurement from SMILE that plagued them and hit very hard by Yasuie death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Zoro lost his Black Blade Shushui, and gained a new sword in Wano called \"Death\" or \"Enma\". That is a big deal he does not commonly change Swords.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Zoro's character develops as a swordsman during King's fight through introspection, learning what it means to be tested by a Sword, the true nature of cursed blades, what it means to be master the sword. His title even changes at the end of Wano to \"Sword Master\" for the first time.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTLDR: \n\nZoro arguably did the most in the arc. He fought many supernovas, he fought all the Yonkou, he fought with Commanders, he had a better story investment than he has had in previous arcs. Yes, he did not get to see Ryumas Grave, yes, he did not get his lineage explored in the arc, but to say he barely did anything or had no focus is just false.\n\nAnd to be completely honest, I am not too disappointed about his lineage/family not being a central defining focus of his character.",

        "text": "So I recently started one piece and I am on Sabody arc. I have been enjoying the show but I feel that while story has gotten more interesting, the main characters have regressed. \n\nSo first off, I feel that the characters personalities went completely down the drain recently. Like Sanji used to be some interesting character who had a motive of going to the all blue but I feel like the writers have just turned his whole personality to Brock from Pokémon where all he does is simp over girls which I don't necessarily mind but just not literally all the time. I also feel that they changed Luffy but I cant exactly put a pin on what they changed, he just doesn't give the same vibe anymore, feels like he isn't as silly as he used to be. Also Usopp used to be more intresting pre-water7, he wasnt strong but he always found small ways to help the crew but now I feel he doesnt do that anymore. I thinks it because they added so much people to the crew so they cant really focus on a character specifically anymore because they are trying to give every crewmate screen time. \n\nSecondly, I feel that they try way to hard to make characters seem \"badass\". Like how Sanji has to smoke a cigarette literally before he does anything, I don't know why but that really makes me cringe when he does that. Its also annoying when they blackout the eyes of everyone to make them seem serious or cool. Or when they fight somebody and they show a shot of every crewmate sweating or struggling against an enemy even though half of them have barely contributed at all.  \n\nIdk I'm probably overcritical and I'm still enjoying the show but I feel that the characters specifically have regressed since like alabasta but the plot has gotten better,",

Shanks gave the strawhat to Luffy knowing that he ate the fruit.\n\nAlso, Sun shines directly towards Uranus' half/pole for 21 years and will took 21 years for it to rotate(somehow related to what Roger said to Rayleigh \"turn the world upside-down\". Luffy is 19 years old. What if we will get another 2 years time-skip for him to turn the world upside down as the Roger pirate said \"they were too early\".. Also Uranus is one of two planets that revolves differently from other planets together with Venus.\n\nP.S. Add some facts to this to make it a good theory, I just saw the picture of Uranus and i imagined the straw hat immediately lol.",

He appeared in Wano during this section too, it wasn’t within the main Wano arc. \n\nBut not only making it about Shanks, I just think we’re getting heaps of world-building events within this arc, so is it an extended world building arc, or is this the way forward, where we’ll get outside information within arcs? \n\nI’m all for it by the way haha",
