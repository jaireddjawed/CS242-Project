Here's why:\n\n\n\n\n1)  The Mall\n\n\n\nI REALLY liked the secret base under the Starcourt Mall and the mall itself. While the Hawkins Lab was a building practically closed off to the public and overall shady looking just from the exterior alone, the mall presented itself as innocent. Who would think there's scientists working beneath them trying to open gates to alternate dimensions? It was the perfect disguise. The mall and the Russians were appropriate for the 80s setting, while also providing a plot twist for those who watched the previous seasons, realizing that Murray wasn't 100% right about the Russian girl but correct when it came to Russians invading Hawkins.\n\n\n\n2)  The Aesthetic\n\n\n\nI mean, what's not to love? Neon lights... bright clothes... awesome! I particularly enjoyed scenes in The Void when Eleven would remote travel. The colors she wore and saw popped out well with the plain black surroundings. It was a nice break from the brown and beige feeling of the first two seasons.\n\n\n\n\n3)  The Plot\n\n\n\nThe conflict between Jonathan and Nancy is a great example. The Wheelers live comfortably, while Jonathan comes from a different side of down, so he definitely needs the Hawkins Post job more than Nancy does. On the other hand, his frustrations lead him to dismiss Nancy's misogynistic treatment at the hands of the higher-ups.\n\n\nWill not being able to grow up as fast as his friends are is also a great part of his character. Mike, Lucas, and Dustin are supportive, but it is impossible for them to understand what Will has been through with the Upside Down. These misunderstandings led to Will destroying Castle Byers out of despair, and honestly, that scene was really powerful to me.\n\n\nThe Mind Flayer building a weapon to stop Eleven, rather than building an army, was fascinating to me. He created a weapon to stop a weapon!\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, that's my opinion. What do you guys think?","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678569305.0},{"title":"Is it possible that it\u2019s not actually Will in the normal world?","author":"No-Transition2321","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/11oy5b1\/is_it_possible_that_its_not_actually_will_in_the\/","text":"So I\u2019m watching stranger things rn, and I noticed that Fred and Chrissy\u2019s bodies were in Vecna\u2019s lair\u2026 and it\u2019s likely that Vecna was in season 1 too.

Their dad Lonnie is coming from Indianapolis with his girlfriend Cynthia, so Jonathan has to make sure his mom Joyce doesn\u2019t get too worked up with getting everything ready for the party. Melvald\u2019s is lending Joyce a hand with free supplies at least.\n\nJonathan doesn\u2019t want to ask Will's friends about gift ideas in case they end up blowing the surprise somehow. So Jonathan finds unlikely help from Mr Clarke, Will\u2019s science teacher, who is helping Will and his friends with their upcoming science project on volcanic eruption.\n\nJonathan already knows what Will likes as far as games, movies, music and comics, but he wants to get Will something truly unexpected. Mr Clarke has an idea since Will drew something in class depicting author Steven King and he has a friend that knows Steven and can get him to write a personal birthday message to Will. But for it to arrive on time, Jonathan will have to pick it up.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678419726.0},{"title":"Just found where they got the Hawkins Lab alarm sound from","author":"CAMMzero","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/11mxxld\/just_found_where_they_got_the_hawkins_lab_alarm\/","text":"I randomly decided to watch the movie BASEketball and I hear the Hawkins alarm after they win their first game.

I'm already done with all 4 seasons, so don't worry with spoilering me, I guess I should be worried about spoilering anyone with this post.\n\nIt has been a month or so, since I've seen the last episode of Season 4 and I'm gonna be talking about that episode now, so beware of any spoilers, if you haven't seen it yet.\n\nI just think, I kinda need to do that to process through my emotions. And like, I know this is just a TV show, but some shows and movies and their characters I hold so dearly in my heart, that I tend to get a little emotional at times. Same with Stranger Things. From the very first episode on I (and my mother, I've actually been watching ST with my mother) have been so invested and I could see, what all the fuss was all about.\n\nBut wow, could anyone have prepared me for the season 4 finally? \nThroughout season 4 it was incredible enough seeing how much these children grew up, but seeing them having to go through so much trauma AGAIN? \n\nMike, Will and Jonathan having to flee f-ing government people trying to shoot and kill them.\n\nEleven\/Jane having to go through meeting her abuser again and also having to live through her past traumas.\n\nAnd gosh, I love that Steve, Nancy, Max, Dustin, Lucas, Robin and Eddie had each other but wow.\nThe things they have seen this season is literally otherworldly and not in a good way.\n\nBut the reason I've been meaning to make this post would probably be Max. I know that this season was supposed to be centered around her. Although I am not sure why that is, I am not ungrateful.\n\nI've been on the edge of my seat during the 4th episode. Actually I already knew Kate Bushes' \"Running up that Hill\" before ST and I actually also knew, when and how it was gonna be used in the show. I was still very much blown away and sobbing watching the scene go down. It was so awesomely executed, showing Maxes development and her friendship to everyone else. Again, it's so incredible seeing how much these children grew up. So it was so much more heartbreaking watching hat scene and thinking \"Oh my god, she's gonna die\".\n\nAnd then she didn't.\n\nFast forward to the last episode. I mean, it was so so crystal clear to me, that the plan all of them came up with wouldn't go down so easily and something would happen to disturb everything. But why did it have to happen on Lucases and Maxes end. I mean bad enough that Eddie had to die, but Jesus F. The amount of screams I let out, it was incredible that nobody called the police. \nAnd the way I hate Jason so much for having to interfere with the plan cannot be described. It was almost undeserved for him to die so quickly.\n\nI don't know how to start writing about this one scene. With Max floating up in the sky inside of the house. These images still haunt me. I think Max would be my favourite character and hers and Lucases relationship is probably my favourite relationship of the show.\nSeeing her hanging in the sky and...\nAnd also the way Caleb and Sadie played it so well, with her lying in this arms. It felt so unnervingly and depressingly unreal, I felt so empty watching this scene. I was sitting there in the fetal position and really wondering \"Did that really just happen?\"\n\nI still can't believe the writers went that direction with Max, but I also like that they decided to not have this season end with a \"Happy End\" again. I'm saying that, because it always felt like from season 1-3 it always seemed like they were able to destroy the big evil with little to no consequences. Don't get me wrong, there have been consequences, but they didn't seem that severe, compared to what we got in season 4.\n\nOne big reason why I am making this post, is because I want to process through my emotions, another reason why I'm making this post is, because I would like to hear your thoughts. As I said, I only \"finished\" ST a month ago, so I'm pretty late to the party.\n\nHow did the Internet look after the season 4 finally?\nWhat do you guys think about Max and her scenes in the finally?\nwhat do you guys think about season 4?\nIs there anything I need to catch up in order to even more enjoy ST?","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678134643.0},{"title":"Do you think the parents will behave differently with the events of S4?","author":"HistoricalJunket4848","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/11kcsnc\/do_you_think_the_parents_will_behave_differently\/","text":"I know it's boring at this point to say \"where are the parents\" but after the town hall and cops were questioning the kid about Eddie, it really did seem especially glaring. Honestly, the scene where the cops are questioning Dustin\/Lucas\/Max\/Erica at the Wheelers while their parents (minus Max's) panic while did require a little suspension of disbelief, even in the 80s that seems like a sit-in-silence-while-your-parents-glare-threateningly-at-you situation, rather than letting them have unsupervised conversations in the kitchen and eventually easily escape.\n\nBut the first time I watched the final conflict in S4, honestly I was expecting one of the parents to interrupt in a bumbling kind of way or the cops to be the ones to surprise the \"teams\" during the final conflict, as Jason ended up doing. But I presume they were out looking and just unsuccessful? Unless they'd been told that the cops would track them down and to sit tight.\n\nGiven the \"earthquake\" that happened, the cops probably wouldn't have time to care about them hindering an investigation like that. I don't know about straight-up punishment either, Dustin's mom doesn't seem like the type and hopefully Lucas' parents would realize he'd been through a lot of trauma with several of his teammates dying and his girlfriend nearly so.\n\nBut I always thought it was a realistic touch in S2 that Mike's parents were penalizing him for having a bad attitude because they truly had no idea what he was going through. I could see something similar in S5 where the parents are more explicit barriers to the plot instead of ignorant and laughably easy to escape\/lie to.

I'm all for the direction the show has gone in terms of depicting the struggles of young homosexual men and women in the '80s. However, I find all the forced romantic overtones in some of the edits to sort of cheapen the already beautiful friend dynamic between Will and Mike. \n\nThe two have been best friends since they were little kids. There is love there, but it's of the platonic, brotherly, familiar kind on Mike's end. It seems like some folks don't understand that teenage (probably especially hetero) BOYS tend to suck at being great boyfriends. But Mike DOES have very pure, romantic love feelings for El; he just struggles with vulnerability, probably because he was bullied and an outsider. Will struggles with the same thing, in his own way, for many of the same reasons. And that's what's beautiful about their friendship. They can have these little misunderstandings, but their bond remains strong, and they always work it out.\n\nIt's normal for love to sometimes go unrequited, and for friendships to become strained due to physical distance and\/or alienation due to one's sexuality. It's sad, but it's also realistic. Why can't people just enjoy their friendship for what it is?  A lot of these analyses are really reaching. For example, why does two friends smiling at each other, happy and relieved in each other's presence after tension from a fight,  have to equate \"flirting?\" Are these analyses supposed to be \"fun\" or do you really believe what you're saying?

Once they're in the lab, they find gas and a lighter (because a lab would have that, doesn't make sense but when has ST made sense) They take the lighter and gas along with the recorder things and record their voice calling out Henry in repeat. They take the gas and put it everywhere on the floor, crack the door and leave a toy a few feet away from the door before taking the gas down the hall and hide from Henry. \n\nHenry walks down the hall as he gets to the room and opens the door, he trips on the toy and falls to the floor covering himself in gasoline before he stands up again right when whoever is there lights the gasoline at the end of the hall as it starts to travel towards him. They call out his name as he turns around right before the fire travels to him and starts to immerse him in the fire. As he screams and falls to his knees, the person walks towards him and takes out a final gun and points it to his head. They say something badass probably and then shoot him before the screen goes completely black.\n\nIt goes back to the Wheeler house before the words \"November 6th, 1983, Hawkins, Indiana,\" & \"Wheeler House.\" It flashes to the inside of the house with all of the boys playing DND, pretty much the same as the start of the show. All of them go outside on their bikes as they say goodbye to Mike before biking away. It follows Will as he bikes past the exact spot where he drives his bike off the road, but instead of him running it off, he just keeps going and never goes missing. That's when the final end credits roll and that's it.\n\nExplanation\/summary: Because they killed Henry before he made Eleven snap and create Vecna, which would've never created the Upside Down or the Demogorgon. Meaning Will would've never been kidnapped to start the show, so the kids go on and live their normal lives with Eleven being snapped like that. But, if they were to do a spin off but have the kids as adults in 10 years or so, they could have Eleven break out as an adult or something like that, and the rest of them figure out that they had an entire childhood together and all of that shit.","upvote_ratio":0.29,"created_utc":1678051587.0},{"title":"What random characters from other properties would you like to see Steve interact with?","author":"Realshow","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/7ur7k8cc7kla1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677864620.0},{"title":"I'm a huge fan of the show and turned it into a game :)","author":"GradientGamesIndie","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/o6yrpyqsmjla1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677857862.0},{"title":"Is this why Steve said he specifically wanted SIX nuggets?","author":"OtherwiseCode8134","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/0q1sg0zdqmla1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677877206.0},{"title":"Best scenes is the next game!

And why does he just let it go? To what extent did he retroactively put the pieces together in S3?**\n\nWhen we're first introduced to Billy, he clearly knows nothing and nothing is happening. Maybe he knows about the \"Zombie Boy\" story but he doesn't really strike me as a local gossip kind of guy. Then Max starts running around with the others. He tries to run the boys over and strongly dislike her hanging out with Lucas specifically, but it doesn't seem like he thinks anything is off, just being controlling\/racist\/taking out his own rage on Max.\n\nIn the S2 finale, he goes house to house to retrieve her, presumably just thinking she had snuck out. While it was common for parents to not know exactly where their kids are, after multiple hours, even he seems a little surprised that it's this hard to track them down and comments on it, like \"gee seems like no one actually knows.\"\n\nHe finally gets to the Byers empty house very late at night. Where he finds no parents and no actual member of the Byers family present, but Steve Harrington who lives in a whole different part of town is looking him in the eye saying he's never heard of his sister. Billy knows Max would have other reasons to hide from him so his insinuation that Steve is up to something sketchy with Max is uncalled for, but the whole situation is so odd that I can't blame him for pushing in.\n\nHe attacks Steve\/Lucas and screams at Max for disobeying him, before finds himself being attacked by a literal child and then on the floor being tranq'd by his own sister while she tells him to leave her and her friends alone. IIRC they leave in his car and leave him at the Byers'?\n\nWhat did he tell their parents when he eventually came back empty-handed? And more importantly what did he walk away thinking had just happened? Why was Steve there? Where tf did Max get that syringe? What were they doing with his car?\n\nI know she said to leave her and her friends alone, but he has to know something is off right? But it doesn't seem like he ever pursues it. He never follows up with Steve or rats Max out or pushes any of the characters for information, there's not even a hint that he's snooping or quietly paying attention. Unless I'm missing something, him choosing to ignore all of that, in my opinion, sort of undermines the POV that Billy's treatment of Max comes from genuine protectiveness very poorly expressed, because from an \"overprotective big brother\" POV this feels like the type of situation where following up is actually reasonable.\n\nThere's a little moment in the epilogue where he walks by Max getting ready and says nothing to her, but that doesn't really answer where his head is at on everything that happened.\n\n\\_\n\nThen we get into S3, which is 8 months later, so presumably that's 8 months of him mostly leaving Max alone but aware she's still friends with Mike\/Lucas\/Dustin. Maybe aware she's dating Lucas too, I don't recall? Then he's attacked. From that point on he's partially under control of the mind-flayer but not completely. Does he connect what's happening to him to the incident last year? There's really no explicit reason to, but then also is the unflayed part of his brain going wait how did these kids realize something was off so quickly? And why tf did they decide to lock me in a sauna? His (seemingly genuine) apology to Max seems more about general remorse for what \"the giant shadow\" has made him do, saying it's not his fault, and begging her to believe him. Almost like he thinks she's just a civilian who is doing this as reciprocal violence, rather than as a calculated action from someone who knows more than he does.\n\nAnd at some point he knows via the mindflayer that these kids as a whole are the enemy, but especially El. Will was more sharing a brain, but Billy seems like he's more of a messenger, so did the mindflayer \"brief\" him to some extent? He mostly seems focused on El.\n\nI remember watching the mall finale scene for the first time and initially just thinking that Billy had taken the engine cables just to be an asshole rather than realizing it was due to the mindflayer. But it was right? Or do we think that some of Billy's aggression and interference during the second half of S3 is as much Billy as it is the mindflayer? I think part of the reason his sacrifice didn't really land with me personally is because it wasn't clear on whether it came from a place of actually understanding what was happening and what he was sacrificing.\n\n**TL;DR: What did Billy think happened that night at the Byers house in the S2 finale?

Let's first review what he went through:\n\n- Before the events of the show he was already suffering from poverty and abuse at the hands of his dad. Then his dad left and he needed to step up as a caretaker for his brother when he was a kid himself. All that in addition to being bullied at school\n- Then the one person who he feels a genuine bond to goes missing and assholes pick on him even more for it. Police is mostly useless. When they do \"find\" him he's a floating corpse in the lake\n- Then it turns out that he *is* alive but also there's a dimension with horrifying monsters and they started to enter theirs \n- His family is happy again but not for long because his brother starts experiencing extreme agony and his nice new step father gets fucking eaten\n- Then he's adjusting to life yet again when the rug is pulled from under his feet and he has to move to the other side of the country for safety because another one of his father figures disappeared. And he's not finding himself there at all. He seems like a shell of his former self. \n\nIt's pretty evident that he's suffering from depression. His past is traumatic, his future is uncertain while his present is uneventful. The dullness is a dangerous thing for Jonathan because the first time away from being in constant danger is when the depression has time to set in.\n\nJonathan himself feels like he's sidelined in his own story. He is not the main character anymore. His relationship is falling apart, but he feels helpless and doesn't even feel like fighting for it. He wants to disappear. As spectators we hate it because we know this is not him. We hope his drive comes back in the next season.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677694611.0},{"title":"I wonder who'd win in a fight","author":"Cannabis_Chilihead","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/71yj7tzmg4la1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677656004.0},{"title":"My theory","author":"Royal-Hat7862","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/11g5qjh\/my_theory\/","text":"We all know that in Season 2 Will had \"Now memories\".

Argyle is finishing up the day with one last tasty pie delivery and it's a party sized order, so he might just get an invite on top of a fat tip. Surfer Boys Pizzas are guaranteed delivered hot to your door, but Argyle will need to chill out first if he wants to make a good impression.  \n\nHe's got a decent shot though, since these dudes went for his recommended pinapple topping, so maybe they just need to try before they deny him entry into their digs.  It's going to be a bumpy ride, but you'll get there in thirty minute or less. So hold onto your butts, brochachos. \n\nChapter Two : Be My Guest\n\nWhen I get to the door, I start to think I might have messed up the address on account of it's dead quiet inside. So if this is the party house, it is super chill. But I can't really make out anything in front of me with the stack of pizza boxes I'm hauling, which goes just over the top of my head and down to the tips of my hair around my stomach.\n\nBut then I remember this late night show on the community access channel, that was some exercise thing where the instructor was leading a group into doing some bendy move with their hips and neck. I think it was called yoda or something like that.\n\nIt definitely wasn't like that dance workout thing. You know the one in which they dress up in leotards and sweat bands. Like from that music video with that blonde chick from Xanadu. Anyway, that is not important. It's that bendy move they were doing.\n\nAnd so I give yoda a go and not only am I able to loosen up my back, but I can read the house number on the side of the door, 4819. Which matches what I wrote down on my left arm. Now I just gotta hope I got the street right. Since my hands are full, I knock on the door using my foot.\n\nBut I shouldn't have bothered because the door just eases on open. Now I know what you're thinking, my dude. Do not step inside. So I do what any sane person would do in that situation. I freeze and wait for someone to tell me off or warn me that they'll attack me for breaking into their house. Which is a total accident, if they care to listen.\n\n\"I figured you forgot something.\" Is not the response I was expecting, but I think I know what this dude is getting at and so I holler back. \"Do not fret, my dude. The rest of your order is in the van. I'll just drop these down here and get your other tasty pies, so you can keep the party going.\"\n\nI step inside far enough to set the stack down to a side and when I look up I make eye contact with two of the most beady looking eyes I have ever seen. But as I take the rest of this dude in, I get a good read of his vibe, which is a non threatening loner. So basically he's like me.\n\nI must have been completely wrong about the party, unless everyone else is upstairs or outside, but this dude doesn't look like he's entertaining anybody or that he's entertained himself for that matter. He takes a few steps towards me from what must be the living room and I reckon he must be confused about how I got in. \"The door was already open, my dude. I just gave it a nudge.\"\n\n\"Shit. It does that if it's not locked. I must have forgotten...\" The dude rambles and then he changes direction, \"I didn't order any pizza.\" Oh, now it's my turn to curse. \"Shit! This is the wrong house.\" And I stare at my arm with the address written down, not that I think it will do me any good.\n\nThe dude comes over though and checks it. \"You have the right address.\" Okay, so I'm not crazy and I tell him, \"Well, the dude on the phone didn't sound like you. Hold on, brochacho. I'm not like helping you rob this place right now?\" And he shakes like a ghost. \"No. I live here. What name did this dude give you?\" And I answer. \"Just, Byers.\" And he answers, \"I'm Jonathan Byers.\" And I answer, \"Cool. It's nice to meet you, Jonathan. I'm Argyle.\" And he answers, \"Cool.

But even with these new characters I personally felt like it was such a bad way to bloat this already full roster of interesting characters, which leads to the character Officer Powell. \n\nFor most of season 1-3, was the Lenny (The Simpsons) to Hopper's Homer, since for the most part he was just the non-suspecting cop to from what he thinks is nothing out of the ordinary, but now that hopper is gone and he's promoted to chief. It felt sorta crappy how they never did nothing about it, since there could've been a lot of potential for the story, since he could've been the small town chief who after the events of the mall and now the Munson murders, he would've began to know that whatever is happening, is something that isn't from this world. Ill try to explain what his story could've been in the next paragraph:\n\nImagine this, Chief Powell is now promoted to Chief of police after hopper is presumed dead in the mall fire, for him and the rest of the people of Hawkins its another tragedy that has occurred ever since the disapearence of Will Byers in 1983. And now a few months before the anniversary of the mall fire, another tragedy hits the small town of Hawkins. Chrissy the local cheerleader of Hawkins high is found dead in Eddie Munsons trailer house that morning, as far as anyone knows it was a murder, but for Powell this is something else, he calls the local pathologist about the body, and tells him whatever he saw is not something normal. Most of the bones seemed as if there broken from the inside, jaw cracked with her eyes gauged out, whatever happened didn't occur within normal means, something, and he might sound crazy, something supernatural had to be behind this. Although many believe that the Munson boy could be a devil worshipper or has the powers of satan, he remembers to the time Murray bauman the local crazy talked about a \"Russian girl with telekinetic abilities\", and then he remembers that Hopper seemed really surprised when the kid who pissed his pants when a girl with the same description \"Forced him to piss himself\". He then remembers about the local power plant HNL shutting down around 1984, the same year she was \"seen\", and with the state he found Chrissy in, he knew he went down into a rabbit hole. he begins to investigate more on hopper going into his old cabin which seemed like something out of a Rambo flick, he ends up finding a bunch of boxes under his cabin until he finds \"MK ULTRA\", where he finds out about a local woman working in Hawkins Lab, accusing them of stealing her child, he then tries phoning Murray to get any info on this \"Russian girl\" but to no avail. But as he investigates more on this \"telekinetic girl\" he gets two more murder cases on his hands which makes him believe more that whoever this girl is, is using the state of the bodies her calling cards of sorts. Maybe even mocking the people of Hawkins. But as he's now in the home of the wheelers after finding them near Patricks crime scene, he notices something. these kids where the same ones who sheltered a girl in there basement, the same time as the \"Russian girl\", he then questions them about this having to do with a girl who was theorized to have any powers to could lead to a state such as the victims, which the teens say yes but its not her....its something worse...much worse...\n\n(Sorry if this just sounds like a really cringe fanfic but the fact that Powell could've had a realization that maybe Hawkins isn't as simple as it is, could've been a really cool way of branching out how many of the residents could see Hawkins in general, since almost 3 years of people going missing while agents are asking questions and such would lead to many suspicions.)","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677478257.0},{"title":"Guess who?

Hopefully at the end of the month we could at least get something to happen.\n\n6\/29\/84\n\nProgress has happened. But not progress to get us anywhere. The whole \"machine\" experiment was an absolute disaster, the machine managed to turn on and open up a whole in the wall but after a few seconds of breaching it turned off and blew up in a explosion of lighting. Everyone near the thing where dissolved into nothing but flesh, I didn't want to see whatever was left of them scraped into the floors of the experiment room, from what I've heard, the power in the machine was so strong it basically caused them to melt from the inside out as they screamed in agony. Jesus, what the hell are we thinking?, and now instead of having anything done were now a few scientists short, the government is getting anxious, and Comrade Alexei doesn't seem to have anymore moral in this project.\n\n7\/4\/84\n\nEven though I tried reasoning with Comrade Alexei about stopping these experiments at once, alas he explained he didn't want to give up on the project at all or else he'll rot in some gulag in the middle of nowhere, im starting to think that the government is just wanting to get anything no matter how defiant the thing is, all in the hopes to win this useless conflict. we managed to get another team in but instead of scientists we instead used prisoners that the KGB gave us, most where not easy to work with, most acted like it was some sort of game and didn't do what we told them, but after whatever Alexei told them they seemed more eager to listen. We managed to put radios on there suits to tell them orders without having to be present in the same room during the experiment, since many are still cautious after the first experiment..\n\n7\/5\/84\n\nGod....... it got worse.... The experiment went the same just as the first one, but as it turned off it didn't turn into a shower of lighting. Some sort of earthquake occurred all around the area, many of the stone walls began to crack while sounds of screaming went around the rooms, it was as if we opened a door into hell, but just in a snap of a finger it all stopped until a massive boom came from the machine once again, killing the prisoners instantly, except for one.  somehow he managed to survive the whole ordeal, being stuck under a piece of machinery, but as the guards went up to him he was in a state of shock, for now we sent him to the infirmary but my question right now is how he survived. from what we know so far there was no way he wouldn't have gotten hit by the blast, we checked the camera footage and his location would've had him in the same liquid state as the other. Something doesn't add up.\n\n7\/6\/84\n\nAfter the infirmary trip I managed to get a few questions out of the survivor during his stay there, apparently his name is Misha Antanov, oddly enough that was the only thing he knew about himself, I asked him what did he experience during the explosion but he kept insisting that he wasn't even in the room, apparently during the machine's malfunctioning, he closed his eyes from the shock of light and all of a sudden he was in a different place, he described it as this void full of nothing but red, and an old house in the middle. He felt as if whatever was in that house wanted him to see something, a feeling that a boy could have showing his father his new drawing, and after opening the door he found something that even with his eyes close he can still see, he saw teenagers, kids with no eyesocktets and broken bones inside tree looking objects, all of them seeming to be killed by whatever that thing wanted him to see this. And just like that he woke up to see the guards getting him out of the rubble. I tried getting more information out of him but whatever he told me got him in a state of shock, only looking into the wall in a fetal possession and he told me one more thing. \"Don't follow the creature with big hand.\" after that he passed out, a few hours later he was pronounced dead.\n\n7\/12\/84\n\nA colleague of my gave me context on the experiment we we've been trying to replicate lately, he said the experiment conducted in the United States was sort of of a psychokinesis expirmement, they used kids to understand and practice the concept of telekinesis, apparently they had a few moles inside the lab who stole a few documents which is why we know about this, apparently many \"worshipped\" the leader of the operation and called him \"papa\" to make things weirder, apparently one of those kids managed to open a portal to another dimension, some of the agents compared it to hell for the reddish and almost other worldly look it had. But after that there was no more information about it after 1983, most of the documents went from 1980-to late December of 1983. But as the expirment is looking, its a lost cause, we lost too many scientists to replace, Alexei hasn't even left his office these few days, only glimpse I got of him was him smoking a cigarette outside the base as he stared off to the distance. I guess he's accepting his fate.\n\n7\/14\/84\n\nToday we caught some news, I wouldn't say good but neither bad, Alexei got his up early into the break room to have a scientist meeting, apparently he had some good news that the project would be located to an area more closer to where we can find success, in the Americas, the reason I wouldn't call this good news is because of the following, in order for the KGB to smuggle us into the United States, we cannot tell anyone about this, not even or loved ones, and since we cannot be seen anywhere IE shopping areas, restaurants etc, we will need to stay in a bunker where we can have a food and bed to be in, while we conduct experiments, doing anything to sabotage or to talk about this experiment will to treason and arrest, so its basically a do as we say or go to prison situation. The whole thing to me was complete bullshit, do they expect us to out of nowhere disappear for god knows how long so we can plan an already doomed expirement, none of the things we are doing aren't close to the things the Americans have been doing, but at the same time im not comfortable with having kids as lab rats.\n\n7\/17\/84\n\nI told Alexei I won't do it. Where risking way too much in order to get inside to the United States, what if we get caught or the Americans aren't as dumb as we think? we could lead to an event that could start World War 3 as we know it, and its something I won't want to be a part of. But Alexei didn't seem bothered at all, he only told me that \"if prison is what you want go for it, we can do the project without you, but where not going to die in a gulag because you didn't want to come.\" I told him the whole project was a deathtrap, just because where going to be located in the United States doesn't mean its going to increase our chances of anything, where playing god with something we don't even understand. So I packed my things to get out of here before Alexei tells one of the Lieutenants about my whereabouts, I took some of the documents we had on the project in order to show the abuse and neglect the government has on our scientists, leading to them to die in order to win the Americans, what a petty war.\n\n9\/30\/84 \n\nRussian winter is coming and im already out of options. I removed all the phone cables around my apartment and put paper over my walls in order for nobody to know im here, im planning to hitchhike until I can find a radio station or anywhere I can share my documents to. I know the KGB is trying to find me and im not going to die for nothing.\n\nPart 2 coming soon","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1677431279.0},{"title":"Am I the only one that feels like Vecna is similar to Freddie Krueger?","author":"faizaanmalik","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/11c91xc\/am_i_the_only_one_that_feels_like_vecna_is\/","text":"Well I think it\u2019s because they both kill people in their mind, well technically Freddie kills them in their dreams but it still counts or how they both got burned (idk I think vecna was burned by eleven when she sent him to the Upside Down) but they do have differences, like how Freddie can be in the real world and vecna lives in the Upside Down, that\u2019s a difference, what do you think?","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1677399566.0},{"title":"Steve Harrington are you kidding me\ud83d\ude0d","author":"WweFanKimdOm9","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/74yrvq5uehka1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677376951.0},{"title":"S04E01 - recap only playing on Netflix?","author":"fompas11","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/11cg6gq\/s04e01_recap_only_playing_on_netflix\/","text":"Is anyone else only getting the recap when playing \u201cThe Hellfire Club\u201d?

I have loved all 4 seasons and cannot wait for Season 5. Here are just some of my thoughts on the finale considering how many I actually have.\n\nReally liked Joyce and Hopper's scene near the opening and kiss, though considering what he said his diet has been I wonder how that kiss tasted.\n\nNot a huge fan of Steve revisiting the little nuggets conversation. It was just cringy and to me Steve telling Nancy she's always been there in the fantasy to me doesn't jive with his characterization in other seasons. Thank you Robin for ending that.\n\nThe scene with Jonathan and Will where Jonathan reassures him and essentially tells him he knows was so well done. Jonathan once again shows he can still have great scenes.\n\nWhen Jason showed up in the attic, I was just so sad, I thought he's going to ruin everything. Also I acknowledged just how insane the actual story would have sounded to someone not in it.\n\nFor a quick comedic moment when Steve, Nancy and Robin were entering the house in the Upside Down and avoiding the vines, all I could think was I'd definitely have lost my balance and fallen on all of them.\n\n\"I piggybacked from a pizza dough freezer.\" I had to pause at how funny that sounded.\n\nEvery exchange between El and Vecna was so gripping. Also really did like seeing Vecna share how he shaped the Upside-Down in the years before El opened the gate in Season 1.\n\nDidn't love Mike's speech to El, similar to Steve to Nancy earlier the \"love at first sight\" didn't jive with early characterization and sounded more like something made up to inspire El than how Mike actually feels. There was a mutual crush early on but not love at least to me.\n\nHow long were Steve, Nancy and Robin being strangled by the vines?\n\nThe part where Vecna was getting burned and shot was so epic as they were playing that back with Hopper fighting the last Demogorgon.\n\nEddie's death scene was predictably heartbreaking, hats off to Gaten and Joseph.\n\nJason's death has me split no pun intended. was an anti-villain who I thought was very well-written and certainly deserved punishment, just not sure if it was death that he deserved.\n\nAbsolutely loved the part where the road trip crew pulled up.\n\nAll I could think of the scene with Jonathan and Nancy outside of the cabin, was \"Be Honest Jonathan.\"\n\nLoved Hopper's reunions with El and Mike.\n\nThat was such a great cliffhanger especially when the theme music started to playing.

A surfer boy by occupation of the gnarliest and fastest growing pizza chain this side of California. And I\u2019m not gonna lie to you, my dude. I\u2019m livin the dream.\n\nI got my Surfer Boy Pizza van, that\u2019s all mine to use whenever I want. When I\u2019m not baking pies, I\u2019m driving till sunset, dipping and diving through the rolling hills of my hometown, super sweet Lenora. And I meet all kinds of gnarly dudes, my dude. It\u2019s really the best job a brochacho could hope for. \n\nOh and I almost forgot about the uniform. On top of getting to wear this gnarly shirt and visor, I get to dress it up with all my latest threads. Surfer Boy style. No shitty knock offs, my dude. Only the good threads. But I digress. What was I saying? Oh, yeah. I\u2019m living the delivery boys dream.\n\nThis van is like my second home. I got it all decked out in carpet in the back, with some cushions to chill out on. And I got all my cassette tapes in here, so I can be bouncing to reggae and ska all day long. I\u2019m telling you, my dude. This thing is like good vibes on four wheels.\n\nThere\u2019s also the juicy smell of pizza, mostly pineapple pizza, which I always recommend to my customers and they always go for it because I say \u201ctry before you deny\u201d. And it\u2019s true. Once you try it, you won\u2019t be able to deny it. Which reminds me, I\u2019m all out of Pineapple Crush to drink. \n\nMan, I\u2019m pretty thirsty now that I\u2019m thinking about it. Well I\u2019m almost at this delivery, so maybe they\u2019d be cool with giving me a cool beverage. But on second thoughts, I haven\u2019t been to this house before and even if the dude I spoke to sounded chill on the phone, they ordered a ton of pies for a party. So their buddies are probably starving, which means I\u2019ll just have time to drop the pies and split. \n\nBut on third thoughts, maybe they\u2019d invite me into their party and I\u2019d be down because I'm not only a chill dude that rolls with the flow, but I\u2019m also at the end of my shift so I\u2019m totally free to hang. Who knows, maybe it\u2019ll go down something like this song, with the food and music bringing us together.\n\nHow weird would it be if they were listening and dancing to this right now? Like the spirit of Jah is really leading us on. I feel that. This could be the start of something, my dude. I don\u2019t know what exactly, but it\u2019s like you get this tingly feeling in your throat or like around your stomach or both. \n\nLike right now, I feel something in my throat. But maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m still thirty. Oh crap, the house is coming up on this corner! Wait a second, what\u2019s this water pistol doing on my dashboard? I don\u2019t remember putting it there. Whatever, maybe it\u2019s a sign of good luck and I\u2019ll take a few hits of it before I go in to quench my thirst and my nerves too, I reckon.\n\nThis house is in a pretty chill neighborhood and a cul-de-sac. I love a good chill cul-de-sac. Well here goes nothing, my dude. It\u2019s time for your buddy Argyle to do what he does best.

It was mature and engaging enough for older audiences and fans of highly adult franchises like \"game of thrones\" while still being watchable and surprisingly appealing for many younger viewers\n2. It had younger characters at the center of the story, which is fairly lacking even in family media\n3. It combined the main story and the action very well with heavy emphasis on character arcs and emotional drama.\n4. It cared more about story flow and writing, 3 dimensional characters rather than cheap violence and s\\*x.\n\nThen came season 3.....and things have gone a bit off the rails. I still love the show very very much and think it has retained much of what made the first two seasons so specials, but I feel like it's straying more and more from it's roots when it comes to tone and overall goal. Every season has to have such a busy, intense, visually explosive plot and inevitably at the expense at more then just a couple of the character's arcs and overall cohesion. It's giving more of the clich\u00e9s you'd expect to see, like the writers think this is what will please us, from over monologuing villains to random unnecessary gore.\n\nI hope season 5 can return to it's roots a bit.

Despite her parents' best wishes for her to sleep that night, she stirred out of bed. Holly snuck out of her room and made her way downstairs, finding it empty. That was to be expected, though. A shiver escaped her lips- had it always been so cold? \n\nHolly's eyes scanned the downstairs area, noting several peculiarities, one of which explaining the near subzero temperate of the place; the front door was kicked in, several bolts that held the hinges together dispersed across the floor. At the foot was a dark splat of blood. A chill ran down the young girl's spine, though this did not seem to discourage her from stepping outside. The night sky was filled with dozens of helicopters, all headed inward towards the town square. Glancing around the suburb, Holly noticed that there were fewer cars parked, like everyone had gotten up and left. \n\nCars littered the streets, left on, yet completely abandoned by their owners for whatever reason. The purr of their engines left an unsettling sickness in the pit of Holly's stomach. She considered knocking on a neighbour's door for help, but something inside Holly told her that it would be in vane. Everyone was gone from their places. Holly, dressed only in her night clothing, began to back up into her home. \n\nThat's when she heard it.. \n\nA snarl sounded from the direction of her home, causing Holly to jump backwards and yelp, coming eye-to-eye with a thing unlike anything she had ever seen. The dog-like creature was long and lanky, its skin shiny, reflecting the moon. Then, it opened its mouth, revealing what must have been at least ten rows of pointed teeth, a piercing shriek immediately following this action. Holly was defenseless against the monster, jumping to the side as it lunged at her, falling to the coarse concrete road below. The thing didn't let up, digging its claws into the ground as it reared up for another attack. \n\nThen, a gunshot rung out, followed by two others in quick concession with one another. Blood oozed from the thing's sides, several bullets having punctured its flesh, coming out the other side. A figure emerged from the shadows, clutching what must have been a metal bar of sorts, and they brought it down on the monster's head, bludgeoning it over and over until its head resembled that of road kill. They stepped back, throwing the bent bar of metal to the ground carelessly with an audible 'clank.' Though it was now covered in blood, the face that Holly made out was one she knew. \n\n\"Mike!\" Holly exclaimed, practically leaping into her older brother's arms. \n\nThe boy breathed in, clearly relieved to have found her. \"Jesus, Holly. Thank God you're alright,\" Mike said as another figure approached- Nancy, of course. \n\n\"Are you okay?\" Nancy asked, kneeling down beside Holly, her eyes momentarily falling on the dog's carcass. \"You shouldn't have seen that.\" \n\n\"What is it?\" Holly asked, her fingers interlaced with each other, a nervous habit of hers. \n\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Mike said. \"Nancy, we need to get out of here now- get the car,\" he commanded, and Nancy reluctantly followed his orders. \"We're going on a road trip, alright?\" \n\nHolly might have been a child, but her premature mind was by no means daft- she could tell something was wrong. Still, she went along with it, nodding. A station waggon pulled up on the sidewalk, driven by Nancy. \n\n\"Come on, in the back,\" Mike instructed, climbing into the front seat. \"Hit it,\" he said hastily once Holly had entered. \n\nThe car sped off down the street, passing by more bodies, some a lot more human than monster. Several cars were blocking roads, some even upturned on residential homes. \n\n\"Where the hell are they?\" Mike questioned, scanning the road for any sign of more of those monsters. \"There was a fuck ton back at the library.\" \n\n\"That's where they all are- the library- town square,\" Nancy said. \"That's where the gates all converged, and where most people are.\" \n\nMike shook his head, taking in a shaky breath. \"And we need to go right through it to get out,\" he said, the car now picking up speed. \"Don't pick up anyone. We need to focus on ourselves, Nancy.\" \n\nReluctantly, Nancy shook her head in agreement, turning onto a road that led right to the epicentre of it all. Now that they were in the proximity of the town square, the violence became more and more frequent. A plagues worth of bodies littered the streets, their bodies bloody messes. Some of the monsters were feeding on them, others tackling fresh meat to the ground. They just passed by- they probably could have helped. \n\n\"Where are the others?\" Mike asked as the car doged and weaved around hordes of the restless creatures. \n\n\"They're meeting us on the outskirts- near Benny's old place,\" Nancy said, eyes fixed on the road. \"Jonathan offered to go with Steve to find Dustin and Lucas, Hopper and Joyce, the same.\" \n\nMike's eyes squinted. \"Will and El?\" he questioned, and Nancy only managed a saddened shrug. \"Fuck..\" Mike cursed, drumming his fingers on the side door anxiously. \"We should've-\" \n\n\"Shit!\" Nancy suddenly cursed as a horde of the monsters emerged from a large ravine in the ground, bounding towards the car. \n\nNancy swirved out of the way, the car doubling over on its side, crashing into a building just shy of the rift. All were uninjured, but they had no time to flounder- more of the things were advancing on them, and quickly. Mike took initiative, kicking the passenger side door in vigilantly, no doubt fracturing his toe in the process. \n\n\"Move!\" Mike commanded, leaving Nancy to help Holly out of the car. \"Quick, through Melvalds,\" he said hastily, ducking into the now abandoned shop, the glass panes already smashed in. \n\nBoth siblings wasted no time in pushing the closest shelf in front of the door, hoping to buy them precious time. Mike scooped up Holly in his arms, he and Nancy sprinting through the baron shop, passing buy another body. \n\n\"Holly, close your eyes,\" Mike said, and the girl did so almost immediately. \"Don't stop until I say so,\" he said, leading the run. \"In there: that's the back alley exit.\" \n\nThe three made it just in time for the horde to overcome their crude attempt at a barricade, and the twisted things were quick to make ground on them. There was no time to throw the door shut- there was no real point, anyway. Without a car, they were sitting ducks, no better off than the poor souls they had passed by not even ten minutes ago. Using what they had at their disposal, they darted through the maze that was the backstreets of downtown, losing most of the horde. \n\nAll but one. \n\n\"It might be best to just shoot it at this point!\" Nancy exclaimed through shaky breaths, paranoia rising in her as the thing grew closer each second. \n\n\"Are you fucking crazy? It won't do shit but make it more mad!\" Mike yelled, not once looking back at the thing. \n\n\"Not if we have something hot!\" Nancy shot back, turning to Mike. \"If we get ahold of something flammable, we could scare it away from us!\" \n\nMike glanced around the alley, attempting to locate anything that would aid in this, but everything was passing by so quickly that he couldn't discern a box from a power circuit. Then, he had an idea. \n\n\"Holly, you can open your eyes now, just look at me, okay?\" Mike instructed, Holly following. \"Here, take this,\" he said, handing the trembling girl a small pocket knife Murray of all people gave him. \n\n\"Mike, what the hell are you doing?\" Nancy questioned, the creature growing closer to them by the minute. \n\n\"Nancy, just shut up and grab anything- a large stick- a metal pole,\" Mike yelled off-handed, turning his attention back towards Holly. \"Take the knife and cut around my arm here,\" he said, managing to gesture to just below his elbow. \"Be careful, and make sure to catch the bit you've cut off.\" \n\nNot quite understanding why, Holly hesitated for a moment, though immediately took to cutting upon accidentally glancing up at the encroaching monster. She cut hastily and messily, managing to accidentally skim Mike's skin a few times. Then, she was done. Quick as ever, Holly caught the blue piece of fabric that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. \n\n\"Nancy, take it!\" Mike yelled at his sister, some sort of slim wooden plank in her hands. \n\nHolly outstretched her arm, handing to girl the tattered piece of cloth, to which she wrapped it around the plank. Nancy looked puzzled still. \n\n\"Great, now we just need something flammable to light it with!\" Nancy said, her eyes noticing a sign hanging off of one of the buildings. \"There- it's a store Steve, Tommy and Carol used to steal alcohol from.\" \n\nThe three split off into the alleyway entrance, managing to slam the door shut behind them; that what stall it for upmost of a few seconds. Nancy rummaged through the shelves, yanking away a bottle of alcohol that had the portrait of a man on its front. She popped the cap and doused the cloth in it, pulling out a lighter from her pocket that she always kept handy, trying to flick it on... \n\n'Flick, flick, flick...' \n\n\"Of course. Come on, you piece of shit!\" Nancy cursed frustratingly as a loud clang followed by something metallic toppling to the ground echoed through the shop. \n\nOn all fours, one of those creatures from earlier stared forwards at them, tilting its head before letting out a fierce screech, causing Holly to flinch; the others weren't as scared. They'd done this before- the routine was getting tedious. Nancy continued to fidget with the lighter, the thing staggering towards them. \n\nMike pushed Holly out of the way, screaming louder than he ever had before, \"run!\" \n\nHer little knees buckling from sheer fear, it was a wonder that Holly was able to do that, retreating from her siblings into an adjacent aisle. She soon crumbled to the floor, her legs having given up. So, Holly led there on the grimey floor, stock still with her eyes closed so tight that they hurt from it. Holly thought that, maybe, she would be left alone. A struggle could be heard on the other side of the set of shelves, followed by two painful sounding slams, but the hunt wasn't over. \n\nNothing else ensued, all that filled the silence being snarling and clamping that seemed to be getting closer. It was just all of her senses being enhanced because her eyes were closed- surely, that was it. She'd managed to convince herself that naive thought was true, even as a limber figure approached her. It stalked towards her slowly, sniffing the air. It was almost like the thing was trying to determine if Holly was really dead or not. \n\nDenial wasn't a good look on the young girl, especially considering she herself did not believe her own lie anymore; the warm waft of somethings breath caused doubt in her mind. Slowly, Holly opened her eyes, only to be met with a sea of dancing teeth, saliva dripping from them and landing on her face. She suppressed the urge to scream. It lurched its back, its teeth ready to clamp down on her- \n\nA screech. \n\nThe thing had screamed so loud it made Holly's eardrums pop, but she was alive, at least. Mike stood between Holly and the creature, blazing torch raised at it. He had managed to do it! He swung it around like it were a set of nunchucks, pushing the thing back as it snarled in disdain. It fully backed up, cowering back into the alleyway where it came from. \n\nThere was a silence, but it didn't last very long. One of those dogs suddenly busted through the window, tackling Holly to the ground again, managing to sink its teeth into her stomach. \n\nMike's world seem to stop. His own sister. Blood on her- on the floor. He dropped his guard for a moment. No, they weren't through yet. \n\nA round of gunshot fire rang out, and the dog's limp body tumbled to the ground beside Holly's spasming one. The shooter was Nancy, gun raised. She and Mike crouched down beside their wounded younger sister, looking distraught. \n\n\"We need to get her out. Now,\" Nancy said, and Mike agreed, hoisting her body upwards. \"To a safe area- we'll jack someone's car if we need to!\" \n\n\"Hopper and Joyce, they'll know how to help us!\" Mike said, bounding towards the door, Holly in hands. \"But we have to get there quickly, she's losing a lot of blood!\" \n\nTogether, Nancy and Mike sprinted through the chaotic mess that was downtown Hawkins, passing by many building that were on fire. A minute and no car- five- now ten! There was nothing- no working cars anywhere. Though Nancy was still looking around frantically for a car, Mike had realised what she was too scared to even notice. Holly wasn't breathing anymore. \n\n\"Nancy, shut the fuck up!\" Mike exclaimed, managing to hold Holly's cold body with one arm as he grabbed ahold of Nancy's,\u00a0 dragging her away from the main streets into a small clearing; they had been searching for long enough to breach a part of the forest. \"Holly, she's-\" \n\n\"She's not!\" Nancy exclaimed as Mike lowered Holly to the ground. \"Don't finish that sentence, you mother fucker!\" \n\nMike was on his knees attempting to resuscitate his sister, having felt no pulse in her wrist. \"She doesn't have a pulse- she isn't breathing!\" \n\n\"So you're giving up on your sister that easily, Mike?\" Nancy exclaimed, pushing him aside. \"If it were Will-\" \n\nMike snapped, \"don't you bring Will into this- he has nothing to do with it-\" \n\nNancy had suddenly stopped dead, her glossy eyes emitting tears. They streaked down her rosy cheeks just as slow as the realisation hit her. \n\nHolly was gone.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677035452.0},{"title":"Lesson learned: do not try and get with the Wheelers","author":"Gullible-Condition91","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/117lh4m","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676929415.0},{"title":"Why does it have to end?","author":"Acceptable_West_1349","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/1197845\/why_does_it_have_to_end\/","text":"All this talk of it ending after 5 seasons.

Compare this to how she feels about people who do treat her equally, i.e Dustin whom she has a deep respect for (\"Know him? I've bled with him\"). Because of this, I think Erica would make a great lawyer. She's smart, she's not afraid to holding her own (she took down a jock twice her size), she has a surprising amount of judicial knowledge (\"child endangerment\" \"minor misdemeanor\" \ud83d\ude2d) and I could totally see her representing people who have been undermined and discriminated against by those in power.\n\nWill -\n\nWill's best quality is his empathy, because despite being the center of everyone's concern for the first half of the show, most of he's always shows more concern for others than he does about himself, like how he was more worried about Jonathan's hand being cut when he was the one in the hospital bed, how he was there to console El when she was having a bad time at school and how he was there to console Mike as well reguardless of how complicated his feelings were towards him. \n\nI honestly can see Will working in the animation industry, probably as a director, story-board artist or writer because he already has the art skills plus I can see him see him seeing the 80's anime Akira when he's in college or something and being inspired to go down that route. And because of his empathy and how he views other people, if he were to be writing characters for his projects he'd probebly be writing them with lot's of dimensions and layers. I see him being someone like Dean Deblois, who was also a comic book nerd from a small town who went on to work on movies like Mulan and Lilo and Stich before writing and directing the How To Train Your Dragon movies (he's also gay \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08). \n\nDustin -\n\nDustin's best quality is his logic and how most of the time he's always the level headed one in the group, which we see in season one where he tries to resolve the argument between Mike and Lucas, in season 4, when Lucas tells him that the jocks are after him he doesn't freakout because he knows Vecna is a bigger threat or the many times he's helped the group solve difficult problems. \n\nI think Dustin would probably be in the robotics and engineering field as an adult since he's already quite skilled at building advanced pieces of technology,  and probebly becoming a YouTuber as well, kinda like that guy Mark Rober where designs and makes crazy pieces of tech for his videos. \n\nLucas -\n\nLucas is my favorite character and what I like most about his character is was his determination and how much he cares about those around him reguardless of what the situation is, like in season 1 where reguardless of how his friends felt he was going to go and find Will, even if he was going to go on his own, in season 2 where he continuously tried and eventually won over Max, in season 3 where he saved everyone's asses multiple times and in season 4 where he was always trying to help Max with her situation eventhough she kept him on trying to push him away. \n\nI can totally see Lucas becoming a detective for the FBI as an adult. A job like that requires you to be both intelligent and athletic, which Lucas is and I think his determination would take him a long way in that field.

I heard that the Duffers have said that this movie was a big influence on coming up with Stranger Things, and one of the reasons why they wanted it to be a show and not a movie was to differentiate it from Super 8. It has a monster, it's set in the past, and there's a group of friends trying to figure out what's going on in their small town. If you haven't seen it yet, I think it's definitely worth watching.\n\nFor the Eddie and Chrissy fans, I would recommend the 1988 remake of The Blob. The heroine is a cheerleader that teams up with the town outcast.\n\nThere are two novels by Grady Hendrix that I would recommend to Stranger Things fans that are a little older due to some of the scenes: My Best Friend's Exorcism and We Sold Our Souls. My Best Friend's Exorcism is set in the 80s and friendship is the major theme of the book. The main character of We Sold Our Souls is a guitarist who was in a metal band.

There are dark clouds with red lightning, plumes of smoke, spores falling, and vegetation decaying. The Duffer Brothers were not only inspired by film and literature, but video games as well. One game in particular that inspired the layout of the Upside Down is *Silent Hill*. The town of Silent Hill is covered by a dense fog, has no sunlight, and contains monsters. The wiki states (of the town), that \u201celements of the unconscious mind, including impossible monsters and scenarios, can manifest into tangibility.\u201d Furthermore, according to the same article, \u201cThere is no distinct boundary between the Real World and the Fog World. The flow of time and the laws of physics can also change when entering this state.\u201d\n\nHenry\/Vecna has shown incredible power and that he can influence the perception of others, making them experience auditory and visual hallucinations. My theory is this: Hawkins is doomed to become a town like Silent Hill. Already, the town is mingling with the Upside Down. And I think the government's cover story will likely be that the town is irradiated, being deemed \u201cunsafe\u201d for humans (kind of like Cherynobyl). We also know that the Upside Down is toxic to humans, so there is a possibility of the cover story not being a complete lie. The Upside Down could actually be radioactive evidenced by when Hopper first discovered the Mothergate, he kept coughing from breathing in the spores. The scientists also confirmed the air is toxic in the Upside Down. And in season 2, there\u2019s a scene in the second episode of a technician replacing a battery of some sort beyond the Mothergate and Owens asks \u201cHow\u2019s it looking out there, cowboy?\u201d and he responds with \u201cUh, you know, Doc. The usual. Nice and nasty with a chance of **radioactivity**.\u201d\n\nOf course this is just my insane crackpot theory. There are a lot of people speculating that time travel will play a major role in Season 5 so maybe Eleven or Henry could return Hawkins to a previous state (pre-merging with the Upside Down). But I honestly think Hawkins is doomed and will fall entirely, slipping into obscurity and urban legend.

High School is still hell for Eddie \u201cThe Freak\u201d Munson, but he\u2019s itching to burn straight through the start of Fall Semester by setting right off on his insane D&D campaign. Though to make that happen he\u2019ll need his band of metalheads, some lost sheepies and Black Sabbath. Will this session be a critical success? Find out in this one shot story about Eddie and The Hellfire Club.\n\nChapter Two : Out Or Inn\n\nI hear the sheeps' scattered footsteps as they enter the school theatre and stop as they reach the drawn curtains of the stage.They told me at lunch that they\u2019re experienced players. Advanced. But they also admitted that they hadn\u2019t played together for some time. A fact that they might regret sharing. Regardless, this will be a brand new education for them. One that begins with the sound of metal.\n\nI hit play on my cassette tape deck and Black Sabbath\u2019s 1970 debut album ushers the sheep forth through the curtains to where we, The Hellfire Club, have gathered. It\u2019s like looking into a fun house mirror, as I see the naive faces of Mike, Lucas and Dustin with their character sheets and dice, while across from them sitting at the grand table in Hellfire Club shirts are their grown up reflections: Gareth, Jeff and Freak, and of course I at the head of the table.\n\nLike the choice of music, my intention is to gently ease the sheep into this new world and not melt their brains. So I beckon them to approach, \u201c*It begins to rain as you weary band of three arrive at The Hide Inn Tavern. After many weeks of traveling in search of a quest to fill your spirit for adventure and your coin purses, you caught a break when a band of misfits invited you to meet and discuss the proposition of joining them in a local mission they were hired for.\u201d*\n\nThe sheep gather to take a seat at the table, but I continue as they have not been properly summoned, \u201c*You find the inside of The Hide Inn, much like its exterior, to be rather ramshackled with various items that do not seem to go together. But somehow it\u2019s held up and the same could be said for the inn\u2019s business, as there are maybe three patrons in all.\u201d*\n\nThe sheep still wait to be seated, *\u201cOr so you thought, because someone whistles to you from a dark corner of the inn where you see a band of four adventures,The Hellfire Club, who called you here and now wave you over to take a seat at their table.\u201d* And at this point I let the sheep know they can sit down and they do so with a sigh, but I can tell that they\u2019re fully into it now.\n\nI then introduce my band seated around me, \u201c*There\u2019s Gareth the Great a human wizard, Jeff the Jackal a nobel thief, Freak the Furious a harp playing bard, and finally the leader of this band of lost souls, Eddie the All-seeing Eye.\u201d*\n\n\u201cCool shirts, by the way.\u201d pipes up the sheep called Dustin. \u201cI, however, unlike my party members, came dressed according to the meetup. The \u201cHide\u201d Inn. Hide. I\u2019m a barbarian.\u201d\n\nEven though it interrupted the flow, I got to give it to Dustin, that was kinda charming. But it\u2019s not going down well with the rest of my band. Like Freak, who blows back, \u201cWe\u2019re a serious outfit, bonehead. So if you want to don the uniform, you have to earn it like the rest of us.\u201d\n\nFreak may have overdone it with the bonehead comment, which in all fairness on the roleplaying side, Dustin\u2019s character probably does have horns on his helmet. But I can see how things could escalate into some hurt feelings, so I try to bring the killer vibes back down.\n\n\u201cWhat Freak the Furious means by that is we have a high standard here. And so before we decide to let you into the club officially, we need to know you can meet that standard. So basically we need to trust that you\u2019ll be up to the task.\u201d\n\nI expect Dustin to answer, but surprisingly it\u2019s Mike who takes to speaking for his herd. \u201cWell actually Dustin was also a bard once, before that character died, if it\u2019s any consolation to Freak the Furious. I\u2019m a paladin and Lucas is a ranger, so all three of us would make up for the fighter portion your club lacks when it comes to battles, along with any other individual special skills we can provide. And so for our portion of the club\u2019s earnings, I think it\u2019s only fair we split it evenly.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help it, I\u2019m impressed, and I might just have pegged Mike wrong as Gareth\u2019s younger reflection. He reminds me more of myself. But I can\u2019t let him know that, as I don\u2019t want to boost anyone\u2019s confidence this early in the game, before it\u2019s really begun.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair. But just to be clear, it\u2019s only the six of you.\u201d I say, \u201cEddie the All-seeing Eye does not go on any of these adventures. He just finds them, sets them up and sends you on your way. So it\u2019s up to you whether you get paid or not. And as far as if your character survives, well we have our own special \u201cHellfire\u201d way of sending you off if you don\u2019t.\u201d I show them my Zippo Lighter. \u201cAnd that\u2019s if you make it through this session. This is just an audition to get into the club.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1676679570.0},{"title":"Which character do you think would secretly have a double life?","author":"Babettesgnomes","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/yyxnb1vx4oia1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676604858.0},{"title":"Don\u2019t know if this is allowed but I\u2019m looking for help for a Stranger Things Fanfiction","author":"RavenNight789","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/114qw0d\/dont_know_if_this_is_allowed_but_im_looking_for\/","text":"\nHey all, I hope everyone is doing well.

Moving the focus away from Hawkins for an episode is, in my opinion, **a great way to build suspense.** We have to wait to find out if Mike and the rest live or die.\n2. **Kali was an interesting and complex character.** This one is obviously pretty subjective: I'm guessing a lot of people thought she was a boring character. But I think it was interesting to see how she was loyal but not open-minded, and how she immediately accepted El as a sister - but on Kali's terms. Also I like how she shows El the butterfly, and says that she can make beautiful illusions as well as frightening ones, but she doesn't realize that the path she has chosen prevents her from making beautiful things.\n3. **It was character development for El.** I think that El deciding to go home and help was much cooler and more realistic than if she'd been there all along. Also, seeing Kali showed us what El might have become if she had met different people and had different experiences when she escaped.\n4. It created precedent for S4. Yes, we never heard of Kali again, but that doesn't mean she didn't influence El. And they show us in The Lost Sister that El isn't vengeful, which provides the clue that El didn't kill everyone in Hawkins Lab. Also Kali is a good contrast to Vecna\/Henry\/001: Kali is vengeful, but Henry wasn't really motivated by revenge, he just wanted to kill.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1676486768.0},{"title":"If there were 100s of demodogs in S2, why didn\u2019t they just invade the Hawkins given they were already capable of doing so?","author":"luvisinking","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/6e3vddonneia1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676471890.0},{"title":"I think Eleven did remember the way he told her about to escape the lab and she used it to do so four years later.","author":"ilovemarvel69","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/1136br6","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676489392.0},{"title":"Episode Duration","author":"Pitiful_Project9837","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/11360hw\/episode_duration\/","text":"I don\u2019t understand why everyone is so annoyed about episodes being too long.

It appears that there are stages of the 'infection' as well-\n\n1- Face hugger implant. (Connects one to the upside down, appears to put undeveloped demospawn in the system)  \n2- Infection. (See aversion to heat, consumption of corrosive chemicals within 24 hours, likely to easily destroy inner systems. This may be redirected by the undeveloped demospawn\/infection to keep muscle systems and brain intact.)  \n3- Rage States\/Spread (increased expressions of anger, abducting other potential parties for the meat-flayer. Those deemed disposible are decomposed upon implantation. All of this is done while otherwise conducting 'normal' behavior.)  \n4- Loss of Control (Infected subject becomes possessed by the meat-flayer\/Vecna to perform its will as necessary, and personality takes a back seat. Subject is no longer in control of their own body, though control may be momentarily returned\/fought for in the short term when necessary)  \n5- Decomposition\/Death (body of the infected falls apart to join the meat flayer, made easier due to the consumption of corrosive chemicals.)\n\nLike, this is all HORRIFYING! First being abducted, implanted, and potentially witnessing others decomposing\/being taken apart to join the meat monster responsible. And then, having to go back, not wanting to\/being able to say anything, having the urge to consume things that are inevitably actively destroying your insides. All of that is no doubt incredibly painful. Then, probably being unable to eat properly for upwards of a week, and then being compelled to harm others\/having bursts of anger that might feel like rabies, all while suddenly being shoved into a mental back seat while your body acts of its own accord, practically falling apart at the seams, all to just suddenly die.\n\nShits so fucked!","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1676250605.0},{"title":"You can only choose one \ud83c\udfb5, what's your musical lifeline ?","author":"kittykitty_katkat","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/wgy9suid5rha1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1676205287.0},{"title":"SEASON 2 SPOILERS I was rewatching when I noticed this about Will","author":"That1RightThere","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StrangerThings\/comments\/110ut3l\/season_2_spoilers_i_was_rewatching_when_i_noticed\/","text":"SPOILERS How did Will get flashes of the Upside Down before being posessed by the Shadow Monster?
