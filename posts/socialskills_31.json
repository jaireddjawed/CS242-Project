I throw in a few jokes and make the other person laugh and I am having somewhat fun but the vibe is not there. And others I have no vibe with. I WANT too have a fantastic vibe with everyone. I want everyone too be super happy when they see me because they know they are up for a good time. How do I accomplish this?\n\nI have no problem with money so my plan is too travel everywhere and just talk with everyone because I  have no fear then because my reputation is not on line. I can do whatever I want with no consequences. Will this work? Is this a good plan? Is this the best thing going forward too become that guy that everyone vibes with and looks forward too hanging with?",

I didn't wanna jump to any conclusions (but I should have) so I waited until my first pay check came in. And I got paid today and lo and behold, I'm getting paid 10.50 an hour. \n\nI wanna ask my boss about it but I'm scared of being embarrassed or coming across as rude because I'm afraid I'm supposed to be making 10.50 an hour and asking why it's not higher will come across as being rude and will embarrass me. I have bad social skills and anxiety lol. \n\nIdeally I'd talk to her in person about it but we work in a VERY small store will all of the scheduled employees crammed into one tiny room, so I wouldn't be able to talk to my boss about it without others overhearing. I want to ask her to call me so we can talk about it over the phone, or just text her about it. I'm just not sure what to say and I'm really scared. Help!",

Few years ago when I was getting married **she offered to borrow me money to buy a house without me ever bringing up this topic**, but I was not thinking of buying a house mainly because the country I was living in the rent is less than half the price of a mortgage payment, it just doesnt make sense to buy a house.\n\nNow I moved to a new country with wife and kid, here the rent is similar to monthly mortgage payments, so I'm seriously thinking of buying a house now. \n\nI have enough money for down payment, but it will be quite a big stretch for me, being new to the country also means I dont have any credit here and maybe very hard to get a mortgage, also why pay the bank interest if I can pay it to my relative instead?\n\nThis relative we still do video chat almost every week, mainly because she loves my kid and she wants to see him often. \n\nSo back to the main question... what is the nicest way to bring up this topic with her? I imagine calling her and \"Hi I want to buy a house can you borrow me money?\" sounds super awful...\n\nI'm an introvert and not good at bringing up topics, especially bad about asking for help, even worse if it involves money...\n\nThanks",

On the one hand, it could deliver a way higher success rate of getting the digits, because it's doesn't indicate that I want something from HER, but, on the other hand, I'm much more exposed to be flaked and ghosted later on, because it barely shows my romantic interest towards her from the very beginning, which certainly isn't the case with \"my traditional\" methods.\n\nWhat are you experiences with these two approaches?",

If you're already a person who knows how to have fun, hold decent conversations, or you have a pretty cool life to share with people-- then this advice might actually be good for you.\n\nThe problem is if you currently don't know how to have engaging conversations with people, you don't know how to deepen connections, how to find relatability with people in a fun way-- then chances are the \"you\" that you currently are isn't the kind of person you want to be.\n\nDon't be limited by what you tell yourself you are. Because I want you to think about it… what is this \"yourself\" that everyone speaks of? How do you know if you're being yourself or not?\n\nMost people might say that you're \"yourself\" when you feel natural and at ease. But here's the thing: if you want to transform yourself into a person who is more social or a better conversationalist… someone who is engaging, fun, and can make friends and deepen connections; then you might have to do some things that don't feel comfortable or put you at ease (at least the current version of you).\n\nBut this is the same as someone learning to play the piano-- at first it will be uncomfortable and frustrating-- but the more you practice, the more smooth it will become.\n\n***Don't be yourself.***\n\nStart being the future you that you want to be instead. In time, it will become the new \"you.\" That's how change happens!\n\nYou probably can visualize the type of person you'd like to be. If you need some tips on how to get there, let me know what your biggest struggle is (or message me if it's personal to you) and I'll see if I can help. If not, I'm sure someone here will be able to give you some good advice as well.\n\nOkay, I'm off to go play some Mozart on the piano. Have a great week everyone!",

That was because I had to slowly build-up my social skills. Back then I couldn't even say hello to a customer at work. I would overthink something so simple. But over time as I started asking how people were and as I started having smalltalk with coworkers I started to slowly improve. After that I became much more confident in my ability to talk to other people and in turn became more confident asking out that girl.\n\nShe told me that she had a boyfriend although she did seem flattered. And I think she legitimately had a boyfriend too not the \"I have a boyfriend excuse because I don't want to tell you no\" kind of reason. And truth be told I kinda already suspected she would have a boyfriend. But there was a certain point where it wasn't about her anymore. I wanted to prove to myself that I would be able to get out of my comfort zone and I did.\n\nAfter I asked her out my hands were shaking.\n\nThis was actually the 1st time that I asked a girl out ever.\n\nAny questions?",

If you want GOOD friends, then you both should be actually nice to each other or you might not last or they’ll backstab. But good friends can be difficult to get, so if you just want people to hang around and good-enough friends, just look and act charming. There is a reason why total douchebags still have friends. People should stop lying to their children that looks don’t matter either, their affect socially is night and day, especially for women.

        "text": "I work part-time at a supermarket in Fresh Produce. \n\nA few months back, a co-worker of mine named Nick confided in me that he was interested in this girl on the night fill team (her name is Jess). After what he suspected was lots of reciprocal interest on her end... He took Jess out to a restaurant. \n\nThe next time I saw Nick he looked miserable. He told me how Jess seemed completely uninterested throughout the evening and didn't ask him anything. He wanted to do it again another night (but she said no and never again). \n\nHe was pretty torn up about it... Especially because she began spreading rumors to work colleagues that Nick is super lame &amp; boring &amp; weird.\n\nAnd as the months went on we began to discover that she had gotten a guy who worked alongside her in night fill fired. I've heard conflicting stories about this, but some say the guy touched her derrière. While others say they were an item (with a lot of emotional bickering). Either way, she got him fired. \n\nChristmas then came around shortly after, and with it, a Christmas work party. Both Nick and I did not go to this party. But it got back to both of us that Jess was sitting on a middle-aged manager's lap and things escalated between the two of them. \n\nA few weeks later, we heard from some trusted sources that Jess now had chlamydia. The point in mentioning this isn't to shame her. But when collating all of these data points together it doesn't look great... \n\nAll of this is to say though that I was experiencing all of this vicariously through second-hand stories as I had never personally met the girl (as she worked nights). So it never really affected me despite being aware of her. \n\nThat is until the last two weeks or so... \n\nJess has now started working day hours (like me). She works in the click-and-collect online department which gathers items from around the store for customers to then conveniently pick up. And will find any and every excuse she can to interact with me (and I already inherently do not trust her). We do not work together and yet she will come up to me and act like she knows me. Which I personally find very unsettling...\n\nI walked out the back a few days ago to take the trash out and she was with her little coterie of lady friends (none of whom I know personally or on a first-name basis). But as I passed by, she immediately began trying to joke with me and use my name as if she knew me. I didn't want to give her or her friends the impression that we were tight so I just answered her question and left. \n\nToday, she's been buzzing around my general vicinity (and Nick has noticed). So as Nick and I were chatting, Jess then shouted out to me from across the bakery area. And when I looked over to her she was grinning and wanting to tell me that a customer came up to her to ask for my name. I looked at her slightly confused not knowing the point in her telling me this (we're not friends). And she elaborates, *''Oh, it's a good thing!! She said you have amazing customer service.''*\n\nBut this story comes off as low-key BS to me. Because, I wear a name badge, so if the woman in question really wanted to know my name she'd have either glanced at my name badge (or simply asked me for my name while I allegedly served her). Not ask some random girl at my workplace who doesn't even know me. And secondly, I've been in a bad mood all day due to extenuating circumstances outside of work. So I've not been nice or polite to any customers. I've actually been short &amp; unenthusiastic. \n\nPoint being: I can smell some BS going on. And Nick has noticed it too. \n\nFor the record, I haven't been encouraging her. But I'm not sure what I can do shy of telling her to f-cuk off?... Which would be overkill considering all she is guilty of towards me is an over use of friendliness. \n\nBut this girl seems like a minefield. And when she declined to see Nick again I straight-up told him it sounds like he dodged a bullet. So I have no idea how I'm meant to avoid this girl without setting her off and getting my ass fired.",

        "text": "Hey!\n\nI've come a long way in my \"social skills\" journey. I was a very shy, easily embarrassed teenager who could barely make a phone call. For about five years, my only friends were on the internet and lived in different countries. I would sometimes eat in the bathroom at school so nobody saw me eating alone. I would even use other people's pictures to represent myself online because I was so self-conscious and wanted to be someone else (I don't advise this). When I typed something out on a forum, I would re-read it at least 5 times before hitting enter. I would end up sounding so pedantic that even when I posted anonymously, people could tell it was me from the style they could only describe as \"try-hard.\" It sucked. It was so damn hard, like bashing my head against the wall over and over again.\n\nA lot has changed. It's roughly ten years later. I have more friends now than I can sometimes keep up with during the day. Sometimes I make phone calls on other people's behalf because they're too shy to do it. I have a several very social jobs: working with people who have mental illness, children in foster care, and with homeless people addicted to drugs. These jobs rely on my ability to have safe, supportive, nonjudgmental conversations and to built rapport quickly with people who are already slow to trust. I speak assertively and I have real confidence that's still improving.\n\nAnd I'm proud of this. It's such an accomplishment to me because I've spent the first 25 years of my life feeling so \"less than\" socially. I'm coming on here for a few reasons: to tell my story, to share what I've learned and help people, to show you what's possible, and to learn more.\n\nHere are 10 thing that helped me most. There are way more and it took time. It wasn't one thing alone but the one factor everyone needs is just the desire to get better at social skills. If you have that, you'll forge your own path. Here we go:\n\n1. A book about interpreting body language called \"What Every Body is Saying\" by ex-FBI agent Joe Navarro (I have no personal investment in promoting this book) I read it 3 years ago and I still apply the concepts every day.\n2. Joining some groups where the focus was on the activity, which I was already interested in. It made socializing a lot easier. Taking on a leadership role and helping teach others. Builds competence, which leads to confidence.\n3. Dropping all assumptions that I was a social fuck-up and thus interrupting the recurring pattern. Making it not about \"me\" but \"what I'm doing\" gave me the control to make changes to what I was doing.\n4. Not making excuses for other people when they treated me wrong. Not taking the blame when it was rightfully theirs. Having self-respect garners the respect of others. Stop chasing people who are not interested and believe all red flags.\n5. Express emotions more openly. I used to get called a robot or even non-human, which is disgusting. Opening up was hard for me as a man. I did it in small ways, to start, with people I reasonably thought I could trust. Being vulnerable draws people to you. Even if you're just starting with verbalizing the feelings and not displaying them, that's still a start.\n6. Dropping the idea of perfection. Imperfections draw people in as well. Admitting when you're wrong is honorable. Having weird quirks is usually seen as endearing or even cool.\n7. Don't argue or yell back in an argument when you're being disrespected.\n8. Attribute the emotion to the correct source: \"am I really mad about the person who merged in front of me or am I taking it out on them because my dad yelled at me?\" for example. Another example would be, \"do I really feel anxious or am I choosing to feel someone else's anxiety with them to make them feel comfortable?\"\n9. Don't try to honor other people by sharing in their negative emotions. If you really care about lifting others up, feeling bad for/with them won't help. You can acknowledge their pain, yes. That's important. \"I hear you\" or \"omg that's terrible!\" but always come back to a place of stability to help from. \"Put your own o2 mask on before helping others\".\n10. Listen to your gut. As in, \"Am I shaking before I hit *Send*? Do I have that familiar feeling that I get before fucking something up? Maybe this is my social intuition telling me to wait until a better time.\" You might not know why something is wrong but your body still knows it's wrong. Trust that feeling.\n\nObligatory \"I'm not an expert.\" Just a guy who thinks he can help someone along his own journey. Take the advice that works for you and discard all the rest! Not everyone needs to hear the same thing right now. Open to any questions and respectful comments. Have a great day/night!\n\n**EDIT:** ♥️ I see and appreciate you all even if I didn't comment or thank you individually. It all means a lot to know that my younger years served in some way to help you. Love love love!\n\n**EDIT to add** [**another tip**](http://web.archive.org/web/20220720154443/https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/jl9jci/if_you_want_to_increase_your_social_status_in_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

She knows how much I like him and how much I struggle trying to even text him.\n\nI like this friend but I think she doesn’t really think about stuff like this, or is indifferent to it. Because there’s another friend of hers who experience the same time thing as me, but it’s to a greater degree because that friend is already sort of together with the guy, but this friend is still chatting with the guy like best friends.\n\nI think part of it comes from the insecurity that they have this shared interest and so they would communicate with each other, but I just think it’s an unwritten rule not to text your friends crush especially if it’s unnecessary.

        "text": "I used to get sad and upset over feeling like I'm always the most unimportant friend in a friend group. My friends would often just not invite me, forget about me and not check up on me when I was going through a hard time. I used to feel lonely sometimes even when I was hanging out with them in right in that moment because I felt like a background character. It always felt like they were closer to each other than to me....because they were.\n\nEventually I came to the realisation that except for one or two friends from that group, most of them were not actual close friends. I would never hang out with them one on one. We never had any meaningful conversations. Sure, we hung out a lot but we weren't actually close, in the end we weren't more than just close acquaintances or the type of friends that come and go during a period of your life. I had no reason to get upset that I couldn't depend on them when I was struggling because we just didn't have a close enough relationship for that.\n\nThe reason that they would often do activities without me was because they had their own individual strong bonds within our group. The kind of connection you just cannot build in a larger group setting and that grows between two individual people.\n\nI realized that all this time I more or less just had the illusion that I had many close friends just because I was part of a friend group. To build strong lasting friendships I had to stop relying on the entire \"group\" and actually put in the effort to text my friends individually instead of in the group chat and asking them to do stuff with me individually.\n\nI'm not saying that there's anything wrong with relying on your group of friends. But for me the reason why I always felt excluded and lacking of true close friends was that I was expecting all of this from a group of people when I was not actually close with them individually.",

Especially since you're not watching the show with them, so why do they feel the need to criticize your taste in tv shows?\n\nOr like they're serving you food and they're like \"dont take too much everyone wants some\" even though 1) there is literally a fuck ton of food, so even if you took a heaping portion, there would still be enough and 2) as far as you're aware you do not tend to hog food?? So where is this coming from?? And 3) they singled YOU out to say this to specifically, did not address the group\n\nThese have both happened to me, and both times I felt paralyzing embarassment. The way i responded to the first one about the TV show was \"that didn't seem necassary to say\" and the to the food one i was just like \"do i typically take more than my share??\" I think i masked my feelings of embarassment well, as I used a calm, even tone, and didn't react intensely, or display strong emotion, which at least is good.\n\nBut either way, the comments keep coming and the passive aggressive jokes haven't stopped. I do not want to cause a huge conflict with this person, but I feel like they are picking on me and I don't know how to get the target off my back.\n\nAny ideas on how to deflect the negative attention off of me with social grace?\n\nEDIT: thank you for all the advice everyone. The next rude comment came that evening, and I tried the Agree and Double Down. The other people in the room laughed, they didn't, and continued and it escalated to where they seemed to be talking down to me in a condescending manner. So then I just tried agreeing with them, that also didn't seem to work. I honestly think my next method is just going to be avoid and ignore them. But the good news is, that everyone else in the room also seemed uncomfortable with how they were talking to me so I know it's not just me being \"too sensitive\".",

Other members of our group were similarly appalled and shocked that these people could behave in such a manner.\n\nI called both the men out on their actions and warned them of cutting them off if they didn't wise up. Of course, they both had their excuses (being drunk) and insisted that their side of the story be heard. I hate confrontation, but this was too important to avoid. It has ruined the previous group dynamic, which is fine, and is reshaping the atmosphere when we all hang out in a very positive manner.\n\nDon't be afraid to call out unacceptable behaviour, particularly if you are a white male. We have the loudest voice and will be listened to moreso in situations like this than a woman would, unfortunately. This has helped me build great trust with the rest of the group, although I do not want the appreciation of requiring someone to act like a human being.\n\nEdit: thank you for the award, kind person!\n\nI still don't deserve thanks, it hurts that this situation even arose in the first place. It was embarrassing and humiliating, even from a male perspective...\n\nEdit 2: whoa, lots of awards. Thank you all! Now, go! Make this world a little bit better today!",

        "text": "I'm a 37 year old man with ADHD. I've been struggling my entire life to make and retain friends, impress women, and not be a complete train wreck in social settings.\n\nBut instead of sharing my tales of woe, I am simply going to jump right into the remedy:\n\nInvest time into your appearance.\n\nHere's what happens: people notice you unconsciously. If they like what they see, YOU will feel that unconsciously. You will simply feel better around people, they'll like you more, and you'll be extended more grace in social settings.\n\nWhat you want is low-cost passive advantages. You want an avalanche of those advantages, so that practice becomes a natural by-product of your existence.\n\nThis is my daily bathroom routine:\n\n* floss\n* brush with whitening toothpaste\n* rinse with whitening mouthwash\n* wash face deeply\n* moisturize\n\nIt takes around 10 minutes. I try to do it twice but I never do it less than once per day.\n\nIf I'm going out, I consider who I might see or who I might want to interact with. I think about how they'll be dressed. I try to style myself to look like the guys that will be there but with enough attention to detail that I'll stand out (ie. clothes that fit properly and match).\n\nFor a haircut, I just ask for something that looks modern and go every 2-3 weeks.\n\nBonus: 100% of the things I listed can be bought or at least you can get free advice.\n\nExample: walk into a decent clothing store and tell them you want a few shirts and a pair of pants that fit. It's literally their job to help you and if you're embarrassed about asking, who fucking cares because they're never going to remember you anyway.\n\nSame for haircut. Just tell them you want something that looks good.\n\nFor hygiene, just go to a skin care store and ask. Once again, give zero fucks because they'll never remember you anyway.",

Now for her, we were talking like we would do every night and she was being flirty a bit with me which I was fine with, saying how we may get together and stuff like that but after everything that went down that I still have little information on what I did, she said that she was only saying these things because she felt bad for me because of things I said people do to me and I'm happy she admitted that but all people that care for me feel bad for me and I don't see how if she did not have any feelings like she did say why say things like that. Like, am I that stupid or unlovable that people have always needed to act to make me feel better I don't want that I know I may be annoying but I'm not as bad as lots of people so I just don't get it. And now she won't even talk to me the only thing she has said to me is she needs time, but what I heard from a friend of hers is she said I'm a snake like I know she has as hard as a life as me but I can't fix something when I'm not told what is wrong. Even with her saying that I still care enough to want to keep her as a friend if I can but so far it's been a week and I have nothing and it hurts \nSo to the person reading this if you have anything you think I should do let me know I don't want to lose her but same time I should be okay, oh and I think this hurts so much for me due to me having no friends and it feels like everyone hates me and these friends I have/had losing them has made me feel like I have some kind of attachment problems \n\nSorry if this is hard to read or understand I'm not good at making things make sense and again, please if you can tell me what you think would be good to do",

My advice, be confident that you're an amazing person, dont be shy to initiate first interaction and proposing activities. Always respect yourself and demand respect by others even if you really wanna be friend with them. This might be my personal trauma speaking but never force it, after a certain time if they like you and want to kick it with you they should show it and ask you. If not keep some distance.

I don't get why, it's not the people who used to in middle school it's people who only know me for who I am today.

        "text": "So like the title says, I’ve been having some trouble with engaging in conversation with my friends and their other friends. Just last week I was meeting with a friend(let’s call her G) I hadn’t seen in about a month and we were gonna hang out at an event my university was having. To my knowledge it was gonna be me, G, our other friend(let’s call her S) and G’s roommate. For context, me, G and S are in the same friend group and have been friends since we were 15. We are 19 now. We aren’t super close but I wanted to become closer to them. G and S are also besties and have been since 6th grade. Back to the story. I was fine with that because although I didn’t know the roommate I knew both G and S since we’re in the same friend group and it wouldn’t be so awkward. Fast forward to the event, we all met and it was ok but I was having trouble participating in the conversations they were having because they kept speaking about things I didn’t know about. While we were waiting in line for an event to start(for about 10 min), I didn’t say one word because I couldn’t figure out how to insert myself. I felt super awkward and embarrassed because they just kept talking and I felt really left out. We ended up going to get something to eat and all of a sudden more of G and S’s friends show up to join us. I’m talking like 4-5 more people appeared. At this point I was feeling very annoyed and uncomfortable because to my knowledge it was supposed to be just us 4. I didn’t have a problem with the friends that showed up because we all went to the same high school together but I just wasn’t friends with them. We sat down for dinner and everyone was talking to each other and I was the only silent one. I didn’t know what to say and I was so embarrassed that I wanted to cry. I ended up making up a stupid excuse that I had work soon so I could leave. I’m very socially awkward/anxious so it’s hard for me to genuinely make connections with other people. Literally all the friends I have now are friends I made in middle/high school. I was much more confident and carefree back then. I was really looking forward to catching up with my friends and this really discouraged me. To make matters worse I felt really jealous about the fact that G’s roommate is closer to my friends than I am. She’s even closer to G and S’s friends and I’m not even though I’ve known them much longer. I’m not sure how I could’ve done a better job in that situation. It’s like my mind went blank and no one said anything to me. What could I have said to join in on the convo? I would have loved to be friends with G and S’s friends because they are genuinely cool people but we just don’t hang out unless G and S are around. I hate feeling like the odd one out.",

And I don't even know how I made friends then (I actually have memory loss from that time). I'm an introvert really, but I do desire friendship and company. I don't like crouds or large groups, but I do enjoy one on one interactions. But, as an adult, I don't know how to make friends of such. I mean, how do I ask someone to hang out without sounding like I'm asking them out? I just want the two of us to hang out. That's it. But it just feels like it sounds like I'm asking someone out. Also, I don't enjoy being in town much. My enjoyment is at the park, or hiking the trails, or out fishing, or something similar. But if I ask some if just they want to come join me strolling around the park, it sure, in my head, sounds like I'm asking them out.\n\nReally, I'm looking for a friend I can share my thoughts with. And groups are not enjoyable to me. I like one on one interaction. But it feels weird to ask someone to just hang out like that...\n\nAny tips, suggestions, thoughts? Thank you!",

When I say \"older\" I mean at least late twenties and beyond. I'm 18. I don't mind casual conversations at all, and I have older guy acquaintances in my hobby classes, but like I said, I also seem to have interactions that I think are just plain strange. \n\nThere was a middle-aged man at a public garden area that waited for me at the entrance and began to talk to me. It wasn't long before I realized he was saying completely nonsensical things despite looking pretty sober and normal. I noped out of there pretty quickly. Someone hanging out at a gas station eyed me as I walked in, then complimented me and asked for my name in a way that sent chills down my spine (it's hard to convey in text, so I hope I don't sound paranoid or something).\n\nJust recently, I had what was probably the strangest interaction. My mother had called in at a local construction company to have some fencing put in, and they arrived 2 hours early. I had just pulled into my driveway when I saw them park on the side of the street. I called my mom and confirmed that she had planned to meet them there and I told them what she wanted put in. One of the men, making casual conversation while the other guys were working I guess, told me that he sees me at our local grocery store (he mentioned this on two separate occasions), that he liked my car, and gave me a fist bump for some reason, all in a very short time span. It's not unlikely that he'd see me at the store since it's close by, but why he would remember me and tell me—a complete stranger—is odd. He now knows where I live, too. \n\nI've considered that I am maybe just being paranoid, or maybe that the strangeness of these interactions has been entirely fabricated by my mind. Even still, I don't know what to do in situations like this. No woman has ever approached me and talked to me, so I don't know if there are other intentions behind it or what.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI posted this yesterday, but I guess I will try again because it got pushed under a lot of posts. \n\nI, [19M], am having trouble making friends in college. I would say that I am the “quiet kid” in class, and I haven’t gotten officially diagnosed with social anxiety (with some perfectionist symptoms), autism, and the like, but I do feel like that I have some symptoms of the given disorders. From an outside perspective, people may think of me as aloof or disconnected or maybe even apathetic. However, if there is a class where it gives me the opportunity to lead a small group or something, I’d be all for it. In complete social situations, like a group conversation, I would be quiet most of the time. I have this common problem where I would think too much about what I was going to say that the conversation drifts onto the next subject. This is mitigated when the conversation is one-on-one and we can go deep. I have problems approaching people first because I worry that I’m going to be awkward and fuck up.\n\nIn college, I tried joining clubs that pique my interest, but so far I only have acquaintances, not friends. Aside from school and clubs, I mostly study in the library or at home, or do my hobbies, which are mostly solitary activities. I have actual good friends since high school, but they are not in the same college as me. I think that is part of the problem. I get so used to my old friend group that I do not know how to make new ones. I still have contact with these friends, but I only speak with them occasionally due to my classes and their classes.\n\nRecently, a girl from a class that I kind of had a crush on approached and asked me to join her study group. I thought she was also showing signs of attraction, but only to my disappointment, she has a boyfriend. FYI: I did not ask anything about her relationships or my interest in her leading up to that. That made me feel even more sad and lonely. We only had 1 study group meeting so far, and I don’t think we would’ve worked anyway because she seemed to be a more sensation seeking person and I am myself. Since then, no messages in the study group chat. I feel like getting know her group more even with my issues, but part of me wants to put up my apathetic face during class and not interact with her. I think if I try to initiate stuff, I will just seem desperate.\n\nWould like advice.\nThank you.",

It's probably obvious but I am rather introverted or maybe I just don't like people much, when I'm with a close friend I'm told I get loud (to the point they have to tell me to be quiet since I'm too loud) and can't stop talking.\n\nI tried googling for conversation starters but they're all things you wouldn't randomly walk up to someone and ask.\n\nAny advice?",

So I have made literally zero friends in my almost two years of college, I'm very socially anxious and haven't made a quality friend in many years. \n\nA person who usually sits in the seat next to me told me \"hey you look pretty cool, we should study for the next test together!\" and handed me a slip of paper with her name and cell number. I've talked to her a tiny bit before but otherwise she is a total stranger. She seems like a cool person too and potential acquaintance but i just don't know what to do now lol....\n\nDon't know what to text her, if we did study it'd probably be at the library or something since i don't know her well, I have no notes and was going to use the powerpoints to study so I have nothing to go over with her. I don't know I'm just like. Very much caught off guard and my social anxiety is screaming NO but i want to be social dammit!!",
