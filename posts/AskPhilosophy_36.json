        "text": "Why is the subjective nature of similarity not considered a fundamental flaw in induction and analogical reasoning?\n\nThe problem with induction, as per Hume, questions whether we have any reason to think that the future resembles the past, and questions whether we can justify a prediction about unobserved things based on previously observed things. \n\nBut before even making an inductive reference, along with using analogical reasoning, one must first decide what to include in the data. But I fail to see how this can be defined objectively. For example, if one were to make the inductive reference “The sun rose yesterday and the previous 100 days. The sun will rise tomorrow”, you are implicitly assuming that the event of the sun rising each day are in some way the same or similar to each other. \n\nBut the notion of similarity, when pinned down, sees to be subjective. It’s context dependent and arguably not mind independent. Every event in the world is different. Similarity is usually based on objects sharing properties, but it begs the question of which properties to look at. In the case of the sun rising, it might seem intuitively more obviously that those events are the same or similar every day, but in other cases, it is not so obvious. \n\nFor example, say I observe 100 men and notice that all of them have a pet dog. I now come across another man. I make the inductive reference that he probably has also has a pet dog. But why am I making this inductive reference? Because he’s a man. \n\nBut a man is just a shorthand term that represents the fact that different people have shared properties. What if, for example, those 100 men were all below 100 kg. And the next man observed was 105. Why should he be taken to be similar enough to the 100 men to allow for an inductive inference to be taken in the first place? \n\nOne can argue that this property is not relevant, which then begs the question of what is and isn’t relevant in terms of inductive reference. \n\nIn essence, the idea of what makes objects similar is murky territory. And this idea is needed before an inductive reference or analogical reasoning even gets off the ground. I feel as if this problem is even deeper than and sort of precedes the problem of induction.",

My first question is whether there's any meaning to life, my second question is that if there is no meaning then what's the point of living? Why should you live at all if your made-up objectives don't bring you anything other than momentary happiness?

My teacher said Aristotle would most likely say no, since man is a social animal and needs interaction with the external world to exercise virtue.\n\nTo me it seems like the tension between the internal and external is irreconcilable, since one one hand, virtue isn’t something that can just be observed, but on the other, it requires the virtuous person to act in a virtuous way.",

An anonymous audience has proposed an intriguing question; we are glued to the screen as it demonstrates the question: Do you believe in time? This is a blase question in the physic field. However, there is more advanced intelligence that is steering our human species. My hypothesis is relatively simple. We live in a three-dimensional space because our living space is ostensibly the geometrical space, so we could never fathom the intelligence who can live in a four-dimensional space. Time as the fourth dimension, is something we humans can never control. We only know it's a measurement we use to calculate the length of time. However, the intelligence living in the fourth dimension can live through the time dimension and travel back and forth through time. The theory is simple, for example. The crab only crawls sideways, so he lives in a two-dimensional world and can never go forward. I think this principle also applies to time.",

        "text": "I'm somebody interested in philosophy that has not studied it in depth. I learned about Albert Camus maybe two years ago and have been \"checking out\" his philosophy of the Absurd (by \"checking out\", I mean very slowly learning about it through secondhand interpreters rather than reading him directly. So there's a high probability of misinterpretation or misunderstanding.)\n\nFrom what I understand, Camus agrees with the idea that there is an intrinsic human need for meaning, and there is no satisfactory source of it in the universe. To him, this tension leaves us with the three options: suicide (which he says resolves nothing), arbitrary belief systems (a.k.a. a \"leap of faith\", like religions, somebody else's set of morals, etc.) or revolt in the face of meaninglessness (which he argues for.)\n\nThis has never truly made sense to me. I think my biggest question is, how does this resolve anything? Revolt sounds at best like a distraction from the issue at hand. I understand that this revolt must come with a full acceptance of life's meaninglessness, and then to continue living in spite of it, but shouldn't that option be just as much \"correct\" as the other two? Under what criteria exactly is revolt better than suicide, or the leap of faith?\n\nThat's my question. To add some loose thoughts: I can affirm to myself every morning when I wake up that nothing matters and then continue to live my life for that day just fine (in fact, this is somewhat how I live). But I don't see how the first action informed or helped the next. If anything, the \"living my life\" part seems like it outright ignores the acknowledgement that nothing matters. I mean, after years of believing nothing matters, I still find the thought utterly terrifying, and I ignore it when going about my day-to-day for that reason. So what exactly is Camus suggesting? How am I supposed to accept meaninglessness WHILE justifying the effort required to do things? I.e. what does it mean to revolt? Am I doing it right? If so, isn't what I'm doing still dishonest, since I go about scared of meaninglessness every day?\n\nAny thoughts at all by people who understand Camus' work better than me are welcome!

A facebook post here, a tweet there. Changing your profile pic to the image of a movement before switching it back, or a hashtag SaveTheTurtles. It's not that these are bad things to do, it's that it feels largely like a pat on the back to make people feel like they're helping rather than doing something that is actually going to have significant positive consequences in the world.\n\nBottom line is, it seems people will do anything to promote justice as long as they don't have to give up anything of actual value to themselves.\n\nI'm looking to read some philosophical work discussing call to arms, so to speak. Something discussing the moral obligation to act in a manner that actually has utilitarian, real-world consequences, and more specifically how personal sacrifice plays a role in this. I have already read Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill, which is good, but I think I'm looking for something thats less about theory and more about applied ethics. By no means does it have to be a work of formal philosophy, even just something with philosophical undertones would be good.",

People on this social media are definitely in a state of what Marxists call Alienation. I believe this can be seen by anyone who uses this social media. The point is, people on this social media are extremely fake, they have to fake their extreme level of friendliness, they have to fake their level of energy, optimism, and their level of gratitude for anything and anyone related to the post, and also those \"inspirational quotes\". I sincerely believe, Linkedin, as a significant part of the core of the white-collar world, is another level of alienation that is developed in the current state of Capitalism. If people's lives continue to approach such kind of fakeness, my Materialist part of Marxism says that, that their fakeness will become a \"part of their true self\", and they will believe that this is part of their true self, and praxis like that, even though that they did not achieve their \"true self\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is just my 2 cents, and it could be narrow. So I just wonder, what is the Existentialist's approach to this kind of Social Media?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zuawco/is_it_ethically_wrong_to_buy_an_expensive_car/",
        "text": " \n\nThis dilemma came to me when I saw a famous person - youtuber from my country (post-communist country), who bought an expensive car from his earned money (70k car and he is 18 years old) and was criticized a lot , because he could have donated that money (he donates to charities frequently, but not a lot).\n\nMy perspective on this hypothesis (I may be wrong, as I am still a teenager): 1. It is ethical for each person to spend his money as he wants, as long as he obtained it honestly, not through fraud, exploitation, etc. 2. Already, through taxes, we help poor people a lot, we offer them social assistance, health insurance, etc. 3. It is ok for everyone to donate money, but we should also spend the money on products. For example, if many people would donate money to the poor areas of Africa, modern society would stagnate / or take it down. 4. If we donated a lot of money to Africa, a lot of it would not reach the poor people because of corruption. And if it were enough, those people would not know how to spend it, having a primitive mentality. Therefore, we should also invest in their education. 5. I believe that billionaires have a much greater responsibility than us ordinary people, because they have more money and influence and would bring about a greater change. 6. By buying products, for example, an iPhone, we indirectly help poor people, i.e. factory workers, and at the same time we also help the global economy.\n\nIn conclusion, what do you think about rich people who buy expensive things? Don't donate enough to charitable causes? What are they doing right?  \nWhat do you think about the youtuber from my country, who bought that expensive car?",

But CCTV cameras could do the same?\n\nPersonally, recording calls have been very helpful to me, I am a designer (so needless to say that) my clients do not communicate what they want very well (lol), and I do not speak some local languages which are used where I am living these days. Obviously, it is a lot easy to communicate in a language which you have been speaking since almost always, so my clients have to speak in English with me, and sometimes, they do not communicate very well. So when we are speaking about requirements of a project, recording calls can be very helpful to me as I can listen to it again to understand them better.\n\nSo in general, can call recording be considered ethical or not?",

Such a retort implies a certain level of epistemic authority attached to a mechanical tool (which may be limited to casual circumstances but is undeniable to modern humans).

But I don't know if there are so many differences between the analytical philosophy (appears to me they are actually the same kkkkkkk). Do you think that this diference realy exist and if exist what is the type of philosophy that will conquist the world.",

        "text": "Hi, I'm a university student that wants to change majors to philosophy as I have been recently interested in the complicated concepts about existence and all other sorts of stuff (ethics, aesthetics, free will, etc.), and I've seen that this particular book by Hegel is widely known for being complicated, which for me, all of them are complicated. But to be fair I cant read a book even if it would mean it could save my life as I have attention problems and haven't been able to fix them in order to develop a good reading habit/environment (if you have any tips for managing ADHD with reading it would mean a lot). As such, I have decided to ask ChatGPT, the new advanced AI software that answers all types of questions, to summarize briefly Phenomenology of Spirit. Is the summary accurate to some extent, or is there major information that is missing? (I'm not looking for a complete understanding of the book, just the little gist of it is fine).\n\n \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" is a philosophical work by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, in which he explores the development of human consciousness and the evolution of self-awareness. The book is divided into three main sections: the \"Introduction,\" the \"System of Ethical Life,\" and the \"Absolute Spirit.\"\n\nIn the \"Introduction,\" Hegel discusses the nature of consciousness and the way in which it arises from the interaction between the subject and the object. He argues that consciousness is a dynamic process, in which the subject actively seeks to understand and make sense of the world around it.\n\nThe \"System of Ethical Life\" explores the way in which humans form communities and societies, and the role that moral and ethical values play in shaping these social structures. Hegel argues that these values are not fixed, but rather are constantly evolving as society progresses and changes.\n\nIn the final section, the \"Absolute Spirit,\" Hegel discusses the ultimate realization of human consciousness and the ultimate goal of human development. He argues that the Absolute Spirit is the ultimate unity of all knowledge and understanding, and that it is through the process of self-reflection and self-consciousness that humans can achieve this ultimate unity.\n\nOverall, \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" is a complex and dense work that explores the nature of consciousness and the way in which it evolves and develops over time. It is considered to be one of Hegel's most important philosophical works and has had a significant influence on the development of modern philosophy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo keep in mind that I'm not a native english speaker, so if there are any big grammatical errors I do apologize. Have a good day and thanks for answering.",

We knew the history clearly yet we still repeated it so if that’s the case even if we know the history are we still bound to repeat history In other ways? Does the quote even mean anything when we are sill repeating the same stuff happening even 100 years ago? Or is the human race just bound to a cycle forever repeating until we make ourselves go extinct? istory always repeats?",

I have a month or so off until the start of the next semester in my Master of Finance degree, and was hoping to get through it all during that time before school picks back up.\n\nFor context, I took a few courses of philosophy in undergrad and have read Grayling’s The History of Philosophy, but otherwise am relatively new to formal works.  My wife and I have love to debate though and have listened to Stephen West’s Philosophize This! podcast twice in its entirety, and I’ve really taken an interest in Heidegger from all of that, and so want to tackle his main work.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",
