I got in trouble with her BF because of that and the woman was pissed at me(I was friends with her too before). He lied and I straight up told him that.I unfollowed him from IG I restricted him and I lost all respect I will permanently ghost him. I questioned the whole relationship, he never included me in his plans to hang out, he been giving me bad vibes and my body was warning me about this as I can sense bad vibes from people. I don’t want to blame him for getting me in trouble as I was the one constantly trying to shoot my shot and comfort her, but the fact that he lied to me and obviously never even respected me, that crossed the line and we’re done. I blocked the woman to prevent further trouble and unfollowed the friend. I don’t like being lied to. Did I took it to far to unfriend him because of that? Lesson learned watch out who you friends really are they may not be as friendly as you think. Is there anything I could’ve done differently? I’m currently really upset and sad.",

I tell him that I don't carry cash, but offer to buy him a slice of pizza from a place across the street. He turns down my offer, instead suggesting that I go with him to an ATM. Something clicks in my head, and I recognize this as a red flag. I give my best \"nonchalant no,\" and cross the street to my bus stop. A minute or two later he comes up to me again, and asks if I was sure when I said I couldn't help him. I sort of \"brush him off,\" as casually and politely as one can, and he leaves.\n\nWas this guy trying to rob me? I've been approached many a time before by people asking for cash, but this was the first time I've noticed anything suspicious. I've heard of people getting lured to ATMs and robbed before, Which is what part of me thinks this guy was trying to do. I hate assuming the worst in people, especially those in need, but maybe this guy was trying to take advantage of that.\n\nIf anyone here has been in a similar situation, please let me know what you think.",

I think I have a good heart, I’m just going through a bit of depression and I don’t know who I am. \n\nEither way, I DONT KNOW HOW THE F I managed to pull my amazing boyfriend. \n\nHe lives with his cousin and when I’m with them I’m just awkward. I can’t think of what to say. Sometimes I find myself super quiet even after we are alone again. \n\nI am like this with people too. I feel like I find one person I am comfortable with and then I follow them around like a lost puppy and in big groups I always stick to this one person. I can’t seem to feel confident in big groups. I always think I’m boring or that I don’t belong in big groups. \n\nAnyway, my problem right now though, is that my boyfriend wants me to meet his friends. That is great, that means he is proud of having me. It makes me happy, however, it also makes me anxious and one time I evaded that situation. He actually stopped hanging out with his friends to be with me. He is a sweetheart yes, but I feel so guilty. That was not fair. And his best friend is coming to visit him soon next month and I am also very nervous. I don’t want to be awkward and boring. I want to fit in with them and understand their conversations, and create more conversations. \n\nWhere can I start? I feel like, I’m pushing myself but something’s off. For instance, my bf and his cousin sometimes switch language with me, and I understand that it’s when they want to talk about private stuff, however, sometimes I can’t help but think they are talking about me, or at least his cousin saying stuff about me like asking why I’m nervous or idk. \n\nJust today for example, the house was so quiet and I think it made my boyfriend uncomfortable. He even said \n“It’s driving me crazy”. \n\nI don’t know what to do. It’s a state of mind I can’t seem to evade.",

We never spoke, but he did speak to my friend (I'll call X).\n\nAfter this meeting, K somehow finds out through her mutual friend that X is a 'player' as he's previously slept with other female work colleagues and that she felt uncomfortable with the attention X had given her as one of the women he had slept with was her friend and is ignoring her now (this is relevant).\n\nFast forward a few weeks, I am about to sit with my cohort for lunch when he joins. My friend, K, tells me she'd like to sit separately for lunch today to spend time with me - I think nothing of this and we pick a separate table to sit at. Throughout this lunch, I can feel him staring.\n\nUnfortunately, it just get worse from that point onwards. He stares at me EVERY time I'm in the office - as if he's pissed at me or something. It's very obvious and if I catch him he doesn't look away and keeps staring. To avoid it, I'm currently sitting in a section of the office that blocks his field of view so he can't see me. However, if he leaves the office for whatever reason, he walks past my desk and stares. \n\nAt my Christmas lunch, the entire time, both me and my friend were being stared at. I didn't mention anything but my friend K picked up on it and told me.\n\nThis week I passed him in the corridor and smiled at him, hoping it would end whatever weird hate he has towards me. Instead he gave me a very disgusted look. \n\nI really don't know what to do - I feel like he hates me because I took K away from him on the day he joined us for lunch idk?. I hate conflicts in the workplace but I'm struggling with how to proceed with this. I haven't even spoken to the guy as we are on completely different teams. I feel intimidated and uncomfortable, any advice?",

Then i remembered the Tramadol.  I still feel it this morning.

If so i'm happy to do whatever it takes to be able to go out and socialize and just not be bothered by it, just because all of my friends choose to live that way doesn't mean i have to, And i know how it is unfair because i can't control my friends lifestyles because i don't want to live that way, Any activity i could think of with friends which wouldn't involve either alcohol or weed, they'd still slip one of those in which is fine but it makes it a matter of how do i become unphased by the presence of weed or alcohol? \n\nI know deep down i truly don't care about getting drunk or high anymore and the temptation is nowhere near as strong as it was when i was a teenager but it's still there with me, I don't care if one friend was drinking infront of me but i think i'd feel more left out if everyone but me was drinking and or smoking, but again i don't truly want either anymore but it still bothers me being in their presence.\n\nIts like my brain is telling me \"Look at what they have, that's something you don't have\" it makes me feel awkward, but if i was at the very least working right now and was regularly saving up i would care alot less, it's not that i want/need money to do what my friends are doing but rather an income would make me feel alot less insecure about myself and not drinking or smoking, i have a good few hobbies and interests, some i spend alot more time one than others, but even with those things right now, it doesn't make me feel like i have a good or secure life.

        "text": "(sorry if i make any mistakes, english is not my first language)\n\nI’ve know this girl online for about 3-4 years. We recently had a fight about a guy and she blocked me. The problem i always had with her was that she would just randomly stop talking to me or just start ignoring me, she would always say she was “bad at texting” but she clearly wasn’t. And of course i would always run after her all the time to still be friends, but every time this happens it felt like i had to start all over again, like she didn’t remember my birthday, where i was from, what i liked… it’s like she just used me for a period of time and just threw me away. Another thing that happened was that we had a mutual friend; which since she would just randomly not talk to me; i ended up getting closer to him (never in a romantically way). Out of nowhere she just assumed i liked him and start treating me like trash, assuming i liked him and stuff, never once tried talking to me, she just jumped into conclusion. That mutual friend distanced himself from me and continued talking to her, and of course i stayed alone but eventually tried again ruining after her. A similar thing happened recently, she stopped talking to me (her excuse was she didn’t answer discord messages on her pc, only on her phone) which i thought was weird but i didn’t mind it. I ended up talking more in another server which her ex (they dated fir like a month) was in it and we eventually started talking more. She found out and made a big deal out of it. And that mutual friend i talked about earlier was okay with me talking to him since he did too…but when she found out he took her side. Taking to that ex, i found out i wasn’t the only one of her friends that talked to him but i was the only one that she made a big deal of. I feel like she has a problem with me especially with me but i’m not sure. They were my only friend group so i’m not sure what to do now.",

        "text": "I have (or had) a best friend who I love dearly. We had a sister-like friendship which was generally healthy and good.\n\nWhen she started spending a lot of time with her boyfriend, the three of us started hanging out a lot and became close. They even joked that the spare room in his house was my room. He was very hospitable to me and I told myself I would never take advantage of that. They said a few times that we were like a family.\n\nWe would quite often take some recreational drugs (weed, shrooms, ecstacy). We also began having threesomes. This seemed more or less like healthy sexual exploration.\n\nRecently, they have been busy. They have not been inviting me over as much and when they have, I felt the dynamic had changed. The past few weeks, my friend has sort of only asked me to hang out when her boyfriend's dog needs baby sitting.\n\nI felt hurt. Whether right or wrong, I had convinced myself that they were now using me and the relationship had become transactional.\n\nThis weekend, I was meant to go round to theirs to dog sit. They cancelled yesterday because they weren't going out anymore. I got annoyed and said they can't just drop me when they don't need me. My friend texted saying she didn't mean I couldn't still come over. Then when I asked about what day I should come over, she said actually she had a busy week and wanted it to just be her and her boyfriend.\n\nI did a 180 and flipped. I sent angry voice notes saying they had fucked me around. I told them to give me some shrooms for compensation (as my friend was coming over to pick up her laptop - we are roommates). I thought, well if they are using me, I'm going to use them.\n\nWhen my friend came over, she was furious. She told me that she was just tired and wasn't trying to fuck me around. She said I should be grateful after they had let me into their boyfriend's home and that I was entitled for asking for the shrooms. She then left while I sat there like a lemon.\n\nI feel like the most terrible person in the world. I honestly thought my actions were justified because I was so sure I was being used. I couldn't deal with the changes in the dynamic, I was looking forward to going round his this weekend, and I felt neglected and taken for granted. Now, I realise I channeled these underlying feelings into selfish, catty, childish actions.\n\nIt is not the first time I have fucked up a friendship or seriously hurt someone. I thought I was getting better as a person just yesterday, so now it's like I've relapsed. I'm not sure whether to try put things right, or to count my losses and just be alone for the foreseeable future? Thank you for reading.",

        "text": " \n\nHello everyone. Just a few thoughts about being interesting. Please share your view and thoughts\n\n**Be a passionate person:** when you start a hobby do you expect it to show itself magically to be your vocation or you invest time, energy and get passioned about it? You decide consciously to get passionate about it.\n\n* What if i am an introvert, timid? The people who are naturally more outgoing and extrovert will find it easier to be passionate about something. But here is the secret. Deciding to be passionate will change your nature and form your character.\n\n**Feed your natural curiosity:** as a human species we developed cognition which makes us able to go over apparences and find the true mechanisms that regulate life.\n\n* Curiosity is a muscle. It needs to get trained\n* If i decide to get passionate about something (see above) i stimulate my curiosity and i start to study or train for the activity i chose\n* People will look for someone who shows himself by his passions. If i study to appear someone i am not i may look savant, erudit but also annoying and useless\n* Tip on how to be curious: realize that you are ignorant. When you choose a passion there will always be new things to learn about it\n\n**Find your stile:** i mean this in every aspect of your life whether it be linguistically, aesthetically etc.. show yourself for what you are.\n\n* Take care on how you appear to people. That is the first thing they are gonna notice.\n* Be careful. Appareances are important but not so much that you have to lie about them. If you don’t really know who you are (i will make a post on how to find who you are) you will try to omologate to how socially you think is acceptable but sooner or later you will realize you wasted time because you are not that thing\n* Remember, interesting people will build their style based on their intentions and not on other people expectations\n\n**Keep your word:** there can not be any kind of interest for someone who is unreliable. People get interested in you because they think that under the surface you have something to show.\n\n* An interesting person is someone who is coherent about their language, perceptions and style. Being coherent about what you show and what you are indicates that you respect yourself\n* If i respect the goals i take on, if i respect what i say i will do, people will be interested because what they see matches what you are\n\n**Be interested in other people:** this is the last point but it well may be the first. You have to be interested in what other people say. When in a conversations you have got to be able to ask the right questions. To listen. If your friend is talking about a problem in his life listen and ask more about it. Don’t talk about yourself trying to relate. Try to ask more about the thing is talking about because you wanna know more.\n\n* Listening to other is essential to understand yourself\n* Not interesting is someone who listens only waiting for his turn to talk",

I'm a 16yo girl. I'm HSP (hightly sensitive person) I've had anxiety my hole life, and dealed with severe depression for some years due to trauma (yes, all of this is diagnosed and I go to therapy). I've been out of school for two years for the trauma of severe bullying and abuse, and this year I re incorporated. I had pink hair and still have a style that kind of impacts some people. \n\nAll of this said, let's start :) \n\nSince I've been so out of touch with studying, it was hard for me to be in my last year of school, so I moved classes to one that is simpler for people who also struggle like me. In the first class we were all girls except for two boys; this ambient was very harsh and I was made fun of by multiple girls; some directly and some behind my back. It was hard, I thought I was strong enough to endure it but I couldn't and ended up missing a bit for school. \nIn this new class I just don't fit with anyone. People are clearly divided into some groups: the people who only disturb and cause chaos, a group of noisy people, alternative kids and some others. \nAt first I tried to socialize with everyone, but it was clear that they had no intention to reciprocate; it was uncomfortable to be honest. \n\nI'm a really, really emotional person. I try to be rational as much as I can and not get affected by random things that should not matter to anyone. My HSP makes super hard and tiring to just exist in class, with all the things I have to learn and all the distractions. \n\nFor me, the mere idea of being rude to someone is just unthinkable. It feels unnatural, strange. \nSo, even if I've already dealed with bullies in the past, people who are subtly rude shock me. Not just the fact that I don't expect it, but how natural it seems for them and how no one reacts even a bit to it. \n\nI'm also learning to shut up, because I don't seem to know how to close my mouth sometimes (I think it's due to being nervous). \n\n\nSo, here is my question: how do I actively stop caring. I know the basics; I know these people mean nothing in my life and won't be of any sort of help for me, but I can't help to get affected by their actions. I need to stop looking for acceptance in them, but it's just so awkward to exist so many hours in such an ambient. \n\nThank you for reading so far :)",

        "text": "So, I'm in college, freshman year, 18, all that. I also work at one of my school's dining halls, but I'm quitting for reasons other than what I'm about to explain.\n\nToday I was at the deli counter making sandwiches, and there was a rack behind me with oranges, apples, and bananas. About 2 hours into my shift I noticed that one of my coworkers had taken the fruit from the rack and put it on another stand that was easier for the customers to reach. Whatever, right?  Well, I see this and for some reason, I just go up behind him and stare.  I don't know why I did it, maybe I thought it was funny to be fake outraged by something as small as this. But the guy doesn't know me, so how would he know my intentions? That's not fair at all. So after he sees me, he says something along the lines of \"I'm not intimidated by you, Harry Potter\" (I have round glasses) and I walked away without saying anything and he adds to it \"Yeah, that's what I thought\" and I couldn't get it out of my head the entire rest of my shift. Now I don't know what to do, because I'll probably never see him again, but also I'm realizing how immature it was of me to not only do that to him but also have this crybaby reaction. So I ask you, what do I do now? and why do I feel like there are planets on my shoulders?",

Not really even any acquaintances. \n\nOne guy i recently met up with doesn't want to meet up with me anymore because im not his type (honestly for this guy i didn't really like him either so fair)\n\nAnother girl wants to and does meet up with other people but has been ignoring me. Im 80% sure its intentional and she just doesn't want to meet up with me. There's other reasons for me thinking this but it'll make the post too long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt feels like no one likes me. It feels like even online where you can't really see my lack of social skills that much people still don't like or want to hang out with me. I don't know why and its so frustrating like other people can talk and hang out but i can't. And then the brings up questions of like, am I the problem? Do I need to change? How do I change?\n\nAnd like, maybe my problem isn't my social skills maybe theres something inherent within me that makes people not like me.

Try to meet more people until I find one that does like me because its just by chance that everyone I've met or interacted with doesn't like me?",

In my first year of university I went to a whole bunch of social events and sometimes they would go well with me either playing some fun games with people or having some decent conversation but then other times those wouldn't happen and I would just end up sadder and even lonelier then I was before and I get left questioning whether I even want to try given that trying makes things worse.\n\nIdk i guess this sort of is just a rant after all.\n\nBut, there's always more people to meet and more classes to have and more club events and more people to reach out to, so here's to hoping for a better future.",

        "text": "So, long story short, I ran through an elementary school friend on the street, talked a bit and he aked for my Whatsapp and my Instagram so we wouldn't lose contact. I thought it would be the usual \"oh cool, now we have each others numbers, but we will never talk\" kind of thing.\n\nBIG MISTAKE. Now this dude messages me on a monthly basis to check on how I'm doing. Thing is, I HATE small talk, specially over text. Told him I work/study all day (actually true), take days to reply, tried making the conversation dry, but bro is UNSHAKEN \n\nHow do I make him stop without being an AH? I really don't wanna say \"I don't feel like talking\" and also don't wanna plain ignore/block him. Just make the conversation end to a point of no return\n\nHelp. Please.",

        "text": "I recently got feedback from a friend where she told me that she feels as if I don't want be there or interact with other friends in a group setting. \n\nShe feels like she is talking to me rather than with me. The distinction is that she is under the impression I am agreeing to everything she is saying without agreeing. She is annoyed that while she is talking, I am only saying \"right.\" I say that because I want to show that I am listening and I don't want to interrupt her. However, it is clearly coming across as not being present and actually listening and processing what she is saying.\n\nAnother issue that was brought up was that because I do not regularly show my emotions on my face, people believe I do not enjoy their company. They believe I don't want to be there. I do have resting bitch face, and I do get self concious easily and find it hard to smile on purpose. Ehat advice, do you have to make it look like I'm comfortable and interested talking to people ? It would help me a lot right now with the way people assume I do not enjoy their company. I feel like this would also help me in situations where I do feel nervous and uncomfortable. It would help give me a relaxed and confident air, so other people feel comfortable talking to me.\n\nWhat tips and solutions do you guys have ?",

        "text": "So this has been on my mind for awhile and I was wondering what y’all thought \n\nTo give a backstory, there’s this girl I kinda had a thing with it in high school. We go back to freshman year. \n\nI believe she liked me freshman year. She put some “signs” out (not gonna go into detail). Sophomore year rolls around and she starts to act a little bit rude to me and I believe it’s because she liked me but I never made a move on her so she’s being a bitch. I wished her happy birthday one day and she left me on opened and then removed me. \n\nFast forward to a few years now, I’ve added her again and she added me back. One day at the beach, senior skip day was going on. I said hi to her and her friend (whom I liked at the time) and at some point, she walked up to me and starts trying to chat with me. At one point, her friend tells me she wants to take a picture with me and we do. They both laugh giddily (if that’s a word) and I tell this girls friend to send me the pic. She jokingly says, “yea Insta” and the girl freaks and goes, “no! Not with a shirt that says that!” (That day had a theme of “white lie” where you would write a silly white lie about yourself. Her lie was “my ass is not fat.”) we sorta “split up” but she continues to start brief conversation with me asking about the college I was going to and what I was studying. I tell her and she replies, “Nice!” enthusiastically. I then ask her the same and the enthusiasm seemed to die down (although this could’ve been my mind playing tricks with me). I continued to talk to her throughout the rest of the day. \n\nFast forward to a few days later, I talk to her again and that level of enthusiasm she had kinda was there. \n\nA few days later, I ask her to sign my yearbook and her high pitched voice was there again. \n\nOkay so months go by and I see on Snapchat that she has removed me again. \n\nSo what does all this mean? What’s possibly going on in her head around this time?",

I feel like I'm just being used again for information. She would ask me for advise or how to write some email or whatever in the past, and I'd give her the advice, then she'd criticize it, saying something like \"why would you do that blablabla\". I don't have pet insurance. And I don't want to tell her that because I think she'll judge me. Would it be ok to just ignore it?  I want to move on with my life and make better friends",

I feel like I run out of topics or conversation starters sooner. Or it's just how the conversation naturally goes (from myself and the person I'm talking to) if I'm catching up with people. Complaining about work, about significant others, friends, life, etc. I also think I have more of a negative thought process/outlook in general (higher in neuroticism) so I think this will always be somewhat of a more uphill battle, but I guess I'd ultimately like the conversations to have a little more depth to them also. I find that being negative/complaining also brings connection, so I definitely crave feeling like I connected with the person, too and sometimes complaining brings that more quickly\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice on how to be a bit more balanced in conversations?",

        "text": "\nThis past fall semester, I joined a research clinic I was super passionate about. They already had enough RAs for fall but said I could do desk work and join in the spring if there are any openings. My fall semester was alright. Although I wasn't doing any research, I got a general sense of the clinic and the people there.\n\nI'm a bit quiet but will try to strike up a conversation (though I'm a bit awkward at it at times) as I should do my best to represent the clinic as the first person participants see when they walk in. I've still struggled to connect with the people at the clinic and have been cordial for the most part. This Spring I was excited to finally join as an RA. I know most of the research is data collection and the \"cool stuff\" is scattered throughout, nonetheless, I thought I would get a lot of hands-on things to do.\n\nOne of the recruiting grad students forgot to give me instructions on doing training material in the fall when I was free, and I was given a week to complete this right at the beginning of the spring semester, that too on a time crunch. Along with my other classes, it did take me more than a week for me to finish up the training, and there was a lot of back and forth between me and another supervising grad student to get all the necessary certifications in. She seemed pretty understanding of it for the most part. She also felt more like a peer to me, as she was in one of my classes as a senior the previous year.\n\nIt's 2 months in, and tbh, I haven't really been doing much at the lab. I'm supposed to shadow them in data collection during participant trials, and have been given some menial number calculation tasks to do. Also, scheduling isn't very stringent. I've asked around, and the general consensus is I come in whenever I'm available. I'll show up, but most of that time is spent sitting around. I'm also very quiet and awkward, so it's been hard connecting at a personal level.\n\nToday a midterm grade popped up for me online and it was a B. The classmate grad student said this grade isn't a reflection of the final grade but a check-in for the semester. Her reasoning was that she would like to see improvements in overall organization/time management. Commitment and productivity will likely improve with better organization/management of deadlines and expectations.\n\nI can understand her perspective but would like to reach out and talk about it in person. I don't believe I've been given any task of importance and I feel like the organization from the lab's end also plays a role in my overall performance. But, I also would like to wholeheartedly improve as an RA. How do I approach this situation?",
