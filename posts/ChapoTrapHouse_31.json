        "text": "Why do blacks commit so many crimes. Its in their culture. Why have jews been notoriously exiled and scapegoated in Europe. Its in their culture.\n\nYes, I unironically believe this to be true. The difference though is that a zionist who believes Palestinian culture is terrorist like and sewage prone (shapiro and most jews) and your average t_d poster who believes black culture is thuggish and predisposed to crime, believe its because the one thing cultures of these groups all have in common, their RACE.\n\nWhereas their cultures developed this way because of the material conditions surronding them that led them to be treated in such a way that caused them to develop such cultures.\n\nBlacks developed this black culture in america because of their treatment by society at large. And jews being ostracized further entrenched their anti-assimilation culture. It was the material conditions of feudalism, which capitalism carries on, that led the kings and dukes of yore to blame jews for whenever their was a problem to take the heat off their backs.\n\nsame as the capitalist class does today by exploiting the black man, keeping him in the ghetto, then distracting from the the capitalists practice of thievery by focusing the news camera on the black community as the reason society is so fucked up, rather then focusing on the reasons that made black culture this way (capitalism) or made jews so insular throughout the medieval ages (scapegoating because of feudalism)\n\nim willing to rethink this if pointing out that black culture is problematic is infact problematic or if theres research to show jews were scapegoated not because of feudalism but for something else.

Because he sucks up to the guy who insulted his wife — by retweet, no less. Because of his phony piety and even phonier principles. Because I see him as the spiritual love child of the 1980s televangelist Jimmy Swaggart and Jack Nicholson’s character in “The Shining.” Because his ethics are purely situational. Because he makes Donald Trump look like a human being by comparison. Because “New York values.” Because his fellow politicians detest him, and that’s just among Republicans. Because he never got over being the smartest kid in eighth grade. Because he’s conniving enough to try to put one over you, but not perceptive enough to realize that you see right through him. Because he’s the type of man who would sell his family into slavery if that’s what it took to get elected. And that he would use said slavery as a sob story to get himself re-elected. Otherwise, you might say I’m his No. 1 fan.\"\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/ted-cruz-serpent-covered-vaseline-bret-stephens-nyt-treats-americans-suckers-1137248",

        "text": "Beto is that dude who’s dating your ex-girlfriend who you hate so you get drunk and decide to vandalize his car because you know you can’t really compete with him in any category. Then when you pull up he’s in the front yard teaching your ex’s nephew how to throw a spiral and this kinda hurts because the kid never even talked to you at family functions so you lose your nerve and go to walk away but Beto sees you and sees the pillowcase full of spray paint cans you brought with you to spray paint “gay” on his Dodge Charger and he’s like “Ted?” (Because you’re Ted Cruz in this scenario)\n\nAnd you’re like “Oh hey Beto... I was just.... I had to... I was gonna paint a...wall....nearby.”\n\nAnd he starts to put it together in his head what’s happening so he tells your girls nephew to go inside and do 20 push-ups to get his throwing arm big and strong and then he high fives the kid and the kid runs inside without even saying hi to you. \n\nSo you’re like “What’s up man?”\n\nAnd he walks up and shakes your hand and pulls you in for a bro-hug and then looks you in the eyes and sincerely asks you how you’re doing. \n\nIt takes you a few seconds to answer becasue nobody has asked you that since the break-up. Your friends haven’t even asked you that. You try to give a fake platonic answer and for some reason you get this lump in your throat. You can’t force any words out and before you know it you’re crying for the first time in years and Beto brings you in for another hug and locks it in, holding you close while you sob uncontrollably.\n\n“I was gonna spray paint ‘gay’ on your car because... I hate you so bad for taking her from me.... but I’ll never hate you.... as much.... as I hate myself”\n\nWhen you say that last part the waterworks really kick in. You’re a mess, you’re weeping into Beto’s chest because he’s like 7 inches taller than you and he just keeps patting your back and saying “You gotta love Ted, man. Ted has to love Ted.” \n\nHe’s even crying a little too because he’s a genuinely good person and this is a sincerely emotional moment. \n\nHe stands there for as long as you need him to and after a few minutes you feel better. You end the embrace and take a step back. You look him in the eye and tell him thank you. And then you ask him to take good care of her and he says he will. Then he tells you to take good care of yourself. Y’all hug one more time and you walk away sheepishly with your pillowcase full of spray paint cans. \n\nBeto watches you leave and then goes back inside and your ex is like “who was that?” and he says “Nobody” and then blows her back out twice before falling asleep watching your Hulu account.",

        "text": "All these socialism boards are filled with social justice warriors that think socialism is about black lives matter and have never read Karl Marx in their life. It's about workers rights, and the flaws of capitalism nothing else. 90% of you morons interpret it as killing the white man. There are even feminists who call real socialism brocialism and it's a board on Reddit here. You people have not a clue about socialism and will get no support from me. Get your minds out of the gutter first, socialism isn't about transgender bathrooms, sorry to break the news to you.\n\nAnd another 75% voted for Hillary Clinton!!! LOL talk about the sheer retardedness if you think you are socialist and voted for Hillary Clinton because you think she was the \"lesser evil\" lol she WAS the evil, and you people are NOT socialists, you are posers!\n\nSee how long you pussies make it till you get ban happy for me telling you the truth.\n\nYou pos**t**ers hate the truth.",
