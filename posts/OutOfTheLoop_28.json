My initial thoughts were that this was just one of many topics in the US where one side feels one way and the other side feels the polar opposite. However, I’ve started to think this particular issue/word choice is more nuanced than that. Is the term offensive? Do the terms Latino, Latina, and Latin cover anyone of Latin descent without the need for the additional term? Why do some people seem incredibly miffed about this word?\n\nI’m linking the article that reignited my curiosity below. \n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/02/02/politics/connecticut-latinx-ban-bill-cec/index.html",

The island is super hard to invade which is one reason why Taiwan exists in the first place. What would the PRC gain from this other than an ideological victory? At what cost? They're not stupid.\n\nMy understanding is that China teaches its people that Taiwanese people are still Chinese citizens. Chinese state media repeats this all the time, and I presume that means its the official position of the PRC. To them, Taiwan is just a defiant province of a unified China. How could they justify the mass killings of (in their minds) their own citizens? The Tianeman Square catastrophy was bad enough for people to deal with. This would be a country wide massacre of their \"own\" citizens.\n\nWhat am I missing here? Why do people think the PRC would ever invade the ROC?",

But I’ve recently noticed a lot of memes, especially on Twitter, about football players reading the “script” for their upcoming games, and lots of people calling NFL games scripted in the way that wrestling matches are (as in, the outcome is prewritten, and the whole game is just a source of entertainment). I’ve even seen people say that football players’ personal lives are also scripted, the way that wrestlers and matches will have their own storylines and fictional backgrounds. What’s up with that?\n\n(https://twitter.com/tljensen13/status/1620884147811287041)",
