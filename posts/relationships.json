Rose has a daughter, Lola, she is 9. Her father, John (42M) is quite present in her life and is a good dad ( he lives 2 hours away due to his work but he spend a lot of time with her during the weekends, holidays, they video chat a lot, he comes to all her school plays, sport events etc etc).\n\nWhen I started dating Rose, I didn't know what my relationship with Lola would be. I have had both a step-mother and a step-father so I know these kind of relationships can get bad easily, so I tried to do my best. I played with her, listened to her whenever she wanted to talk, helped if she needed help and I didn't set any rule but made sure she followed Rose's rules. In the past 6 years, we bonded.\n\nSomething happened yesterday: she aced a math test (the only full score in the whole class. Am I allowed to be proud of her? I will be anyway). I wanted to reward her and she wanted an ice cream, so we went to the ice cream shop. When I gave her the ice cream, she said \"thank you, dad\" and rushed back in the car. I was stunned. I didn't know how to react. She never called me dad, she normally call me by my name or nickname. She seemed to not realize she had done it so I acted normally and brought her back home and we celebrated with Rose.\n\nI don't know what I should do if she calls me dad again. I'm happy about it, don't misunderstand me. I love her as if she was my own daughter but she already has a father and they love each other a lot and I think he wouldn't like hearing her call someone else \"dad\". Should I tell her something?

I always had a crush on her, but I was genuinely friends with her at the same time. Her family wasn't too fond of her being friends with me because her father was very judgemental (he's White and didn't want his daughter hanging around Latinos + I am Latino).\n\nNot only that, her father is very judgmental towards people like me becauss not only my race. But also because I have a lot of tattoos around my body. Long story short. There was a huge fire due to a gas leak in their house. I was over at her place and I was going home , but she called me back panicked because there was a fire.\n\nShe amd the rest of her family got out but her dad was stuck in their house and she and her mother couldn't go back so I had turned back around. I took a lot of physical pain to help her father because I went in and helped her father out through a window. I got burns all over my body and I had some very bad cuts that left nasty scars when I broke the window. I was able to recover, but the scars still hurt and it was the worst thing I had ever physically gone through.\n\nAfter that incident, her dad completely chamged his attitude about me and now he likes me. We get together I'd say daily to have a coffee in the morning, or to grab some lunch. Not only that, we started traveling together and he treats me like a son now and he told me that he would very much want me as his son in law and he said he'd like a guy like me for his daughter.\n\nNow, I have respected my best friends boundaries after she rejected me like a year back. She said she wasn't ready to start dating seriously, but she texted me and asked if I could go on a date with her. She planned a whole weekend away for us and this is what I've wanted with her. The thing is I don't know if it's genuine because she only asked me out after the incident with her dad. \n\nI don't want her to feel like she owes me anything because she doesn't and I want her to be with me because of genuine interest, not because I helped save her father. I don't know whether or not I should even bring this conversation up to her because I don't want to look or be disrespectful. So what do you guys think I should do regarding the date and how I could see if she's in it for just me and not because of me helping her?\n\nTLDR: Best friend rejected me a while back and said she wasn't ready to start dating. We stayed friends and I helped save her dad's life after their hohse caught on fire and he was stuck in there. She asked me out after that incident, but I don't want her to feel like she owes me anything.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678665236.0},{"title":"My (23 F) boyfriend\u2019s (24 M) family makes me second guess a future with him","author":"strawberrybearaffair","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11pg9t7\/my_23_f_boyfriends_24_m_family_makes_me_second\/","text":"I want to start this out by saying that I love my boyfriend very much and want a future with him. We've been dating a year and a half and have recently been talking about marriage. The only thing keeping me from 100% committing to marrying him is his family. For context, he has a very large family with 9 siblings and over 20 nieces and nephews. I on the hand am an only child of a single mother. Since i first met his family they didn't seem to like me. They never did anything overtly rude at first but never tried to get to know me or talk to me. When i talked to them they always shut down the conversation very quickly. At first i thought that that was just their personalities but then i realized i was the only person they ever did that with. After a few months they started doing more obviously rude things\/ doing things to exclude me that i won't get into right now. I've never been able to figure out why they do this because i've never done anything rude to them and have bought all of them and their children gifts for holidays and birthdays.\n\nFor the second half of this post i want to clarify that i am in no way judging anyone and i understand that every person\/family has their own issues and aren't perfect.\n\nThe only word i can use to describe his family is chaotic.\nIt seems like every day something is happening. His siblings have all had quite a few arrests or issues with the law in general. Almost weekly someone is arrested or has court. That itself isn't a problem for me. The problem comes in when it begins to impact our life. Our plans routinely get canceled because someone's been arrested and needs money or someone to watch their kids. We are constantly babysitting for his family which is fine but his siblings will come home hours after expected or sometimes just come home the next day, leaving us stuck with their kids. His brother is always getting evicted and has to come and stay with us. And his sister is always needing to borrow large amounts of money from him or his parents.\n\nI understand that family comes first but he will do whatever they ask of him. It's getting to the point where most of his free time is spent taking care of his siblings or their kids. He also never defends me when his family is\nrude or excludes me from things. I love him and want to be with him but i can't imagine my life forever revolving around his family. \nI don\u2019t know what to do at this point \n\nTLDR; his family is very \u201cchaotic\u201d and he spends most of his free time and money fixing their problems or watching their children.

My boyfriend (22) and I (20) have been together for almost 8 months. The problem is that I have a serious problem with people who rage over video games.  I like to play for fun and I've always been around chill people.  But he always takes everything seriously and that's problematic for me.  When playing, he complains and shout a lot.\nI grew up in a home where screaming was a sign of violence and it traumatized me a lot.  I can't stand any sign of anger anymore (from anyone), even if it's not against me.  It just makes me panic.  \nOf course, I talked to him about it MANY times.  I told him that I couldn't hear him screaming anymore when he plays, at first he told me he was going to make an effort but I have the impression that it's getting worse and worse.  \nEvery time he screams, I have a horrible feeling in my body for a few seconds, like I'm devoid of stress.  I don't know how to explain it, but it's a really awful feeling.  This feeling only happens when he plays next to me. When we are calling, it doesn't scares me, it just annoys me deeply.  \nI've been particularly sensitive lately. I spent a few days at his home and every time I heard him scream because of the game, it made me stressed and I end up crying.  He asked me what was going on, I told him that I couldn't take it anymore.  The problem is that he plays in a professional team and therefore video games are his whole life.  He explains to me that he wants to accomplish his dream despite everything and that he is finally about to accomplish his goal but that if at each end of the game he sees me crying, he will never be able to achieve it.  It really makes me feel guilty.   \nHe often tells me that he needs me to support him in what he does, but it's so hard.  He tells me that I don't accept him as he is.  We almost broke up a few days ago, because I was crying again from his screaming. He just got mad. He tells me that  when he yell, he's not mad at me and that I have to understand that.  But I do know it, but it doesn't change anything..  \nI really, really love him.  But I can't support him in his project.  I would like to, but I just can't. For me now, him playing games means rage and so sadness n anger.\nYet I know he needs my support.  I want to be a best girlfriend for him but this situation is really, really upsetting me.  I used to play video games a lot but I stopped because playing with him was simply impossible, he's not having fun.  I don't want to leave him, beyond that he really takes care of me.  (He's not violent at all.) \nPlease help me, I really need kind advice. I want to fix the problem, not breaking up. Thanks for reading me.\n\nEDIT : We just broke up.  I tried to talk to him about that but he said that \"I don't understand him\". I'm just... damn.\nThanks anyway for advices.

My now, and soon to be ex-wife of 4 years and I decided to try opening up our marriage to spice things up a bit. I knew this was something she wanted as she had mentioned it before, and to be honest, I thought it might be fun as well. However, I was a little hesitant due to thinking it may have a negative impact on our marriage (i.e. talking to others would take attention away from us, etc.) I decided to go along with it to make sure she was satisfied.\n\nGrowing up in church, monogamy and all things associated were engrained into my subconscious. I loved this woman, and still do. I was afraid she might leave me based on a couple of incidents in our past. She lied to me a few times, and even went to see a guy behind my back on one occasion. Naturally I had some insecurities about myself and our marriage after these events.\n\nAt first, she was only bi curious. We invited a couple of different girls into our bedroom. It was fun, I enjoyed it, but felt a little guilty for having sex with someone else, even though my wife was there participating and enjoying it. I was open to continuing though because it was something her and I were sharing together, and I felt it was bringing us a little closer.\n\nThen it started snowballing into her wanting a sugar daddy (which is crazy because we both make really good money together and can pretty much have anything we want), then it turned into she wanted to have FWB with several men. This is all within a 2-week period. \n\nWe started this back in late January. She was going out with someone new almost every night. I was having trouble finding someone to go out with. So, I'm at home alone most nights while she's out, and she's having sex with new partners. I was miserable. I couldn't stand the thought of another man being with my wife, and I knew if I were to go out and have physical intimacy with someone else, it would feel strange and at the end of the day, the only person I would want is her. I felt awful for even trying to make plans with another woman even though my wife knew what I was doing and encouraged it. I went through this pain over the next month and a half.\n\nThere were some positives - our sex life improved, and it also motivated me to find new things to try in the bedroom. I actually found something just before we decided to separate where I could actually make her orgasm.\n\nI talked to my wife several times and expressed that I didn't like this and that I wanted her to want me again, and only me. My feelings were dismissed a lot. I was told they were stupid because she'd never leave me. I was called a p\\*\\*\\*\\* because I was upset\/crying. She knew I was upset and continued to do it anyways. She kept telling me that I came 1st, but when I asked her to stop, she got mad\/defensive. If I truly came 1st, wouldn't she be willing to stop and focus on me?\n\nI had a therapy session this week and my therapist suggested maybe trying some time apart would do some good. I mentioned that to my wife, she was concerned why I wanted to go back home for a few days. I was honest, told her I wanted to go see my family and clear my head - then, the flood gates opened. I let out all of my feelings, told her I wanted this to stop and I wanted us to focus on her and I only and I wanted to stop this lifestyle. She said that would be a problem if I wanted her to stop.\n\nAt that point, I said I was done and was walking away. She got mad, saying it wasn't fair because she allowed me to have sex with 2 other women while she watched, called me a hypocrite, said I was a p\\*\\*\\*\\* and always will be. Said she was going to finally due what she wanted for once and she felt she always had to accommodate for me.\n\nI was nothing but good to this woman. I gave her everything she ever wanted. Never laid a hand on her, always treated her with respect\/chivalry. I felt like I gave my all in this marriage. Yet, I'm just struggling thinking this is all my fault, when I know logically it wasn't. Her own mother even told me not to think I wasn't good enough for her, and that I was. She said we just met at the wrong time and she had a 'wild' streak she needed to work through. I can't wait on her to do that. \n\nHow can I get through this and feel better about myself and my decision to leave? I'm heartbroken. My self esteem is low, and I feel like I'll never find a good woman who will love and appreciate me and everything I have to offer.\n\n**TL:DR** \\- Wife and I agreed to open marriage, I didn't like it once we got into it. I asked her for us to stop, she denied, and I said I was walking away.

A few weeks ago something came up that was gonna be expensive for her and it stressed her out a lot and she was kinda mean to me that night. She told me that night that I \u201cwasn\u2019t worth it\u201d for how she missed how much her parents would pay for and when I asked if she wanted to break up she said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d then didn\u2019t talk to me until apologizing in the morning. The next evening we talked and she doubled down on me being not worth it and was kinda half listening to me. Ever since that night I haven\u2019t felt the same about her and have been hurt. I told her how I felt the other night and how if I\u2019m not worth it then what\u2019s the point? We talked it out it ended with her saying \u201cI\u2019ve apologized but now it\u2019s up to you to get past it\u201d which is true I do want to get past it but she kinda makes it seem like I shouldn\u2019t still be hung up on it. So am I holding onto it for no good reason or do I have the right reason to still be hurt?\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: my gf said I wasn\u2019t worth it and never apologized for it and I\u2019m still hurt by it even though she said it\u2019s up to me to get past it now that she apologized a few days ago.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678654471.0},{"title":"I (30F) don't find my partner (30M) fun, not sure what to do.","author":"radiostardust","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11pn3yf\/i_30f_dont_find_my_partner_30m_fun_not_sure_what\/","text":"We've been together for 6 years.

However, I just don't find him exciting. I've found previous partners more fun and laughed a lot with them. With him, it feels like so much time spent in silence. As an extrovert, I find this more and more frustrating. I find I act out because I am seeking some stimulation from him. I'll tickle him, annoy him, just to get some reaction. He's not creative, fun-loving, or adventurous. He wants to eat the same foods, and do the same hobbies. He is happy having 3 friends who he sees once per month.

Even though we are compatible sexually, with what we want for our futures, and our morality, it's this fundamental personality difference that is starting to get to me. When I'm working a lot I don't notice it because my own social\/emotional bandwidth is smaller. But, I started a new job where I am much less stressed and all of a sudden these problems are back on the table for me. I'm scared because I love him and we are planning our futures.

We\u2019ve dated a little over half year.\n\nWe have been dating less than a year, have tons of mutual friends and everything seemed to be going great \u2026until recently. I am in grad school I\u2019m constantly studying and when I\u2019m not studying I try to make plans with friends or my boyfriend (he knows grad school is time consuming). My boyfriend works two jobs and didn\u2019t finish college. So he works a lot to be financially secure. Which means when I\u2019m free he\u2019s typically at work or vice versa. We hang out a lot just catching up, watching a few shows and then ultimately just going to bed because we are tired from our schedules. \n\nProblem starts: \nThe last few weekends I made plans with my friends for Saturday. I\u2019ve made these plans weeks before. Every time I see him after these plans I feel like he\u2019s upset with me. He makes comments like how he feels like he\u2019s not invited after we have a girls only dinner and then invite him to the bars but it\u2019s already so late (wasn\u2019t invited previously because we didn\u2019t know we\u2019d go out other bfs are there\/show up ). Also, he is invited to things but has work so he can\u2019t go. Like my friends and I went to an event he was invited but couldn\u2019t go because work which bummer but I\u2019m not upset because i understand work. After event we go to dinner and invite him, he has tight budget and said no he will meet us later which he did. I thought everything was going well. Then we get back to his and he lays out a ton of issues and was very emotional and drunk:\n\n1. He says it\u2019s not my fault but he feels inadequate he can\u2019t provide for me. Which I find kind or insulting as I take pride in being financially dependent from a man. I also don\u2019t understand what he means by provide. We are young and dating not married. And I said he provides enough emotional support, providing just isn\u2019t money but he seems to not get that. And it worries me it\u2019s a point of contention because after grad school I will likely be the breadwinner, which I have zero problem with as long as my s\/o isn\u2019t bumming off me\/making me feel used (I don\u2019t see how the difference from a man financially providing for a woman in marriage, to a woman financially providing for a man. Unless there\u2019s some unspoken thing I don\u2019t know about that men expect? Like i know they expect free childcare sometimes but that\u2019s not the point and not what I\u2019m getting at) \n\n2. That he feels like \u201cwe don\u2019t have quality time together\u201d. He has \u201cput ZERO effort in planning actual activities\u201d, I said that to him and he said he doesn\u2019t have money. Which upsets me as I feel like that\u2019s an excuse: I\u2019m more than happy to go on a walk or visit a free museum or have a picnic or even a planned movie night. He then says due to his past he can\u2019t plan because he\u2019s been gaslight about plans before. Which frustrates me an stresses me into making all the plans. So he wants planned quality time but can\u2019t plan it. \n-we do, do dates and stuff but I usually plan it. \n-I ask him to go on walks or walk around town and it\u2019s usually he\u2019s too tired or blows it off. \n\n3. He\u2019s making me guilty for hanging out with friends. I\u2019m starting to feel like he wants me to wait around till he\u2019s off work to see if he wants to do something because he can\u2019t plan. I\u2019m a very social person with little time, I value my friendships if i Can plan to see my friends I will the once a week I see them. He mentioned he is jealous my friends can spend time with me more which i see them once a week for activity we plan in advance . Also said I chose them over him\n\n4. I got us tickets to a concert because I wanted to go and I know he loves an artist. I was excited and thought this would be a great memory for us. But 5 times he\u2019s brought up these tickets and that he feels bad I got them for us because they were expensive and he can\u2019t do the same. I got them because I thought it\u2019s was an activity we both could enjoy but now I\u2019m dreading the concert and I kind of don\u2019t wanna go because I feel like I shouldn\u2019t of got the tickets, I was just excited. I\u2019m debating if I should sell them if they\u2019re such a sore subject. Or letting him take a friend instead of me ( even tho i want to go i just feel guilty). I would feel bad selling them because he was excited about them I\u2019m just confused.  \n\n5. Valentine\u2019s Day I got excited and prepped him a cute basket. He made bfast at mine (like usual) with what I had and brought me flowers. He said he got me something and it wasn\u2019t in yet, which okay i understand. Then he says i can pick out nice sunglasses which i wasn\u2019t too keen about as they were expensive. He hasn\u2019t brought it up so i haven\u2019t as I do not want to force him to get me nice gift. He mentions last night how he\u2019s sad he can\u2019t get me nice gift . Which I I don\u2019t need honestly i preferred a nice heart felt card but didn\u2019t even get that. Like literally anything sentimental I would\u2019ve been happy with. He says it\u2019s money but then he can spend money drinking at bar which he doesn\u2019t do a lot but I\u2019m like the price of one beer is enough for a card. (Haven\u2019t mentioned to him this bothered me)\n\n\nI sort of mentioned the above to him (besides vday) when he brought this up yesterday and all he says is I\u2019m not doing anything wrong it\u2019s just how he feels. Which leaves me confused. Like I\u2019m glad he can share his feelings and be emotional but i feel like he\u2019s blaming me and. I just feel guilty.

There\u2019s always a reason\u201d and then followed by \u201cDo your friends want to go or smt?\u201d And then I said \u201cWell yeah my friends did mention they want to go with me sometime\u201d\n\nHe then said \u201cI knew someone asked!\u201d And then he proceeded to ask me if I\u2019m still going to this rave later this month. I told him \u201cyeah maybe..\u201d\nAnd then few conversations later, he straight up told me \u201cJust be straight forward next time \u2018maybe\u2019 isn\u2019t a yes or no to me and you saying just looking at a club for fun. \ud83e\udd28\u201d\n\nNow, he said this because he thinks no one looks up the club for no reason. He said \u201cLike why couldn\u2019t you just tell me your friends wanna go to the club? It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d And he told me I shouldn\u2019t say \u201cmaybe\u201d and should\u2019ve said yes or not because he thinks I\u2019m actually going to the rave, when in reality I\u2019m actually still thinking about going so that\u2019s why I said \u201cmaybe.\u201d\n\nHe thinks I\u2019m hiding something from him because I wasn\u2019t being that clear twice in the row. I might admit it\u2019s my fault for not clarifying it more with him because I did actually look up the club because my friends do want to go with me. But I looked up that club more specifically because I was randomly curious to see what it looks like, and I tried defending myself on that, but he just doesn\u2019t seem to believe me on this.\n\nBecause of that, he thinks I seemed so afraid of telling him that. But I was also truthful about saying \u201cmaybe\u201dabout going to the rave. I just didn\u2019t clarify the reason enough why I\u2019m still thinking about going in the first place.\n\nHe got upset at me and I tried telling him \u201cI\u2019d never lie or hide from you. I was actually looking up photos of the club randomly for fun. For the rave, I said maybe I\u2019m still actually thinking of going because our group isn\u2019t big enough, and I really wanted you to come, that\u2019s why I asked you to come. But I guess I\u2019ll be more clear next time.\u201d\nHe replied to that with \u201c \u201cI guess\u201d nice way to end it\u201d , referring to how I wrote \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be more clear next time\u201d in that text. And that\u2019s all after that.\n\nI tried my best to communicate with him and clear more things up for him, but he was giving me dry responses. I kept apologizing and reassuring him that I\u2019m being honest and I have nothing to hide from him and I\u2019m not afraid to talk to him, over and over. I can honestly understand how he thought I was hiding something last night because I wasn\u2019t being straightforward. But I also feel like he was being too hard on me last night.\n\nThis morning, I kept asking if we could call so we could talk about it and work on communicating more. He told me \u201cNo you did this to yourself, so not my fault\u201d and \u201cYou keep saying we need to communicate better and it\u2019s you that\u2019s screwing up\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear you say sorry anymore\u201d\n\nEventually I finally got him to call me and I tried apologizing again and explaining myself. But he gave me silent treatment for 10-15 mins and acted very upset and cold to me. He thinks I\u2019m just repeating myself over and over again on what I\u2019ve said on text beforehand, and how it\u2019s a waste of time for him. He thinks I can\u2019t change for what I did, and he doesn\u2019t want to think anymore. I told him I\u2019ll work on communicating better and he said \u201cWhatever I hope so.\u201d\n\nWe got silent after that and he said \u201cSo..are we done now?\u201d. I asked him if he\u2019s still upset with me and he kept dodging the question and he said he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. We said our byes and he hung up really fast.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. He hasn\u2019t texted me since then. I promised to him I\u2019ll work on communicating better. I don\u2019t want to be a bad girlfriend to him or someone that would just apologize for their behavior then turn around and do it again. I really did mean it when I apologized and I take responsibility of my actions and I saw how deeply it upset him. I should\u2019ve been more clear with him.\n\nI feel like this is completely my fault because we keep telling each other to communicate with each other well, but yet, we always end up in an argument. He\u2019s generally a very caring and loving person and loves me very much and is willing to work things out with me, no matter how bad it gets. But I don\u2019t know how I feel about last night. He\u2019s so upset with me and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I really want to make this relationship work and I am really willing to do whatever it takes. I don\u2019t want this relationship to turn out unhealthy, especially since we\u2019ve been dating for only a month and we already started arguing.\n\nKeep in mind, we constantly text each other throughout the day. More than we facetime\/call each other.

During that party, I didn't taste the cake because they allowed their youngest child to repeatedly wipe it with their fingers and lick. Her ex did it too.\n\nI'm successful after years of struggling to make myself visible career wise. I achieved some major goals with my companies so I decided to take a year off and take a mental health break. I moved into a tiny studio at a lower cost area where there's almost no amenities. I love this place.\u00a0\n\nLeanna hated it. She was vocal about it looking \"cheap\" and criticized the lack of decoration. I've kept it as is. It looks bare but I'm okay with that. It came with a small dining room set, a couch and a bed aside from the refrigerator and stove.\u00a0 She criticized that the things inside the apartment weren't fashionable and that I bought plates and cups from the local dollar store. For background, she's not wealthy or chic or anything. She just loves to criticize as a passive aggressive method.\n\nI'm not great at inviting people in because I prefer privacy and solitude. However, if I do, I always lock my computer and external memories inside a sentry cabinet that I bought for my home office because I need to protect my station now that it got financed and with contracts with very large companies.\u00a0\n\nImportant to the story: I turned the hole in the wall walking closet in my studio into a professional looking office for my zoom calls. I always lock the office if I have people coming in.\n\nShe has asked me many times about what's behind that door. I always say it's my walk in closet.\u00a0\n\nLast week, I came out of the bathroom and caught her with her hand shaking the door handle.\u00a0 She got red faced. I didn't say anything, but I made up an excuse for her to leave.\n\nThree days ago, she called me with a mysterious tone and refused to tell me what was going on and said she would tell me when we got here. I came out of the apartment and didn't let her in. I had a very bad feeling the minute she showed up with all of her belongings inside her car.\u00a0\n\nShe said her fiance kicked her out. I didn't say anything until she directly asked to stay with me. I said no. I live in a studio where I have no space. My bed is actually about 20 feet from the kitchen. She kept arguing and making ways around what I said. She said \"what about your walk in closet?\". I said no. Also, if I want to have a date I can't bring him in with her at my place. I told her she needed to go stay with her parents, who live 4 hours away.\u00a0\n\nShe left, but sent me texts with multiple instances in which I was a bad friend. She said what good it is to have friends if they don't do anything for you and that \"she knows I'm lying\" by carrying on a frugal lifestyle and sent me lots of links about my career and an article on one of my companies yearly turnover ( long story). Her daughter (who's an adult) and who removed me from social media years ago ( I think it's because I refused to do business with her mother), showed up with some plastic containers and a \"thanks for nothing\" attitude and said she was gonna leave the stuff at my place so her mom could come pick it up when she was settled. I said no, because Leanna was disrespectful and I wasn't interested and why can't she store her mothers things at her own place. The daughter has a fit and starts blaming me for her parents divorce. I asked her to listen to herself and to use reason. \n\nSo I confronted her with the fact that if she's telling me that because her mother missed out on a supposed chance to make money out of our friendship and her dad left the family, that means he's a f****** gold digger. That made it worse and she started crying and hitting the steering wheel and screaming. I told her she needed to leave and when she refused I lost my cool and I promised I would drag her out of the car and do my thing because I had it with them. Lianna called me blaming me for a supposed nervous breakdown of her daughter's and said I'm a cold witch and that her daughter could be on the road to self harm. \n\nAs far as I know this friendship is pretty much over but I'm still confused because I don't know why things turned out so badly so suddenly. I've been dealing with mild depression for years so I don't know if I even did something wrong. My thoughts aren't clear right now.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678630867.0},{"title":"Straight Girl Crush\/Friendship","author":"sapphicgoddess101","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11pwfnq\/straight_girl_crushfriendship\/","text":"(I identify as a lesbian and my friend identifies as a straight woman) F\/25 & F\/25 \n\nRecently I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time around a newer friend (within the last year).

She is in therapy, she had a horribly bad childhood and has very inconsistent parents even now, and she doesn\u2019t do the things she should to make the therapy and meds work (stop drinking, sleep enough, pick supportive friends, and find some kind of consistency or routines in her life besides me always being on standby as her bail out). I feel horrible for her. But it\u2019s really damaging my mental health and motivation and social life (since her safety blanket is knowing I\u2019m there for her, so if I leave town or am tied up for a while, not okay) in the process.\n\nAnytime she senses any tension from my end in the relationship she gets super anxious and will nearly cry and start asking me if I\u2019m breaking up with her and how she doesn\u2019t know how she would make it without me. I seriously worry she would have no support and might do temporary or permanent damage to her self\/body\/life if I left. \n\nHow do I exit without ruining a life? I have lost all love or lust for her (her lust went away a while ago it seems) romantically. I care about her in a friend\/family member way, but it\u2019s hard to love someone who treats you this way, even if I fully understand why she does it based on her past. The college transition really is where everything turned downhill and she begs me to just let her have her college experience and fight through it, but this isn\u2019t a typical college relationship, and I don\u2019t know if I believe it will be as much better after college as she thinks. She believes without all the crazy college influences that she will be better. But she says without me she doesn\u2019t think she can make it.

I'm a 20 year old (M) college student who used to work with a much older woman (35F). I always found her attractive. In my eyes she was the the prettiest woman I've ever seen in my life (she actually looked much younger than her age).\n\nAnyways we started talking at work and we had chemistry. We pretty much liked the same things and we had great conversations. As  time went on and on, things got more intimidating. She started starring at me in a very intimadating way. She also started texting me daily and consistently. I knew that she was in a relationship with another guy and i just thought she was just being friendly.\n\nBut one day, she told me to hang out after work together. And we did. I had an amazing time with her. I honestly haven't met anyone that interesting in my life. As i was walking her home, she caught me off guard and kissed me. It was the sweetest kiss I've had ever experienced. I told her i liked her a lot and so did she. I always had in my mind that i shouldn't get into other people's relationship and i genuinely felt bad about her boyfriend. But i couldn't resist to her, it was magical. \n\nWe worked for 3 months together (basically all summer). This was honestly the best time of my life. We started dating somehow. (we kept it between us, but we started seeing each other a lot). She's the most amazing woman I've ever met, idk if her age makes me think of that. Maybe it's her maturity Thad made me fell so hard for her? I'm not sure. Anyway, the thing after summer was over, i left the job, because of college. And after this happened she somehow disappeared. She suddenly started texting me rarely and she was cold, but nothing had happened between us. I kept texting her and asking about how she was, but after some time she ghosted me.\n\nIt's been half a year since we texted each other. I honestly can't stop thinking of her. She's been living in my head 24\/7, i can't concentrate on anything and most importantly in my studies. I just think of her and cry, i can't even listen to music anymore, because we had the same taste and the songs remind of her, why did she do that to me? Why she initiated the whole thing if she's was going to do that without explain anything to me. She promised me that she would keep in touch with me no matter what. And i believed her. I know the age gap is huge, but i didn't mind, that's what she said as well. I feel like i was being used.  \n\nI also bear in mind that she was cheating on her boyfriend, and i don't know if i would like to be with someone who's a cheater. I just feel so depressed and don't know how to get over her. I know some of you might say you can find other people as well, but i literally had one gorgeous girl asking me to have sex with her and i declined, because while she was talking with me, i was only thinking about her. It feels like I've developed an obsession with her and it's unhealthy. I've been with other women before, but this just felt so special to me, i can't really explain it. I feel so blank. I've been waiting for a text from her every single day, and the urge of texting her is huge, idk if she's gonna reply or not. did she just play me? I just crave of seeing her just one more time. She stigmatized me. Every other girl i meet, i subconsciously compare her to her and she's always better. I can't feel anything for other girls and it's been a long time. I'm so embarrassed of going to therapy because a woman 15 years older played me like that. \n\nTL;DR i had an affair with a much older co-worker, and when she left the job she stopped texting to me, but i can't get over her.\n\nPS: excuse me for my English, im Argentinian.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678650313.0},{"title":"Who's at fault - the talker or the receiver?","author":"heftynothankyou4446","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11pteba\/whos_at_fault_the_talker_or_the_receiver\/","text":"TLDR: When communicating, who's responsibility is it to make sure information is conveyed and received the correct way?

Our relationship ended about 2 years ago, and I have never experienced this level of hardship when it comes to getting over someone. We were only together for six months when I broke up with him due to feeling like I was being taken advantage of. He used my money without permission (actually took pictures of my debit card behind my back). He cut me off from all if my friends, because he didn't like me spending time with other people... not even my family. There was so much more as well, but I'm trying to keep this short. I asked for advice on this relationship before and I was advised to leave. I did, and since then I have desperately tried to get over him. I still cry to this day over how much I miss him. He gave me this feeling that I associate with what I believe being in love feels like. I have yet to feel it with anyone else. Anyways, we got into contact again, because he requested me on Instagram. Deep down I hoped he had maybe changed, but speaking with him only makes me realize that he's exactly the same... and I still love him regardless. It's extremely frustrating.\n\nI guess my question is... what is your opinion on love. Do you think that you should fight against all the problems that don't work in order to keep the person who has given you these strong feelings? I guess my biggest fear is that he's the only one I will feel this for. That he is the \"one\" and I'm giving that up.

We get along great and she's someone I truly click with on a level that I haven't experienced before. For the first year we knew each other, I was in a committed long-term relationship so our friendship was entirely platonic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat all changed when I broke up with my ex. Since then, my best friend has made passes at me while drunk twice and I've reciprocated. We've made out a few times and cuddled, but nothing more than that (at my insistence since I was recently single and didn't want a potential rebound situation to occur). However, each time this happened, the following day she would tell me that she thinks we should just be friends and that she's afraid of jeopardizing our friendship and potentially ruining the dynamic of our shared friend group. While this was upsetting to hear, since I do like her, we talked things out and I was actually ok with just remaining friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUs just being friends continued for a few weeks, with us still hanging out one-on-one and in group settings regularly, and things seemed to go back to normal. I even started moving on from the whole thing about a week ago and have begun getting ready to start dating again. However, last night we were drinking in a group setting and she was being extremely touchy and affectionate towards me, to the point that I'm sure other people in the group noticed. I'm not an idiot and could tell she clearly wanted to talk about something, so later that night when we were alone we talked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGist of the conversation is that she confessed she really does like me, more than a typical crush, and that she thinks she made a mistake and wants to try progressing our friendship to being more than friends. I'm feeling torn because while I really like her as person and am attracted to her, I also feel like I just started moving on from her and that I'm not as infatuated with her as I was a few weeks ago. Also, as cliche as it sounds, she's the first person I've known where I truly do feel scared about 'risking' our friendship if things don't work out. But at the same time, I know that it's rare to come across someone that you click with so well and are also attracted to, so my mind is all jumbled up. I asked her why she changed her mind (again), and she said that even though she's scared, she realized that she's just been giving herself excuses not to pursue a relationship and that seeing me in a new relationship with someone other than her would be upsetting and she wants to see if we can work. I told her that I need to think about things and that we need to revisit this conversation while sober, given that we've now had this same conversation 3 times when under the influence and each time she changed her mind again the following day. That said, it did feel different last night... it felt like she truly does feel differently than before and that the ball is in my court on if this happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has had similar experiences as me, and if they think it's a good idea to pursue a relationship with your best friend (especially with all the wishy-washiness going on). I really haven't made up my mind about this, so any insight\/advice would be appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Best friend has confessed her feelings for me multiple times while drunk but keeps changing her mind the next day. Did it again last night, but it feels different this time and like she really does want it, but I'm feeling conflicted. Looking for advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Met up with her today to hangout and I brought up Friday night with her. We talked about things again (while sober) and the good news is that she meant what she said on Friday. She wants to try progressing our friendship into a relationship. We talked about what that would look like, our fears, if we're going to tell our mutual friends, etc. We agreed that we're going to take things slow and let it progress naturally (i.e. we won't be hooking up or anything in the immediate future and won't start spending all of our free time together right off the bat). That way, if things for some reason don't work out, it'll hopefully be easier to go back to being friends if we haven't had sex or anything yet. I've never dated a close friend before, let alone a best friend, so this is all new to me and I'm sure it'll be a little awkward at first trying to see each other in a more romantic light. But I'm excited for what the future holds and optimistic that this could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship.

We are in a long-distance relationship for most of the year as we are both in school, but have summer (3 months) and winter break to see each other.\n\nWe really clicked with each other from the start, we have similar senses of humor, similar interests\/hobbies, and similar life goals. We talk every day during the school day, and then call\/play games together all evening\/night. She is really great, we laugh together and get each other, and have talked a lot about our future together. When we hang out in person when we both are home, we have an amazing time together and I wouldn't trade it for the world.\n\nHowever over the last year or so, when we have an argument, she has gotten a lot more difficult to resolve things with. She has become more and more in the mindset of \"I'm right, you're wrong\", and if I disagree with her, she just tells me that I'm \"not listening\" or I'm \"defending myself\", and gets mad at me for that. She almost never apologizes for anything, and she doesn't acknowledge that she does anything wrong.\n\nAbout 85% of the time, she will get mad at me no matter the issue, and wait for me to apologize and take the blame for everything, and then make her feel better. The other 15% of the time she takes all the blame on herself and gets very sad and depressed about it.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I brought this up with her and told her that I just want her to work on not going from 0 to 100 and instead just talking about our issues and trying to acknowledge my side. I don't want her to start apologizing for everything or anything like that, I just want to be heard every once in a while. However, its been 6 months and I have brought it up multiple times and nothing really has changed.\n\nIt just sucks because almost every argument we have, it just gets so out of control and then she just gets mean and doesn't let me have a side in the issue, and then she is just mad at me for 2 days. Every time. I am a massive believer in the fact that relationships are two-way streets and both people have different perspectives that can contribute to issues, and I just want a relationship where that is recognized but most of the time it just feels like a one-way street; her opinion is always the answer.\n\nI don't really know how to feel about this. I have given her a lot of time to work on this and I have been respectful of the time that it takes to fix issues like this because it's not easy to fix it just like that. But its been 6 months and it seemingly just keeps getting worse and worse and I feel like its just building up inside of me and any day now I won't be able to take it anymore. I just absolutely hate it because she is my dream girl, we get each other so well and I want to spend the rest of my life with her.

Last school year, we shared almost all of our \"social\" evenings together and up until 2-3 months ago that was still the case.\n\nImportant info: about 6 months ago, Sarah confided in me that she had just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Apparently she had been having \"strange symptoms\" for several weeks (without telling me what they were), and after several MRIs she had received this diagnosis. We didn't talk much about it because she didn't want to tell me more, but I felt at that moment that she was very affected...which is logical.\n\nIn the last few months, even though we didn't talk about it anymore, I felt that she was more and more distant. She went out less and less, and even shut herself up in her room more and more. At first I thought she was too preoccupied with her studies, but then I started to worry and one night (about 2 months ago) I asked her if everything was okay. She just told me \"you're right, I'm not okay but I don't want to talk about it\". This made me feel unsettled and worried but I respected her wishes.\n\nBut the weeks went by and I saw her more and more isolated, she hardly saw anyone anymore unless they came to our house. So I talked to her again yesterday in private in my room, asking her if I had hurt her unintentionally...telling her that I value our friendship and that I am worried about her.\n\nI didn't expect her reaction She burst into tears and told me everything. She told me that the \"weird symptoms\" in question were that she had lost control of her bladder and that apparently no treatment was working. I remembered a time when we were in the car together and she suddenly asked me if we could stop to go to the bathroom before she started crying a few seconds later, and telling me she was having \"a bad headache\".\n\nI was shocked to see her in such distress. She told me that she had lost control of her bladder that day, that I hadn't noticed because she was forced to wear diapers and that this situation made her so anxious that she didn't dare go out anymore. She is unhappy not to see anyone but going out in her condition is too stressful for her to handle. She also told me that she felt extremely guilty about avoiding me because she values our friendship, and about that at least I tried to reassure her as much as possible.\n\nShe told me she's seeing a shrink about it. I tried to reassure her, to tell her that even though we live together I never noticed anything, I suggested that we go on short trips together...but she said \"I'm too uncomfortable, I'm destroyed with shame\".\n\nI want to help her, this situation takes me to the guts, but I don't know how to go about it...I care about her and our friendship. And I feel really awkward about it, I don't know how to react without being intrusive...do you have any advice?\n\nTL;DR : my roommate\/friend suffers from incontinence and it has a big impact on her social life\/self-confidence.

To put it mildly, I (20F) am inexperienced with dating as I've lived a really sheltered life. I've told him that I'd like to keep this relationship a secret from my family and as I live with them, that's pretty hard. He seems fine with it, though he mentions often how he'd love to take me on a date.\n\nSo last night it started. We were flirting back and forth, and he suddenly called me Ms. Soft hips. Odd. But I went along with it while trying to understand why he'd call me that. We only said a few things in Ok Cupid before moving it to discord so 99% of our chat is through discord. I searched through our dm's for the word \"hips\" and only saw the recent convo popped up. Besides my overthinking, I kinda just tried to brush it off.\n\nThen all of a sudden, this morning, I have a text from him that says, \"But I'm pretty sure they would be a nice pillow\". What? It didn't make any sense in the convo that we'd had the night before. So, for the past 3 weeks, we've been like friends, and we constantly play games together. I went through all my ds games, and put my Wii back up, all so we could try to find games to play together.

I had a group of friends in high school and a best friend, however I'm no longer in touch with them as I moved away and those relationships were very one-sided (e.g. me being their therapist basically if you know what I mean, asking how they are, me making all the plans etc). In terms of making friends, I really do put in the effort and I've tried to make so much effort with people at work or people in general, I made a Bumble account - I met some people on there but then you just get ghosted and I'm constantly like 'did I say something bad???' I'm at the gym and have joined classes but no one really in my age group attends and it's just so hard.\n\nI had a complicated childhood involving abuse and just toxic relationships with boys and was dealing with all of this when I went to uni so I did miss a lot of my first year because I was dealing with PTSD\/mental health from that. Then Covid happened and everything moved to online so I basically had no human interaction during uni apart from my bf who I met in halls (who is basically my only friend right now haha).\n\nAnyways, I'm getting married this year which I'm so excited about but sometimes I do think it's just depressing that I have no one else so be excited with other than my partner (I have no family around due to the childhood stuff I was talking about). I just wish I had a girl friend or girls to plan a night out or go wedding dress shopping with. I'm sorry to sound selfish to anyone, but when you have no family you can feel so alone and like no one really cares about your existance.\n\nI think it is really hard to make friends as a girl, does any one agree? All my life I've had a lot of attention from boys who all seem to want to be your friend and hang out but never girls and I literally have no idea why. My partner seems to make friends with other guys so much easier. I would want nothing more than to be friends with another girl who wants to plan things and have my best interests at heart. I have no idea why nobody wants to be my friend and it really has started to knock my confidence and make me feel like there is something wrong with me. It just seems like I'm invisible all the time.\n\nI mean I genuinely do try to be a really nice person and would do anything for my friends, being kind to other people is really important to me and I feel like I'm quite bubbly\/confident (even though this post doesn't reflect that haha) and so I don't understand what is wrong with me.\n\nIt is just so depressing scrolling through instagram and facebook and seeing girls with lots of friends on their stories or feed and saying happy birthday to one another.\n\nAnyways, I hope people don't think I'm trying to be ungrateful. I know people have it a lot harder compared to me, I just wanted to post this to open a discussion and to let other people going through something similar that you're definitely not alone...Does anyone have any advice about this situation or how to just be okay with being on your own? At the moment I'm trying to focus on myself to rebuild my life from all the shit and just try to be confident in myself, getting my hair\/nails done, gym, trying to just be a strong\/confident person. It is hard though and I wanted to post this because if anyone my age is going through the same thing, trust me it seems like girls (and guys) my age all have friends but that is not the case at all - on the outside I might look like I have my shit together, nice house, partner and a good job. But in reality I don't have any friends and it does eat away at my confidence which definitely hurts.\n\nTL;DR - 22F and cannot make friends","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678633264.0},{"title":"Hi, I (m23) need your advice.

She\u2019s the most naturally beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen, no exaggeration. We met each other\u2019s families and things were getting serious\u2014saying \u201cI love you\u201d and making plans for our shared future\u2014right until she broke up with me out of the blue and without thorough explanation in April of 2020, about 8-9 months later. I was devastated and confused. I fought for the relationship for months but was rebuffed. \n\nIn July 2021 we run into each other after a year of no contact. She was in a relationship and I was single at the time. We went for dinner despite her relationship status. At this rendezvous of ours, she tells me I\u2019m \u201cas handsome as ever\u201d, and we continued seeing each other (semi) platonically for a couple of months. I know this wrong and I knew it then\u2014 she had a boyfriend and we shouldn\u2019t have been seeing each other. She frequently complained about her boyfriend to me (he was critical of her, flakey, much older than us). I told her early on in our reconnecting that I still had strong feelings for her and didn\u2019t want to hear about her boyfriend anymore; she told me that \u201cwas music to her ears, but that I might have to play the \u2018long game\u2019\u201d because she wasn\u2019t single.\n\nWell, she broke up with her then boyfriend not long after in October 2021, and we began sleeping together a few weeks later. Right before we slept together the first time, she told me she \u201cdoes love me, but is scared.\u201d After sleeping together, she would pull away frequently (say things like \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have done that\u201d) and she made a relationship impossible. I persisted. \n\nI got routinely hurt\u2014really badly\u2014by her cruel hot\/cold treatment of me. As an example, she had friends over one night and invited me. When I arrived she ignored me the whole time. Whenever I tried to contribute to the conversation, she would disagree with me in front of everyone. I also caught her in a lie\u2014we had made plans one night. She texted me to cancel bc she wasn\u2019t feeling well. Before I could respond, she texted me again, saying \u201ccan\u2019t wait to see you tonight\u201d which was obviously meant for someone else. She apologized and said she double booked herself, but \u201creally wasn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d I then went \u201cno contact\u201d in Feb 2022. \n\nI missed her terribly, and reached out in April, just a couple months later. She was happy to hear from me, and by May we were now in a committed relationship. Seemingly picking up where we had left off in our last relationship. She said she realized over the last couple of months how much she missed me and how important I was to her. \n\nBy June, we were saying \u201cI love you,\u201d going on weekend trips, and making plans to move in together. Happiest time of my life, until she abruptly ended things after a weekend away with her parents in October. She was distant on the trip, more critical of me than normal (I couldn\u2019t do anything right; making the bed, cooking, she told me I was \u201cannoying\u201d and \u201ccringey\u201d in a certain social situation on that trip. When we got back she told me she loved me less than she did before we left, and thought she wanted to date other people. \n\nI was devastated, again. Despite the breakup, we continued to see each other for dinner\u2014usually at my apartment. I continued with my Herculean efforts\u2014cooking elaborate meals for us, having her favorite wine ready, etc., but no sex and her demeanor towards me was frequently cold. In the beginning of our relationship (both times), I experienced \u201clove bombing\u201d \u2014she would say things like \u201cI hope our kids have your face,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t wait to move in with you,\u201d\u201dI love you,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m crazy about you\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re so important to me.\u201d This love bombing quickly shifted to devaluation (frequent criticism over small things despite my endless efforts to please her, belittling, prioritizing others over me, withholding affection, etc). It went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again, in a matter of months. I was an objectively good boyfriend. I loved her endlessly and passionately, and she was my main priority. \n\nI reached out to her over Christmas, only to be told she\u2019s now in a \u201cserious\u201d relationship and doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel right about seeing each other one-on-one.\u201d I told her I still love her, she simply said that was \u201cproblematic\u201d and she said she wanted me to leave her alone. The wound gets deeper and deeper. \n\nI see their all her family now follow him on social media, which is more than I ever got. He has eclipsed me and I can\u2019t get over it. I feel worthless and the anxiety of them being together and me unable to do anything about it is horrible, unbearable. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long post, and if anyone has any ideas or insights as to her behavior, please share because I\u2019m at a loss and can\u2019t get over it.

Please help!!\n\nIn resume, I had many issues making friends while growing up, specially in high school,now i am at college but i still have the feeling of insecureness attached from my school years,mostly because of things people said about me like: the things i like (music, sports, videogames), the way i dress and my sexual orientation... I met these two friends almost 3 years ago, one of them in college and the other one when I had a job, at the beginning everything was okay but when i told them the things that i was insecure about (like the ones i listed on top) everything became suffocating for me...now that I think clearly. Because of the way i dress and talked about things I like they kind of told me in their own way, that all of those things makes me a lesbian, i know it's not bad but i couldn't help but feel like they were trying to push me into it... i let it slip and i continued telling myself that that is who I am. In high school, i had only been on dates with boys but I never fell in love which is what caused me my confusion... (still kissing them felt nice!).\n A couple of months ago i made a friend on Twitter, she was really nice and we had a lot of things in common,we talked everyday, of course I told my other two friends about the new friend I had...one day it was with them talking and drinking and they saw the messages I had with my friend of Twitter, apparently and according to them, she was interested in me which in my opinion, she was only being nice and that's the vibe i got, i honestly didn't want to read into it that much... they told me that i should try to \"flirt\" with her, at that moment I felt tipsy and agreed, since i don't know much about that, they took my phone and started to message her the majority of things... when the next day arrived and I read the messages again I couldn't help but feel guilty and disgusted with myself because: 1) I didn't want to confuse my friend and 2) I allowed that to happen. \nThat whole day I had anxiety and I felt nauseous, it was kind of like a \"wake up call\" I realized that these 3 years I have been living afraid, way more insecure and confused... and more than ever...forcing things that I feel I am not. Whenever I made a comment about a guy in college that i thought it was handsome one of my friends always made this \"disagreement face\" and in my head it was \"wrong\" to think of boys like that.\n These past few days, I decided to stop talking to them and cut them out. I been feeling more calmed, the anxiety also has been decreasing and i feel better.\nSadly, I had to do that with my Twitter friend also and of course I apologized to her for things getting confusing...she understood everything and we stopped talking a few days ago,I still feel guilty and of course I miss talking to her since she was really nice and respectful but I can't help but feel like the friendship was ruined by them. I deleted my account also since I had the feeling it was consuming me and it was also my mechanism of defense to stop my anxiety.\n\nNow I have to ask: What do I do if these two friends try to get back into my life? How can I set boundaries from manipulative people like them? And what advice could I get from the whole Twitter friend situation? Should I go back to talk to her?\n\nThanks for reading!! I just needed to let it all out.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678645109.0},{"title":"Does she like me or am I overthinking this?

There's that chemistry between us that I've really been looking for, time flies in all of our dates and we're always scheduling the next one right away. I have a really good feeling about her and think I'm starting to really like her.\n\nWe just went on our fourth date last night and she wanted to keep it as a chill hangout where I go over to her place and we just watch some shows, grabs some snacks and play some games, since that's what we're both into. The day was going really well until about 30 minutes into the last game we were playing she was saying she was feeling nauseous and needed to stop. I asked if there was anything I could do to help but she said she just needed to lie down and take a shower. We're also both introverts so I figured I'd ask her if she needed some time alone to rest as she had a busy night out the previous night with friends and she said she did. She gave me a kiss as I left her place, and told me to text her when I got home. I did checked in on how she was doing and she was feeling a lot better after she had thrown up. We then locked down our next date in a couple of days in the evening after she's finished a hangout with her friend.\n\nBut the rest of the night she was a lot colder with me through text. Even when she messaged me this morning it was colder than normal even though she said she was feeling a lot better and slept well. I feel like I know I'm reading too much into this but I've has situations like this in the past where this was the first step towards someone pushing me away. Maybe there's no glaring signs of anything bad happening here and I'm over thinking it all based of some not great past experiences.\n\nI do like this girl and we've both spoken about some bigger life things with each other and some future possibilities and outlooks. Up until last night there was no doubt in my mind that she was all in based on how she was talking. I guess part of me was thinking we were going to move into the next phase of us being intimate with each other as we haven't moved beyond some light kissing. Part of me is wondering if she was expecting me to make a big move last night and when it looked like I wasn't going to that she wanted to bail on the night? I donno. I was wanting to make a move and was planning to later in the hangout when it felt more natural but we never quite got there, and I guess part of me is a little frustrated that I hadn't acted on it sooner -\\_-\n\nAm I reading too much into this? Part of me wants to tell her how I feel about her but a huuuge part of me feels like that's likely moving way too fast. Before she got sick last night I felt like the feeling was super mutual so now I'm questioning a bit, in big part to myself, I know. My plan is to just keep acting as normal, and see how things go on the next date and go from there. But if anyone else has any suggestions that would be greatly appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;dr\\*\\* I'm really hitting it off with this girl that I'm going on dates with but our latest date ended prematurely with her feeling sick and she's been a little distant ever since, even though she's feeling better. I like this girl and up until last night felt like it was very mutual so I'm wondering where to go from here. Keep going as usual and see how it plays out? Pursue her a little more?

He always acts like I\u2019m naive and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for me. He speaks rudely to me and financially controls everything while criticizing any and every purchase I make, even groceries. I\u2019m a stay at home mom and he says all the money is his and the house is his. I get nervous to ask him for basic necessities. Any food or activity choices I make are wrong and I have bad taste. But when I bring this up he tells me of course he loves me and he\u2019s just stressed bc of money. (We\u2019re poor) He even started therapy. But he\u2019s still being mean.   Examples: If I suggest a restaurant he always thinks it\u2019s stupid or gross. If I buy a food I like at the grocery store he thinks he could\u2019ve made a better purchase or I don\u2019t need it and me and the kids need to eat healthier.  If I ask him to grab me a glass of water even after sex it annoys him so much. I feel like I have to be totally independent or he gets annoyed.

Tells me I\u2019m stupid and make bad choices. I\u2019m immature. And lazy. Doesn\u2019t build me up but expects failure.

I'm looking for advice on how to address these emotions and I acknowledge that a lacking relationship with my mom makes my partner's relationship hurt me in ways that it honestly shouldn't. \nI am 23F, he is 25M, we have been dating for 3 years and lived together for 1.5 ish. Recently moved to a new city together. \n\nSETTING: My boyfriend\/domestic partner's mom is in town for 5 days. His dad wasn't in the picture and they are incredibly close. Their personalities are almost exactly alike and they have their own language talking to each other. It's amazing, frankly. I'm the oops baby and 4th child of my parents who are older than BFs grandparents. We aren't close. \n\nBACKGROUND\/ CAN SKIP: My partner is not very affectionate. He doesn't have a love language that he knows of. I received love through physical touch and I've learned that he has a \"battery\" or sorts where I can only hug him a certain number of times per day and honestly hold his attention for a certain amount of time. He is not interested in most of the things I am (like plants, books, art, outdoors, motorcycling...) But he listens and we do have areas where we connect like anime. \n\nEXAMPLE: This has been happening the whole trip but I will use yesterday night as an example. He announced to me that they were going out for oysters as an appetizer to the dinner we had planned. I was cool with that and said let me know when you want to pick me up for dinner. He informed me they decided to stay at the oyster place for dinner. They were gone for 5 hours. I went and got dinner myself and I told myself I was cool with it. They come back and are jolly. They ignore me and talk to each other about how fun their night was and saying how crazy it is that people come up to them and tell them it looks like they are having fun. Every time I asked how was the food, or asked for details on their story, they would turn to me like I disturbed them. I'm sure they didn't mean that. They just didn't want to pause their jovialness to include me in it. I realized this and said I was tired and went to bed. \nPartner came in for bed and I was clearly still awake. He just started watching a show on his phone and just said gave me one word answers when I asked him how his day was. So he's tired, that's okay. This morning, we woke up and he immediately went out to the living room where his mom is sleeping and started talking to her again. \n\nSUMMARY: Like, it's fine. They're close and that's lovely. They travel to see each other every month to two months. That's great. But why does it feel like I completely lose my partner when she's here? I get 0 affection and he completely changes when he's with her. They have references I don't understand at all. We will be talking for 10 minutes about something serious and I find out they they've been joking the whole time. He initiates hugs with her which he acts like are a chore with me. I am more upbeat than they are and they look at me as if I'm annoying. \nI know it's not about me. Of course it's not. If I could have a relationship with my mom like that I would love it and treasure it. But how am I supposed to feel when my partner just takes a vacation from me while I am sleeping right next to him? When he's visiting her I get maybe one or two texts a day. That's fine! Visit with your mom! But when it's in my house and I feel like I'm invading on every conversation had at my own dinner table? I completely lose my partner and he acts in a way where I feel like I don't know him at all? How do it deal with this? \n\n\nTL;DR: my parenter changes when his mom is staying with us and they exclude me from meals, conversations and activities we have planned to do together.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678644329.0},{"title":"How can i (f20)ask my boyfriend (m20) to stop liking pictures of girls he used to hookup with, without sounding controlling","author":"i6m6b","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11pf8r3\/how_can_i_f20ask_my_boyfriend_m20_to_stop_liking\/","text":"My boyfriend(m20) and i (f20) have been dating for 2.5 years.

I usually cook meals and do housework and I quite enjoy doing them as long as it was for us (or for A). Last year, due to some housing issues we had to move to a new temporary place and there met with a new soon-to-be roommate (B, F 28y) who also happens to be looking for a new place to live. We had an agreement and rented a house for the three of us since this day.   \n\n\nWe're on very good terms and don't conflict much in personalities or ideologies, jokes are made left to right and we hang out in the house regularly with only one slight divination in hobbies. (A) and I are hardcore indoor introverts, practically every hobby we have are indoor specific while (B) is a very outgoing type of person and tends to drag us out if possible. Things were going quite smoothly at first and nothing seems to be going south, but at some point, it starts to feel kinda off.  \n\n\nAs I mentioned before, I am heavily attached to (A) and tend to agree with (A)'s decisions. Sometimes when suggestions were brought up from both (A) and (B) I would go for the prior one. And this seems to be a huge issue with (B). Also, when (B) wants to go out while (A) wasn't able to, I would also choose not to go out with (B) alone. It happened a few times and then I started to notice a pattern: (B) would ask me first if I wanted to go out with (B), and since I don't really want to go out that much in the first place plus I am not sure if (A) is coming with or not, I would delay the answer or simply say maybe. Then (B) would go ask (A) to hangout outside and since (A) is kinda socially awkward and does not want to offend people in the slightest, would usually say yes or get peer pressured into going out, and since (A) is going out, I usually want to tag along which results in a 1-day could shoulder from (B) where (B) wouldn't talk to me or simply brush me away with words like *\"whatever\"* or *\"do as you want\"*.\n\n I know the reason that caused (B)'s upset was that I didn't want to go out at first but when (A) would go out I would change my mind, and because I know it was my action of changing minds to agree with (A), (B) was upset about it, so I would usually play it cool and go confront the situation and try easing out the tension between us as I don't want the bad air to ruin the relatively good atmosphere we usually have in the house. Things usually get resolved and we hang out in the house like normal, cracking jokes and messing with each other. Where I think the conflict was resolved, (B) has been holding grudges the whole time.  \n\n\nThings like this continued to happen and (B) started to call me \"double standard\". I have mentioned to (B) before that (A) and I are like a bundle sale where I'm the giveaway item that comes with the main and you don't need to pay much attention as long as I'm with (A). These types of events or similar occasions start happening more and more frequently to the point where I am not able to hang out with (A) as regularly as used to because (B) would stay in the same common room with (A) and I do not wish to confront (B).   \n\n\nYesterday was the day when we had an intervention between (B) and me. We explained both of our perspectives and (B) told me that (B) felt that I wasn't seeing (B) as a friend and listed out every single occasion where I would change my mind to agree with (A) not (B). I explained that I do see (B) as a friend but not to the extent of (A) since we've known each other for so long plus we're both indoor people and share practically the same hobbies and interests. I also explained that I have mental issues where I tend to be attached to the person I feel comfortable with and that I have absolutely no ill intentions toward (B) which made (B) cry a lot and made me feel like an asshole.  \n\n\nTl;dr: I pay way more attention to my 7-year-long friend than my 2-year roommate causing awkward situations and don't know how to maintain this relationship.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678628338.0},{"title":"Beyond confused when it comes to my (M22) current situationship (F21)","author":"Forsaken-Fisherman-2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11penkx\/beyond_confused_when_it_comes_to_my_m22_current\/","text":"We dated a few years ago when we were younger and it was incredibly intense.

The issues didn\u2019t happen very often but when they did happen, we could always communicate and they were very good to work with my moods. \n\nWe got our first place together (first apartment for the both of us ever)\u2014and made a joint savings account, we\u2019ve saved for stuff like being able to get our cars fixed and just general adult things neither of us had really done before. We built a life together, they love my cat, I felt like I had it really good for a bit. \n\nFairly recently, things have started to go downhill. It started with them getting angry at little things. Like road rage or me asking them to pick up their trash. I don\u2019t do well with anger, I get legitimately scared when someone raises their voice or throws things around and I\u2019ve told them that. The outbursts haven\u2019t been happening as often as they were, but still sometimes. \n\nI then noticed they didn\u2019t want to do anything anymore. No more going out to dinner, no dates, none of the things we would do together (pool, longboarding, make music etc). We used to have friends come over on Fridays and they cancelled those and also quit the billiards team. \n\nThey started to get very distant. They started to only send one word replies, not really talk to me at home\u2014they just want to play video games. They had told me in the past, their lowest point when they were super depressed was when they did nothing but play video games. \n\nI am aware that they are depressed. I have tried to talk to them about things, but it turns into a fight. They say their pushing me away so they don\u2019t hurt me because that\u2019s all they think they\u2019re good for. They say they don\u2019t know what they want or who they are and that they\u2019re just angry and miserable. They\u2019ll have moments of happy and apologize for how terrible they\u2019ve been and then go right back to being cold to me. The only time I see them act happy is with their best friend. I asked why they can have fun with their friend but not with me, and they couldn\u2019t really give me a good answer. That I get the worst of it because we\u2019re together all the time (studio apartment with no privacy).\n\nThey act like they want nothing to do with me. Like actively hating me\u2014I can tell when I touch them they don\u2019t wanna be touched by me, when I say I love you it\u2019s too annoying for them to say it back with any real meaning (unless they have the moment where they come back to their senses and are very regretful).\n\nThey have said when things get hard someone leaves them or they leave. I told them I want to work on this together because they were there for me when I was low. But I just can\u2019t handle feeling like everything is my fault and that I\u2019m having to beg for love, which I\u2019ve only done one other time and it sent me to the mental hospital. I have tried doing all the chores so they have nothing to do, I\u2019ve tried to give space, I\u2019ve tried to talk, I\u2019m at a loss. They act like they really don\u2019t wanna be with me but then tell me that they love me.\n\nThey just signed up for their work health insurance and they\u2019re going to see a therapist, but that could be months. \n\nAt the moment, I have a time limit. If nothing has changed by summer time, I guess I\u2019m gone.

I was raised to get a job as soon as I am done studying so that I can not only earn money but pay bills.

Once she puts her mind on something she really works well and it is inspiring to me at how driven she is in this regard. My comment on her finding a job backfired, she took it that I thought she is lazy and a bum because she is not employed yet even-though she has been looking around.\n\nShe now sees herself as being inferior to me despite me telling her otherwise, she is just not listening to me. It has gotten to the point where she wants to break up because she believes that since I am employed, I no longer want to support her in her dreams and aspirations.

To me it feels like she has jumped to her own conclusion of it and now won't see past it, it's like she believes she is inferior and is now reiterating it to me, even-though that is false.

I reciprocated the gaze, which was sometimes prolonged. Before that moment, we hardly ever talked, but one of those days she got up and asked me a completely random and disconnected question. This left me stunned and from that moment on, the situation between us two only got better. We didn't write to each other on social media, I would occasionally send her something and she reacted positively. I found out that we have a lot in common in terms of musical tastes, etc... However, the situation has evolved negatively.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that no one had ever shown such an interest in me before, I was happy and took advantage of it to ask her out. She told me she would feel embarrassed and that we would instead meet at the home of a mutual friend over the weekend. My response was positive, I told her it was okay. The fact is that from that moment on (about 3 weeks ago) she started completely ignoring me in class and it made me feel pretty bad. Only one day everything was as before, but then the thing vanished, it was a special day, I don't know.\n\nThis week, that friend I mentioned before had their birthday and next week she'll have hers. I bought a gift for both of them and I want to give it to them next weekend. I also want to write a small letter to her in which I might clarify my position and apologize if I have caused her any discomfort.

It was my first serious relationships and it was very teenager-ish but fun and loving. We were both in college, life was good and we were dumb & young.\nI have to say, that relationship itself had potential but i was very cold and couldn\u2019t give 100% commitment and he desperately needed love and affection all the time. Like i had to prove my love to him: always call, text, saying cute things and i was in my \u201cnot like other girls\u201d phase so we were arguing all the time. He was very dramatic and hysterical even. He yelled often and got into drama queen mood. I hated it. I thought that relationships should feel easy and not dramatic. I should be laughing and not crying. He loved calling me cold. We broke up every year and got together every spring on his birthday:) \nI had other guys and every time i chose to start again with my ex. It was like coming back to your home place where everything is known and no surprises waiting for you. \nLast april everything started as usual: i wished him a happy birthday and we started talking again. I was 100% sure that we will be back together. He drove to my house, we spoke all night, i felt like talking to an old friend and it was so refreshing. At one point he told me that he\u2019s moving to Israel. It was a shocker. I laughed it off but it was definitely a sad news. So i decided to get into \u201cfemme fatale\u201d mood and have a short last time fling so that he will be thinking about me while living his new life.\nWe decided to rent a flat for a few days and have there our late birthday celebration like in good ole days. We booked a flat, paid and 8 hours before i got a call from him. He sounded very guilty and so frustrated and he said \u201cI don\u2019t wanna lie to you but i have a crush on another girl and i wanna be faithful to her\u201d. It DESTROYED me. For context: this man has been my loyal dog . During our \u201cbreak ups\u201d he never had anyone. One time he went on a tinder date and got one night stand that was \u201cso bad that i want to forget\u201d. I knew always that i\u2019m his main ex and he will always love me. And no one else. And hearing about him having a crush so serious that he doesn\u2019t even wanna sleep with me \u2013 was a disaster. I was very sad, angry and mentally unstable because it felt like betrayal. While he was sitting in a car all night talking to me he already was talking to this new girl. I got into my crazy mode.  I also was graduating from college and stress was doubled = next day started with me having a MASSIVE mental break down that i never had in my life before or during over relationship. I called him crying and looking for closure. I was hysterical and he came to my place. He was very distant, cold and even arrogant because he loved seeing me so desperate for his love since he never got to se me so vulnerable in our relationship.\nWe cuddled and then had sex. I was happy and he was still cold. And at that point i realized that it doesn\u2019t work anymore. He doesn\u2019t want me like he always used to. \nMy mental health got worse. I texted him every day, tried seeing him and was VERY desperate to prove to myself that i\u2019m still loved. \nOne day we met at a park and i burst into tears in his arms and he told me the WORST thing that he could: \u201cNow i feel the same love for you for someone else\u201d. \nThat was our last conversation. It took a toll on my mental and physical state. Probably because we never fully broke up and moved on and he was the first one to do so and not me. I got some health problems from a stress. It was like a delayed post break up stress. \nHe moved to Israel with her since she\u2019s jewish. 6 months later they broke up and she came back and he stayed with his family. A week ago i got a video call from him and we talked like nothing happened. He told me about his life there. It was SO random that i couldn\u2019t even talk properly. He even briefly talked about us getting \u201cfake\u201d marriage so i could get a passport and live there. It was weird. And i was left confused. After that call we didn\u2019t talk and i don\u2019t know if we will. \nBUT my question is\u2013 why does it all mean and how i can move on and leave him behind without coming back in any form? \n\nT.L;DR: my ex of 5 years who we had the best\/worst first love type relationship came back into my life by randomly calling even tho he lives in another country and had a failed relationship with his new girl that lasted 5 months","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678638079.0},{"title":"How do I (F23) leave him when he (M25) keeps giving me false hope?","author":"ThrowRA667771","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11pdi0x\/how_do_i_f23_leave_him_when_he_m25_keeps_giving\/","text":"I see potential in him, but that's just it- potential.

We met on a dating app, and it was just chit chatting and having normal conversations. We got along pretty well, I'm not gonna lie. Back then, he was in a really bad place due to some personal issues regarding jobs and what not, so I suggested he starts looking for  a job and, you know, work on that bad mental health place, you know how it goes. \n\nBefore we started dating, we lived in different cities. \n\nNow, we're in the same industry,  and it's basically live sound industry,  jumping around and doing big events, concerts, and the list goes on, so with the experience he has, it wasn't a hard task to find a well paid job.   We now work for the same company.  Due to the nature of our job, it is sometimes hard to maintain a relationship, but he decided to move from a different city to mine, start working here, and we'll, start dating me. \nAt a time, I decided to maybe put my job aside and have some personal life, some fun, something other than dying at work because I absolutely adore it.\n\nIt's becoming a nightmare,  and I don't know what to do. I don't feel like this is right for me, and I will give you a list of things or certain situations that happened,  so please do let me know about your opinion.  And before I start, I know he's way older than me. I just had a really bad experience with people my age, and I figured this might be a better option. \n\nThe list:\n\n1. I personally believe he moved here too early. It wasn't even a month.\n\n2. Whenever we argue,  he yells and hits things, even though I said that's something I hate and will not he tolerating \n\n3. It turns out I'm the one who never has any tolerance for anything, and I'm always guilty of something\n\n4. He never listens to me, and every single time I say something bothers me, he just dismisses it, doesn't pay attention, and his favourite thing  to do is to reverse the situation and starts going on about how I'm not perfect either, and all the things I do or I did to him\n\n5. Every time I have to cancel our plans due to my university ( I do two masters and have a full-time job), it's chaos.  He starts yelling, whining,crying, throwing up or whatever to show what a piece of shit I am, and how that's affecting him\n\n6. He wants to spend every waking moment with me. Thank god my friends are good people, and understand, but I feel extremely guilty for just..ignoring them.\n\n7. He checks my phone ( instagram, WhatsApp, Galery, calls, messages) because he used to get cheated on, and I'm not okay with this at all.\n\n8. I used to be in a lot of physically abusive relationships,  and he thinks it's funny to purposely make me flinch. \n\n9. Valentines Day and Women's Day we spent arguing. He wasn't bothered to get me a chocolate bar, let alone anything bigger. Didn't even send a message.\n\n10. Every time I tried talking to him about issues, everything he said was basically, \" Every day there's something affecting you. You're really supposed to visit a psychologist. \" \n\nNow, on top of that, when I was on the edge of ending my life, he offered me to suck his d***, because that's gonna make me feel better.  Not to mention, I was  crying,  and originally didn't want to see him that day because I knew sex was all he wanted. \nWhen I don't want to hang out,  he says he'll stop by anyway. \n\nI don't know what to do, and I don't know how to leave. I feel extremely guilty , I know he'll come around, and we also work at the same company.  He gets aggressive and easily mad, and I just, don't know how to proceed.  He wants to move in, and I want to get the he'll out of this relationship. \n\nAm I in the wrong?

When they become good friends, I felt like I lost one of my emotional supports outside of my relationship, and I don't know how to accept the inevitable shift in my friendship or in my relationship.** \n\nTo start with, this post isn't about cheating, suspicions on cheating, etc. \n\nI recently graduated and moved to a different city for my master's program where my boyfriend will join me after finishing his undergrad in May. Practically all of our friends graduated with me except for maybe two people who still had a year to go. \n\nMy boyfriend (I'll call him John) and I are both introverted people who have trouble putting ourselves out there, and I already knew when we started dating a year ago that we would have shared friends because we already had those people in common *before* we started dating. As I mentioned, though, the shared friends that we had also moved away. \n\nHe was feeling lonely, so I asked him why he didn't try hanging out with a close friend of mine (I'll call her Mary). John said he didn't like Mary as a person very much and that he wasn't really interested in spending time with her, so I didn't think too much into it after that. But then they did start hanging out more, not in groups but one-on-one and I remember feeling irritated by it. \n\nThey would get coffee together, have a drink after studying, get brunch, see movies together, and I trust them both completely and I know that John's been lonely, so I didn't really say anything because I want him to have a support network too, plus, I didn't know how to explain what I was feeling other than insecurity, but I felt like that wasn't quite it either.\n\nA couple weeks ago, John did say something that kind of made me really upset though. We were on the phone while he was at a bar with Mary and our other friends, and I got agitated because he kept taking a long time to respond because he was laughing with the other girls and he made a ridiculous joke about being married to Mary for 25 years, and then I felt actual insecurity kick in. After we had a lengthy discussion about how that hurt me, we were about to put the conversation to rest whenever he said something along the lines of: \"I just won't be friends with her anymore then, but I need to tell her about this discussion to tell her why\". When I asked him not to, because I'm not ready to have that kind of discussion with Mary and to explain my insecurities to her, he was upset because he thought I was trying to \"control the narrative\". I was also kind of upset because I never told John that he had to stop being friends with her, but that I just wanted him to be mindful of my feelings, and now if they end their friendship, my friendship with her will also inevitably change.\n\nBut then, I had a realization that my friendship with Mary *already has* changed as a result of her newfound closeness with John. I can't go to her with relationship problems anymore because she'll be caught in the middle which is unfair to her, and I can't disclose anything about my problems with John that would be compromising to their friendship because it would be unfair to him. \n\nBasically, Mary used to be an emotional safe space for me where I felt like I could tell her anything and we could discuss anything, and now I'm sort of mourning what our friendship used to be, because now I have to share my emotional space with John, who obviously is close enough friends with her that he cares about her and feels that he has an emotional obligation to her should anything change. \n\nI shared my feelings with him and tried to make it clear that I don't blame him for my friendship having to change, but that I am mourning it and that it may be a reason why I seem off when they hang out together in more personal settings. And then he said that he didn't mean for a friendship with her to happen, and then I got even more upset because he obviously did when he invited her out for coffee and made time for her. He keeps saying that desire to become friends was unintentional, but I genuinely don't really know what he expected would have happened when he kept meeting up with her. If he would have just said \"I'm sorry that your relationship changed as a result of my emotional friendship\", that would have been fine, but I feel almost resentful that he's making it seem like this random thing that just happened. \n\nI don't know if it's possible to reconcile my friendship with Mary, or even how to sort out how I'm feeling about John's reaction to any of this right now. Any external perspectives that can help me process this situation would be much appreciated","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678616354.0},{"title":"What does he want?","author":"Cautious-Syrup-3881","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11p5zp0\/what_does_he_want\/","text":" Hi everyone. 35 F here.

I receive the we should just be coparents chat and overtime i was overcoming with depression. Her reason was she said she felt she rushed into things and now she wants to just be alone for a while. Meanwhile im here sweating bullets because of becoming a single dad to 2 kids that i wanted more than anything to dedicate my life too. In time i come to terms with this. Well now fast forward to now. I just out of she got into a relationship with her best friend and she never intended to find out. i found out when someone sent me a screenshot with her bio stating she found true love (not in those words but same difference). Ive never felt more used in my life and now im sitting here trying to cope by lifting weights and smoking pot. But right now i feel numb to the core.

Not even allowing my son in her to be named a sliver out of me. I feel i just need to cut my losses. I dont care if i have to pay Childsupport. I feel ive been taken advantage of and i have no friends to vent to. No legal advice to fall back on. Nothing but this. Im desperate but even now.

I took care of her when she was violently sick, I went to her appointments, I never said no to her requests and pampered her to the best of my ability. And it feels just a stab in the back to be treated just like I dont matter. That she can have the kids and I have work just to see them. That what was suppose to rekindle our relationship as torn mental and emotional scars too deep i feel therapy isnt a option anymore. Course I dont think about ending it, A life better lived is the sweetest revenge. But at this point I dont know what to do. Do i take the chances and cut this from my life for good, I hurt my daughter, my unborn son, the women i loved and still somehow still care for, But im miserable and i can not continue living like this while im here breaking down one day at a time that i know for sure one day i just drive off in one direction and close my eyes. I cant forgive myself for what id do to my kids but i rather they know their dad be out their alive somewhere than a plot of soil they can see when they want too. \n\nOr do I cut it out before it spreads. Do i leave this and start something new. I know i will not be the same if I do. Every day im not with my daughter feels like im drowning but ive tried to express this to myself that its just a break and that eventually i can be with my daughter and son every day. day and night. I know this sounds extremely selfish but i wasnt the one that wanted to leave. I devoted my life to someone and in turn i devoted my life to my kids. But im not blind I see the writings on the walls.

And he did. I was often annoyed with both of them. She didn't work due to her medical issues but she was a shopaholic and a hoarder, and they were in serious debt (often he would need to borrow money to make it through the end of the month).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, after our dad died, he did step up more in helping deal with cleaning out dad's house, etc. And then unexpectedly Denise died 8 weeks ago which came as a total shock. My brother was grieving deeply and I went to stay with him for a bit and help him get things in order (we barely put a dent in things....I was pretty shocked at what chaos his life was in).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the part I'm struggling with: within WEEKS (I'm not exaggerating) he has told me he met another woman. It's just online so far, but they talk for hours over video every night, and they are going to meet up next weekend (for the entire weekend). Denise (his \"soulmate\") died 8 weeks ago. And not after a lengthy illness....just out of the blue. And 3 weeks later he was spending hours every day talking to another woman. He's told me they average about 4 - 6 hours of talking a day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have tried many times to talk to him. To tell him to please give himself room to grieve. To seek counselling to deal with this loss. To take things slowly. He just is adamant that it is \"destiny\" that brought this woman to him in his hour of need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really concerned about him. He won't stop talking about this woman (it's \"Lisa this\" and \"Lisa that\"). And he has a 12 year old daughter from a previous relationship who he has 1\/2 custody of, and he told me that he plans on having her meet this new woman very soon. And when his daughter is with him, he's spending hours talking to Lisa on the phone or online. And I'm really doubting Lisa can be \"normal\" given that she knows Denise died just shy of 2 months ago. She can't be wanting him for money or anything (he definitely doesn't have much of that) so I can't figure out where the scam could be. She has a job and she is a citizen of our country. I'm really confused by it all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it normal to move on this quickly? Doesn't it seem insanely fast? Denise's stuff is still everywhere in the house and he thinks this new woman is going to just come on over and meet his poor daughter. Extended family members keep reaching out to me to check in on him (since Denise just died) thinking he must be in deep grief, but meantime he's fully infatuated with some woman he's never met in person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there any possibility this could be \"ok\"? Is there any possibility Lisa might actually be a normal person and they could work out? Or am I correct in thinking this has disaster written all over it??\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: my brother isn't properly grieving his wife and has immediately jumped into a weird new relationship","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678589396.0},{"title":"My (18f) boyfriend(27m) has just accused me of cheated and broken up with me","author":"throwrahewrtbreak","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11pdh76\/my_18f_boyfriend27m_has_just_accused_me_of\/","text":"Tldr; I was snapping (no context just Snapchat pictures of walls) this guy I flirted with at a party before we got together.

There is a group of friends I have at work who I hangout with sometimes after work. He is included in this group now and usually goes. He likes to flirt and has hit on me several times. I shut it down when he takes it too far. When we are at friend's houses he always wants to talk to me, sit next to me, touch me in 'joking' ways except when my bf is there of course. Someone gave him my number, or he may have gotten it from work somehow. He texts me every once in a while. Unless he asks me a specific question about something I ignore him. It is annoying sometimes but is not frequent. I have talked to my boyfriend about this. He will get upset about it sometimes but he never acts like that when bf is around.

He was sitting directly across from me. A guy we work with walked in and he had his hand on my leg. I didn't think much of this at the time because it wasn't that unusual. He would do something like this and I would tell him to stop, he would laugh about it and apologize. This has turned into a huge rumor at work that we are sleeping together.

We are having some issues with communication. It is a very stressful time in her life, and she barely communicates with me. I tried openly communicating my issue with this with her, and though we did seem to come to an agreement that she will try more, every time I raised this topic she threw my behavior of the past in my face: I had a very stressful time last year, and was constantly tired, eventually also getting COVID and having long-COVID symptoms for 2 months \u2013 basically I was not my full self for \\~4 months, partly because of my own choices of taking on too much work, partly because of no fault of my own (COVID). We talked a lot about it back then because this made her quite unhappy (having to spend time with exhausted me, never getting energized me), but she really tried her best when I was sick and I promised her to have more time and energy after the temporary stay abroad.\n\nStill I find it hard not to interpret her lack of communication as a lack of interest, though she tells me that she would rather only talk to me when she has the energy instead of trying to squeeze me in somewhere in her busy schedule. She directly relates this to my behavior last year: That she was unhappy when I tried to spend time with her even though I didn't have the energy, and that she doesn't want to do the same to me. For me it seems that this leads to us not talking at all, since she never actually finds any time, and thus I feel lonely in the relationship. She also says that she does not want to show me her negative emotions, and this I find crazy considering that we have been together for 4 years and I've seen her at her lows and she has seen me at mine. Part of me also worries that she does not want to talk to me because she sees me as another potential stressor; and since most of our longer conversations lately have been about this communication issue, it might not be too far fetched.\n\nI am also wondering whether this 'you did this to me, so I have the right to do this to you'-thinking is healthy, or if it is a precursor to resentment.

I have a mediocre job making enough to get by (no degree).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm very far from a gold-digger (I'm actually pretty minimalistic and low maintenance). But for the first few years, he had lots of money and he's a spender. He always wanted to go out to eat or on vacations and since we were partners he wanted me to come with him, so he'd pay. For my part I helped him as much as I could around his house, etc. He's always been very bad with money (no savings, rents a big fancy condo, leases an expensive car, etc). I am good with money and have tried over the years to help but he doesn't ever listen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year he decided he wanted to go back to school for a different degree (it will complement his current degree, but it wasn't \"necessary\"). I tried to suggest that he wait...that he save up money for tuition. That he have an emergency fund. Etc. He was adamant he was going to do it and that it would be very beneficial and that he didn't want to wait...he tends to be kind of impulsive. So he was determined to work and go to school, but that didn't work out. There just wasn't enough time, so now he doesn't have a job. He manages to scrape together enough by borrowing money from his parents and relatives, but it's definitely not enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've helped him a lot. I've lent him thousands and I've bought him groceries, etc. He got rid of the fancy car but he still rents the condo (for now).

We had some arguments over small issues which turned into major fights. We could always overcome them eventually with reflective communication. She is mostly rational while I\u2019m emotional. When I need to cry, I cry even if there are people around. When I laugh, I do it wholeheartedly. I believe in self-expression and assertive communication.

She hardly shares her emotions, but when she can, she would share her deepest thoughts and we would have wonderful and meaningful conversations.\n\nTwo weeks ago I left my job and it affected me tremendously since I was working with toddlers 8 hours a day and we all formed strong connections.

She tried to calm me and left after some minutes. Then my partner looked at me and said she has never felt this ashamed in her life before. I told her my mom was just worried because previously I had similar panic attacks in my adolescent years but she said it was over as soon as my mom stepped into my room. I was dumbfounded.

For context, I've been seeing my bf for about 3 months now, in a relationship officially for a month. We live about 2 hours from each other. We're both in Australia so days may be a bit off for some.\n\nMe and my bf have a routine of me visiting him one weekend and him visiting the next. Everytime I go to visit him, it goes fine, but everything he's supposed to come see me, there's an excuse. He slept in too late, he didn't sleep at all, he feels sick, it's too hot etc. He ends up cancelling last minute after I've cleaned the whole house but always reschedules for the next day and does come over.\n\nThis weekend, I was meant to go see him on Saturday, but he cancelled Friday night because he wanted time alone to rest and recharge his social battery after a long work week. I was fine with that and he rescheduled for Sunday (today.) Then at 5pm on Saturday, he messaged me to say he was going to a party. I was a bit upset because I mean, if your social battery is so drained, why go to a very social place?\n\nAnyway I wasn't too bothered until this morning when I was half way there into a two hours trip and he cancelled. He told me he was too hungover. He promised me last night he would see me today. I got ready and woke up early because we agreed to meet in the morning.\n\nHe gets sick a lot which he can't help, but I also get sick a lot as a chronic migraine sufferer and I still message AS SOON as I feel sick, not last minute.

Even if he reschedules and what not, he always confirms it the night before and then ends up cancelling last minute.

It's interesting because my last relationship, we could talk for 10+ hours about anything and everything over the phone\/video chat and I absolutely know and recognize that every relationship is different, but I can't help but wish we had that. Those endless conversations about everything, talking nonsense, asking the strangest questions...we don't have that. mind you, I'm not comparing this relationship to that one-- my current partner and ex are two vastly different people.

And I feel like I've been the one to initiate things, walking up to her to hold her just because, or trying to have passionate moments with her where we just kiss and make out and such. I've even initiated having showers with her so that we can be more intimate and close.\n\nI think we've only had sex a total of 4-5 times and again, I've always been the one to initiate it.\n\nShe's told me before that she's not a very touchy-feely person and I absolutely understand and respect that but gods I am so touch-starved...It feels like I'm trying to meet her needs without mine being met? I don't know...\n\nI don't know if she's waiting for me to do something or say something but I would like for her to....idk just reach out and touch me?

We hang out a lot because we vibe good and have the same sense of humor, as well as enjoy the same games together. However, the past 2-3 years we have felt they have become extremely annoying and unbearable at times. \n\nWe hung out with them tonight and I think we are both at that point that we don\u2019t know if we want to hang out with them anymore, however we want to make sure we aren\u2019t the assholes here.  We have noticed things recently in their marriage that seem really unhealthy and weird. I know we don\u2019t know their marriage, but these just seem really weird to us. One major thing we feel is that her husband it seems is always trying to impress her and he baby talks to her a lot. For example, we were playing a game today and every time he did something he would go \u201cdid you see that baby???\u201d And she has to say something like reinforcement to him for him to shut up and stop saying that, like dude you\u2019re in your 30s. And he always make anything about something she enjoys even if it has nothing to do with it. Like if I bring something up he will be like oh just like this and it\u2019s something she likes like her dog and it doesn\u2019t even make sense that he brought it up. Another thing is he can\u2019t ever just let her be and do something for herself. If my husband is driving or I am driving, her husband will go around to the car door she is at and open it for her, even if it is blocking someone from getting into the passenger side or taking forever. I get opening the door sometimes, my husband does it for me but every single time? Is that really necessary? It\u2019s been so bad he will practically push my husband out of the way so he can get to a door first. And another example is today someone asked her to take a picture of them so she said of course and my husband was showing him something and the second she stepped maybe 2 feet away to take the picture he left my husband and went by her to watch her and then hold her hand back 2 feet back so my husband could continue explaining. I mean why couldn\u2019t he just let her take the picture and come back? Why does he have to hold her hand the entire time we are out? Even if they are eating. It\u2019s made my husband and I wonder if we are jealous or if we are doing something wrong in our marriage and literally have us wondering if we are being judgmental assholes or if they are overcompensating for something? \n\nHe tends to only focus on her and will do anything to impress her or make her \u201chappy\u201d. We were playing a game that we all play against each other but can help one another and he needed help so my husband offered to help and he said ok and then looked at her stuff and said actually she asked first so she\u2019s going to help me. Even though she didn\u2019t ask at all and I don\u2019t think she wanted to help. We have brought it up before with them and nothing seems to change. We want to bring it up again but first want to make sure we aren\u2019t crazy people. I mean if we are being jerks please tell us.

I feel like holidaying vs living are very different. He would be a foreigner in my country, but I will to the best of my ability help him get on his feet. This would include work, networking, anything he needs really. I work in an office full time whereas he does casual work, and because he doesn\u2019t have any qualifications (education), I know it would be a challenge for him to get a job.

He feels pressured and told me that I\u2019m not giving him any options as our \u201chappy medium\u201d. He feels that I make it sound like packing your bag and go is an easy thing to do. I know it\u2019s not, but every single discussion we have turns into an argument.\n\nI understand I\u2019m not really giving him any other options and that I am being very selfish now, but the last thing I want is to separate from him because I love him so much and I feel that this is a cause worth fighting for.\n\nWe have considered Bali as our happy medium that might be come accommodating to him (lots of expats etc) but unfortunately even with that option, he is still very reluctant. The house in Australia will still be available for us to come back to if it does not work out. He does want our daughter to go to school here, which I am fine with.

I have known all of them since the 7th grade. My relationship with my friends was phenomenal. I remember when me Jack, John and James would all hop in a discord call and talk about pop culture, video games and other things that would strike our interest. While there was some arguing we never meant to hurt each other with our words. This has changed in the past year and a half or so. My friend Jack started using racial slurs. Whenever I would confront him about his vulgar language he would call me a f*ggot or a n*gger. \n\nThis seemed incredibly out of character for Jack. Whilst I don\u2019t care for his use of the English language I still cared about him deeply. I have spent so much time with him and I frankly couldn\u2019t imagine cutting him out of my life. He was the only person who would make me laugh when all I could do was cry. He brought joy into my life when I most needed it and I am so thankful that he brought that light into my life. Because of the positive impact he put upon my life I dealt with it. I stayed silent when he would insult me. Or insult others. After all I thought it was the banter that we would all partake in occasionally. But it would seem that this behavior of his would get worse. Much much worse. \n\nJack started making fun of everything that I like. If I said that I liked Valorant he would make fun of me for liking it. If I said that I liked to play poker he would make fun of me. And while this isn\u2019t a big deal it is hard to be constantly criticized for stupid things that don\u2019t really matter. This was about the time when John started joining in on making fun of me. This especially hurt because I really trusted John. I told him things that my parents never even knew about. And when he eventually started using my secrets against me was when I started to separate from the friend group. \n\nI spent some time reflecting on my relationship with Jack and John . And I decided that it was still worth pursuing despite all of the challenges. However when I returned things had gotten even worse.\n\nJack started talking about how much he hated Jewish people. He would talk about killing \u201cevery hook nosed jew I see\u201d. He would call people of color \u201cmonkeys\u201d. He would call my mother and sisters \u201cw*ores\u201d\n\nI feel so conflicted. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I want our relationship to be how it was before. The things that they are saying makes me want to slap them across the face.

At some point he got suspended defending me from a creep so my parents came to find out about my interaction with him. I felt guilty but at this point I was attached so I went behind their backs to continue talking with him (we had to stop meeting up though).

We've been together for 4 years and he's literally always done this. We've talked about it many many times but it seems like he truly can't stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll give the latest example. This morning I told him about a couple of MINOR issues I was having (one with my mom, one at work). Both minor issues. We talked about it, he gave me his opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater we went shopping and his bank card was locked because he apparently entered the pin incorrectly. I told him, no problem...let's just call the bank and they'll reset it (he's done this before). While waiting on hold on the phone he's having his usual stress meltdown. Muttering, swearing. I'm used to this and I felt a bit of anxiety because I KNEW what he would start doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe started telling me that I'm totally wrong about everything. That my thoughts about the issues with work and my mom are TOTALLY WRONG. I told him that's fine, they were just minor issues and I didn't really have any firm thoughts about them anyway. But he just kept arguing that I was WRONG in my thinking. Then immediately jumped to asking me if I did X, Y and Z that he had asked me to do. He literally just asked me to do these things this morning so no, I hadn't gotten to them yet. So then he starts going on about how he needs someone who will help him, act as a team, blah blah blah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realize he's ONLY doing this because he's stressed in the moment. And he truly doesn't seem to be able to control it. He gets so stressed over the most minor things that are easy to fix, and he lashes out at me over anything he can dredge up in that moment. As soon as the issue is fixed (in this case they reset his pin) he's back to normal and being loving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I find it to be a total turnoff. In fact I've found myself becoming less attracted to him because one of my hacks is to try to view him as a scared little boy having a tantrum when he starts this shit (to avoid getting mad at him and arguing and trying to defend myself over nonsense) but that's backfiring into me viewing him that way all the time. Which isn't sexy LOL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo we need therapy? Does HE need solo therapy?

I noticed we had the same area code which is super weird since I was raised in a very small area super far away. Apparently she grew up in a small town about an hour from me and we are basically the exact same age(only 12 days apart) and I thought that was super cool. It was February 14th so I asked if she had any plans for Valentine\u2019s Day and she said she was free, so I called a lot of places in the area to book a last minute reservation and managed to find 1 place for dinner. It was the first time I was super excited to go on a date in years and I think I came off as nervous. I drove her back home and she said she had a great time and wanted to see me again!\n\nI told her that I had friends coming in town for the following 2 weeks and wouldn\u2019t be able to talk much or see her again for a bit and she seemed okay with it and said she wanted to hang out after. Now they have left and we planned to go to some art museums in town that I mentioned I\u2019ve been wanting to go to. She seemed excited to go, however the day before we planned to go she mentioned she couldn\u2019t go due to her family being in the town 2 hours away and going to see them. She set up the re-schedule and we\u2019re set to go the next week.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed she doesn\u2019t text much at all, like I\u2019ll send her something and she\u2019ll always respond very enthusiastically and thoughtfully. Like, if it took her a long time to respond she\u2019ll explain why it took her awhile, but it usually ends there. I\u2019ll send something else but she\u2019ll never respond to that. Our second date was scheduled for tomorrow but now I feel like I am in my own head over her not responding and I\u2019m assuming things are over. \n\nI wasn\u2019t able to text at all this past week due to working late every night and falling asleep when I got home. But my manager gave me off yesterday to thank me staying late, so I just sent her a happy Friday text since it was awhile since I talked to her last and asked if she could get back to me what time would work best for her for our date, she didn\u2019t text me at all the whole day and I started worrying. However that night my dog got really sick and I had to rush him to the ER where I was with him till about 3am :(. We got back home and when I woke up the next day I was still stressed from the night before that I let my anxiety get the best of me and sent another text just asking if picking her up at noon the next day would be alright. No response again. I also had other plans later on tonight and I wouldn\u2019t be around my phone, so I was hoping to just get it figured out before I left since it would\u2019ve been a pain otherwise. \n\nIt was starting to get a little close to time to leave and she still hadn\u2019t gotten back. Now I normally am fine with not getting a response because I know people are busy, But I think a mixture of all my anxiety from this, My work, and my dog the past week just kinda came to a head and I decided to just try to call her since it would\u2019ve just put my mind at ease to have the time figured out and when I will need to start getting ready to pick her up. She sent me to voicemail and I just left a short message basically just briefly saying how I haven\u2019t been talking much because of work and the situation with my dog and how I wouldn\u2019t be at my phone the rest of the night, so I was just checking what time worked for her. I said how I\u2019m still excited to go and to just shoot me a text or call whenever she can and left it at that. I stopped back home just now for like an hour and looked and she still hasn\u2019t gotten back and Im starting to think I messed it up. \n\nI understand that she still could get back to me, But I still feel like I may have overwhelmed her a bit with the amount I was following up and scared her off, which kinda makes me sad. I was really excited to see her again but I just let my anxiety get the best of me. I go to therapy for it for over a year now and have been able to develop a lot of coping strategies to help alleviate my anxiety in times of stress and they\u2019ve been really helpful and I\u2019ve noticed them working!

I was already working there for few years, she was a young girl moving to a new city for work. She is a beautiful and I was single, so I fell for her right away. We started dating soon and, since we both were looking for a place to stay (I had issues with my family, she was temporarily living at a friend\u2019s place), we rented an apartment and moved together after a bit over a month.\n\nShe wanted to pursue college, but her family could not afford that and neither could she pay for it with the salary she had then, so she could not. I offered supporting both of us financially so she can go to college and pursue a career afterwards, and she accepted. She quit her job and started studying.\n\nNow here's the problem:\n\nAfter 1.5-2 years, she started complaining that I work too much and don\u2019t spend that much time with her and that she also has no friends in this city, so she feels alone. Her college does not require lots of attendance, and we also went through lockdowns and stuff so she was studying online. I explained to her that I have to work to be able to support both of us and to save some money for our future, but I also understood her point and started taking more breaks, going out with her, going to vacations and so on.\n\nSex life was becoming awful. We had sex once a month with a bit of luck. Most of the time, once every 2 months and only if I initiated. I assumed her sex drive just lowered, so I discussed it with her multiple times. I was not asking her to match my drive, but rather to find a good compromise for both sides. She agreed each time and said she understands, and that things would only get fixed for a few days. Then it went back. Then I stopped even bringing up the subject. Sex with her started feeling like I was some sort of abuser, there was no pleasure in knowing that she doesn't want it, but she probably just did it so I won't bring it up anymore.\n\nCollege is also an issue. While she's not doing terribly, she's not doing exceptionally well either. It seems like she's more focused on obtaining her diploma than actually learning something in her courses. She barely studies for her exams and, as a result, she barely passes. I initially thought it was because maybe she did not choose the right field, at least that's what she told me. So even if I already paid for one year in that field, I encouraged her to quit and start studying another. Same results.She lacks the initiative to do anything. If I don't tell her I think she should do something, she never does anything. She just watches TV shows and reads literature all day. She has no interests, no hobbies, no friends, nothing.\n\nWhen all these things have started happening, combined with all the stress from work and just daily life matters, I started having depression episodes. It came to the point where I would drive to a secluded area and just stay there, staring into the void. I still have them. It's just too much of a responsibility carrying the weight of figuring out the lives of two people. I can't handle it. I wanted to help her achieve more than she could when I met her and I'm afraid I ended up ruining her independence for her.

He was very hot and cold, occasionally avoidant, never told me he loved me during that time even though I had told him. He was never mean, abusive, etc, but he did have a tendency to pull away every time we got close. Eventually I got tired of being pushed away and (after much communication) ended the relationship, although it was immensely painful. He flat out told me he was emotionally unavailable and could not give me what I want, leaving me little choice but to walk.\n\n\nWe went NC for several months. He contacted me once during that period asking to meet up, to which I declined. A month later, he reached back out telling me he does love me and always has and was very apologetic which was a side I hadn\u2019t seen from him, ever. \n\n\nI agreed to come back and we\u2019ve been together for about 3 months now. He is being wonderful. He tells me he loves me several times a day, is open about his feelings, drives 2 hours one way to see me, calls me if he can\u2019t see me, texts me consistently and if he\u2019s busy he will communicate that, and in person he\u2019s always been wonderful but here lately everything is just so passionate and amazing. I can be open about my feelings and he never gets mad or impatient, and he no longer pulls away when I communicate I\u2019m upset. He has all but begged me to give him a chance to fix things, and he has admitted I have no reason to trust him.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly my problem. I don\u2019t trust him. I don\u2019t trust that how he is acting is sustainable. It is like I\u2019m dating a whole new man. When I explained my concerns to him he stated the last time he was open with someone he got really hurt, and that he knew early on he loved me but he was scared to express how he really felt. \n\n\n That sounds sweet and I want to believe him, but I don\u2019t want to get hurt again. When he was hot and cold previously, those cold periods were devastating. Just as an example, I would go from hearing \u201cgood morning gorgeous\u201d, to \u201cgood morning\u201d, to \u201cmorning\u201d, to radio silence even if I reached out. Those simple little words were my first indication that he was slipping away. There were so many times I felt him pulling away from me and I knew it was coming but I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it. And every time I lost him it hurt more than the last. So as much as I want to believe him, love him, and be happy, I just want to run. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. How, if at all, do you go about trusting someone who you know can withdraw from you without a care at any moment? \n\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend seems to have changed after period of no contact, but due to previous behavior I\u2019m concerned this is temporary and I will get hurt again.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678584532.0},{"title":"My (22F) partner and I (24M)are not communicating well as she is going through depression.","author":"Own-Fun3654","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11ovrk9\/my_22f_partner_and_i_24mare_not_communicating\/","text":"Backstory: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months now.

He said, no so quick and got a little upset at me for asking. I didn\u2019t think too much of it at first, but of course I\u2019m a big over thinker so immediately I was like.. what is he hiding. So, we ended up compromising and he said he\u2019ll screen share his messages instead of giving me his password. Of course, he only went through the girls. And, one girl in particular caught my attention. Pressed on the messages, and turns out he met this girl at a concert from last year and he ended up asking for her number. And proceeded to say, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be new bestfriend\u201d.\n\nRemind you we\u2019re both fairly young, so this is more of a young person thing to do. I was a little taken back by it, because it wasn\u2019t even her asking for his number, he asked for hers to \u201ckeep in contact\u201d. He kept telling me he wanted to make a new friend but of course I didn\u2019t take it like that, because he gets mad at me for not \u201cdoing enough\u201d when a dude ask for my number. Remind you, I at least tell the dudes I have a boyfriend and I\u2019m not interested. But, it\u2019s like I felt so disrespected. And even though it was last year, it just makes me wonder if he has done this more than once. For a week straight, we were arguing over the same topic.

I (21m) am wondering about the state of a relationship I have with a person I met online (22f) and how I should proceed. I\u2019ll outline the history of our relationship so far for context. \n\nWe met in winter of 2021 through a mutual interest group and immediately became friends. Though the first few months of our correspondence was sporadic, we\u2019d always be really happy to see each other. She gave me advice and encouragement, and even though she knew less about me than I did her, she came to trust me enough to confide in me personally. She\u2019s the first friend with whom I\u2019ve maintained something of a long-term relationship. She\u2019s a good person and I\u2019m glad to have her in my life. \n\nWell, lo and behold, after a couple seasons I developed a crush on her. I flirted with her, she rejected me, but things were still cool between us for a while after. However, I was totally inexperienced with having serious feelings for someone. I tried ignoring it, but I ended up straining our relationship and not speaking to her for over a month. \n\nI came back, and things have been gradually redeveloping since. She has a boyfriend now, her first since coming out as trans. I have been slowly building other relationships. And fortunately, she still confides in me whenever we talk. But I feel things could be better. It\u2019s somewhat of a repeat of the situation a year ago, when we kept in touch but only intermittently.  \n\nI\u2019ve been very careful these past couple months to not push her. However, she\u2019s left the group we met in, so all contact between us now must be entirely direct. We still talk, but  only once a week if not more. Every day I\u2019ll see she\u2019s online and it hurts to avoid her for the sake of etiquette.  She\u2019s bad about reaching out to people in general, but it\u2019s kind of driving me crazy not being in contact with her more often when she\u2019d likely be happy to speak with me. \n\nOur relationship is in a sort of limbo between silence and trust, yet I want her to be an everyday part of my life again. She\u2019s busy lately and has less time in general, but I think it might be worth bringing this up. What should I do? Should I express this to her, or should I be more patient?\n\nTl;dr Strong online friendship that went through a period of strain has slowly repaired. I want to speak to this person more often, not sure if I should try","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678575665.0},{"title":"How do I (29M) not get hung up on what might have been with her (25F)?","author":"Flaky-Astronomer8205","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11os5u7\/how_do_i_29m_not_get_hung_up_on_what_might_have\/","text":"This is long, I\u2019m sorry haha. I\u2019m a guy who is very cautious who I date (I\u2019m divorced and been burned badly) and don\u2019t even consider getting into a relationship very easily. I know what I have to offer and what I need so I\u2019d rather be single than in a bad relationship.\n\nRecently I finally was ready to take the leap. I\u2019d been seeing this woman (25F) with a kid for a few months. We live an hour away and she has her kid every other week so seeing each other was great, but not super often. Like 1-2 times a week. We connected so well in person, and I loved our calls whenever she was able to answer, and we texted all the time.\n\nEarly on we really hit it off and she started talking hypothetical future situations and making plans and I found myself buying in. And after each date she would always say how much she loved it and loved creating these new memories with me. She had said she was a good communicator, and it seemed that way. She reassured me when I needed it, and we could always talk about things in life we disagreed about in a healthy way. Things were going so well.\n\nOne thing that was difficult was that she would say that she wanted to date me, but didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship yet. And I thought it made sense due to her past and not knowing each other for super long so I understood, but it did make me feel a little anxious sometimes since she did it in a way that was a little hot and cold (\u201cI really like you and I just bought tickets for us to go to a concert in July\u201d, \u201cI think we need more time to get to know each other\u201d, etc.). But I was ok taking it slow because I trusted her and wasn\u2019t trying to rush things either. \n\nThen last weekend shit hit the fan. We had been planning on her coming down on Saturday and going to a play we\u2019ve been planning on for a month, and spending the weekend. On Friday night she went out with a friend who just got cheated on. We had texted about her sending me funny drunk texts and texting back and forth a bit, and I also told her to be supportive of her friend. Well she occasionally sent me some pictures and I would respond and flirt (usually within 45 minutes) and ask how it was going to check on her, but she would respond in like 30 minutes with another picture but without responding to my actual texts. I ended up falling asleep at 11:15 and she got super mad and at 2 am said she hated when I did that, \u201cwhat if something had happened tonight\u201d, and said we needed to postpone the weekend date. I told her the next day I was sorry and didn\u2019t realize that she expected me to stay up talking to her but that I\u2019d be more than happy to next time now that I know (she only goes out like 3-4 times a year).\n\nOn Saturday\/Sunday there was minimal interaction. On Monday she called and we talked and she said she understood me and that she missed me and was embarrassed by how she reacted. Then after the call she texted and said she missed me and said she could come down this weekend. I felt things were better. Then Tuesday morning she texted me good morning, called me babe, and said she was thinking of me. I responded and said I was too and asked how her day went. She said it was the anniversary of one of her friends deaths and that she was super anxious. So I asked what I could do and if she wanted to talk and she said maybe a call later. After work I went to see Creed and texted her to say we needed to go together, and all she said was \u201cyeah\u201d. Then I tried calling her and she sent it to voicemail after 2 rings. I texted her saying I called her to check in that I was thinking about her, and said to call me back when she could. All she did was like the message and I never heard back.\n\nThis kind of communication is a dealbreaker since I need to be with someone who can communicate and work through unintentional miscommunication and pain that happens. Looking back I can\u2019t really see any red flags to avoid this, but it\u2019s so frustrating because a small part of me keeps saying that maybe I could have done something better and that this past week was just a one time bad communication (I know it\u2019s not) and I keep reliving the conversations and also looking at the lost plans we had made and get sad. I obviously don\u2019t want to be in a relationship like this and I never will be, but my old anxious attachment is coming out and I\u2019m just frustrated at myself for it. I feel like I wasted so much time and energy only to be completely lied to, and it makes me feel like a horrible judge of character. Has anyone else been there and have any advice?\n\n\nTL;DR Great potential with this woman and dated for some months. She got upset I didn\u2019t stay up texting her all night when she was out drinking with her friend. Ended up apologizing and calling me babe again, making plans, only to then ghost me.

The first 4 months of our relationship was long distance, and now that we've been in the same place for a while, I'm noticing some things that are raising flags for me.\n\nMy boyfriend has admitted that he doesn't express affection easily. He said that his past relationships ended because of this. The main things that I have hangups with doesn't give words of affection and I initiate sex most of the time. These are two hangups for me that I've communicated with him about a few times. But each time I've brought it up, he first gets extremely irritated, then says he'll \"do better.\" I've also pointed out that I do small things for him all the time, ex. bake his favorite cake, pick him up a candy bar when he's having a bad day, etc., and that I don't need stuff like that all the time, but it would be nice if he could do those small gestures now and then. I specifically brought up buying flowers as an example, and he basically said, \"I was planning on buying you flowers this weekend, but if I give them to you now it makes it seem like I only did it because you asked!\" It's been two months since that conversation, and neither those flowers nor any other gesture has materialized. Meanwhile, I am always anticipating and fulfilling his needs, as well as accepting and working on the things he thinks I could do to make our relationship better.\n\nI also told him that I want him to plan dates every once in a while. We do stuff together like hiking and rock climbing, which are both our favorite hobbies, but I want to do different stuff now and again. I've planned romantic dates for us before, and asked if he could put in effort to do the same. I was met by him telling me that he doesn't see the point because the outdoors-y stuff we do together is \"so much more interesting than going to dinner or going mini-golfing\" (his examples, not mine). So we always end up doing what he wants.\n\nThe one emotion he definitely has is anger. He gets frustrated extremely easily by little things. For example, when we were eating dinner, I accidentally got food on one of his blankets. He got angry and told me I don't respect his things. I told him afterwards that if he had done the same thing to a possession of mine, I would've just laughed it off and thrown it in the wash. Just this morning, he couldn't get a container to open and he was cursing for five straight minutes. This really triggers me because my dad was exactly the same way: irritated and ranting all the time over anything. However, I just stay quiet when he's venting and let it pass. He doesn't do the same for me when I get annoyed. He gets irritated when I am and tells me to \"calm down\" and says he \"doesn't know why I'm being like this.\"\n\nThe worst way in which his anger manifests is when I'm expressing my feelings. I am an admittedly insecure person, and I've been in therapy to work on that and my anxiety (I'm putting the work in, and I'm proud of myself for getting better!). This week, when I was telling him that I felt like I was putting more effort into the relationship than he was and that I felt unappreciated, he blew up, saying he \"can't believe you're bringing this up again.\" I started crying and told him that maybe I shouldn't stay the night because we obviously can't have a productive conversation right now. He said that if I was going to leave, I should also leave the key to his apartment behind. This isn't the first time he's said something along these lines. Whenever we argue, he blows it up and tells me to not come back. I told him he needs to stop doing that because I believe it's manipulative. I have always forgiven him for it, and he begs me to.\n\nWhen I get mad or express my feelings, it's the end of the world for him. But when he does it, he's asking me for forgiveness and that he'll try harder. I haven't seen that progress from him whatsoever, and I'm almost at the end of my rope. I also feel like I might be asking for too much from him and that maybe the problem is me for being too needy. Is there any way I can do better in communicating with him to try and make this work?\n\nTLDR; My boyfriend gets annoyed or angry when I express my needs and emotions.

I am in a situation Where I dont know what to do or think. Me and my boyfriend are in a long distance relationship. We sometimes have fights but I feel like with good communication we always end up on good terms.\nI once caught him having contact with his ex. He told me that the girl is a family member of his, so I didnt really think much into it. But once I noticed how his \u201cfamily member\u201d looked like, and how she looked exactly like his ex. So I took his phone and looked through their messages, where I could see pictures of the girl. I put 2 and 2 together, and realised that was his ex. They didnt message much, and it was pretty much only once in a while about random stuff. I confronted him, he said he was sorry for lying but that he was not gonna delete her as they stayed as friends. I did not accept that so he ended up deleting her, and I forgave him. \nLater I find out she contacted him again and they started messaging a bit again. I found it on his phone display. It was a few messages, and she was asking him if he would come visit her for her birthday (she lives far away) he didnt turn her down, but also didnt say a clear no either. I get mad and he says hes gonna delete her, but I tell him that hes just gonna end up in contact w her again if he deletes her because I said so, and not because he wants to. I somehow agree to them having contact again if I get to see all of their conversations - and he did show me everything.\nLater, he tells me her told her they cant have contact atain cause he realised it was disrespectful to me. He tells her that, they end up in a big fight and she Blocks him. But he told me he was fine with it cause he knows it was disrespectful to have contact with her while in a relationship.\nSo this is a couple of months ago, everythings going great, no major issues. \nSome days ago I asked him whats wrong cause I could feel some things have been nagging him. He said he didnt wanna talk about it so I let it be. Yesterday I ask into it again and he says nothing, he does not wanna bother me with it and that it would just make me annoyed \/ upset. I ssk him multiple times and he then says what I was thinking it was: he was sad that he and his ex are on bad terms and that it ended with them blocking eachother. I was obviously sad but I had just promised him that I wouldnt be upset og get mad at him. He had dreamt some dreams about her that made him think about her again -  not in a romantic way but that he misses their friendship, and also regrets some of the mesn things he said in the heat of their argument. \nI know its all over the place but so is my mind. I think this is the best way to phrase it.  so what should I do? I feel like he isnt over her yet, I even told him that I feel like hes not over her but he said that I was overthinking and that he definitiely is over her. I just dont get thwt feeling, and also dont wanna bring it up again cause hes tired of me mentioning her (I did that a lot in the past when I was hurt)\nWhat would you do \/ think about the whole situation? And I dont want comments about I shouldnt go through his phone - I had a gut feeling, listened to it and turned out I was right\n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend has had contact with his ex, the first time he lied about her being his family member which I found out shes not, second time she contacts him and he answers and has contact wirh her again until I find out the second time.

I\u2019m having a meltdown over it and can\u2019t find the courage to just push that I\u2019m going.\nSo I asked him if he\u2019d wait just a little longer and I\u2019d go through whatever safety things my mom wanted me to do and when I got there I\u2019d make it up to him.\n\nHe\u2019s very upset about it.. and I understand how he feels.. but I just feel almost helpless. Everytime I do try to stand up for myself with my mom it never works. I just don\u2019t know what to do.. my mom is interfering with a relationship that\u2019s important to me and to him it\u2019s coming off as it\u2019s not important to me because I can\u2019t find the courage to be firm that I\u2019m going to go see him.

I\u2019ve known this guy for 4 years and there has always been some sexual tension between us but timing never allowed us to pursue each other.

Partner was hurt at first, but thankful for my honesty and grateful that I value his and my freedom. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my partner roughly a year and a half. One week ago, he surprised me by calling me his girlfriend. I was pleasantly surprised as we had discussed a couple months prior how we were tiptoeing around labeling our relationship, yet we were fine with what we had, even if we weren\u2019t ready to describe it. Even a mental health professional thought it was a healthy decision for both of us to not rely heavily on labels. I suppose that changed when he first told me he Loved me. \u201cLove\u201d is a word I don\u2019t take lightly and we\u2019d talked about that months before he said it. It was kinda cute how it happened: We\u2019d had a heartfelt conversation about familial relationships and we both wanted to say it, but hesitated. Then we opened up about why we were hesitating. I told him that I was afraid I would hyper-fixate on wanting to move near him so we could be closer, which could take months if not years, since we both had recently made big life decisions and moved to a different place in our respective states. This fixation could put a strain on our relationship, I\u2019d feared. He said he understood my concerns and assured me there was no rush bc our love for one another developed without me making these changes. Then he said he loved me. Since I personally believe love transcends time and space, I told him I loved him too. That feeling has not changed and I don\u2019t think it ever will. \n\nA few weeks later, I brought up the idea of polyamory and open relationships. I was honest with how I felt, saying that we were young and inexperienced, so it would be selfish of me to deny him of experimenting with others, especially since I\u2019m pansexual and he\u2019s bisexual. He was uncomfortable with what I said and asked for clarification, to which we discussed how we felt for a couple of hours. We talked about our insecurities. My biggest insecurity was the potential inevitability of one or both of us developing a strong relationship with another person, that we would not be the primary support partner for each other, which could get tricky if we shared assets one day. His biggest insecurity was me seeing other men. Even though I\u2019m pan, I don\u2019t form strong bonds with others very easily, so it is unlikely I\u2019d have enough time to even see other men, let alone anyone else on the spectrum. But since our libidos are different, I still thought it a good idea to open up an avenue for both of us to experiment regardless. We came to the conclusion that for now, monogamy is best as there\u2019s so much richness in one another that we\u2019d like to explore. I still believe this. \n\nBut one week ago, he called me his girlfriend. And while I was happy, it\u2019s also a term I take very seriously. Quite frankly, it\u2019s a label that has implications of being fully committed to each other\u2019s well being. I blushed and giggled, and called him my boyfriend, openly communicating my surprised joy. For me, this was a sign that it wasn\u2019t foolish of me to spend the next couple of years securing a life with him. \n\nThat brings us to today. He asks me if I\u2019ve ever experimented with women before and I replied with of course. We never had a problem talking about our past relationships, so this question wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary for me. He says he\u2019s never experimented with a man, but he\u2019d like to one day. I asked him if this meant that he wanted an open relationship, to which he replied he think he could see himself in one. I thought it was a nice thing we could have a conversation about later to see how we should move forward with our relationship. i.e., I wanted to set time aside later to talk more about it before we made that decision. Then he asks me, \u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re in an open relationship?\u201d I laughed and asked \u201cAlready? \ud83d\ude06\u201d. He said yes. \n\nOkay. I realized he was serious and remembered that not only am I young, but he\u2019s even *younger*. There\u2019s so much space and beauty in this world for a person in their 20s to explore, and even though we\u2019re committed to each other now, there\u2019s no way in hell that\u2019s guaranteed for a lifetime. I love living in the moment, yet I also like to prepare myself for the future. And the future I glimpsed when he told me that was full of resistance from the loosely monogamous relationship we currently have. A familiar knot in my stomach formed and I asked myself if I was acting on insecurity. It didn\u2019t feel like insecurity; it felt like maturity. So I told him that I loved him and because I love him, I\u2019d like to remain label-less. At first, he thought he\u2019d done something wrong. So we talked for an hour about why I made my decision. My idea of love is being committed to my partner\u2019s wellbeing and a HUGE part of my wellbeing is freedom. If I want freedom for myself (even if it\u2019s not geared toward relationships), it would be selfish of me to not grant that freedom to someone else. It was hard and I did cry later, but I believe I saved both of us a world of confusion, betrayal, and hurt. \n\nHe told me that no matter what happens between us, he will be eternally happy and grateful he got a chance to love me, which is something I\u2019ve told him in the past. \n\nI still love him and he still loves me. I\u2019m so young, though, and it eats at me that I\u2019m being foolish for not wanting to be his gf, at least not yet. I don\u2019t have a problem with open and poly relationships, but I only brought it up to him bc weren\u2019t officially bf & gf. I want to be closer to him, but I want to give him space to explore other people.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678566653.0},{"title":"Guy (15) started talking to me (F15) and he seemed nice, are there grounds for me to talk to him next time i see him or no?","author":"No_Secretary_2624","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11ou71h\/guy_15_started_talking_to_me_f15_and_he_seemed\/","text":"idk if this is the right place for this though if it's not please redirect me to a better place.\n\nSo at church we were all playing a game (like my whole grade and one above so all in the same age range) and we were all I'm a circle, I was across from him and he was staring in my direction, probably zoned out cause he was just like staring and because I'm how i am I smiled (to not seem rude ofc) and widened my eyes at him and he instantly smiled and looked away, after we both got out of the game while we waited for it to end I had two options, sit next to him or a random other kid I didn't know (little context here, he's my friends brother and I hang out with a lot of people he's friends with so yeah I guess I semi-knew him?)\n\nSo I sat next to him and one of my other friends sat next to me so I was talking to her and he randomly started talking to me asking stuff about my family and just like my life in general, he asked about siblings and stuff like that and eventually we started joking around before we had to go sit down. He sat in front of me not knowing it and then he turned around to stretch and saw me and smiled super wide and started waving and I waved back and he kept looking back at me and either smiling or trying to joke around, I was like \"yeah maybe there's someone behind me-\" but unless I responded to it he'd just continue on and there weren't any rows behind me either so-\n\nAfter the lesson ended I was walking back inside after walking my friend to her car and I decided to be bold and I joked with him, one of his friends was throwing a Frisbee at him and I was like \"are you being murdered right now?\" And he was like \"yes, I'm being held hostage.\" And we joked around  for a bit and once again he asked me stuff like if i was in the lower grade in the group or the higher one and stuff and idk he seemed nice and friendly and he's funny and stuff so my question is, are there grounds for me to talk to him again on Sunday? \n\nThis happened about 3-4 days ago and I'm seeing him tomorrow was he just being nice in the moment and if I talk to him again on Sunday would that be weird?- Or could this be the start of a friendship possibly?

I (24F) run a YouTube channel with three of my friends. We\u2019ll call them A (32M), B (21NB) and C (20M). We\u2019ve all been a friend group for over two years, but some of us knew others in the group for longer or shorter. This is more about A as the channel used to only be his, but the rest of us joined in. Partly because we had ideas for it that he liked, but also because doing it solo was stressing him out. I was very excited for this opportunity in particular as the channel is on a topic I really enjoy, plus I love creating media and posting it. I\u2019ve been having a blast with it and put a lot of my worth into what I create. Things started out great. We hold meetings to plan out what releases when and have systems in place. I\u2019m also doing a majority of the marketing. It\u2019s great!\n\nWell a few months after making this a team thing, I started to notice things. First of all, I\u2019ve posted the most content out of the four of us. I thought this was fine and inevitable, since everyone else had full time jobs and other responsibilities (I\u2019m currently jobless and not in education, so my only other responsibility is my own channel). Plus I really wanted to help where I can. I\u2019m pretty useless in other aspects of the channel, so I want to do as much as I can where I won\u2019t suck as much.\n\nThen A\u2019s mental health started to slip and he went on hiatus (the rest of us were in agreement that this is best). Since again I don\u2019t have a life, I tried my best to fill his place to ensure that the channel still had frequent content. No one told me to do this or anything. I just took initiative since it would only be for a couple of months. I also started planning a backlog of content for when I go back into education in September, so I don\u2019t leave others dry.\n\nThen a few days ago, B mentioned that they wanted to take a step back and take a more supporting role. They wouldn\u2019t be quitting or on hiatus. But they wanted to focus more on behind the scenes stuff. While telling us this, they mentioned to me specifically not to try and fill the void that they leave and they noticed I was doing that for A. I explained that I didn\u2019t mind and that I really wanted to help since I don\u2019t have anything else going on besides my own channel. But they insisted on this and urged me to slow down. When I then mentioned that I needed to start a backlog for when I started school, then instantly shut down the idea, saying it would likely destroy me.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ll be fine. But they sounded serious and I know to trust them when they\u2019re like that, so I said I\u2019d slow down. How do I explain this to A though? Unlike the rest of us, he treats the channel more like a business than the rest of us and likes things a certain way. Like missing deadlines stresses him out and he cares about the statistics a lot more. I was happy working at the rate I was at, but if a friend sees an issue with it, I trust them. But the other friend might not notice or understand. Plus I don\u2019t want to upset him or make it seem like I\u2019m stepping back too.\n\nTL;DR One friend is worried that I\u2019m working on a group channel too much and wants me to slow down.

He said yes ,, 20 min later he calls me and while we\u2019re on the phone he says he\u2019s too stoned to pick me up and he\u2019s going home. Ofc I respect his decision - but I was bummed- I had thought he was on his way and I was excited. He thought I was being short on the phone, and I could tell he was kind of annoyed with me. I wasn\u2019t trying to be short- but I was with my friends still- fast forward - I text him and ask if he\u2019s going to bed. He said yes. (He\u2019s a huge gamer- so when I checked discord and it said he was playing a game I wasn\u2019t shocked) I texted him and said oh, it says your playing a game online? He said his computer must have been left on- but that he was going to bed- and didn\u2019t like how I was treating him. (He explained that I was trying to start an argument by making him feel bad for not getting me- and he was immediately triggered when I brought up it said he was online) the conversation ended. \n\n\nWhile this was all happening I was at my friends house eating and drinking water- I hadn\u2019t drank anything in hours so I decided to drive home.

I wasn\u2019t being rude I just said \u201cyou lied\u201d because it\u2019s been over an hour at this point since he said he was going to bed.

I was so confused because he was being so rude!! I am mediately regretted driving home because I didn\u2019t want to be there after he started yelling at me. I packed a bag and drove to a parking lot, balled my eyes out, then slept in my car. However only slept for 15 minutes. A few hours later I decided to just go home and sleep on the couch. I would hardly say I actually was able to sleep because I was so distraught all night. He left for work two hours ago, and I can\u2019t stop replaying it all in my head. When he was yelling at me last night, he said that I was a master manipulator that he wasn\u2019t gonna let me flip all of this on him, I didn\u2019t name call him, I wasn\u2019t trying to argue- but it seemed like nothing that I did could\u2019ve changed the fact that he just didn\u2019t want to talk to me be around me be nice to me etc. \n\n\nI think he was taking his frustration out on me. He had lied to me, said that he wasn\u2019t playing games, then I walked to the door and he was. I think he just felt guilty because he had been caught in lies- but for him to turn so nasty on me it\u2019s not OK.. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to text me.

I am not worried about cheating.\n\n\nHello. \n\nI am lost, confused, hurt, and want to find some truth about whether I am being a demanding asshole or whether this is all not my fault. I am a highly emotionally intelligent person, however, I am worried and I want some advice because I am at a loss in the face of an unprecedented (in my life) situation. If I am being completely unreasonable, or an asshole, please tell me, because I am always willing to learn from my mistakes and emotions.\n\nI have been dating a girl for a year now. We have an amazing relationship. I love her more than I have ever loved anyone. I am considering to maybe even marrying and starting a family with her. So...I love her that much. Since our relationship started we have been seeing each other more and more. Recently it started to be daily (by \"recently\" I mean a few months ago). She is a very complicated person, and I always check with her if she really wants to be meeting or if she is appeasing me. Because I am personally in need of a constant connection. If I don't see her or meet her for a day or two I start to miss her. But every time we meet she says she also wants to meet. So figured it is okay to meet daily. She has a condition of medical nature of which I will not disclose any detail. However one of the aspects of it is that she may have fatigue sometimes.\n\nRecently she started to ask for more personal space. And by recently I mean a few months ago. So I started to give her more space. I started to message less. I started to visit her physically less. I started to give her fewer gifts (we are neighbors so I used to drop flowers in her postbox or a letter before she goes to work or when she comes back so she gets something nice, I have left over 79 flowers for her and 49 letters, I have kept count; she always loved them and preserved them all, bar the flowees). \n\nI don't go to events she goes to any longer, I don't participate in her events and gettogethers, etc. I, on the other hand always invite her to events, but she barely ever comes, or comes extremely late. I have been participating in sports events and networking events and I always invite her but she always says that she will see if she can or not attend. And oftentimes she does not come. I try to involve her in my social life, I always her, but she barely ever comes. But she barely invited me to hers. I do not judge her, I try to think that maybe she wants her space. I am not jealous or judgmental. I want her to have a life outside our relationship.\n\n\nSo she says she wants more space. I give her more space. And she acknowledges it. She was happy. But this last week she was upset. She had mood swings left and right. And it culminated in her telling me on Saturday morning (when we were meant to go for a run together) that she just wants to be left alone. And that nobody speaks to her or bothers her. So we agreed that I do not see her this weekend. Or the workweek either...\n\nShe says she needs time to herself. I understand. But I am concerned. She has never been like this before. We have never decided not to meet for the entire weekend at all. She seems fine meeting other people and hanging out with them, but not with me. \n\nIn the past, she had PMS which was very bad (I mean... extremely bad), and she lashed out at me and verbally abused me almost. And told me extremely hurtful things for which she would apologize afterward (I never asked for an apology except maybe once or twice). I was always trying to be accommodating and understanding. But she told me that she was only mean to me and not to other people. During her PMS periods she could and would hang out with anyone else, but she could not be with me. Because, as she said, she would be mean to me. \n\nSo now, I am alone on Saturday evening, and my girlfriend does not talk to me. I suggested a new place, a new experience but she just says she needs her own time to herself. Should I be worried? Am I doing something wrong? If she wants time to herself, that is fine, but it worries me...\n\nPlease help and maybe share an advice because I was in a number of relationships in the past and this has never happened before to me.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678559566.0},{"title":"Girl (24F) I'm (25M) talking to seems to care but is throwing me off","author":"ThrowRA9474736","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11orbr9\/girl_24f_im_25m_talking_to_seems_to_care_but_is\/","text":"So a few weeks back, I asked a girl I like to hang out (wasn't the first time).

In short, he\u2019s the first guy I\u2019ve ever felt like I might seriously marry. He treats me so well, things feel easy and exciting, and I feel like we\u2019re intellectual and personality equals with similar values, or so I thought. \n\nAbout me: I\u2019m 26 and finishing my BA degree this semester. I did a lot of start\/stop with school due mostly to the fact that I prioritized working over my education. A matter of fact, as valuable as I see education, I\u2019m only completing my degree to raise the ceiling on my career prospects. While going to school full time, I also work full time in an admin role in the field I plan on staying in. I\u2019ve been offered higher positions before (even ones they want a bachelors for), but have made it clear that I don\u2019t want to take on managerial responsibilities and time commitments until I finish this degree; I\u2019m already spread thin as it is. Once I\u2019m done, it\u2019s full speed ahead career-wise, and I feel pretty confident about securing a higher level position given my established years of experience and newly updated education. I\u2019ve explained this to my boyfriend. \n\nAbout him: it\u2019s maybe important to note that my boyfriend is first gen from an Asian family. He lives and breathes academic and career validation, and his family places a great deal of pressure on him. He is the classic definition of a workaholic, which isn\u2019t a huge issue for me because we are both extremely busy and the time we do spend together is quality- plus we talk regularly throughout the day. His dedication to his career is something I love about him, and he\u2019s been very successful with a high-level position. He\u2019s also completing his MBA in a fully-employed program and is VERY passionate about finance and financial security, things I admittedly know little to nothing about, but have never been unwilling to learn. \n\nThe issue: Without going into how I found it (I didn\u2019t snoop through his phone, swear), I found his Reddit account. It wasn\u2019t anything alarming until I saw he made a post asking for advice about me. Essentially, he used words like \u201cintelligent, selfless, amazing\u201d to describe me, and then went on to say that he is concerned I don\u2019t have enough \u201cdrive\u201d to have a better career. In this post, he didn\u2019t claim it was about money. It was jarring for me, but I chose to let it go. He\u2019s allowed to have concerns and voice them \u201canonymously\u201d if it helps him. \n\nHowever, this past week, he made another post in a financial independence subreddit. This time, he made it about money. He outlined how much money he makes (which I\u2019ve never even asked him), how much he thinks I make, and expressed concern that we wouldn\u2019t be able to have kids with our income (which, mind you, would be a combined $300k). He said he wants to retire early and I don\u2019t have that \u201cfire\u201d in me to go further. He said his decision to propose to me hinges on this issue. He also conveniently left out that I\u2019m still in school, so I was confused why he would seek out anonymous advice if he was going to omit that key detail. Not only that, he\u2019s never actually talked to me about this, even though it\u2019s obviously an issue for him. I even asked him if he has an issue with my current job after he kept bringing up the lucrative careers of his friends\u2019 partners and he said no. I gave him an opportunity to talk to me about it on a silver platter.\n\nThe comments were pretty negative towards him- telling him his priorities are completely wrong and that he\u2019d be dumb to give up a solid partner in exchange for a more high-earning one. I\u2019m now doubting my entire relationship with him; I wonder if he sees me as inferior to him, or what he would want our future to look like should we ever get married. I always planned on having a career- I never planned on being financially reliant on my husband or a SAHM. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019d expect things to work with having kids or building a real life together if both of us are stretched thin workaholics. I want to raise my kids, not hand them to a nanny the moment they pop out. More importantly, I don\u2019t want a partner who puts a dollar amount on my worth to him or secretly looks down on me because I don\u2019t make as much money as him. I do get the feeling he\u2019s more concerned about status than he is about financial security, which is unappealing to me. I come from a pretty privileged background, my dad is a doctor, but I don\u2019t get joy from having feelings of superiority over other people. \n\nFrankly, I feel like shit. I\u2019m stressing out with work and midterms while also tending to my basic needs and this relationship, and his post just made me feel like none of it will ever be enough. I feel like I\u2019m spiraling and letting it get in my head- crying on and off and can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s just making things more stressful. My hands are tied and I don\u2019t know what else I can do at this moment. It makes me feel unworthy. It\u2019s even more strange to think that if I hadn\u2019t seen his Reddit, I would have NO clue he feels this way.\n\nShould I confront him about this? Should I just leave him with the knowledge that he sees himself as superior to me? Should I just get over it or wait to see if he brings it up? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to keep this knowledge in and move past it, especially when I know it\u2019s been on his mind enough to make multiple posts about it. I\u2019m so afraid that even when I take the next career step, it still won\u2019t be enough. How should I handle this?\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend has posted on Reddit several times complaining that I don\u2019t make as much money as him or have a better career even though I\u2019m still in school. He hasn\u2019t talked to me about this at all.

We've been together for 21 months, living together for about 6 of those months.\n\nWhen we started getting more serious, my gf told me she had a deadline in her mind of about 2 years of dating before she would need to know whether a marriage was coming or not so she can make plans. For better understanding, she is an immigrant in the US on a work visa, so she does have pressure for marriage, not just from family but also from her situation in that she wants some assurance on where and how she is going to live. Living in the US on a work visa is not a stable arrangement as many recently laid off H1-b tech workers can tell you.\n\nI am empathetic to these needs, and as a 34 year old man (33 when she told me this) I do not have forever either, so I understood this. As we get closer to this deadline though, I am beginning to feel more and more pressure and the thoughts that a marriage that we would have would not be based on a strong enough foundation and wouldn't be for the right reasons. \n\nI love her, make no mistake. She treats me like a king, almost to a fault. We have similar interests and goals. She puts a lot of work and energy into me and I have actually told her it feels like I have a mother sometimes lol. When I have concerns, she listens and takes action to correct things. She is into mindfulness and health and supports me in those goals as well.\n\nShe does not have a demanding career, works maybe 20-25 hours a week as a therapist. I know she wants to do more, but maybe is waiting until marriage where she can legally start her own business to make more. That is part of the problem though, because I feel pressure there to marry her and that I am marrying more of an \"idea\" of her than who she is now. We have a value mismatch around money as well, as her parents have money via inheritance to give her and thus is not as motivated as me to work for my own money which we sometimes fight about. I like working, I enjoy it. She does not.\n\nI also sometimes feel that she was just looking for a man to marry, and I was the safest choice. That doesn't exactly inspire confidence in me that this is right. Maybe this is all an act she is putting on now and then when we get married and she gets her green card then she will change? Again, shaky foundation.\n\nI think to add to this, however embarrassing, is that I am feeling pressure to marry in my own heart and not for the best reasons. I am 34. I am now the oldest child\/grandchild in my family to be unmarried. All my friends are getting married and having babies. I am feeling a bit like the music is stopping and if I don't settle now I will end up alone. This fear has been a bit consuming as of late.\n\nI am reasonably good looking, in good health, and make good money in a large metro area. I would probably have a good time dating tbh, but I just don't want to. Modern dating is a hellscape and I am not excited about the prospect of dating other older single people who are afraid of commitment and got left out just like me.\n\nI don't trust my own feelings at times. I can't tell if these are legitimate concerns or if it's just my noncommittal past and fear preventing me from experiencing true happiness. I'm trying to prevent the situation where I marry her for the wrong reasons and then in 5 years we are both miserable. I take marriage very seriously and would rather be alone than in a marriage I hate and have to get a divorce.\n\nI wrote this post because her Mom came to visit from a far away country and they took a road trip for a few days and I've had some alone time to think deeply about all this for the first time in a while. They are back now and I actually expressed a lot of this to my gf last night and she was empathetic and is willing to listen to me as I work this out in my head. That alone I feel is worth a lot.\n\nApologies if this is a bit disjointed I am probably not communicating this so well and of course I cannot encapsulate an entire relationship in a form like this as it's quite complex. But here it is. \n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Having doubts about continuing this relationship into marriage due to pressure and fears.

She made it clear that me going soft didn't bother her and she knew it could happen. We cuddled like crazy and I suggested going steady, which she agreed to. Next day, I got quite a few chit-chatty texts from her like last time.\n\nThis last week though, she's been weird. I initiated contact both times, and while she's responded and without delay, her replies have been short. I scheduled another date which she agreed to, although her messages were short and seemed pretty cold, and she got a bit pissed off that I didn't buy the tickets for both of us to the event we planned to go to; I'd assumed we'd get our own. She canceled the next day cus a storm hit our part of the country, but my gut told me that she wasn't that enthused to go to begin with. She did mention having a shitty week at work, which is probably a factor but still, why agree to go in the first place then if you're in a bad mood?\n\nI've gone on a trip to another country for the weekend. After she cancelled our date I said we'd do something when I get back, to which she replied with just a smile emoji, which I found very mixed. That was 4 days ago; she hasn't text me at all, meaning re-initiating contact will again be up to me. I feel that after you've been on a few dates, a girl should be initiating contact at least now and again, although maybe it can differ... Again, lack of experience showing here.\n\nI dunno, Reddit. Has she lost interest, or are mixed messages like this normal? I'll admit, this is the first time I've gotten past a 3rd date in quite a few months, so I am acting kinda anxious. I checked my dating app (I currently have my profile turned off) and I've noticed that her location still changes time to time, so she definitely still opens it.\n\nWould like some advice on whether I still have a shot and what I should do. Thanks.\n\nTl;dr -- Been on 3 dates with a girl. She seemed reasonably enthusiastic until the last week, when she agreed to a 4th date but her responses have been way shorter and colder than normal. She cancelled due to bad weather and I said we'd do something when I get back from my trip, which she replied to with just a smile emoji. I'm pretty sure she still checks her dating apps despite us going steady. We got somewhat sexual on our 3rd date. Would like to know whether I should still pursue her.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678552710.0},{"title":"Couples who have broken up and gotten back together after working on each of your issues, what\u2019s your advice?","author":"No-Apple-9345","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11o751a\/couples_who_have_broken_up_and_gotten_back\/","text":"My partner (28M) and I (25F) broke up this week after 2.5 years together.

I am his first girlfriend, first love, first sexual relationship, etc. He used to be a player, and had a bad reputation. No one thought him like he is with me. \n\nNormally he is easygoing, really comfortable with girls, and really friendly. \nWith me, he is really shy, and is really bad at flirting lol. But I find it cute. \n\nHe started really fast with our relationship. He took me to dinner for our first month, I met his mother and his close friends. He told me he loved me at our first month, and talked about a future with me. \nIt kinda scared me because I thought he was love bombing me, but I think it is because no one ever treated me like that. I had  two relationships before, but they never really cared about me. On the other hand, he takes care of me, takes me on a lot of dates, and tries to spend as much time with me as he can. When he isn\u2019t when his friends or studying , he tries to see me. \nIf he could he would see me everyday, but I personally don\u2019t need to see him more than 1-2 times a week. So we see each other 4 times a week. He almost always initiates and organizes our dates. \n\nI thought that first relationships for guys were abusive, but he really treats me like a queen. \n\nBut last week, he moved cities, because he was changing schools. I don\u2019t know why, but he was really anxious and therefore more irritable. \nSo one time he picked up a fight with me because I didn\u2019t answer his text for two hours because I was with my family. He told me I didn\u2019t put effort in the relationship and we argued for 3 hours. \nNext day he apologized and told me he didn\u2019t have to react like that. He corrected his mistakes and doesn\u2019t ever bother me when i don\u2019t answer his texts.

I told him that nothing had to be changed. \n\nHe then left me more space since that two incidents and reassures me that I shouldn\u2019t be apologizing when i can\u2019t answer and that he made a mistake. \n\nHe has never been mean but he made me cry that two times.

i met his grandmother and brother and would stay over at his (i\u2019ve been told this is a big deal for an arab family). later in the summer he left to go back to his home country to spend the rest of summer there and he basically cut me off - we weren\u2019t officially dating but still it hurt. before he officially cut me off i soon realised he was seeing another girl he\u2019d met back home;

But first I will grant you some backstory in order to make it as unbiased as possible! Also excuse my english, I'm from france so that english is not my first language! :)  and this is the second acc so she won t notice\n\nFirst off I want to start off by saying that I m deaf 22m, I\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend 21f for coming up on 5 months, we hit it off INSANELY well and we both felt like we had found the love of our lives within hours. We got to know eachother very well and we basicly spent all the time and just loved every second of it. We could just talk for hours and hours on. we are absolutely crazy for one another and it feels like its the one. Anyways It's story time! This occurred a while ago. Her mom calls my phone because my girlfriend was sick at his ex-house; boyfriend's well, backstory, I had no idea she attempted suicide the day we met, and I was shocked. She had been dumped by her abusive ex boyfriend, and her mother is unaware of all her dark secrets for what her ex did to her; it was so fkin horrible; he hit her and fucked her up, forced her, he dated her when she was 16, she was a fk minor, and he was 25, he destroyed her life and abused her, and he made her his puppet, he is a drug addict and enraged and he only wants sex and he doesn t want her to meet her friends and he force her in to stay in her room, she has been stayed at his room etc too many stories to tell and I\u2019ve helped and i have tried everything to make her the best verison of herself and start doing her passion and learn to appreciate herself, without me being her sole source of happiness and confidence. and her mother find out that they broke up and her mother keeps talking about him and started to try to find reasons for her to not see me. I think that this is largely because they broke up ? just because I am far from her, and just because she is protective ? I find it incredibly odd how prejudiced people, I\u2019ve shown my girlfriend love, helped her become an outgoing person again, and I\u2019ve tutored her with everthing that she hasn t experienced yet and adviced her like therapist, yet her mom doesn\u2019t want me to date her and doesn t like me for no reason bcs she is overprotective. I\u2019m probably the reason that she\u2019s still alive, since she attempted suicide 14 times and self harming before meeting me, and hasn\u2019t since.\n\nI did everything for her to be happy, and it's really too hard, and she suffers every day and I did my best to find herself happiness and love self,\n\nanyway so this week when her ex-boyfriend brought my girlfriend's stuff back to her house and he came home to talk and they both decided to date every weekend just bcs, the other day her ex-boyfriend start talking to her like he's trying to ask her that he changed and they show the pictures of the change in her room and shit ! he is trying to manipulate her, and her friends and me tried to explain her not to come back ! and she was cold and quiet then yesterday before dating him, she sent me a screenshot of him of the date plan, and what he said \"btw nick called me about tmr about the car and i told him that we have plan so if you don t mind i come after work there i get u and nick we bring him back to his city he take his car and we if you don t mind go home so i can take a quick shower and then we go our date to walk if you want we can return after home make some eggs ( cause today i m gonna clean the whole sink no matter how long it takes me) and after i take u back home or something you think you want all that ?\" what actually the fuck this kind of date ? and wtf he wants her ? i told her decline and its a red flag ! and she did and she said that she ll only bring her stuffs and won t see him tonight and start a new life, and this morning her mom asked her go date with him and stop talking with me ? i m so disappointed man, fk this shit her mother is tryna to force her what to do yet she doesn t know nothing about what happened, her friends and her brother hate him about everything but her mom needs to fk understand !\n\nI told her that she shouldn t be sorry and i told her to give her time if her mother start getting some no respect this relationship will not continue i m afraid bcs i rly care about her a lot. This is an unnecessary stress. She of course was devastated.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see why I shouldn't care what her parents think of me. I know my self worth and I know how to achieve what I want. Haters are gonna hate, and maybe I should just accept the fact that they hate me and just live with it. and i don t know how to explain her about her mother i\n\ni ve gone on to long as it is. There is so much more context but it would take forever to explain clearly.

I truly have no desire to be in a relationship , and I don't want kids so nothing to worry about there. I'm not against something casual, or even a relationship if the right man came into my life, but I am SO much happier on my own, doing my own thing and not being accountable to anyone.\n\nSo, now: I met a guy \\[39M\\] through Instagram (we both run similar creator accounts), and he caught my eye as someone I was VERY attracted to. I'm really picky, so this is rare for me. He and I live in different states, but we started flirting more and more until I finally gave him my phone number and snapchat a few weeks ago. I was excited to have a little fun but since then, things have gotten... confusing.\n\nWe both were VERY clear that neither of us is looking for a relationship, just something casual and to have a little fun. But I feel like it's not playing out that way at all. The problem is that I don't know if I'm just a stick in the mud\/too protective of my time, or if he's crossing the line.\n\nIn the beginning, it was really fun to snapchat and get a little more than PG rated. Turns out he is coming to my city next month, which I was really excited about, and we talked about how I could be his tour guide and we even discussed whether he could stay with me if things were going well.\n\nBut lately I've been getting the major ICK. It's three main things, I guess:\n\nFirst, his communication screams \"relationship.\" I literally even called him out and said that I feel like he's trying to fill a void in his life with how much he wants to talk. This man snapchats me ALL. DAY. LONG. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Long ass videos telling me stories about his day. Plus texts. And DMs. All of it. Non stop. Even when I don't respond for hours! There's always a good morning, always a good night. Always asking what I'm up to. Always telling me details about his day, like what he's doing and eating.\n\nHe has also started operating under the assumption that we should talk daily. Every night, it's \"let me know if you're free to talk.\" During the day it's, \"we can talk more about this tonight.\" I feel SO SMOTHERED that now I'm just annoyed every time I get a notification, and the last thing I want to do is talk to this man. I'm so turned off by it!! It also doesn't help that I feel like he's always just lying shirtless in his bed. At first I was like okayyyy hottie, but now I'm like dude can you not sit upright and get some hobbies? He DOES go to the gym daily and does blogging and stuff, but other than that he's always seemingly in bed just waiting for me.\n\nWhich brings me to point #2, which is something that ebbs and flows by the day. Some days, I am incredibly impressed by this guy's emotional openness and ability to be vulnerable and thoughtful. He sent me a handwritten card in the mail that was incredible touching. And he asked about my flower preferences, which like, no man has done ever lol.\n\nBut other days, I feel like we live on two different planets. I work at a prestigious company in corporate America (I'm a former biglaw attorney), and he works in a warehouse managerial-type role in a southern state. I am absolutely NOT snooty about education and careers, but I'm starting to wonder if there is a genuine IQ gap that I can't see past. I feel like I'm talking past this man sometimes. When the conversation turns to anything but sex and food, I find it incredibly unfulfilling, and I'm REALLY confused by what he gets out of it. He has made comments that he really admires my intellect and vocabulary and loves listening to me speak, which is flattering, but it's EXHAUSTING. Like, not only does he want to talk all the time, but the burden is totally on me to entertain him, it seems.\n\nThat brings me to #3, which I definitely think I have some fault in. Since our \"relationship\" started off based on physical attraction, I was very open to the aforementioned not-PG snapchats at first. But it has begun to feel like that is all this man wants to talk about. I'll be talking about something serious or something stressing me out, and his solution is a sexual gesture. He sends me sexual things throughout the day because he thinks it'll bring a smile to my face. And every live conversation turns to how he's so turned on by me and he can't wait to get physical. It's sex, sex, sex ALL THE TIME.\n\nI guess I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on here. When this started, I was TOTALLY down for casual and physical only. However, I thought that would mean some flirty texts here and there and talking MAYBE once a week. Now, it has become this thing where I feel like I am dating him and accountable to him at all times.\n\nI really don't want to be a jerk to this guy, because I do think he means well and he is REALLY sweet, sex talk aside. I just don't know how to get my feelings across in a way that make sense and aren't hurtful to him. He can be really sweet and encouraging, and he always says he \"gets it\" and \"no worries\" when I tell him I'm busy. But then he goes right back into puppy mode.\n\nIs there a way I can clearly and kindly set boundaries? I don't want to like, stomp on a puppy, but is there any way to get the point across or is it a pointless endeavor? The fact that he's coming to my city is also looming... I definitely think we could have a good time together for a weekend, but I really don't want to put this much effort into this every day.\n\nI also would love validation that I'm not just an asshole or there's something wrong with me. I'm sure a lot of women who would LOVE a no-string-attached situationship where the guy is sweet and doting and hot. It makes me feel like there is just something wrong with me that I am this frustrated...\n\nThoughts, advice, insights?!\n\nTL;DR: Am I prickly pear who just shouldn't date at all, or is this guy crossing the line?","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678488061.0},{"title":"I (23f) don't think my relationship is going to work out in the long run with my girlfriend (26f) , what do I do?","author":"unrestrained-egg","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11ohn8m\/i_23f_dont_think_my_relationship_is_going_to_work\/","text":"I (23f) started dating this lovely kind woman (26f) in October last year.

I am 25F and he is 26M (and currently a family doctor medical resident). In December 2022, we agreed that we were exclusive. We both got our STI tests done so that we could begin having unprotected sex together. Come mid-January 2023, he went out of town and stayed with a friend. After going out to the bar with his friends, he came back with a girl and had sex with her on his friend's couch. He said it wasn't originally his intention, and that his friends had brought her and her friends back to continue the party. But eventually, around 4am, only her and him were left awake and he decided to initiate having sex with her. He said that after they had started having sex and he realized what he was doing, he felt very guilty, got soft, and the sex ended. He drove her home early the next morning. That morning, he had texted me at 8am telling me about a detailed \"wild night\" he had, leaving out the cheating.\n\nOnce he came back to town a few days later, we had unprotected sex together, as usual. He didn't suggest using a condom and he didn't get re-tested for STIs since having had sex with the random girl from the bar - taking the chance of risking my heath to keep his secret because he decided the risk was minimal. At this point we had been dating for 3-months so I pushed that we needed to make the decision of whether we were going to put a label on us, or go our separate ways. He had assumed up until this point that we wouldn't get this far. However, after some deep conversations, we decided to take the next step together and became officially boyfriend and girlfriend in February 2023. At this point, he had never had a serious girlfriend before and had only sought out casual FWB relationships before me. He didn't think we would likely end up becoming official, but serious feelings ended up developing for him.\n\nNow, in March 2023, I started having suspicions that he had a secret. I asked him, \"is there something you need to tell me?\". Eventually, he started crying and admitted that he cheated on me in January while we were suppose to be exclusive. He said he couldn't remember if he used a condom. I was horrified and immediately broke up with him and went to go get an STI test done the next day. After a few days, I reached out to him to get answers and he said he does remember the whole thing and that he did use a condom. So, that implies that he wasn't that drunk and he clearly knew better. He said that he doesn't understand why he did what he did, that he is extremely remorseful, and now realizes that he loves me - a feeling he had never experienced for a romantic partner before.\n\nI feel extremely betrayed that not only did he cheat on me and not immediately tell me, but that he also took the chance in risking my sexual health because he didn't want me to find out. As a doctor, he felt that the risk of him having contracted an STI was minimal, and therefore my risk was minimal.\n\nAt this point, we are broken up. He is currently seeking therapy and wants to do everything in his power to make it work. I don't know what to do. On one hand, I believe his feelings are genuine for me and our relationship once it had become official had been amazing - as for the cheating, we weren't technically official yet and he assumed it wouldn't work out when he did it. But on the other hand, he disrespected me while we were exclusive and made a decision about my health on my behalf and we hadn't even been official for a month.\n\nTL;DR: What is reasonable to do?

I am a woman somewhere from the SEA. We are now 1 year and 1 month old.He has a business and ,I am a Juris Doctor degree holder, currently unemployed while waiting for the bar results to be released. I am currently unemployed because I thought I should enjoy the things I was not able to do during my review like driving school, netflix and etc. So compared to my boyfriend who works daily (except on weekends), I have so much time on my hands. For some maybe MBTI matters...I am an INTJ-T and he is an ENFP.\n\nI met my boyfriend in an app last December 2021. We became an LDR couple by January 2022. He came to my country around June of the same year to meet me. I promised to go to his country but at that time I was busy preparing for my bar exam.\n\nMy boyfriend is sweet and he shares lots of theories and scientific stuff with me. I appreciated it much as it was the first that\u00a0 met someone who is not creepy. He was very vocal about his feelings and never failed to say ILY to me. I am an introvert and I have been with men who found it cringey whenever I try to express my love for them. So I felt relieved that my boyfriend did not feel that way towards me. Me and my boyfriend both got cheated on. And he is very vocal about his feelings of being cynical about everyone. And we were open about being married to each other. Personally, I am a person who has a mindset of \u201cI date to marry.\u201d\n\nMy Bar was in November of 2022. The whole month. By December, I planned to go to Korea. However, things happened and I got kicked out of the house. My money that was supposed to be for my Korean trip got depleted big time. I felt he was disappointed. Me too. We have not meet each other again since June of 2022. So we usually spend time watching netflix via a streaming site we we could talk to each other via audio or chat.\n\nJanuary 2023 came. I felt like he grew cold to me.I was alarmed at first but I thought maybe he was just busy with work.\n\nFebruary arrived and things got worse. He started acting mean to me sometimes, gave me sarcastic replies and has low tolerance whenever we argue.\n\nHe told me that if I really want to watch movies with him, I should just ask him if I really really want it. Before, I would ask him if he is free to watch with me. He would get annoyed a bit and would say WHY ARE YOU DOUBTING ME?YOU KNOW MY SCHEDULE. OF COURSE I AM FREE. Right now, while watching netflix, the mood would just change. I would feel like he is cranky or tired. And whenever I joke he would get mad. SO i stopped asking him to spend time with me sometimes. I thought maybe i should just wait for him to invite me to watch netlflix when he is a in a good mood.\n\nWe always argue about the small and big stuff. Sometimes, I would praise him and maybe because of language barrier, he would take it as an insult and get mad at me. My boyfriend has a good level of English. I am from a country where English is a second language and is often used more than the native one. So I tried to use simpler terms mostly.\n\nBefore, when he does not understand something, he would ask me for clarification. I would explain to him and he would understand it. No arguments at all. But now it feels like he became a war freak with me. One time I complimented him while we were watching a movie using a streaming app. After I gave him a compliment, he went silent. I am extra sensitive so I know what happens even though he is in Korea. So I asked him what happened. He merely replied with a NEVER MIND. I thought he really got angry with my innocent praise and maybe he misunderstood it so I tried explaining it to him. I sent my explanation and he replied with an IDC. I thought that was childish of him.\n\nBefore, when we would argue, we would fix the problem on the spot. Whenever he feels that I have a problem, he would tell me that I can always tell him whatever it is. As an introvert, I am so used to dealing with my problems all by myself. Even in my past relationships, the men were not worried enough to ask me how I feel. I felt happy because my boyfriend is thoughtful. However, in December of 2022, we had an argument while streaming a movie together. I told him I was feeling worried about something. He said that feeling was RIDICULOUS. It was the first time he told me that. Usually, he would be welcoming most of my thoughts and never gaslighted me.\n\nAfter that, I noticed he now has a low tolerance for entertaining my drama about life and about other people. He would say YOU ARE BEING NEGATIVE AGAIN or YOU ARE ALWAYS LIKE THAT. One time I told him how people around me would insult me right to my face. They would directly tell me negative comments and etc. Even people who I did not know insulted me. I told that to him. I thought I could get an emotional support from him. But he said THAT IS YOUR SUFFERING. YOU ARE ALWAYS PREDICTING THAT PEOPLE THINK NEGATIVELY OF YOU. Why am I predicting? Those people insulted me directly and verbally. I got disappointed.\n\nMe and boyfriend operate on a \u201croutine basis\u201d. There are specific hours where he would text and I would reply. In other words, predictable. We never failed to text everyday and watch Netflix every night after his work. For over a year that we were talking, I unconsciously memorized his routine. Maybe that is the same for him too. Last year, after studying, I fell asleep for 3 hours. When I woke up he was angry because I did not reply to him immediately. One time, I spent my whole afternoon editing my CV and resume for job hunting. He got mad because I did not reply immediately. Those happened while we were still 2 or three months in the relationship. I thought he was too clingy. To avoid dramas, I tried to reply to him as fast as I could.I would set my notifications at a higher volume.\n\nThis February, there were times he would deviate from his usual routine. As someone who got used to his schedule, I got curious at first. But then the deviation continued and I got worried. One time he texted me that he arrived home from his work after the afternoon of not talking to me. I asked him if he wants to watch Netflix. He did not reply and just sent Insta reels. I thought it was rude. I told him that it was rude because I did not receive any messages from him that afternoon and he would just ignore me without answering my question. I wanted an explanation for his behavior that night. But he called me as being OBSESSED about his time and life.I thought maybe at that time I should call him obsessed too for being angry with me numerous times in the past just because I did not reply for an hour or so. He said he got rly busy at work. It feels like whenever we argue, I lose my existence. He can ignore me for very loongggg hours now. No texts from 11Am until the evening.\n\nThe worse thing that had happened to him since February was he started accusing me of a lot of stuff. In my country, wifi being slow is a normal thing. So for a Korean who can download a movie within 30mins, that is weird. For us, in my country, it has already become a joke how our wifi or data can be real slow even if our wifi provider is the best one in the nation. So mostly, during our Netflix time, I would UNINTENTIONALLY go OFFLINE or LEAVE our streaming room because I got disconnected explained to him about the wifi situation in the country. One night I got disconnected. After a few minutes, the wifi got restored and I went back to the streaming site.I talked to him there but he did not reply even though he was still online.The next day, he ignored me the entire afternoon.He said he did not trust my excuse about my wifi disconnection and that I was just playing him.When I finally sent him a screenshot showing the disconnection, he just said OH with sad emoji. He ignored me for that only. I told him I got really hurt by what he did,for immediately thinking bad about me instead of asking me about what happened. He never apologized for it.\n\nEvery time I would reply late or deviate from the hours I would usually send him a reply, he would ask me if I was ghosting him. He does not trust me anymore I think.\n\nI couldn\u2019t count anymore last February how many times I cried just because he ignored because of a thing that can be settled with a proper talk, or how many times I felt he expressed his distrust towards me, or how many times he accused me of doing things behind his back, or how many times he told me harsh stuff. I told him a lot of times that if he does not love me then he does not need to date me and that he should let me go. But he did not.\n\nLast Saturday, he told me how he trusted me more before and that he is having doubts about his future with me. I got annoyed by it. I felt fear. My degree is something that is inflexible when taken outside of my own country. He wants to move to Canada and I want live abroad too. That means I would be going with him. But the thing is, if I go abroad, job offers would be limited. If I want to put my law degree in use, I would have to start from scratch again or enroll in a university again. Moreover, I am an only child who is not close to her relatives. My parents are old now. That means I would be living in abroad all by myself with him.And I have a dream of building a happy family. My parents are annulled. So most of my life I have to spend events in two houses and whenever I graduate, I could only bring one of them on stage because they hate each other. So I want a different life where I can grow old with my husband.\n\nHe always told me before that I should stay with him. That is what I did. Even though I got insults from him, he treated me meanly sometimes or he accuses me of things,\u2026I stayed. For someone like me who usually can cut ties easily once treated badly, I was surprised myself that I stayed long. I really want him. That I am sure of.So when he said he is doubting his future with me, I felt scared about the possibilities like being left alone in Canada, or being divorced by him, or being left to care for the children all by myself, or that I would regret that I would be sacrificing my bright future.\n\nThe next day (Sunday) he greeted me with a good morning as usual, sent insta reels like usual. I felt annoyed when I woke up. It feels like he was not concerned of what he said the night before about our future, while me\u2026I did not know where to place myself. He just acted normally that day.\n\nAs an avid planner, I always think long-term. Going to Canada with him will not be an easy feat. *(Before I met him, I actually wanted to pursue Master's in Switzerland)* I did some research and it seems that I would be taking a year worth of law classes there again and be assessed by some Board to get accredited to practice law. I started looking for Canadian universities even. I was planning to move full force once I pass my bar this coming April. I was even preparing to review for the IELTS. And now he is saying he doubts his future with me? I just got really mad last Sunday. So I proposed that what if we start thinking about breaking up.\n\nHe does not trust me and he doubts his future with me, and yet he says he loves me and demands me to stay beside him. I promised to stay by his side but when he told me his doubts about our future together, is there really a reason for me to stay? I am gambling a lot of things while thinking of having a future with him and he is just acting like normal.\n\nI proposed that we should start thinking about breaking up. I explained my side as to how I want to fight for the relationship but I cannot do it alone if I am the only one trusting and thinking positive about our future. He just replied with a **DO WHATEVER YOU WANT**. It felt like he does not care if we\u2019ll be together, and he does not care if we break up. I wanted us to have a heartfelt convo at the time. Should we break up or not? Discuss our sides, our thoughts, and what we want from each other. After much discussion, we can arrive at an agreement whether to really break up or not. But he just replied with a DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. For me, it reflected of how less he cares for our relationship. Because I got mad with his reply, I blocked him on Instagram. Before blocking him, our convo on insta was open-ended. No agreement as to whether we should break up or not.However, when I checked his profile, I honestly felt\u00a0shocked\u00a0when it showed that we automatically unfollowed each other and that I had to request to follow him again.I felt\u00a0*OH SH\\*T*. I have been blocking people in the past, but I did not realize that that would be the effect since I don't visit the accounts of the people that I blocked before. I don't care much about the number of my FOLLOWS and FOLLOWERS so I really don't keep track of the numbers- whether they are increasing or decreasing.\u00a0\n\nI thought,\u00a0*\"Maybe I should leave it as it is. Maybe he will understand because he used to deactivate his accounts in the past too whenever we would argue.\"*\u00a0I failed to see that BLOCKING is harsher than deactivation.\u00a0\n\nAfter that I thought I should use the time away from him to think about our relationship. That Monday, I checked Insta again and his account disappeared; either he blocked me too or deactivated.So I sent a message using Imessage to ask if he was ready to talk about the proposal. He replied that he hopes I can find a new love and a bright future and to not remember him etc etc etc. At first, I got confused. We were just gonna talk about our thoughts about the proposal. I tried to tell him that we can talk and fix things to which he replied *I NEED TIME BY MYSELF.* I thought what he meant was he needs more time alone to think about my proposal. He said that if I say one more word, he will delete me and that he is suffering from the painful break up. That is where I understood what happened. Maybe he thought I was breaking up with him. And my blocking made his overthinking worse.\n\nI hurriedly replied to him that there is a misunderstanding and that there is no break up yet and that my proposal was just LITERALLY about thinking of the possibility to break up.But I dunno if he was able to read that message. I believe he has two phones. But until now (Saturday- 5 days after he thought I broke up with him) he has not replied yet.\n\nLast Monday, I just wanted to tell him about my decision about the possibility of breaking up. I wanted to tell him that we can still fix things and we can try continuing but we should realize our faults without gaslighting each other. But because of my proposal and my subsequent blocking, maybe he thinks we have broken up for good. The last message I sent to him on Imessage was telling him that there was a misunderstanding and that I will give him time and I will wait for him.\n\nI don\u2019t know. I am confused as well. He thinks we have broken up, but on my part we have not yet. I am even confused as to whether am I the dumper or is he the dumper?I don\u2019t know how long should I wait for him. My male friends told me to give him time to calm and if he really loves me much, he would talk to me. But I should be prepared for whatever he is going to say.\n\nI am worried because he thinks we have broken up. The only thing he has to do is to just move on. While on my part, I am not sure if I should just move on or wait for him.\n\nI am still on DELIVERED on Imessage. So he has not blocked me yet. His accounts on the streaming app are still there with the nicknames that I gave him as his usernames. His kakao account is still there with my avatar as his profile picture and a day counter ever since we became a couple (But I feel like he has another kakao account). We talked on insta more because we could send cat memes and cat reels easily.\n\nShould I let him have his time? Maybe because he thinks we have broken up, he would date someone else or he would realize that I am actually a NO GOOD for him? Or should I continue to find a way to reach out to him so he can cut his agony short about this \"break up\" and we can fix things immediately.\n\nTL;DR! We had a miscommunication. He thinks I have broken up with him. But I really did not. Now he is not talking to me and I don't know what to do.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678510594.0},{"title":"Does this friend of mine like me romantically?","author":"MysteriousAd3979","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11okge4\/does_this_friend_of_mine_like_me_romantically\/","text":" \n\nOkay.

Besides this one problem, she's  absolutely fantastic. Marriage material. Yes, there's an age gap here -  but I don't think that is the issue unless we're talking about emotional  maturity. We're currently at 2+ years, and I'm very happy with her.\n\nThe problem is - if I  am experiencing any stress in my life, she breaks down in tears, and then rather than being able to focus on my problems, I have to focus on  her.\n\nThese are actually major problems, which I also view as opportunities.\n\nProblem  1: I'm finishing up a divorce after a long separation. Believe it or  not, this has NOT been stressful for me. Sure, it's expensive. But I  view ending a toxic and abusive relationship as opening the door on new  possibilities. I'm genuinely excited and happy about it. I haven't shed a  single tear.\n\nHowever, when I talk to my lawyer on the phone in front of her, or discuss custody issues, she breaks down and sobs. I then have to change gears and talk her  through MY problems, instead of being able to deal with anything for a  day or two.\n\nProblem 2: I was laid  off on Tuesday. Yes, this is stressful. But, I'll probably have a job on  Monday. I can't see myself being out of work for more than a week or  two. I work in consulting, which means my job is mostly establishing  good business relationships with people. When people heard I was laid  off and available, my inbox was flooded. I'm excited to start something  new and to make more money. I have savings to fall back on, so I am not  worried at all.\n\nToday she broke  down in the car and started sobbing. I had to take her home, because  while I am optimistic about things, I don't have to emotional space or  time to cater to her concerns about MY major problems.\n\nOn  top of these two issues, I'm also looking to move into a new place.  She's stressed about this, I'm not. I currently live in a small  apartment...this will be a very easy move since I don't have much stuff  at the moment.\n\nBackground: She comes from a home where she was neglected by her parents. She moved out  when she was 18. She is on a couple of anti-depressants. If she misses a  day or two of her medication she cries uncontrollably. I came from  stable home, and I am not on any medications. I am older than her, and  she, in a way, leans on me for the emotional support and stability she  never had. I am very OK with this, but sometimes I have my own problems that I need to focus on, and sometimes I view her crying as sucking all  the emotional energy out of the room. I feel like she's making my  problems her problems, and I feel, in a more practical way, that she is making it harder for me to deal with major life problems.\n\nQuestion:  Is she just empathetic? Is she narcissistic (I don't think so)? Is she  viewing my problems as shared \"couple problems\"? Am I selfish to want to  be able to focus on very important issues without getting constantly  sidetracked to comfort her? Also, how much can people reference or lean  on their trauma to excuse their behavior? I know people don't just \"get  over it\", but using it as an excuse for everything isn't OK either.\n\nAfter today's crying incident, I told her I needed to be away from her for  the day without any texting, which she will probably take very hard.  Like I said, I am very optimistic about things, but I just couldn't deal  with her anymore today.\n\nTLDR; When I experience a major life problem, my girlfriend has a breakdown which causes me to lose focus so I can comfort her.","upvote_ratio":0.35,"created_utc":1678570061.0},{"title":"I fell in love with my wife's girlfriend and now I'm miserable.","author":"Far-Day4119","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11ox0bo\/i_fell_in_love_with_my_wifes_girlfriend_and_now\/","text":"18 months ago my M40 wife H F39 suggested we date another woman. Wasn't a supprise as I always knew she was bi. She has always jumped from 1 thing to another so I figured she was looking for something.\n\nSo we joined some apps and she gets speaking to a woman K F40. They went out & it was nice to see her happy. I love H & thought this was something that I couldn't give her.\n\nH then put me in contact. I though at this point I'd be a third wheel, I was wrong, it was electric.\n\nIt all happened quickly, we all dated, we hung out, our kids went on play dates we were doing DIY. In couple of weeks we were sleeping together and in a month we were starting to come out to friends. It was intense, but it was magic. K and I had a connection that was unreal &I fell head over heels.\n\nI dont blame H for being jealous but I saw a different side to her. K was trying to make it work but things just got worse until I had to break things off. I was gutted. What was worse was I couldn't see H the same way.\n\nI didn't sleep for days and I asked H for a break to think about things. I was so angry & questioned everything. H always got her way again and again, I struggled to think of anything I'd had control of in years, all the frustration just snapped.\n\nThen I fucked up. I needed some relief and somebody who understood, and I just fell into K.\n\nOver those months I must have broken things off with K 6 or 7 times, but it kept going back & at the same time I'd told H I wanted to separate. Things got nasty.\n\nH was talked about killing herself and had to go on meds, I got counciling, K became a mess, but worst of all our kids were suffering and that killed me.\n\nI love K but it must have been torture. I wish I'd have manned up at the beginning but I kept hurting her. So I stopped.\n\nH ballanced out. What was happening to my family broke me, so I agreed to try to work things out, but I told H what had happened with K, we couldn't carry on with that hanging over us.\n\nH was upset. I didn't want to push her over the edge so didn't confess everything, but the worst of it. Call it cowardly, but I just wanted to keep a part for me. She pushed for every detail, but I had to draw a line and hope we could move on.\n\nThat was a year ago. I've not seen K since. Its not been easy, but the kids are doing much better and H's mental health is on the up.\n\nThe problem is I'm not over it. I miss K & the way she made me feel, more like me rather than the person I pretend to be. I can't help but ask what if that was it. My chace at 'the 1'.\n\nI can't rip my family apart and cause any more hurt. So here I am, miserable and fucked. This is my story, a guy that got pulled apart and is trying to hold it together. Any advice?\n\nTLDR my wife (F39) & I (M40) started dating another woman (F40), we fell in love and my wife got jealous and it all ended badly. I almost left her, but I ended up patching this up.

I am disabled (heart condition, fibromyalgia, anemia) and I have borderline personality disorder and agoraphobia. I very rarely leave my home the last time I went out was probably about 2 months ago now, I do everything online. I have no friends and my family rarely contact me and due to trauma growing up it's hard for me to talk to them about the weather let alone my general feelings on anything at all. I am overweight, I had to have most of teeth out due to the fact I got so depressed after my last break up I would sleep all day and not wash or make proper food for myself let alone brush my teeth, I hate how I look I think I am physically repulsive especially now I'm overweight and have lost most of my teeth and wear dentures, I have support workers who come each day for an hour who I love so much. It's physically and mentally difficult for to leave my home.\n\nRelationship background info:\nMe and my boyfriend have been together 7 months I have previously been in a 4 year long relationship (20-24) and it's cliche asf but I have never felt this way about anyone or even come close for that matter, I love him with everything I have. On November 19 2022 he came to mine really drunk and he immediately started screaming at me because I asked him to sleep on the couch instead of in my bed or I would sleep on the couch and he could have my bed, I remember him putting his arms around my neck (I'm 5'10  and overweight and he's 5'3 and skinny) he jumped up and I fell on top of him he wouldn't get off me straight away then I screamed at him to leave and I called the police and he was arrested, the police said he was abusive and narcissistic I didn't make a statement or press charges but he got an order put in place (DVPO) and he couldn't see me for 30 days. We got back together and we've been pretty happy but he told me the night of him attacking me I had got it wrong and he can't believe I did that to him and he was in a police cell for 24 hours which has traumatised him he was making me feel so guilty and due to my fibro I have memory problems so I thought I got it wrong and believed him, he hasn't hurt me physically since then but he has been very manipulative and emotionally abusive.\n\n\nThe attack which happened 3 days ago:\nI had my support and he isn't allowed to be here when they are for insurance purposes and because he didn't live with me they won't pay for him to have a criminal record check. He hates the majority of them (2\/3) despite me really liking them. He went to the pub for a drink with a mutual friend whilst she was here and he said he'd be an hour he was there for 3+ hours and we got into an argument because he was trying to pressure me into inviting our mutual friend home so they could probably get more drunk and I kept saying no. But he said he wasn't pressuring me (he asked me 3 times after the first time I said no) I decided to voice record when he came home because I was anxious about his return. He started screaming at me the moment I disagreed with me and he put his hand around the back of my neck and the other scarily close to my throat until I screamed, he went into the back room and I asked him to leave calmly as he was screaming at me, he refused so I took his phone and put it outside so he would leave, as I was going to the door he was grabbing and pushing me back and throwing me on the floor I was desperate to make it to the door and as he was grabbing me I screamed help at the top of my lungs and my neighbours from upstairs immediately came to help and got him off me. He left on foot. They didn't call the police as I begged them not too.\n\nSince the incident:\nHe's assuming we will get back together and he has my key, if I get upset about what I did he refuses to come and post my key through my door or get his Mother (who hates me) too atleast. I am feeling terrified to tell the police because he's telling me he will get me arrested for 'lying' to the police last time and I'm black mailing him for my key because I've said I'll call the police to get it back if he doesn't give it back by tonight. My support workers manager for safeguarding reasons had to call the police which he did 2 days ago but they are yet to even call me. \n\n\nPlease stop me going back to him, I just feel like if I don't go back to him I'm going to be alone of the rest of my life and spend 24 hours a day all day by myself.","upvote_ratio":0.36,"created_utc":1678555044.0},{"title":"My (36F) boyfriend (41M) chose weekend chores over visiting my family.","author":"destinationxreached","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11or6u0\/my_36f_boyfriend_41m_chose_weekend_chores_over\/","text":"My (36F) boyfriend (41M) chose weekend chores over visiting my family. \n\nBackground: We\u2019re together a year and a half; both divorced.

Most people kind of look awkwardly and don\u2019t know what to do, so I was very impressed that he did that without hesitation. \n\nHe is quite a troubled person outside of school. A lot of personal and interpersonal problems, but he never ever shows that in front of his students and I had a lot of respect for that. \n\nOver time, I started noticing that he would occasionally have pretty sharp comments. At first, it seemed okay and justifiable since I also saw how it could be frustrating. It was still a bit jolting since he would get pretty loud and vindictive as we\u2019re walking down the street (we\u2019re in a big city), but I let it slide. I guess he\u2019s getting comfortable with me, which I really appreciate. \n\nA couple of months ago, we got into a minor miscommunication regarding a certain guest we were inviting. I did not intend it to be taken seriously, I meant to say what I did in the most light hearted manner. I\u2019m a sarcastic person. But he didn\u2019t take it as such, and he snapped at me saying that he really needs to focus on this event this week. He was getting upset in the middle of a busy city, so I immediately apologized and focused on diffusing the situation. He must have  noticed how I responded to the outburst, as he quickly changed his demeanor and started to overcompensate that he\u2019s fine and he\u2019s relaxed. This incident really changed how I viewed him up to that point. But I also understood why he was really stressed, so again, I let it slide.\n\nA couple weeks pass by, and we find out that our event materials were missing two days before the event. I did tell him the situation, and his response was \u201csomeone must\u2019ve stolen it.\u201d Right in front of the students. For context, this was not something common, it was definitely a reach to think someone stolen it. But again, it was a stressful time. \n\nMore weeks pass by, and I didn\u2019t really come across overt aggression until yesterday. Not to me, but to another colleague. We had a department meeting this past Wednesday, and during the meeting a colleague had spoken a bit too much. Anyone who\u2019s been in meetings would know, there\u2019s always one person who goes on a tangent and the conversation just keeps going on and on. To me, I felt that yeah it was long but it was a through report and we had good laughs. I didn\u2019t think of it much until he brought it up yesterday.\n\nThe topic of the meeting was brought up, and he began mentioning how draining it was. Which then I agreed, it was long. He kept going, and proceeded to say the following:\n\u201cIt was *insufferable.* It was just too much. A good 80% of it wasn\u2019t even about the topic. It was *terrible.* I can\u2019t believe someone can be that that way. I wish I *never* become someone like that.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t remember exact word for word, but that was the gist of it. He went on a full rant about this new faculty member, which I actually like because she\u2019s so sweet. He was again, doing this in the middle of the street and I was a little concerned about onlookers so I tried to diffuse it without invalidating his emotions. Rest of our hangout was fun and all, but that alarmed me because this was the first time I\u2019ve heard him actively bad mouth someone for something pretty benign and harmless imo. \n\nI guess the question is, is this just how people are? Should I be careful moving forward with my personal involvements with him? Is it a red flag? I have mixed feelings because I\u2019m happy he\u2019s opening up to me, but I\u2019m just not someone who gets pressed like that with people in general so it\u2019s hard to understand.\n\nTldr; Colleague who I thought was a generally nice person bad mouthed another colleague for something I think is benign, and I don\u2019t know if I should reevaluate my relationship with him.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678517430.0},{"title":"I [31F] met a guy [38M] who I really like.

I have met a lot of people on it and have generally had a good time. About half a year ago I met this girl on said game who I became friends with. This was more than just friends because we would frequently call for hours whole playing another video game since we had gaming consoles. She lives across the world from me but timezones aren't a problem because I ruined my sleep schedule to be able to call her for hours in the night. Since we called a lot and we're generally flirty with eachother, we had grown a reputation of liking eachother amongst our friend group and people persuaded me to ask her to be my girlfriend. After some weeks of being dumb struck in love, I asked her to be my online girlfriend and after she thought it was a joke and gossiped about it, she said yes. Things seemed great since we already talked a lot and liked eachother it felt so what would be the issue? Won't we just like eachtoehr more and be even closer now? That's what I was thinking but recently it has gone down hill in my opinion. I noticed this blemish when I was roasted by a mutual that my girlfriend never says she loves me at all. This is true and I soon noticed she was never really loving towards me at all. It was mainly me being sweet towards her and her being kinda disgusted about it in a way. She never reciprocated lovng me and I am noticing this now. She is also not really nice in general, having her humor telling me to go die whenever I jokingly jab her for something. She also gets upset over things sometimes and will ignore me for a day and then come back to texting me the next acting like Nothing hapend or telling me I upset her. I realized that I am gaining nothing out of this other than pain and worry that I am messing it up in some way. I feel like she doesn't love me at all. I don't want to say this to her for fear that she might either brush it off, attack me, leave me, or slowly stop talkjg to me. Whenever we call recently which Is less than before, it is almost silent except for video game callouts. I dont know if I've just lost feelings or if she has instead.. She also has this other guy friend that says he loves her sometimes whether it's on her snapchat story or over instagram notes. I have told her that it's not ok for another guy to tell her he loves her when she is with me, but he answered for her since he was logged in on her snap and said there is nothing to worry about . She did not defend me at all and actually laughed over text and then simply brushed it off. She has even ditched me at some point to play with him online while we we're on our mediocre near silent call. Idk if I'm being jealous or paranoid in any way so pls tell me. I do not want to tell anyone this in fear of getting outed or ostracized by the friend group since there are a lot of snitches and I feel she would likely just leave me if I tell her this. Since she is not the affectionate type, I don't expect her to reassure me in any way, but rather tell other people about my insecurity. I feel if I leave her instead, I would be crucified by the friend group as well for upsetting her. I feel trapped and Idk what to do. What should I do?

At the moment, I don't feel like this situation is that deep tbh, but I'm trying to ask for opinions on this.\n\nSo I have a college friend group consisting of around 5-6 guys including myself. They're the ones I met in my freshman year right before Covid strikes and everything went lockdown. So during our first couple of months when everything was still physical in early 2020, our situations (living the dorm life) are the same. But fast forward after almost 2 years of lockdown, a lot has changed.\n\nWe were still great friends during online classes and have group projects together since we all take the same course, but the difference is, especially for me, starting from 2022-now,  I work and study at the same time. Also I have my license, a car and I live in a house. Another guy in the group, lets call him A, is the other one who almost has the same situation except he does not have a job. Others go back to the dorm life again similar to how it was before.\n\nNow for the group chat, we created a discord group to hang out and a group chat to talk to each other\/send memes etc\u00b2 back in 2020 during our freshmen year. Over the course of the online sessions as well, we used the same group chat. But after the lockdown ended, those who live on campus created a separate group chat called \"on campus\" presumably for them to chat everything involving those who stay there (since I don't). But A who does not stay on campus was also in this group chat. Let's just say, it's the exact copy of our group chat, just without me.\n\nNow I can understand why A is in the group chat though, since he is always bored staying alone, he likes to hangout (sometimes even stay the night) in their dorm rooms on campus. So logically thinking that might be the reason I'm the only one not in that. But of course I do feel a little bit left out. Since the new group was created, the group chat we used to talk on is more quiet. Unless I say something and they reply, or it's something that has to do with me, then they don't really chat here anymore.\n\nWhat bothers me is, they know that I know about that group chat. I don't really count this as the 'they got caught' moment, but I found out about the group pretty \"openly\". It was not like they were being secretive about it. Just one day one of the guys said hey look at what (insert name) said, and he showed me the group chat. He acknowledged that I'm not in it so he had to show whatever the news\/joke was to me. So it genuinely made me confused as do they really just have another group chat just to not bother me?\n\nNow moving to the 'being used' part, this might be a stretch. But nonetheless I'll tell you guys why I feel that way. So we studied in quite a big campus, getting from the dorms to class takes a long time and energy. Usually, A will take them\/be the driver for the group taking them from one place to another without needing to walk or take the campus shuttle. I'm the other guy with the car I guess. So some other time, maybe like 2 times in a week, I am the guy that gives the group a ride to class and cruise around as well. But of course, since I am more busy than the others, I usually just head straight out of the campus after class. I know this is nothing (hence why I think it's stretch), but I feel like it becomes sort of like a chore cause I would need to bring them around in my car and be early to catch them in the morning.\n\nLast but not least, I'm gonna explain the 'hanging out' situation of the group. I tend to not join a lot of them since I'm busy, but now a lot of their plans to hang out possibly at the cinema\/to go out into town are all already planned without me in the other group chat. Of course A will be the one taking them everywhere. The times I am available though, they sometimes might ask each other randomly in the open like \"So what time is it tomorrow?\" And I had to ask about what's going on tomorrow, and then they would invite me on the spot if I wanna go. Unless it's something I invite them to, it's almost certain I'm not invited. But I believe that could be because of me always saying I'm busy to go out with them before.\n\nTo conclude, they are friends who I actually need to get through college. They aren't the ones who do stupid shit, we study a lot together and most of the time I am the type to need company especially for the studies. They focused on their study rather than others like partying and stuff so I personally fit in well with them. Are they genuinely friends with me or is there something else going on behind me? \n\nI have also thought before, could it be that they see me as the friend who is only there for the classes\/studies, but not outside of it? \n\ntl;dr!\n\nCollege group friends have a separate group chat excluding me (with reasons) and I'm usually not invited to hang outs. I fit in well with them though.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678455768.0},{"title":"(advice) can hardly leave the house with my partner due to jealousy","author":"itdoesnthavetobe96","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11ofcew\/advice_can_hardly_leave_the_house_with_my_partner\/","text":"Tldr: i have extreme jealous feelings when I catch my partner looking at other women \n\n\nHey all, \n\nReally needing some tips or advice here.\n\nI (25F) have extreme difficulty with jealousy.

I\u2019m from the east coast and he\u2019s from the west where we currently are. He got a job a few months back and had to move to California. At the time I didn\u2019t go with him cause we weren\u2019t sure of the situation so we\u2019ve been long distance. It\u2019s come to a point where we are sure we want to live together and both see a future which has been discussed. \n\nSo this is where the drama comes in: I planned a trip out to visit and look at apartments together. We were super organized and ended up seeing some perfect places. \n\nLater one night while I was out there I had some sort of anxiety attack; started freaking out from the idea of moving to California. I was so back and fourth about moving all the sudden, even questioning my future with him. I was having super negative thoughts about him and the whole situation that I completely shut down the rest of the trip. I did talk to him about it cause he could tell something was off. I basically told him I\u2019m not sure of moving anymore, that it was all so much and a huge commitment. I wouldn\u2019t just be moving down the street, this would be to an entirely different state the farthest I can get from my family. He has friends there and I would have nothing, not even a job. These are things I told him and that we should wait. That I need more time. \n\nAnother factor of my confusion was that I thought we were on the same page about a timeline. We\u2019ve had our eye on Colorado for some time now and we talked about how this job is most likely a year before we try to move on to CO. Ugh It broke my heart to hear him say he loves his job, he was so happy I could see it. He had friends and basically a second family in CA too, I don\u2019t ever want to rip him away from that. I didn\u2019t bring this part up to him because it just sounds selfish. I have this idea that once I\u2019m there and a year goes by, this may become an argument and I\u2019d be stuck. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve talked with family and friends I just don\u2019t think I want to live there, I have thoughts of going back east constantly. Then there\u2019s my idea of moving to Colorado and honestly CA is just not on my list. I don\u2019t want to give up on our relationship, but it almost feels like if I made the move I\u2019m giving up on what I want for myself. LDR is rough so if I don\u2019t make the move we will probably have to end it.\n\nHas anyone been through this? I need advice.\n\nTD\/LR!\nI don\u2019t think I want to move to California with my boyfriend. I love him and see a future, but don\u2019t want to completely give up what I want in return.

My grandmother is 76. My mother is 56. I am married and have 4 year old son. \n\nMy mother and I have had issues since I was a child. I remember her being very sweet at times, attentive, always made sure I didn\u2019t have drugs, alcohol, or random men around. \n\nI also remember some disturbing things, things that now as a parent myself, I can fathom doing or saying. I remember her getting very angry, saying she hated being a mother, should\u2019ve had an abortion of me, I was a little b***h, wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, I\u2019m the reason her ex didn\u2019t want her back, wishes she never had kids and did her life different. \n\nI was about 7-10 years old when she said these things. I remember going to *elementary school* in tears sometimes in the morning when she would drop me off. I remember asking her why she was nice to other people minutes after belittling me to the point I was crying my eyes out. \n\nWe lived with my grandma some growing up because my mother never made enough money to pay all the bills. I remember huge fights breaking out constantly. My grandma and mom would sometimes get into physical altercations. Mom would throw something or grandma would throw something down the stairs. \n\nOnce on vacation, everyone got so upset (I was about 9) my grandma wanted to jump out of a moving car. \n\n\nI believe my mother had some issues. I got pregnant at 18, moved out at 19. My husband and her have a non existent relationship.\n\nMy husband and I also have terrible marriage issues (I went from one bad situation to another). \n\nMy mom started asking for money constantly. She doesn\u2019t work, and hasn\u2019t in about 5 years. She claims it\u2019s because she\u2019s too sick to work but then at other times says \u201cwell I can get a job, maybe 25 hours a week with no problem\u201d. She was denied her disability when she applied. \n\nSo right now, my grandma pays every single bill. My mom was asking me for extra money for food. Then I was buying laundry detergent, gas, extra bills. I caught her in lies about the bills. A bill my grandma already paid, my mom would ask me money for. \n\nI remember once I bought her a toothbrush and she complained it was the wrong brand. I got her orgel for her tooth and she complained it was bad because it wasn\u2019t \u201cname brand\u201d. \n\nWhen my mom was upset the last time, It was because she randomly showed up to my house and I didn\u2019t come to the door because I was dressing my son. So she went home and sent me a long text stating I should\u2019ve let her in. She doesn\u2019t respect any boundaries. \n\nThat was the final time I talked to my mother. Maybe 6 months ago? \n\nShe bagged up everything I ever gave her and randomly dropped it off outside my apartment on my front porch. Didn\u2019t even know she was coming. \n\nI\u2019ve ask one simple thing from my grandma- I want no contact with my mother and I don\u2019t want my son having any contact with her. And if she talks trash about me, tell her to stop.\n\nI still ask occasionally how she is to make sure she\u2019s alive and well. \n\nMy problem is- my mom still continues to text and call my grandma bad things about me. Then, she gets upset when my son is over there, and we won\u2019t allow her to talk to him. He is 4 and doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him. \n\nI have stayed inside for the last 7 days so I could go over to my grandmas house. She is very high risk, and we don\u2019t want to risk giving her Covid. So every time we go over there, we quarantine and test. Which is very hard to do considering I have a son who wants to go out. \n\nMy mom knows I was spending time with my grandma, and so she made plans to come stay with my grandma for 3 days. I had plans to go over there Monday, but guess not now. \n\nI feel betrayed if I\u2019m being honest. I never had an issue with my mother having a relationship with my grandma, but I\u2019m tired of the constant disrespect. My grandma and I never had a normal relationship, she was *like a mom to me*. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to go about this, but at this point, it\u2019s crossed my mind cutting everybody off to get some peace. I know if my mother was continually talking badly about my grandmother, I would\u2019ve said something. \n\nAll of this really makes my POTS horrible and my chronic health conditions. I deal with really bad panic attacks, currently getting over agoraphobia with exposure therapy. The stress is sending me through the roof. \n\nI feel like this is beyond just a mom and daughter having a fight. I\u2019m not sure if it was abuse growing up, but I know it\u2019s not normal. And it almost hurts my grandma chose to have contact with her after knowing how badly it has been. \n\nThe stress only continues because it goes \u201cthrough\u201d my grandmother. My grandma tells me what my mom says about me or the texts. \n\nJust a few minutes ago my grandma said my mom \u201cbroke everything in her apartment and cut her foot\u201d because she thinks I purposely planned on spending time with my grandma during \u201cher days\u201d when we had this planned for weeks. \n\nI just can\u2019t take anymore.\n\nHow should I handle this? It\u2019s really negatively affecting my health?\n\nTLDR; I went no contact with my mother. She continues to talk badly about me to my grandmother. My grandma tells me about it and it upsets me and gets me very anxious. My mother continues to start drama and issues. My grandmother continues a relationship with her even though she says she \u201ccan\u2019t stand her, doesn\u2019t trust her, and is fed up\u201d.

We live\ntogether at his parent's house.\n\nI freelance act and model when I have free time outside\nof college. For fun, I do stand-up comedy at a few\nvenues throughout our region\/county.\n\nThrough stand-up, I've made a lot of friends. I'm not\ntight-knit with them or anything, but we bond over it a lot\nand sometimes go out for pizza after shows.\n\nOne guy in particular (M41) hosts his own comedy show\nthat I perform at every two weeks. He gives me a lot of\nfeedback on my material and has helped me learn how to\nhost my own show. He also films short skits online for\nfun. He has a great camera setup too. He is single and\nhas no children.\n\nMy boyfriend (19M) is incredibly jealous whenever he\n(M41) communicates with me. My boyfriend hardly\nwants him around me and I've had to practically beg him\nnot to make a scene or be disrespectful to him at our\nshows. I've explained many times that I'm not interested\nin him, and that I love the man I chose. My boyfriend\nthinks he is flirting with me or wants to be intimate, but\n(M41) has this excited flirty jokey personality and acts\nthe same way with everyone. I've tried explaining this to\nmy boyfriend, but he still doesn't like it.\n\nI've booked two auditions for short films. They have to be\nself-taped at home. (M41) lives alone and has many\nspaces to film these tapes. He has acting experience and\ncould be the reader (Other person I need to interact with in the script) for the scenes.\n\nBefore even contacting (M41) to ask for his help, I told\nmy boyfriend that I was going to ask for his help, and I\ntold him that he could come watch because he doesn't\nwant me alone with this other guy. My boyfriend offered\nto be the reader for me, but I explained to him that he\nisn't a strong public speaker (I often have difficulty\nhearing him), and that he doesn't have acting experience.\nI also explained that (M41) knows how to film properly,\nand that there are clips that would need one of his tripods or something. He was still upset and tried to make any possible alternative to asking him; promising\nto perfectly memorize the lines, speaking clearly, etc. I\ntold him that these auditions are important to me, and\nthey need to be the best quality they can be. I promised\nhim that he can be there to supervise. He felt better, and\ntold me I have to let him know as soon as I find out schedules and that it has to work out so that he can be there.\n\nToday, I got a response from (M41). He is going to help\nme with the scenes. Unfortunately, I found out that the\naudition tapes are due on March 12th. (M41) is still able\nto help, but after talking to my boyfriend, there isn't a\ntime that works to film that would allow my boyfriend to\nbe there. I asked (M41) if tonight would work, so that I\ncould have my boyfriend there (I didn't mention that it\nwas because of my boyfriend). Unfortunately it didn't\nwork for (M41). I explained to my boyfriend that we will\nhave to film tomorrow. He said \"I don't care what the\ncircumstances are, I don't want you hanging out with ___ alone\". I keep trying to reassure him that everything is going to be strictly platonic, and that this is important for my acting career. He just keeps saying \"You're not going\" and that I messed up and that I'm making him worry which is affecting him at work.\n\nI personally feel like I shouldn't allow his jealousy make\nme miss opportunities in my acting career.\n\nTLDR: I have to film audition tapes and I seeked out a\nmale friend to help me with it.

So when I came back to my home country I chose the capital to live in where I didn't know anyone so I downloaded tinder.  \n\nStarted swiping left and right until after a few weeks I met my current gf. I liked that she was humble, seemed to have decent values, there was some attraction, sex was decent. We didn't have much in common though, but I decided that I want to proceed to get serious with her and build a future on the fact that she has good values and maybe I will help her to grow, so we started dating.\n\nWe were dating for around 2-3 months and I liked that she showed me around the city and also was constantly offering lots of activities, sex was also like I said decent and after around 3-4 months of relationship I offered to move in together.\n\nFast forward 4 years:\n\nI don't like so many things about her, for example:\n\n1. She doesn't have any close friends to hang out or to talk about her life and do girl things together\n2. She doesn't have any hobbies\n3. She can't cook. I mean she tries but food basically has no taste. Even after watching hundreds of episodes about cooking.\n4. She gained like 50lbs\n5. She nags me constantly about lack of attention, affection and about lack of sex\n6. She began pressuring me for us to get married and have kids. Pressure is coming from her two married sisters, from her mother and also she scrolls insta daily where all her uni friends are getting married and have babies.\n\nSo basically we are at this point where we either get serious, postpone the decision for a year at maximum or breakup now. And I'm not sure what I should do. \n\nI'm not exactly a golden boyfriend myself, things that I don't like about myself:\n\n1. I have ADHD. I can't get excited about normal things, I only have a specific range of interests and basically could spend all of my time inside home without going out.\n2. I'm a stressed out workaholic\n3. Im at least 60lbs overweight\n4. I Have zero libido, we have a dead bedroom (my girlfriend likes having sex but for me it's been a chore for the past year and maybe more, we do it max once a week). That is impacting our relationship but I can't change much about this at the moment. Since I'm constantly stressed out, I could barely get it up even if she was 10 out of 10 (and I had that experience in the past already). But she takes it very personally and started to get resentful about that.\n5. I'm not romantic or very affectionate at all, only doing boyfriend things like flowers or movies on national holidays\n6. I never plan any activities for me and my gf to do together. I never surprise her. I simply don't have the energy for that. I do the boyfriend stuff like flowers and movies on national holidays but that feel like a chore, not like something I really look forward to.\n\nSo what I think happened is those 3 years abroad messed me up and I came back to my country very lonely and with really low standards. \n\nI knew from the start that we barely had anything in common with this girl, but I've liked that she felt like a safe choice because I could trust her and she would never betray me. I hoped that she will become more like me and we'l have more interesting things to do or talk about, but lately we barely have anything in common. Basically I feel now that she doesn't have anything to offer to me, other than suffocating companionship just so I wouldn't feel alone. But I'm too young to settle for that.\n\nNowadays all I feel is that I'm shouldering all of the responsibility myself:\n\n1. 2 years ago I saved up enough to get a mortgage and I felt serious about her so I put her name on papers even though I financed the whole thing. Moving in required taking up additional debt that I'm working hard to pay off I'm stressed because of that ever since.\n2. Since I make good money, for the past 4 years 85% of the time what we eat is takeaway that I order\n3. I finance all vacations and trips abroad\n4. 2 years ago we got a dog that she wanted but I'm the one who's taking care of the dog 90% of the time.\n\nWhat doesn't help is that she broke her leg 4 weeks ago and since then we are stuck together in home working from home together. I feel like I'm loosing my mind. I was able to cope with this relationship when I had 10-11 hours to myself everyday of working\/alone time, but now I don't have that anymore.\n\nMy only alone time right now staying up late until 3-4am, binge eating, binge watching tv shows, drinking alcohol and knocking myself out with a xanax so I could sleep. I like going to sleep when she's asleep because I know she won't force me to have sex with her. During the day I rely on caffeine and cigarettes to numb my emotions so that I wouldn't be suffocated emotionally with constant emotional\/household needs during the day and I could enter workmode where I'm able to do some actual work. That's how I live now.\n\nRight now my dream is that in 2-3 weeks her leg heals completely and she goes back to working in the office, then I will regain my alone time and hopefully will be able to drop the bad habits that I'm using to cope now and hopefully I will feel better. \n\nBut lately Ive been thinking, how we are going to live together in the future if he get married and have babies, If I'm loosing my mind by just staying with her together stuck in home for few weeks? I'm bored of her. I feel like her father, not like her potential husband. I know partially it's my fault, because I got myself into this state,  partially it's my ADHD that impacts my emotions and I'm not really able to form long lasting relationships with anyone. Maybe if I learn how to relax, fix my habits, regain my alone time for recovery, maybe then I will be able to look at this situation from a better perspective when I will have more clarity. But right now, everything has added up. If you add havin a kid to this equation with all of the additional stress that comes to it I would go crazy. Seriously. I feel totally hopeless and not ready for getting married or having kids because that just means more extra work, with more extra nagging. I don't know what to do. Any opinions or advices welcome.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: I'm struggling with my relationship of 4 years with my girlfriend who I no longer feel connected to. Maybe it's because I've been very stressed and overwhelmed lately since I've been taking care of her because she broke her leg few weeks ago and now we spend all of our time working and living from home. \n\nHowever I feel that we have different values and interests, we have a dead bedroom mainly because I have zero libido due to stress and probably due to the fact that both of us gained a lot of weight in the past 4 years, I don't know. Also she constantly nags me about attention and sex while also pressuring me to get married and have kids. \n\nI have my own issues to deal with and feel like I'm shouldering all the responsibilities in the relationship when I barely can take care of myself.

The last couple years he suddenly gained this patronizing superiority, as if he\u2019s just smarter than you and better than you, even if he has a better phone than you. Growing up, he got bullied a lot in school, made fun of, and had very low self esteem and was insecure. Weird part is, he was actually a much nicer guy during his insecure years. He claims to be confident and happy with himself now, but this new personality is just mean as shit. A couple years ago, he built his first PC all on his own, it\u2019s a great PC, and pretty much like half a year after that, he gained the patronizing superiority that I had mentioned. Personality had completely changed. Its almost as if his self worth is literally tied to his damn computer. He\u2019s literally been a different person ever since. Basically, when we\u2019re talking, I will show him something that is of interest to me, such as a game or a movie. He completely ignores it, as if he didn\u2019t even hear it, but whenever he says something he likes, he expects you to be all ears and always agree with him. I literally showed him this house I built on sims that actually took months, and his response was \u201cgood job?\u201d If you don\u2019t say anything that is of direct interest to him, he completely blows it off and ignores you, and changes the subject.

If I bring up a game he likes, he will sit there and talk about it for awhile, but the moment it\u2019s something that I wanna speak about, i get absolutely nothing. Also, he is always obsessed with correcting me if I say something wrong. I can spell something wrong, get a word mixed up, and he will literally act as if I\u2019m dumb without straight up calling me dumb. He\u2019s so condescending. It\u2019s almost as if he gets off on correcting me and telling people how wrong they are. If you call him out genuinely, and nicely, about something he does wrong, he makes so many excuses and pretty much denies that he did anything wrong.

I left about seven years ago to jump around and explore different places to live. I've lived in a few different places, but wound up more or less settling in Kansas City. I say I settled here because of a good job and cost-of-living and all the normal reasons, but I think the real truth is I settled down because I fell in love. I met my husband here four years ago, and we married six months ago. I can't say for certain if I would have stayed otherwise or not, but at least at the time I met him I was convinced I was happy and would be down to stay here forever. \n\nAs for my husband, he is originally from here, but moved around a lot as well before coming back shortly before I met him, and he is happy here. He's got a good job, friends, family, and a long history here. He has also been a really great partner to me. \n\nBut, apparently out of nowhere I am starting to have doubts about staying here forever. We have started talking about buying a home at some point in the near future, so I don't know if that is what is triggering it, but it has definitely brought these feelings to the front of my mind. \n\nJust over the last month or two I have started to have a longing feeling to return to Boston. I know it is dumb and irrational, but I've just suddenly really started to miss where I am from. Now I can't manage to make myself happy about the prospects of buying a home here or staying here permanently. \n\nSo I really want to move back, but can't really even articulate a specific reason.   \n\nBut I also feel like asking to move back is really unfair to my husband. He has worked really hard to help build a life for us here in Kansas City, plus he has professional licenses that may be difficult to move states (I'm not really sure how hard).

Anyways as the title says I have been together with my gf for about 7 years now, we met on a game and became quick friends and our relationship developed just as fast, over the years we only grew closer and we started meeting up IRL a lot more frequently. While we do live in the same country she still lives quite a distance away from me, specifically I'm on the mainland and she lives on a very small island so you need a boat or plane to cross.\n\nSometime last year we met again and this time it was at my house and she stayed over for a month, it was the longest we have ever stayed together and we both seemed to really love it, as usual tears were shed when we had to part but overall it was a great time. I remember a comment from her family asking when I would take her back as as she just seemed so much healthier in many ways.\n\nFast forward a few months later and things start turning a bit sour, now for context we never argued through our entire relationship so far, we just never had any reason too and we just worked things out by talking, But we were having silly little arguments that you wouldn't normally have if you were together, for example saying goodnight was one of them, I'll be honest I would get back home from a hard day of work and just jump into bed and forget to say it. I talked to my my friend who was also in a long distance relationship for 2-3 years but is now engaged to his gf and is now moved in with each other, I talked with him about the arguments we were having and the struggles and he basically told me that those would most likely go away if you were living together, just like with him.\n\nAfter that conversation and having another silly argument with my gf I brought it up about us living together and how it would make things so much easier and we seemed so inseparable from each other that I didn't think it would be an issue. Oh lord I was wrong, that turned into another BIG argument, to put it in short, she told me no because she didn't want to leave her family and that she didn't want what happened in college to happen again (She lives with her parents, she went to college on the mainland and some stuff happened, she quit college half way through and went back to live with her family, its been about 5 years since), of cause I was really hurt by this as why would she think I would let what happened to her in college happen with me. In the end after some backwards and forwards she basically offered to break up because she 100% refuses to move out of her parents house. In the end that didn't happen and I basically told her that I am not waiting forever for her to get help and get better, how long would I have to wait, a few weeks? Months? Years? when I'm a old lady? She doesn't know and I feel like I'm wasting my life away for something that's not going to happen. she says staying with her parents is helping her but with how long it has been I doubt that very much as nothing has changed and she doesn't work anymore, just sits in her room on the computer most of the days but will sometimes go partying with her friends.\n\nForgot to add this part but she seemed somewhat okay living with me as long as it was on the island close to her family but the thing is, I don't want to live there, it was good to visit but to live there I would end up miserable. We both live in the country side but that island has nothing, I love going hiking around my area as it has so many mountains, forests, lakes and trials, hiking is just something I love to do but its not really something you can do there, there's barely any trees, you got one \"mountain\" and a load of flat land, I want to explore the outdoors and not be constrained to one small place. Island life is just not for me. But I did offer her that I would be willing to go as close to the island as possible on the mainland so she could still very easily see her family and yeah that would mean I'm willing to move so far away from my own family and friends just for her but she doesn't want to make any compromises.\n\nOver the months it has been horrendous, constant arguing, silent treatments, snapping at each other for the littlest of things and nothing is going progressing anymore. She did say she will try and get help and she did ask for it and is on a waiting list, not sure when she was added as she don't tell me anything anymore and I had to ask if she was even trying but it has been about 2 months now on this waiting list.\n\nHonestly I'm so stressed and depressed that I don't know what to do, she's constantly on my mind but I don't know if this is a healthy relationship anymore.. I need help on what I Should do, splitting up has been on my mind for a while now but I don't know if I can live without her. I want this to work out so badly but I feel like I'm grasping at straws. Should I wait longer maybe, should I change how I approach things, what should I do, I'm so miserable right now.\n\nThere is a few things missing but ill edit this post or leave a comment if more context is necessary.\n\n TL;DR: I have a long distance relationship of 7 years with my girlfriend but she doesn't want to move out of her parents house or away from the island she lives on to be with me but I don't want to live on a island. Tried compromising but she wont budge.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678445310.0},{"title":"I (23F) need help moving on after a violent meltdown","author":"Slow-Wonder-6416","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11od41a\/i_23f_need_help_moving_on_after_a_violent_meltdown\/","text":"I am 23F but still living with my parents.

Lynx moved away from the town that I live in and I couldn\u2019t handle the reality that we were in a long distance relationship (I've tried long distance before and it has only turned into mutual resentment and eventually a failed relationship and no recourse for a friendship) and decided it was best for me to end the relationship with Lynx- we had been in a partnership for 10 months at this point. Jaguar and I had been cultivating a friendship before (2 months) and after the breakup process (3 months) with Lynx and admittedly meeting Jaguar and seeing how we vibed together and wanting to see where that would go was a motivating factor to end things with Lynx.\n\nI felt like Jaguar and I really connected and I felt myself evolving emotionally and communicating in ways that I never thought possible of myself. The transparency and honesty surrounding our communication was unprecedented compared to any other relationship I had ever cultivated. We share so many interests and I felt really comfortable leaning into our companionship. I did make it clear that it would take some time for me to properly move on from my relationship with Lynx, but we had a hard time holding back our sexual drive and soon found ourselves sharing some of the most potent sexual experiences I've ever had.\n\nWe would go to the farmers market together, cook together, read together, and do most things under the sun and moon together. We still had plenty of days apart, but our line of communication was consistent and we checked in with one another at least every other day, if not everyday. As things were heating up, she did mention that she would get extremely attached as we moved forward in our sexual intimacy. I went to South America for a week and she joked that I shouldn't 'get with any Argentinian chicks' and I wasn't even considering the thought of that until she mentioned it. I felt sexually connected with her and because we were having unprotected sex, wasn't planning to have sex with anyone else.\n\nAt some point in our relationship, I was feeling really mushy gushy about her and slid in the word 'partnership' when we were chatting and she was quick to correct me that we were in a 'companionship'. This will be a topic that comes back up in a conversation I have later with Jaguar.\n\nWe always joked about 'what would our first fight be about?' because we had yet to have a proper argument or conversation that led into disagreement. Don't get me wrong, we had plenty of difficult discourse that we navigated together, but it always resulted in mutual understanding and moving forward with clarity because of the conversation. This almost brings us to our 'first fight', which at the time, I didn't even realize was a fight because I didn't feel like I was arguing during the conversation. We went to an ecstatic dance class (where we danced together and separate and had a slow dance together at the end). I felt super connected with her and was happy that we could experience a social event together without puppy dogging each other.\n\nAfter the class, she approached me and told me how she was irritated about my friendship with another girl, let's call Tiger (F29), that I've known for almost 2 years. Tiger and I have a proper platonic friendship and really enjoy spending time together. We like to practice art, go on neighborhood walks, and watch films and undoubtedly get along quite well as we both have at times, a crass sense of humor, and don't judge each other for our sometimes off-color jokes. Sometimes Tiger sleeps over in my bed when it gets late watching movies or hanging out so she doesn't have to drive home and she conveniently has work around the corner from my house the next day. I've had this relationship with Tiger throughout my partnership with Lynx and it has never been an issue.\n\nI had mentioned the context of my relationship with Tiger at one point to Jaguar, and she had mentioned that she found it weird, but didn't really go any deeper than that. This takes us back to the more present conversation with Jaguar, where she had mentioned she was irritated about my relationship with Tiger and that it makes her uncomfortable. I had sensed there were some not-so-mutual-happy feelings between the two, but did not fully grasp it until Jaguar and I talked more about it. Jaguar told me that she felt hurt that I would have another woman in my bed, even if it wasn't sexual and I was a bit surprised and unsurprised at the same time. Because it was never an issue in my relationship with Lynx, I guess it became normalized in my head, but taking a step back from that conditioning, I realized that it could very easily be seen as a hurtful thing. I thanked Jaguar for expressing her feelings to me and told her how I saw it and how we might have different perspectives on the subject, but assured her that I was sorry that I hurt her and that I was willing to compromise and have that not be a part of my friendship with Tiger.\n\nMaybe not the most opportune time to bring it up, but I mentioned how she corrected me recently that we were in a 'companionship' and not a 'partnership' and how she felt about those labels and what they meant. I think I was poking the bear looking back on it, but I couldn't help myself when it seemed like I wasn't doing anything wrong as we were in more of a companionship right now. She said that she saw the trajectory of our relationship to be headed towards a partnership, but we just didn't have that conversation yet and that it would happen in due time. I reminded her that it was probably a good idea to move slow, but that I also agreed that I'd like to have our relationship move in that trajectory. We ended with a kiss, she told me how much she cared about me, and we went our separate ways for the night. She later texted me that night \"Appreciate you and our relationship, Thinking of you\"\n\nAnd that was the last I heard from her, for one week now...\n\nI texted her a few times on Saturday, inviting her to a few functions, asking how she was etc.-- Nothing. I gave her a bit more space on Sunday after trying to call her,..nothing. I told her I was feeling anxious and uneasy on Monday morning and that I hope she was ok and if she could please reach back out in some capacity,... nothing. I went to back to back yoga classes on Monday evening where I saw her for a brief moment, but decided not to approach and have her approach me if she were comfortable.. She left as I went into the studio and did not attend class, effectively avoiding any sort of interaction. I bought her this cool surf art book, wrote her a letter and drew a picture for her, delivering it on Wednesday,..nothing so far.\n\nI realize she has a busy work schedule and maybe just needs time on her own to process what's going on in the relationship, but in turn she has left me out high and dry after we had such an open communication style before. I feel like she just dropped me like a sack of potatoes. I didn't even need a solid reason why she wanted to avoid me or end things, or whatever else ---but just avoiding the whole situation by ghosting me was what really hurt- all while she's been aware of my anxious attachment style. Especially after the night we had our talk and she told me how much she cared for me. None of it adds up in my head, which has lead to feelings of abandonment and betrayal. Ultimately I've tried to refocus it as an opportunity to cultivate a deeper relationship with myself by working through these visceral feelings through acts of self-care. I especially don't harbor any negative feelings surrounding what she did, or didn't do in this case. I just hope we can move on from this at some point and find some understanding and either move on and be friends or use it as an opportunity to reshape our relationship in some other way. I'm still figuring out how I feel day by day, but it definitely has catalyzed a rocky week for me. I'm super grateful to have such a supportive network of friends and family so I've been able to process it a lot quicker than I would have otherwise. But still it has kept me wandering and wondering in my head to a degree that I find a bit unproductive. Pushing through and doing productive things regardless of how I'm feeling has been the most mature way I can handle it, but it's definitely been mixed in with some escapism and ruminating about the course of our relationship.\n\n**Is there any recourse for our relationship or friendship? What could she possibly be feeling right now? Will she reach back out to me? Why is she ignoring me? What do I do to move forward? Am I even asking the right questions?**\n\nThank you so much for reading-- I hope this experience provides some insight and spurs some productive conversations about radio silence\/ghosting in situations where everything seems to be going well. If you have any questions for me or want clarification on anything, feel free to reach out in the comments or slide into my DMs. I am a hopeless romantic and have been in a number of relationships and have learned something extremely valuable about the world, myself, and them in each one and am super thankful to have been in a situation where I could love and be loved.

My gut said otherwise. And I asked him a million times throughout the time we are together. And he gave me the same story every time. That they slept once and have no communication at all. He even told me that he would prefer not meeting her if I had an issue with it rather than creating problems in our relationship. Which I stupidly believed.\n\nThe true story is, they slept together more than once. Multiple times until he left the country for work. And they still kept contact through dms. And he of course met her from close when he visited his country during holidays.\n\nThis triggered major trust issues. I believe that nothing happened between them since she's now in a relationship.\n\nWould you be okay if your partner was friends with a girl he slept with?

My brother and I have never been especially close really. He's a super nice guy and I do love him, but partially due to the age difference and partially because we are very different personalities I think, we never really felt like siblings. More like kind of good cousins or something. He left home and joined the military when I was still pretty young, and I didn't have a whole lot of contact with him after that, other than exchanging Christmas\/Birthday gifts and whatnot. I know he got out of the Army after a few years, went to college, and settled down with wife a long ways away from where the rest of the family lives.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do love him and he's been very nice to me when we do spend time together.\n\nI'm having a bit of an identity crisis right at the moment. I'm in my final year of college and kind of struggling to figure out what comes next. My dad can be kind of overbearing and I was worried about spending Spring Break with my parents because I knew they would harp on me about career stuff. I privately mentioned it to my mom and she suggested spending Spring Break with my brother. He has a house and kids and my mom said she was sure he would love to have me. She suggested it my be a good way to get some space from my dad and see a new part of the country, and maybe figure some stuff out for myself while also getting closer to my older brother.\n\nIt seemed like a good plan, big bro contacted me after mom asked him and told me he and his wife would love to have me, and I arrived at their home the day before yesterday.\n\n**Problem**\n\nSo all of that to say, I'm here staying with my brother and his wife and kids now at his house. My brother is being super nice and I really appreciate him, the problem I am having is with his wife.\n\nShe's just kind of.....strange. Not mean or unfriendly, just really odd. I kinda knew she was a little off-beat from their wedding photos; they had some kind of Pagan marriage ceremony out in the woods where she wore a canvas dress and leaves in her hair. I'm not trying to knock it, just demonstrating that she's a bit offbeat.\n\nBut now I'm here and spending time with her and I'm finding it hard to warm up to her because she just kind of weirds me out a little. She has this sort of vacant expression in her eyes, constantly. It's been there since they picked me up at the airport. It always looks like she is staring at something way out in the distance, even when she is talking to you. She talks to me, but it's like she is just kind of staring over my shoulder the entire time. I'm not sure how else to describe it except she never seems to actually focus on anything in particular.\n\nShe also just does not seem entirely present. Even when she is talking to me it's like her mind is somewhere way the hell away from the living room we're sitting in. We'll be trying to have a conversation and she just kind of trails off mid-sentence and seems to forget what she was talking about. She also only really ever talks in a whisper. It's hard to hear her because she talks very quietly, even to my brother and their kids. Oh, and also her plants. Their home is full of plants and I hear her constantly whispering to them as she goes around watering them.\n\nThe one time so far I have really managed to get a lengthy amount of words out of her was from asking about her tattoos. My brother and her both have large amounts of their bodies tattooed, and I have a couple small ones, so it seemed like a good way to try and break the ice with her. I asked her about her tattoos, as she has a *ton*, and she sat down with me and spent probably over an hour going over every. single. one. Where she got it, what it meant, the story of why she wanted it. She has some cool ink but I was not ready for the info dump and felt a little silly showing off my little line-tattoo on my ankle.\n\nAnd I'm finding a lot of her habits to be just....odd. She actually scared the crap out of me last night. I woke up at probably around 2 or 3 in the morning and had to go to the bathroom, so I walked out of the bedroom into the hall and suddenly heard her whisper-voice. After a minute I finally saw her sitting on a love seat next to a window, just staring out at the dark.\n\nHave you ever seen a horror movie where there is some person staring away from the protagonist, and then suddenly their head just whips around to stare at them really quick? I swear it was just like that; one second she is staring out the window (whispering?), and the next her head just whipped around and her distant-eyes are looking at me. I was actually kind of genuinely scared that I stumbled onto something, but she just quietly asked if I needed anything and wished me a good night. Then went back to her window-staring. I mentioned it to my brother this morning and he just said she does that some nights.\n\nOther habits she has are to just wander the house. I was paying attention today while my brother was at work and it seems like she just wanders from one room to the other. Never really sitting down or doing anything in particular. She spent a bit of time picking up the house, but otherwise she just wandered around, whispered to her plants, and takes care of the kids. And then at one point she took the kids out in the backyard to a garden they have and just sat with them for probably 30 minutes. She told me that she likes to do that with them so the kids will feel \"closer to the Earth\" and invited me to join them. I went out with them to try and be friendly and we just....sat.....in the garden, mostly in silence for about 30 minutes. She brushed some of her plants out there, but otherwise just sat on the bare ground with the kids.\n\nSo....and I'm trying to be nice here....this lady just weirds me out. She's been nice and accommodating to me yes, but she is really odd and I am really having a hard time trying to warm up to her. She clearly loves my brother and their kids; at some point in the afternoon yesterday and today she suddenly came into the living room with a big grin to let me know that my brother was pulling home, and the only real emotion I have seen from her is with him or them.\n\nSo I would like to be friends with this lady, in the interest of good sibling relations. But I am really having a hard time figuring out how to be friends with her. Half the time I can't even tell if she is talking to me or not.\n\nHow do you make friends with someone like this? What on earth can I do to try and be close to someone who doesn't even seem all the way connected to reality?\n\n**TL;DR:** Spending time with my brother and his wife.

It can be up to a two day drive home too so there will be times she may not make it home. There is no consistent location to me relocating to a different area is not an option. There is no set schedule on places so planning flying out is also off the table for the most part. \n\nAfter being asked so many times over and over by my GF I finally cracked and I agreed.

The only thing that\u2019s been bothering me is the house management. A few months ago, my bf got laid off and hasn\u2019t been working since. He will be working in a few weeks but these past months have been making me feel some kind of way. I clean every week as much as I can with all the tiredness I have except for last week. I\u2019ve realized I\u2019ve been cooking a little more than him. And when I\u2019m working the 4 days out of the week, the house is messy. Especially the kitchen. I know I\u2019ve been messy after I cook but I still clean my messes after a day or so. All my bf does is load dishes in the dishwasher and take out trash. He cooks every now and then and last week he cooked for those 4 days I\u2019ve been working. But that\u2019s it. The other day we were talking about random things until I brought up how sometimes I wished I was a house girlfriend (though I really don\u2019t and it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been exhausted) he immediately says he likes independent women and I\u2019m not gonna lie, I felt like crap and didn\u2019t really say much until the next day after I came home from work. I asked him what he meant by \u201cI prefer independent women\u201d and he said the generic thing like he likes women who have their own money etc. I told him I felt offended because I thought he said that because of what I said about being a house girlfriend.

Honestly I didn\u2019t believe him so I continued on saying I don\u2019t feel secure with him if I were to lose job and would be afraid to leave him.

Our relationship is great and healthy. When we met, he was close friend\u2019s with a woman(29f, we will call her Jessica) who is the mother of his best friend at the time\u2019s(30m, we\u2019ll call him James) child. The best friend(Who he is no longer in contact with due to just general pos behavior) lived across the country from us as he moved away from his son and also Jessica(they were broken up for a while at that point.) \n\nBy the time James had moved away, my boyfriend had become kind of an uncle figure to his son. My boyfriend loves children and he is incredibly close to the little boy(we\u2019ll call him Gus), so after James moved away, he continued to make an effort to spend time with Gus and eventually became friends with Jessica. They hung out a lot, a lot of it due to my boyfriend trying to ensure that this kid that he cares about has consistent figures in his life. Jessica has a lot of issues, and one of the main ones is the revolving door of people(particularly men) that come in and out of her life, and as a consequence, her son\u2019s life.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I met, he was very open about his relationship to this child and his mother and I was okay with it. I also love children and it did not take very long for me to love Gus too. I also got along with his mother in the beginning, we have some things in common and she can be fun at times. \n\nBut as time has gone on, it has become more and more clear that Jessica is an energy vampire. This woman has an absolute crisis and needs to be rescued like once every 6 months. And she just Can\u2019t. Be. Single. She is fairly good at being a parent most of the time, but the part that she just can\u2019t manage is consistency in her relationships. Which wouldn\u2019t be as much of an issue if it didnt affect her son, but it does because she just brings these men around before truly taking the time to screen them as decent partners. Not in a way where I am worried about Gus\u2019s safety, but in a way of she starts dating someone and then all the sudden they\u2019re moving in together or they\u2019re always around and there\u2019s no adjustment period for Gus. \n\nThe amount of times we have helped her move under duress because all the sudden she and the person she\u2019s dating break up suddenly(even though we tell her that things are not looking great and she should consider looking into breaking it off) is getting ridiculous. Honestly, we don\u2019t do it for her, we do it because we don\u2019t want Gus to suffer from her behavior. We\u2019ve picked her up, we\u2019ve taken Gus whenever we can, watched her cat, helped her with her business, we\u2019ve done a lot. We are always the one\u2019s who are there to help because we can\u2018t bring ourselves to not answer the call.\n\nAnd she doesn\u2019t even seem to care what\u2019s going on in our lives. It is pretty clear overall that she doesnt actually value us as friends.\n\nIt is so frustrating to watch her keep doing the same thing over and over again. She is immature. And after the last time(another time she had to move out of her boyfriends house who we told her she should not be with, and most DEFINITELY not move in with), my boyfriend and I knew that we needed to set a boundary with her because the stress of her puts a lot of strain on both of our mental health. \n\nSo we talked about what we needed to say and we planned to have dinner at her house and after her son went to bed, we told her we needed to have a serious conversation. We told her that we care about her and her son, but we can\u2019t watch them keep going through this same song and dance. Basically made it clear that if this happens again, we will always be a safe place for Gus to land, he will always have a safe place to stay with us and that if she needs more help with him to be able to vet people by going out with them away from her son, we can do that, but we can\u2019t keep helping her the way we have because it doesn\u2019t seem to actually be helping. Essentially outlining that we are not coming to her rescue next time. At this point, it feels like enabling. We wrote a letter to leave with her about things that we are not saying to make sure she doesnt think we think she\u2019s a bad person, because we don\u2019t. Immature, yes, but not a bad person. \n\nObviously she didnt take it well, pretty much just shut down and wouldnt respond. So we said our piece, left the letter and went home.\n\nPersonally, I felt like we really tried to approach the situation in a kind and respectful way, but I could be wrong. But ever since then, she\u2019s definitely been mad at us and accused my boyfriend of \u201dbeing combative\u201d towards her lately. Which to me just feels like she\u2019s upset that we\u2019re not just doing whatever she wants us to do or agreeing with everything she says. \n\nI\u2019m so at a loss at this point. My boyfriend and I are on the same page of just being so done with her behavior. But we love this kid as if he were our own and we just want him to have a safe and healthy childhood, and it\u2019s hard when she\u2019s doing things in direct opposition of that. What can we even do? Are we making it worse? She is a big stressor in our lives and if it were just her, I would not still be friends with her. But she and Gus are a package deal. How can we keep reasonable boundaries while still having access to the child care about? I fear that she will grow frustrated with us not doing\/saying what she wants and then we will not be a part of his life as much as we would like to be.\n\nAny advice or constructive criticism is appreciated. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- My boyfriend and I(29m and 26f) love a child(8m) whose mother(29f) is a difficult person to be around and it\u2019s causing us a lot of stress.

He is nothing but uplifting and supportive to me and he's the love of my life. Any time I get to spend hearing his voice or even just texting him I feel the happiest I can be. Heck, I can't even remember the last time, or any times at all, that we've ever argued. Even though we're long distance, we've been together for three years, friends for... around six or seven years before that, and I only want to go forward.  \n\n\nAs to our actual conflict, I'm an insecure emotional wreck. This is the first (consensual\/genuine) relationship I've been in, and even if it doesn't end up lasting forever I still want it to be fruitful. There's a lot of things I struggle with, and I frequently just end up bottling it up and trying to stomach it, but it keeps leading to nights where I just end up breaking down.   \n\n\nI know I should just share it with him, after all we're a couple, we're supposed to share each others burdens and he's always able to communicate when something bothers him, but I just can't bring myself to. Every time I try, I get into a mental state where I just convince myself that I'm shoveling my problems onto him, that he doesn't deserve to have to put up with my baggage and that I'm just an unnecessary burden. I'm sure it sounds stupid to think like that, but with how he's always so frequently drained from the job he's had from the past year, I don't want to add onto his exhaustion or muddy his better\/free days with my emotional problems.  \n\n\nOn top of that, I always have this creeping feeling that I'm just holding him down from pursuing a more fulfilling relationship. Every time he tells me that I'm everything he could ever ask for, I can never take it at face value. There's nothing about him that would lead him to think cruelly of me, and even though I'm certain that he does genuinely mean it, I still end up convinced it's all a lie just to make me feel better. My brain keeps telling me that because I'm not a 'real woman', I'll never satisfy him and I'll always have parts of me that make me repulsive and unfulfilling (this is NOT something I genuinely or would ever believe\/say of other trans folk, this is entirely my own crippling lack of self esteem from things I've been told of myself in the past).   \n\n\nI feel like I'm just not hearing the right specific thing I need to cement his words for me. At the same time, I also wonder if maybe he's just too worried about saying something that'll tick off something I'm sensitive or uncomfortable about. In particular, I worry that I might have instilled that myself by accident.   \n\n\nFor context, he knows I'm somewhere on the asexual spectrum and understands I have my own troubles standing up for myself\u2014and there have been times in the past where I had showed that I was intimidated or sounded as if I felt pressured into indulging him sexually\u2014but I really do trust him a lot and feel comfortable with him, I have not once allowed him to make me do anything that I didn't decide I also wanted to do.   \n\n\nAdditionally, I don't know if I'm supposed to divulge into why I'm so sensitive and averse to sex? I wonder if telling him what it is specifically that triggers my discomforts and bad memories would help him understand me better so that we could work together. Considering that he's someone with a higher libido, I don't want him to be left unsatisfied just because of my own struggles and traumas. Hell, even worse, I'd hate it if we ever did end up splitting up and he'd be left with his own kind of intimidation toward approaching intimacy.   \n\n\nI worry that this is all long winded, but I just sincerely want to know. I don't know how to communicate any of this to my boyfriend.   \n\n\nWhat I'm specifically asking for is, how do I approach telling him that despite his praise and affection I still ultimately end up feeling like I'm not worth it for him and I want to hear his most wholehearted and earnest words?   \n\n\nAm I even supposed to share the trauma that's left me scarred since it's already so distant in the past and out of place?   \n\n\nHow do I begin a conversation like this without it coming out of left field or sounding overwhelming?  \n\n\nShould I even bite the bullet and burden him with all this in the first place?  \n\n\nI don't know, but it all just really bothers me and when it festers in my head for too long I end up feeling as alone and pained as I would without a partner. He wouldn't want that for me, and I want to be better for him.  \n\n\nTL;DR: I'm constantly worried about sharing my problems with my boyfriend because I don't want to further contribute to any of his stress because of his job, but I also think I understand that regardless a relationship works best when both sides are able to communicate with each other and that we'll be better off if that is the case. How do I approach sensitive topics, or should I just avoid it altogether if he's stressed?","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678490002.0},{"title":"I am meeting my partner for the last time tomorrow before he moves to a different continent","author":"glauconight","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11nxh9f\/i_am_meeting_my_partner_for_the_last_time\/","text":"\nMy boyfriend (25M) and I(23F) have been together for almost five years and have known each other for six. We met when we were 18 and 19 respectively, and have spent a lot of time together in the first three years of our relationship. I believe this was the time when both of us started evolving into the people that we are today and we have affected each other to a great extent. We were classmates in college, but our hometowns are around 700 km apart. We went into a LDR once the pandemic struck, and since I moved to a different city for my Master's program across the country we had to continue being in a LDR. Both of us work in the same field, he works in academia and I have a job in a similar domain. \nHe got selected in a PhD program in another country and I am so so proud of him. He didn't have the best time since the pandemic and now all his hard work is finally paying off. Makes me cry just by thinking about how far he has come. \nI work in a different city than where he lives in (which is my hometown). Almost 2000 km away. I am meeting him tomorrow, and I go back to my job the day after. He leaves for his studies in April. Even though I am looking at flights and leave applications, in all probability I am meeting him the last time tomorrow. Last in a long long time (air fare is crazyyyy expensive where we're from). It sounds very codependent of me but the thought of him being so far away physically, with a time zone difference is making me spiral. The only reason I am writing this post is to stop myself from having a panic attack (apologies if I am using the term incorrectly, I am not 'panicking' per se, I will lose control of my emotions and will need to go through the \"5 things to see..\" drill to recover).\nThis is not coming out of the blue. We both know we want to pursue higher studies. We both know we have at least 5+ years of long distance ahead of us. We always talked about this in the future tense. But now it's here. And I am having such a hard time accepting it. He already has a lot on his plate so I don't want to talk about this with him. I want to have one last nice day with him, but I am afraid I will ruin it. I just hope I have the strength to wake up the next day and deal with life like I was doing before.\n\nTl;dr: I am moving from a long distance relationship to an even longer distance relationship with a time zone difference and I don't know how to handle it.\n\nEdit: We're not breaking up.

The only person I've ever really connected with long-term was \"Anna\" \\[19 f\\]. We've been close friends for about three years, and although I know we're growing together as adults, sometimes I feel like she doesn't really respect me. \n\nFor context, she's white, upperclass, and conservative and I'm Black, lower-middle class, and left-leaning. She identifies as an independent, but I say she leans conservative because she only supports republicans and conservative policy (she was a big Trump supporter back then, but doesn't really speak on him as much anymore lol). Obviously I'm not one to care much about politics. If it was a problem, I would've avoided her those years ago. But earlier in out relationship, she'd say things that just didn't sit right with me. \n\nFor example: when she was applying to college, she was rejected from her first choice uni while a Black student (this student was also my friend) was accepted. Anna complained to me that this student only got in because she was Black, that she didn't deserve the school, that she had awful grades, etc, etc. I just sort of listened awkwardly because I wasn't sure what to say. Then, Anna said that I should just apply to any top school because they'd accept me. This really struck a chord with me. I've been in academic programs all my life, programs which were the only reason I was attending the same private high school as her. It just felt like a slap in the face for all the sacrifices I made and continue to make for my education. I go to a top school now, but sometimes I wonder if she thinks my race is the only reason I'm here. \n\nExample 2: There was a time we were just casually talking about dating, preferences, etc. She told me that she would never date a Black man, and that she'd only finds white and asian men attractive. I completely understand that everyone has their preferences, but the way she said this kind of got to me. Maybe it's just me, but I get a bit uncomfortable when people describe their \"type\" using only racial markers. I.e., \"I only like asian women,\" \"I don't like people with big lips,\" \"I don't like big noses\", \"I only date Black men.\" It's just a bit strange to me and her telling me that made me feel weird. Side note: She was dating an asian guy but after they broke up, she confuses her ex with every other asian guy at her school. \n\nI know this makes her sound pretty bad, and I agree that she can be a bit racially insensitive. However, I feel she is a good person, and she's the only one outside of my family I feel I can be myself around. Sometimes I feel like most of the blame is on me because I don't say anything, so much so that she feels comfortable saying these things to me despite my very obvious racial identity. It's just that I've struggled with anxiety for the last 7 or so years (high school was rlly horrible), so I walk on eggshells around her so that she doensn't stop being my friend. Another note: she has been known to cut people off for doing similar things. We do have a VERY good relationship - just when these issues aren't brought up lol.\n\n**I guess my question is: how should I approach this? I feel like I'm looking for problems when she doesn't say stuff like that around me as much anymore. Should I just leave it alone and hope that part of her changes?** \n\nTLDR: My only friend can be racially insensitive which makes me, a Black woman, uncomfortable sometimes. I'm not sure if I should just carry on as is and hope it subsides, or if I should muster the courage to talk about it at the risk of losing her as a friend. \n\nThis was *really* long - Sorry!","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678486731.0},{"title":"should i (26F) let my short term fling (32M) partner\/possible gf know?","author":"Awkward-Put-5742","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11o1fj4\/should_i_26f_let_my_short_term_fling_32m\/","text":"TL;DR should i let my short term tinder flings partner know the pos he is? or atleast what he said about her?\n\nlong story short, we met in our home country in brazil.  i\u2019m from florida and he\u2019s from ny. we got in a huge fight because he laced a cig with weed and in the morning grabbing my stuff he grabbed me and left a bruise so i threw his phone out the window.\n\nwe probably only spent 4 days and sleepovers together. he was going back to new york to figure things out with his life and i realized he had a girlfriend this whole time.\n\nhe spoke so bad about her, calling her ugly and how she was mean and he broke it off. and how he\u2019s slept with people because sex should be celebrated with everyone. he compared me to her saying i\u2019m perfect and his type yada yada (this girl loooks different than i do but is gorgeous) the typical stereotypical guy. i go on her instagram as i find it and see he\u2019s taken her to the same spots he begged to take me before the disaster happened. i see they\u2019re back tg now in NYC\n\nwe also had consensual sex during my period and told me not to worry because i couldn\u2019t get pregnant. \n\ni want to message her kindly and not long, just telling her to be careful and how he spoke poorly of her yada yada. am i wrong for this? it was a short term tinder fling but i think she deserves to know\n\ncan someone help me with advise please! what would you do ?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678483772.0},{"title":"How do I (22F) deal with rude female coworkers (23F)?

Also, this exact situation happened in the past and when I kindly told him the exact same thing he just ignored me, didnt even reply the message. I then told him that I cant believe that he thought I was crossing a line knowing how comprehensive I had been towards him and his behaviour, and then I enumerated some instances in which he hurted me in the past (ghosting me, ditching me plenty of times when meeting up to see the movies, not saying anything to me in Christmas, New Year's Eve or San Valentine's....) and I never said anything.

Then we met again in a different country where she went to visit family.\n\nShe chose to sleep at my place every day, for three weeks, we would have breakfast together and go on dates in the evening. During the day she would go see her family. We were as close to each other as we are right now. Scrolled up our chats. They were the same as now. Thats a bit scary. Same words, same dynamic, me asking her where is, she sending me updates. telling me how much I mean to her etc. We just had this instant connection to each other from the very beginning.\n\nThe second week she was already telling me that she is falling in love with me and that this is extremely special to her etc. this is when this happened. (third week she dropped the 'I love you')\n\nShe recently told me, she went to see a 'friend' for a few minutes just to check up with him and that he confessed his love for her (she is super pretty, these type of things happen often). She said she didn't tell me about it back then but I was like it's fine. It was just a friend as I see and super unnecessary.\n\nThen after we talked about it further, she told me that she went to his place to meet him and that he kissed her. She insisted that this guy kissed her and that she didn\u2019t do anything but it didn't make no sense to me as when a guy kisses a girl she can always block it which she didn\u2019t.\n\nShe confessed to me that they kissed but then she felt uncomfortable and left she said.\n\nThen she said she just kissed him because she felt bad for him because he told her that his life went to shit since they broke up at 13 as she further confessed that this guy was her first boyfriend when she was like 13 but they had never had slept together or anything and she just wanted to go see him as they happened to be in the same city out of coincidence and she really wanted to hear what he is up to. (keep in mind it is not her home town.\n\nWe were as close as we are right now to each other, talked the same way, said the same things. at the second week of being with me, she one day left to meet a couple she said.\n\nThat night, she was sleeping at my place, I even brought her to the city. She said she was gonna meet a couple from school and lied to me about everything. After their meeting she came back home to me and acted like she met this couple. A week after this she confessed her love to me.\n\nI don't know what to think. I would have never been able to pull this off. Now she says she thought I was a player and she was thinking that I was playing her.. Which might have seemed that way maybe but I was always very honest to her, gave her all my attention and most importantly time.\n\nShe had told me from the beginning that she is monogamous, would never see multiple people at the same time and so did I. Also since she was acting like my girlfriend and telling me all those nice things about her feelings and was truly acting like her eyes only saw me, I just felt like I owed her this. I felt like I'd be an absolutely shit person if I did so. Come on.. She was sleeping at my place every night, I was telling her all these sweet things too, taking her on daily dates, she was acting like head over heels in love with me (so quickly). I could have never seen anyone else during this time.\n\nShe told me she just lied about this in the first place because she couldn't tell me she was meeting a male friend who was her first boyfriend but actually didn't mean anything to her.\n\nI talked to her aunt about it, who knows everything about her life. She told me that she feels nothing for this guy and that she really never met this guy ever again after that. She also told me that she is very obsessed with me that she would never do anything like this ever in the relationship and I can truly see that she loves me so does her aunt.\n\nShe also told me that she was always very monogamous in every relationship she had and would never ever do something. As she is and was talking about me all time time with her since she met me. She is telling her whole family that she wants to marry me one day. That she wants to have my kids. Also introduced me to her mother. Who she never introduced to anyone before me.\n\nThe confession actually came after she started to tell her whole family about marrying me and setting dates to introduce me to them. She is very determined now to show me that i can trust her. She confessed me all about two weeks ago. For an entire week she was crying and having panic attacks all the time, as she was really regretting what she had done and was afraid that I was gonna leave her what I actually was in the beginning then I decided to give her a second chance. Now she is just sad and afraid that I will never be able to trust her but she keeps saying that we belong together and how much I mean for her.\n\nAlso happens to be that I have a common friend with this guy, he actually really is very bad with women and a total weirdo what would justify the things she said about him. I could also just ask for the truth.\n\nWhat would you do in my case? I am crazy in love with her. I still truly believe she is a nice person.\n\nEDIT:\n\nLater on she told me, they kissed because it was a person of her past and the past got a hold of her or something like this. She got back to her past for a moment. She also told me about stories in her past how she blocked kisses. She definitely didn't even try to block this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Me and my gf were as close as were are now from very early on. She used to sleep at my place spend whole day with me.

She called it a night fairly early and I messaged my boyfriend (m23) to meet him as I knew he was in town.  He'd told me what nightclub he was in not long before,  so without hearing from him I set off walking to where he was to find him. I waited in the queue for 10 minutes and messaged him twice, phoned him once, but he didn't answer any. When I finally got in the first thing I saw was him hand in hand with another girl twirling her around on the dance floor.  To me, this looked out of order as she wasn't someone he knew at all, not a friend or anything, just a random girl. They did this for about a minute then I walked up to them and she pretty much ran off and it was really awkward and he looked like a deer in headlights.  He came up to me saying how happy he was to see me,  but I was really annoyed and kept asking who she was and why he was dancing with her like that. He was getting annoyed and told me to shut the f*ck up, I then started crying and said I wanted to go home and he said he'd put me in a taxi. This is so out of character for him, but when he's had a drink he turns into someone else. He's usually very kind and thoughtful. \n\nHe walked me to a taxi and I was crying and saying I didn't want to continue the relationship, I've never seen him dance with any other girl mate like that. The only person he dances with like that is me, it wasn't sexual, but they looked like a couple. \n\n*Important note, my brother saw him on a night out a few months before this on two separate occasions on his own, talking to girls in a \"more than friendly\" manner, according to him and his friend,  but at the time he explained it away and I didn't think too much of it other than it being a bit weird that he was seen twice, alone with no guy mates there with girls he doesn't know at the bars. \n\nAnyway, the following day after seeing him with this girl I find out from my brother's long-term now ex-girlfriend that my boyfriend was dancing and talking with her for two hours and buying her drinks, drink buying was a boundary we had previously set, with him saying he considered that creating. Plus,  is gone home crying because of him dancing with another girl earlier, and said that was a boundary then he disrespected the boundary again in the same night. He said because he knows her it was different,  but he barely knows her, he's only met her a couple of times over a year ago at my family events when she was there with my brother. \n\nAt first, she said it was just friendly, but now a month later she's said that he kissed her, I don't know what to believe. I'm devastated. \n\nHe says he didn't and that he leaned in close to talk to her and their faces touched, and that he was talking all about me. But she's saying it was a kiss\/peck and that he was dancing very closely to her all night. She's sent me a video which is horrible of them dancing very closely and at one point their facea are that close they look like they are kissing. She says that they weren't kissing at that point though and the angle makes it look slightly worse than it was but still. She also said he said she looked hot and apologised after kissing her saying sorry for moving on so quickly??? \n\nHe's denying all that. She's standing by it. Me and her never got on well either, which makes it all even worse. She said she's sent this video round to her friends and theyre both smiling in it and very close and look like a couple. \n\nIs dancing like that, faces together really closely cheating? \n\nHe said the reason he's done all this is because he has a coke problem and he was so off it he didn't think about what he was doing.

Was always into her but wasn't sure if she liked me back. Slowly we got close and soon enough I would be talking to her all the time, texting each other all night until one of us just fell asleep. She finally told that she liked me back too and wouldn't mind giving us a shot. I finally got the courage to ask her out and she said she was busy for the next few weeks and that we should go out after that. Anyways, I understood and nothing changed much between us. We would still talk a lot and it felt that we were just getting closer than ever. But suddenly she changed. She stopped responding to me like before. Would take hours to reply (nothing to do with her being busy as she would be online), and when she would reply it didn't feel like before. Like something really felt off. She just became cold and a bit distant. I tried asking her about it, if she was doing well and that if there was something bothering her, but she said it was all fine. She stopped sharing details about how her day went, and well the flirting stopped too. And when I tried to flirt, she would just talk about something else instead of flirting back like before. \n\nWell, I knew I got the hint. Maybe she just doesn't want to go out with me. It was sad. Felt really really bad for days. It was like all those things she used to say just didn't even mean anything. The \"you're my favourite person\", \"I miss you\" , \"I wish I could just be with you and only you 24\/7\" were nothing. It hurt because everything I used to say to her, I meant them. And after all those things and leading me on, she was probably never into me and just killing her time on me. \n\nI tried moving on but I just can't. I miss her. And I love her. And it really hurts when she talks about other guys. And I don't know what to do about it. I still talk to her, only because I still want her to be a part of my life even if it's just as friends . But everyday it's becoming more and more difficult. I really love her, I want her to be happy, but I can't pretend to be interested about the guys she likes. And sometimes it feels like she just talks about those things to hurt me. Because I have told her, even recently, that I still like her no matter what she feels about me.\n\nAnd it's affecting my daily life. Haven't talked to her in 6 days, after she told me about a guy she's talking too, and these have been 6 very bad days for me. I kinda want to text her, but at the same time I don't want to.

We used to be groupmates at university for a few months before he dropped out and both had a crush at each other. He reached out to me five years later when he broke up with his ex and I was trying to get out of a relationship that was not working. We were together for almost five years, moving together in just three months after we started dating. We had financial problems starting our carreers living paycheck to paycheck but for the first two years it was amazing. Then I found out I had a growing interest to one of my colleagues and to my shame commited emotional cheating(talking a lot via text, taking a walk after work to a bus stop together). Me and my bf had fights and I chose to work on myself and stay commited to him, getting therapy, antidepressants and consulting a gyno because of my lack of arousal but it was hard to deal with self-hatred resulting in nicotine addiction, thoughts of ending myself and slight SH. We got a pup from a shelter which filled me with hope and gave me strenght to get better. By this time we were forced to work from home because of the pandemic. \n\nIn 2021 he finally got a well paid job and I rescued a puppy from the street nearby which inspired me to work harder on my skills and get promoted but I came to a dead end being burntout from work and constant dog training(she was a bit feral and I decided to postpone her operation so she got in heat for the first time and was acting agressive). I persisted, spending my free time on building a loft bed with crates for each pup, organising our workspaces, etc.\n\nThen, certain political events came that made me think of fleeing the country, as I was disgusted and afraid with it. I suggested a plan where we get married(as to not get separated somewhere), revaccinate our pets, get our docs in order, pack up and leave. We went out to the nearest malls to buy cheap rings when he said he still wants to propose to me and that it's important to him to keep it romantic. Then, he proceeded to fail with the docs(I got mine in a month). He even lost the main one that we'd need to get a marriage certificate and refused to get it restored for some time. I was trying to play it cool and wait till he gets everything done but he never did. When I asked him about the docs, he only replied with \"fails happen, you know\".\n\nI was blaming myself for the situation, so I got back to therapy, flew to another city to see a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with ADHD and ASD(specialists in my city only diagnosed me with neurasthenia). I was learning to work with those conditions using CBT, DBT and schema therapy, learning techniques of NVC to communicate with him my want to change the fact that we're stuck in both the country and our relationship, as I was waiting for 8 months for him to propose as he said he wanted to. I only got a response of \"I'm tired from working, I want you to go to bed early do I can have private time gaming\". It hurt me but I tried to give him time to relax which was never enough.\n\nIn January, I got worked up with my thoughs about the proposal and why he wasn't even attempting to make it and he was only stonewalling me when I asked. This led to ugly fights with him saying he doesn't get enough time alone so I suggested he went to his homecity to stay with his friends for some time. He didn't listen until one morning early February when I started crying because he refused to go out to a pottery class or anywhere else and refused to discuss any date at home for Valentine's day. I was feeling abandoned as I wanted to spend time together and he just shut the conversation. As I was crying, he approached me saying \"Oh, I see you wanna fight again\", and I lost it telling him I hate him for making me feel unworthy of love and attention. I was leaving for gym and opening the door, when I noticed his keys were in the lock, so I threw them on the floor and left with mine. While I was at the gym, he packed up a few things, texted me smth like \"I accept your offer\" and left. I was shocked but I decided he needs time so I texted one of his friends assuming BF went to another city(he never said where he was going) to check on him and make sure he's ok. \n\nBF said he was not ready to talk for a week, so I wrote him a long letter about problems we had, apologizing for pushing him into buying rings and for demanding attention. After a week, I sent it, and he shortly replied telling me the same stuff about me being too clingy and him not being able to relax when I'm awake. He then wrote me about wanting to return but I was fed up with his response so I asked him to only pick up his stuff and find a place to take the second dog as I was tired from taking six walks a day everyday while working fulltime. \n\nHe came for his stuff, we cried a lot telling each other we still love each other a lot. I packed everything he'd need to be comfortable and he left. After another week I packed stuff for the dog and sent her to his place in a taxi for pets. \n\nIt's been almost a month and he never texted me first. I reached out to him about some errands, how the dog's doing, etc and he replied. This makes me unsure of his intentions. He says he's busy with his work and studying but I think he just doesn't want to reach out or doesn't understand we can be together only if he shows more effort. \n\nNow I'm unsure if I should fight for the relationship. I come from a family where \"keeping a man\" was my mother's primary interest even when it was clearly selfdestructing and it feels me with despair. I've been in relationships(my ex, then my current BF) for the last eight years and I feel pressure from my family being called irresponsible not being married with kids by 25 but I can't cut ties with them because of my litle sisters(11 and 6). If I fight, how do I tell him I want him to take more responsibility in our life together? How do I keep our boundaries clear and safe if weget back together?\n\nOr is it healthier to let go of this relationship? The thought of ending it is very painful and I don't get if it has already ended or not. This inbetween stage has taken its toll on me, as I'm currently not really able to eat or sleep or work as I should. I'm constantly thinking about it even when I try to keep myself busy building new furniture, painting, crocheting etc. I'm tired of reaching out to him and I don't know how to ask about our status without getting into a fight once again.\n\nI already talked about the whole thing with two of my best friends and they're on my side. One of them said I was dealing with the situation like a shaolin monk(lol) but honestly, on the inside I am a total mess. I can't really ask them for advice anymore as they have their own problems so I found the subreddit.

Our relationship lasted 1 year. It hurts so bad, but last night, I felt I had to do it.\n\n**The Reason:** My girlfriend has done a lot of things to hurt me in our relationship.\n\nShe has gaslighted me. She has made comments about my body. She has disrespected me in front of my friends and others. She has been incapable of resolving conflict without getting angry or frustrated quickly. One of her past exes who has been trying to get back with her even reached out to her and asked her out and she said \"I have plans this weekend' and didn't even bother to mention me. And it felt like every couple weeks by the end of our relationship, something was making me upset. And a lot of these things were issues because she never knew how to love properly in the first place. Her last relationship was physically and mentally abusive. She has quite a bit of family trauma. She is deeply insecure. She was aware of all the toxic tendencies she projected onto me and said she would try to change, but I would need to be patient. And I finally told her on call that I couldn't wait any longer and I called it quits. She didn't tear up or cry - but was just in pure shock. And we hung up.\n\n**The Regret:** But, on the other hand, I am now remembering all the things she has done to love me. The thing is - I know for a fact that she genuinely did love me.\n\nShe would push so hard for me to stay another night with her on weekends. If I was hungry, she would cook me food even if she didn't feel like it. When she saw me, she would genuinely say \"you're so beautiful\" in awe, and I know no one would ever say that and mean it like she did. She would grip my arm tightly when we were out. She said I was the first man she was proud to be with. Whenever I accidentally made a mess in her apartment, she forgave me so quickly. Or even when I slipped up and hurt her, she would be quick to forgive. She would show and introduce me to everyone she knew. And she was making change, but very gradually. She even tried to get therapy, but didn't have luck finding a therapist. I knew she was capable of changing entirely, but it would take so much time. I remember all these little things and I feel like I won't find someone who will love me as much as she does.\n\n**Now:** The night I broke up with her, I had the dream of reaching out to her and telling her I'll give her another chance and I'm sorry. I want to so bad. And I'm wondering if I even should, and how I could even go about doing it. Should I call her? Should I text her? How long should I wait? She has done so much to wrong me and clearly has issues she needs to work on, but I miss her so much...because she genuinely did love me.\n\nThe problem is is that for the past couple of months, I have hinted at wanting to break up with her. Whenever we argued, I would tell her to \"go find someone else\" or I would hint at having doubt or anxiety about the future. She has been so insecure about it and would tell me she feels like I'm not happy and I would lie because I couldn't pull through on breaking up. If I reached out, I feel like it would be even more confusing..but I sense she wouldn't be totally against. She understood why I was unhappy and knew she had things to work on. I think she would reply. At least I hope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I broke up with my gf last night and I already regret it. She has done so much to wrong me in our relationship, but I am remembering all the things she has done to show. she loved me too. I am confident no one will love me the way she did. I want to reach out to her, but not sure if I should bother or wait some days.

They would mainly just go get drinks together, etc. However when we started seeing each other and I would come around this woman would get pissy and I was told she didn\u2019t want me there when they where hanging out because we where too \u201clovey\u201d. The. One night the 3 of us where drinking at a bar and she had a breakdown after seeing us holding hands and stuff saying we where \u201ctoo much\u201d. After this I told my girl I didn\u2019t like her hanging out with this woman bc she wasn\u2019t right. So my woman started to distance herself, this woman still would ask to go do things but would get turned down. Fast forward to last weekend she offered my gf $200 to help clean her apartment up and assemble some furniture, she agreed bc of the extra cash, but she lives 25 mins away and said for her to just leave her car here and she\u2019d pick her up. I had to drive to her apartment to get my gf that night. Then she asked her to come Wednesday after work and help\/hangout so she leaves her car here again and then tells me that this woman changed the schedule at worked and gave her Thursday off to go 4 hours out of town to buy a car and that she did that without her knowing. I thought that was odd considering apparently she just did it and then roped her into a road trip. So she was supposed to come home last night late but I get a text saying that she was told by her supervisor (other woman) that is she was late to work she would get wrote up but if she stayed the night she mark it as a vacation day and she\u2019d drop her off today. So she stays another night and doesn\u2019t go to work today. And this morning I got a text saying that she asked if she could help with her kids birthday party and do her hair, my gf said she didn\u2019t want to stay for the party itself but could help.

We started out about 5 months after she first told her ex husband that she wanted a divorce. She never considered it an affair, and she always stated she would divorce him whether or not she was with me - and even if we didn't work out. He did consider it an affair, because while she had asked for a divorce, it hadn't been finalised.\n\nIn the process of her divorce, she and her ex husband sold the house, split custody of the children and she got a relatively poor settlement, and not enough money to re-invest. She would lose money on this settlement every month.\n\nShe moved in to my house, about 1 year after I split with my own ex wife, who I have an expensive settlement with and I have continued to struggle until now.\n\nFor the past 3 years, we've been living together with a patchwork family, and family life is amazing. However, she hasn't been working, she's seen her bank balance dwindle, even though the only thing she's ever contributed towards is the groceries. She now has half of her money remaining, and is starting to panic.\n\nI wish I was in a position to help, but I've been dealing with my own divorce expenses and baggage, so all I've been able to offer her is things in future (as well as paying for everything and dinners out etc). Now, I'm finally back on my feet again financially and ready to coinvest with her. However, in the last months she has started a job, and the way she has seen it is almost like a finger flip in my direction. Now I don't need you, kind of thing. Building her escape. She denies this, but she admits she's fed up of our relationship, has lost faith in me, accused me of BS'ing at the start of the relationship (I told her one day I would like to invest but that I was nowhere near able to yet). She sees it as me dangling a carrot. That infuriates her.\n\nShe resents me for everything that happened as a result of the divorce, losing her security, losing kids half the time, and accuses me of financially 'controlling' her simply because I offered her to live rent free in my house. She does not accept any responsibility personally for any of the above.\n\nShe has unbelievable anger and is on the verge of separating (I can tell), just as her faith in me was going to be rewarded and I was going to start giving back.\n\nIs there any way I can ever help her to get past this intense anger and resentment? She says she doesn't want to split but she also says she can't imagine a future or a way for us to combine, because she claims she is 'scarred' by what's happened.\n\nTL\/DR Girlfriend is dealing with massive resentment of me due to the consequences of her divorce, and I am wondering if there's any way to deal with this and move on.","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678454495.0},{"title":"I'm afraid my (23f) bf (23m) is going to leave me because I don't make enough money.","author":"xxnerdykittenxx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11nd6bi\/im_afraid_my_23f_bf_23m_is_going_to_leave_me\/","text":"My (23f) bf (23m) have been together for about 7 months. We met working together, we even became managers at the same time. The only difference is, he quit and got a different job and I stayed. At his new job, he has acended the ladder very quickly. He has gotten raises and promotions over a year of working there. I've stayed at the same level and pay, but I'm at least comfortable and happy in my position and I like who I work with. He works around 50 hours a week, I work half that, I also make half his pay, and he is already getting another promotion soon. I never dated him for money, he only treats me to dinner on date nights. He only bought me presents for Christmas and my birthday which is fine I got him something too. We both live with our own parents so rent isn't an issue, I just pay for essentials and he pays his. The problem...We were friends for about a year before dating. We used to talk so much all the time. We had elaborate long night talks. We joked all the time. Now, all he talks about is work. Every date has become him trying to concieve me to get a better job. I feel like I'm not good enough for him anymore. We haven't been intimate, kissed much, or done much together for months. He doesn't play video games with me anymore. He says they \"don't pay the bills\". He doesn't pay bills! He even makes me feel bad that I play video games when I'm off work. It's not my fault I allow myself to relax while all he does is work and college and we see eachother once a week. I've considered getting a new job just to keep him interested in me. I just want to feel like he loves me again, because right now I feel like he only loves his job. I've told him I'm happy at my job, that he works too much, and that enjoying life is as important as making money. He never listens. I feel like he even has a better relationship with his co-workers than with me cause I see videos of him laughing and making jokes with them on his snap chat while he is quiet around me. He also answers work calls and texts his work people while we are together. I don't want to lose him, but I fear he will choose work over me unless I can get through to him. How can I when nothing I say changes his desire to work constantly. \n\nTL;DR My boyfriend works all the time and makes good money while I'm at a job that makes me happy but pays less.

I couldn't interact with her before because I basically wasn't allowed in the same friend circle as my sister's, which my friend was in.\n\nI've kept my distance to my sister for the most part, but she was in a terrible accident a few years ago due to psychosis and we became close after that. And I somehow feel like I'm sacrificing my own identity to be in touch with her. She also blocked me from seeing her Instagram stories a few months for no reason and blocked one of our common friends. I feel like breaking contact with her would be the best solution but I also fear that some of her behavior may be due to her past psychosis and that she will relapse if I don't spend time with her or something. I read that psychosis can be caused by of lack of social contact. But she does seem to spend time with friends so maybe she'll be fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Therapist says that my sister(F26 has been gaslighting me most of my life and shows narcissistic traits.

My sister denies it but I feel like asking my friend how she knows it's true because it's bugging me and I struggle to understand the true nature of my sister.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678373849.0},{"title":"I [23M] have an irrational fear of commitment.

Every damn time it\u2019s the same process, only now there was something different. This time I REALLY felt the butterflies and I was so sure of her. But as soon as it became \u201cofficial\u201d I started panicking. \n\nHere\u2019s the process:\n\n**Persuit**.I meet a girl, I become smitten and I pursue. \n\n**Honeymoon**. This phase is all good, we are planning vacations. I imagine my future with her, and it makes me happy. Hell, I can even imagine getting married to this girl and starting a family. \n\n**The Turn**. It's not sudden, its gradual, but there's definitely a point where I peak, commitment-wise. I go from being the happiest boyfriend in the world, to the beginning of the decline. \n\n**Decline**. This can be days\/weeks or months. Eventually I get to the point where making any type of future plans gives me anxiety and I avoid any type of relationship talk. The more she pushes for commitment, the more I pull away. \n\n**Breakup**. My commitment phobia is at its peak and I view our relationship very similar to how a claustrophobic person would view an elevator. At this point I have completely disconnected from the relationship and I just want out. I look for problems\/reasons to break up without them being an actual problem.\n\n**Aftermath**. (Mostly, not this time) Immediately following the breakup I have an immense sense of relief. My anxieties are now gone. \n\n**Rekindled love.** With my commitment fears gone, I now look at my ex like I did when I was pursuing - what an awesome girl she is, what was I thinking! She\u2019s perfect! Maybe I should go back to her! (I never do because I can\u2019t risk hurting them more than I have.)\n\n**Background**. I\u2019ve had 1 relationship wich lasted 2 years.

(Formely lived in a small... town or village I guess you could call it).\n\nAll my life I was taught and used to living very frugally; up until a year ago when I started opening up a bit I barely spent any money on anything (lived with my mom), only food and the occassional recreational\/hobby something once every month or two but that's it.\n\nTwo months ago I started dating this super amazing girl (21F) and I'm really into her, I really like her, I can absolutely imagine a long-term relationship with her, but it's still very early into our dating and we're taking things slow.\n\nOn our first few dates I paid for both of us (which honestly physically made me a little uncomfortable to spend that much money that frequently, but I tried my best to keep it inside), then on a few dates I asked if we could pay half\/half and she agreed, saying it was no problem. Then one night I had an open conversation with her and we discussed \"gender expectations\" and paying on dates, so I took this opportunity to ask her what she thinks of men paying everything on dates, and she explained she see's it as the guy's way of proving to the girl that he wants to spend his time with her and that she is important to him.\n\nI suppose I see it a little differently, I believe everything should be as fair and equal as possible so why shouldn't the women pay her fair share on dates\/shared expenses? I did listen to her though and tried my best to understand and I can see the point she's making it; she basically saying it's romantic for the men to pay to show his appreciation and his desire to be with the women.\n\nI must admit I'm also a little self-concious about her \"using\" me to go on free dates. I really like her, and I already trust her to a degree, but I don't know her that well, we met from online dating so it's not like we got a mutual friend that can vouch for her or something.\n\nI checked my finances for the past month and saw that for the first time since I started working, I used more money than I made during that month. This isn't a big deal, thanks to me saving and living frugally I got quite a bit saved up, but it still hurt a little to see I wasn't able to save up more money from the past month. Obviously not all of last month expenses were from dates, but I'm sure paying for two people in restaraunts\/other places several times a week didn't help.\n\nSo my basic plan for the near future is to keep spoiling her and paying for dates and stuff, as best as I can. I'm doing my best to tell myself it's a \"long-term investment\" and not just a waste of money to legitimize it inside my head as much as possible. My hope is that eventually, if\/when we move past the dating\/honeymoon phase we could split expenses more evenly\/fairly, of course that will also require more open conversations and compromises as we build our relationship together, it won't be easy but that won't stop me.\n\nI guess my question is: Is this a good plan? Is it considered normal for the men to pay for the women on \"so many\" dates? (\"so many\" in quotes because that could be subjective and I'm a relatively frugal guy). I want to make her happy and for us to have a great time and a future but not if it means me going broke and destroying my financial future.\n\nI should also mention of course that she works part-time and is studying in university, so maybe it would make more sense for me to pay for her more because she earns much less than me and is busy studying.\n\nTLDR: Started dating a new amazing girl, she's the best, but I'm a little uncomfortable paying for both of us on so many dates and would love some advice\/guidance.\n\n**EDIT\/conclusion:** Thanks for all the wonderful advice everyone! Of course feel free to post further advice if you wish, but I got my plan for how to proceed now thanks to your help...\n\nHer and I are planning to meet again in a few days, so I'll bring this very important issue up then.\n\nI won't mention the \"not saving up any money in the last month\" part because that's not her problem\/issue, but basically I'll just explain how I want to be more responsible financially and save up money for the future (hopefully buying my own property in the next few years) and so that's why I want us to be more equal when paying for dates, or going on cheaper dates, or both, etc.\n\nIt can be hard to see red-flags, even if they are in front of your face when you're blinded by love, so during the conversation I'll try to remember that if she says something like \"you want to spend less money on me just shows you're not interested\/invested in me\" or her being less affectionate\/invested as \"revenge\" from the conversation then that would show incompability\/red-flag.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678363519.0},{"title":"I (21 F) feel gaslit by my bf (20 M) HELP","author":"Strong_Razzmatazz_39","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11nerib\/i_21_f_feel_gaslit_by_my_bf_20_m_help\/","text":"\n\nI (21F) feel so confused.

I meet many people that way, of all ages\/genders. I do my best to be nice & kind to everyone. I just want people to feel included for who they are, I\u2019ve always been that way. \n\nWhen I first met Brock I didn\u2019t care about what his age was, he had a deepish voice and seemed somewhat mature so I assumed he was 25-27. I don\u2019t ask people their age because it doesn\u2019t matter or contribute to the game, so I think it\u2019s creepy to ask.\n\nI ended up making a really good group of OL friends, some including my HS friends. There were two guys, including Brock. Brock and the other guy Darren became best buds. Brock was newest to the group, but for months he & Darren became inseparable. One night Brock invited his irl friend to play & Darren got super mad\/weird about it, like jealous. He ended up being rude to us all, especially Brock\u2019s friend, & even left our group chat. Brock was upset\/confused about the whole thing & eventually we found out Darren had removed us all from the game. Then Darren started messaging Brock privately as if nothing happened. Every time Darren did something new Brock would call\/text me and talk to me about it until we both agreed to just block him since he was causing unnecessary drama which isn\u2019t our vibe at all.\n\nAfter all that our group didn\u2019t play as much & it slowly became just Brock & I trying to get the group to play with us with no response. I\u2019ll admit that as we played more alone together, I started to like Brock. He was kind, sweet, caring, & funny. We told each other all kinds of stories & would just be laughing constantly. I since it was OL I didn\u2019t pursue it or anything.\n\nEventually over a few months we gained a new group of friends, & they asked us how old we were. That was when I found out Brock was only 21. That halted my crush quite a bit but I found myself getting lost in the fun we had playing, I\u2019d kinda forget about his age. I didn\u2019t think he had a crush on me anyway since now he knew I was so much older. He treats everyone the same regardless of who they are, just like I do. So again didn\u2019t think much of it. When he was friends with Darren they talked all the time too, calling each other for hours.\n\nRecently he\u2019s opened up to me about how he\u2019s only ever had one gf & doesn\u2019t like any girls his age. He told me how he had flings with older women (F28-34) but they never dated or kissed, that he just liked them for a while & it fizzled out. He also sent me a photo of a girl who was closer to his age-27 that his friends were trying to hook him up with but she had a kid so he knew it wouldn\u2019t work out long term as he didn\u2019t want that. One night he brought up how he wishes I could come out with some of the people we play with so we could all hang out. He also said the same to Darren and all of us previously, so this wasn\u2019t anything new. He just wants to have fun with us all in person since we all got on so well online.\n\nCouple weeks later he said that he likes me. I said he doesn\u2019t even know me but he insisted that he does cuz we have talked about so many things. That he hasn\u2019t felt this way about anyone in his town & he\u2019s never liked a girl he talks to only over the phone before. I told him I was flattered & liked him too but its inappropriate because of my age. He said he doesn\u2019t care about that & likes me for who I am. He thinks older women are \u201cbetter\u201d anyway because all the girls he knows his age have nothing to talk about & sleep around but sex is more important to him than that, which is why he hasn\u2019t hooked up with anyone in a few years. His friend group has a ton of friends & party all the time so he\u2019s had opportunities to hook up with other people if he wanted to. I do really like\/care about him, and he was very adamant that he doesn\u2019t care about my age even though I\u2019ve protested it multiple times.\n\nWe have now gotten to the point where we talk even more, sometimes multiple nights in a row whether we are playing the game or not. He gets up super early for work so he always messages me good morning, he gets sad when I tell him I can\u2019t talk, but he\u2019s always really nice\/understanding about it. I try to put some distance between us & do my own things without talking to him, or when he wants to call me on his drive home from work I think up excuses why I can\u2019t talk. But when I do, it seems to make him like me even more. I like him a lot and want the best for him, which makes me have a really hard time with this.\n\nWhen I was younger, older guys constantly used me for my body & preyed on me because they were my bosses, managers, or whatever. I look back and some of the relationships were kinda hot (I was 18-22 and they were 38-45) but some make me cringe cuz they were so creepy & not even attractive, but at the time being young I thought they were mature & had their shit together when they didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never dated or been involved with anyone more than 2 years younger than me, so this is completely new to me & I\u2019m not sure how to navigate this or if I\u2019m being over-dramatic.\n\nBottom line: I cannot unsee this situation as if the roles were reversed and I was some creepy 30yo dude talking this much to a 21yo girl. One of my friends is 31M dating 20F & I secretly lost a bit of respect for him over it. I\u2019m torn because ever since I turned 27 & realized how I actually felt about those past relationships I was in, I\u2019ve strongly felt that type of age gap to be an unfair dynamic in a romantic relationship. But I started to like him before I knew how young he was, so there\u2019s also a piece of my brain that still sees him as the 25-27yo I thought he was for months.\n\nI\u2019ve told him all of this, & he still insists that I\u2019m not creepy & that his friend likes me too. He loves how nice\/sweet\/kind I am & how we can talk about anything. He really wants to come visit me or have me come visit him. He started saying that he finally feels like he would want to hook up with someone, that he hasn\u2019t felt that type of spark in a long time. I\u2019m beyond flattered but I also just really can\u2019t get past thinking this is so wrong. Like I said, I can\u2019t unsee the fact that if the roles were reversed this would be honestly, in my opinion, absolutely disgusting.\n\nAny thoughts\/advice much welcomed\n\nTLDR: I started to develop a crush with my online friend and later found out he was 21, but since I\u2019m basically ten years older I feel like a creep, especially when I think about if the roles were reversed.","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1678396705.0},{"title":"My (28M) wife (28F) wants to drag me to our high school reunion.

Me and my wife are writing this together because we need an external opinion on this situation. We will write both sides of the problems.\n\n\\- English is not our first language so sorry for any mistake.\n\nI will start with my side of the problem:\n\nI (28M) have been going out with Lily (28F) for 10 years, married for 4. We have known each other since the beginning of High school. I have to specify this since our high school years are the core of the question: we hated our high school years. We were both outcast. We were bullied, laughed at and we were the butt of the jokes most of the times. This was mostly due to our appearance. I was fat, still wore a brace and suffered from asthma ( I fainted a couple of times during PE). For me, HS was bad but it was not my first time dealing with bullies, as I had to do it during middle school too ( mostly for the same reasons). While this didn't make HS more bearable, I at least didn't have the \"shock\" of suddenly being picked on. Lily was my only friend and, throughout the 5 years of HS, I developed a crush on her and ended up confessing shortly before graduation, when I found out we were going to attend the same college. We have been dating ever since. \n\nAfter graduating HS, we both bloomed. My asthma subsided, I removed the brace ( finally!) and I was finally able to start doing sport and lost a lot of weight.\n\nAfter graduating college, we both got a good paying job are doing fine now ( we aren't rich but we are quite wealthy). Once we were stable enough, I proposed to her and we got married. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, we received a mail for our 10 year HS reunion. It will be in July. I don't want to go. Before someone ask, it's not for any kind of complex or fear. I simply think we have come so far from those bad days and I don't see a reason to go to an event where you are meant to remember those moment. Lily insists we go and basically show off ( I'm paraphrasing but that's the gist of it).\n\nOk, my side of the problem is over so I will let Lily write hers. Bye.\n\nHi Reddit, Lily here. How are you doing? Hopefully well. So, I will try to sum things up as much as possible in order to not annoy any of you. \n\nHS was a crappy period. I suffered from a grave case of acne and my body didn't develop until I was 17 so I became a target for bullies and mean girls. It's embarrassing to admit but I used to cry a lot at the time. If I could, I would erase those year from my mind but there was one good thing that happened in those years that makes it worth it: I met Leo. He was also bullied and yet he kept smiling to me and moving on despite everything. He made those unbearable days a little less shitty and at the same time, he made me hate those people even more: I was shy, introvert and had uncommon taste both in music and cinema so I can understand being picked on by bullies. Leo is a kind spirit, he always was like that and he always tried to be friend with everybody he knew. Why were they picking on him? Why did they have to make him feel so miserable? I could literally see how hurt he was every time he tried to fit in only to be shunned again. Why? Just why?\n\nWe have been through a lot together and we kept moving on against all odds.\n\nWe recently got an invitation for our HS reunion. Leo says I want to go just to show off and, well, yeah, I do. I want to show to my former classmates how far we have come, how much we have grown since those days. I think it would be cathartic for the both of us. Leo disagrees. He says that the best way to prove how much we have grown is to simply move on from the whole thing and enjoy our life. While from a logical pov I agree, from a sentimental pov, I want to go anyway.\n\nWe want to thank in advance everybody for their opinion and advice.

They don\u2019t know I have anxiety and believe I hate them because I don\u2019t show up to a lot of their family functions. Do you have any advice or words of wisdom? \n\n\n\n\nMY BACKGROUND : \nI\u2019ve been dealing with social anxiety and depression for most of my life. It seems like it has gotten worse as I\u2019ve aged and sadly it\u2019s putting a strain on my relationship with my gf and her family. Much like everyone on the planet, I have my good and bad days. Id say I have about 3 good day each week, followed by 4 bad ones where even making my bed is a challenge. My bad days oftentimes leave me feeling anxious, overwhelmed, weak, pathetic, sad, angry, and overall helpless. In general, it\u2019s very hard to converse with others when you feel uncomfortable in your own skin.\n\n\nSITUATION:\nI\u2019ve dated my girlfriend for almost 4 years. Her family is very religious and hosts lots of direct family get togethers. Most of those events are sports oriented, followed by the usual birthdays and holidays. I\u2019m not much of a sports guy so I find it hard to attend those gatherings because it\u2019s usually just me sitting on the couch pinching\/picking at my skin because I think that everyone is judging me about how awkward I\u2019m being. Most of the time I don\u2019t know what to do with myself at their house so i just stand out of everyone\u2019s way, speak when spoken to, and do my best not to fall over and die. You can probably imagine why I have issues attending get togethers. It\u2019s like placing my hand on a hot stove top knowing damn well it\u2019s going to burn my hand. Im not going to want to do it. \n\n\nISSUE:\nMy girlfriend has jumped on my case about not attending her family\u2019s gatherings. She says that she feels weird because everyone else has their SOs with them and she\u2019s just by herself. \nHer family cracks jokes about me being a ghost because I never show up to things and they have this idea that I hate them. \nRecently my GF\u2019s oldest sister had a birthday party, but I couldn\u2019t attend because people in my house have covid. Because of this, her dad made a comment stating that they\u2019ll never see her again if we end up getting married. Apparently, my GF\u2019s middle sister was\/is pissed at me for not showing up either. This may have been fueled by me missing my girlfriend\u2019s birthday party a couple months ago because I had a stomach bug. I celebrated my gf\u2019s birthday alone with her the day before I got sick, so it\u2019s not like I forgot. \nI hardly ever speak about myself to anyone so they don\u2019t know what kind of mental issues I deal with. \n\n\nMY THOUGHTS:\nMy girlfriend is valid for feeling the way she does. If the roles were reversed I would also want her at my family events too. However, I feel like her family gets together more than most. \nI think her dad was out of pocket when he made that comment. Even if we were married it\u2019s not like I could\/would force her not to show up to their family functions. \n\n\nQUESTION: \nWhat do I do in this situation? Do I need to disclose to her family that I\u2019m just fucked in the head and would gladly be at their gatherings if it weren\u2019t for that? Im at my wits end because I don\u2019t think I can change quickly enough for them. Perhaps the expectation of me being there would be different if my gf and I were actually engaged\/married. I just don\u2019t know what to do. Perhaps I\u2019m just not healthy enough to be in any kind of relationship.","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1678414547.0},{"title":"Me [17 M] with girl I've been talking to [17 F].

I didn't understand so I asked why not just tell the truth.\n\nFirst they said, they didn't want the ex bothering them and said the ex has been nice to them lately. But when I pressed the issue, they said \"I didn't want them to start bothering you.\" I told my partner that didn't make sense as the ex probably didn't believe the scammer lie anyways and I asked them why not just tell the ex the text wasn't for them. \n\nNow my partner says I'm tripping. Should I address it or should I let it go? Do you feel like I'm tripping? \n\nBackstory: ex is cray cray. They do make life a living hell with their shared child. The ex is nice when they think we're not together. They have been separated 3 years. The ex is used to telling my partner what to do, how to do it and when to do it. \n\nAnyways, we've talked in the past about the ex being controlling  and dictating my partner's life and I feel like my partner's actions today continue to feed into the ex's bad behavior. I can't get my partner to see it but now I'm feeling like maybe I am tripping. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nTLDR: my partner accidentally texted their ex and when they realized they called the ex and lied saying it was a scammer that texted. When I asked, why lie, my partner said because they didn't want the ex to start bothering me again.","upvote_ratio":0.29,"created_utc":1678466887.0},{"title":"Help with adhd","author":"M0U53YBE94","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11n46jv\/help_with_adhd\/","text":"How do I 28m explain adhd to my 33m partner.

Over the last year I\u2019ve noticed quite a bit of red flags and have ignored them up until recently when I realized that I may not be in a healthy relationship. For a bit of context we are both each other\u2019s first serious relationships and have moved in together 3 hours away from home. So I just graduated from college in December and have been living with him for the last 2 months. \n\nA little backstory we did a trial run last summer and he was in charge of finding an apartment for us and didn\u2019t find an apartment until a week before he needed to be at his new job. During the time from when he graduated to when he needed to be at his new job was only a month. At that time I was still dealing with finals and at the end of may I had a friend who committed suicide and one of my really good friends tried to commit suicide. During that time I was in a very difficult situation with my mental health and that continued through the summer and I was really depressed and stressed about everything and my anxiety really got to me and I didn\u2019t have any of my support system near me. I ended up moving back to college in August for my final semester and I still had trouble with my mental health but I was much better. During that summer and fall me and my boyfriend had hit some really rough patches and there wasn\u2019t a lot of communication between us. And during that time I met a friend who challenged me to think for myself and what I really wanted.Along with my mom and friends trying to tell me all the red flags about my boyfriend while I ignored them. \n\nI came to the realization of these red flags which are talks very condescending to me, doesn\u2019t like to do what I want to do, expects me to clean the entire apartment without any help from him, and the main problem is he says his adhd makes everything so much harder and uses it as an excuse to not help with things and that\u2019s just naming a few things. And this realization came when he made me feel bad about doubling his time on what was supposed to be a quick trip to the gas station because I asked him to get me some fast food instead of gas station food.\n\nThat day I was already scattered brain because the friend that challenged me to think for myself asked me to be friends with benefits. I considered it because I liked how I felt when I was with him and he did know about my boyfriend. And he said after some conversation about it \u201cyou are using me to cope because you are unhappy with your relationship\u201d and that made me realize it was true that I was unhappy and my boyfriend making me feel bad about having him get me food turned into a full break down in my car.\n\nNow I will say I have tried to bring up some of the issues that I have had in the past and we have talked about it but it then never gets a solution or resolved. I have broke down in his arms trying to say that I wasn\u2019t happy but it never got through to him and after that I just ignored it and went through the motions which I have been for the last year I believe. \n\nNow currently I am back home taking a few days and luckily I was planning on coming home to support some of my friends in my college musical which is only 20 minutes away from my home so I had an excuse to leave for a couple of days. I have not talked to him about any of this but I don\u2019t think I can live with him anymore and I\u2019m not even totally sure if I still want to be in a relationship with him. I do love him but I have grown as a person and he really hasn\u2019t changed since high school. And I think I need to figure out what to do for myself and what it\u2019s like to be single since I have been with him for a third of my life. \n\nSo my question is do I ask for space and move out and back home. Or do I break up with him when I am not emotionally prepared to do that and have not talked to him about this yet because once I do I am most likely going to have to move out. And the space will probably lead to a break up but he will be completely blindsided by the breakup and I don\u2019t know what my priorities are right now. I do want to include that I don\u2019t have a job at the moment and my mom will let me live with her and my sister again. The only thing is he works a hybrid remote job so I don\u2019t know when he will be in the office so when I do move out I don\u2019t have to have him watching me move all of my stuff out. Also for a timeline I had the conversation with my friend on Sunday along with the break down and then left on Tuesday morning and have been home ever since. And I\u2019m sorry this is so scattered and long it is very hard collecting all my thoughts into one post. I\u2019m just so confused on what to do and would like some input from other people. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR\nMe 20F and my boyfriend 24M have been together for 6 years and I had a realization of all the red flags and it\u2019s not a healthy relationship and I\u2019m not happy.

However, this process was never quite conclusive and I wasn't 100% sure that I should break up with her but in the end I did it anyways because of multiple reasons:\n\n* I didn't want to repeat the mistake of my previous relationship where we stayed together for at least a year longer than we should have, because none of us was ready to be alone, even though we didn't \"really\" love each other anymore.\n* I felt like I didn't \"love\" her anymore, however I wasn't 100% sure here, as I still deeply cared about her and liked to make her happy.\n* My friends, after talking with them more or less leaned into the direction of \"break up with her\", problem is that they only ever heard me talk about it when I was doubting \/ ranting or even while drinking so I can't know if they had a really \"unbiased\" view. After the breakup most of them said \"as long as you think it's the right decision\" since they all really liked her.\n* I told myself \"the sooner you break it off, the less hurtful it will be for her in the long run. Also it's not fair for her to be in a relationship where she doesn't get the love she deserves\"\n* I broke up and didn't just \"take a break\" because I felt like that's unfair and usually leads to a breakup anyways.\n\nI didn't want to talk to her about all of this before breaking up with her, as I felt like it would only prolong the hurt and I thought she wouldn't really have been able to do something against \"my romantic interest in you is fading.\"\n\n**The Break up**\n\nThe break up itself was really bad. I sat her down and told her that I lost the interest in a romantic relationship with her and that I wouldn't find it fair for her to pursue a relationship where she won't get as much back. She cried a lot and we ended it on \"good\" terms, meaning I broke her heart but we agreed to talk as soon as possible and would try to stay friends after a period of \"no contact\" (as long as needed from both sides) so we both could get over it.\n\n**After the Break up**\n\nThe first few weeks were kind of ok, I was really sad but kind of happy that I finally \"did\" it. I wasn't even 100% sure it was the right thing, but I figured I'd need some more time and see that it was the right decision. I spent a lot of time with friends, trying to become more healthy (workout \/ healthy habits and eating) and focussed on work, not even trying to date anyone or meet new people.\n\nAfter the first month was over, I texted her once, saying the if she ever wants to talk (like we initially said during the break-up itself) I'd be there but that I don't want to push her and that I'd understand if she needs more time. She told me that she needed more time and we haven't had contact since.A week later the doubts started getting more and more serious.\n\n**Now**\n\nNow, two months later I am heavily regretting the decision and thinking that I shouldn't have done it in the first place. Still haven't reached out to her and so on as I don't want to do anything impulsive. Thinking back I feel like I convinced myself that I wasn't in love with her anymore because I just compared the honeymoon phase to the \"normalcy\" phase and then convinced myself to break up as early as possible to not repeat previous mistakes. But we never really had any problems, matched perfectly and at this point I can see myself spending many more years with her. Then again, the decision to break up with her was made after already multiple months of pondering, making lists and weighing pros and cons. It could very well be a normal phase of post-breakup blues.\n\nTo try to see it more rationally, I have again made pro \/ con lists and since two weeks I've also been tracking a daily \"do I want her back\" list where I answer that question each day after reading, editing and re-reading the pro \/ con list. So far it has been a resounding \"YES\".\n\n**Current thoughts**\n\nCurrently I'm thinking of giving it at least another month while keeping up the whole journaling \/ list stuff, to not do anything impulsive or even hurt her healing process while doing so. Should I wait a bit longer and see how I feel? Then again there is of course this nagging feeling that she'll completely move on if I wait to long, which I know is a complete asshole thing to say and I hate myself for it but it nevertheless is in the back of my mind.\n\nShould I try to win her back? If yes, how would I approach it best so as to regain her trust and not  hurt and confuse her?\n\nShould I keep with my plan of waiting? Any other similar experiences from the community here?\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nBroke up with my girlfriend of two years because of fading interest \/ romantic connection from my side, but not being 100% sure about it. After two months it feels like I really did the wrong thing and my heart is screaming to try to get her back instead of keeping no contact as planned.","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1678452601.0},{"title":"How do I (M22) explain to my family I\u2019m in a throuple relationship?

Later found out we had several friends in common.\nShe's nice, kind of an introvert (k-popper, weeb...) And both share some similarities both in interest as in life experiences.\n\nWe had our first date after 2 weeks of chatting, as she seems to be really busy. I invited her to a nice japanese restarurant. date went great, talked a lot and got to know each other pretty easily. She would laugh a lot and in general had a really positive attitude.\n\nAfter we finished there, we walked to a near place to hangout, with a nice view, just in front of some popular nightclubs and bars. She told me she wasn't really comfortable going inside such places, so decided to just stay there and continue talking. I noticed she would avoid any kind of physical contact, which I totally respect and understand. Eventually, she told me that her last relationship ended due to his ex cheating on her around a year ago, ending a relationship that lasted 6 years. We changed subjects and continued talking until eventually she said it was time to head back home.\nI then took a cab and acompanied her back to her place. We both hugged, said thanks and farewells, I joked about she owing me an ice cream for the next date, and I then left to my place.\n\nNext days we would continue texting, but noticed that she would often skip answering for long periods of time, often 6 hours or more, just to show up later or the next day greeting and wishing a good day as if nothing. I found this behavior as weird, since I wouldn't understand if she was interested or not in keep hanging out.\n\nSo a few days later I tried to arrange a second meeting, but she would constantly find a reason to not hang out (she was going to the park at night to exercise, meeting some friends, headache...). Eventually, after a week of trying, I managed to agree for a meeting on Sunday afternoon: a walk at the park with my dog and then going for some ice cream. \nHowever, when time came, she never showed up and later excused herself, as she had what she described as an awful headache, so she took a medication that apparently caused her to fall asleep. She then proposed to meet anytime during that week (this week) to meet after work.\n\nHowever, once again, she would find reasons to not do so (started feeling sick, hanged out with some friends). Lastly, tonight, she had bought tickets for a new movie at the cinema with a girl friend of her at late afternoon. So then I offered to go out for dinner after the movie ended, to which she just answered with \"I usually eat at the cinema\". I just replied with an \"ok\" and decided it was enough. After some time, at late night, she suddenly texted me with a \"hey, what are you doing?\" Which I just ignored.\n\n At this point, I don't know what to do. I really like her, and she'd be really nice and open to me in person, but the rest of the time she'd behave in an oddly manner, showing an on and off interest, constantly disappearing and not committing to anything. She's leaving tomorrow for an event outside the city and coming back in a week, one day before I leave for about a month.\n\nI feel I should try to ask her in a straightforward manner on what are her expectations, and if she's not interested, just leave.

He has a job but rarely goes because he doesn\u2019t want to stop playing video games or if he does go he won\u2019t sleep the night before so he can play video games all day - that\u2019s another thing he rarely ever sleeps or eats or showers it is really bad.\n\nHis parent consistently took away his video games when we were in our final year at high school around exam times and during that time he was incredibly angry and irritable. \n\nHe has ADHD and so I understand that the video games give him a high increase in dopamine every few minutes or so.\n\nHe lies to his family about how often he plays video games however I do suspect that they are realising it has become a problem. However both of his parents are incredibly busy and as much as they love their kids they sometimes don\u2019t have time to just have an hour long chat unless it\u2019s something really bad or really important so there has always been some disconnect between him and his parents especially because his parents were both finishing their degrees when he was born so he was brought up mainly by his aunt and grandma, his aunt has just had a baby and his grandma is really sick at the moment. \n\nHe has wasted two years of his life so far and it is only getting worse, I\u2019ve heard some storied about people wasting 6-12 years of their life and loosing their jobs or never being able to complete their education and loosing everybody that care about them. \n\nI\u2019m lost and idk what to do to help. I feel like if I say something to his parents I am destroying his trust in me as he also has trouble trusting people but every time I try to talk to him about it he either shuts down and refuses to talk about it or he gets mad and won\u2019t talk to me. I think he knows it\u2019s a problem but doesn\u2019t know how to help himself. \n\nHe also has a therapist but he has never once talked to her about any of this stuff, and consistently lies about everything from his emotions and study to basic basic things like that I live in a different state.\n\nI have tried suggesting that he joins the military because where I live they offer structure for his life, an actual degree at the end and pay him to attend and in return all they require is 3 years of mandatory service (we have both done scouts and military trying in high school) and so he genuinely does love it, and he is considering it but is worried that he won\u2019t be able to play video games as this training\/education program is in an actual training facility and not at home.\n\nTLDR; he is wasting his teenage\/early 20s by playing video games as he has no friends, no passions, no goals and is possibly going to get kicked out of college for it","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678423170.0},{"title":"Have I (25F) been lovebombed and manipulated, or is he (30M) genuine?","author":"ThrowRApurplecats","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11n3d3x\/have_i_25f_been_lovebombed_and_manipulated_or_is\/","text":"Timeline of important breakdown:\n\n1. October 2022: Him (30M) and I (25F) met. I get easily attached, and in the beginning even I was off-put by his forwardness. He said it was fate, he was telling me how he told all of his friends about me, I was meeting his friends, love at first sight, calling me all the time. It seemed genuine and I let my guard down after awhile and we got very close fast. He started spending a lot of time at my apartment and still does. He lives with his parents but is at my place more.\n\n2. Nov.-Dec.: His ex is still contacting him. He explains that his ex was abusive physically and emotionally, the texts he showed me\/her criminal record back up what he says. He sets boundaries that they will never be together again, shows me the texts, I am comfortable with this because he\u2019s transparent. \n\n3. New Years: I say I love you for the first time. He said it before me but I didn\u2019t say it back at the same time.\n\n3. January 2023: He loses his license from a previous issue where he lost it and didn\u2019t handle the paperwork properly (insurance related). I looked up his record and know what happened, he did not commit a crime. \n\n4. Jan-Feb: Because of the driving situation, he needed a lot of support with rides and finances because he wasn\u2019t able to work. He started a new job in Feb, I helped him a lot with covering food, giving him rides, letting him stay with me a lot. Now that he\u2019s more financially stable, he has helped out with groceries and gas.\n\n5. Feb.: I see a random text pop up from his ex, I question him about it, he lies multiple times, turns out she sent him a nude and he responded \u201chawt.\u201d I never got to see the texts but I did try and he since deleted them. I ended things in the moment when he admitted that. His ex\u2019s parents also renewed his car insurance for him. \n\nMy anxiety is not great. One second, I\u2019m anxious I\u2019m being used and taken advantage of, the next I\u2019m sympathizing of how difficult his situation is right now and do believe his ex was abusive and he claims he felt a sick need to please her and play into her antics. He described the picture she sent and it did not sound sexy and sounded more funny and was from when they were together. He said he didn\u2019t feel anything from the picture. \n\nHe has since told his ex he\u2019s seeing someone and to not to contact him, and blocked her on everything. She even went as far as contacting his mom which IMO does show that she\u2019s not stable. Please keep in mind there\u2019s way more background I\u2019m not explaining to try to keep this concise, but she genuinely sounds abusive.\n\nI\u2019ve still been helping him with rides after a few weeks and letting him stay with me a lot. I really can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being taken advantage of or if he\u2019s genuine. Any advice is welcome.

I unfortunately am not in the position to leave, but could use some pointers on how to effectively respond when these comments are made. I have had people tell me that I come across as mean towards my partner, but I just honestly feel like I'm at the point where if I don't become slightly assertive then he will continue to walk all over me and continue trying to control me\/my life. \n\nBackstory: \n\nWe have been married almost 10 years.\n\nHe often makes comments about what I wear out in public, specifically towards leggings and that he can see my \"ass\" (not see-through leggings, but just being able to see panty lines). I stopped wearing underwear with leggings for a while because of this. Fairly recently, I was getting changed for bed and he saw that I was wearing panties and spent a few minutes questioning me as to why I was wearing them. He has also, on more than one occasion, made comments to me when he has seen other men \"checking me out\".. the most recent occurrence was worded as \"don't think I didn't see that\".\n\nLast week I got home from work, showered&shaved, went up to bed.. he immediately noticed I had shaved and kept asking why, then proceeded to accuse me of sleeping with coworkers. I legitimately just laughed because of how ridiculous his accusation was.\n\nI had spent an extra 15 minutes at work a few days before, only because we work with 2 people on a shift and then have to give turnover. I enjoy talking with the lady who relieved me so I spent a little extra time speaking with her. He had called me the minute I was supposed to be leaving, I sent him a message saying I was still at work and then called him back when I was walking out to my car. He asked what I was doing, why I hadn't left yet and quickly became pretty stern saying \"it's time to come home\". \n\nHe becomes visibly annoyed when I pick up overtime, even if it's during times that he is at work as well. If I get mandated for a shift or any minor inconvenience occurs, he will tell me that I need to quit my job (despite it being a well-paying position with good benefits, a pension and carrying health insurance for our family). It is very upsetting on my part because I know the risks\/sacrifices that come with my job and it is what I agreed to. \n\nWe also had an incident come up about 2 years ago where I caught him taking unclothed photos of me without my knowledge, and come to find out there was 40+ more photos I didn't know about. He didn't see a problem with it because we're married, but my thoughts are: he could have just asked, and if he didn't think it was wrong, why do it so many times without my knowledge? As someone who has past trauma, it did not sit well with me and gave me increased anxiety. When I confronted him,  he initially denied it. Then, I told him I already saw the pictures and asked how many he had, he lied again and said there were 10. Continuing to lie to me and then trying to tell me that because he's my husband it's okay. \n\nA little over a year ago I overcame a fear of mine and began seeing a therapist 1x per week (I have since stopped going) When he caught wind of me going, he questioned why and asked why I couldn't just talk to him about things\/my problems. He was bothered that I wanted to discuss my life with a stranger, but not with him.  In his defense, I did not tell him I would be seeing a therapist, but only because I knew just how he would react. However, there have been moments where I tried to talk to him about things and get no response\/feedback\/validation whatsoever because he \"doesn't know what to say\", which is very discouraging on my part and makes it difficult to open up. \n\nAnd most recently, I bought a new pair of jeans - they're baggy jeans, not form-fitting by any means. They're not a style I'd typically purchase for myself so I texted him as we are working opposite schedules so I wouldn't be seeing him.. and told him I purchased them and wasn't sure how I felt. One of the first few things he said is \"who else did you show?\" And tried playing it off like he just wanted to know what they thought. I just don't feel like this is a normal response??? If he were to send me a picture of let's say, his haircut.. my first thought wouldn't be \"who else did you show?\" Like I legitimately didn't even know how to respond to that and I feel like any time I try to speak up for myself an argument ensues and it isn't even worth it.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678420528.0},{"title":"Seriously thinking of breaking up with my(F22) boyfriend(m31)","author":"MangoPuddingg","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11ndq4a\/seriously_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_myf22\/","text":"This is the healthiest relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and for the 2 years we\u2019ve been together have been great but the past few months something just feels off. \n\nLately I\u2019ve been fantasizing more and more about other men.

My boyfriend and I don't live together and we only see each other about once a week on the same day every week but spend the entire day together typically at my house. I was terrified and embarrassed but I told him what I discovered. I could have gotten it a few places, I stayed with my parents over the holidays and in the summer of last year my brother brought home bed bugs to their house. By Christmas time it was all taken care of so we didn't think much of it but I stayed in the room with the chair that originally was in my brother's room. I also have to travel semi frequently due to doctors appointments and stay in decently cheap hotels so that could also have done it. After confessing my new unfortunate problem to him he told me that we won't see each other until I have 100% without a doubt have gotten rid of them. Half of me understood and half of me was extremely hurt that he wouldn't even remotely consider seeing me in public spaces and allowing me to do preventive measures so I wouldn't transfer them to him. I obviously would never ever want to give them to him but it was super hurtful nonetheless. At the moment I'm unemployed and on disability for my chronic illness and obviously have little money because of that. Even so I jumped through hoops to contact an exterminator and finally got one to come to my house for an inspection that costed $300. They did indeed confirm that I have bed bugs but they said the good news is it's a very minor infestation and he was proud of all the work I had done thus far in my own attempts to treat them. I was feeling so heartbroken and abandoned that I was super willing to dish out money to basically get my boyfriend back but when it was revealed how much it was going to cost I could not afford it.

Once, in grad school, I ended up in an emotionally abusive relationship where the person threatened to ruin my life, somehow took my friends (I don't know what was said to them), and outed me to my family to punish me for breaking up with them.

He is my best friend and we also collaborate on projects at work frequently and make a great team. I honestly cannot imagine a world where he is not in my life in some way. We have been together for five years, with many periods of long-distance due to our work lives. \n\nHowever, since turning 30, for the past six months, I feel like instead of being engaged in a loving relationship I grow more and more restless. Everyday I carry out the actions that I know are the actions of a loving girlfriend. Everyday I continue to work on a custom made hand sewn quilt for him. But everyday the voice in my head telling me that this isn't it grows stronger and stronger. I often feel like I am battling an inner demon that just wants to ruin things in my life for no good reason. \n\nI do have reasons to doubt my relationship but these are all issues we're working on and regularly discuss. To provide an overview of it all these include :\n\ni) **marriage & family**: when will we get married? I wanted to be engaged as of 2 years ago but he still does not want to. Will we have children? I am indifferent leaning towards no but imaging raising children with him makes it a hard no on my end - I am not interested in parenting a family with this man.\n\n ii) **location** : where will we live? we have not yet settled in one location and are regularly bouncing around between multiple locations. He is happy with this nomadic lifestyle but I want to be settled down in a more permanent position within the next 2 years. \n\niii) **my social life**: despite not wanting to admit it, he gets jealous. he does not like when I am alone with men, or even more generally when I engage in friendly conversation with men as he sees this as a potential threat. While he says he trusts me, it's hard to feel that way when it feels more like he thinks I am going to suck on the penis of every man I pass. \n\nIn addition to these topics that we discuss, I have deeper darker topics which I have spent a lot of time reflecting on for over a year now. These are topics for things I know he would not agree with but are things that the more I reflect on, the more I want to experience. Without going into too much detail, they include sexual acts (e.g., MMF group sex - he is not interested in this and it is something I have brought up as a \"what if\" scenario before), newly developed fetishes (ones that he does not find interest in participating in with me), recreational drug use\/alcohol use (I have never tried weed. it's legal where we are and I am starting to want to at least experience this. the same goes for alcohol - he is completely sober and does not enjoy the idea of me being intoxicated). \n\nIs it normal to reach an age or point in a relationship where you just start to doubt everything? He is my first healthy relationship (and even with that there are red flags due to his jealousy and occasional controlling behaviour) and has helped me to build so much self-confidence that I finally feel happy and non-dependent on anyone (including him). However, due to being in multiple highly abusive relationships before him in my late teens\/early twenties, and generally having an unhealthy relationship with sex, until very recently, I just feel like that part of me is missing that I need to explore. \n\nDespite feeling this way, I still can't help but to continue on the actions of being with him. I love him. But I just don't know if I \\_love\\_ him in a way that a romantic partner should due to their doubting thoughts and dissatisfaction I have for the aspects of my life (e.g., fetishes, drug\/alcohol use) that he currently has more control over. Am I being immature for thinking that there are things I deserve to experience? If my feelings are valid, how can I communicate this all to him without blowing everything up entirely? I cannot stress enough how much I love and care for this man but at the same time I feel like I am on the verge of having a mental breakdown myself as I feel like I am just carrying out a check list of actions that are expected of me as his partner and that don't actually reflect what I want to currently experience in my life.\n\nTLDR: I love my partner more than anything in the world and he is my best friend.

I moved out and took the kids with me but we did agree on 50\/50 custody of the kids, while he kept our house and I moved back in with my parents. For 3 months, we stayed talking, stayed having sex and I would always ask him for us to get back together, but each time he refused. We never talked about getting back together in the future, so it was a break up. In December, I went on my first date and yes, me and the guy ended up having sex. It wasn't anything meaningful, just sex, but I broke it off in mid-January. The entire time I missed my ex, but I will be honest, it felt good to be desired by someone. At the same time, it felt wrong because I missed my ex a lot and knew I still wanted to be with him. My ex did find out about this other guy because he went looking through my phone one day as we were exchanging the kids. He was hurt and upset and did not understand how I could be having sex with someone else while telling him all the while that I wanted to be with him. I explained to him that it was just physical, nothing more, and it made me realize that I do want to stay with him and fight for our relationship. Prior to this, we never had infidelity issues, we were always faithful to each other, we did have money problems, and I do suffer from depression, anxiety, and overall lack of motivation, which did affect our relationship. He is a great provider and father, and I do believe he did his best to support me when I was down. He has 2 other children on top of the 2 we share, so our home was always busy with kids, us working, me going to school, and just overall life. I will say we did argue a lot during our relationship, looking back at it, it was over trivial things, and yes, I do acknowledge that they were probably most of my fault. I continue to tell him that I love him, and that I want to be with him more than anything. I have confided in some of my friends and even my therapist, and they have all said he should not be upset since we were not together in a relationship and it does not count as cheating, and that since we were broken up, what I do is really not his business. My friends have advised me to give him time and space. I am just not really sure on what to do or what to think. Yes, I think deep down, since we were not together he should not be upset by it but I can see why he is. He says he cannot forgive me and me having slept with someone else is a dealbreaker for us getting back together. I really do love him, and really do want to be with him for the rest of my life, and I have begged him almost every day that I am sorry, that I made a mistake, and I will do everything I can to fix us and makeup for what I have done.

We are both currently not financially independent. Our relationship first started on one of the dating apps. I am from the UK but I changed settings to place myself in Spain, as I was planning to move there shortly at the time. He is from Cuba and so he must\u2019ve done the same. He popped up in my dm\u2019s and first started speaking to me in English, but then we moved to Spanish (which I do not speak and use a translator for) because his English is not good. We get on well, many cute and funny times, sending photos of each other, what where we live looks like, family pictures, many compliments, speaking not on FaceTime or phone calls, but through voice notes trying to teach each other words in our respective languages which was cute and funny. One day the mention of how we would meet came up, and as we don\u2019t have jobs yet, the plan was in a couple of months when we had enough money we would sort that out. No definite plan though. One day he told me his father is extremely homophobic, and so we both agreed that he shouldn\u2019t tell his father about us as there was a strong risk of him being kicked out or something worse. He said he thought his mother would be more chilled though. Days ago, after ending our last conversation with kisses, he texted me telling me that he had told his father, that it went horribly, and that now he is going to \u201cbe straight\u201d and \u201cleave the bi thing behind. I\u2019m very sorry\u201d. He then blocked me on WhatsApp. The day after, unexpectedly, he send me a text saying \u201cHow are we going to meet, I still have much affection for you\u201d and he replied about 20 mins later with \u201cFor now, we can be great friends\u201d. He blocks me again after those messages.

This concert is just a minor example of a series of situations that have come up decently in our time together so far that follow the same kind of pattern \n\nI don\u2019t want my triggers to cause me to get upset and lash out. like I know rationally my lack of money is no one else\u2019s problem and I am looking for a new position asap but for the moment, I just feel lost on how to navigate all these feelings!\n\nTL;dr: income gap between my boyfriend and I makes me feel sad I can\u2019t go to events with him or do as many things because I\u2019m always so broke. I\u2019m working on trying to find a new job but would love some insight on how to deal with trigger feelings when it comes to money","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678409250.0},{"title":"I (18m) made a dumb mistake and don\u2019t want to lose my girlfriend.","author":"Icy_Information_2759","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11n9334\/i_18m_made_a_dumb_mistake_and_dont_want_to_lose\/","text":"1 (18M) have a girlfriend (18F) of 3 months and recently went over to another girls house that I had a history of being on and off with after she\nmessaged me out the blue wanting to catch up and beforehand I made it explicitly clear that I had a girlfriend and did not like her in that way.\n\nSo I figured since she knew that I had a\ngirlfriend and that we were just friends, there was no harm in watching a movie so we watched a movie and cuddled which I didn't think was that big of a deal at that particular moment as it meant nothing to me and she had\nsaid that \"friends\" can cuddle.\n\nA day after this happened, I started to feel extremely guilty and anytime my girlfriend messaged me I would be reminded of what had happened. \n\nIt's eating me alive and I don't know what to do, considering my girlfriends mental health and current situation she's exclaimed that I am very important to her in her life so if I was to tell her, I feel as if she'd never trust me again and that she'd leave me which I really don't want to happen cus this girl means so much to me, I understand that being 18 means that to some I am naive and young so I don't really know anything or what i'm talking about but I know how I feel about this girl. \n\nAnd also I was her first and I don't want her to misunderstand how she should be treated by guys or leave a stain on her image of guys and what they're like cause of some dumb shit I did.\nWhat should i do?\n\nTLDR: Went to another girls house and cuddled with her, regretted it and now feel guilty but don\u2019t know what to do and want to stay with girlfriend.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678408011.0},{"title":"My boyfriend (23m) doesn't want to move out with me (25f) after 5 years","author":"LowResource8061","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11n8ujs\/my_boyfriend_23m_doesnt_want_to_move_out_with_me\/","text":"We have been together for 3 years and we have been long distance on and off for about 1 1\/2. He will be finishing school in 6 months. \n\nOver the last few years I've floated the idea of moving out together and he always said he was afraid of sharing finances. I was fine with this because he is in school and being younger at the time I assumed that he'd come around to the idea. I also live with a roommate so I wasn't in a rush.\n\nA few months ago, we discussed moving out seriously and he was on board. The unanimous plan was 1 year after he graduates to give him time to save up and for us to find a place. \n\nRecently he shared with me that he doesn't want to go through with the plan because it's scary and it will complicate our relationship and that he doesn't know what he wants and he was unclear when I asked him to explain. He also mentioned that he never did the math on how long we'd be together at this point.\n\nI feel confused because he always expresses how much he loves me and we stay at eachothers apartments for weeks at a time when we visit each other.\n\nI am at a loss because the timeline puts us at 5 years together and being afraid to complicate the relationship when we've been together for that long is kind of ridiculous. I don't know how to approach this conversation in a way that isn't relationship ending because I still hold out hope that he'll come around once he's out of school. I want to be together but I feel like I'm putting everything on hold in hopes that he'll change his mind. I can't really see myself with anyone else and it feels insensitive for me to feel the way I do.\n\nTldr; boyfriend doesn't want to move out for fear of complicating our 5 year relationship. I'm confused.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678407429.0},{"title":"I hate my sister.

Sorry if i skip around, i\u2019m trying to provide as much information as possible.\n\n   I have 2 half siblings, A 13 year old sister and 6 year old brother. This is about the 13 year old. My mother claims we were close growing up but as i grew older i do not like her at all. I know that sounds bad but i seriously cant see myself having a relationship with her. This is mainly because she\u2019s a pathological liar, a thief and some other things i know i shouldn\u2019t say about my \u201csister\u201d.\n\n  She always stills my clothes, jewelry, etc. And then lies about it when confronted. I told my mother, she\u2019ll have a talk with her and then she would end up doing it again. And it\u2019s unfortunately starting to make me hate her really bad. I\u2019ve had talks with her and she doesn\u2019t seem to care. It\u2019s gotten to the point where i have to hide all of my things (we share a room). I\u2019m not at all innocent, i\u2019ve said some horrible things to get out of frustration which i know is wrong but i cannot stand her anymore. and i would rather not have a relationship with her.\n\nSo how do i go about this, how do i make her stop and understand? Leave any questions and i\u2019ll answer. Thank you.\n\nTLDR: Sister keeps taking my things. and i am 100% sure i hate her and feel nothing towards her.

Things seem good, we never argue, we have multiple vacations planned this year, and things are just generally healthy.\n\nHowever, my girlfriend is also very independent. She's a self-confessed non-clingy person. And this coupled with the fact we're long distance makes me either worry she's not that into me, or that something is wrong with our relationship.\n\nNearly every other long distance couple I see online seems to text throughout the day, everyday. Seems to call for hours most days, seems to be full of love and affection. Mine and my girlfriend's relationship isn't like that.\n\nWe check in at some point during the day to set up a call later that night or to say one of us is busy. We then call for anywhere from one to five hours when we do call. Most of it is just chilling watching TV or playing games but it is nice. We don't really do any real chitchat over text. She also doesn't mind if we're too busy to call for a few days.\n\nTake this week. She's had to go to another city for 2 days, go to sleep early the day before, and travel for a day too. I said that it's a shame if we can't call but it is what it is. I also said I'd be free for an hour to call before she left so it was understandable if we couldn't call. She then said it's fine since it'll only be 4-5 days apart and that we don't need to call everyday. In the days she's been away she's dropped in with messages. On the first day she sent a pic of her car journey, then we had a few messages. The second day she showed me a video of where she's saying followed by a couple of messages, and then we've just had a couple of casual conversations the last couple of days.\n\nWhile this is healthy of her and her general mindset is healthy and logical, I do also feel insecurities about our relationship because of how little it feels like she needs to talk to me. I know she loves me, but the healthy time apart is something I need to adjust to mentally. She's also much less expressive of her missing me than she was in the first few months. Before, we'd go a day or two without calling and she'd say she missed now. Since we met for the first time in person four months ago she's been less expressionate of this type of affectionate. Is any of this anything to worry about?\n\n**TL;DR: long distance girlfriend isn't clingy and fine with not talking for days sometimes. Makes me question if there's anything missing.

I feel very hurt by it.","author":"ArtemisTheirin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/11nmgh4\/i_24f_just_found_pictures_of_my_boyfriend_30m_and\/","text":"Me (24F) and my bf (30M) have been together for 2 years now. We love, trust and care for each other and he says he has never been happier, which I believe. We are planning a future together as well, and are very committed.\n\nToday I found an old USB that I didn\\`t even realize was his, until I put it in the computer. I looked because I thought it was mine and I wanted to use it, so I checked what was on it and I found a bunch of folders with images from his past. Some were family, some were vacations etc, but in a lot of them were images of him and his ex (exes?, I think there was more than one ex - but I didn\u02d9t even look further, because I cound\u00b4t stand looking at him with another woman). I have never seen these, nor did I want to see them, and seeing him in photos with other women in loving\/erotic poses and such, really hurt me.\n\nI don\\`t know why he still has them, he probably forgot they were on the USB, but it still hurt me a lot. I am a jealous person - but not in a way where I wouldn\u00b4t let him be around women or anything, to be clear - I get very jealous and hurt when I see his past, which is already behind him. I think he should\u02d9ve deleted those when they broke up, otherwise I don\u00b4t know why he would\u02d9ve kept them, let alone kept them on an USB that I could\u00b4ve mistakenly looked at, like I did today. It could be an honest mistake, forgetting they were there, but still... It hurt me!\n\nHe isn\u00b4t at home now, he comes back in 2 days and I plan on confronting him. I love him dearly, but I will not stand for this. I will ask why he has them still and tell him to delete the images without hesitation, or I am done. We are planning a future together and if he doesn\u00b4t delete these - delete his past, I can\u00b4t trust that we can move forward. The past is the past for a reason. He should not have those photos, especially if he plans on marrying me.\n\nAm I overreacting or am I right in thinking those should\u00b4ve been deleted a long time ago. What should I do?\n\nEdit: Some images were actual nudes, just to be clear what I meant when I said erotic.\n\nTL;DR - Today I found photos of my boyfriend and his ex on an old USB drive and got very hurt by seeing the images.","upvote_ratio":0.28,"created_utc":1678447313.0}]
