I do apologise in advance for any mistakes I may have made.\nFrom a young age I learned two languages and a dialect simultaneously (Cantonese, English and Hakka) since my parents are from Hong Kong . As I got older I picked up some Mandarin from some friends and family.Obviously I saw a connection between the languages(not English )but never thought much about it.\nAny ways I started learning Japanese a year ago and saw similarities between the Eastern Asian languages(I knew about kanji being borrowed from Chinese Hanzi before learning Japanese). I also noticed that  a lot of the Onomi sounds of the kanji was really close to the Chinese sounding because Onomi is the Chinese sounding of the character when it was introduced into the Japanese language at that time.\nAsking a friend who spoke Mandarin and Japanese fluently she said a lot of the words do not sound alike.Taking a Cantonese approach to the Onomi sounds showed that they sound alike.(Mandarin was not the main language back then so a lot of ancient text should be approached with Cantonese(I was told by a Chinese teacher)).\nIs it possible in any way that at one point both the Chinese and Japanese spoke a language that was similar to one another as Japanese also had influences on the Chinese language,unlike today in which the language aside from Hanzi and kanji are completely different and even they have some differences.\nThank you for taking your time to read this.",

        "text": "Currently trying to wrap my head around both hierarchical and non-hierarchical societies, unfortunately, I come from a completely different field. \n\nThis is a thought I had just now, and I am currently still rolling it around in my head. In general, I am currently playing around in my head with how one could perhaps apply the idea of a Focault-ish \"épistème\" to societies without written records, and how certain structures of knowledge could interact with social orders. E.g. in my thought here, I would think of the knowledge of domestication, husbandry and especially breeding as something that could act as an epistemological indicator, that then also begins to structure the social order of a society (e.g. uncovering ideas like purity of blood, higher value of [human] life that can be consciously constructed, etc.)",

I have done a few undergrad anthropology courses previously, and I've maintained my interest over the years by reading ethnographies and interesting journal articles. At the moment I'm interested in gay men's sexual health, particularly the impact on sexual practices brought about by technologies, the most current example of which would be PrEP (Pre Exposure Prophylaxis). I've worked with this community for the past couple of years so I think I have some pretty solid groundwork for an ethnographic study. \n\nThere seems to be only one program that really suits in Australia, the master of culture, health and medicine at ANU, which has a good reputation for anthropology. Another option would be to pursue a similar degree overseas.\n\nSo, my questions are: Does anyone know about this program at ANU, or similar programs overseas? Is it common for nurses to get into medical anthropology? Does anyone here research sexual health or know of any anthropological research in this field? Just tell me about medical anthropology!",

He purchased it from an antique store in Maryland. He told the shop owner that his girlfriend liked archaeology, and asked him if he had anything I might like. The man pulled this out from behind the counter and said he'd never taken it out for anyone before. He said he wasn't sure of its history, but that it may be a stamp from South or Central America. It seems to be made of stone and I don't think there's any metal in it. Does anyone have any ideas? I've been looking into appraisers in my area because I'd really like to know what this is and learn more about it, but I can't find anyone around here who specializes in ancient items. \n\nThe boyfriend paid $75 for this.

Magic was quickly delegitimized and treated as a fraud. Communication with the supernatural, outside of the religion, was viewed skeptically. Medicine (even before the modern medical system) was becoming less and less of a spiritual job.\n\nThen I read tons of stories about ancient societies all over the world. They always distinguish between these roles -- witches/magicians/sorcerers vs priests vs diviners/oracles vs shaman/medicinemen/healers. They often occupy different characters within the same story (a priest told him not to go against the gods, but the diviner showed him a vision, so he went to a witch who cast a powerful spell). This is in both mythic and historic storytelling. \n\nAnd then when I try to find literature explaining how these practitioners work separately/together within a society, there's usually just a hand wave of \"that's just one person\". I'm sure that's true in many many small and simple ancient tribes, but I feel like these different roles come up way too often to ignore.\n\nAnyone have any articles or expertise to help explain this?",

But, since the Greeks are also alleged to have no capability to have made the journey themselves, by what means did they end up getting that knowledge, even if it's by a tenth-hand source?\n\nCould it have been the Bronze Age Norwegians? Could it have been Native Americans who somehow discovered Europe or made contact with Europeans at a midway point of sorts? If the Greeks didn't have vessels capable of making the journey or partial journey, who did? And how would this knowledge have ultimately made its way to the Greeks?\n\nInterestingly, there's an alleged find of a Roman shipwreck on Oak Island off the coast of Canada I discovered when researching this.\n\nhttp://www.express.co.uk/news/history/628827/ANCIENT-ROMANS-America-eerie-discovery-change-history\n\nIt sounds crazy, but it doesn't appear to have been debunked in a conclusive, public fashion that shows up in top-level Google results.
