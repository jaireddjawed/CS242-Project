[{"title":"Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!","author":"longonbtc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11nthi2\/bitcoin_newcomers_faq_please_read\/","text":"#Welcome to the \/r\/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ\n\nYou've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  \n\nIt all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles\/books\/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:\n\n* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https:\/\/medium.com\/@vijayboyapati\/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)\n* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central\/dp\/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](https:\/\/www.z-epub.com\/book\/1712)\n* [Video 1: The Stories We Tell About Money - Andreas Antonopoulos](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ONvg9SbauMg)\n* [Video 2: The Bitcoin Standard - Saifdean Ammous](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zbm772vF-5M&t=286s) \n* [Video 3: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)\n* [Video 4: But How Does Bitcoin Actually Work](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)\n\nSome other great resources include Michael Saylor's [Hope.com](https:\/\/hope.com\/) and [\"Bitcoin for Everybody\"'](https:\/\/learn.saylor.org\/course\/view.php?id=468) course, Jameson Lopp's [resource page](http:\/\/lopp.net\/bitcoin.html), Gigi's [resource page](https:\/\/bitcoin-resources.com\/#bitcoin-non-technical), and James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s).  Some excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/mempool\/).  \n\nIf you are technically or academically inclined check out [developer resources](https:\/\/developer.bitcoin.org\/) and peer-reviewed [research papers](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg), course lectures from both [MIT](https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/sloan-school-of-management\/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018\/video-lectures\/) and [Princeton](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/7qynvj\/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from\/) as well as future [protocol improvements](http:\/\/diyhpl.us\/wiki\/transcripts\/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions\/) and [scaling resources](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/56nnd8\/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos\/).  Some Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https:\/\/www.lookintobitcoin.com\/), [here](https:\/\/data.bitcoinity.org\/bitcoin\/hashrate\/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a), [here](https:\/\/bitcoinvisuals.com\/) and [here](https:\/\/bitcoin.clarkmoody.com\/dashboard\/).  MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https:\/\/www.microstrategy.com\/en\/resources\/events\/world-2021\/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.\n\nYou can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https:\/\/99bitcoins.com\/obituary-stats) (LOL) and [what you could have earned](https:\/\/dontbuybitcointheysaid.com\/) if you didn't listen to them!  XD\n\n## Key properties of Bitcoin\n\n* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/10h04a6\/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin\/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https:\/\/bashco.github.io\/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation\/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http:\/\/bitcoinblockhalf.com\/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.\n* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin) yourself.\n* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https:\/\/blockstream.info\/).\n* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https:\/\/getumbrel.com\/).  \n* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operation_Choke_Point).\n* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https:\/\/gendal.me\/2013\/10\/21\/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull\/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.\n* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in\/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https:\/\/bitnodes.earn.com\/).\n* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.\n* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http:\/\/bitcoinsimplified.org\/learn-more\/anonymity\/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. \n* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can\u2019t be [brute forced](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.\n* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Script) based on certain criteria being met\n* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Satoshi_(unit\\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. \n* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/charts\/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. \n* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/trusted-third-parties\/).\n* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat\n* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https:\/\/bitcoinfees.earn.com\/) and [mempool activity](https:\/\/jochen-hoenicke.de\/queue\/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https:\/\/lightning.network\/lightning-network-technical-summary.pdf), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.\n* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).\n* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n## Where can I buy bitcoin?\n\n[Bitcoin.org](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https:\/\/www.buybitcoinworldwide.com\/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.\n\n* [Strike](https:\/\/strike.me\/)\n* [Cash App](https:\/\/cash.app\/)\n* [Swan](https:\/\/www.swanbitcoin.com\/)\n* [River Financial](https:\/\/river.com\/)\n* [Kraken](https:\/\/www.kraken.com\/)\n* [Gemini](https:\/\/gemini.com\/)\n* [Bitstamp](https:\/\/www.bitstamp.net\/)\n* [BitFinex](https:\/\/www.bitfinex.com\/)\n* [Xapo](https:\/\/xapo.com\/)\n* [Cex](https:\/\/cex.io\/)\n* [Bottlepay](https:\/\/bottlepay.com\/)\n* [Relai](https:\/\/relai.app\/)\n* [LibertyX](https:\/\/libertyx.com\/)\n* [CoinCorner](https:\/\/www.coincorner.com\/)\n* [RoboSats](https:\/\/learn.robosats.com\/) (P2P)\n* [Bisq](https:\/\/bisq.network\/) (decentralized & P2P)\n* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https:\/\/github.com\/cointastical\/P2P-Trading-Exchanges\/)\n\nYou can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http:\/\/coinatmradar.com\/). Services such as [CardCoins](https:\/\/www.cardcoins.co\/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https:\/\/www.bitwage.com\/).  \n\n**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https:\/\/cryptowat.ch\/bitstamp\/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. \n\n## Securing your bitcoin\n\nWith Bitcoin you can **\"Be your own bank\"** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **\"Bitcoin banks\"** which will hold your bitcoin for you.\n\n* If you prefer to **\"Be your own bank\"** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https:\/\/www.trezor.io\/), [Ledger](https:\/\/www.ledgerwallet.com\/) or [ColdCard](https:\/\/coldcardwallet.com\/) is recommended.\n\n* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https:\/\/bluewallet.io\/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.\n\n* If you prefer to let third party **\"Bitcoin banks\"** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https:\/\/gemini.com\/) or [Unchained Capital](https:\/\/unchained-capital.com\/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **\"Not your keys, not your coins\"**. This means that if you don't store your coins in a wallet that you control the keys to, then you do not really own your bitcoin as you have to ask permission from the third party in order to move them.  \n\n**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** \n\n2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.\n\n**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called \"SIM swapping\" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.\n\nGoogle Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP\n--------------|--------|------------|--------\n[Android](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N\/A | [Android](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)\n[iOS](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/google-authenticator\/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/authy\/id494168017) | [iOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/otp-auth\/id659877384) | N\/A\n\nPhysical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth \/ Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https:\/\/yubikey.com\/) or [Titan](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.\n\nBoth Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. \n\n\n## Watch out for scams\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r \/ btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **\"Don't trust, verify\"**. \n\n* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.\n* Ignore private messages offering services.\n* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.\n* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.\n* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https:\/\/www.google.com\/](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.\n\n## Common Bitcoin Myths\nOften the same concerns arise about Bitcoin from newcomers.  Questions such as:\n\n* Will quantum computers break Bitcoin?\n* Will governments ban Bitcoin?\n* Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?\n\nAll of these questions have been answered many times by a variety of people.

But what do the crypto bros build? Shit that's exposed to risk in the traditional banking sector, dressed up as cryptocurrency. A bank collapses and several of these projects take a hit. They're not cryptocurrency in the way we talk about it, theyre not decentralized, they're not in any way shape or form a part of a separate, permissionless financial system.\n\nNow let's talk about stablecoins. You hear from lots of people something along these lines: cryptocurrency is unstable and volatile, for adoption we need something with a stable value. The usual bitcoiner (and some others) is usually that you're not insulated from debasement risk by the central bank that controls the fiat these stable coins are pegged to or backed by. But that's not really the only or even the worst risk of these types of things.\n\nThere's asymmetric, downside only risk to holding these things. Imagine you've got a stablecoin worth a dollar each, and the peg breaks, it becomes worth $1.10. What are you likely to do? You're likely to sell it to make some free money, wait for the price to go back to a dollar and buy back for a free 10% profit. This puts downward price pressure on the stablecoin and helps keep the peg. Sounds good.\n\nNow, the reverse. You have a stablecoin worth a dollar and the peg breaks and it's worth $0.90. What are you likely to do? Stablecoins breaking peg are big hits to their perceived value, *you're likely to sell what you have at a 10% loss to avoid losing more money.* some enterprising people might buy thinking the peg will be restored, but for the most part there's likely to be downward price pressure due to such a depeg.\n\n*In both circumstances a sell off is likely.* This means there is always more downside risk than upside to holding stablecoins. The risk profile is asymmetrical.\n\nIs this the stability that is going to bring adoption? Continued exposure to traditional finance systems, a cap on any upside on your savings, a guarantee that one day the peg will break downwards, and of course, exposure to debasement?\n\nStablecoins, particularly those backed by fiat, are a worse place to store your money, even with high volatility. They're not the magic bullet. They're generally a bad idea.\n\nThe only \"stablecoins\" that make any sense would be coins backed by commodities like gold, in a vault, audited and proven periodically. But those aren't really stablecoins, those are tokenized commodities. They can reduce your exposure to this market and still have symmetrical risk profiles.\n\nAnother type would be algorithmic ones *not collateralized with anything inside a bank*. DAI fucked up when they allowed USDC to be used as collateral, they ceased being purely algorithmic backed by collateral.and became partly backed by bank reserves, thus exposing them to the banking system. Even without that they're still exposed to debasement risk but at least that's a known risk they're choosing. People didn't buy DAI to basically have their dollars in a bank uninsured. Ideally a token like this would be pegged to a commodity to avoid that risk, and not a fiat currency.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678569695.0},{"title":"Personally affected by the SVB collapse..","author":"TheHodlingHermit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11onz50\/personally_affected_by_the_svb_collapse\/","text":"We just witnessed the second largest bank collapse in US history, and most shareholders lost everything. I work at a Biotherapeutics startup where we are creating therapies to cure cancers with natural killer cells. My first one-on-one meeting with our CEO, we actually had a small argument over Bitcoin. He said it was like the old tulip bubble, I explained why that perception was completely wrong and said I actually don't trust the banking system. Our company's investments are held in this very bank, and we received an email regarding this.\n\nMore banks will suffer from the Fed's overreaching via quantitative tightening from the mass inflation caused by their own printing of trillions of fiat from thin air. The US debt ceiling has to be perpetually raised, and the dollar will perpetually be debased. When the banking system fails more, the government will pivot from raising interest rates and begin to cut rates and print more fiat to bail out the banks. Never ending cycle that inevitably makes fiat lose value. We've witnessed the bank runs in Greece, the hyperinflation in Turkey, Venezuela, etc. Jerome Powell and the Fed are intentionally creating economic slowdown that will bring recession and will print more money to keep the scheme going as a bandaid every time, its how our antiquated money system is set up, and the majority of our generations will suffer. \n\nSimply holding cash means losing roughly 8-10 percent of its purchasing power each year. Fiat has infinite supply and is meant to debase into nothing, as it is backed by nothing. To quantify it, US banks have 17.6 trillion in deposits, only 3.1 trillion is backed by cash, with only 100 billion is backed by physical cash.

Despite the volatility, I'm still holding onto my Bitcoin, and here's why:\n\nBitcoin is more than just a cryptocurrency - it's a game-changer. It's a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that allows for direct transactions without the need for a middleman. This empowers people to take control of their money, reduces fees, and speeds up transactions.\n\nBut Bitcoin's potential goes way beyond payments. It's a revolutionary technology that's scarce, with only 21 million coins ever to be created. This makes it a store of value like gold. Bitcoin is also decentralized, meaning that it's not controlled by any single person or entity. This makes it resistant to censorship and control by governments or corporations.\n\nWith Bitcoin, anyone can contribute to its development and improve the code because it's open-source. And in the future, it has the potential to become a global currency that's accepted by businesses worldwide. While we're not there yet, I believe that Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the traditional financial system and create a more equitable and transparent global economy.\n\nAbove all, I think there\u2019s a new factor that\u2019s recently gained traction within the space: artificial intelligence. ChatGPT and other AI models have serious potential to impact the crypto industry in several ways:\n\n-Analysis and Predictive Capabilities: AI models like ChatGPT can be trained on vast amounts of data and can help to identify trends and patterns in the crypto market. This analysis can help traders and investors to make more informed decisions and can potentially improve their profitability.\n\n-Trading Algorithms: AI models can be used to develop trading algorithms that can execute trades automatically based on market conditions and user-defined rules. These algorithms can be faster and more efficient than human traders, and can potentially lead to more profitable trades.\n\n-Fraud Detection: Cryptocurrencies have faced issues with fraud and hacking. AI models can be used to detect fraud and prevent unauthorized access to cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. This can help to improve the security of the crypto industry and enhance user trust.\n\n-Customer Support: As the crypto industry grows, so does the need for customer support. Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI models can help to provide 24\/7 customer support, answering questions and resolving issues in real-time.\n\n-Blockchain Analytics: AI models can be used to analyze blockchain data, identify potential security threats, and track suspicious transactions. This can help to prevent fraud and improve the overall security of the blockchain.\n\nOverall, the impact of AI on the crypto industry is still in its early stages, but there is significant potential for AI to enhance the security, efficiency, and profitability of the crypto market.\n\nSure, Bitcoin has risks. The price can fluctuate wildly, and there are security concerns. But I believe that the potential for Bitcoin to change the world is too great to ignore. I'm staying invested because I want to be a part of that change. Bitcoin is the future, and I'm excited to see what it holds.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678576848.0},{"title":"Perhaps time to start\u2026","author":"cookmanager","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/024owhayu7na1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678568835.0},{"title":"USDC & DAI DEPEG?

So new bitcoins have to be created or otherwise it would be hard for bitcoin to function and expand as there wouldn't be enough or any bitcoins to use, especially when new bitcoin users would need bitcoins as well. This leaves me with the following questions which you more experienced bitcoin people probably have easy answers to.\n\nWhere does this number 900 new bitcoins created per day come from? Why isn't it 3200 new bitcoins created per day or 14 new bitcoins created every 10 minutes instead of 6,25 bitcoins created every 10 minutes?\n\nWho is the person or who are the people who decide these numbers? Who are we trusting here? What if these people\/person decide to change the numbers suddenly for what ever reason?

Over the years you and your family will gain more and more bitcoin because everyone needs what you make but everyone else will have less and less bitcoin to use to buy what is necessary to survive.\n\nHow can bitcoin be the future of money in such a scenario?\n\nTo me it sounds impossible because noone would want such a future. If bitcoin would be the future of money that would mean we would have a very dystopian looking future where most of humans are slaves and some are like gods. And the population would dwindle until there would be not many left because of the unlimited greed of some people. Yes or no?\n\nIt just struck me but currency like this is the cause of every large empire where there were emperors or kings etc. Money can buy power, and with power you can get more money. And if there would be such a thing as an absolute money you would be able to get absolute power.\n\nDo you want such a future?","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678556749.0},{"title":"Fiat bank users with more than 12 BTC just lose the rest if the bank goes bankrupt.

The news has shaken the heart of the tech ecosystem and has generated uncertainty among investors and entrepreneurs who rely on the bank to finance their projects.\n\nSVB is one of the main banks in Silicon Valley and has been essential in financing the growth of numerous startups in the area. However, the global financial crisis has negatively impacted its investments and has led to a series of financial problems that ultimately resulted in the bank's collapse.\n\nThe collapse of SVB has generated a domino effect in the Silicon Valley economy. Many startups that rely on the bank to finance their projects have been affected, as they now face a lack of capital and the closure of credit lines. Additionally, investors have lost confidence in the market, leading to a decrease in venture capital investment in the region.\n\nBanking panic has quickly spread among investors and entrepreneurs, who fear that the collapse of SVB is just the tip of the iceberg of a broader financial crisis. Many are wondering if other Silicon Valley banks are also at risk and if the region's economy is in danger of collapsing.\n\nAmidst this climate of uncertainty, financial authorities have tried to reassure the public and have taken measures to protect bank customers. However, many investors and entrepreneurs remain concerned about the future of their businesses and the financial health of the Silicon Valley ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIn this context, it is important to remember that Silicon Valley has overcome financial crises in the past and has demonstrated great resilience. The region has a unique entrepreneurial culture and a strong community of entrepreneurs and investors who have been able to adapt to market changes and overcome obstacles.\n\nAlthough the collapse of SVB has been a blow to the Silicon Valley economy, it can also be an opportunity to reflect on the excessive dependence on traditional banks in financing startups. In the future, new forms of financing may be sought, such as crowdfunding or cryptocurrencies, which allow entrepreneurs and investors to diversify their investment options and reduce their dependence on banks.\n\nIn summary, the banking panic in Silicon Valley following the collapse of SVB is understandable, but it is also important to remain calm and remember the region's ability to overcome financial crises. It is likely that the Silicon Valley economy will adapt to market changes and find new ways of financing to drive the growth of startups.","upvote_ratio":0.54,"created_utc":1678486044.0},{"title":"I got caught in the BlockFi fiasco!","author":"Boring-Bus-3743","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11obeph\/i_got_caught_in_the_blockfi_fiasco\/","text":"I moved my BTC to my BlockFi wallet after my seed phrase was compromised during a move.

Per the BoC's communications - [COVID QE response communication)](https:\/\/www.bankofcanada.ca\/2020\/08\/our-covid-19-response-large-scale-asset-purchases\/):\n\n>Our economy depends on credit. When the financial system is working, households and businesses have access to credit. For example, people might take out a mortgage to buy a house or use a line of credit to pay for their child\u2019s braces. And companies may need money to expand and create jobs, so they might borrow from investors through financial markets.\n\nThis is also true of USD globally. It's mostly credit. \n\nSo, when the Fed issues \"reserves\" as part of QE, it's often labelled as \"money printing\", but when Canada issues \"reserves\" under a QE program? Well: \n\n>How are we paying for these assets(QE)? **There is a common misconception that we are just printing money, but this isn\u2019t the case.** We pay for these purchases with settlement balances (reserves). In effect, settlement balances act like loans from financial institutions to us. When we buy assets, we borrow from financial institutions by crediting them with a deposit of settlement balances in the accounts they have at the Bank of Canada. \n\nCanada is clear that their reserve issuance isn't money printing. What actually takes place, is that commercial banks\/primary dealers buy the assets *first* (sometimes utilizing pre-existing \"settlement balances\", but mostly via wholesale market funding).\n\nThis wholesale market is broadly dollar based (USD) and is often called the eurodollar or shadow banking system... in reality, it's just a network of interconnected global banks and bank-like institutions. \n\nCanadian dollar supply relies on the ability of Canadian banks to obtain funding via exchange, swaps, repo, etc.. and importantly; collateral. Collateral is required for most of these activities. This global funding market is one of the primary sources of balance sheet expansion (for all global banks). \n\nCanada is inextricably tied to this global US dollar funding system, where USD denominated collateral is king. We have a close relationship and active trade with the US, but we are greatly at risk of an inability to generate\/obtain\/participate in dollar funding. As per the BIS, the [implications for financial stability are hard to assess](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11fab9r\/a_note_on_banks_and_swaps\/)... and indeed they are, as Canada (and the world) will be more and more sensitive to currency and maturity mismatches, and collateral shortages going forward. \n\nAlright.. and now a geopolitical opinion (I'm just a banker, so grain of salt):\n\nCanada will likely be the first G7 country to implode via an inability to participate in dollar funding markets (although this may take a while). Our implosion is less likely to occur via Canadian government\/household debt levels than it is due to constraints imposed by collateral shortages at the wholesale level (we'll pop before anyone else in the G7.... However, we are also more likely to see further sovereignty erasure, and greater vassal-ification by the US or other entities abroad... before anything resembling a total default).","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678328369.0},{"title":"BitBox stacking directly to your hardware wallet KYC free?","author":"21_mil_btc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11my82w\/bitbox_stacking_directly_to_your_hardware_wallet\/","text":"See https:\/\/shiftcrypto.ch\/blog\/bitbox-03-2023-trift-update\/.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is KYC free for less than 950\u20ac\/day.

Let's look at how $100 invested in bitcoin at the time of the halvings increased in the months following those halvings.\n\nAfter 10-17 months, this $100 had increased to $9,600 (halving of 2012), $2,200 (halving of 2016) and $600 (halving of 2020). After reaching these high values, the price of bitcoin lost more than 70% in the months thereafter.\n\nA simplified analogy helps to understand what happens after halving. Consider a city with a growing population in which, say, 1,000 new flats are built each month. If 1,000 new people arrive in the city each month, the price of flats remains stable: everything that comes onto the market finds a buyer.\n\nIf, in 2020, a law suddenly limited the construction of new flats to 500 from one month to the next and 1,000 people continued to arrive each month, the price of flats would undoubtedly rise, because 500 new arrivals would be without housing. Perhaps existing owners would start selling their flats, thereby pocketing healthy profits (and informing their neighbors about it). And the more prices rise, the more recent and old owners will be willing to sell their flats (and the more new people will be willing to buy and hope to profit from the rise). Until no one is willing to pay the by now unrealistic prices and the bubble bursts. It seems possible to me (but of course way from certain) that the bitcoin price will follow a similar trajectory following the next halving of 2024.\n\nAt present, any method used to buy bitcoins carries risks. For this reason, I split my purchases equally between three methods: a cold wallet, a centralized exchange and an ETP holding physical bitcoins. I know the saying \"not your keys, not your coins\" but I also know that probably millions of bitcoins have been lost and certainly some of these losses are due to people no longer having access to their cold wallets. By splitting my purchases into three separate pots, I don't need to predict which one is likely to fail. In the unlikely event that one of them goes to zero, the price of bitcoin \u201conly\u201d needs to gain 50% from the purchasing price for me to recover the initial capital.\n\nI believe in the long-term potential of bitcoin: *The Bitcoin Standard*'s argument that in the long run, the form of currency most difficult to produce will prevail seems plausible to me. But I also think that there will be price bubbles in the future. My (temporary) exit strategy: I plan to sell 70-80% of the money invested in bitcoin 10-15 months after the halving of 2024 when the bubble will likely reach its limit. After the next bubble bursts, I will gradually buy back bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s see in early 2025 if this post has aged like milk or wine.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678368592.0},{"title":"Paul Krugman: Too busy to tweet.

A TL;DR is at the end.\n\nIt is known to everyone that the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as the World Bank, lends money to developing nations. It turns out that the interest these nations pay does not come only in the form of a premium on the amount they borrowed. What are the other determinants? The contract clauses these nations have to sign. We'll get back to these shortly.\n\nThe general aspect of the situation was summed up in a [piece](https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/opinions\/2021\/5\/6\/rich-countries-drained-152tn-from-the-global-south-since-1960) by J. Hickel, visiting scholar at the London School of Economics, and others:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Rich countries have a monopoly on decision-making in the World Bank and IMF, they hold most of the bargaining power in the World Trade Organization, they use their power as creditors to dictate economic  policy in debtor nations, and they control 97 percent of the world\u2019s patents.\n\n# The contracts have conditionality clauses that forbid borrowers from investing in their own development\n\nArgentina has been a huge borrower from the IMF. The crisis they had in 2001 was partially due to their IMF binding clauses: they were told to cut government spending on specific areas, such as health, education and security. The IMF provided another set of loans and measures to enforce this would be paid. Amongst this:\n\n* Argentina was forced to concentrate its economy on exports, therefore preventing the local market to develop industries such as microchip ones, as well as to open its market to the rest of the world. This resulted in a fair amount of local companies closing their doors, as they could not compete with the global market;\n* Being forced to repay the loans and without the possibility to do so, they were forced to take even more loans, undermining their capacity to feed people.\n\nGhana also borrowed many times from the IMF. A period of loans goes between 1983-2006. The austerity measures required by the IMF included cutting funds for the National Health Fund (NHF), which funds the public healthcare service. This was supposedly with the excuse of having its money back. Between 2008 and 2009 alone, the allocation of resources to the NHF fell by **40%** (48% if inflation is taken into account). This caused citizens to be left without proper healthcare service, overworked professionals and lack of material for medical procedures.\n\nAnother conditionality for Ghana's loan was that the government should delay payment to domestic suppliers. In addition to that, no investment projects were performed in 2009 due to the austerity measures. As a very detailed [report](https:\/\/actionaid.org\/sites\/default\/files\/implications_of_imf_loans_and_conditionalities_on_the_poor_and_vulnerable_in_ghana.pdf) on the matter writes:\n\n>\\[...\\] since no new opportunities are opened up by way of award of new contracts as a result of IMF conditionalities, laborers, artisans, food sellers and their households are badly hit \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>GoG increase in electricity tariffs upon advice of the IMF has hit the vulnerable and the poor hardest. For instance, in June 2010, the Public Utility Regulatory Commission (PURC) proposed average increase of 89 percent and 36 per cent in electricity and water tariffs respectively. Therefore, the steep increases in the utility tariffs imply that this was a condition that needed to be met in order for the government to get other tranche of the loan.\n\nThe non-comprehensive list of examples is vast: Greece, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Nigeria, Lebanon, Tunisia, Turkey, Morocco, Jordan. Another [piece](https:\/\/www.africason.com\/2014\/08\/imf-and-world-bank-neo-colonial-tool-to.html) states that\n\n>In Lebanon, debt service accounts for 47 percent of the government's budget. **Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey all spend more on debt service than they do  on education**; all spend twice as much on debt service than they do on  health care.\n\n# Have the aids failed?\n\nTo the countries that borrowed, yes. To the lenders, no. A [scientific paper](https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13563467.2021.1899153) from 2021 quantified the damages of unequal exchanges between the Global South (GS) and the Global North (GN). The TL;DR is\n\n>Over the whole period, drain from the South totaled $62 trillion  (constant 2011 dollars), or **$152 trillion** when accounting for lost  growth.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>**For every dollar of aid the South receives, they lose $14 in drain through unequal exchange alone, not counting other kinds of losses like  illicit financial outflows and profit repatriation**\n\nThese unequal exchanges can be understood with a simple analogy: if the minimum wage in a certain country is 2x less than in e.g. the US, this country needs to spend twice as much to import goods from the US, whereas the US only pays half as much to import the same amount of goods. In addition to that, there's no fair fight when discussing international monetary policies, according to J. Hickel:\n\n>**Rich countries have a monopoly on decision-making in the World Bank and IMF**, they hold most of the bargaining power in the World Trade Organization, they use their power as creditors to dictate economic policy in debtor nations, and they control 97 percent of the world\u2019s patents.\n\nAnother difficult aspect is that **the IMF loans money to the very group of people that put this or that country in economic distress**. From here on, the clauses contribute to a snowball of bad decisions that lead population to suffer and to always be hostage of international policies.\n\n# El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as Legal Tender might help to break the cycle\n\nTo start with, El Salvador only invested around 1% of its Treasury into Bitcoin. It's unlikely they'll face bankruptcy on that or that they will default on their debts, as advertised North and South by traditional media outlets. That being said, the IMF was adamant and made many attacks on El Salvador due to its adoption of Bitcoin as a Legal Tender:\n\n[El Salvador president's bitcoin push casts shadow over IMF efforts](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/el-salvador-presidents-bitcoin-push-casts-shadow-over-imf-efforts-2021-06-07\/)\n\n[World Bank rejects El Salvador request for help on bitcoin implementation](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/el-salvador-keep-dollar-legal-tender-seeks-world-bank-help-with-bitcoin-2021-06-16\/)\n\n[IMF recommends El Salvador not use bitcoin as legal tender](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/markets\/us\/imf-recommends-el-salvador-not-use-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-11-22\/)\n\n[Factbox: IMF asks El Salvador to drop bitcoin, more countries clamp down](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/markets\/currencies\/imf-asks-el-salvador-drop-bitcoin-more-countries-clamp-down-2022-01-26\/)\n\nThere were even outlets spreading out El Salvador would default on their debt:\n\n[The big default? The dozen countries in the danger zone](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/markets\/europe\/big-default-dozen-countries-danger-zone-2022-07-15\/)\n\nWhich, as we know, didn't happen, as they paid their debt in full last month:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/av4rrqoojcma1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a74b15c78db0f3ed49f39300970628ab0688c859\n\nSome time after the payment, the IMF acknowledged that the experiment did not completely fail:\n\n[IMF says El Salvador's bitcoin risks have not materialized but 'should be addressed'](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/finance\/imf-says-el-salvadors-bitcoin-risks-have-not-materialized-should-be-addressed-2023-02-11\/)\n\nIn a recent document, which was reported in detail by a [post](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11a401m\/international_monetary_fund_released_a_paper\/) from another user, the IMF stated that cryptocurrencies should not be used as a Legal Tender, allegedly to \"o safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability\". As discussed yet by other users in the sub, it seems they're simply afraid of other nations following El Salvador's queue. The reasons for that are many, but my main guess is related to the aspects explored in the first part of this post: **if they're not issuing the currency, they don't have control over a nation's monetary policy**.\n\nEl Salvador has not disrupted the system yet and is very far from doing so. The danger, however, is that they created a serious precedent. **For the first time in modern history, rich countries can't control nor can they affect the issuing of a developing country's Legal Tender**. Other countries might follow suit. Since all fiat currencies are somewhat tied to the US Dollar, be it by soft power or actual economic deals, this precedent is a serious disruption of the status quo that is in place since 1971.\n\n# There are flaws in El Salvador's Bitcoin adoption, though\n\nIt was reported by an actual El Salvadoran redditor (I couldn't find the posts) that the system implemented there has flaws:\n\n* There was no educational period for the population to know what it is\n* The control of the wallet's keys are not public, and people don't know who exactly have access to them\n* At the end of the day, some places accept it, others don't, it is not a widespread thing\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* The IMF impoverishes developing nations with austerity clauses that forbid them to actually invest in development\n* El Salvador is far from \"beating the system\" with Bitcoin, but created a dangerous precedent as other nations might follow suit\n* **It's the first time in modern history that the IMF and its affiliates can't control nor can they affect the issuing of a country's Legal Tender.** This might give developing nations more power to break the IMF-dependent loan cycle in the future.\n\nI do want to see the next chapters.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678207754.0},{"title":"Staking bitcoin","author":"5tatutoryApe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11mpbq5\/staking_bitcoin\/","text":"Hi all, I'm not new to BTC but new to staying (never done this before) so seeking some advice. \n\nI currently have my coins on my ledger.

Most of these people are NOT going to be able to use cold wallets and many would probably lose their seed phrase.\n\nWhat are some things being done to help facilitate the widespread adoption by improving the user experience?  I'm sure some possibilities would require some level of trust (e.g. a company storing physical seed backups, insurance, etc.), but I think that might be necessary to see that level of adoption.\n\nI mean, I'm pretty tech savvy, but even I get a little nervous about the possibilities of an unfortunate series of evens leading to loss of funds.\n\nI see Bitcoin as the people taking control of their currency, which is heavily needed, but I'm not convinced most people are sufficiently competent enough or comfortable with the current requirements to security the funds.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678237508.0},{"title":"once the lightning network gains critical mass it will become the strongest network effect we have ever seen.","author":"slvbtc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11kuhd9\/once_the_lightning_network_gains_critical_mass_it\/","text":"I used to wonder when everyone will start accepting bitcoin, but now I realise they probably wont.  Whats more likely is that the world starts seeing lightning as the one global payments protocol for sending and recieving payments. Lightning infrastructure companies all over the world will start helping existing financial apps and point of sale service providers to integrate with lightning so that any app whether that be cashapp paypal wise or your local payments app and banking apps will be able to send to lightning and recieve from lightning while every point of sale and ecommerce solution will be able to recieve to lightning invoices.\n\nOnce this happens every app in every country will be able to pay any other app in any other country including point of sale devices and ecommerce checkouts and for the first time in human history the worlds financial system will finally be interoperable and easy to use on a global scale.\n\nMost people wont know what bitcoin or lightning is, all they will know is their app can now send to any other app and pay to any merchant on earth online or in person. \n\nThis seems like the logical progression. Maybe in 10 or 20 years everyone will hold their balances in sats too because of fiat currency depreciation but in the near term it is the lightning network that will proliferate around the world and become one of the worlds strongest network effects we have ever seen. Any app or bank or merchant that isnt plugged into lightning will be left behind.\n\nThe cherry on top is that as lightning gains its unstoppable network effects and proliferates around the world anyone with a simple lightning wallet holding some sats will be able to fully integrate into that system being able to send and recieve to any person and any merchant on earth. Thats the ultimate goal. Lightning is the trojan horse that will put bitcoin at the very center of the worlds new financial system.\n\nSo I have stopped asking the question when will merchants accept bitcoin and have started asking the question how long until the existing payments infrastructure plugs into lightning. Network effects are strong and network effects for payments are far stronger than any social network, afterall payments are far more important to people than facebook. So it is highly likely that by 2030 the entire worlds financial apps and point of sale solutions will all be integrated with the lightning network.\n\nCritical mass for the lightning network may start once a handful of banks or point of sale service providers have integrated in 10 or 20 of the largest nations. At that point the network effect of payments will see lightning go mainstream extremely quickly. We have already seen xapo private bank integrate lightning and blackhawk POS service provider in the US integrate lightning. By 2025 we may have reached critical mass escape velocity and between 2025 and 2030 lightning will spread around the world until it is used by absolutely every financial app and point of sale terminal on earth.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678181023.0},{"title":"21 Million Bitcoin or BUST -- Satoshi's Limit Explained","author":"tigers1230","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=93xP2QHX1L0","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.25,"created_utc":1678288547.0},{"title":"Send fiat, the other party receive crypto","author":"tessietessa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11lvt9v\/send_fiat_the_other_party_receive_crypto\/","text":"Do you know of any solutions where you transfer fiat, but the receiver automatically receive in crypto?\n\nFor instance, sender doesn\u2019t know much about crypto but the receiver wants crypto\n\nPls help, thanks!","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678280494.0},{"title":"Max Supply","author":"majorityreal","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11m2mkp\/max_supply\/","text":"If Bitcoin replaced government issued fiat and central banks. \n\nShould ecomomies grow?

Here are some benefits of using a self-directed IRA to hold bitcoin:\n\nTax advantages: With a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, you can enjoy tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals. By using a self-directed IRA to hold bitcoin, you can potentially enjoy the same tax benefits while investing in a rapidly growing asset class.\n\nDiversification: Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and investing in it can help diversify your retirement portfolio. By holding a portion of your retirement assets in bitcoin, you can potentially reduce the overall risk of your portfolio.\n\nControl: Self-directed IRAs allow you to have more control over your retirement assets. You can choose how much bitcoin to invest in, when to buy or sell, and where to store your assets. This level of control can help you make more informed investment decisions.\n\nFlexibility: With a self-directed IRA, you can invest in a variety of assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds, including bitcoin. This flexibility allows you to customize your retirement portfolio to your specific investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nSecurity: By holding bitcoin in a self-directed IRA, you can potentially enjoy greater security than holding it in a personal wallet. Self-directed IRA custodians are regulated by the IRS and must follow strict rules and guidelines to protect your retirement assets.\n\nOf course, investing in bitcoin carries risks, and it's important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. But if you're interested in investing in bitcoin for your retirement, a self-directed IRA could be a powerful tool to help you achieve your financial goals.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678206402.0},{"title":"The currency of the people!","author":"mcrech","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/yh4vlk0cd8ma1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678139169.0},{"title":"Bisq - question about privacy","author":"coski_btc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11l2oao\/bisq_question_about_privacy\/","text":"Hey fellow bitcoiners!\n\nSetup Bisq today to increase privacy for my sat stacking \u2026 anyone know the best payment methods?\n\nLooked at the faster payments option and you need to enter your bank account details, was wondering whether these are shared at all with any intermediaries\/seller?","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678203772.0},{"title":"Lighting, how do I start?","author":"boring--planet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11l9o80\/lighting_how_do_i_start\/","text":"How to I send X BTC to a lighting wallet, how do I create one and what\u2019s a reliable iOS app?

Before the first bull run anyway. \n\nFor the past few weeks I've been studying Bitcoin and made some startling realizations.\n\n1. Holy shit I don't own any bitcoin. I sure hope Binance will accept my IOU. What if they go bankrupt. Holy shit.\n2. I cannot believe anyone accepts this nothing-backed paper money called fiat currency.\n3. How did I not realize what bitcoin was all those years ago, why was I only fixated on price.\n4. Bitcoin, not crypto\n\nI remember this shift in perspective after about a week of reading about bitcoin. Looking around me, the world had changed. It is as if I'm seeing something that the others cannot, even though it's right before their eyes. I now understand this as being orange pilled. After that I haven't been able to stop learning about bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is sound money, can never exceed 21 million, outside of government control, no inflation, no trust. It's an incredible invention\/discovery. \n\nI tell people about bitcoin, yet no one cares. \n\n\"You can own your own money\"\n\n\"It's like buying 1\/21.000.000th of the worlds gold\"\n\nThe response is a polite \"that's interesting\" at best. Mostly people only care about the price (like I did myself), and cannot look past it as an investment in the traditional sense. They don't see the issue with the money today.\n\nThis is somewhat comforting in that I'm still early, even being all these years late. But still lonely. \n\nI feel like the dog that is chained to a stick. It feels completely free right up until it reaches the end of it's allowed space, then the chain tightens. The government is allowing cash to disappear, restricting how much cash you can withdraw, inflating our currency, requiring KYC on the exchanges. and if you want to do something else, if you don't agree, the chain tightens. You play by the rules of the game.\n\nSo now I just got my Trezor in the mail. Moved over a small amount of BTC before factory resetting and recovering and only then moving over the rest of \"my\" BTC. Which Binance was so kind to let me do.\n\nI am now the proud owner of my own bitcoin for the first time. Let me just say what a relief it was seeing the transactions on my wallet with 10 confirmations after waiting for days knowing full well that \"not your keys not your bitcoin\". \n\nFrom here I want to run my own node and set up a lightning wallet in order to pay for things using bitcoin and tip users here on the forum. Also planning for my metal seed backup. Along with how to transition from KYC to non-KYC bitcoin. As a vanity metric I want to reach that 100.000.000 satoshi. Also need a new exchange...\n\nThanks for reading, what a time to be alive.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678143149.0},{"title":"Let's say I found a wallet.db and hash.txt files on a flash drive from 2014.

It will then be obvious to everyone that Bitcoin is a superior digital currency and people will begin to rush to it as a safe haven asset. It will be seen as a form of digital gold or even cash.

Merch will be limited to 21 numbered copies, of course. Our vision is to create an annual, intimate experience bringing Bitcoin to a new Nordic city each year, until hyperbitcoinization is achieved and beyond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Northern Lightning includes some of the great minds in Bitcoin.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p1vcgwfcg5ma1.png?width=1414&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a3071a1ea62dadb8ecc9491dd7533dfd54e14042)\n\nThis first edition will be a three-day Bitcoin conference in a historical setting among the dramatic scenery and wooden harbors of Bergen, headlined by the greatest minds in Bitcoin, with the opportunity to orange pill hundreds of no-coiners at a massive party running on the Lightning Network.\n\nHodlonaut, Knut Svanholm and Peter Todd are just [some of the great Bitcoiners who will be joining](https:\/\/twitter.com\/EuroDale\/status\/1631587272595324928), covering topics like monetary liberation, Bitcoin adoption and Lightning innovation.\n\nFocused on bringing Bitcoiners together and creating deep connections with minimal stage staring, Northern Lightning also wants to provide the purest signal anywhere.

Party goers will have the opportunity to use Lightning when buying drinks, renting towels or buying merch, and even buying bitcoin for cash peer-to-peer when onboarding.\n\nIt\u2019s all designed to offer a little less conversation, a little more Bitcoin action.\n\nAnd as for the venue, [Smien Laksev\u00e5g Verft](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/smienlaxevaag\/) is Bergen\u2019s oldest ship wharf, recently converted into a nightclub opening directly onto the fjord, which will offer free welcome drinks as well as sauna use and an all-night barbecue.\n\n## Not Only For Adults\n\nTalk of raves may not appeal to the more family oriented, but Northern Lightning 2023 has got you and your little ones covered, too.\n\nMy own daughter, [Lykushka (who is nine)](https:\/\/twitter.com\/EuroDale\/status\/1629173626967580674) is organizing the kids\u2019 corner and workshop, a space to educate young minds about Bitcoin while having lots of fun.

One way to push the Bitcoin value proposition forward would be to organize a grassroots bank run across the United States and show that the US dollar is the ultimate shitcoin ponzi. \n\nEssentially we would try to organize a single day where a large swath of people go to the bank and pull out a certain amount of cash. Either that or make it where its a two month long endeavor and everyone withdrawals smaller amounts so that the banks aren't spooked. \n\nThe end goal would be to force the banks to halt the ability for people to withdraw cash for a time and that way normies would finally see that the emperor has no clothes, that the reserves inside a bank are a small fraction of the actual liabilities they owe to customers. \n\nI would love to mirror the grassroots effort of [dontpay.uk](https:\/\/dontpay.uk) with this effort.\n\nI understand that there is risk that this pulls forward the demise of trust in the current banking system (hurting everyday people in the short run) but I think exposing the fraud that is fractional reserve banking to the everyday person is critical and will help fast track Bitcoin adoption as people race to educate themselves on the best bearer monetary asset every created. Its necessary for people to understand the system they currently operate in but don't understand. \n\nRoadmap would be to set up a landing page with info about the bank run once details are solidified. We would want to move the communication about the project to a more secure and private messaging platform. But simply put, circle a date to have a run on the banks and then spread the word quietly through secure channels to as many bitcoiners as possible. \n\nThoughts?","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678119115.0},{"title":"Bitcoin Circulating Supply on Exchanges is Under 12%","author":"escodelrio","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11j42oa\/bitcoin_circulating_supply_on_exchanges_is_under\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cpqu8cb1iyla1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=812ba026185d5719ef71ac81827b1b8d397ce9ba","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678037720.0},{"title":"Mentor Monday, March 06, 2023: Ask all your bitcoin questions!","author":"rBitcoinMod","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/11jrgn3\/mentor_monday_march_06_2023_ask_all_your_bitcoin\/","text":"Ask (and answer!) away!

Most people know roughly how much their currency is worth in US dollars.\n\nAsk an indian how much 81,000 rupee is worth and they will say around $1,000 USD. Ask a brit how much 830 pounds is worth and they will say around $1,000 USD. Ask a singaporean how much 1,350 SGD is worth and they will say around $1,000 USD.\n\nMost people dont know what their currency is worth in other national currencies but most people know what their currency is worth in USD because the US dollar is the worlds reference currency.\n\nBitcoin is still small relative to the USD but it is already becoming more global and more prevalent in most countries, every country has its own bitcoin exchanges. It is also starting to be used more in cross border remittances.\n\nPeople compare their currency to the US dollar in order to measure their currencies performance. But as the US dollars role deminishes and bitcoins role increases people all over the world will start comparing their currency to bitcoin in order to measure their currencies performance.\n\nThere will come a time where bitcoin takes over the role of being the go-to reference currency. Soon more people will know what their currency is worth in bitcoin than know what their currency is worth in US dollars and the goal will not be to maintain stability against the USD but to maintain stability against bitcoin.\n\nWhen this happens bitcoin would have become the worlds reference currency for individuals and after that its only a matter of time before bitcoin becomes the worlds reference currency for institutions and even governments.\n\nThe ironic part is no national currency could possibly maintain value against bitcoin as they are all debasing at such a rapid rate. So as bitcoin becomes the worlds default reference currency it will completely unmask just how weak all national currencies are and cause people to see exactly why they should be saving in bitcoin instead of saving in fiat.","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1678020655.0},{"title":"If you want Bitcoin to succeed, think about running a full node.

Still have both kidneys. Made tons of new friends and business relationships and I have learned so much. \n\nWorking at mining syndicate these last few months have really changed my life. The week after I posted my last post about the job (link in comments) I went to the mining conference hosted by Scott. I got to meet some of you guys in person and you guys remembered my post. It means a lot. Thanks to the people who bought me a drink. You know who you are, mad respect. \n\nSo. Work has been interesting, I got to travel around a little bit looking at new hosting locations. Kansas btw Is 70% gravel roads and super windy. (Yes. I did the \"well I guess we are not in Kansas anymore\" joke when I left). I went to a Texas location where I had to fight off coyotes with a mag light and a Glocko overnight as we are unboxing a box truck full of miners at 3 am. Learned how to operate a 1.5 mw flare gas gen set from cat. Dead ass it's a train engine. \n\nThe environment is interesting.  Texas would be the best man, brides maids and bride at Texas's own wedding. Also. The smallest amount out ice or snow shuts down most of Texas. \n\nCurrently the company is going under some restructuring and things are looking pretty well. Somethings I'm really not happy with, but it's the way she goes. Still going to work my ass off to do what I can to keep machines hashing. They have also decided not to have a 24-7 guy on site. Kinda bummed out about that. I love waking up and going directly to the mine. \n\nI ended up buying my own camper. Grand design imagine bh2800. Love it. Worked my ass off for that. Probably gonna relocate to RV campground some time in the next month or so. I'm assuming that i will be getting assistance with rent as I can't afford the camper and rent to park it and send back money to home. But only time will tell. \n\nI still thoroughly enjoy my job and hopefully I will be able to focus more on the repair side of the company. Have tons of things I want to do in this industry. I don't really know what else to say here lol. Currently back in Ohio up with a sick kid at 1am. \n\nIf you have any questions or something to say. Please comment and I will answer your questions or DM me. :) \n\nWill also post the original post in comments if you wanna read the origin story. \n\n\nUntil next time!

Those miners won't be able to dump anywhere near as much BTC on the market, and the upward pressure on the price will be palpable.  We all know this.  Hell, I saw an article that says over 70% of all BTC has been hodled for over a year now.  \n\nBut with that wealth comes responsibility.  We should be gracious winners, and care about others who are less fortunate.  I propose the following:\n\n\\- Only try the orange pill on someone one time.  After that, leave it.  Talk about the basketball game instead.  More than once, you're bugging them.  They'll figure it out on their own time. \n\n\\- Let's get rid of \"Have fun staying poor.\"  It's just, not a nice thing to say.  We don't need to spike the football.  Better would be \"good luck with your alt-coin\", or whatever.  \n\n\\- Let's also get rid of \"I lost it in a boating accident\".  That's a precious metals kind of saying, and they can have it.  How would you lose BTC in a boating accident anyhow?  If you know your seed words, you'd just go and recover it.  We've already taken the air out of gold and silver with a far better and more scarce asset, and BTC lives in their heads rent-free.  Do we need to steal their saying also?  \n\n\\- Never tell anyone how much BTC you own.  You can tell them in a roundabout way that requires them to do some math and know about BTC, such as \"I have enough BTC that if everyone in New York has as much as I do, there'd be no BTC left.\"  But never give the actual amount.  \n\n\\- Always have a backup wallet, in addition to your daily-use wallet.  And keep the vast majority of your BTC in the backup.  That way if you get robbed, you only lose the daily-use balance.  \n\n\\- Never get frustrated with people who don't come around to thinking BTC is great and who aren't interested in it.  They'll come around on their own in time.  The legacy banking system still works pretty well for most people in the western world, and people are slow to change something that seems to be working.  We have to exercise extreme patience and understanding.  \n\nThat's pretty much it.

KYC which probably takes time and 2. has a $15 withdraw fee for withdrawing bitcoin from the market \n\nIs there any better option? Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized but every single one of the above options requires KYC which probably takes several days to verify. I remember this service that used to exist that allowed you to deposit cash and get bitcoin almost instantly for a relatively small percentage but I can't remember what it was called \n\nThanks","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1677776399.0},{"title":"U.S. Senate on March 1, 2023 passed a disapproval resolution, formally nixed a Biden admin Department of Labor rule that encouraged private retirement plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors when making investment decisions.
