        "text": "Before elaborating my 'theory', I want to make clear that I'm in no way an expert in the field and that I indeed make blunt assumptions based on reasoning without taking real probability numbers into account.\n\nYou are free to join me in my reasoning process or to dismantle it, let's have a discussion!\n\nMy 'theory':\n\nFirst to start off, we are going to depart from the idea that alien life is indeed existent. I'm very convinced that we're not alone in the universe, I actually think it's kinda ignorant (if not foolish) and arrogant to think we're the only living beings in the universe. Like common, sorry to bring it to you, but no we're not the center of a 23 trillion lightyears (that's how big the universe is at MINIMUM)  universe. The size of the universe alone should be a 'valid' proof for alien life.\n\nSo departing from the idea that alien life indeed exists, we're now struck with the problem of how likely living life originates in the universe. We actually have no idea what the rate of 'life' is on planets  (or other celestial bodies that can inhabit life) . We only have our solar system as reference, and even in our own system we really don't know for sure that we're alone, beside earth-centered assumptions based on our perception of what is 'life' and the conditions needed for it, such  as presence of water, temperature, etc.\n\nSo how likely would it be? is it 1 in 5? 1 in 100 or 1 in 10  ? We probably will never know, but it actually doesn't even matter to discuss my theory, as the universe will always be big enough to erase any probability issues.\n\nFollowing that same reasoning path, we can also make the same blunt assumption that it is very unlikely that we're among the most sophisticated societies out there. We can even state that the universe is so big, that intelligent life as we know may not be that intelligent at all compared to other societies that 'hide' in the universe.\n\nBut it isn't really about who is the most sophisticated or not, or even the proximity of such extra terrestrial society. Since the near 'infinity' (or at least to us, humans) size of space should be enough to have at least 1 extra-terrestrial society so advanced enough that it could reach or observe our planet, no matter how far away they are.\n\nLike think of us of a primitive society compared to the vast size of space. We're probably much more intelligent than a lot of living beings out there, since we know that our modern society of today was the result of a very slow process of less or more lucky consecutive events that led us to where we are now.  It would be very probable that if the birth of Earth would be rewound, that we would not evolve at all, or that life would never emerge at all, or would be totally different as we know it now. See, our existence is merely the product of a lot of random events that happened by chance, the actual chance for the earth to have this outcome in another simulation would be drastically low.\n\nWith this in mind we can state for sure that 'a lot' of alien life is less developed as we are, since so much factors come into play to develop to our terms of intelligence, we can exclude all life forms that didn't succeed to develop 'properly' or to our level of intelligence at least. Seen the complex turn of events that led to our society, chances are very probable that there are a lot of extra-terrestrial societies out there that are less sophisticated than we are. Even if all life forms in the universe would have a 100% success outcome on evolving towards an intelligent life form, they would still be limited by the boundaries of the lifespan of the place they are living. For reference, we only got to an 'intelligent' life form near the end of the earth's 'habitable' lifespan. This indicates that there should be a lot of life forms who didn't make it in time to achieve our level of intelligence. Or even that a lot of life forms disappeared again to make place for something new.\n\nAnyway, as much as it is likely that there are living beings out there that are less developed as we are, it's even likely that there exists societies that are far more superior than we are on a level beyond our imagination . Let's say we label the top 0,1 % of living beings in space in terms of intelligence/development as a 'Super society'. We can here again use the size of space to to imply that the technology of those super societies would be sophisticated enough beyond imaginable, being able to map out a vast size of space and travel according to it.\n\nSo let's say the size of space is valid condition for such super societies to exist, this would mean we may be very likely be discovered by them a long time ago and that they are probably very aware of our existence. But if they are in fact aware of our existence and their technology is in fact sophisticated beyond our grasp of knowledge, than they would certainly be able to map out a vast majority of space. This would mean we would merely be one of the enormous amounts of societies they would be aware off. So having in mind the scale of the technology coming from such 'super society' , it would therefore mean that a great part of \"space societies\" should be trackable by them, making it very unlikely for us to be part of the top percentile in terms of development/intelligence. This would mean that a lot of greater societies than ours would be identifiable , even in the non super society category, the 0,1 % like we said earlier.\n\nSince those 'super societies' would have awareness and travel capability to such vast expanse, our existence would be very insignificant to them, seen the great amount of (better) possibilities they can travel to. Not only would we be 1 in maybe millions societies they would know of, making us the one they choose very unlikely. But even if they happened to choose societies randomly, the probability would still be tremendously low because of the enormous lottery we would be part of.\n\nYou could argue that with the resources at their disposal, those 'space powers' could easily explore multiple places at the same time. Making the exploring process much faster than we could imagine. But even in these circumstances we never even caught a glimpse of any kind of presence . \n\nBut who knows, maybe they have here been ever present in our society without us even noticing. After all they should be able to camouflage themselves easily from us, what  in their perspective is merely a prehistorical society.",

        "text": "There is a misconception that ***colonizing the Galaxy*** requires exotic technologies like faster-than-light travel, generation ships, or similar. That is not so. There is a slow and fairly easy way that only needs technology slightly more advanced than ours:\n\nWatch this: [Simulation of Galactic Expansion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNMgtRf0GOg&amp;t=12s)\n\nStars in the galaxy are in random orbits. From time to time, stars randomly come near each other. Not enough to disrupt their planetary systems, but enough to make it relatively easy to hop from one star to the next. The growth rate is exponential, and really accelerates as you approach the denser parts of the galaxy.\n\nIn 1.3 milion years, the [star Gliese 710](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_710) will come within 10,000 AU of the Sun, passing well within the Oort cloud. We already have sketches of [at least](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)) [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Daedalus) [examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_salt-water_rocket) of nuclear propulsion, any of which is expected to reach around 7% the speed of light. The first of these had early tests in the 1960s. If we assume that in practice the average speed is no more than 1-2% the speed of light, you can get to 10,000 AU in 8 - 16 years. Keep in mind that the close encounter will last several thousand years. Plenty of time for space probes, some missions, etc. The first people to go there might be astronauts with zero intention of staying. At some point there would be some colonists who might see the trip as not too different from colonizing other parts of the solar system, comfortable in the knowledge that if they don't like it they can go back home.\n\nBy the time Gliese 710 is moving away from the Sun, its inhabitants will honestly see that star as home. Those pepople will not think of the Solar System as home anymore than Americans think of the northern-European regions of Old Saxony and Anglia (birthplace of Anglo-Saxons) as \"home\".\n\n**A galaxy can be colonized with only slightly more technology than we already possess, and without any one person actually intending to colonize the galaxy.**",

Given the exponential increase in technology, be it new telescoped and ways of detection, what’re the odds that you think we detect other intelligent life relatively soon? In my opinion, it is mathematically impossible for there not to be intelligent life somewhere out there. In fact i’d go as far to say that there’s hundreds or thousands of intelligent species out there, it is simply the vastness of space as to why we haven’t found anything yet. Furthermore, I think people tend to overestimate our current ability to detect other life, aswell as how much / far we have actually searched",
