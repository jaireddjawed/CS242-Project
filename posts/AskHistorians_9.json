My understanding is that the earliest disco scenes were quite diverse in terms of the participants’ racial backgrounds — in a way that was almost utopian, in fact, in that it broke down social barriers in service of a shared ecstatic, communal experience. Did that continue as disco went more mainstream in the late 1970s? Was Studio 54 a fairly mixed crowd? If you went outside the major metro areas to disco clubs in, say, Buffalo or Cleveland or Jackson or Albuquerque in 1977 and ‘78, would you find a diverse crowd at your average dance club playing Chic and Donna Summer, or would individual clubs have catered to primarily white or Black dancers only?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11n7kwb/can_we_determine_the_ancient_minoan_language/",
        "text": "Hello AskHistorians!\n\nI have a question about Minoan Civilization - namely - can we piece together what some of the contemporaneous Minoan words + pronunciation that existed before the Mycenae \"invasion\" and replacement of Linear A with Linear B.\n\n**Here's why I'm asking****:**\n\nI was recently listening to the Podcast series 'History of English Podcast', which outlined the history behind the proto-indo-european language and its subsequent spread to other Indo-European languages across Europe and Asia. We know that the Myceaneans spoke an Indo-European language and wrote in Linear B, while the Minoans (probably) didn't speak an Indo-European language.\n\nIn the proto-indo-european language, they had words specifically about quasi-Steppe culture of animal husbandry, honey, honeybees, and the like. They were also (allegedly) incredibly patriarchal, without words for women (instead, they were simply wives, which I assume, meant that women were some sort of class of property). The rationale that makes sense to me is that the language grew out of the goods, services, objects, and actions relevant to the community that spoke the language.\n\nI also learned about linguistic 'laws' - i.e. Grimm's Laws - and the movement of sounds and inflections over time. I also remember reading recently that we've catalogued hundreds of thousands of Ancient Greek names (not, I assume, from the Bronze Age) over time.\n\n**So here's my hypothesis**. \n\nThe Minoan language (and its greater family) was probably spoken around the Mediterranean, to some extent, for quite some time at the same time the indo-europeans were spreading out around the area as well. I assume that, because trade was so integral to the Mediterranean world, and there was a heavy economic incentive to speak the same language in order to trade, there were significant pressures to conform to some sort of Minoan-Mediterranean language prior to the introduction of Indo-European. By looking at the ways in which words were pronounced, shifted while in contact with other geographic areas (like, say, if a name went from CH-AOS to K-AOS, perhaps it could mean that the language neighbor emphasized the \"k\" sound over the \"ch\" sound, as an example). Furthermore, maybe we have other historical examples of what happens to language, words, and pronunciation when a language family that includes significant inflection usage (Indo-European) interacts with a language with an (alleged) Verb+Subject+Object structure (Minoan).\n\nFurthermore, when the Mycenaeans encountered the Minoan civilization, they had to, by necessity, borrow a lot of words from the Minoan vocabulary to make sense of these new words and concepts that they had never encountered before - kings (wanax), boats, ships, wine, olives, etc. So what would come to American English as \"Ohio\" was originally the \"Ohi-yo.\" We know the place names kept their non-Greek names. So why couldn't other words for ships, olives, frescos, and the like transfer? Plus, since the Minoans appear to be significantly less patriarchal, perhaps a lot of the female-related words  came directly from the Minoan?\n\nSo couldn't we log all known instances (and any known pronunciations) across the Mediterranean in some sort of computer system, code it for time and geographic area, test the pronunciation changes with our known linguistic laws, note the changes, and then, by a kind of reverse-engineering, come up with a semblance of a **Minoan language**?\n\nSorry if this was a bit daft or long-winded.",

If so, why did these never translate into the same counterinsurgency capabilities of the British military, and, if not, why did they not think of these conflicts in such a manner?",

Part of the famous Gobekli Tepe region discovery from south eastern Turkey, it was discovered in the Karahan Tepe site and dates back to around 9000 BCE. According to the director it depicts a Leopard “standing” on the shoulders of a human individual, but the bent over posture of the individual and mounting posture of the top figure limbs positioned on the shoulders is highly suggestive of a sexual act. [Other carvings](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2022/12/08/oldest-known-depiction-of-narrative-scene-found-in-turkey) and images found at the same site site appear to show human figures in states of arousal or with their hands on their privates, again flanked again by leopards and other animals. Large phallus carvings are [also found](https://www.easternturkeytour.org/karahan-tepe/) in other areas of the site. \n\nThe original purpose and function of the Gobekli Tepe network of sites remains a mystery and proto-religious or ceremonial aspect has been cited as one of the more likely explanations. Were this all the case, to what extent can this be said to be a unique or unusual occurrence for neolithic proto-religious symbology and depiction? We’re familiar with the more recent mythology eg Zeus posing as a bull and swan, or the Boto river dolphin stories of the Amazon, but is it possible this is a first?\n\nMany thanks for any insights",

Though she and her partner had both contributed to the paid-off mortgage, only the dead woman's name was actually on the house's title. Maybe it's because I've mostly lived through decades where queer people had worked out strategies for cobbling together some of the legal rights that marriage grants, but it seemed incredibly short-sighted to me that an elderly couple, particularly, wouldn't have taken *any* measures to ensure that both of them had a legal claim to their shared property, such as ensuring wills were drawn up to leave each other everything.\n\n* To what degree is this an accurate representation of how a typical WLW couple would have behaved in that era (versus, e.g., how likely it is to be a more general illustration of the ways that queer couples were/are delegitimized—particularly given that the movie was written and released at a time when we were pushing for marriage rights)?\n\n* More broadly, what rights did any unmarried woman have in 1961 to decide how her property would be disposed of after her death? And were there any changes in prior decades, such that an elderly woman might not have yet adjusted to new circumstances that would have given her greater rights?",

Local tribes of different cultures like Apaches also proved impossible to directly conquer, scoring several victories over Spanish army, and northern expansion of colonial territory stopped abruptly.  \nSpaniards then started to build missions as a second attempt of taming those lands. Missions were meant as centers of Eurpean civilization, aiming to subdue local population through conversion and creating local workforce that could create profit for the Spanish crown.\n\nWhat was the everyday reality of those settlements? How much did they differ from each other? Were thay brutal slave driving camps?  Did the clergy create a system separate from the main colonies (something like monasteries operating by their own rules)? Where can we find information about these institutions and how reliable it is? Can we trust Protestant or Catholic accounts on the matter in the context of great conflicts raging in Europe and propaganda on both sides?",
