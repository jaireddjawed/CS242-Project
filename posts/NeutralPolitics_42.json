Daalder, a former United States envoy to NATO who is now the director of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “Today, the United States is heading into a direction on key issues that seems diametrically opposite of where Europe is heading. Merkel’s comments are an acknowledgment of that new reality.”\n\nIn addition to the question in the title (Does Merkel's statement have precedent?), I have two other questions:\n\n1) How do Germany and other European countries rely on the U.S.? \n\n2) Did this statement come suddenly or is it indicative of a trend?",

He is sometimes [compared to Steve Bannon](http://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-donald-trump-jared-kushner-vladimir-putin-russia-fbi-mafia-584962), but unlike Bannon who has an official role in the Trump administration Dugin seems to be typically described as just a philosopher or political scientist, so his role is unclear to me.\n\nArticles like [this one](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38639327) ambiguously claim that he is \"believed to have the ear of the Kremlin\", but what do we really know about the extent of his influence? I can't tell if he is really as influential as people claim, or if people just cite his book because the goals it lines out are fairly sensational, scary and attention-grabbing. \n\nDoes he have direct influence in Putin's administration in any way, or is he just political theorist and intellectual with no official ties? Does his ideology accurately reflect the foreign policy goals of the Kremlin? \n\nHow mainstream are his ideas? Do some in Russia think of him as some sort of extremist?\n\nWhat sort of influence does he have outside of Russia in parts of the world which he seems to want to align Russia with, such as Iran?",

We can't know what his decision will be without speculating too much. However, we can ask what decision is politically optimal? \n\nThis question has 2 parts. First one is how wide is a space of decisions, whether it's completely binary (accept/not accept agreement) or there is a set of points in between?\n\nAnd second part is what decision represents common ground between positions of his supporters and opponents? Of course, if it's possible to find some compromise at all. \n\nFull text of Paris agreement is accessible from [here](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php). A summary is [here](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en#tab-0-0) (unfortunately, I haven't found one that is both clear and concise). \n\nEDIT: here are some graphs on public opinion: about [global warming](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/ps_2016-10-04_politics-of-climate_0-02/) and [paris agreement](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Politics-and-Global-Warming-November-2016-01.png)(86% of dems and 51% of reps support it).

Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications.\n\nAccording to [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/27/jared-kushner-hr-mcmaster-not-concerned-238885), National Security Advisor General McMaster responded to questions about the report by with this:\n\n&gt;“We have backchannel communications with a number of countries.

The provisions dealing with health insurance coverage would reduce the deficit, on net, by $783 billion; the noncoverage provisions would increase the deficit by $664 billion, mostly by reducing revenues.\n\nAnd with respect to health insurance coverage:\n\n&gt;CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured under H.R. 1628 than under current law. The increase in the number of uninsured people relative to the number projected under current law would reach 19 million in 2020 and 23 million in 2026. In 2026, an estimated 51 million people under age 65 would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law. Under the legislation, a few million of those people would use tax credits to purchase policies that would not cover major medical risks.\n\nWhat new do we learn from this report about the changes made to the AHCA, as well as the overall merits of the legislation as voted on?\n\n---\n\nMod note: I am posting this on behalf of the mod team as we're getting a lot of questions about the report/AHCA.",

The article points out that this is contrary to Speaker Ryan's insistence on obeying House rules regarding the voting clock, which implies that perhaps this technique for securing votes has been used previously. Has it, or is this behavior unusual? Does the difference between keeping the electronic voting open versus requiring members to change votes publicly in \"the well\" matter within that context?",

Or is Dershowitz right that the President has the right to fire the Director of the FBI and that even if he was covering up collusion he was not committing a crime?",
