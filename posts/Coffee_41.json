I wipe any drips immediately and try to keep the warming plate clean and dry, but eventually the black coating starts coming off, etc.  Thank you for any thoughts--",

        "text": "This is my first actual Coffee machine, in the past I had owned a Keurig but could never get into it enough. \n\nI've been living off local coffee shops for years and going for the best taste/ best convenience which ended up being Starbucks mobile orders for Americanos &amp; Nitro Cold Brews.\n\nA friend of mine recommended the Ninja Hot &amp; Cold Brew system and after reading some here as well as reviews I settled on it.\n\nNow comes a few of my questions and I'm hoping there are some good pointers and direction.\n\nFirst, I've been using ground coffee from the store and I'm assuming this is my first mistake but I went for the ease and quick convenience. I noticed the first few Cold Brews were decent enough, they actually seem to pour over nicer when the mug has ice in it. However there was always a chalky/ silt bottom of the mug that was just water and grounds. I assume this can be done away with paper filters? Is there any actual preference over these or is just a simple paper filter fine. Is it even necessary?\n\nSecond, that ties into the first, is a grinder and whole beans going to truly make the difference? I did some quick searches around and it seems a lot of people are in favor of Barzata Encore grinders as a decent grinder. Is this true, is there a better alternative? Is a cheaper $20 grinder a waste, or is spending ~$110 on a grinder a waste?\n\nand last, finding the right coffee.. I drink my coffee black, no cream or sugar but I also don't enjoy a burnt taste or bland approach. It's nice to get a good and rich flavor in there but how do you settle on something? Do people usually switch around and stick with a few brands? Retail stores seem to mostly have the same few brands similar to how going to the beer aisle is the same usual beers. However I went to a local grocer and they had coffee beans from companies around my area and was curious do most of these companies truly have a unique approach and bean or are they all just buying the same thing to resell as their own?",

It was around 7 pm and I immediately fell asleep upon arriving home and sleep the entire night. (Which is very very unusual for me. I have a sleep condition) The next day I felt increased heart rate and extreme fatigue. \n\nI slept the entire day away. The next day (today) I sleep the entire night again and woke up extremely tired again. I’ve been tired this entire day as well. I called my buddy who put me on and he went through the same thing but felt fine today. \n\nWhat gives? Is it a coffee withdrawal? Should I be worried? Should I stay away from coffee? Should I limit intake? \n\n\nEverything was fine until I tried the seasonal stuff \n\nI’m tempted to drink coffee now (I have a coffee machine) \nPreviously all I drank was a gallon of water daily \n\nPlease help",

We want something SCAA Certified with temperature control, thermal carafe and the ability to set pre-infusion (bonus if we can set the length of pre-infusion). Added bonus if it's larger than 8 cups. The Moccamaster is highly recommended and I get that, but what gives us pause about it is that the temperature cannot be adjusted (correct me if I'm wrong). We're so far down this rabbit hole that we have specific temperatures that we brew different roasts.

Main comments should be flavour profiles or general categories of coffee; people can respond with beans they've enjoyed. Obviously, what 'cheaper' beans are is open to interpretation, but if we stay away from 'competition-level beans,' I think it can be a useful thread without sticking to a dollar amount.\n\n**The (unnecessary) story behind this:**\n\nI treated myself to some excellent coffee and Sibarist papers over the holidays; they have been the tastiest cups I've ever had. However, calculating how much each cup brewed at home cost me was a bit of a 'yikes' moment. Now I'm looking for fast papers that don't cost quite so much (I hear Origami ones are fast), but I'm also looking for great coffees that are on the cheaper end.",

It was often inconsistent in taste even though I measured everything. \n\nRecently I read about how the coppers naturally great thermal conductivity might not be so good for making coffee(since it draws heat from the slurry) and started to take pre-heating the brewer more seriously. What I did was boil up around 500mg water and poured it onto the copper brewer when I had my grounds and water for the brewing ready. That made my coffee taste more consistent and quite good most of the time. A bit bland for my taste tho. \n\nJust after christmas I found my old plastic",

        "text": "Hello,  \nAs the titles states, I am curious to know if the Sette 270’s gearbox/motor issues have been resolved. I have heard anecdotal evidence that there was an update and these issues no longer exist and that even the sound has been dampened by 50%. I saw a post on r/coffee relating to the Encore getting an update to its gasket, so it’s clear there are mechanical updates happening. But unfortunately, I could not find any official info from Baratza about the Sette, so it feels risky buying a grinder that has a reputation of mechanical issues. Hoping someone that has bought one in the past couple years can shed some light on the legitimacy of this supposed updated version. \nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "I recently had a Turkish coffee at a cafe that not only had lots of creama that Turkish coffee is famous for, it also had an amazing richness and texture throughout the drink. I am trying to replicate this at home, here is how I'm making it:\n\n1. Turn on electric stove to medium heat (aware that a gas stove would be better but using what I have).\n\n\n\n2. Measure water using demitasse cup and boil in electric kettle.\n\n\n\n3. Add water to cezve.\n\n\n\n4. Add one teaspoon of sugar and one teaspoon of Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi grounds per demitasse cup to cezve.\n\n\n\n5. Stir mixture about 10 times.\n\n\n\n6. Heat cezve until coffee begins to foam (about 3 minutes).\n\n\n\n7. Pour into cups, let sit for about 3 minutes so grounds settle and coffee cools down.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for improving my Turkish coffee, especially in terms of getting a thicker texture and richness? That is the main thing I'm missing, I manage to get a decent amount of creama doing it this way. Thank you for your help 👍",

        "text": "Thought I'd share my experience in case it's helpful to others. For context, I've been making single-serving pour over coffees every morning for 5-6 years. I grind my own beans and use a ceramic dripper + filter. I've heard good anecdotal impressions of Cometeer so I decided to give it a try.\n\nI purchased a single shipment (pilot program) which included 4 boxes of 8 pods for $74 including shipping.\n\nCometeer costs: $74 for 32 pods = $2.30 per pod. I was assuming that 1 pod = 1 brew (spoiler: it does not).\n\nMy typical costs: $15 bag of beans, \\~10 brews per bag = $1.50 per brew.\n\nMy typical brew process takes 10-15 minutes, so I wouldn't be saving a ton of time, but morning minutes are precious so I was willing to see if the time savings were worth the increase in cost.\n\nFor my first trial, I decided to test both brew processes side by side. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that 1 pod ≠ 1 brew. It took 3 pods before it started tasting like a comparable coffee, and I would have added a 4th but I didn't want to spend $9.20 on my first brew ($6.90 was bad enough!).\n\nFrom my experience, Cometeer costs 4-5x more than my typical brew process. Even compared to cafe prices it costs about 2x more. Given that, I won't be purchasing more Cometeer coffee and I cannot recommend it for anyone that has the ability to spend a few minutes brewing their own coffee at a fraction of the price.",
