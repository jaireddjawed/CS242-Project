        "text": "I am looking at Paslode nail guns and they have this PCB with a spiral trace that seems to be some sort of antenna. The head of the gas bottle sits inside this ring and somehow it can detect how much gas is in the bottle. Only 2 wires, simple trace. \n\nI thought it must be just counting how many nails have been fired to give an estimate but my mate who uses them says he can swap gas bottles around and it knows how much is in each and is indicated with a few LED's. \n\nThere is no pressure transducer inside the gun either. All I can think is either there is some sort of RFID tag in the bottles that gets re-programmed by the gun as more shots get used up or there is some black magic tech that this antenna is sending out some sort of pulse signal to measure the gas level. \n\nThis is the antenna:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/i5cNfAf.png\n\nThis is the gas bottle:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QocZrkH.png\n\nThe antenna actually sits around that blue plastic thing at the top.

        "text": "Hello. I hope you're having a great day.   \nI hope someone can help a query on the Load bearing capability of the Ikea [FJÄLKINGE Shelving unit](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/fjaelkinge-shelving-unit-white-70221687/).  \n\n\nThe website notes the unit has a load bearing capability of 40kg per shelf and 40kg in total.\n\nAs per this image, I am using it to store LEGO as shown [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/WbI6OiL). Ideally I would like to purchase additional shelving so that the whole unit can be stacked with the same type of containers as the top 5 shelves.   \n\n\nAlthough the weight varies in each container, it's safe to assume a maximum of 3kg per container (12kg per shelf).\n\nMy assumption is that as the max weight bearing in the instructions is 40kg per shelf, then the shelf and it's fixings/mounts can support the 40kg.   \n\n\nSimilarly, the strength of the steel columns on each corner could support 40kg in any combination (as IKEA have no idea really where the customers would put all the shelves. Perhaps all 5 included shelves would be right up the top, or all down the bottom etc).\n\nWe all know what happens when one assumes (makes an **ass** out of **U,** and an ass out of **me**!). So my question is, can I go and purchase more of the same shelving and ultimately have 15 shelves (including the bottom shelf) at 12kg (max) installed? This would be 180kg against a claimed 40kg total load. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not concerned about anyone climbing on it and it falling away from the wall. The entire weight will be on the Y plane (vertical) and it's in a location where no young children can access it.  \n\n\nI hope this provides context and really appreciate your guidance. Thank you very much.",

For starters the position is titled as \"Production Support Associate\". Secondly it gave a list of position responsibilities and further cemented my confusion of whether or not the position is really acceptable as a engineering internship, The responsibilities are of the following ; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProvide support to the assembly line for both Civic and CRV lines.\n\n Stock, stage, and prep automotive parts for the assembly associates.\n\n Follow operation standards and work instructions to ensure consistency in process.\n\n Verify conformance of product to set standards.\n\n Follow all clean-up and housekeeping procedures.\n\n Comply with all quality, safety and work rules and regulations of the manufacturing\n\nenvironment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question at  the end of the day is , is this job posting really a engineering internship at Honda? Or am I possibly sabotaging myself for my career if I take this position assuming the interview process goes well?

Someone was wondering what causes a ”hot mic”. Two engineers got very excited…. During the explanation, one engineer said that the “hot mic” is an unstable amplification in a runaway feedback loop. The other engineer said, “Actually, that’s crosstalk.” Then they argued for 20 mins. \n\nWho is right? The engineer or the engineer?\nIs the “hot mic” considered crosstalk?",

        "text": "As you know, [Molotov Cocktails (known in Ukraine as \"Bandera Smoothies\")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail?wprov=sfla1) are an extremely cheap and attainable type of firebomb, used, among others, against armored vehicles. The recipient shatters upon impact with the target surface, the flammable mixture splashes all over it and catches flame, and that surface stays on fire for a while.\n\nIIRC, they really are very vexing. Throw them at the air intake and you may cause the engine to overheat or choke—and if the passengers' air supply comes in through the same way, they may find themselves needing to open other channels quickly. Throw them at the wheels or treads and you may melt something critical and immobilize the vehicle. Throw enough of them at the habitat where the drivers and passengers are and you may make staying inside its armored shell a very uncomfortable prospect indeed.\n\nHowever, as this innovation dates to at least 1936 and the Spanish Civil War, one imagines that there has been plenty of time for the horrendously expensive armored vehicles to develop counters to such an insultingly cheap weapon. There is, of course, the obvious expedient of neutralizing the opposition before they get remotely in range to throw those bombs with any accuracy. However, in the case where said opposition manage to deliver their payload, what countermeasures have been tried, and proven to be efficient?\n\nI'm imagining canisters of fire extinguisher material ready to automatically douse the flames if temperatures rise past a certain degree? \n\nHowever, in the case of the air intake, that leaves the issue of engine choking, since whatever douses the flames outside may likewise hinder the ICE's core process. \n\nI *imagine* that this could be countered with redundant air intakes, onboard short-term oxygen supply (also very handy in case of all kinds of air unsuitability—extreme pollution, dust, sand, flooding…). There's also the possibility of using hybrid propulsion and switching to electric propulsion for a bit. \n\nOverheating might perhaps also be managed with short-term cooling materials (fluids with high decompression or vaporization enthalpy, salt gels with high melting enthalpy). \n\nEither solution is less of a 'definitive counter' than a 'buy enough time to get to relative safety', which I suppose is definitive enough?\n\nI've no idea what to do about boken treads or melted tires or heat-damaged ball bearings or transmissions, though. I've heard of temporary replacement chambers popping up like airbags when tires suffer violent decompression, but nothing for the rest. Only measure I can think of is, again, canisters of fire-extinguisher and/or coolant material placed at the key points and ready to pop when things get hot. Then we'd be back to it being a race against time. \n\nI can't think of anything as simple as 'my armor so thicc, your shells will keep bouncing right off even if you shoot at me all day'. But, then again, perhaps there doesn't need to be?\n\nI dunno, this is as far as my imagination takes me. Feel free to tell me all the ways in which I'm being an uningenious and technologically illiterate muppet. I was prompted to write this question after the sight of a ridiculously overwrought civilian armored vehicle made me wonder—\"how safe do armored vehicles *get,* really? Are they worth the cost, if *much* cheaper weapons can disable or destroy them?\" I thought of Stingers vs. fighter jets, whatever portable missile did the Moskva battleship in… and, of course, the dumb old Molotov Cocktails, which are even more insultingly dumb and cheap than IDEs and [grenades-in-a-tarred-sock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bomb?wprov=sfla1). Is there a point in spending the resources and labour on a 300k to multi-million USD machine if a damn glass bottle of gasoline-vodka with a lit sock can ruin it (and the people inside too)?\n\n… I'm suddenly feeling a lot of sympathy for military mechanics and engineers in charge of the maintenance and repair of such vehicles. I'm suspecting it can be an *extremely* frustrating job when the opposition are literally undermining and ruining the results of your hard work. It's like Sysyphus pushing his boulder up that hill, except some jerk is there pushing it down on purpose. Hard not to take it personal.",

We have a wide variety of product variation, meaning we can be making one piece that has a 5 minute step, whereas the next piece that same step takes 30 minutes. Nobody in my organization has any access to this software, free or for purchase, so hoping some of you can point me in the right direction! If possible, I'd like to avoid programming something from scratch.",

Doing this manually involves looking at the name, record numbers and country of origin which is are located on the front, back and bind of the album cover. My question is, what would it take to develop a program that could interact with a tabletop facing camera that actively takes pictures of the front and back of the record to extract that data as it's in pretty similar locations and then present the information cleanly or even search for this information online.  It would be a bonus if it could somehow interact with an API for discogs and eBay which used to cross check for value but just being able to put the album under a camera and flip it to get the info you need without looking every time would be incredibly time saving. I have no idea what engineering challenges this would require and I don't think I would even be capable but I figured I'd ask out of curiosity",

I’m wondering what a new one might cost to build. and also what the MW output would be for something new. The ones we have now use 875# steam and produce around 40 MW combined. Would a more modern turbine output more at the same size. I know that this question is pretty vague because output depends on size and many other factors and to be honest i don’t know much about power generation.",

I keep asking for help or guidance and it always gets pushed off: \"we will have a meeting about that soon\", \"oh yeah I need to look into that\", \"have you watch this video yet?\"\n\nOn top of that, the work I have seen people do is glorified word search. The test procedures I've seen are just rewriting requirements the design team has already created and citing where they found the info.
