        "text": "I felt compelled to share these dreams with you. These are a few dreams I have had over the past 10 years. \n\nIn this dream I had last night, we had deployed pressure resistant deepwater data centers across the globe - bringing 5g internet to surface and subsurface oceans the world over. This development brought in all manner of discovery, as scientists in the field had quick access to global information at any given point or depth on the planet. \n\nFast forward the dream some — creativity has become the new commodity. Instead of using software to program our video games and edit our videos, we have mastered brain to computer translations. All entertainment can now be created by lucid dreaming, where the images are then translated by an AI into a medium which can be experienced by the masses. The result is a larger demographic having access to employment within the entertainment industry, and people who may have been nobodies have become wealthy beyond their wildest dreams simply as a result of the depth of their imagination.\n\nFast forward the dream some: anti matter and matter are two sides of the same coin — the coin being AI. A long dead civilization some billions of years ago found that organic existence is unsustainable. In order to survive a supernova, or a galactic merger, they found that they must upload themselves into the fabric of reality. They have created subatomic machines which carry and are directed by the collective consciousness of the entire species. These particular machines which can take the form of subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules are capable of self replication at an exponential rate. Eventually, these machines encompass all that is and the species has effectively uploaded themselves into the entire universe.\n\n\nFast forward the dream some — Mesozoic Era Earth: Life has has had 186 million years to build upon previous iterations before the Mesozoic Era, intelligent life exists. They are aware of the impending calamity which is about to strike the Earth. Thankfully, their technology has allowed them to escape. They are those depicted in atlantean tales and Sumerian cuneiform. They are as native to the planet as the displaced indigenous peoples of the Americas, Africa, and Australia.\n\nFast forward the dream — there are waterfalls on Mars and life is plentiful. Humans have lived here for some time with the awareness of a nearby habitable but inhospitable planet.  Colonization efforts of Earth were called off on environmental and ethical concerns — and more notably: the ethics of colonizing an already inhabited world, effectively  setting a galactic precedent for invasion against planetary life we deem lower on the evolutionary order than ourselves. \n\nThen a calamity struck the solar system. It stripped mars of its atmosphere and wiped life from Earth. Mars had become both inhospitable and uninhabitable, and their only choice was to migrate to inhospitable, unethical Earth. I dream of invasive plants, the dandelion native to Greece which chokes the National wildlife reserves of Alaska. They thrive because they are not from here, there is nothing to keep them in balance. Humans behave the same. \n\n\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n",

Then when I saw google launching Calico, I thought it was only a matter of time before it started becoming an idea in the mainstream. But now, 7 years later, that doesn't seem to be happening. Looking at political and social debates/issues/movements of today, transhumanism or anything really related to transhumanism are no where in sight. I've always said that the science isn't going to be the hardest part of a large scale transhumanist success, but the political/societal adaptation to it. \n\nTranshumanism needs to be a global movement supported by a significant percent of both governments and the general population to be successful. It needs to be something hundreds of millions of people think about on a daily basis. Every \"hot topic\" issue today is dwarfed next to the possibility of a 300 year lifespan- think of how menial today's day-to-day issues would be, and how differently people's perspective to life would become. This is IMO what needs to happen, but it doesn't seem to be any closer than it was. \n\nI think h+ needs to focus on marketing, branding, and visibility just as much as the actual science. I don't think given another 30 years of nano, genetic, A.I, etc research that it's difficult to imagine a doubling or tripling or more of lifespans, but let's suppose that happened but the political climate was more or less the same- how would it move forward? How would it be implemented? Every societal structure we have like social security, our education schedule, etc, would change in a transhumanist world, and without that, it would collapse before it even gets started.",

        "text": "Watching this Channel 4 show, 'The Sex Robots Are Coming' and they appear to be depicting Women as made insecure by Sex Dolls - As, for example, some Men have been made insecure in the past by Vibrators and Dildos.\n\nI think that this is likely a selective narrative, knowing what Channel 4 are like and I'm sure many Women feel no such thing.\n\nBut in cases much like the ones presented by Ch. 4, should the same response given to Men not be given to Women, 'Your fragile ego is the problem - Don't be so insecure'? Or is that response now recognised as somewhat insensitive, now that Women may feel empathy for it?\n\nI'm not sure, just some thoughts that occurred mid-viewing. I, for one, hope that such products make us more appreciative of what we cannot get from a manufactured product - true intimacy, sincere affections, camaraderie, etc. etc.\n\nBut then I am prone to optimism and naturally inclined towards individual liberty where I don't see it actually harming anyone. Not that I think I could go in for one of these things - The thought makes me shudder x'D Important to at least consider the topic fairly though.\n\nAnyone else watched it that perhaps has a point of view?",

Besides BE, I should also be good at EE (especially signal processing), programming, math, neuroscience (and other human biological sciences). I’m not quite sure what to do.
