        "text": "I'm a recent PhD in the humanities, USA, and have just been invited to my first campus visit. I have a lot of specific dietary restrictions for medical reasons, and I don't want to make things awkward or seem high maintenance, but I also don't want to end up having bad reactions to foods and being unable to perform well in the interview events, or having embarrassing medical issues in front of everyone, etc. After reading some advice online and talking to one advisor I did email the office admins organizing my trip to politely let them know my dietary restrictions and ask if it would be an issue. They gave the name of the place they were planning to have a dinner event and the place they use for lunch catering. I called the dinner restaurant and they aren't able to make anything I can eat. I can't eat anything as-is from the lunch catering either, unless they were able to request a special version of one dish without some of the ingredients on it. Should I let them know I won't be able to eat at the dinner place and ask if it would be possible to request a lunch without certain ingredients? Or plan on bringing my own food to everything? Or just not eat while I'm at interview events? I don't want to make a fuss but I also know (from going to meals for events in my own department as a grad student) it can be really socially awkward and make others uncomfortable if we all go to a restaurant and I don't eat anything, or it could make people feel offended if I bring my own food to everything. Would really appreciate some advice - thanks to anyone who can help.",

In particular, I would like to pursue a PhD in Applied Mathematics. Outside of academia, what kinds of roles do such Math PhDs go into? I think I would prefer to work in the world of quantitative finance in a quant researcher role, but I am still curious and open to other roles Math PhDs tend to go into. I saw that some tech companies such as Apple hire PhDs in researcher roles, but they seem to be geared towards Computer Science or ML PhDs. Is it still possible for a Math PhD to go into such a role? Are there any other roles I am overlooking? I just want to know what I can reasonably expect the job market to look like after completing my PhD.\n\nBTW, I am not planning on pursuing the PhD solely because I want to go into quantitative finance but rather because I really want to research and explore areas of applied mathematics deeper.",

But I'm in humanities, a field in which the lack of lab equipment could be considered a blessing, since I have no excuses to not be writing, and a curse, in the sense that there are no jobs, and few jobs available are poorly paid. In any case, in humanities I think, it is not always easy to dicern serious and insightful research from fluff, and this especially true when one starts reading into disciplines that are notoriously obscure (literary theory, jungian and lacan psychoanalysis, a lot of postmodernists too).\n\nI think I can write, sometimes, and it did not take me long to write an acceptable essay (\"acceptable\" based on that I usually get high or perfect grades in essays), and it's not a terrible effort to write a paper to send to a magazine either. Still, I am not sure at this point if I what I'm writing makes any sense at all: my work is between philosophy, theology, and literature. Sometimes I think I am pure bullshit, and if anything gets published, is because I have mastered the academic jargon to make all the fluff seem serious.

        "text": "Hello people,\n\nI would very much appreciate some guidance and advice.\n\nI graduated from MSc in Neuroscience a couple of years ago. I very much enjoyed doing it and thought I'll be in academia since I've known myself. So I started my Phd in one of the best Unis. I hated it. I had 2 PIs who made my life miserable, the project was not at all as described pre-hiring, I was miserable and depressed more and more each day and it started to affect my health. So I quit. It was incredibly hard but I think it was the right choice because even though I enjoy research and neuroscience, I really don't want to be tied to a lab every single day. But the problem was, I did not know what else I could be doing with my life and was very disappointed that one thing I knew did not work out... So I thought it was probably the position itself and not the path and kept looking for other PhD positions in computational neuroscience which felt more exciting. I searched for a year, interviewed for a couple of positions but I couldn't get any. I tried to find jobs but I'm a non-EU foreigner in an EU country hence doesn't allow work permits that easily. Eventually, I've decided to do a second MSc in artificial intelligence because I realized I had to be unique and this would be a great path since it's in high demand and I genuinely am interested in neuroinformatics.\n\nI'm about to finish my first semester now. I enjoyed the studies so far, but it is very difficult and very different from what I've been doing since so many years. And I am terrified whether I am making a mistake since it is such a big commitment (will take 3 years) and whether I should get a job (most likely will have to leave the country and all life I've built here). I can't silence the disappointed voice saying \"I already have a MSc for which I've worked so hard for, why do I have to suffer more now, what use will this be at the end\". I'm also terrified thinking what if I also don't like this field? I feel like you only know when you really get into it.  \nHas anyone been through a similar experience? Do you think a second MSc worthwhile or more a waste of time and just hiding behind a degree?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts, thank you :)",

        "text": "I am currently pursuing graduate studies and I have recently witnessed 2 situations that made me question the legitimacy of the peer-reviewing process and scientific publications.\n\n1. A friend of mine is currently working on his thesis, and some results from the code developed at their lab are not so good, because the code is very young, made by one person with not much coding background, and hasn't been rigorously tested on many problem instances. My friend wanted to make a comment about this in his thesis/paper to explain that results still could be improved if the code was more adapted to this specific case, but his advisor was totally against it. The advisor, which is also an evaluator on the thesis jury, refused to validate the thesis/submit the paper as long as that small paragraph was not removed, saying that it is simply not true and that it would impact negatively future results published by students from the lab (even though they all agree with my friend, even the person who made the code). I am utterly shocked that an experienced researcher would suggest this, and IMO it is bad science. Most importantly, the department director does not want to intervene since he is also member of the jury, and said to my friend to go to the faculty if he wanted to contest this decision, a process that could eventually take months, just to get his diploma.\n\n2. I assisted to a seminar given by a professor who did a literature review of over a hundred papers from medicine journals since the end of the 90's about Alzheimer disease modelization. He said that many of them had numerical experiments described by parameters, but that with those parameters, the simulations would often fail to reproduce the results presented in the papers, and after contacting the authors, they openly said that the parameters were not the right ones. Even with the new allegedly correct set of parameters, the simulations could sometimes not even be reproduced. The results were possibly fudged.\n\nI am surprised about the level of dishonesty that seems to emanate from the world of academic publication. Is it THAT common that numbers/results are fudged in papers/thesis just to make the authors look good? Do people do this to justify more funding? Is it just a coincidence that shortly after I begin my journey in academia I see many people lie/hide critical info in peer-reviewed papers, or is it very common?\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences about senior researchers encouraging them to hide stuff or censoring them if they don't hide some information? What did you do about it?",

From my search, I also know a few math/stats professors from the Bay area earning around 90-95K, which I believe is not very high given the crazy cost of living there. \n\nI know this is a very complicated question since it depends a lot on the specific city, field, institution type (private/public, R1/R2, teaching, etc.), and also the spouse, so I guess I just want to know some perspectives. I am in math/stats if you are curious. In general, I want to see if one can live comfortably as a professor or not, so even if you are not living in a big city, you can also share your stories (I guess expensive college towns like Santa Barbara can be interesting case studies).\n\nThank you so much.",

        "text": "Hello! About to be a last-semester senior here in undergrad here, majoring in Journalism and English. The plan right now is to take a gap year after graduation and apply to PhD programs this time next year. I have a pretty solid GPA, but I feel like I'm not adequate enough in every other aspect of my grad application. With one semester left of undergrad, what should I be doing to better strengthen my applications? I'm planning on applying to American Studies programs to focus on environmental humanities - specifically the history of the environmental movement and how contemporary depictions of the environment influence environmental thinking. \n\nSo far, I only have one research paper submitted for publication. The rest of my research experience comes from class assignments and the like. Is it possible to try and get another publication under my belt by doing some independent research and submitting it to a journal that publishes undergraduate work? What do the expectations regarding published research look like when it comes to humanities programs? From what I've gathered, research in the humanities is structured vastly different than research in STEM - there's no lab to join as a research assistant in the English or History departments here. Since everything is so independently oriented, I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing. I'm attempting to set up a formal independent study with a professor for my last semester, but that's still up in the air bc the last professor I attempted to set one up with was just too busy this upcoming semester to take one on. \n\nAdditionally, I've been an editor at my school's newspaper for the past two years. Is this worth mentioning in my personal statement at all? I like to consider my journalistic work as a kind of research-lite experience with conducting first-hand interviews, albeit not in the field I'm looking to go into at all (although I have a few articles more historical in scope). Or would mentioning this detract from my my statement's academic focus?\n\nIf this is more suited for the grad admissions sub, I'll just copy and paste over there, but I feel like this sub might have more people on the other side of the admissions process who can give me more specific advice. Thanks in advance!",

When the postdoc is complete, I’ll have 3-4 clearly articulated research areas, all of which are in-demand subfields. My job talk for the next 1-2 years is compelling, surprising, and even entertaining. By all measures, I will be competitive for TT jobs when I got on the market following the postdoc. \n\nI love what we do — the data collection, analysis, writing, grant apps, all of it is exciting to me. But I by no means identify as a careerist, or have aspirations of working at a top 25 school or lab. In addition, my wife and brother have medical issues that greatly benefit from being near family, or at least a network of people we can rely on. That would require being near our home state. I also got into this business for the freedom, not fame or prestige. It’s clear to me now that programs in R2 schools (Eg, those without a PhD program) are ideal for myself and my family. \n\n\nSo, how can I begin the multiyear process of targeting the 5-12 r2 schools that fit this description? And how can I also communicate that I genuinely want to be with them, and will not be looking to move to an R1 or more prestigious program? Again, I’m not even trying to be a big frog in a small pond. I just want to be near family and continue enjoying freedom rather than chasing status.",

Not only that, but in order to submit a proposal, you had to buy membership, which I wasn’t mad about paying because it includes subscription to a cool journal I won’t otherwise have access to because I’m not currently affiliated with a university, but also there isn’t a presenter rate for conference admission, and it’s not cheap. The whole thing feels… kinda scammy to me but I’m curious if that’s just how these things work? \n\nThere’s a grant I can apply for that will cover some of the travel costs but I’d still need a hotel etc, and there’s no guarantee I’ll get the grant. Basically I’m asking if it’s worth it for my (currently unemployed ass) to pay all these costs to present at my first conference?

They then patented a device which wakes deaf people up if the device detects breathing problems during sleep. The same team of scientists later proved this hypothesis (that hair cells are respiratory chemoreceptors) in experiments on mice, 3 years after creating the patent. After doing these experiments, they said that in humans, damage or loss of these hair cells will cause death from respiratory failure.\n\nWhat about people who are completely deaf then, such as Hellen Keller? She went completely deaf when she was a child and she lived until she was 87 years old.\n\nHow do scientists explain that? And why is any paper talking about hair cells being pivotal for breathing always authored by the same team of scientists? Why aren't other teams of scientists talking about this discovery?\n\n***According to Oxford Academic, loss of hair cells is the leading cause of hearing loss.

        "text": "Hi everyone. So, I recently graduated from my university with a History BA and my \"capstone\" (they called it a thesis at my university for some reason, but it was only 35 pages) was a comparative analysis of the economics in 2 cities in my state during the Reconstruction era. My professor said this paper was promising and that I should look into going further with it, which I would love to do, but I'm not currently able to attend grad school.\n\nIn terms of the paper itself, I know that I'd like to trim down the somewhat unnecessary details of the paper, increase the number of cities in my analysis, pull information from a wider variety of sources, etc. \n\nMy main concern is how to go through this process without being a grad student? My professor said he would be glad to provide writing assistance, but he understandably must prioritize his work at the university. I guess my two main concerns are:\n\n1. How will I get approval from archives/museums to view their sources? (My university had approval for students, which is how I was able to do my paper initially.) \n\n2. Will I even have a chance at making it through peer review as a non-grad student? If so, how do I decrease whatever negative impact may be caused by my lack of formal education?",

I am specifically looking for this in-text/full-text search functionality. I can remember specific sentences from the literature, but never which paper they came from. I am therefore looking for a citation manager that shows me the sentences in the pdf that I am looking for. Even mendeley citation manager does not do that.

One with my Ph.D. supervisor in city A, the money is not bad and I will be doing more of the same old stuff that I have done with him. He doesn't care much about training me to become anything and he never helps anyone to get a job in academia or industry. For him, we are workers in his research center and that is about it. No mentorship whatsoever. the other option is a professor who seems to be very accomplished and nice. In my interview with him, he asked me about what I want to do in the future, a question that I have never heard from my current supervisor. The problem is that this position will be in another city (city B) and I would need to leave my wife and see her once or twice a month. The payment is lower but he promised to increase it once I show my merit. The dilemma is that I was approached by a senior manager of a big industrial institution in City A and he seems to be interested in hiring me and I have already applied for the job. I'm very uncertain about what should I move forward. The industrial position is very lucrative but it is not guaranteed. The position in City B is nice and a good chance for me to become an academic but it is far from my family. Moreover, how leaving a postdoc in a few months (In case I got the industrial position) will affect my relationship with my PI (whether in city A or B)? I know that all would depend on my choice but I would appreciate your opinions.",

My projects often have short timelines and can cover topics I haven't been exposed to before. I've done this for a few years and I am okay but not great, I don't think my bosses have labelled me as a high performer or anything and my reviews have been \"very good\". I definitely suffer from work anxiety and imposter syndrome that leads to me using my time ineffectively.\n\nI want to make the next jump up in responsibility but I feel like that would lead to working longer hours or on weekends to get ahead of things. Often I am not given strict guidelines and scoping out projects is also part of my job. I also think I need to sell my contributions to leadership to really get ahead. \n\n\nHave any of you dealt with similar feelings and how did you decide to proceed?",

        "text": "I worked with a 27 year old Indian man (PhD) candidate straight from India (A) and the PI was Latino woman (B) , and I'm an African woman (C) in my early 20s for context. Everyone else in this situation is white (D). I'm still trying to figure if race was part of the issue or sexism, etc. Or if they are just booholes.\n\nBackground: During the program he would always complain about me from being late to my work ethic, every little thing. And at the same time when I would ask for help, he would blow me off. A was supposed to be my mentor. What I ended up doing for the lab was when I think about it. He just made me his assistant. I would collect the data and then use excel to create graphs with them. I also calculated specifications for the machines we were using.\n\nProblems:\n\n\\-Complained about everything I did\n\n\\-Refused to help give me a remaining graph and information for my poster, basically the whole project was just rushed at the end\n\n\\-PI basically didn't care for the whole thing\n\n\\-He only had a problem with me in the lab, he didn't bother any other of the PhD students whatsoever \n\nMain Issue:\n\n\\-He just dismissed me from the lab to analyze data at home because I didn't have transportation (during the lockdown). I wasn't in the lab for like 2 weeks, and I wasn't given any assignments.  I texted him 2x and got no response from him. I was scared he was going to use this against me again to my directors. So I  called him asking him for help with the project and what I needed to do next. He didn't pick so I left a voicemail. And to note I was agitated at this point so my tone may have shown it. But I didn't scream nor use any curse words.\n\n\\-The next day we had our weekly group meeting and he begins screaming at me and saying all sorts of things. But mostly accusing me of my speech and that if I did this to a manager I would be fired. And I shouldn't have called him. I kept on apologizing and he kept on screaming at me. He then said he deleted the voicemail. The PI stopped him and just said she doesn't know what was on that voicemail so she doesn't know the full context.\n\nI left the meeting and called one of the directors of the program crying about my treatment all summer and especially about the phone call. That I personally don't think I did anything horrible besides just calling him, and I may have been agitated but I have a witness who heard my call too.\n\nI explained to her that I think he maybe sexist or possibly racist because I've never had any problems with any co-workers whatsoever. Even in academia and me being the only POC there. She denied that it could be that even before hearing the PI and A's side of the story.\n\nThe director had a meeting with them (A,B,D) and, they all still in a sense talking about the voicemail and my tone. And that they wanted to put it all behind them. The last day I was scared A was going to hurt me if I was left alone with him. But we had a meeting in person and had an interview with the news. They were all being fake nice. They published the video and gave me credit in it.\n\nWhen I had presentation 2 days (virtual), for the first one A showed up for 30 secs literally and left. And the PI didn't show up. The director noticed too and seemed a bit sad about it. The next presentation A apparently had a doctors appointment so didn't show up and it was only the PI.  She made me put A's name on my poster btw. And to note my poster was a mess, I'm still embarrassed till today.\n\nPeople found out about it and basically agreed he was a douche. But overall nothing was done about it. \n\nAfter it all ended, I tried adding A on Linkedin to see what he would do. He rejected the invite as I expected. As for the PI, I asked her for a letter of rec which she gave me. And I followed up with her and sent her a thank you letter. She didn't respond ever again and basically I think she just flat out ignored me.\n\nComing this year, they published and left me out. They used two of my graphs with added data. I told the program about it in a survey and they flat out ignored it. I have evidence for my case and now emotional distress for 2 years now over this.\n\nI'm not sure if I should call or email the directors or try to get in contact with the journal? When I talked to other students, apparent the directors have been known to be shady. And this school is notorious for race problems too. I'm mad about this but not sure if I should just quit. Sue or contact the journal about this? I did get other opportunities but I heard being a co-author is a big deal.",

While I've worked as a Research Assistant in the past (and have published work), I've never actually been to the field due to the pandemic. As a result, this opportunity is important to me, especially as someone debating whether I want to pursue academia long-term. \n\nAt my university, the most common option for MA field work is to pair yourself with a professor who has an existing project. You travel with them to the field, complete research with them / the PhD students working with them, and essentially write a thesis as a \"mini\" portion of their overall project. I am torn between working with two professors, but of whom have expressed interest in working with me.\n\nOption A: This professor is one of the reasons I chose my current program. The research they do is within environmental anthropology with a focus on multi-species ethnography (this is the field I'm interested in). They also work in the country in southern Africa I wrote my BA thesis on / plan to continue working in. However, the prof has taken a really hands-off approach. I've been told I need to plan my own research/methodology and will be relatively left to my own devices. They'll be in the field, but doing their own thing, so I could ask questions, etc. as needed.\n\nOption B: This professor does research adjacent to what I'm interested in (it's more about migration / land disputes, but my interest in environmental anthropology is human-land relationships broadly construed). They also work in West Africa in a country I know very little about, but would theoretically be open to continuing to work in if the project went well. Although I'm much less excited about the research, this professor has made it very clear that they are looking to *mentor* their MA students. I would be paired directly with a PhD student who would serve as my director supervisor in the field, shadow the prof for a week or so, etc. While I would still have my own research project under their umbrella, it's far more structured and I'd have less freedom.\n\nIntellectually, I want to go with Option A. In terms of my academic training, comfort-level, etc., I want to go with Option B. For a student in my situation, would you recommend following a research interest or following the methodological training? And if I am to go with Option B, does it in any way lock me into the subject matter (i.e., will I have a harder time switching back to my focus on environment in Southern Africa during a potential PhD / are students in their PhD typically expected to continue their MA work)? \n\nIf it's helpful, I'm in Germany and would do a PhD somewhere in Europe (likely here, the Netherlands, or Denmark).

        "text": "This prof emailed me offering me the position I applied to a few weeks ago. But this position is a backup position and in fact, I already accepted another offer that is my priority. It's just that I haven't signed the contract yet, and I doubt it will be sent to me to sign before 2023 because winter break is coming. I am contemplating whether I should tell the above prof right away that I am not taking his offer. Or shall I say that I ask for a bit more time because I am considering other offers? Either way, I don't have a great idea of what kind of wording I should use in order not to sound that I don't appreciate the offer.\n\nPS: Honestly, this is what I hate about being in academia. I never have the heart to turn down an offer. This prof I am talking about is so nice and I can imagine that he is a really good supervisor. Senior, knowledgeable, and nice to people. I am literally freezing in words, I don't want to make him wait at the same time I am lacking creativity to tell him that his position is not what I want the most.",

I recently found a guy and after reading his paper and sending him my research interests I requested him for an opportunity to work under him.\n\nI started mailing him initially a month ago about working with him on a project, and after reminding him after a week to give his views on my request, we arranged a meeting the next day, and he agreed to find me a project. The discussion seemed to favor me getting to work on something. \n\nAfter more than a week of not hearing from him, I once again emailed him to ask about his decision, and then after 3 days, he replied that he still remembered our arrangement and would come back to me soon. It's been 3 weeks since, and I am starting to get worried about whether he has made up his mind. I assumed that, after all, he said he remembered my request, but now it's been quite a while, and now I think I should again push my luck to ask about this situation.\n\nI am not sure how to do that given the situation and be as polite as possible and not seem too pushy. Please help me in working out a way to structure an email to him for this purpose.",

Not surely what to call this entirely, in part it's a rant, in part it's a request for advice support. \n\nTo make a long story short, I am currently at the beginning of my 5th year of a 4 year PhD. Program. I was given an extension to make up for the disastrousness of 2020 and part of 2021 in which I could barely do any field research (which involved marginalized, nomadic groups of people) as well as archival fieldwork. During this entire 4 years, I have received generous funding, and I just found out after much anxiety that i will be getting partial funding for at least the first semester of next year (I would need to turn my dissertation in by September anyway) and I will have completed my final requirement to give a research seminar on my work by then. My advisor has always been kind and supportive, if very hands off, and has had a bit of of a scatterbrained attitude about him, and my committee is very much the same. I guess this is normal...anyhow this is all at the backdrop.\n\nI very recently (about 2 months ago) turned in a complete draft of my dissertation. I didn't think it would be perfect but I received the feedback last week and suffice to say my advisor thinks there is major work that needs to be done in terms of buttressing the paper with additional qualitative and archival research, as well as rewriting and heavily revising \"radical revisions\" as he puts it, parts of the dissertation. There were some other problems as well, which he blames himself for, but anyway, that's where we are now. In spite of all of the negativity, this was not really a take-down per say at all, and my advisor is 100% supportive of and says that he is dedicated to helping me finish it. He isn't dismissive and I ended the meeting on a stressed out if encouraging note. He has subsequently told me that I will need to buckle down and get a move on quickly as we are now in \"emergency mode\" but that he has my back and supports me fully in doing this--which he has stressed. He has repeatedly told me this is doable and it's a great topic, so there is that.\n\nI am quite frankly feeling a mix of emotions right now. It could be worse. I have funding, my advisor is very supportive at this stage if realistic. I am just stressed, frustrated, confused, and a bit burnt out and exhausted. I have til around September so 9 months, which I guess in theory is enough time. I do enjoy doing qualitative and archival research, I just feel I am stuck in a groundhog day and of course the clock is ticking. I am just very worn out to be honest and in need of some support/council. What do you all think?",

Should I be worried about the quality of this journal? The comments were listed as 'comments to the author' and I wonder if that means that we don't get to see the full report.

Hoping that if I don't get a good amount of responses from my original target group, these Plan B Group would reply.\n\nThere's no certainty on the responses of any group, I'm just sharing the survey with a bunch of people and asking them to re-send to their contacts that they know have the required expertise.  \n\n\nI really haven't started to write my thesis properly so I feel I could change the case study if necessary (I'll just need to invest a lot of time again on reading but oh well, better than not having data I guess), I need to turn in my thesis by the end of March.\n\nI don't know if this is okay, one of my main concerns is that because of all the changes now I will have to work around the target group that actually provides responses to write the research design part of the thesis, I really didn't do any design after the first target group change.

I currently have the possibility to have an internship at an [NSF Federally Funded R&amp;D Center](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/), however, I am also in the middle of applying to REUs. The past two summers I have done research at my primary university, and was really looking forward to doing an REU elsewhere. However, this internship also seems to be a really opportunity, and I would need to accept the offer soon. Therefore, I would either accept the internship, and be forced to stop applying to REUs, or reject the internship and hope I'll receive a position in an REU. Would anyone happen to have any input as to which option would be better for graduate school? Thank you!",

I'd like to know how soon should I (if I should at all) start calling for updates on this position because it sounds to me too good to be true.  \n\n\nThey're looking for 3 assistant professors in the same discipline, tenure-track, to potentially start in Aug 2023, the doctoral degree can be finished by the Spring of 2024, and the job has been posted already twice within a semester. The application period ended at the beginning of December and I hope to graduate in the fall of 2023.",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI hate to be that person but I have a question regarding how selection committees (whether it be at the university or national level) for prestigious scholarships (such as the Goldwater Scholarship) look at GPAs when evaluating candidates.\n\nMy specific question is: is a 3.96 GPA going to “dock” a student and eliminate them in the selection process? Obviously ceteris paribus you would choose a student with a 4.0 but I really feel that my extracurricular, work, and research experience are very strong. I’m just extremely nervous that my first B in junior year is going to cause me to miss out on some opportunities.\n\nI would appreciate thoughts on how the selectors on a committee think when evaluating applicants for these scholarship awards.",

I'm in a co-op program and I'll be starting my working term this January, but my placement doesn't start until February (and I'll be working a laboratory research job). This leaves me with over a month of free time.\n\nI figure I should use this wealth of freedom somewhat responsibly and productive or learn something that will be useful for my career. As a professional in your field, what would you learn/what skill would you develop if you had this opportunity? What else would you do in that month?",
