In order to do that, I would assume that the number of trials is equal to the number of successes.  I also assumed that P(x) &lt; 0.05. \nThus the critical value equation becomes\nP(x) = p^X\nThus, I saw that the lower the p value, the lower the number of successes need to show this.

        "author": "jay520",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/87plbk/arguments_foragainst_different_measures_of_spread/",
        "text": "So this turned out to be longer rambling than I intended. Sorry about that.\n\nThis is more of a philosophical speculative and/or research question than a specific question looking for a concrete answer. I'm looking for different justifications for different possible measures of spread (i.e. different methods of quantifying how far apart or close together a set of datapoints are) with just one quantifier (so not like a range or quartiles or anything like that). \n\nThe most popular measure of spread is the standard deviation. But I find this concept highly unintuitive. For example, we know that the standard deviation of IQ scores is 15 points. If you tell that to the average person, they probably won't know what the hell you're talking about. What does that number - *15* - signify? If you have somewhat of an education in statistics then you'll know that this means that, 15 IQ points is the square root of the mean squared difference between every person's IQ in the population and the mean IQ of the population...But to me, this isn't helpful at all. In fact, I've known what standard deviation meant for several years and I've known that the standard deviation of IQ is 15 points for several years, but I still don't have an intuitive handle on what the 15 number signifies. The same applies to standard deviations generally. I just know that if you do these calculations you get this number.\n\nI was prompted to think more deeply about this when I recently saw a video where someone tried to explain what standard deviation meant. They stated that it was a measure of the average difference between each datapoint and the mean. Obviously, this is incorrect, but then I started to wonder...*that* is probably the intuitive understanding of spread. If so, why don't we just use *this* instead of standard deviation? So I had in my head two competing measures of spread: (1) root mean squared deviation from the mean (standard deviation), and (2) mean absolute deviation from the mean. \n\nThen I did some reading and some people argued for method (1) because (aside from it being easier to calculate) both methods are concerned with deviation from the *mean*. But the mean *just is* the point of minimized squared distances from it. And so if we're using the mean as our point of focus, then we're concerned with squared distances. So we might as well be consistent and stick with method (1) over (2) so that we use squared distances all the way down (or something like that). But then I thought why ought we be concerned with the point of minimized squared deviations in the first place? Why not look at deviations from the point of minimized *absolute* distances from it (the median)? Then this allows for two other seemingly intuitive possible measures of spread: (3) root mean squared deviation from the median, and (4) mean absolute deviation from the median.\n\nBut since we're talking about medians, we can replace *mean* absolute deviations with *median* absolute deviations. This creates two more seemingly intuitive possible methods of spread: (5) median absolute deviation from the mean, and (6) median absolute deviation from the median.\n\nBut wait...Why do we even care about deviations from a particular point of focus? Don't we really just care about the differences between the points in the sample (rather than the differences between the points and some \"central\" point)? If we focus on measuring *differences*, that leaves three seemingly intuitive measures of spread: (7) root mean squared difference, (8) average absolute difference, and (9) median absolute difference. \n\nIn total, I have in my head nine possible measures of spread:\n\n1. Root mean squared deviation from the mean\n2. Mean absolute deviation from the mean\n3. Median absolute deviation from the mean\n4. Root mean squared deviation from the median\n5. Mean absolute deviation from the median\n6. Median absolute deviation from the median\n7. Root mean squared difference\n8. Mean absolute difference\n9. Median absolute difference\n\nSo I guess I have a few questions: \n\n(i) Are any of these functionally equivalent to the other? In other words, is it necessarily the case that you can derive one value from the other, and vice-versa, for any given population (I don't really feel like doing the math)?\n\n(ii) How are these measures impacted by the data differently? For example, I know that one of the differences between (1) and (2) is that (1) gives more disproportionately weight to larger differences. I'm interested in particular in how looking at *differences between points* is influenced differently than *differences between a central locus*, e.g. in how (8) will differ from (2). My intuition is that method (8) will tend to be higher than (2) (but I don't feel like doing the math to confirm/deny this).\n\n(iii) What are the arguments for/against different measures of spread? Measures (2), (5) and (8) and (9) \nseem most compelling to me in terms of raw intuitiveness, but maybe there are other mathematical advantages for other measures. For example, I know that if you have a normal distribution, and you know the root mean squared deviation from the mean (i.e. standard deviation), then you can know exactly which proportion of the population is above/below a certain multiple of the standard deviation. Are similar functions possible with other distributions and other measures of spread? \n\n(iv) How widely used (if at all) are these different measures? I know that standard deviation is definitely the most frequently used, but I've also seen mean absolute deviation from the mean used a few places as well. I'm particularly curious as to whether (7)-(9) are used professionally as I've never seen them before.",

        "text": "Hi guys, so I am currently attempting to do the statistical analysis for my 3rd year Psychology project which is looking at Authentic Self-Presentation on Facebook and how that is linked to symptoms of well-being.\n\nSo my dependent variables are levels of: Stress, Anxiety, Depression &amp; Social Support. And for my independent variables I have: How long do you use Facebook per day (In minutes) and then I also have a scores for two different types of Facebook usage (Active Facebook use &amp; Passive Facebook use) \n\nAm I right in thinking the best way to approach this would be several different multiple regressions: So looking at types of Facebook use &amp; minute usage and how that relates to anxiety levels? Then again for levels of stress? Then depression, then social support? Or is there a better way to do it? \n\nI hope this makes sense any help would be hugely appreciated. My supervisor is away on annual leave for 2 weeks so is no help to me.\n\nThanks. ",

(For example, out of 3000 hospitals, one score had 289 scores at the 5th percentile and 152 had scores at the 95th percentile). I don't know how many hospitals actually earned the exact 5th or 95th percentile scores.\n\nIf at the end of the day all the hospitals are lined up from worst score (most above the mean) to best score (most below the mean), and the mean has shifted due to winsorization, and the bottom quartile is penalized, who stands to suffer from the non-symmetrical Winsorization?\n\nThanks for any help you can provide.",

So, basically the model is trying to predict future revenues based on current salary.\n\nI have seen others use this analysis. But I simply cannot understand how this analysis makes any sense. Here is my argument:\n\nClearly, the salary of a company depends on its current and past revenue, since when a company does well, it will tend to reward its employees. Therefore, we can assume that S(t) is actually some function of R(t), R(t-1), R(t-2), and so on. Therefore, S(t) = f(R(t), R(t-1), ...) for some function f. \n\nBut, likewise, the revenue at time t+1, is obviously also some function of past revenues, or, at the very least, strongly correlated with past revenues. So let us just say R(t+1) = F( R(t), R(t-1), ...) for some function F.\n\nNow, looking at our model R(t+1) = a + bS(t), we can substitute in our F and f functions, and we get \n\nF(R(t), R(t-1)) = a + bf(R(t), R(t-1), R(t-2), ...).\n\nThis model contains NO mention of R(t+1) or S(t), and yet it is identical to the original model. It merely models revenues in terms of revenues. It seems like a completely nonsensical model (at least when it comes to saying anything about salaries and their affect on revenues).\n\nAnd yet, I have seen this model used in an influential paper? So am I just dumb and not getting why this model makes sense, or what?\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This is about stats, it is a request for help from stats-experts.\n\nI need Reddit-help polishing a letter I'm going to send to some M.D.'s, please. Unless I make this letter good, the M.D.'s will misunderstand it, and that would cost me my life.\n\nI've been very ill for 20 years, but doctors have rendered no sensible diagnosis or treatment.\n\nIn 2006, I tried an antibiotic named 'Albendazole'. Albendazole kills parasitic worms. Generally, Albendazole causes no side-effects in the brain. In cases where worm larva are in the brain, though, Albendazole kills the larva, the rupturing larva cells release a surge of toxins, and the larva's toxins maybe cause brain-swelling, and the brain-swelling causes headache, loss of consciousness, or death.\n\nSometimes a doctor diagnoses a patient with stomach-worm-infection, the doctor administers Albendazole to the patient to treat the stomach infection, and the patient gets an unexpected headache or passes out. When that happens, doctors infer that the patient has worm larva in his brain:\n\n&gt; Pre-existing [brain infection] may be uncovered in patients treated w/ albendazole for other conditions, apparent by neurological symptoms (eg, seizures, increased intracranial pressure, focal signs)....\n\nhttps://reference.medscape.com/drug/albenza-albendazole-342648#5\n\nSo I tried Albendazole in 2006, and I experienced excruciating headache, seizure, and temporary loss of conscious.\n\nI keep an open mind to alternative explanations, but I take my reaction to Albendazole as compelling evidence that I have worm larva in my brain.\n\nWe could define an Albendazole-test-for-brain-infection like this:\n\n1) Administer Albendazole to a patient;\n2) Check whether the patient gets an excruciating headache.\n3) If he gets excruciating headache, conclude he has a brain infection.\n\nAccording to research I've investigated, that test might give some false-negatives (imperfect sensitivity), but the test has maximum specificity; in other words, the test has yielded no reported false-positive results ever.\n\nSo, looked at that way, in 2006 I took a test for brain-infection, the test had never yielded a false-positive before, and the test came back positive for me.\n\nSince 2006, doctors have dismissed my theory out of hand, but never have been able to explain why. One doctor suggested, \"Maybe you just had an allergic reaction to Albendazole.\" But he hadn't researched, and I had, and Albendazole has never been reported to cause any such allergic reaction in anyone.\n\nLast December, the area around my eye became swollen and has remained swollen since. That is a common symptom of worm infection. Today I finally got in to see an eye doctor. Early on, I told him, \"I have done a lot of research into my symptoms, and I have a hypothesis as to the cause.\" He smiled and nodded, but then he went immediately back to talking about something else.\n\nThen he examined my eyes closely. Then he told me, \"I don't know why it's swollen, but it's not from an infection.\"\n\nI asked him, \"How did you rule out the possibility of a helminth (worm) infection?\"\n\nHe answered, \"I... I guess I didn't. I don't know much about worm infections.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Thanks for your honesty.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"So what's your hypothesis?\"\n\nI said, \"Worm infection, in my brain.\"\n\nHe thought some more, and he ended up taking my hypothesis very seriously. He was visibly shook as he realized I may well be correct. He said to me, \"I saw something wrong with your optic nerve, which leads directly back into your brain. I'm going to do what I can for you.\" He referred me to a brain specialist.\n\nBrain specialist will do CT or MRI, which is a more normal way to screen for brain-worms. But CT and MRI give a fair amount of false-negatives for brain-worms; I will not be surprised if the imaging finds nothing. (CT and MRI revealed nothing when tried 10 years ago for me)\n\nIf the imaging finds nothing, the doctors will be legally covered to conclude, \"There are no worms in your brain; no treatment needed.\" \n\nThat's how doctors normally bail on my case. But this eye doctor today, he didn't bullshit me about anything, I think he seriously wants to go all out for me.\n\nSo if the imaging comes back negative, I want to make my case to the doctors that they still should diagnose me with brain infection, and attempt to treat me for it. Because, when I took the 'Albendazole-test-for-brain-infection', it returned a positive result, and it is a highly-specific test with no reported history of yielding false-positives.\n\nMy post here is a bit rambly, as I'm exhausted as I write it. I want to send these doctors a letter describing the severe reaction I had to Albendazole in 2006 (I haven't told them about it yet); and the letter would argue that my severe reaction to Albendazole was overwhelming evidence that I have a brain infection. Because the test has such high specifity.\n\nI can handle most of the letter on my own. But what words should I use to try to convince the doctors to interpret my reaction to Albendazole as strong evidence of a brain infection?\n\nIf any readers have doubts about my reasoning, please look at it this way: If I infected myself with a relatively harmless 2nd kind of worm that stays in the stomach and is straightforward to diagnose, doctors would diagnose the 2nd worm-infection easily, and the doctors would prescribe me Albendazole for the the 2nd infection. I'd take the Albendazole, and once again I'd get a headache and pass out. At that point, the doctors would follow this protocol that I mentioned near the beginning:\n\n&gt; Pre-existing [brain infection] may be uncovered in patients treated w/ albendazole for other conditions, apparent by neurological symptoms (eg, seizures, increased intracranial pressure, focal signs); promptly treat w/ corticosteroid &amp; anticonvulsant therapy.\n\nhttps://reference.medscape.com/drug/albenza-albendazole-342648#5\n\nThat 3-drug combo is my only shot. But I don't want to self-infect myself with a stomach-worm in order to get what I need. I don't want to do that at all. I want to write a clear letter to my doctors to help them appreciate the significance of my past with Albendazole.\n\nSorry this was so long.",

Those possibilities are...\n\n* winning on move 4\n* winning on move 5\n* winning on move 6\n\nThe 2 methods yield different likelihoods of victory.\n\n\nThe data is as follows:\n\n**Method 1**\n\n* 1/3 chance of winning on move 4\n* ~~2/3 chance of winning on move 5~~ (oops) 50% chance of winning on move 5\n* 100% chance of winning on move 6\n\n**Method 2**\n\n* 0% chance of winning on move 4\n\n(Move 4 has a 50% chance to make move 5 a 100% chance of winning and a 50% to make move 5 a 50% chance of winning.

In the study the researchers use 2 factors with 2 levels each: Factor 1 - gain/ loss; Factor 2 - physical consequences/ social consequences. They've made 4 ads - each one a combination of the two factors (Physical gain, Physical loss, Social gain, Social loss) and showed the ads to different subjects.\n\nI'm trying to figure out a procedure the authors made in the study (2 x 2 between-subjects factorial design). In their Confound check (are the ads realistic, relatable, informative and understandable - combined into an index) they compare the respondents' answers in the 4 conditions (Physical gain, Physical loss, Social gain, Social loss) using 1-way ANOVA. My question is why aren't they using 2-way ANOVA since there are two IVs (Factor 1 &amp; Factor 2). For other DVs (such as attitudes, intentions, etc) they use 2-way ANOVA. How is the confound check different?\n\nThanks in advance!",

PDF WARNING.\n\nObviously, this means I have to collect data for their model as well. In a typical nested test, you are looking at the same individuals in slightly different models. When testing non-nested models, do the same participants have to complete data for both models? I'm concerned about the length of the survey in that case. I'm worried it will negatively impact data quality. \n\nIn Vuong's paper, this would qualify as definition 3 (page 320) as it is an overlapping model (some explanatory variables are the same). I'm trying to keep the survey as short as possible, so it would be ideal if half of my sample had questions related to model 1 and half to model 2. But I'm not sure if that would violate any assumptions of this approach to model selection. Thoughts? I'm discussing with my advisor on Friday. I just wanted to check here and see if anyone had any good references they might suggest that have used this technique.
