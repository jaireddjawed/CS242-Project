Whenever I watch it, I just get this wave of pure beauty and emotional maturity wash over me in a way that other shows just don’t do for me. It’s similar to childhood nostalgia, but it’s not quite even that. I was banned from watching it as a kid, and only really got into the series when I was 16. There’s just something about the pretty colors, the animation style, the songs, that really scratches this itch that’s always in the back of my brain. Something about it triggers a really intense wish wash of emotions in me every time I watch it. Almost like I’m jumping on clouds that rain out all of my past traumas/insecurities. It’s super hard to explain, and it’s a complex emotion I have literally never felt before by anything else.",

I think they have panties as well.\n\nIt was basically plaid pants with a colored elastic Joe boxer waist band. Then the camisole was a solid color with a contrasting color edge that matched the colors in the pants. I remember a pink camisole with blue trim with pink/blue plaid pants and I think there was a blue cami with green trim and blue/green pants. \n\nMy friends and I wore these sets all the time and they were so cool. \n\nThis was just before they started doing much lower quality basic pajamas that were sold in every TJ Maxx and Costco. These were sold at Nordstrom and were super cool.\n\nPosting here to see if anyone else remembers these and if you have a picture!",
