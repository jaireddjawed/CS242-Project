Rebecca Skloot writes about Henrietta Lacks’ upbringing by saying, “Any cousins who’d stayed behind in Clover knew a wagon ride into South Boston meant treats for everyone—a hunk of cheese, maybe, or a slab of bologna—so they waited for hours on Main Street to follow the wagon to the home-house” (Skloot, 21). Though not as extreme as Henrietta’s situation, Joe’s family is similar because they reserve birthdays as the only time they get to treat themselves to eating out as a family. This is considerably different from my family; we eat out at least once a week. Also, Joe’s family does not have new, matching, and pristine furniture. But it doesn't matter the quality of furniture and it doesn’t matter how often they eat out, what does matter is that Joe's parents are able to provide for their family.\n\n\n\nFor context, this paragraph must be in 1st person, and 8 sentences exactly.",
