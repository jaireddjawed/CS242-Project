        "text": "The CPA brings together the training entitlements included in two existing accounts and a new account also launched on 1 January:  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\nThe Personal Training Account (CPF) enables people aged 16 or over to acquire rights to training that will be included in an account that will remain valid throughout their career, even if they change employer. Every year this account will be credited automatically with hours, based on the declarations made by the employer. For a full-time employee, the account will be credited with 24 hours a year up to 120 hours, then with 12 hours a year up to a maximum of 150 hours. This account will be extended to all workers, including the self-employed and civil servants, in January 2018.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\nThe Personal Hardship Account (C3P) enables a worker exposed to arduous conditions, beyond certain thresholds, to set up an account and accumulate points in it. Each year four points will be credited if he/she is exposed to a single risk factor, while workers born before July 1956 and exposed to several risks will receive up to 16 points. The points can be converted into training entitlements to enable the person to retrain for a job with less arduous conditions.\n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nThe Citizen Engagement Account, also created on 1 January 2017, enables people involved in volunteer work to acquire training entitlements. They may be members of the ‘military reserve’, relaunched after the 2016 attacks to provide backup for law enforcement, or they may be employees who look after a young trainee. This account will enable the holders to acquire up to 60 hours of training, which will be financed by the legal entities responsible for the volunteer activity concerned.\n\nA person’s entitlements in their CPA are acquired throughout their career and do not expire. They may be consulted online. Only the person who holds these training entitlements can decide how to use them. An employer can ask him/her to use them for specific training but cannot force him/her to agree to it, and refusal to do so cannot be penalised.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n(Google translate works well enough for the sites mentioned)\n\nhttps://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072050&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000033010090&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id\n\n**http://www.gouvernement.fr/compte-personnel-activite-cpa**\n\nhttp://tnova.fr/notes/quel-avenir-pour-le-cpa-dans-les-5-ans-a-venir\n\nhttp://www.gouvernement.fr/en/for-a-more-robust-social-europe-with-the-european-pillar-of-social-rights\n\n",

It will be in italics.*\n\nThe source is the *New York Times* story [\"Trump Team Met With Lawyer Linked to Kremlin During Campaign.\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html) This story was also independently confirmed by [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-jr-jared-kushner-met-russian-lawyer/story?id=48525401)\n\nSome details:\n\n- The meeting took place at Trump Tower.\n\n- The meeting was confirmed by representatives of Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner.\n\n- The lawyer they met with:\n\n&gt;The Russian lawyer invited to the Trump Tower meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is best known for mounting a multipronged attack against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law so enraged Mr. Putin that he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children.\n\n- The lawyer's ties:\n\n&gt;Ms. Veselnitskaya was formerly married to a former deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region, and her clients include state-owned businesses and a senior government official’s son, whose company was under investigation in the United States at the time of the meeting. Her activities and associations had previously drawn the attention of the F.B.I., according to a former senior law enforcement official.\n\n- The topic of discussion:\n\n&gt;In his statement, Donald Trump Jr. said: 'It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.' He added: 'I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.'”\n \n- The nature of the meeting's disclosure: \n\n&gt;The Trump Tower meeting was not disclosed to government officials until recently, when Mr. Kushner, who is also a senior White House aide, filed a revised version of a form required to obtain a security clearance.\" \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Is there any precedent for such a meeting? Are there any indications that this meeting is usual or unusual?\n\n2) Does the meeting violate any law?\n\n3) *Does the new revelation about the possible motivation for the meeting impact its legality?*",

[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election) It is important to note this is not something that can be done to US Senate/Representatives as it is not supported by the constitution. [[3]](https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/ee067ba0-db71-4394-9a37-453316aeb453.pdf)\n\n&gt; As to removal by recall, the United States Constitution does not provide for nor authorize the\nrecall of United States officers such as Senators, Representatives, or the President or Vice\nPresident, and thus no Member of Congress has ever been recalled in the history of the United\nStates. The recall of Members was considered during the time of the drafting of the federal\nConstitution in 1787, but no such provisions were included in the final version sent to the states\nfor ratification, and the specific drafting and ratifying debates indicate an express understanding\nof the framers and ratifiers that no right or power to recall a Senator or Representative in\nCongress exists under the Constitution.\n\nJust recently, the California Democratic Party filed suit against three students of CSU-F claiming that they misrepresented details about what would happen should the recall occur when getting people to sign.[[4]](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=9389)[[3]](http://www.dailywire.com/news/18343/california-democratic-party-sues-conservative-peter-van-voorhis#).

[[6]](http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article158942474.html) The signatures required were 20,000 which was far exceeded by the 80k+ signatures garnered; however, that same day the governor changed the rules for this in response essentially making the recall date effective the same time as legislative primary election where voter turnout is highest. [[7]](http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article155744799.html)\n\nHere is a timeline of the recall as well as legal information relevant to the state of California for the recall process. [[8]](https://ballotpedia.org/Josh_Newman_recall,_California_State_Senate_(2017))\n\nWhat merit does this law-suit have? Have there been others like it?",

        "text": "So in this whole Russia election hacking story, I know of two \"hacks\": that resulted in the release of information - Podesta's emails and the DNC server.\n\n\nI have no clue about electronic internet forensics but I do know that news is like an iceberg...we only see the tip, and it likely looks different from various angles.\n\nAfter the president's recent comments about \"it could be Russia, it could be others...we don't know\" I started digging a little further as it appears that all the reporting has been that it was most certainly Russia.\n\n\nIn trying to understand more I came across at least two articles related to the DNC hack which clearly state that the DNC has never allowed any outside intelligence or investigative body access to their servers -\n\n\nFrom January - http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/fbi-russia-hacking-dnc-crowdstrike/index.html\n\n\nJust recently - http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/5/dnc-email-server-most-wanted-evidence-for-russia-i/\n\n\nIs there any other corroborating evidence that can be gathered outside of the server that substantiates the claims of this private company?\n\n\nIs there evidence that this private company can provide that could not possibly be faked or misleading that investigators can use to make their determinations?\n\n\nIn regards to the Podesta emails - I have seen no stories regarding NSA, CIA, or FBI investigators reviewing the information, but I am also aware that they would most likely not comment on ongoing investigations. I did however find articles stating that \"private cyber security\" firms confirm that the Russians were the source of the phishing scam\n\nHere's one - http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/politics/phishing-email-hack-john-podesta-hillary-clinton-wikileaks/index.html\n\n\nAnd another - https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/private-security-group-says-russia-was-behind-john-podestas-email-hack.html\n\nSame questions apply. \n\n \nLastly, were there attempted hacks of any republicans or the RNC that did not get the same amount of press coverage because they were unsuccessful?",

They tend to advocate for new policies that tax/ban polluters and grant subsidies for green companies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Would the reduction of 'non-green' subsidies accomplish both goals of reducing government intervention in the economy and bettering environmental goals like reducing CO2 emissions?*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome examples:\n\n**Agricultural Tax Exemption**: Methane from cows account for 39% of global CO2 emissions. At the same time, many states will greatly cut down property taxes if you have cattle on your property.\n\n[Texas](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/ag-timber/)\n\n[Florida](http://www.freshfromflorida.com/Divisions-Offices/Marketing-and-Development/Agriculture-Industry/Business-Development-Resources/Agricultural-Property-Tax-Classification)\n\nThe IRS will deduct fuel consumed for farming purposes: https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/10-things-to-know-about-farm-income-and-deductions\n\nFurthermore, the meatpacking industry (ex: Tyson Foods) has many subsidies lined up through the federal government (Cato Institute estimates $30 billion). Cheaper meat encourages more consumption and more cows.\nhttps://www.perc.org/articles/big-meat-and-big-government\n\n**Gas Price Subsidies**: The US government spends an estimated $4 billion per year assisting American oil companies. Cheaper gas means more people are likely to buy and use more gas and cars that run on gas.\n\n[$4 billion, NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/upshot/do-oil-companies-really-need-4-billion-per-year-of-taxpayers-money.html)\n\n[Fossil Fuel Subsidies, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/12/us-taxpayers-subsidising-worlds-biggest-fossil-fuel-companies)\n\n**Car Manufacturer Subsidies**: The US government bailed out the American car manufacturers with $80 billion during the Great Recession. Cheaper cars make it more affordable to burn gas and release CO2.\n\nhttps://www.thebalance.com/g00/auto-industry-bailout-gm-ford-chrysler-3305670",
