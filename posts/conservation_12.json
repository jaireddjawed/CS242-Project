I want to set up a business for two reasons:\n1. To do something useful with my skills\n2. Be able to do it from anywhere and not be tied to a company I have to commute to\n\nI don't need to earn a large salary, if I did I'd stay in what I currently am... A large fintech company. \n\nIdeally I'd work in conservation and/or ecology building useful apps. I've found a few things so far that work but are awful to use. Replacing them wouldn't pay the bills though so I thought I'd ask the community... Is there something you think is really needed? Do a lot of people need it? Would a very low price subscription model work? Could it be part of a suite of apps? \n\nMany thanks\n",

        "text": "I graduated college last year in '17. I got my Bachelor's in Biology. I took a few classes that were more focused on conservation, ecology, and animal behavior. Those were the ones I enjoyed the most. \nI also got to take part in a short class that focused on prairie restoration, and was able to participate in a controlled burn on the prairie. But aside from my classes I don't have any other experience in the field. I also got to lead some tours around the prairie I helped work on. And by far educating others, especially young kids was great. Seeing them understand the importance of all the work put in was amazing. I'm currently working in an office job, and while it's not terrible it's no where near what I want to be doing. \nSo, as someone that has little experience outside of my classes due to lack of motivation on my part during college, what can I do now that will help me get a job in conservation. I really enjoyed working on the prairie and doing whatever I could to help restore the prairie. Ideally I would want to do something like that, work in a zoo, a state/national park, or just help educate people on the subject again. Do you guys have any advice for someone in my position? I have been applying to various positions I would I enjoy, but not hearing back is a little disheartening.",

There's a small pilgrimage town inside the sanctuary, containing numerous species of birds, and maybe an elephant or two (I only saw one).\n\nNara, Japan. This city is well known for the friendly deers. The area nearby Nara park is where sika deers lives harmoniously assimilated with humans, and you are free to feed and pet them.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to raise awareness on our rapidly shrinking wildlife population, thus information on critically endangered animals are highly appreciated (eg: chinese pangolins, south china tigers). If there is enough data recieved, we could push this research into a filmed documentary. That is all, your comments and contributions are highly appreciated. Thank you very much.\n\nFaris",

        "text": "Hi /r/conservation,\n\nWhat can a Python programmer do to become an asset to conservation organizations as a potential employee?\n\nI'm working on immigrating to Toronto from the US and am in the climax of a months- (even years-) long crisis in which I'm feeling obsessed with the question of *why* I'm doing what I'm doing. My heart is simply not in tech for the sake of tech, and the more I learn the worse it gets, and the more ridiculous, albeit incredible, technology begins to feel to me. What my heart *is* in is being connected to the natural world and fighting the (seemingly losing) battle to protect it from destruction. However, I'm content with digging into using technology for the purpose of helping the natural world, which seems like a niche I need to dig into based on job prospects.\n\nI'm considering returning to school after I immigrate and studying Environmental Science, with some effective minor. Given my technical aptitude, and my passion for protecting nature, what can I do to really be an asset in the conservation movement, if anything? I'm intensely ambitious and want to be able to add something that's needed rather than what there's already an abundance of, in terms of the applicant pool. I'm thinking about looking for projects in GIS or other useful tools studying nature data and I'm trying to find volunteer opportunities to help out and hopefully have the chance to learn field skills-- and/or are there projects I can undertake myself to learn to collect and analyze my own wildlife data following the correct practices and protocols? If there are some favored books on the subject I'd love a recommendation.\n\nThank you for reading, I'd be happy to clarify and explain anything needed.\n\nSome details:\n\n\\- I'm 28\n\n\\- I live in Phoenix, AZ\n\n\\- My current programming experience deals with reading laboratory data, generating reports, Flask web apps, DBs/SQL, some Windows server administration, and I'm a one-person team so I can work effectively in contexts where I may lack the support of a whole department (which I could picture being a factor).\n\n\\- I'm as despairing as they come-- I'm not starry-eyed in need of a dose of reality. It's more like I'm hail-marying the rest of my life because it feels so much like the inferno is coming, and I'll be dead before I know it, so I may as well make some useful go of it and spare other things from as much suffering as I can help. Anything is better than complacency.  \n\n\nedit: poor wording",
