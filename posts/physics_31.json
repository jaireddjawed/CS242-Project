I've been interested in physics and science pretty much ever since, especially astrophysics I guess, I'm doing astrophotography as a hobby.\n\nI learned small chucks every now and then, nothing too complicated for sure, and I'm thinking of perhaps learning it more deeply.\n\nI'm currently working as a software engineer, and really love my job so I don't plan on changing that any time soon, so I'm wondering whether I'd like to actually do a degree in physics, or just learn it by myself(I love learning by myself, that's how I learned pretty much everything, including my profession).\n\nI personally don't feel the need for a degree, I just want to learn it because it interests me, but I don't think I'll have any use for that paper in the future. That way I can also focus on subjects that are more interesting to me, obviously I'll need to learn some basics too which might not be as interesting necessarily, but that's part of it.\n\nSo I came here to hear suggestions mostly. Can you learn physics outside of university? What might be the best source for that? Are there courses with a nice syllabus? Or should I just find a source for each subject?\n\nThanks :)",

Obviously, there are difficulties in resolving general relativity (curved spacetime)  with quantum physics (flat spacetime). Perhaps it is possible to place general relativity within a larger local framework. \n\nWhat if instead of a “Big Bang”, it is instead a collision of two larger, but non infinite, uniform universes; Our observable universe is something like a minimal-energy soap bubble between the two wavefronts? I will try answer some questions from Wikipedia as to how it would be a different interpretation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuantum gravity\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2)\\]\n\n[Quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity): Can [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) be realized as a fully consistent theory (perhaps as a [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory))?[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-6) Is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete? Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton), or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in [loop quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity))? Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity mechanism?\n\nOne of the branes may be continuous, say containing waves, and the other brane may be discrete, say containing particles. They can each be assumed to have a different and constant initial energy state. Thus, when the two branes collide, the energy in the reaction is the difference between the energy levels in the two branes, rather than between one big bang bang and the theoretical vacuum energy (this may account for the discrepancy between the )\n\n[Vacuum catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant_problem): Why does the predicted mass of the [quantum vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_state) have little effect on the expansion of the universe?\n\nCosmological constant problem - The true quantum vacuum (very large value ZPE) is outside of both of the branes. The small value of the experimentally observed cosmological constant (within the “blue circle”) is due to the difference in energy levels between the two branes. Everywhere we look is within the universe/the “blue circle”, so we will not observe the true quantum vacuum value (which occurs outside the branes).\n\n[Black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole), [black hole information paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox), and [black hole radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_radiation): Do black holes produce thermal radiation, as expected on theoretical grounds?[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-:2-8) Does this radiation contain information about their inner structure, as suggested by [gauge–gravity duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge%E2%80%93gravity_duality), or not, as implied by [Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation)'s original calculation? If not, and black holes can evaporate away, what happens to the information stored in them (since quantum mechanics does not provide for the destruction of information)? Or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants? Is there another way to probe their internal structure somehow, if such a structure [even exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_hair_theorem)?\n\nThe singularity within a black hole may not actually exist. Instead, matter slips through the centre of the black hole by the uncertainty principle and gets “written” onto one or the other brane. The branes are linked by it being a point frozen in time. In this way information is preserved. \n\nThe [cosmic censorship hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_censorship_hypothesis) and the [chronology protection conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_protection_conjecture): Can singularities not hidden behind an event horizon, known as \"[naked singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_singularities)\", arise from realistic initial conditions, or is it possible to prove some version of the \"cosmic censorship hypothesis\" of [Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose) which proposes that this is impossible?[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-9) Similarly, will the [closed timelike curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve) which arise in some solutions to the equations of general relativity (and which imply the possibility of backwards [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel)) be ruled out by a theory of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity) which unites general relativity with quantum mechanics, as suggested by the \"chronology protection conjecture\" of [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking)?\n\nEventually, information is sorted onto the two different branes and they do not interact, so cosmic censorship is preserved. \n\nQuantum physics\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3)\\]\n\n[Yang–Mills theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory): Given an arbitrary [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space) [gauge group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_symmetry), does a non-trivial quantum Yang–Mills theory with a finite [mass gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_gap) exist? (This problem is also listed as one of the [Millennium Prize Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems) in mathematics.)[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-10)\n\n[Quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory): Is it possible to construct, in the mathematically rigorous framework of [algebraic QFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_quantum_field_theory), a theory in 4-dimensional spacetime that includes interactions and does not resort to [perturbative methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics))?\n\nYes. Each brane has its own individual algebra. The interactions between the branes are mediated by gravity. Quantum effects appear because there is statistically random “flicker” between the two branes. Within each independent brane, the usual QFT theory works.   \n\nCosmology and general relativity\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4)\\]\n\n[Axis of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil_(cosmology)): Some large features of the microwave sky at distances of over 13 billion light years appear to be aligned with both the motion and orientation of the solar system. Is this due to systematic errors in processing, contamination of results by local effects, or an unexplained violation of the [Copernican principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle)?\n\nThese large features (i.e., [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan\\_Great\\_Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Great_Wall)) are an impact residue of the two branes. These features are too large for gravity to form, in the given time frame. It should be possible to derive the shape of the brane wavefronts from these features. \n\n[Fine-tuned universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_universe): The values of the fundamental physical constants are in a narrow range necessary to support carbon-based life.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-13)[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-:1-14)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-15) Is this because there exist [other universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse) with different constants, or are our universe's constants the result of chance, or some other factor or process? (See also the [Anthropic Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle).)\n\nWhen two almost circular wavefronts collide and overlap, the interior angles of the 2 intersection points vary. If the parameters of the “blue circle” universe are a function of these interior angles, by the central limit theorem, it should test across all values between the energy levels of the two branes. Therefore fine-tuned parameters for a universe are somewhat inevitable, given a big enough energy differential between the two branes.   \n\n[Problem of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_time): In quantum mechanics, time is a classical background parameter and the flow of time is universal and absolute. In general relativity time is one component of [four-dimensional spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_spacetime), and the flow of time changes depending on the curvature of spacetime and the spacetime trajectory of the observer. How can these two concepts of time be reconciled?\n\nFor the infinitely big universe containing all branes, time is an absolute background parameter. Within the “blue circle”, relativity is applicable. It is possible that gravity is a “glue” transferring information across branes. When one brane has passed through the other, gravity ceases to act, or it acts at a different strength (relative to the vacuum energy of the brane, not the true vacuum).   \n\n[Cosmic inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation): Is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct, and, if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical [inflaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflaton) [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field) that gave rise to this cosmic inflation? If inflation happened at one point, is it [self-sustaining through inflation of quantum-mechanical fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaotic_inflation), and thus ongoing in some extremely distant place?\n\nWell, probably not. The scalar field is the difference in energy between the two branes. Quantum mechanical fluctuations occur because there is “flicker” between the two different branes. \n\n[Horizon problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem): Why is the distant universe so homogeneous when the [Big Bang theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_theory) seems to predict larger measurable [anisotropies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy) of the night sky than those observed? Cosmological [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) is generally accepted as the solution, but are other possible explanations such as a [variable speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_speed_of_light) more appropriate?\n\nWhen two approximately circular wavefronts collide (and then overlap), the limit at the x axis is almost vertical for each and then tails off. Therefore one would expect an almost infinitely fast initial expansion. The precise shape of the brane wavefronts should be derivable from the inflation data. The scalar field is the difference in energy between the two branes. Therefore one would expect homogeneity since the energy squeezing from the initial impact and consequent  inflation of the “blue circle” occurs so quickly. \n\n[Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_is_there_something_rather_than_nothing%3F) and [future of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe): [How did the conditions for anything to exist arise?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Pre%E2%80%93Big_Bang_cosmology) Is the universe heading towards a [Big Freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Freeze), a [Big Rip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip), a [Big Crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch), or a [Big Bounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bounce)? Or is it part of an infinitely recurring [cyclic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model)?\n\nThe Big Bang &amp; Inflation theories are just an approximation, starting from the initial contact point of the two branes. They don’t explain why the Big Bang occurred, or why Inflation occurred at the rate it did, or why there are two different metrics for GR and QM, or why there are great discrepancies between experimentally observed and theoretical Zero Point Energy, or why some structures in the universe are far larger than gravity could yet create, or why values are so fine-tuned. This theory keeps the approximations while putting it on a deeper footing.     \nIf the branes keep moving in their same directions, the “blue circle” will keep expanding and therefore cool down.  If they move through each other, eventually they will diffuse to have a pure-state constant energy again.  The \"minimal energy soap bubble\" nature of our \"blue circle\" universe explains why we have entropy and an apparent direction in time. \n\n[Size of universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe#Size_and_regions): The diameter of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) is about 93 billion light-years, but what is the size of the whole universe?\n\nProbably infinite. \n\n[Baryon asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry): Why is there far more [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) than [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter) in the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe)? (This may be solved due to the apparent asymmetry in neutrino-antineutrino oscillations.)\n\nEnergy differentials between the two branes. \n\n[Cosmological principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle): Is the universe homogeneous and isotropic at large enough scales, as claimed by the [cosmological principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle) and assumed by all models that use the [Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric), including the current version of the [ΛCDM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model), or is the universe [inhomogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhomogeneous_cosmology) or anisotropic?[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-Snowmass21-20) Is the [CMB dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_dipole) purely kinematic, or does it signal anisotropy of the universe, resulting in the breakdown of the FLRW metric and the cosmological principle?[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-Snowmass21-20) Is the [Hubble tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_tension) evidence that the cosmological principle is false?[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-Snowmass21-20) Even if the cosmological principle is correct, is the [Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric) the right metric to use for our universe?[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-FLRW_breakdown-21)[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#cite_note-Snowmass21-20) Are the observations usually interpreted as the [accelerating expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe) rightly interpreted, or are they instead evidence that the [cosmological principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle) is false?\n\nProbably yes, considered on a scale far larger than that of two branes. The overall universe is far larger than even the two branes aforementioned. \n\n[Copernican principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle): Are cosmological observations made from Earth representative of observations from the average position in the universe?\n\nNo, as explained above. We are within the energy field of two interacting branes with different energy levels. There is no guarantee of the energy levels of the average brane. However, if the expansion rates of “blue circles”  is indeed a function of the interior angle of the collision, then perhaps similar universes to ours are very common.  \n\n[Cosmological constant problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant_problem#Cosmological_constant_problem): Why does the [zero-point energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy) of the [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum) not cause a large [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant)?

It is cancelled because we are within the energy shell of two branes at the same time. Therefore experimental evidence will depart from the theoretical minima. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gua9zeby7k8a1.jpg?width=2737&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92c68f8362111f5b2fb5114172916f12e50e595f",

The friction is negligible for both an adult and a child, the air resistance is bigger for an adult than for a child, therefore one would think the child would accelerate faster downhill? \nWhy isn't this the case?

        "text": "Normally I don't bother engaging with speculative theories, but I couldn't resist after seeing this topic on my feed for the second time.\n\nMelvin Vopson from the University of Portsmouth has proposed that (as I understand it) information has mass-energy, and elementary particles hold information. In the paper [Experimental protocol for testing the mass–energy–information equivalence principle](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0087175), he proposes an experimental test for the validity of the theory, involving an electron-positron annihilation; he says that his theory predicts the appearance of 2 additional infrared photons, in addition to the 2 which we usually see. After Eq. (9), Vopson writes:\n&gt; The energy conservation ensures again that two gamma photons of about 511 keV are produced. However, if particles store information, upon annihilation (i.e., erasure), the information content must also be conserved by producing two information energy photons ν^+ and ν^(−).\n\nMy question: it appears to me that conservation of energy and momentum alone would only necessitate the appearance of 2 photons with slightly higher energy. So implicit in the above quote is some kind of principle of conservation of \"information-energy\" and \"information-momentum\", separate from usual energy and momentum? In that case, looking for these extra infrared photons would really be testing a stronger hypothesis than just the idea that \"information has mass-energy\", right?\n\nNote: I want to focus the discussion on the scientific soundness of the proposed experimental test. The fact that this paper was published in a peer-reviewed journal indicates to me that there is surely some merit to the proposal (though I don't know how AIP Advances is viewed in the community).\n\nThe present situation seems particularly insidious to me because Vopson is marketing this theory in relation to dark matter candidates and the simulation hypothesis, and has even started a crowdfunding campaign for setting up this exact experiment (I will not link to these, but they are easy to find). I wonder if the experiment actually goes through and finds nothing he could wiggle his way out of it and say \"oh, we really should have been looking for 2 photons with slightly higher energy instead\", or something similar.",

We feel that the person's theories are distant from reality and what we consider to be \"facts\". Our thought processes and perception are conditioned by our contemporary surroundings and our social circle. In the modern day, people (well, most of them) believe in science and \"facts\". On further contemplation, I realized that what we so firmly believe may turn out to be hokum. For example, when Galileo proposed the heliocentric theory, he was condemned and deemed a heretic by the Catholic Church. The basic knowledge of the Earth revolving around the Sun was humorous to Galileo's contemporary Catholics. The Catholics ( and almost everybody ) believed that the word of God was the ultimate source of knowledge and everything else was insignificant, their belief in God was perhaps of the same magnitude (or more) as our firm belief in Science. Are the \"facts\" that we so firmly believe in the Reality? This of course puts everything we know into question. I'm not sure how credible this is. I do wonder what humanity's reaction would be if every piece of knowledge that we believe in right now were to be disproved. \nI would love to hear everyone's opinion!\nCheers!",

Can anyone tell me any related documentaries so that i can watch again.",

        "text": "I know what you're going to say, it's the bending of space-time, but hear me out first. My entire life I've been fascinated by gravity and simultaneously annoyed by it. It's one of the most pervasive forces in the universe but we have no real understanding of what it is and why it is. Sure we have theories and we know its characteristics. It's the bending of space-time caused by mass and energy and the more mass something has the more gravity it has, but that is nothing. We still don't have a real cause, and real mechanism for it. The graviton is floated as a possible culprit, but we have no way to detect it or test it. And as for discoveries leading to an answer, I haven't heard of any. We're finally able to detect gravity waves, that's amazing, but it doesn't help the quest to understand it the same way we understand protons and electrons, electricity and magnetism. All the work is just theoretical and math. I haven't heard of any experiments or plans for experiments, or even ideas for potential experiments we could do in a 100 years. When will we understand gravity? When in future history will we finally crack it? How will we do it? Surely someone must have an idea or a theory that isn't considered fringe science like superconductive gravity shielding or something. Are we really so lost and far away from an answer, a testable answer?",

        "text": "I mean specifically. How *Exactly* do they work?\n\nI understand that thermal cameras use a different sensor than traditional cameras, and that they measure the infrared light to determine the heat of an object. I also understand that all atoms release some amount of light based on their energy state.\n\nWhere I get confused is this: What exactly are the cameras measuring to determine the heat? Does it scan for a specific wavelength and uses its intensity to find the heat? Or does it operate within a specific wavelength range? If so, how does it use that information? I thought every element emits a different spectrum when excited, how does the camera work around that?\n\nI've been so confused about this for so long. Every time I try to look up the specifics, I'm directed to the same generic dumbed-down explanation on the basics -- not the nitty-gritty that I'm curious about. If you have any knowledge on this topic, please share it.",

I look at experiments/ideas ranging from Foucault pendulum, determination of speed of light, the Van degraff generator up to the modern day smartphone camera sensor or 3-D printer and I tell myself \"Man, I don't think I would have come up with an experiment or technology like this\".\n\nMy question is mostly directed towards experimentalists/applied physicists. How on earth do you come up with such a machinery/setup which looks extremely complicated but works beautifully in unision? How do you build the intuition or creativity to do experimental physics?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegards",
