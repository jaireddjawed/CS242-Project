While breasts can be a lot less taboo and likely less stimulating, the evolutionary history may point towards a sexual attraction function while other body parts are not nearly as closely linked.\n\nBreasts I could see being as sexualized as hair and legs drive some, but I would be curious to see the end data on such to see if there is any instinct involved with perception. When all is said and done and everyone is naked, still will the breast and butt be more closely related to sexual desires, similarly the male penis? If so, would not this make some people uncomfortable, particularly should they be very good looking in such areas that do elicit an instinctual response, such as an erection? Without a complete change in how we view and go about sex I don't see such instinctual responses not being uncomfortable for some party... one could gracefully excuse themselves, but having to excuse shows the uncomfortableness.\n\nOther parts of the body can be sexualized; and while I don't think they should be covered, having certain body parts covered that would show one's instinctual sexual response saves oneself from having to excuse oneself, the uncomfortableness is avoided. So perhaps breasts would be just fine to display openly should the uncomfortableness of seeing an instinctual sexual response be mitigated by the wearing of pants, as long as culturally they become less taboo so other types of responses that are inappropriate are decreased as in Panama and elsewhere. This is until drastic cultural change regarding our perception and relationship with sex that could mitigate the uncomfortableness in another way, see Brave New World by Huxely (1932) for an illustration of such a possible change.\n\n**Reference**\n\nJahme, C.

I am now living with my parents, and there aren't many work opportunities nearby that match her preferences, with most requiring a 40-mile commute or more. I'd like her to apply to a few local job listings, but I never talk to her about it or help her with her real applications; I only help her with minor computer issues.\n\nShe has a Masters and a PHD in Sociology and used to teach at the local university until her department was defunded. I ask whether it is unethical because she is not a native English speaker, despite her strong language proficiency. She also has difficulty using the computer and surfing the internet. I don't know what her genuine career prospects are, but there are a couple positions that she would absolutely enjoy and is more than qualified for. I don't think she'd want to talk to me about it or seek my advice, even though Dad isn't as helpful as he used to be and can be rude when bothered.\n\nOf course, I could leave it alone, but I've been seeing her apply weekend after weekend for a long time, and I absolutely think I could help her with the applications, which are sometimes difficult for her. It could be sensitive, and I don't believe she particularly wants my assistance. She's happy where she is, so we're fortunate. Dad also works at university so financially we are fine",

        "text": "Something I've tried really hard to understand lately is how some people end up fragile through difficult experiences, and some people end up more hardened...or if that's even the right way to think about it.\n\nI encounter people, particularly younger people, who that the modern sensitivity approach to their issues is valid. They need safe spaces, trigger warnings, or mostly just in general for people to understand how their trauma and PTSD and whatever other issues they may have is borne from harsh life experiences, and that it is simply considerate to watch what you say around them, or understand that it is valid for them to not be able to, for example, watch a comedy show that bothers them because of it's content.\n\nI also encounter people, and they tend to more be my age or older, who also have had difficult lives and life experiences, but it seems to have shaped them differently. They're tougher, in the sense that smaller things fall by the wayside, and get their relative volume turned down. A comedy show is mostly just fun and perhaps a relief of entertainment, and of course they can handle a few dark jokes about their issues, or even find relief in it.\n\nThese things sometimes come directly to clash for me. An example is an argument I had with someone about what I perceived as an absurdity: They before playing TTRPG games, it was appropriate to warn people about narrative content even as basic as drug use. I was deemed ignorant and insensitive, because after all, what if a player had a drug problem, or knew someone who died of a drug overdose or something?\n\nProblem with that is...they were unknowingly talking about \\*me\\*. My brother was an alcoholic and heroin addict, and died of liver cancer largely caused by the damage he did to himself. So if \\*I\\* find the concept of drug warnings before a TTRPG absurd - and even more so, if I know my brother himself would have \\*laughed in your face\\*, and likely said something sarcastic at the notion he needed a warning before a horrible, dangerous game of \\*Dungeons &amp; Dragons\\* 'trigged' and 'traumatized' him -  then what are these people talking about?\n\nSo, I try to understand what makes people wind up in those two different places a lot, and any insight to be given would be greatly appreciated.

The main one cited is that many work at the University of Minnesota Program in Sexuality, which is funded by the Tawani Foundation. This is apparently in contrast to Institute of Medicine recommendations that care guidelines be handled by generalists with consultation from invested experts, and to exclude those with COIs from leadership positions.\n\nNow, I'm not an expert in any of this, and even if this is all the case, it doesn't mean WPATH is wrong per se. I don't know if the explanation given for the guidelines is accurate, nor do I know if the IOM is even the most trusted authority on it. It seems to be a fairly notable organization, but that doesn't tell me much about this instance. All in all, is the characterization of WPATH in this article accurate?",

However the only thing that’s coming up from all my searches are examples of racial discrimination, and not racial prejudice.

Also everything is like 30 minutes away so going to anywhere there and back is an hour off your day.\n\nYou have more job opportunities and better ones to. Since there are more employers they need to compete for labor more. I feel this one because I live in a rural area and want a job for some spending money but the problem is that the jobs around me suck. I am noise sensitive and can't work in Kitchens so that gets rid of like half my options which are fast food. Also all my friends who live in Urban areas tell me that urban employers don't need as much commitment from individual workers because they have a larger labor pool. I am a full time student taking 5 classes I could only work one maybe two days a week. In my rural area since the labor pool is so small the employers demand more commitment from individual workers.  I have heard some people say that urban employers might not give you as many hours if you want to work a lot of hours but once again in a city everything is so much closer that having 2 jobs is more conceivable. While in a rural area everything is so far apart there is no way you could conceivably work 2 jobs in an optimal manner. Also since there are less employers they have a lot more power. I was really banking on a minimum wage increase that basically didn't happen. It has been delayed a bunch. \n\nYes in an urban area you do pay more for rent but most of the urban people I know are financially better of then their rural counterparts because they make so much more and they don't have to spend as much on gas. \n\nHas any sociologist talked about this ?

The specifics of that complex relationship aside, could this be true in theory? Have ideas about what \"good mothering\" means really changed so profoundly over time? \n\nI get to some extent that cultural norms have changed a lot, and one of the things that's changed is how we talk about it (mothering), but it seems like there should have always been some element of love and emotional connection between parent and child. Like to some degree what 2023 me thinks being a \"good  parent\" means. e.g. being willing to hear your child when they tell you that they got hurt (as my OCs mom did not want to do).

        "text": "I have recently been exposed to a number of retreat-based experiences or workshops for which the marketing follows a common pattern. It starts with telling or convincing the subject that their life is broken or unfulfilling, that they are holding harmful stories, and so forth, the. Professes to have the answer that will radically change the subject’s life (in one expensive workshop, or a series, etc.).  The pattern reminds me of religious cults or even military training where it is important to break someone down first. \n\nI am looking for any scholarly or even lay description of these tactics, especially from the standpoint of understanding the manipulation or social engineering involved in this form of marketing / delivery. \n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I've hit a bit of a dead end because I don't know how to narrow down my search to find the kind of thing I'm looking for, and I'd love to get pointed in the right direction.\n\nOne source I've got here makes it clear that as salaries go up, so do the number and size of bribes ([Ghana Police Corruption Study](https://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/miscellaneous_files/118_-_Opoku-Agyemang_Ghana_Police_Corruption_paper_revised_v3.pdf)) and anecdotally we understand that higher positions with greater authority and status incentivize bribe-seekers to extort larger amounts. There is also an assumption that larger bribes are more effective than smaller bribes, but most of the research I have found suggests that petty bribes are common and effective where large bribes can be rejected because it simply seems too big a risk.\n\nIn the above example, just for ease of searching, the bribes extorted by these police was an amount often around 1-5% of the total trip cost of the truckers being extorted. This amount went up after the salaries of the officers doubled, and in total it amounted to about a 23% increase in total bribe costs, but each individual bribe was pretty small--though not a negligible amount. It's impossible to extrapolate data from just one set into a larger picture though.\n\nI've looked at the World Bank and Transparency International, but all the data is aggregated and doesn't give me the kind of granularity I'm getting here, where I can see more clearly how the relationship between the service value (ie, overall road trip and time) and extortionist status/income level and bribe value can be teased out.\n\nIf I can build simple bit of a 'napkin math' model to help me ballpark some reasonable costs in a hypothetical system I'd be happy, and that's what I'm looking to do. Is there a study or something I'm missing that would give me the data I'm looking for, or is it really just this darn hard to figure out, given the highly variable, individualized nature (and poor reporting) of this kind of activity?",
