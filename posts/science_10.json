Properties of these Elements are already known, Hydrogen is energy. When we compare to other plants and vitamins normally used, we see that all these have the same Elements in common.\n\nVitamin E molecular formula: **C29H50O2**\n\nWe see that Vitamin E contains the same Elements: Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen, these are Elements found naturally in nature. \n\nVitamin A molecular formula: **C20H30O**\n\nVitamin D molecular formula: **C27H44O**\n\nWhen compared to other plants, we see that Cannabis contains the same Elements.\n\nBasil molecular formula: **C37H52O4**\n\nPeppermint molecular formula: **C62H108O7**\n\nRosemary molecular formula: **C18H16O8**\n\nSpinach molecular formula: **C55H70MgN4O6**\n\nWater molecular formula: **H20**\n\nEven Water contains Hydrogen.\n\nCannabis has been given a negative connotation, when it is just a normal plant that contains the same Elements as other normal plants. Often called Psychotropic, Cannabis receives a negative connotation, water is not psychotropic just because it contains Hydrogen.\n\nProhibiting the Free distribution of Cannabis is like prohibiting the distribution of lettuce, Vitamin E, or chili peppers. \n\nChili Peppers are of free distribution, but if one eats 2 kilograms of hot chili peppers, the results would not be healthy, still the free distribution of chili peppers is safe.\n\nThere is said to be a lack of Natural Resources, Cannabis is abundant in Hydrocarbons and Cellulose Fiber.\n\nFuel/Octane Gasoline molecular formula: **C8H18**\n\nDiesel molecular formula: **C12H23**\n\nWe see here that Carbon and Hydrogen are the main Elements of these natural resources.\n\nInstead of prohibiting these natural resources found in Cannabis, a normal plant, instead of throwing these natural resources away, they should be legal and of free distribution. \n\nShare Article\n\n\\*for Article in Spanish, visit my profile, under Post.",
