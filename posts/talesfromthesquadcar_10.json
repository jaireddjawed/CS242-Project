        "text": "A good family friend of ours is a Police Traffic Captain in Moscow, Russia. He's a genuinely friendly guy originally from south Russia and has a somewhat darker complexion. We'll call him Ivan.\n\nOne day he's off duty running some errands with a (non-LEO) buddy of his and is stopped at a red light in his little [Lada](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lada_2109_Samara_1300_S_Hanseat_Front.JPG). A car pulls up beside him with a white male driving. He starts waving and shouting at them through the window, so Ivan rolls down his window to see what's wrong. The guy is shouting racial slurs at him, having apparently mistaken him for a foreign worker (of which there are many in Moscow, many illegal too) from a southern country. Ivan rolls up the window, ignores him and continues to his destination. The guy follows him honking and flashing high beams, cutting him off etc. Ivan begins to suspect he might be high and/or drunk so he pulls over, calls his on duty collegues and tells them to come quickly. He then gets out to try and calm the other male who has also gotten out. Ivan quickly confirms that the guy has had a few too many vodkas. The man continues to swear at him, utter racial comments and tries to get physical. Ivan doesn't want to get into a fight and retreats around his car. The guy follows. Cue Ivan running circles around his Lada being chased by a drunk guy, kind of like in a cartoon. Ivan's friend is still inside the car dying of laughter. A few \"laps\" later the cops show up and promptly arrest the drunk guy. Ivan tells his collegues what happened (they crack up too) and then continues on his way.\n\nA few days later Ivan's back on duty at his desk (as Captain he commands an entire traffic district and all final paperwork has to go over his desk and have his signature). He's busy doing paperwork when guess who shows up in his office with court papers that require his signature? Drunk dude! Who as soon as he recognizes Ivan in his uniform begins to weep like a child and apologize and beg for forgiveness. Ivan tries to contain his laughter and console the man but tells him that ultimately he can't reverse any court descision. \n\nThe guy lost his license for a year or so and hopefully learned that Karma is a bitch.\n\nI've got a couple other stories from Ivan and Russia which I might post. This one is the funniest that I know of though. Hope I don't have too many typos and it all makes sense.",

        "text": "For the past few years I have been lucky enough to work as a Park Ranger in a community located on Lake Superior. Although I recently resigned, I have some great stories from my time there. Our biggest problems and all our fatalities came from tourists.\n\nI was on a foot patrol of a common cliff jumping spot In a very popular park. I always gave this spot extra attention because there is no cell signal so if there was an emergency 911 was not an immediate option. I had been on the job for a few years and had repeatedly asked for lifesaving equipment, warning signs, or even a emergency tower (like the campus ones) to be put up at the jumping area, all to no avail, the parks department wanted to keep everything as natural as possible. When I got out to the jumping spot I was surprised to see about 6 people out and about, two were the usual tourist types, but the rest had microphones and cameras, which was very out of the ordinary. Turns out, they were filming a video for their college, which was not from the area.\n\nThe very first thing that the director asked as I approached was if they could jump in the lake. I advised them against it, seeing as it was mid May and the snow had just finished melting, but also advised that I could not stop them from jumping either. The director, who was maybe 5'2\" and 110 pounds soaking wet declared that her crew would be filming at that location then. Seeing a potential disaster I decided to stick around in the area.\n\nThe first cameraman jumped in and immediately remarked that it was cold and this better be done in one take. The first actor jumped in, did his thing and swam back to shore like a torpedo, because the water was so cold. The second actor did the same, and I could see the relief on the cameraman's face when he finally was out of the lake. After some drying off the shocker came, the director wanted to jump and do her scene. The film crew and actors pleaded with her not to go in, it was too cold, they were concerned for her ability to swim, but no she wanted to jump, and filming anywhere else would cause continuity errors. Her cameraman jumped in and again tried to dissuade her, with no luck, she was going to jump no matter what.\n\nSomething was wrong as soon as she hit the lake, and as soon as she came up she was unable to keep her head above water and was screaming for help. The water was too cold to use a throw bag, because she couldn't hold on to it, I was going to have to go in. I tossed her cameraman a lifesaving tube (like the lifeguards use) and told him to use it to keep her afloat while I called for help, and had central roll everyone to my location, while I suited up to go in.\n\nThe thing about this jumping spot is that it is a 15 foot jump into what is about 35 feet of freezing cold Lake Superior, from there it's a 50 yard swim to anywhere that your feet can touch bottom. On that day the water temperature was estimated to be 35 degrees, my equipment was a mustang life jacket, t-shirt and uniform pants. Fire, EMS, Coast Guard were all on the way, but at least 7 minutes out. I had no idea that the water was just a smidge above freezing, but the director and her cameraman were having trouble making it in to shore.\n\nThe second I hit the water my only thought was \"I've mad a huge mistake\", cold doesn't even begin to describe it, everything went numb, all the air was sucked out of my lungs, it became difficult to breathe, and my mind went blank. It took a few seconds to remember what I was doing in the first place before I started swimming out to the pair. When I reached them, I was able to pull them ashore using the most pitiful breath stroke in have ever swam and get them wrapped in towels while I went to get my car keys. Her lips were blue and face was pale from the cold, and she couldn't stop shivering.\n\nFire/EMS arrived about 2 minutes after I pulled them out, it felt like an eternity. She was transported for a cold emergency, he was released on scene. I got chewed out for going in to save them and not letting USCG take care of it from their nice warm boats. There are still no signs/lifesaving equipment there and I don't patrol there nearly as much, because I don't want to do it again.\n\nMoral of the story: Don't jump in Lake Superior if you don't know Lake Superior.",

        "text": "This is one of my favorite stories.  It happened maybe one month into my training.  I was very new and this was the first time I really got a taste of crazy.\n\nMy training officer and I got a call for service at the local hospital.  A male called stating that his wife was refusing treatment, she was drunk, with a bottle of jack in her hand, and causing a disturbance.\nWe arrive at the hospital entrance and wander around a bit.  We see nothing.  My training officer gets the attention of a security guard and inquires about the incident.  The security guard tells him that the husband left in disgust and the wife left shortly thereafter.\n\nWhile we are talking to the security guard, his radio goes off and says the drunk female is now in the middle of the street, between the hospital and the local mall.\n\nSo we go back to the car.  Now, I am so new, I am not even trusted to drive the police car.  Rightfully so.\nWe drive to the street and see the female in the street.  I don’t see any bottle in her hand, thankfully.  I yell out the passenger side window, “Police officer, come over here and talk to me.”  She immediately does and about face and starts walking, at a brisk pace, away from me.  \n\nI jump out of the car and start to walk after her.  I am not in a big hurry, because she is headed for a very steep downhill, between the hospital and the mall.  She isn’t going anywhere.  I have her cornered!\n\nShe gets to the top of the hill and lies down on her belly, with her arms out in front of her (Superman style), parallel to the top of the hill.  What the fuck?\n\nI am about 10 feet away at this point.  She looks at me and rolls down the hill in a twirling Superman pose.  I run to the edge of the hill and I just catch her slamming into a concrete wall, about halfway down this steep hill.  She is now not moving.\n\nNow, keep in mind, I am very new.  So I turn to my partner and say, “Sir, should I call for paramedics?”  He says, “Yah, think?”  When you are new, you are afraid to do anything without approval.  You get over it quick or you get rolled out.\n\nI call for paramedics and start my VERY slow descent down this precariously steep hill.  As I reach the bottom, the female is awake.\n\nWhen I was new, I would shine my flashlight in a subjects eyes almost constantly.  It was a tactical thing that I thought was a good idea.  Someone probably told me to do it in the academy.  Blinds the person you are contacting, but it also pisses them off something fierce.  My flashlight is brighter than the sun.  I only do this now very rarely.\n\nThe first words out of her mouth are, “Get that flashlight out of my eyes you bald mother fucker!”  So I reply, “Ma’am, police officer, are you ok?”  “Don’t call me ma’am, you flat footed piece of shit!” she yells.\n\nMy partner comes up behind me and whispers to me, “Help her up the hill.  Do not cuff her.  Unless you want to carry her up this hill by yourself.”  That is why he is the training officer.  He also called her “miss”.  So she was sweet as pie to him.  She hated my ass.  Can’t say I blame her.  I was robot cop in the beginning.  I barely even broke a smile.  Now, I straight out laugh at people.  Because that shit…is funny.\n\nWe start up the hill.  She is chipping at me the whole way and I am doing my best to maintain my composure.  The fire department get there and about 7 feet from the top of the hill, one of the firemen tries to grab her arm to help her up the hill.  She immediately tries to bite him.  I put her face into the dirt…hard.  I’m not gonna lie…that was enjoyable.  My partner chimes in, “You are under arrest for assault and drunk in public.”  That was my cue.  I put cuffs on her.\n\nThe fire department paramedics check her out and clear her for the ride to the clink.  Normally, that would be the end of the story.  Not so much.\n\nJust to get her in the back of the police car takes 20 minutes.  It was ridiculous.  I have never since had this much problem getting someone in the back of a police car.  This could be due to experience, but she was a special kind of drunk and crazy to boot.  Every once in a while I think, “I wonder if this person is completely normal when not drunk as all fuck.”\n\nShe jams her foot in between the door frame and the door so we cannot pull her in.  We finally yank her in the backseat.  She tries to bite me and spit on me.  I grab her hair to pull her all the way in the back.  She looks right in my eyes and says, “Pull my hair you dirty sumbitch!  I like it.”\n\nOne of the senior guys shows up on scene and helps us out.  He talks to her, butters her up, and in the blink of an eye, slams her to the ground so we can hobble her legs.  Damn!\n\nMy training officer says, “We will do the paperwork at the jail.  Let’s get out of here before something else happens.”  I am more than happy to oblige as I am soaked in sweat from wrestling this fine lady in the back of the police car for the past 20 damn minutes.\n\nShe is yelling and carrying on in the back until we get about halfway to the jail.  She yells, “I am going to kill myself back here and it will be your fault, you cocksuckers!”  What can she do?  She is handcuffed, hobbled to the door, in plastic molded seats, and in the seatbelt.\n\nSomehow, she is able to get the shoulder harness wrapped around her neck and she begins to gag.  Holy shit!  So we stop the car, I jump out and immediately unhook the shoulder strap.\n\nShe gasps for air and is quiet.  In fact, she doesn’t say a word the rest of the trip.  I guess she scared even herself, or she ran out of steam.\n\nI remember thinking to myself, “What have I gotten myself into….this is awesome!”\n",

We're more than reserves and csos.\n\nAnyway.  Story. \n\nA time ago I was heading back to base for a detail woth the supervisor.  On my way there I was dispatched to a 911 call from a lady who didn't want to give any more information about herself but demanded someone respond for a simple rule violation in a park. \n\nI sigh and respond.  I show up and quickly find out who the caller is... possibly EDP, but most likely just batshit crazy. Her complaint was that a man did nit pick up his dog's excrement in a timely manner and thus demanded that he be ticketed and then banned/trespassed from the park. \n\nTaken as information. \n\nI find the guy who is at the center of all this and hes of elder age and slightly handicapped.  He explains his side of the story which was lining up with hers minus a few details.  These details were important to me as his story was a lot more believable than the complainant. \n\nGet both their information.  Run both.  V/C. Male has a clean record, comp does not. Make my decision on what to do: a simple VW. \n\nI explain to both parties separately on why I made my decision.  The man was relieved and agreed to leave for the day... the complainant was the opposite of happy.  She was livid at me. Started bitching me out for not doing my job and how its a disgrace to the park how I let this go unpunished. \n\nI explain to her that the courts wouldn't agree with me ticketing although I could've.  Same with trespassing. Again she didn't like it.  At this time dispatch already had to check in on me since I timed out... on a shit 911 call. \n\nShe demanded my name and badge number.  I gave her both and told her that she is to not pick up other people's dog shit. Ever.\n\nGot back to base and explained the call to my boss. This was the most ridiculous thing ever.\n\nHe said \" if you aren't getting complaints than you're not doing your job right\"\n\nBtw. The story was that she confronted the man immediately after he left the poop... basically telling him off and she then proceeded to pick it up.The man left the excrement there because he was walking to the dog waste site to get a bag.\n\n\nSorry if errors.

Suffice to say, its SWAT, but with a different name). One day, on his occasional visits to our house to check in and have a coffee with the family, he wants to show us his new addition to his truck.\n\nNow, his truck is a bit famous around here. Its his work car, a modified pickup with a full gun safe integrated into the bed. Basically, he has all the gear he could ever need at his fingertips, should a nasty call ensue.\n\nso, he pulls up to the house and calls us over. inside his cache of armor and heavy weapons is a new addition- [an M82-A1 anti-material rifle](http://media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/13481/13749130_1.jpg?v=8CF5244A5C7FC90).\n\nHe told us that during a sting operation, a prior felon was apprehended selling guns and meth, and one of the guns in his illegal collection was this monster. Because of its high powered nature, it was given to said SWAT like agency for tactical use.\n\nThe LEO in question doubted he would ever need such a weapon, but it was a nice add on to his growing 'truck-collection', of witch there are a few more stories. The only op he could conceive using it in would be target elimination in a hostage situation in the newly made cross-city gondola.\n\nBut to be honest, it has been simply a show piece for the last few years. He *is* trained on the weapon system, but hopes he never has to use it in the field.\n\nEdit-changed 'tank' to 'material'. Just a stupid mistake.\n\nI might have been just a bit drunk when I wrote this. Sorry for the mix up.",

He (we'll call him Mustang for the story) was the head of a small vocational facility that housed the Cisco CCNA course I was taking, and he shared this with us during a break.  Apologies for fuzzy details.\n\nSo back in the 70s, Mustang drove an unmarked yellow Ford Mustang, and this tale comes from his time patrolling the Indiana Toll Road.  For those not familiar with it, it's a fairly straight stretch of highway from Chicago to the Ohio border.  Mustang's somewhere near La Porte/Michigan City (about 45 minutes east of Chicago) near the end of his shift, when he clocks a guy (we'll call him Speedy) doing 90 or so.  Given that Mustang lives on the Ohio side of the state, this seems like a nice way to get back home, and he decides to follow Speedy rather than pull him over.  So the two of them do 90 across the state until they approach Mustang's exit, at which point he flips the lights on and pulls Speedy over.  Speedy had seen Mustang in his mirror for most of the drive, so he's a bit confused and asks why Mustang waited so long to pull him over.  Mustang's reply: \"Hey, I wanted to get home, too!\"",

        "text": "I realized the paperwork was piling up faster than it was being shredded sometime after lunch. I hadn’t noticed the severity of my case load prior to that due to various errands and menial favors with assisting my coworkers but as I sat back down at my desk, the looming stack of files towered precariously over me like an elderly game of Jenga. \n\n“Crap.” I muttered to myself. \n\nJohn must’ve heard me and was probably looking for any excuse to get away from his eye-burning computer monitor. “What’s wrong?” He asked as he wheeled his ergonomic leather chair over to my cubicle. \n\n“Too much paperwork, same as always.” I sighed and massaged the bridge of my nose. Work comes in waves and I had the feeling I was about to start my voyage up a tsunami. \n\n“Ah man, me to. I got four cases yesterday. Can’t keep up with ‘em!” John sighed as well and we both let the annoyed silence linger a moment. “Oh well, what’re you going to do? Can’t argue with job security.”\n\nI agreed and turned back to my computer as John wheeled back to his.  I pulled the top file off the stack and perused its contents. On its surface it seemed pretty open and shut: lock up a guy who was wanted for missing court on a felony drug charge. I pulled up one of the many databases at my disposal, specifically one that aggregates police arrest data from my region, and typed in my target’s name. The quick return had several contacts confirming he indeed still lived at his recorded address. I felt a moment of relief as I realized this one had the potential to not be a “whodunit.”\n\nAfter I completed my version of a case jacket, I decided to go take a drive around the neighborhood I hoped my target still lived. It was right down the road and very familiar to me both from my time working the street and in CID. It wasn’t a very dangerous neighborhood, per se, but it did have its share of bad incidents. \n\nI pulled into the parking lot of a 7-11 near the target location and, on a hunch, brought in the wanted poster with me while I gathered provisions for the stake-out assignment. I approached the counter to make my purchase and made small talk with the clerk while he rang me up. It was a slow day at the 7-11, between the morning day-labor coffee rush and the afternoon, pre-pubescent Slurpee rush. I asked if he had seen the guy in my picture as I slid it across the counter to him. \n\n“Oh, yes. I see him all the time. Maybe… yesterday?” He called over a co-worker who also knew my target’s face.\n\n“He comes every afternoon or so. Likes the Swisher Sweets and Big Bites!” They even had his “usual” down pat. I thanked them for their help after passing along my card with my phone number to call the next time they saw him and made my way back to the car, more confident now I was hot on the trail of the target. \n\nThe target’s house was a short distance away – the end unit in a row of townhouses. I found a spot where I could watch over the front of the home while still maintaining some distance and at the same time blending in with other vehicles. \n\nMy cruiser is anything but the typical police car – more fit for a soccer mom that a detective, but that fact coupled with the dark tinted windows made it an ideal platform to observe the goings-on in the neighborhood. I let my car idle and pulled out my computer to start running tags as well as continue hunting for any social media accounts related to my target. I had struck out before, back in the office, but it was worth the persistence if I found something. Also, I figured, as was the usual on these stakeout assignments, I was in for a long wait. I would be working on bad-guy time. \n\nTime passes slowly when doing menial tasks, and this was definitely in that territory. Every few seconds I’d glance up from my computer to make sure the door hadn’t opened and no one was staring at me. After about an hour, I was thinking I was still too early to catch my guy awake and active – it was only 11:00AM after all. \n\nJust as the thought entered my head to retreat for a later-in-the-day attempt, the door opened. An older lady, probably in her sixties, came tottering out of the house. She was the same race as my target, so I mentally checked that box on the old ‘surveillance check sheet’ but I couldn’t see anyone else moving around inside during the brief moment the door was ajar. I checked my case file for any possible relatives who matched her age and descriptors but everything I had on the place indicated no females lived there at all. \n\nAs I placed the file back on my seat, I realized the lady was making her way through the parking lot in my direction. I turned off the ignition and lowered my seat to prevent her from seeing me in case she crossed in front of my windshield. A moment later she did just that, but judging by her glazed over stare, I could have been decked out on my creepiest Pennywise costume and honking my comically red horn nose and she wouldn’t have realized I was there. \n\nThe woman opened the door to an old Toyota four door a couple spaces down and sat down. I tried to keep out of sight while glancing back at the house, hopeful her departure might spark some further movement of the occupants within. There was nothing of note, however, so I turned back to see what the lady was doing. \n\nShe was sitting in her car on the driver’s seat, legs still outside and planted on the asphalt parking lot. She lazily smacked her lips and scratched an itch on her neck as she squinted up into the sky. I turned back to the house again, thinking maybe she was waiting on someone. \n\nAfter a few moments with no movement, I glanced back in her direction. She was staring at my car now, and for a moment I was concerned I had been made somehow. I realized quickly, however – due to her inattentive gaze, half closed eyes, and slow swaying torso- that that she was still oblivious to my presence and possibly drunk to boot. “What the hell is she doing and why won’t she just leave?” I wondered to myself. \n\nI figured I’d ignore her and devote my attention instead back to my house. I was stuck there at least as long as she lingered, reclined in an awkward position and barely able to see the front door belonging to my target. I took out my binoculars and scanned the windows individually. There was absolutely no movement inside. \n\nAnnoyed, I turned once more back to the lady, hoping she might be showing signs of departing soon. Instead, I was gifted a vision which is burnt into my psyche: The lady had her legs spread apart, skirt hiked up to mid-thigh. She was casually combing through her jungle of pubic hair, searching for God knows what. I stifled a scream of terror and shifted my body down so the roof pillar was blocking my view. “Jesus Christ! In broad daylight!”\n\nA quick glance back to the house… no change. I tried to focus on something else, anything else, to distract me from the horror not a dozen feet away from me. “Oh, that fence is well built. And what a nice way to arrange those bird feeders! I wonder if that lady is still combing through her vaginal hair?”\n\nNo. I refused to look. I was resolute in my decision… but it nagged. That car wreck called to me like a siren, imploring me to further ruin any chance of keeping down my lunch. Slowly, I pushed myself up and rotated my head. There was no way she could still be going at it. \n\nI was terribly mistaken in my prophecy. Not only was she still going at it, but now she was bent over at the waist, straining her neck to get a better view of her nether regions and working apart her skin folds with both hands. \n\nScrew this. I’d had enough. I sat up, turned the car on, dropped it into gear, and pulled away. I was no masochist. \n\nIn my rearview, I saw the lady look up from her previously engagement and look at my departing vehicle with a quizzical glare, legs still spread for all the world to by tainted by. I’d find my guy another day.\n",

        "text": "Last Sunday, I am driving along our main drag and I see, out of the corner of my eye, a car down one of our side streets, with its flashers on.  You know, the blinking amber lights you turn on if your car is disabled on the side of the highway.  Now, I am on my way to some other call, so I drive on.\n\nAbout an hour later, I drive past the same street and see the car is still there.  Hmm.  That's weird.\n\nSo I pull in behind it.  It is a four door Honda Accord and it is double parked in a two lane side street.  So it is effectively blocking one lane of traffic.   The flashers are still on, the vehicle is running, and...wait for it...the car is unlocked.\n\nI run the license plate.  It is not stolen and it is registered to an apartment in the complex just to my right.\n\nIt is like one in the morning, so my usual PA announcement to move your damn car won't fly.  I have a report to do, so I decide to do it while I wait.  I certainly don't want to come back to take the stolen vehicle report.  I am hoping the owner will come out while I am there.\n\nHonestly, I am SHOCKED, it hasn't been stolen yet.  Hood rats are slipping.\n\nI get my report done in about 30 minutes.  Still no sign of the owner.  Shit, I guess I have to do something.\n\nSo I get out to the front gate of the apartment complex, open the fire lockbox, and the key is nowhere to be found.  Fuck!  Someone forgot to put it back.  I'll blame them damn hose draggers.  Hope there isn't an emergency in here.\n\nI walk all the way around and find a neighbor walking around to let me in.  The numbering system in this complex is a joke.  I am looking for number 26.  I find 24, 25, and 27 on the south side.  Where the hell is 26?!?\n\nAfter walking around like a jackass for about 10 minutes, I find a door, on the north side that has a 2 on it, with another number scratched off.  Since I have been to every other damn apartment in the place, this must be it.\n\nI take my flashlight out and knock like I am going to bust in the door.  It is about 80 degrees and humid as hell.  So I am sweating from walking around and just generally getting more and more pissed off.  I am thinking to myself, \"I should have just towed the damn car.\"\n\nDude comes to the front door and barely speaks any English.  \"Is that your car?!\", I ask.  He nods his head.  \"Come out here and move it, or I will tow it.\"\n\nAfter about three minutes I finally get through to him that he doesn't need his keys, because they are in his running car.\n\nI wish he spoke English.  I want to know, how does this happen?\n\nThe cynic in me thinks he was drunk, and left it out in the middle of the street, running, with the hazards on, and unlocked, but he didn't appear or smell drunk.\n\nIn his defense, he came out and thanked me, after he moved his car.\n\nNot the most interesting story, but I was just dumbfounded.  I told my partner about it, and he thanked me.  It was his area, and he would have had a stolen vehicle report.\n\nI will call that my good deed of the week and hope he didn't deserve to be towed after being drunk.",

        "text": "I slinked into the roll call room and quickly grabbed a seat in the back, hoping to go unnoticed by the supervisor drawing on the white board up front. \n\n“Glad to see our uniform showed up. Get stuck writing an old lady a jaywalking ticket or something?” The Lt spoke to the white board but I knew the jab was meant for me and chose to ignore it. With his uncanny ability to see out the back of his head, he would have been better suited as a high school history teacher if not for his preference of brawn over brain power. To say our relationship was contemptuous would be putting it mildly – he was another of the group that disliked my dad from his days in the academy and was the type of “Macho” guy I’d avoid if I didn’t have to work with him as a subordinate. His hulking, muscular, frame blocked the intricate drawing he was concentrating on from my view. \n\nWhen he finished, he turned around with a bit of a flourish, clearly impressed by his masterwork. “Here it is; the park.” Sure enough, he had drawn a well-executed sketch of the park where today’s operation was to take place. I glanced around to the other guys in the room to see if I was the only one still in the dark as to what task was ahead of us. I had been told by my supervisor I would be “on loan” to the Enforcement Team that afternoon, and that I’d be working in one of the large community parks, but outside of that, I had no idea what I was in for. Judging by the lack of interest on the faces of the regular team members, it wasn’t going to be particularly exciting. Awesome. \n\nLt began drawing “X’s” and “O’s” on the board in specific spots. “Ok - Dan, Mike – you two will be plain clothes in this area. There’s a bench here and you’ll have a good view of the bathroom structure here.” He tapped on various rectangles to accentuate his speech. Dan and Mike, the two senior guys, both shrugged their shoulders at their assignment and turned their attention back to cleaning their fingernails. \n\n“Howie, Brian – you two dress down to workout clothes and linger in this area-” TAP! “-pretending to stretch for a jog or something. You’ll have eyeballs on the back entrance and keep your radios in your ear to monitor traffic and add any lookouts.” Howie and Brian were newer and feigned interest in their assignments a moment or two longer than their senior partners. \n\n“That leaves EMR, the uniform, to park down here-” TAP! “-out of view but monitoring the radio. You’ll move in if and when we have positive on a custody situation.” I nodded and realized how far out of the action I would be. Oh well, I’d have my favorite talk radio show on to pass the time and it was a beautiful day outside. \n\n“And finally – Roy. You ready to suit up?” Lt smiled wide at Roy, the most recent addition to the team and new to police work in general. He had only been on the street a few months before being hand-picked by the Lt to take a vacant spot on the Enforcement Team (ET). Many guys at the station were upset by the choice and it was pretty obvious Roy’s prominence on the Lt’s softball team had a lot to do with his rapid ascent. It certainly wasn’t a result of hard work and a willingness to be a team player.\n\n“Whatever, dude. I just want to get this shit over with.” Roy sassed the Lt as only one of his “bros” could and the Lt laughed at his reaction. \n\n“C’mon, you know you have to put up with a little hazing. You’re the rook!” The Lt folded his massive arms and smiled wide. “Besides, this is right up your... *alley*!” He seemed to ponder his choice of words carefully, implying a possible homosexual undertone usually prevalent in these “ribbing sessions.”\n\n“Shut up, man. I’m gonna do this bullshit and then I’m done. You promised this would be the end.” I still had no idea what we were doing so I waited until my attempt at eye contact attracted the Lt’s attention. It took a while as he basked in Roy’s uncomfortableness. \n\n“Hey boss. What exactly is the op today?” I asked once he acknowledged my existence. \n\n“Heh-heh… We’re hunting a gay dude who’s been terrorizing the bathroom by the tennis courts.” Roy’s reluctance to play the UC, usually a coveted position, suddenly became clear. “Ole Roy here’s going to wear the official ET “Gay Reversal” uniform and the wire. He’s got to bait the guy in and get enough to charge him with something. Too many of those yuppie tennis guys have complained about this to not walk away with an arrest to show the captain.”\n\nI glanced at Roy, my senior in age but with years less time on then I had. Normally, in the uber-macho ranking of the police world, that would have indicated I could throw a snigger in his direction, reveling in his discomfort. The daggers being cast in my direction by the brutish Roy made me second guess myself, however, so I just gave him a confused squint of my eyes. \n\nThe Lt picked up on it so he explained further with a roll of his eyes. “Some dude has been offering blowjobs by writing the date and time on one of the stalls. Apparently it’s been going on a while but recently, I guess due to a lack of customers, he’s also been exposing himself to the tennis dudes that come in to drain their lizards. We got nothing as far as an ID on him and it’s not easy to make an exposure case taking place in the confines of a public restroom anyway. Roy’s got to get him to offer a BJ or something so we can pop him!” The twinkle in his eyes contrasted with the rest of his team’s lack of enthusiasm and I internally questioned the true motive of the operation. “Get to it!” Lt interrupted my thought train with a loud clap and pointed finger in the direction of the locker room. \n\nRoy stood up and sulked to the door, shoulders slumped and best beaten puppy-dog expression on his sad face. A few minutes later, everyone re-grouped in the roll call room. The mood had shifted in a more energetic fashion. Howie and Brian were in their shorts and Under Armor shirts, ear buds already plugged into their ears on one end, radios on the other. Dan and Mike were dressed in their street clothes and resembled something more akin to outlaw bikers than yuppie tennis players. Then Roy walked in. \n\nSomehow, Roy had managed to squeeze his six foot four, steroid-user-esque body into a “smedium” pink Polo shirt and a pair of skin tight navy blue boat shorts. His nipples poked outward as the cloth fought valiantly to not split open across his chest, Hulk Hogan like, at any moment. His outfit was lacking in the shoe department though – the ankle high, dark grey basketball shoes clashed with the rest of the ensemble. He looked both ridiculous and uncomfortable and it was clear he didn’t like the joke. Everyone but me erupted in laughter, including the boss. \n\n“You look… perfect!” Lt squeezed out between guffaws. \n\n“Screw you all.” Roy mumbled as he took a seat. \n\n“Any questions?” Lt asked, wiping a tear from his eye.\n\nDan raised his hand. “Yeah, what happens if we can’t get to Roy fast enough? Should he go home with his sugar daddy?” The room erupted again with laughter and Roy turned beet red with anger although he didn’t offer a reply.\n\n“Haha, oh man… ok!” His voice trailed at the end. “Let’s hit it!” Lt clapped his hands again, like a manic football coach, immediately switching from hilarity to urgency in a millisecond. The guys laughed with each other behind me as we made our way out to the cars.\n\nThe operation itself was very slow. I sat for about an hour before I heard the first radio traffic – Mike asking if he had Roy’s permission to use the restroom without being molested by him followed by someone’s need to key up a mike and share their laugh over the air – and there were very few people coming into the quiet park nestled between busy neighborhoods off a major throughway. I was as ready for the operation to be over as I assumed Roy was. Another few minutes passed before the first real action happened.\n\n“There’s a dude creeping his way up to the bathroom now.” Dan whispered over the radio. \n\nLt came across. “Is he a tennis player?”\n\n“Nah - old guy, wearing khakis and a button down shirt. Brown hat, leather shoes... looks shady and he keeps staring at the guys on the tennis courts too.” Dan’s voice was a little louder now, indicating the guy was still making his way to the bathroom. \n\n“Ok, I’ve got the wire up. Will update if Roy gets anything on *his hook*.” I could picture Lt’s mischievous grin from his weakly executed innuendo. \n\nMike came across next. “Ok, we have him, he’s walking in now.”  The appointment time had been missed by an hour or so, but apparently punctuality isn’t necessary in homosexual park liaisons. I wondered how Roy was taking the man’s entrance into their love nest. \n\nSeveral minutes passed as Lt maneuvered his chess pieces closer to the bathroom to prevent the subject from fleeing.  He wasn’t giving any updates over the radio concerning what was being said but apparently his legal hurdle for probable cause hadn’t been jumped yet. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Lt came across the radio, amped up and urgent. “EMR!!! MOVE IN MOVE IN MOVE IN!!!” \n\nI don’t know why but I peeled out of my parking space and only realized the lack of emergency as I pulled up the large hill to the tennis court area. I felt foolish as I sped by a couple walking their dog and slowed down once I turned a bend out of their view. If it meant Roy had to endure an extra second or two of gay advancements, so be it. \n\nI pulled up and saw the other four guys, barely incognito in their terrible UC attire and congregated around the small bath house, and made my way for the door. I pushed it open with apprehension and was surprised by what I found: Pressed with his back against the wall and one knee up in a defensive position, Roy couldn’t have looked like he wanted out of there any worse. His face was scrunched up in disgust and he looked as though he was about to cry as he turned to me, his salvation, and away from the closed eyed, smooch-mouthed elderly man leaning in for a kiss. \n\n“FUCK THIS!” He screamed, silver back ape-like, and he shoved by both the old man and me and stormed out the door. We both watched him leave with equal levels of confusion before the man noticed me. \n\n“Oh. Are you here for…” He left the last part unspoken but I noodled out what he was hoping my answer would be. I disappointed him with my answer. \n\n“No. I’m here because, well… I guess… you’re under arrest?” I really wasn’t sure what to do so I just pulled out my cuffs and he turned, super-complaint, to allow me to cuff him. He giggled softly as I ratcheted them tight (creepy, I have to admit) before double locking them and exiting back into daylight. \n\nThe rest of the crew was outside, arms folded and trying to look intimidating. The old man didn’t seem to notice. “So, was that young man a cop? Wow!” He didn’t seem to mind his current predicament and glanced about, impressed either by our show of force or the quality of man meat presented before him. \n\nLt pulled up the undercover truck he had been driving and got out. He smirked as he approached and then full out smiled when he saw Roy pacing with aggressive energy in the grassy area a few yards away. \n\n“Sir, we have you on audio requesting numerous sexual acts from an undercover officer. I want to inform you you’re under arrest for lewdness and public indecency. Do you have anything to say?” He looked serious as he addressed the prisoner.\n\nThe old man peered over Lt’s shoulder at Roy, still pacing with balled up fists and smiled wide. “I knew he was too good to be true!” He sighed dreamily. \n\nI never did get the full skinny on exactly what happened in the bathroom. I was a part of the joke, however, when the picture of Roy popped up, dressed in his ET-UC uniform, on the locker room wall with a caption contest sheet taped underneath. \n\n“Lt’s little man!” I wrote with my left hand in pencil so as not to be identified by the sure-to-go-postal beast.\n",

The deputy and I were in a small town in an unincorporated part of the county; the car's lights were off, and we were looking for trouble. We started tailing a car (after flipping on the headlights, of course) that the deputy wanted to stop. We came to a stop sign, and of course the driver of the other vehicle made a complete stop. As we came to another stop sign, another car cut off our traffic-obeying friend as he turned. We ditched our initial prey and went after our new target.\n\nAs the deputy called out the stop and flipped on the overhead red and blues, the subject continued driving, turned into an apartment parking lot, and stopped in a parking space. A young man was driving, and his girlfriend was in the passenger seat. The deputy went up and made contact, and he soon had the driver exit from the vehicle. Soon, another cruiser with an FTO and her trainee arrived behind us. The deputies suspected that the driver was drunk. Because the local SO does not conduct DUI investigations, they called in a \"possible,\" and we waited for the highway patrol to arrive.\n\nAfter 45 minutes of decent conversation between the deputies and the subject, the highway patrol guys finally arrived. They conducted explained their process to the subject, began to conduct the FSTs, and then breathalyzed the guy.\n\nAfter blowing well above the legal limit, the subject was placed in cuffs for his second DUI. As I mentioned before, he pulled into an apartment parking space. Fortunately for him, it was *his* parking space, so there was no towing required.\n\nHe made it aaaaaall the way home, but he was still arrested for a DUI. It was awesome. Also, his girlfriend was licensed and sober.",

So, we arrested the kid the locker belonged to. Of course we read him his rights. We asked him how did you get this...\n\nHe says his dad grew it.\n\nWhere did he grow it...\n\nMy dad grows it in the basement.\n\nAt that point I called this in (I was in the school's SRO office) and called in the address. We asked the kid what he was planning to do with the weed.\n\nSmoke it. By myself.\n\nThe amount was small enough to believe it, and he only had one bag, and this kid didn't have a criminal history, but his dad was growing, so I waited before we filed charges, to see what his dad had to say.\n\nTurns out his dad was batshit insane.\n\n\"That little shit sold me out! What is that little bitches problem! That pisspants stole my weed! I'll beat that cock sucker's ass!\" We tried talking to him, but he decided to try to hit one of my co workers. At that point we were sure the kid wasn't planning to sell weed. We decided not to press charges, and just to hand out a municipal citation for a low amount. \n\nYou can bet your bottom wallace that his dad was locked up in county for the night.\n\nThe kid actually straightened out after that. Turns out he was using weed to escape from his problems at home. He went on to live with his mom, and wound up graduating, with honors.",

        "text": "Josh came in to Roll late. He was an absolute mess. Unshaven, uniform wrinkled, belt keepers unclipped, hair barely combed, radio mic swinging around instead of being attached to some portion of his shirt, everything was disheveled. Sergeant Cookie stopped mid-sentence to take in the travesty that walked in to the room while the rest of us quietly snickered and whipped out our phones to capture the moment of the one who has a hard on for calling other people out for bad uniform practice.\n\nHe took a seat near me. Sarge cleared his throat and continued with \"I guess this is a good time to remind everyone about the tardy policy and professional uniform appearance SOP...\" This was met with a series of groans and someone in the back called out \"Way to go, asshole.\"\n\nJosh groaned and shook his head. His face was red and he tried hard to disappear in to his seat. I poked him in the ribs \"Guess last night was a doozy...\" He shot me a look that can only be translated to \"I will kill you.\" before turning back to the Sergeant. \n\nOnce Roll Call let out, the other guys jumped out of their seats and rushed towards equipment check-out. Some stayed behind to give Josh more crap for his uniform, and to distract him while the other patrol units grabbed the keys for the nicer vehicles. When Josh stepped up, the only vehicle left was the beater we kept when depot had to repair one of the other vehicles. It had seen more than a decade of service, and was a running miracle of scraped together parts, bubblegum, paperclips, and duct tape.\n\nHe sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. The veins in his forehead visibly pulsed with rage. \"The shit I put up with...\" he muttered under his breath.\n\nThe day was pretty slow, at least for me. Josh was being run ragged, being sent to the bulk of the door alarms and low-level calls. Payback for the sloppy uniform from the Dispatchers, no doubt.\n\nThe alert tones started while I was interviewing a complainant for a stolen bicycle. It was a flash lookout for a domestic that just occurred. The subject had fled on foot and was heading away from me, with the location of the initial incident on the other side of campus.  Josh pulled up behind me a moment after the broadcast.\n\nI turned to him and tried to give him the \"Save me!\" face to get away from my chatty complainant; however, he just sat there and stared at me. Throughout the day, most of the crappy assignments had been passed off to him, and his run-sheet was marked to capacity with door checks and smoke alarms. I'm sure he just loved life at this point. \n\nI turned back to my complainant for a moment when he hit the air horn and shouted through the PA \"Kik! We have to go!\" I nervously turned towards my complainant, fearing a complaint from them was in the foreseeable future and thanked them for the information. I barely had time to pass them a business card with case numbers before Josh hit the PA again. \n\nI quickly secured my bike and jumped in to the passenger seat of the waiting cruiser. I barely had time to close the door before Josh peeled out and gunned the ancient cruiser down the road.\n\n\"Having a rough day, buddy?\" I said, trying to add a bit of humor to it over the wail of the siren. Josh looked at me again with the \"I'm going to kill you\" stare as he braked and turned sharply on to a side road without looking. That caused my heart to skip a few beats, and I shut my mouth. He was PISSED.\n\nWe pulled up as the initial officer was just getting done talking to the complainant. She was visibly upset and crying, but appeared to be unharmed. The officer updated the Flash over the radio with a better description of the subject and direction of travel. He then added that the suspect was extremely intoxicated and to use caution. \n\nGreat. Our specialty. Drunk assholes who liked to fight. Josh and I hopped back in the cruiser and we marked on canvass.\n\nWe were driving along a road that runs along a large field beside a cluster of academic buildings that's sometimes used for large events like student concerts. There was a lot of activity there during the daytime. It was a gathering place for students to unwind and throw a football around or start a game of baseball.\n\nI spotted our prey stumbling on the sidewalk leading to the yard area. He was trying very hard to maintain a steady but quick pace, while trying not to fall flat on his face from the intoxication. He was hunched over, arms swinging from side to side, as if he were a hockey player skating along trying to build momentum to go faster. We pulled up behind him and both of us jumped out.\n\n\"Police! Freeze!\" I yelled at him. Josh was coming from the side, angling in case he decided to run or turn around and attack us. He suddenly spun around. And when I say suddenly, I mean he very slowly flung both of his arms in the air, which spun his body around, slowly, which carried his entire body around with him in a slow circle that ended with him falling flat on his back. The back of his head smacked the pavement hard, knocking him out cold.\n\nJosh and I quickly ran up to him. I radioed for EMS support as we checked him over to ensure he wasn't leaking brain matter. He was peacefully lying on his back, with a huge goofy smile on his face, quietly snoozing as we rushed to ensure he wasn't going to die. \n\nThe ambulance pulled up just as we finished checking him over. They rushed up with a backboard and prepared to scoop him and rush to the hospital when I noticed the two barely 100 pound (combined) EMS workers were having trouble rolling the subject so they could get the backboard under him. \n\nJosh looked at me and I shook my head \"This is all you, man. I don't want to get my uniform dirty.\" He breathed sharply and gave me a look, then grabbed the subject by the waist to haul him on to the backboard. A patch of gravel was under his feet when he did it, causing him to slip and the subject slid up on to his leg. He struggled, getting more entangled with the subject. Finally with some effort, he was able to haul the guy on to the board. The medics strapped him in and Josh helped them lift him to the stretcher. When he stepped back, I noticed a brown streak across his pants leg.\n\n\"Damn man. Not only is your shirt wrinkled, but you got mud all over your pants. You're just a fucking mess today dude!\" I laughed, but then my eyes wandered to the backboard where I noticed the same brown substance that was on Josh's leg dripping from the side of the stretcher from the subjects pants. There was also a large brown stain on the sidewalk right where he was lying previously.\n\n\"Dude... That's not...\" I looked at him and I could see the veins popping in his head again. He shook his head, breathed out heavily, and grumbled \"The shit I put up with...\"\n\nHe wasn't kidding.\n",

So I responded to the call because I had just wrapped up a traffic accident report (it was PDO) and it was a block away. When I arrived to the scene, the woman was being chased by two attack dogs, so I called for backup and for animal control. Just then a third dog came out of no where so I parked my vehicle and told the woman to get in the back of the squad car. I held the dogs of  while she got in (used my baton to confuse them, didn't hit them though, that would agrrivate them further). Backup arrived and closed down the section of street and just as they did that, a forth and fifth dog came out of no where so we called this back into dispatch. \n\nWhen animal control arrived, they captured four pitbulls, a collie, and a chocolate lab. The collie and lab where returned to their owners, and the pitbulls were sent to the human society, and they are undergoing behavioral rehabilitation.",

        "text": "Just got off shift and managed to personally take two completely bizarre calls back to back today. One hilarious, one not so. Thought you might like to hear about them - \n\n''Hello Police Emergency, how can I help?'' Call comes through from a male, who states he is a construction worker and has been carrying out some work on behalf of the local council. As part of their project he and his colleagues have put up a load of scaffolding on the exterior of a block of flats, and in doing so have spotted something strange inside one of the property's. Caller states that the inside of one of the flats is ''well, covered in, you know, *indecent* pictures of children.''\n\nI ask caller exactly what he has seen and it transpires that we are not just talking about a couple of photo's spotted on a desk or by the window. The whole of the property has what appears to *professionally made* wallpaper, made up of child porn photo's. It is covering every inch of wall. Floor to ceiling. In every visible room. WTF? Caller has taken a photo of the view from the exterior of the property to show us, and is understandably nervous just having that in his possession. The owner of this property has made himself a cave of the stuff.\n\nWe run intel on the address, the resident there has previous for indecent exposure and being in possession of hardcore pornography in which he had taped children's faces over the models ones. I expect it will have been passed to Specialist Operations by now - no idea what happened after the call.\n\n\n*For the next story it is probably important that you know I do not work for a rural force. Our policing area is a major, densely populated urban city.*\n\nNot fifteen seconds after I hang up - my next call comes through and opens with the female caller telling me ''well, I'm not sure it's an emergency but something has to be done.''\n\nShe gives me the location, I punch it in, and a possible match for a previous call made a few minutes before pings up. I give it a quick read. It is only one line and has been given the typecode ''314 - Suspicious Circumstances'':-\n\n^ OP - CALLER STATES THAT HE HAS JUST SEEN A WOMAN TRYING TO HERD A PEACOCK INTO A PUB. NFDS.\n\nMy caller tells me that there is indeed a peacock running around a busy intersection, causing a major traffic hazard as cars are having to swerve to avoid hitting it. We have no idea where it has come from.\n\nI send it downstairs to despatch, expecting some sort of sarcastic joke back from them, but in no time at all we do indeed have officers on scene, waving their hats around and trying to shoo the massive bird out of the road. Picture the scene with the swan in Hot Fuzz - but in the middle of the city. \n\nThey have to quickly accept that they are not going to catch it (city boys vs. a six foot bird was not going well) but do eventually manage to chase it into a local park, and leave it at that. \n\nThus ends about 15 minutes of my working day - \n\n**TLDR - PEACOCK. PAEDO**\n\n",

We found one and decided to pull back and wait for the other to come out of his hiding spot.\n\nWhat most of us didn't know was that one officer decided to keep looking in the immediate area surrounding his service vehicle.

Literally less than 30 seconds later I see one of our vehicles tearing up this gravel road towards me. I ask on the radio if that is one of us and seconds after I don't get an answer I see a shirtless man looking at me as he's driving past.\n\nNow this is a barely 2-lane gravel road with irrigation canals on both sides. I pull a u-turn and when i manage to catch up with him he turns sharply and does a U-turn (followed by my u-turn again). Southbound he picks up speed to the point that I got dusted out and had to fall back a bit.\n\nAfter a few miles I see a larger sudden plume of dust. As I got closer I see that the guy had rolled the service vehicle, crawled out the window and then dove into one of the canals. The vehicle was completely demolished and laying on it's roof (at least of of the wheels ripped off if I remember right).

        "text": "At [the request of /u/krautcop](http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/2buml4/stuck_on_hospital_watch/cj93itt):\n\nDuring this incident, I worked at a police agency which had, as one of its responsibilities, backing the security department at the local hospital. We had a pretty collegiate working relationship with the hospital crew due to the frequency of calls.\n\nI was working with Mario and Joe. The hospital security staff consisted of a couple of pretty-fit guys and the nursing staff had several men and women used to scrapping it with patients; one of those nurses, Brock, had biceps the size of my skull, no joke.\n\nThe hospital security guys called us to the hospital on a mental patient being disorderly. Mario, Joe, and I arrived inside the emergency department. The emergency department was stretched along a long hallway with rooms all along the hallway. The emergency department had one lockable room for the mental health patients and the door to that room was at the intersection with another hallway.\n\nThe patient, a fit-looking younger guy, was standing in the hallway intersection yelling that he was not going back in the lockable room; the patient’s parents, a tired-looking couple, were standing near the patient trying to help the hospital staff convince the patient to return to the room Mario, approached the patient and tried to talk to him; he was trying to connect with the patient so that we would have some sort of basis to work with the patient to get him calm and back in to his room. Every time Mario would use one of the tricks that usually worked, it would calm the patient briefly until Mario would try to start to steer the conversation towards convincing the patient to go back in to the lockable room.\n\nThe patient finally decided that he was fed up, that he didn't want any part of what was going on, looked Mario in the eye, and said, \"I'm going to take that gun,\" pointed at Mario's gun, \"and shoot everyone in uniform in here,\" while he proceeded to point at each officer and security guard on the call (5 total, if I remember correctly). Well, this clearly raised the tension level in the hallway so Joe starts to line up next to Mario to be able to provide immediate assistance. Joe might have said something to the patient but I don’t really remember what set the patient off, just what happened next.\n\nThe patient swung at Joe. Joe ducked back but not enough to avoid the patient’s knuckles grazing his left cheekbone. The patient followed Joe’s momentum and started to press the assault.\n\nNow, I lettered in football in high school but I lettered as the water boy. I pulled out my best impression of a football tackle and shoved the patient into a corner in the hallway and slammed into him with my not-inconsiderable weight. Unfortunately for the hospital's accounting department, there was an IV pole with a drip regulator on it in between the patient and the wall. I recall hearing plastic and metal clattering to the ground as we rebounded back to the middle of the hallway.\n\nNeedless to say, the impact with, me, the IV pole, the wall, and the struggle to regain balance after the rebound changed the patient's channel and distracted him enough that everyone else was able to catch up and go hands-on. We officers, security guards, and two nurses landed on the guy with the patient struggling mightily; strangely enough, Brock was not one of the nurses on top of the patient’s limbs or hip bone. The patient was now laying face down in the hallway with someone clinging to each arm, one or two people on each leg, someone pushing down on his hips, and someone pushing on his shoulders each time he tried to move. I was hanging on to the patient’s right wrist. Even with 7 to 1 odds, this guy still had that uncanny mental health patient strength and a building sheen of sweat beginning to work in his favor; I can’t speak for anyone else but the sweat was starting to make me lose my grip on his strong arm.\n\nBrock returns to the pile up and suddenly I felt and heard the patient’s waistband moving (because of how the pile-up landed my left cheek was against the patient's right hip). I turned my head and saw Brock bare the patient’s right cheek and swab it with an alcohol swab. Next thing I knew, Brock’s hand was hovering over the swabbed area waiting for the patient to be still long enough to administer whatever medicine was in there. I concluded, just as Brock told everybody what he was trying to do, that the injection was a sedative. I friggin’ hate needles but I've never been so happy to see a giant fucking syringe so close to my face.\n\nAfter about a minute, a minute which seemed quite a bit longer, the sedative got to the patient's brain and calmed him down enough that the hospital staff were able to get him in to his room and strapped to his bed.\n\nAmazingly, the patient's family (mom, dad, siblings saw the whole thing) seemed relieved instead of upset at how we regained control, probably because he went into the room for treatment instead of off to jail.\n\nJoe was ok; he had a slight shiner where the patient’s knuckles connected with his cheekbone.",

        "text": "This is my first post here, so I will give a little background on my city.\n\nI work in a small pretty active city in Southern California.  It has four gang areas, which pretty much means the entire town is a gang area.\n\nI am working midnights on a Friday night.  My area partner, a seasoned veteran, gets a call for three of four individuals fighting out in front of their house.  Let's call him Max.  He is Asian, so his name isn't really Max.\n\nThis is not an unusual call for us on any day or night in our town.  We roll over there at a normal pace.\n\nAnother Officer Jose shows up to the call as well.  I take one look at Jose and I know something is up.  \"Are you ok?  You are sweating balls.\", I ask.  \"Fucker, I am crowning.  If you bump me too hard I'll probably shit my pants.  Fucking burrito gave me the bubble guts.\", Jose says.\n\nI laugh at him and ask, \"Why are you here then?  Go take your shit.\"  Jose replies, \"I dealt with his tweaker at this house last week.  It might go south.\"\n\nAs we are having this conversation, the homeowner walks up to us.  \"It's just my brother guys.  He is drunk and going to sleep it off.\"  I say, \"Fair enough, but do you mind if I go inside to make sure no one is dead?\"\n\nThe homeowner allows us in.  Officer Max takes the lead and I follow with Jose behind me.  As we are walking down the hallway I can hear some dude yelling from the rear bedroom, \"I am a god!  You don't even know my power!!\"  Uh oh.\n\nSo I take out my taser and hide it behind my back.  We enter the room and there is a gentleman standing on the bed.  I would describe him as a male white, 5' 10\", 170 pounds, blond hair, completely naked except for his sneakers and the pants around his ankles.  Oh yeah,  and his is completely tweaker sweaty.  He is just covered in sweat.\n\nI point my taser at his chest and intend to say, \"Police Department, relax or you are going to get tased.\"  What came out was, \"Police Depar-shit!\"\n\nSo I see this all in slow motion as this tweaker, with his pants around his ankles, leaps a good 7 feet at my partner.  Tweaker is on the bed and Max is short, so genitals are at head level.  Max's face contorts in horror as he uses his arms to avoid getting the full tea bag.\n\nAs this is happening, I am tracking the tweaker with my taser.  When both Max and tweaker go down in a pile I realize I am taser pointing Max.  So I chuck my taser over my shoulder and jump into the kerfuffle.  I get some \"friendly fire\" as Jose grabs the tweaker's arm and slips, probably due to the sweat lubrication, and elbows me in the face.\n\nIt wasn't too much of a fight, and it was over quick.  I had to bite my lip to not laugh as we were dragging the homeowners extremely uncooperative brother out of the house.  My jaw hurt where I got elbowed, but I had this image burned into my mind of Max almost getting chin nuts.  I really wished I had a camera going for that.\n\nWe get outside and Jose is sitting on top of the floppy tweaker and he is not looking good.  Remember he had a serious crap on deck.  Jose yells at me, \"Take over!\"\n\nSo I do.  I see Jose run to his car, hit the light and sirens and take off like a bat out of hell.  Luckily, the station is close.\n\nJose made it in time to avoid a change in uniform and the tweaker ended up self admitting to the hospital and no charges were filed.\n\nYou may ask why no charges were filed.  As soon as Sarge gets there, we get another call for a stabbing.  Priorities and burritos.",

        "text": "/u/Osiris32 requested the full version of this story from /r/ProtectAndServe. I thought it was a pretty funny story so here goes:\n\nI was cruising around the other day when a call comes out of two people following an auto theft suspect. They tell dispatch the suspect stole their car, their is an open case with another agency, and the suspect has a warrant. My partner Scott and I (separate that day) head towards where the call is.  Scott drives down one end of an alley and finds the reporting parties in a car following the suspect. The suspect is driving a big ass motorhome with two flat tires. \n\nTo say the reporting parties are over zealous is an understatement. They cut off the police cars and refuse to pull over as the cops are trying to pull it over. We also found out later that the motor home's tires were flat because they slashed them. \n\nAnyways Scott puts out that they are in the alley.  I happen to pull up at the end of they alley they are coming out of and see the front end of the motorhome. It's stopped so I am wondering if that's the one. The side door flings open and this short fat guy comes running out of it. Running is a generous word because he was waddling so slow I didn't realize it was a full on sprint for him. \n\nScott comes around the corner on foot and is screaming bloody murder at this guy to stop. The guy keeps running towards me though. At this point he's about 50 yards away and running next to a wall. I race up to him with my car and angle it so I cut him off. I stop my car about 5-6 feet in front of him.  He tries to use the bumper of my car to jump over the hood and escape. The only problem was he loses his footing and eats shit all over the hood of my car. \n\nI am laughing now and getting out of my car. He gets off the hood and tries to run back towards Scott who is now lowering himself to tackle the suspect. I run around the back end of my car to help, but I lose sight of them for a second. When I come around the car now all of a sudden I see the guy standing still and Scott on the ground. Except Scott is fully proned out and grabbing onto the guy's legs. He was going to tackle the suspect but slipped on some sand and ate it in front of him. The only thing he could do was grab onto the guys legs and hold on for his 8 seconds like a bull rider. \n\nI run up to them to give the guy a flying knee but he gets tackled from behind by another officer Alex. Alex and Scott start rolling around with this guy on the ground so I start coordinating other units to clear the motorhome since they have him in hand. They are wrestling around with this guy trying to get his hand behind his back. They finally manage to get him on his stomach and his hands behind his back through some monumental effort. Alex pulls out his cuffs and ratchets one end on. Scott looks over to Alex and tells him, \"Dude you just handcuffed me!\"\n\nAlex says, \"Oh shit.\"  Not knowing what to do with the other handcuff, he just slaps it on one of the suspects wrist and handcuffs Scott and the suspect together. I am dying laughing at this point and we eventually get him into custody.\n\nThe kicker is that the suspect looks at Scott and says, \"Hey Scott. I'm sorry I ran. \"  Scott dealt with the suspect a bunch of times about 8 years ago when he was a Cadet. \n\nIn the end the suspect ended up having 3 active warrants totaling over $100,000. ",

        "text": "Short and sweet today. I still haven't heard about the Pineapple calendar pictures - do you all still want to see them? Also, the next story should have some cool visuals too if I can find my old case file.\n\n___________________\n\nIt was still dark and decidedly colder than it should have been for the middle of July, but the briefing started on time: 0500 hours on the nose. \n\n\"Ok, this should be a quick one. This guy” a photo was passed around our tight circle, “has a warrant out for fail to appear on a distribution of crack cocaine charge.\" Kenny received then filed away his brief sheet after the last team member committed the target’s face to memory. \n\n\"Dude has a pretty bad criminal history: robbery, firearms, felony assaults, numerous drug arrests, assault on law enforcement, and he was acquitted on a capital murder in the city due to a lack of cooperative witnesses. We should assume he won't go easily and that he has drugs and weapons inside.\"\n\nI looked around to the other guys I was working with that morning. We had all been through warrant services like this a hundred times but I could tell no one in the group was going to be complacent today. It’s a good feeling knowing you might be walking into a firefight and that everyone with you could be trusted to cover your back. \n\nKenny ran over the various roles we’d need to cover – ram, shield, less lethal, medic – and when no one had any questions, we headed out to go wake up a bad guy. Our wagon train of cop cars proceeded from the abandoned parking lot into an apartment complex and Kenny’s voice crackled over the radio describing the specific building we’d be devoting our attention to. “Park anywhere along here, the one up this pipe stem, third on the right is the target.”\n\nWe all quickly exited our vehicles and I hefted the bulky ballistic shield out of my trunk and tucked it under my left armpit for the approach. We all filed in silently and I took my spot at the front of the line and nodded to Kenny that I was ready, gun drawn and at my side, for him to knock.\n\nTHUNK-THUNK-THUNK, “Police department with a warrant!” Kenny announced. I could hear footsteps approach the door then a pissed off voice from inside.\n\n“Who the fuck is it!”\n\n“POLICE WITH A WARRANT, OPEN THE DOOR NOW!” Kenny wasn’t messing around. \n\n“Aw, hell naw! You all mutha-fuckas aint getting’ in here!” The pissed off voice called back, clearly getting distant to match the sound of his retreating footsteps. \n\n“Ram up.” I said to the line behind me, not taking my eyes away from the door. \n\nOur ram guy moved up and lined up his shot, just below the door knob of the metal on metal frame door. It was going to be a pain in the butt to get through, that was obvious after the first attempt merely dented the door slightly. Three more, full bodied rams and the door flung open. I was first through, gun raised and issuing commands.\n\n“Police! Come out with your hands up!” I always get a little amped on entries, and my voice roared loud enough for my throat to still be sore an hour later. It’s nowhere near as bad as it used to be. I don’t get the adrenaline dump lows afterwards either. I guess that’s a good thing.\n\nI lined up on the wall looking down the long hall while my team quickly cleared the kitchen and living room just inside the small, two bedroom apartment. There wasn’t any movement from down the hall so I called out again.\n\n“Police! Come out now!” I could hear a woman yelling now – or maybe the more appropriate word is “bitching”? - and suddenly a man popped out from the back room, as though he had been shoved. He side stepped to catch his balance then looked back into the room with scorn. He was wearing a wife beater and boxers and immediately upon seeing him I ordered him to show me his hands.\n\nHe raised them slowly and I took a good look at his face, confirming he was our wanted target. “Keep coming towards me, slowly.” I had my gun’s rail light in the permanent on position and was watching him through the small “porthole” in the shield. \n\nHe reluctantly came forward but slowed a step as his face registered something wrong. He made a noise through his teeth, “Tsk!”, and his hand started to edge down to his waist line.\n\n“HANDS UP!” I yelled, wondering what he could possibly be hiding in the waist band of his boxers. I glanced down once he complied with another \"Tsk!\" and saw the reason for his maneuver: the fly of his boxers was unbuttoned and his manhood was flopping out of it - clearly he had felt the draft while he was walking towards me. \n\nI couldn’t help but chuckle. The situation was tense, but not so much that I couldn’t see the humor in it. “Go ahead,” I started, but had to stop to stifle a laugh. “Go ahead and put… put it... away.”\n\nThe man made another annoyed noise, “Tsk!” and rocked his shoulder to regain some of the thuggish credibility he had lost with his unintentional nudity. One hand shot down to tuck his member away and pull the cut in his boxers closed. “Man! What’d I even do! I ain’t do shit!” He complained after putting his hand back up.\n\nI didn’t answer. Instead I placed the shield down and holstered up to grab the man’s wrists to secure them in cuffs. \n\nThe woman who had been yelling came out of the room with her hands up a second later and I called her to me slowly, confirming the only other occupant in the place was her four year old son. We cleared the rest of the apartment, found a miniscule amount of marijuana (\"It's my cousin's friends! I swear!\"), and started preparations for transport to jail. \n\nAll the commotion had roused the four year old from his sleep but we elected to leave him in his mom’s room, watching SpongeBob. I high-fived him for the good taste in early morning TV and he seemed totally un-phased by the early morning intrusion by a team of officers wearing raid gear.\n\nOur prisoner pleaded with his girlfriend to say she loved him as he sat on the couch the couch while we lingered until warrant checks were run and some clothing was gathered to preclude another wardrobe malfunction. The woman wouldn’t look at, let alone talk to, her boyfriend which just enraged him more. “C’mon Tasha! You know I quit selling! I aint ‘bout that life no more!” \n\nI replied on her behalf. “Well, apparently you are if there’s a warrant out.”\n\n“Tsk! I just missed a bullshit court date. Y’all mutha-fuckers aint need to come bashing in my door for some petty shit!”\n\n\"We wouldn't have had to if you'd just answered it like a grown man!\"\n\nThe girlfriend interrupted our bickering. “Are you all going to get him out of here? I’m done with him.” The woman was rightly pissed at the whole situation, more so at him for being a deadbeat than us for smashing in her door. \n\n“Moving out!” Kenny called as he heaved his prisoner to his feet and exited the apartment. \n\nMy boss gave the woman his card. “If you want to file a claim for the door, the number’s on here. If he had answered it when we announced we were police, we wouldn’t have had to come in like this.”\n\n“Oh, don’t worry about that! I’m the one who shoved his dumb ass into the hallway so you could lock him up. He’s not gonna bring that crap up in my house!” She then pointed to the couch which had a pillow and crumpled blanket on it. “This is where I made him sleep last night! He can rot in jail now, for all I care.” \n\nI tried to close the door behind me as I left but it was too mangled to shut. I gave the woman a sheepish grin and shrugged my shoulders.\n\n“I’ll get it fixed… and change the locks.” She told me as she looked over the devastation. \n\n“Well, while you’re at the store, grab your guy some boxer briefs too. Next time we’re here, I don’t need to be seeing his junk flopping in the breeze again.” That got a laugh out of her.\n",

        "text": "I'm a felony probation officer. The agency I work at does field work and has the power to arrest, which is what this story is about. I cleared with the mods to post even though I don't ride in a squad car very often. Feel free to complain and I will humbly back out and leave the posting to the guys that do the real work.\n\nAs a little background to the scene my department is split into several different office sections due to the large size. The officers that share a hallway with me are all very close to each other and we can hear each other when we meet with probationers. We tend to nickname the felons that we are working with and share stories as a way to vent. \n\nThe woman in the office next to me (We’ll call her Shannon) was having one client that was being particularly difficult. He was avoiding coming in to his scheduled visits all week and generally displaying signs that we recognize usually means substance abuse. She somehow gets all the worst of our felons and she tends to take her phone calls on speaker when someone is really being a little shit so we can all enjoy the fiasco as it unfolds.\nAfter her last call with this guy she came into my office to vent. “Can you believe the bullshit he was giving me today to get out of coming in! I’ll bet you $20 that he is positive for cocaine.” \n\nTo which I replied “It’s not a bet if we both agree, I doubt you’ll find anyone but his mom who will take that bet.” That was the last I thought about him because I had a stack of my own clients to worry about.\n\nAbout 3 hours later I get a call from the lab Room where we store urine samples before shipping them to be drug tested at a real lab. I answered and hear “Hey this is Shannon, I’m in the lab room do you have a client or can you come here right now?” She never asks for help unless it is really important. “Be right there” I quickly reply and head over.\n\nNow keep in mind we also work in secured areas. Our hall is separated from the rest of the building by an unsecured lobby. We have to cross from my secured hall through the unsecured lobby where the felons wait to be seen back into a secured area to access even the copy machine. As I’m passing through I always look around, because safety first. You need to be aware who is watching you. The lobby was nearly empty at this point with only a large 6’5’’ white man sitting with what appeared to be his mother against one wall. I continue across and reach the lab room probably only a minute after she had called. \nShannon is standing next to the boxes we use to ship specimens to the lab for testing. She opens up one of the boxes and pulls out a probably 9’’ black knock off wizzinator. If you are unfamiliar with the wizzinator it is essentially a dildo with a bladder and pump. Her client was trying to fake a UA because of course he was positive for Cocaine. I see this thing and I lose it. \nI’m laughing hysterically. “OK Shannon you win that $20 this time.” \nShe is more looking concerned than amused. “He admitted to use after we pulled this thing off him. Can you help me with an arrest?”\n\nI reply “Of course.”\n\nAt this point I remember that there was only 2 people in the lobby. “You know what I think he may have left though, there was only one guy in the lobby.”\n\nShe cocks her head and says “No I don’t think he left, what did the guy in the lobby look like?”\n\nI pause “It was a bigger, tall, white guy…”\n\n “Against the wall?” she asks. I nod \n\n“That’s him.” was her only reply. I was in disbelief. I look at the enormous black cock she is holding with two gloved hands and look back at her. \n\nI stutter out “You’ve got to be kidding”\n\nStraight faced, “Nope” \n\nI lose it in hysterics again. \n\n“Cocaine is a hell of a drug” was the last thing I said as I left to call backup for her arrest.\n",

        "text": "So, like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/28r85f/ride_along_quiet_drinks_in_a_hotel_bar/) and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/28uu27/ride_along_dude_im_trying_to_sleep_here/), this is a story of a criminal justice conference.  Unlike the previous two, this one hails from Memphis Tennessee, in the year of our pasta lord 2011.\n\nYou should understand that the organization I belong to is mainly made up to college students.  Sure there are professional chapters that are made up of police officers, and there are numerous chapter advisers and professors who are still in the business or retired, but easily 2/3 of the membership are college age.  And with college comes, you guessed it, stupidity and inexperience.\n\nThe hotel we were staying at was a very large L shape, with the pool in the crook of the L and the main entrance at the point of the bend.  The large parking lot wraps around from short leg to long leg, with a big roundabout in front of the main entrance (even included a very nice fountain, WHICH WE DID NOT JUMP IN ON PAIN OF DEATH FROM THE ASSOCIATION LEADERSHIP).  Past the parking lot was a tall wrought-iron fence, facing the road that the hotel was on.  Past the tip of the long leg, on that same road was a BBQ place that took a very substantial amount of our money, and for good reason.  The shape of the parking lot plays into this story.\n\nNow, that main entrance was also the de facto smoking area, with a smaller one further down the long leg near the ballroom.  The main entrance eventually became the area where the students hung out and had their cigs, while the advisors hung out by the ballroom entrance.  There was no decree in this, it was just the way things formed themselves, such is the way of social dynamics.  The location of the advisors (and several off-duty cops) also plays into this story.\n\nIt was Monday evening.  First official day of the conference.  Today has mostly been taken up with academic and crime scene competitions.  Everyone is trying to drink quickly, because midnight is coming and we have a VERY hard and fast rule that drinking must stop 8 hours prior to the safety briefing the next morning, otherwise you are not allowed to shoot or compete in physical agility.  So at about 11:45, there is a run at the hotel bar on drinks, naturally.\n\nI'm outside, beer in one hand and Marb Smooth in the other, chatting away with my frat brothers and sisters, enjoying the warm air and being glad that I'm not home where it's 40 degrees and raining sideways, when the sound of rubber being peeled off a tire and laid down on asphalt shatters our reverie.  All heads (about 20 or so of us) snap around, to see a full-sized blue pickup tear out of a parking space on the short-leg side of the hotel, come roaring around the corner on the other side of the round about, miss the exit to the parking lot, and plow into two parked cars at near-highway speed.  The impact was very loud, and both of the cars that were hit jump sideways significantly, one popping up over a curb and winding up in a flower bed.\n\nThere was a moment of slightly-inebriated stunned silence.  Did we really just see that?  Then the truck, front caved in and steaming quite badly, grinds into reverse, drags itself out of the rear quarter panel of the first car, and tries to roar off in the direction it was still facing.  In other words, the exact opposite direction of the parking lot exit and the Way Out.\n\nThe truck was not long for this world, it's radiator smashed open and it's oil pan cracked, it was definitely breathing it's last.  It made it as far as the far end of the parking lot before giving a death rattle and dying.  By this time the shock had worn off, and everyone from the student area AND the adviser area ran over to see what the living fuck had just happened and why this guy had thought it a good idea to play demolition derby in the parking lot of a Double Tree.  The advisers, being closer, had a commanding lead.  And despite being from several different agencies (and time frames), they arrayed themselves in a formation that gave everyone visibility and access to cover.  It was rather impressive.\n\nUpon seeing a rather large crowd running towards him, however, the driver made the rash decision of trying to run himself.  However, his high BAC and lack of shoes made that pretty difficult, and he was tackled by several faster and more sober people.  I think he made it all of about 15 steps.  There was a man gate in the fence, which I think he was heading for.  Fifteen feet short, as if that would have stopped us from catching him anyway.\n\nThe police were called.  Ah, no need, there was an officer from the MPD already there, dropping off forms for ride alongs!  How exquisitely convenient.  The suspect, now held by two strong, young, and very angry men, was delivered into the officer's hands, along with many an overlapping tale of what had transpired.  Waving all of us away for the moment, the officer began his investigation, as we began talking among ourselves like the little squeaky birds in the Pixar short at the beginning of Monster, Inc.\n\nCome to find out, the suspect is *one of us.*  Oh, shit.  The temperature for the whole region must have dropped 10 degrees in an instant, the icy looks that kid got.  It was his first ever conference, it was his first ever trip outside his home state, it was his first trip ever *without his parents.*  21, on his own for the first time, and without the usual parental supervision, he had drank FAR too much on his own (BAC was something like 0.20) and decided that he really, really needed some BBQ.  So he hopped in the truck that his grandfather had let him borrow to come to the conference (if memory serves the kid was from Missouri, not that far away), and tried to drive over there.  In the process he destroyed the truck, the rental car belonging to a girl from a Delaware chapter, and the personal car of one of the advisors from a Minnesota chapter.  Oh, and broke the curb pushing one of the cars, ripped up several plants from the flower bed, and severely damaged a small tree.\n\nAfter being taken to jail, he called his grandfather, who apparently was so appalled at his grandson's behavior that he refused to bail him out.  So the kid sat there for the better part of a week, before being going to trial on DUI, hit and run, and reckless endangerment.  He was also very quickly kicked out of the association (the next day, in fact) and eventually expelled from his college.  Oh, and the rest of us made VERY sure to be careful about our own and others drinking for the rest of the event.\n\nTL;DR - Drunken idiots gonna drunken idiot, but it did not ruin the later run for ribs at The Rendezvous.",

        "text": "Another subreddit reminded me of this …. Little incident.\n\nI am well aware that police officers have to walk a fine line sometimes more than others.\n\nI was living on a collage campus in a large northern city.  \nBetween Frat parties and a freeway less than 50 yards away I never considered noise to be a factor.  \nMy lady and I lived in an older house that was converted into two apartments.  We had the top two floors.  The front door to the house was open to our level the lower level had an inner door.  So anyone walking in the front door could see and hear what was going on in our part of the house.   We worked different shifts so our weekends were special.   \n\nBeing young and not the go out and party types we rarely got out of bed before 3 or 4PM on weekends. \nMy lady was a bit vocal when we were spending quality time together.  Hell let’s be honest I can probably attribute some of my hearing loss to her.   But we had been living there for a year with no incidents so I never worried about it.  \nThe frat boys next door never even hung out rating cards or complained.  \n\nOne day my lady made a request.  She showed me how to cup my hand just so and told me she wanted me to spank her during our quality time.  I willingly complied and we were passing a weekend afternoon with each other.   When a loud banging on the front door ensued.  Note this was many years ago and the laws now are not what they were then.   It was the first time in over a year that anyone had knocked on the door but I was loath to leave bed and was still wrapped in a hazy state of contentment. \n\nAfter several more poundings on the door I heard some shouting and finally decided to investigate the cause of the new ruckus.  I donned a pair of shorts and hobbled down the steps to the main door.  \nI opened the door a bit a to see two police officers outside.  One older say mid-fifties with greying hair and bit of a gut.  The other officer was young not much older than I was.  Looking back I am guessing that it was a case of an vet leading a rookie for a while.   The vet scowled up at me as I lounged on the door frame in the small gap that I had allowed by cracking open the door.  \nBoth officers immediately on seeing a male tensed up.  I noticed but with no indication anything was amiss yawned out “Whats up guys?”\nOlder cop scowled at me and said “We got a call that there is something going on at this address.”\n“I am sure you won’t mind if we come in. “\nWith that he began to move forward towards the door and reached out and put his hand on the door. \nI don’t take well to this kind of thing.  He was trying to force his way into the house.  \nMy contented mood disappeared in an instant.  This pissed me off.  \nTo the officers that do their utmost to protect people in their areas understand that the take control of the situation kind of training has its draw backs.  Acting aggressive to a young man that moments before was having quality time with his lady is apt to illicit a similar response.\n   \nI put a foot behind the door and swung my left arm up in a arc and slapped the door at the top.  This allowed me to put my full weight on the door and short of tools was an effective barricade to entry. \nAnd said in clipped tones “As a matter of fact I would mind.” \nThe younger cops eyes widened a bit in surprise at my sudden movement and he rocked back a little bit. The older cop took his arm down from the door and scowled.  And snapped out “We want to talk to the lady.”  And we are not leaving until we do.  At this point little young arrogant me was still clueless to the nature of this unwelcome visit.  \nI rolled my eyes and drawled obnoxiously  “Fine stand out there all day if you like It doesn’t bother me any.”  \nThe older cop took several breaths to struggle for control of his temper visibly trying to calm down.  \nYoung and dumb, pissed off and perceiving I had the upper hand I smiled.   Still utterly clueless as to what was going on but the contempt coming off the older cop was enough to incite my lower instincts to be a pain in the ass.   Not too different from many barely 20 somthings.   \nThe older cop was just about at his limit.\nWE. WANT. TO. MAKE. SURE. THE. LADY. IS. OK. Each word was bitten off by the frustration that was rolling through him.  \nThe light finally went on. They thought I was beating my partner!!!!!\nUnderstanding had the effect of settling much of my riled temper.  My smile got a little broader as I realized that the older widow that lived down stairs probably heard my enthusiastic spanking  and with the enthusiastic applause from my lady reaching bat stunning levels,  jumped to the wrong conclusion.  The younger Cop had been watching my face and knew something was off.   His eyes wandered over the ten inch strip of me that was exposed by the open door.   Towseled hair, bite marks on the neck, and nail marks on the chest.  Shorts, on a weekend.  His light bulb went off.   You could track the progress of the thought across his mind by the expression on his face.   He smiled large.  He started to chuckle and covered his mouth with his hand and turned away.  \nI nodded and started to turn my head to call upstairs when older cop reached for the door again.  \nI was right back into pissed off mode again.  The door moved to less then 4 inches open with my feet on either side of it as I glowered at the older cop.  “The door says open!!” he almost shouted.\nI looked him straight in his hazel eyes knowing that they would be leaving in a minute but immature enough to not be able to resist a final dig.  \"I. Will. Close. The. Door. Anytime. I. want.\"\nAt this point the younger cop reached out and touched him lightly on the shoulder to get his attention.  Older cop jerked his shoulder away and the younger cop stepped back\n \nI pulled my head back from the door and called up to my lady. “It’s the police they want to talk to you.”\nA shocked “What?” drifted down the stairs. \nMy grin broadened and I am sure you could hear laughter in my voice as I called out. “It’s the police they think I am beating you and they want to talk to you.”  I said loudly enough for heads to pop up in the windows of the frat house next door.  Older cop leaned forward at the waist to make it clear he was not going to make another attempt at forcing the door and called out.  “Miss are you ok?”\n“Tell them I am fine!” she yelled.\n  \nI could hear the mortification in her voice as her light bulb came on as to what had happened. \nI opened the door a little so they would be able to her the response to what I was going to say next.  \nI plead the stupidity and arrogance of youth.  \nI called up all sweet and sugar… “I did they want to hear it from you!”\nIn my head I could see her beet red in embarrassment heading rapidly to purple when older cop called up “Miss can you come down here please?”  The gasp from upstairs at the idea of having to look them in the face with them knowing we were having sex told me she had gone all the way to purple.\n\n  She yelled down “I am NOT coming down.  I am fine! Go away!”  Her muffled tone could only be caused her covering her face with her hands in abject embarrassment.    I glanced at the younger cop and he was straight up chuckling.  The older cop stepped back from the door in frustration.  “Miss I need to talk to you. “  he called out.  The windows of the frat house next door were now standing room only. \nPuzzlement clearly written on his face.  This was not going the way it usually did.  \nHis light bulb had not come on yet.  \n“No!” came the tormented cry from above“Go away I am fine” \nYounger cop leaned forward and said something low in older cops ear.\nHis light bulb went off \nHe looked at my neck and then my chest.\nHe got mad but he also came out of aggression mode.\nWithout a word he turned and started to stomp off.\nYoung cop shot me a wink and started to follow him.\nAbout half way to the street he spun back and snapped “Keep it down!”\nAnd resumed heading for the squad car.\n \nI closed the door and walked upstairs and into the bedroom.  I had had my pleasant afternoon shattered and felt I had the right to be at ground zero when the full realization hit her. \nAs I entered the bedroom she was lying on her side facing the wall.  Her face covered by her hands.\n“This is so embarrassing” she groaned burying her face into my chest.  \nAbout then the police car pulled away from the curb.\nGentle at first but gathering rapidly and growing like a storm on the horizon, applause began to cascade in the open bedroom windows from the frat house.  \nThey had heard everything.  \nMy lady stiffened as understanding coursed over her. \nHer shriek of horror was long and foretold our need to move soon.\nAhh to be young again.

        "text": "Thursday special! Also, I found the Pineapple calendar and it's great. I want to scan the pictures in and post them but wanted to make sure it was kosher with /u/Forensicunit first. Maybe next week?\n\n_______________________\n\n\nAs I’ve said before, I’m a legacy cop. My dad retired with 30+ years under his belt and is still involved in the local police community in his new job. He made lots of friends over his years, guys that see my name tag and say “Are you EMR? As in the son of EMR Senior?” It’s great to hear the stories they share about my dad, things he would never have shared with me growing up but are part of the every-day routine I’ve now signed up to be a part of. The flip side is that it seems for every two of those guys, I run into a “You’re EMR Sr.’s son, right? Your dad was an asshole” guy comes along. My dad’s stint at the academy and in IA left a wake of malcontents I still have to work next to every once in a while. \n\nI had just transferred from a daywork shift to an evening shift and was trying my best to blend in with the white painted cinder block wall in the roll call room. I had begun to make a name for myself on my old squad and was getting used to the day-to-day work being a street cop entailed but I knew to this new group, I’d be the rookie who knew nothing. I was fine with that role and new I’d be stuck in the slowest area at the station – a dreaded chunk of land wedged between an interstate and several large throughways, dotted here and there with million dollar homes and, just for the ironic juxtaposition, a sprawling level three trauma hospital complete with the state’s largest mental institution. Working that area meant either a long day of catering to the rich estate owners complaining about the way the creek floods in their multi acre yard or running from minor emergency metal patient escapes to walk in rape reports at the hospital. \n\nI was waiting for the dreaded area assignments when an even worse announcement was made by the grizzled lieutenant reading the boards. \n\n“Oh, I almost forgot: everyone, welcome EMR to the squad. He just transferred from daywork on the other shift and he comes with a heap of praise from his bosses. You might recognize his name – his dad is EMR senior!” The lieutenant was obviously a fan of my dad, due to his jubilant delivery of my lineage. I scanned the rest of the crowd to get a feel for their attitude towards me and noticed a few squinty-eyed faces of ire meeting my gaze. I greeted the group with a smile and timid wave.\n\nThe lieutenant banished me to the rookie zone, as expected, and I waited for the majority of the squad to file out of the room before standing to make my own way to my awaiting chariot. As I walked out, the lieutenant intercepted me just before the door. \n\n“Your dad was a hell of a guy. I went through the range when he was an instructor there.” He shook my hand with a firm grip and seemed genuine in his praise for my dad. I equated it to his haircut: obviously he was prior military. During his stint at the academy, my dad decided to make the training regimen more in line with a boot camp than its prior resemblance to a summer camp. The only guys who voiced an appreciation to the hard-nosed version of training seemed to be former military.\n\n“Yeah, it’s a mixed bag of feelings towards him from those of you who went through his range.”\n\n“Oh, don’t worry about those guys. They’re all pussies. Your dad was firm but fair - and a hell of a shot. You got a second for a quick story?” He seemed eager to share so I nodded. \n\n“You see, most of the guys back in my class had never even shot a gun, let alone been drilled the way your dad was doing things. There were guys who were nervous as all get out, jerking the trigger and anticipating their shots and whatnot, and your dad would come creeping upon them and slap them in the back when they screwed up! It was great!”\n\nI failed to see how getting pushed in the back while concentrating on shooting accurately would ever be “great” but I just smiled and nodded the lieutenant along. \n\n“So, anyways, this one time we’re shooting in a relay at some reactive steel, the kind that swings around when you hit it. The steel range wasn’t on the normal side of the range; it was off to the side and into another berm. Well, there’s two lines of us, all formed up, and it’s kind of a competition to see which line can finish first. There comes this point where the guy at the front of my line, a dude from the city who’d never shot a gun prior to the academy, is up against a guy who was in Korea and was a real crack shot. The army vet draws and fires quick as lightning PING! and the other guy knew the pressure was on. He’s sitting there, all concentration and sweaty brow, pulling the slack out of the trigger when your pops walks up and kicks his leg to widen his stance like he taught us. Well, gun-shy guy reactively pulls the trigger and pops off his round way off target, off to the right of the steel by a good ten yards or so. Well, his round skips off some metal junk they got piled up over there, ricochets up into the air, and BANG! pops right into the big lights up on the electric pole above us. We’re all staring there, our jaws hanging open, some of us laughing at the craziness of that shot and the guy turns around after holstering up. He’s got this big, shit-eating grin on and yells, ‘That’s gotta be worth two points, right?’ which makes us all start cracking up. \n\nI nodded in approval at the absurdity of the picture he was painting. \n\n“So, we’re there laughing at this dope, at the fact the range is a little darker than it was a second ago, and your pops, he’s fuming, you can tell. He yells at everyone to shut the hell up, and then draws his own weapon – these old .38 revolvers we used to carry – and levels it down range. I look at what he’s about to do and realize, ‘Shit, he’s not even pointing it at the target!’ Your dad is aiming dead on at the same pile of crap the dude had just shot by accident. Sure as shit, he fires his revolver, PING! the round hits the metal trash, ZIP! up it goes, straight into the same God damned light! It was the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen!”\n\nI tried to look impressed and quietly said “Wow.”\n\n“Ok, this is the best part. Your dad, cool as a clam, holsters up and slowly turns around to us. Dude’s not even smirking; he’s keeping his shit totally professional. He looks around at us, all scowling and angry and says, ‘Now shut the hell up and get back to shooting.’ He walks straight through us and stands back at the back of our lines, staring down range, hands crossed behind his back, waitin’ for us to get over our shock and start shooting again. It was the greatest, man. Let me tell you.”\n\n“Wow, that’s pretty awesome. I’ll have to ask him if he remembers that.” It was my usual response to those stories that came tricking in and usually my dad answered that no, he didn’t remember them at all. The lieutenant shook my hand again, welcomed me once more, and made me promise to say hi to my dad for him before letting me make my way to my cruiser again. \n\nI made it as far as the gas pumps out back before I got stopped again, this time by an old MPO, MacDonald, who had a checkered reputation at the station. \n\n“EMR, huh? How’s your dad these days?” He was filling up his cruiser and smoking a cigarette at the same time – shockingly reckless to me but I played it cool and ignored it.\n\n“Oh, he’s good I guess. Haven’t talked to him in a week or so. Liking his new gig out at the Western District.” I hoped that would be the end of it but wasn’t so lucky.\n\n“Good, good. Western is slow though. He’s probably running those poor guys ragged if he’s half the jerk he was back in the academy.”\n\nGreat, another former recruit of his. The odds placed the next quip to be decidedly more negative than the last I endured. MacDonald took a long drag of his cigarette (there were a lot of officers who were grandfathered out of the no-smoking clause imposed on us newer guys) and flicked the cherry-red butt away into the parking lot. \n\n“Yeah, your pops was a tyrant back in the academy. I think my class was the first one he ran. I went in thinking it was going to be easy, like my recruiter told me. Then, first day, we’re all lined up and he comes storming into the gym, all red faced and spitting mad. He got up in my face – don’t know why he picked me out – and grilled me for a good thirty seconds about how big a slob I was.”\n\nI bit my lip in the awkwardness of the silence following his account, looking for a way to slink away and not be judged by my dad’s actions. \n\n“Anyway, he ended up being ok. Some of the guys cracked and quit because of him. Some of them were my good buddies. But I guess that was his point, to get the weaker guys out early. Shit, if you can’t take getting yelled at by a guy in the academy, what’re you going to do when some piss-drunk asshole is mother-fuckering you in a bar? Right?”\n\n“Yeah, I guess.” I added a bit of nervous laughter to illustrate my discomfort in the conversation. \n\n“So I made it out and was fat, dumb and happy on my squad up North-side. I’m sitting there one day in roll call, oblivious to the goings on of the brass, and in walks your dad. Holy shit, I about stood up and took off running. I was so scared of that asshole I almost crapped my pants. I knew I was about to be in a world of hurt but I was the only one who knew of his antics in the academy. Everyone else is all happy-go-lucky and you know what? He’s right there with them!”\n\n“Yeah, I think that whole academy thing was a face he put on. I never knew him to be that bad at home.”\n\n“Well if he was pretending, he should’ve won an Academy Award because he was believable. Anyway, we get out and right off the bat I’m sent to a rabid possum call. Now, I’ve never been to a rabid animal call, but I know I’m supposed to shoot it, whatever it is, so it doesn’t go around biting people. I pull up and I’ve got some guy with me, barely any more time on than me, and we know we’re about to go into something we don’t usually deal with. Knock at the door and it’s opened by this super-hot MILF. I mean she’s in a nighty, hair down, enough leg showing to get your gears turning a little, y’know? She invites us in and tells us the offending critter’s in the basement and shows us the way. I’m all, ‘Thank you ma’am, this won’t be a problem for us, we’ll have you fixed in a minute’ and I’m hoping she picks up the double entendre I’m dropping with my stress on the word ‘fixed.’ We go creeping down the wooden stairs into this unfinished basement – poured concrete walls with some of that pink insulation tacked up. The little bastard is walking around in a circle in the middle of the laundry area, making this God awful croaking noise.”\n\nI was wondering at this point when the shoe was about to drop and my dad made his entrance playing the jerk role, but MacDonald continued. \n\n“So, I glance back up and shrug my shoulders at the other guy – I don’t know what the hell we’re supposed to do and neither does he apparently. We creep down the last couple steps and the possum sees us. It rears up and screeches at us. I would’ve crapped my pants for the second time that shift if we weren’t still a good twenty feet away. He’s giving me a clear shot though, so I’m grateful. I draw out my gun, and point it at this demon spawn. At this point in my career I’ve only ever shot a deer or two, never a friggin’ rabid possum, so I figure ‘Shoot it in the head’, right? I’m pulling back the slack when the door up the stairs opens and I look up to see your dad standing there. He’s all, ‘What the hell are you doing?!’ and I’m like, ‘Putting down this possum, what’s it look like?’ He comes stomping down and pushes my gun down, tells me to holster up. My ass is puckered, expecting him to tear me a new poop-hole any second but he’s actually cool about it. He tells me, ‘We don’t need a round bouncing around these walls and hitting one of us’ and I realize how dumb that would’ve looked. So I holster up like he tells me to, and wonder how the hell we’re going to get the little guy outa the basement? I mean, it’s not like we can go and grab him and carry him out.”\n\nI was genuinely intrigued at this point and happy this story wasn’t going the way I had thought.\n\n“So I’m trying to figure out what to do but before I can do anything, your dad walks over and picks up this shovel that’s leaning against the wall. I don’t even see it coming, he moved so quickly, but before I know it he’s smashing the stupid possum on the head! Blood’s flying everywhere! And the thing’s curling up and making that croaking noise and he’s smashing away! It was the most violent thing I’d seen to that point in my career and I was in shock. Your dad finishes the dirty work, hands the bloody shovel to me says ‘Don’t get any blood on you’ and walks away. He goes, ‘Tell the lady upstairs to give you a trash bag’ as he’s walking up the steps. I was scared of your dad before, but after that I realized he was such a badass that I should be scared of him for an entirely different reason. Best supervisor I ever had.”\n\nI couldn’t envision my dad being that violent but was appreciative the story didn’t end with me having to apologize on his behalf. MacDonald made me promise to say hi for him as well and I started my shift with my new squad, content that at least a couple new squad-mates would have my back when things got crazy.\n",

        "text": "This story takes place about two years ago, so around 2012. I had recently gotten the bug to look into LEO as a career, and on the advice of the Lt. over my current employers area, I turned in a ride along form downtown.  I was to meet my officer at the local substation of the PD, which shared a building with the FD for the area as well. After meeting some officers, I got in the car with Chris and we were off. Immediately upon getting in the car, I was looking around. I'm not sure what made him tell me the specifics but the officer started just spitting out information for the evening.\n\n\"I carry a Glock 19 on my belt, a Ruger on my left ankle, this is the button that unlocks the rifle, it's safety is here, and this button calls the cavalry in case something happens.\"\n\nAn interesting night already. I told him about my interest in becoming an officer and he was more than happy to answer questions for me. we spent the first few hours chasing the radio, from an attempted suicide that was already well under control, to a call for assistance with a traffic stop, one that had resulted in an arrest for an open warrant. All in all, it was a pretty fun night so far. Once the night started to slow down, we went back to the substation and sat around for a bit while Chris checked his email and told a few stories with the other officers. We were soon back on the road, out of area, so he could show me some other areas, and hopefully get into some trouble. We had just rolled past a house with a few people standing around outside when Chris told me that was a known shot house. He explained that a shot house was a house where they would sell liquor by the shot to anyone in the neighborhood. Interesting enough. The radio lit up.\n\n\"Charlie 23\"\n\"23\"\n\"Steakhouse reports subjects intoxicated and unwilling to leave\"\n\"23 10-4\"\n\nChris taps on his computer for more information. A local steakhouse reported that they had a group in the bar who were now drunk and were refusing to leave.\n\n\"That's right up the road\"\n\nWe hear the radio light up as two more units are requested by dispatch for the call, but they are both about 3 miles out. As we get to the parking lot, and start to pull in, we see that we are the first ones on the scene.\n\n\"Alright, the goal here is to not start a bar fight\" Chris said.\n\n\"I've got your back as best as I can.\" I replied.\n\nWe pull to a stop and see this mountain of a man screaming at other people gathering around outside, the screamer being held back by a smaller, UFC looking guy who has him in what looks to be a standing Full Nelson. This guy isn't going anywhere, and is slowly going to his knees. We get him somewhat calmed and find out the guy holding him back is his friend. Chris gets the man calm enough to talk to as backup arrives. \n\n\"Listen man, these people just want you to pay and leave, are you going to do that, or do I need to arrest you?\"\n\n\"Fuckin. Man. I don't know, God Dammit, lemmiegorightnowillfuckingbeatyourassilovemykidsimjusthangingouthere\"\n\n\"Alright, you're going to jail.\"\n\nThe man gets cuffed and put in the car, and we are off to jail.\n\n\"You sons of bitches, I wasn't even doing nothing!\"\n\n*he starts bawling*\n\n\"I'm so sorry man, I love you guys. I WOULD DIE TWO TIMES A DAY FOR YOU GUYS.\"\n\nChris tells him to just shut up.\n\nWe get to the jail, make our way to intake, and the deputies pretty much shove him in a cell, one with a solid door with a closed porthole to look in. We can hear him screaming and yelling, beating on the door. Suddenly, after 5 minutes or so of him raising hell, he goes quiet. We all look at each other, when we hear the toilet flush.\n\n\"He's going to sleep now\" a deputy chimes up.\n\nSure enough, he took a piss and was now passed out on the cot.\n\nHe was charged with some \"being drunk related charge\" (I don't remember what\" and since he had not paid his bar tab before he was arrested \"Defrauding an innkeeper\", which is my states version of not paying for food or beverages. \n\nThis was the last stop for us this night, and I was dropped back off at the station to drive home. The drive home took me about 10 minutes, and it was during that 10 minutes, that recapping everything that happened, from being called to a house where a young girl had reportedly tried to kill herself, to sitting around the station shooting the breeze with other officers, to riding alone through the bad parts of town, to being told there was a possibility of being shot at, finishing up with the feeling of being the first ones on the scene of a potential bar fight, I knew that being a police officer was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. \n\nI enrolled in community college, networked, and here, two years later, I start the academy at the beginning of August.\n\nHope you enjoyed this story, I have one or two more anecdotes from subsequent ride alongs I will try to get posted before the academy.\n\n",

We tow heavy boats and trailers because we're the county and we house all the dive team, water patrol, atv, snowmobile, mobile command, etc, etc. We dont tow things all the time, but we do drive on and off roads regularly. \n\nAbout a year before I was even eligible for hire we drove nice 1500's and police package impala's along with Canyons. We miled out all Impala's and all but one 1500. We can put in what vehicles we want for replacement through our supervisor (who thinks on the same brainwave as we do), but ultimately fleet and our sister department, the parks, have a bigger say.  Since parks is going ape shit with this \"Green fleet\" idea our requests for trucks didnt get noticed. So what do they give us? Ford motherfucking *Hybrid Fusions*. All the older workers are furious were (and still are) furious with the decision to give us these sedans.\n\nThankfully, however, our supervisors are too. They are pretty slack on why things get damaged because they know these vehicles do not help us do our job.\n\n Since we got these vehicles every. single. one. has been to fleet for broken shit multiple times. Skid plates, bumpers broken off, popped tires, door dings, lifted lightbars, damaged undercarriage, transmission issues, and engine issues. They most recently replaced an equinox that we had with a 2014 fusion. We had that vehicle for all of two weeks before it had to be *sent back to the ford dealer because of a catastrophic failure of the transmission.* we have yet to see it return. At the current rate, we're going to cause more damage to these poor  fwd, low clearence, no spot light sedans than what they're worth.  We dont try to damage our vehicles. We need them.. even if they cant do what we want.  The other day there was a bit of a heated discussion between supervisors and fleet about these vehicles.\n\nWe, again, put in for trucks for replacement we're bidding for F150's or 1500 Diesels. Both are good options for our line of work.\n\n\nAnd this is why you dont let non-law enforcement personnel choose vehicles for law enforcement.",

Like any man would do, he pulled over to the edge of the highway and prepared for his trek to the nearest gas station.\n\nUnfortunately, Perry didn't make it far. He failed to do what we're all told in elementary school; look both ways before crossing. Halfway across the road, a car came a bit too close to Perry.

Needless to say, Perry did not return from work.\n\nMy grandfather was one of the first on the scene, and the last to leave.

Like any true cop would do, he grabbed the shoes and shoved them in his trunk.\n\n\nYeah, I never said he was a great cop. But they were nice shoes. ",

        "text": "The story starts with me sitting in my car near a freeway entrance ramp. I was standing by in preparation to shut down the ramp. A motorcycle charity event benefiting a children's hospital was going to be using the freeway and along it's route, the ramps would be closed so the group could stay together. \n\nAs I'm sitting near the ramp, I'm flagged down by a concerned motorist. I could tell that she was shook up about something. The driver told me that up on the bridge deck a woman was standing, just staring out into the distance with a vacant stare. I told the driver I would check it out and headed that way.\n\nAs I pull up, I saw her and just knew I was looking at a jumper. She was crying and staring out at the freeway below her as if contemplating when to go for it. I called out my location and requested another unit. \n\nNow would be a good time to explain that this bridge is under construction. They have already replaced half the bridge deck and have the traffic all shunted to one side while the replace the other. The off ramp is still under construction as well. They have a temporary barrier blocking access to the ramp from the bridge deck. The barrier is about three feet high. Along the bridge deck is three foot concrete walls and a six foot fake wrought iron fence. The ramp is only partially completed. The floor is there but not paved yet. There are no barriers on the sides, just a flimsy 2x4 railing to warn the construction workers where the edge is. On one side of the ramp is the freeway, the other is train tracks. It's about 60 feet from the tracks to the top of the ramp/ bridge deck.\n\nThe woman is standing on the bridge deck at the temporary barrier. I stop about 30 feet back from her and get out of my car. The woman sees me and starts edging away from me along the barrier. I try to ask her whats wrong and she says something about not wanting the police. From the way she's talking and edging closer to the corner of the ramp and bridge deck, I get a pit in my stomach. I know where this is heading. I call for my other unit to pick it up. I take a step back from her and lean back against the barrier to try and give her comfort that I don't want to harm her and just want to talk to her. I try and engage her in a conversation and build rapport. Nothing works. She just cries and keeps looking at the traffic and at me. I just know she's trying to figure out if she has time to make it to the edge before I could reach her. \n\nShe notices the second unit arriving, jumps the barrier, and makes a run for the edge of the off ramp (towards the train tracks and away from me). I hop the barrier right behind her and grab her about four feet from the edge. We begin wrestling. She's stronger than I thought. I'm sure she had an enormous adrenaline dump from trying to kill herself. I'm trying to wrestle her away from the edge and get her under control. My back up unit saw what was happening and jumped the barrier and with his help we were able to wrestle the woman to the  ground. \n\nOnce on the ground, the woman continued struggling and trying to get up and towards the edge. While we are fighting with her, she's yelling things like \" I don't want to live\" \"just kill me\" \"shoot me in the head\". \n\nHer hands were under her body, and knowing she wanted to die, and not knowing if she had a weapon, my back up performed multiple closed handed strikes to her upper arms/ shoulder to gain control of the woman's hands. We were able to get her handcuffed. \n\nOnce we had her under control, we stood to assess her for any injuries. During the struggle she had cut her lip. She refused to talk to us other than asking us to shoot her. We were only able to figure out who she was by locating a ticket for operating a vehicle under the influence from another local agency in her purse.\n\nThat's when I hear it. From a car on the roadway I hear a voice. \"I saw it. I saw it all. Ya'll mother fuckers beat her for no reason. She didn't do nothing. You just beat her cause she's black. She just wanted to get away from you.\"\n\nAt the same time I hear that, the woman who had flagged me down originally drove up again and was almost in tears thanking us for checking on the distraught woman and saving her. \n\nWe had EMS come and check on the woman who had tried to jump. They transported her to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nI return to the station to begin my report. I'm working on my report when the dispatcher lets me know that the other motorist had just called to file a complaint on us. She filed a complaint saying that we beat a woman for no reason other than she was black. \n\nI am forever thankful for the woman who flagged me down. Without her caring for a random stranger, I would never have known that a woman was not more than 150 yards from me, ready to end her own life. Because of one person's kind heart, we were able to save a woman's life. ",

The WC knew me by name and would usually ask me who I wanted to ride with. I would usually just pick whoever was next up on the ridealong rotation.\n \nThis night I was riding with one of the new officers, he was fresh out of Field Training and I was his first ridealong. Earlier in the night the officer had arrested somebody and we transported them to our jail. When we got there, the officer took his gun out of his holster and put it in his trunk, because no weapons are allowed in the jail. \n\nFast forward a couple of hours and a couple of low priority calls and we were doing a patrol check at a gas station. As the officer was talking to a couple of the employees, I looked down and noticed that his weapon was not in his holster. At that point I was trying to decide if I wanted to stop him and tell him right then, pull him aside and tell him, or just wait until he was done and we were walking back to the car. Due to the circumstances, I ended up deciding to wait. As we were walking back to the car I said, \"you might want to get something out of the trunk,\" and he looked at me with a confused look on his face. I tapped his holster as I walked next to him and he finally realized his mistake and said, \"I've never done that before I swear!\"",

        "text": "Went long!\n\n__\n\n\nSally scratched an itch on the back of her neck and shifted her weight awkwardly from one foot to the other. She bore a one-nostril raised, skeptical eyed expression as she scanned the passing daylaborers for a face she knew. \n\nHer face lit up when she noticed one man, a short Guatemalan lugging a backpack filled with tools. “Amigo!” She hollered at him. He saw her and his eye roll was obvious even from our vantage across the parking lot.\n\nSally was undeterred though. She rushed up and wrapped her arm around her amigos back; getting close enough you’d think the two were a couple. Even to a casual observer, though, it was obvious the Guatemalan wanted nothing to do to her and he recoiled at her touch. She was smiling a toothy smile as she leaned in and asked him something quietly. He reacted by jerking his body away from her violently and cursing at her in Spanish before shaking his head and walking away. \n\n“Screw you them, pendejo maricón! You a gay anyway!” Sally had a rudimentary Spanish vocabulary at best but knew the words that would cut the most. \n\n“I guess he didn’t want that ass tonight.” Biggs observed from the driver’s seat. He usually drove due to “car sickness” but I had my doubts. \n\n“Or was insulted by her rates.” Sally was a crack addict and stuck out like a sore thumb. She towered over her potential johns and was one of the few black residents in the barrio. She had scabs all over from bouts of scratching and was always dressed in a disheveled state. Her hair shot out at odd, unmanaged angles as though she was cosplaying some obscure Anime character and she spit at the man’s back as he continued his trudge back home. \n\nShe turned from her once-friend-now-foe and began scanning faces again.\n\n“She’s got to score soon, man. Look at how she’s tweaking.” Biggs observed again, punctuated with a sunflower seed spat out his half opened window. We were hoping to catch one of the suppliers in the neighborhood and when we saw how Sally was acting, we knew it was only a matter of time before she led us to our big fish. \n\nI cracked my window and took a quick scan of the surroundings, checking to make sure no one was paying us too much attention. The cool autumn air wafted in the scent of ethnic food being cooked for dinner and people mulled about, paying us no more mind than they usually did. Our unmarked car was as much a staple in the neighborhood as the drunks we watched frolicking in the gas station parking lot near where Sally was peddling her wares. \n\nSally probably hadn’t even registered our presence and confirmed that assumption when she spotted a black, late model Lincoln pull into the drug store parking lot across the street from her. She squealed her crack-head anthem of joy and bolted across the street without even checking for oncoming traffic. A work truck had to jam on its brakes to avoid striking her but she barely noticed. \n\n“I’m thinking this is going to be our guy.” Biggs was looking for a promotion to Captain Obvious that evening. \n\nSally slowed to a slow, sultry stroll, one hand on her swaying hip, the other frantically squishing down her out of control hair. She wriggled her shoulders like a cobra luring a rat to dinner before leaning into the open window of the Lincoln. Her torn-jean covered butt bounced in the air with nervous energy for a moment before she suddenly stood erect, periscoping her surroundings over the Lincoln for anyone who might ruin her chance at a fix. She glanced right over us then bent at the waist again. \n\n“How does she not see us?” Biggs asked. \n\n“There’s no accounting for stupid.” I replied.\n\nA second later and the deal was done. Sally pocketed a handful of presumed crack and blew a kiss at the Lincoln as it drove off. I tried to get the tag number but it was gone before I could focus my binoculars. \n\n“Oh well, I guess Sally is getting stopped.” Biggs eased the car out of the spot and pulled the few hundred yards across a street and parking lot to Sally as she made her bee-line for her apartment. \n\n“Hey Sally. Whatcha got there?” Biggs asked out his window as he rolled alongside her at her manic “about to get high” pace.\n\n“Huh? Me? Got? Nothin.” She didn’t make eye contact or slow her pace; instead she kept her eye on the prize and trudged towards her home. \n\n“I’m pretty sure you got something in your back pocket there.” Biggs bluffed her, deliberately calling her attention to a pocket other than the one she was holding her drugs in. \n\n“Nuh uh. You can check it.” She stopped and raised in her arms in the fashion she was accustomed to from her multiple arrests.\n\nBiggs parked and got out, sliding his puncture proof gloves on while approaching Sally. I stood on guard nearby, covering our rear in case of an errant drunk or someone with a bad agenda decided the poorly lit common area we were stopped in was a good place for an ambush. \n\n“You have any guns on you? Knives? Needles? Grenades? Anything that’ll hurt me?” Biggs asked.\n\n“Nope, nothing.” Sally smacked her lips on the “P” in “nope.”\n\n“Any drugs or other contraband you’re not supposed to have?” He questioned from behind her, hand hovering over her waist in preparation for the pat down.\n\nSally hesitated and looked around as her rock tumbler of a mind digested the prickly question posed to her. “I don’t think so.” Her finished product was not as smooth as she had hoped.\n\nBiggs took an exaggerated pause. “You don’t think so or you don’t?”\n\n“I, uh… I don’t. Yeah, no. I don’t have anything.” I guess she hoped her purchase had miraculously dissolved into her thigh or something.\n\nBiggs gave her a quick pat and stopped on the bulge in her front pants pocket. “What’s this? Feels like crack.” He made the last part a statement and followed it up by shoving his hand into her skin-tight jeans ([plain feel doctrine, good street cop tool]( http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/plain-feel-doctrine/)) and pulling it out a second later with the three crack rocks Sally had just purchased in his grasp. He made an accusatory expression at her and let the silence linger while Sally stuttered over her words, attempting to figure out a plausible excuse.\n\n“That’s just some… it’s wax… or rocks I found.” Was the best she could come up with.\n\n“Wax or rocks? You need to pick one, I think.”\n\n“Rocks then. Like, pebbles. I found them.” She became more confident in her assertion.\n\n“They’re rocks, alright. But these rocks go for about twenty a piece.”\n\nSally mulled over her next move. She was about to stumble into check mate and she could feel it. “Ok. I bought that from a dude.” She sighed as the pressure of her poorly executed attempt to lie her way out of trouble was abandoned. \n\n“No crap. We watched you. Who’s driving the Lincoln?” Biggs lay our cards on the table.\n\n“You saw me? You saw Terrell?” She was amazed by our investigative prowess. \n\n“Yes.” Biggs replied, letting her assume we already knew the dealer’s name.\n\n“Oh, wow. You got me then.” Sally shook her head in defeat as it dawned on her she’d be spending the night in jail. \n\n“Yeah, we do. What we don’t have is Terrell. You know more about him?” It’s the most pivotal point in trying to flip someone for a bigger fish – the offer. Biggs took the classic, “Let them think they’re in control” approach, and in this case, it worked. \n\n“Yeah, maybe. What’s in it for me?” Sally pondered Biggs with skepticism. \n\n“Well, if we arrest Terrell, I bet these rocks you ‘found’ could go away.” Biggs held the small morsels in front of her in an open palm.\n\nHer mental rock tumbler went back to work on this new, rough concept. Her finished product was much more polished this time around. “I can buy from him again tonight, if that’s what you mean.” She made the offer with her head dropped, looking up at Biggs with docile, “don’t yell at me” eyes. \n\n“Perfect. I’ll make some calls.” Biggs gave me a nod as he made his way back to the cruiser to start collecting the assets we would need for a control buy.\n\n“So, Sally. What’re doing for work these days?” My question seemed to startle her from a trance and she opened her mouth to answer but no words came out. \n\nFinally, after much contemplation, she came up with an answer. “I’m a, uhhh… teacher?”\n\n“Teacher?” Why pick that as your cover story of all things? “Really? What do you teach?”\n\n“Uhhh… kindergardening.” I tried to stifle my laugh but couldn’t hold back a snarky reply.\n\n“Is that when you grow five year olds from seeds?” I offered it as straight faced as I could. She just looked confused and clearly wanted to change the subject before inadvertently admitting she was a prostitute. \n\n“Narcs was already at the station. They’ll give us the buy funds, we’ll follow her in and try to figure out who Terrell is.” Biggs saved her from more tough questioning on my part.\n\n“Cool. What do we do with her?” I thumbed in the direction of Sally. \n\n“You’ll stay here, right Sally? Like a good girl?” Biggs regarded her as an obedient lap dog. \n\n“Oh, yes. I’ll be here. You bet. I’ll be here right until you get back.” Sally nodded enthusiastically. \n\nTrue to her word, Sally hadn’t moved and inch when we returned. We gave her the run down on how the operation was going to proceed. “Make the call, do what you have to do, but we’re going to follow you and figure out more about this Terrell guy.” \n\nShe agreed and called a memorized number from the nearby payphone. After some awkward stuttering, she set up another purchase. She explained Terrell had just returned from downtown after scoring a new supply when he rolled up on her in the street. It wasn’t unusual for her to call him at all hours, multiple times a day to request her poison of choice whenever she had the funds.\n\n“He said to come over to his place and pick it up.” She added before we started. \n\n“You know where he lives?” I was confused why we hadn’t heard this earlier. \n\n“Uhhh… yeah?” She was confused by my confusion. You have to speak black and white sometimes when dealing with a certain set of humanity. ",

        "text": "Drug busts are common on our campus.  Mostly it’s recreational grade marijuana and cocaine the university can self-adjudicate. Anything more than a couple of ounces of weed or a few grams of cocaine requires an arrest. These are few and far in between, except when we get them, they’re usually a big bust. Stories of bricks of marijuana or cocaine, guns, cash, and clear signs of big-time distribution are sacred amongst our crew and reinforces the “There is no such thing as routine” mindset a lot of us have adopted.\n\nIt started with a marijuana bust that led to the discovery of several vials of PCP. After squeezing some information out of the dealer, we were able to ascertain that several were sold. A few were recovered; however, there was enough going around that were unaccounted for that it caused some concern. Required departmental training included familiarization training with an agent from the DEA and our Captain, who at the time, was in charge of giving us updates to the law and some recent trends of weapons and drugs.\n\n\nI sat in the back with my buddy Jim. Jim was ex-Navy, and one of my closest friends at the department. We both had similar styles of policing and had risen through the ranks quickly after acquiring multiple arrests and cracking big cases. He was a bit of a jokester, and did not pull any punches. He told you how it was plainly and simply, which caused him to be the center of often controversial stories of racism and bigotry. He was a redneck, through and through, but he didn’t care who or what you were. He treated everyone equally and didn’t care about rank, race, creed, color, or your own personal insecurities.\n\nHe was currently working through half a can of Skoal when I sat down. It was early, almost too early. The previous night landed us outside the local pub giving statements to the city police for intervening on a domestic that happened right outside the bar. After being held up for several hours with a buzz that was turning in to a headache from lack of further consumption of alcohol, we called it a night and slept in the bunk room. I carefully sipped my scalding hot cup of coffee while Jim stuffed the other half of Skoal in to his cheek. He had visible purple rings forming under his eyes and looked like Death. \n\nSleep was almost non-existent for both of us, working through wife and child issues while working the evening shift. We hardly saw our families during the work week, and departmental training early in the mornings saw us at an impasse of making the decision of driving home and possibly getting one to two hours of sleep and coming back, or sleeping in the hot, stuffy, and crowded bunk rooms. Opting for the latter, we slept maybe two hours before waking up to go to our training. Best sleep ever.\n\n“I hate this shit…” Jim muttered. He chucked the empty can of Skoal across the room where it bounced off the trashcan and landed at the feet of the Captain. Reluctantly, he got up from his chair and sauntered up to the front of the room. Leaning forward, he half-whispered, half-choked out a “Go fuck yourself” to the Captain that the whole room heard. We all had a pretty close relationship, and the Captain was quick to retaliate in a similar fashion by sticking one huge paw in front of Jim’s face and giving him the finger. Jim laughed and came back to his seat smiling. \n\nThe rest of the day proved to be a boring affair with the speaker going through almost 300 slides of different drugs, their definitions, and showing pictures of the effects of these drugs. After seeing crime scene photographs of one or two grisly self-mutilations and short videos of bodies twitching from the effects of PCP long after their owners were declared brain-dead, we broke for lunch. Jim and I quickly ran to a local burger place and dropped an insane amount of money for a simple burger and fry lunch with cold root beer to wash it down. Upon entering the classroom, the Captain and DEA agent waved us over to look over the previous arrest report for the PCP vials.\n\n“You guys familiar with this?” said the Captain. He was a huge guy, easily dwarfing everyone in the room by at least a foot and nearly 50 pounds. He treated everyone fairly and was easy to work with. He did his time as the head supervisor of our Tactical Unit that was essentially a Power Shift that provided extra coverage on the weekends. Stories from him always started with “I’ve seen some shit, so listen up.” Everyone knew what he was about first and foremost: “I’m going home at the end of the day. No knucklehead is going to grease me before I’m old and gray.” \n\nI nodded between bites of burger and Jim slurped loudly at his drink in acknowledgement. “I want you guys to take the Tac Shift this weekend. I’ve already briefed the other guys, but I want you guys to be there since you have already dealt with this kind of thing before.”\n\nHe was referring to a call me and Jim had back a year prior where a PCP laced cigarette led a student to smash through reinforced glass on the exterior of one of our academic buildings. Breaking just about every bone in his arms and hands, he continued to smash and rampage until the entire University Police Department arrived to take him in to custody. It took nearly nine officers to wrestle him to the ground and handcuff him. It was a very scary moment, as we had little training with this type of behavior.\n\nWe both accepted our new assignment with much reluctance. No sleep for the weekend and very late nights. We went back to our seats and chatted idly about the upcoming weekend. We paid no attention to the speaker at all, contemplating a generous use of a departmental KMA Day for the weekend.\nThe weekend came swiftly. I had very little time to prepare for an overnight shift that I never had the pleasure (or displeasure) of working. It began halfway through the evening shift, and ended halfway through the midnight shift. I was normally in bed snoring by midnight, and these next two days would completely screw up my sleep schedule. I donned my tactical vest and baseball cap, clipped in all my gear, and kissed my wife on the way out the door. This would be the first time in two years we didn’t sleep next to each other.\n\n\nRoll Call was a much more intensive affair than our usual lazy afternoon roll calls. The three other guys there were all FTO’s on their off-months when they weren’t training new officers on their shifts. Squared away, professional, and completely decked out in Tactical gear that many of us found humorous since they weren’t a SWAT team and did essentially the same job as any other officer.  We sat in the back as the squad leader “Playdough” came in to the room.\n\nPlaydough (got his name from looking exactly like the kid on the front of the little canisters of Playdough) was the scummy supervisor everyone hated because he had friends higher up in the chain and he can’t do any wrong. He prided himself on being an aggressive police officer and called the rest of us “soft”. He talked down to everyone, was a know-it-all, and had no concept of interpersonal skills when dealing with members of his own department. Most importantly: he was a snitch. He was the one who would run to a supervisor if someone said or did something. Talk bad about the department? Playdough would run and snitch. Let someone off with a warning? You got snitched.\n\nI guess the old saying “It’s not who you know, it’s who you blow” holds true to Playdough, who was peering at us with a look of exaggerated disgust that non-FTO’s were working his precious Tac Shift. \n\n“So, Kik and Jim have joined us today because The Captain decided we can’t do our jobs right and needed more guys for the weekend. Guess tonight we’ll have to babysit the rookies.” He laughed to himself. None of the other guys mirrored his mirth. I made a mental note that there was some discord amongst the ranks of the Tactical Shift.\n\nHe proceeded to throw some BOLO’s our way and read off a couple of points of interest. We didn’t exactly have an assigned area, and basically floated around the campus. There were two unmarked cruisers they used for Special Operations that the Tac guys rode in, and neither were assigned to me or Jim. It seemed that we would be hoofing it tonight. He ended with a “Don’t get shot” directed to me and Jim and walked out, leaving us to speak with the other guys.\n\nWe chatted idly for a few before checking gear and hitting the street. It was a bit of a change for us as we started to see some of the evening guys pop up out of nowhere to engage us with pats on the back for our recent “promotions”.  Playdough was sneering at one end of the hallway as one of his minions checked out gear and they went out to the cruiser depot to hit the street. \n\nSuddenly, my buddy Josh rushed in to the squad room, jingling a set of keys around and presenting it to us in the manner akin to accepting Knighthood from Her Majesty the Queen.\n\nI couldn’t help but smile at his gesture. Several other guys that were standing around put on their best stone faces and stared at us. Josh looked as if he was proposing in his stance on the floor. “I present to you good Sirrah, a token of our friendship!  And, of course, a means of accommodating one hot and sweaty bike officer in the cool air conditioning of this sacred cruiser I have reserved for our evening-shift Tactical Trainees!” That generated a cluster of grunts and cries from our fellow officers; one bellowing his best War-cry and raising his ASP high in the air like a sword and pumping both fists.\n\nStrange people I work with.\n\nWe made tracks to the bucket Josh had managed to grab from depot and piled in. I cranked the air conditioning on full blast and gunned the cruiser out of the lot, the ancient machine creaking heavily as it moaned out of the lot and on to the street. It was one of our spare cruisers that went in service when one of the new ones was broken, and had been on the job at least a decade. Its odometer was busted, the seats were torn, the roof cloth was ripped and hanging, the cage in the back had been pulled out to be placed in to another cruiser in such haste that the repair guy didn’t even bother taking out the mounting brackets, and it still sported the original tires.  It was a beast of a machine, and I loved driving her.\n\nJim started immediately with a fresh can of Skoal while Josh gave us the rundown. It was a fairly busy day by his account for our department, with various thefts and a drug bust that started on day-work and continued in to the evening shift. We swung by the drug scene and were greeted by Sergeant Cookie from our department and Lieutenant Brisk, a city police department official. \n\nBoth Cookie and Brisk were our seniors by at least two generations, both of whom were friends since “before you punks were even in diapers” as they said countless times.  They were currently debating the logistics of leaving a bunch of snot nosed rookies in charge to process the scene and getting dinner when we pulled up. We discussed the current situation and Sgt. Cookie nodded to me “Let me know what happens.”  I started for a minute, and then bit my tongue as I realized I was just left in charge of an arrest scene. Promotion! He clapped me on the shoulder and jumped in Lt. Brisk’s cruiser. They sped off before any of us had a chance to acknowledge him. Shit definitely runs downhill here.\n\nI took a peek at the scene being processed and watched one of the other guys question the small kid in the hallway. He was cuffed, had snot and tears pouring off of his face, and was blubbering incoherent statements that Ray had to ask him to repeat several times. Ray was ex-Army, and was a hard-ass when he needed to be. Normally he was on midnights, but a recent promotion landed him on evenings and his tactical prowess of midnights was on full display as he launched in to “I deal with druggies and drunks all day now shut up and tell me what you know” mode. \n\nAllegedly, this particular kid ended up with a vial of “something to take the edge off” through a fraternity party and his buddy just snatched it and ran off as we were showing up. We tried to track him down, as we knew the possible contents to which our current prisoner said “I thought it was just water…” and offered us no real assistance in finding him. We tried to underline and highlight the fact that PCP is frickin’ dangerous, however, he immediately broke down in to tears and was completely unresponsive through his sobs after.\n\nSeveral hours later, the sun had gone down and the drunkies came out to play. Mostly pre-gamers who decided it was okay to knock over trashcans and throw rocks at buildings, but several fights broke out all over campus, which marked the beginning of a busy night. We ran call to call, trying to see if any of them matched the description of our Frat Bro and the loaded vial of PCP, to no avail. \n\n“Dispatch to Ops Five.” Me and Jim looked at each other. The voice of the Dispatcher indicated this was a big call with the high pitch and quick, barking words. \n\nJim keyed up. “Report of an individual naked in the Quad. Caller reports he was… growling… and running back and forth with no clothes on. -*Description*- Advise.” Jim broke a smile and I started to sweat. We had found our PCP Frat Bro.\n\nWe pulled up on the far side of the quad. It was in the middle of several academic buildings and had openings to the city streets on all sides, which meant lots of escape routes. We parked inconspicuously away from the area where there was the most foot traffic to get a better angle on the whole area.  Jim unclipped the retention strap on his pepper spray and I put one hand on my ASP. There would be no fight here if we went full-out and I wasn’t about to let my face get peeled off. \n\nI used my flashlight to light up the dark spots while we crept along in a side-by side formation. One of the midnights guys marked up that he was setting up on the opposite side of us and would come towards us in a broad sweep of the area. I kept looking around as things crept in to the corner of my peripheral vision, a minor effect of the nervousness that crept in to my gut. Something was off. There was no one around and it was pretty dark for an area that was normally lit with light posts.\n\nThen I noticed the glass. A row of low-hanging lights on poles around the walkways was broken out and glass covered the ground. It led to the rear of one of the academic buildings and everything was covered in shadows. Small amounts of blood were visible on the bricks lining the walkway and there was trash everywhere from several overturned trashcans. I picked up the pace, following the destruction until we came to a small alcove behind one of the buildings.\n\nI’m pretty sure I had a heart attack at that moment. Turning the corner with my light in front of me, I was greeted with a solid fist to the side of the head that dimmed the lights briefly. Everything blurred, and the pain felt like a small nuclear bomb had gone off in my right temple.  I struggled to maintain my balance, catching myself with my left hand as I went down to one knee and lunged forward with both hands, seeking my assailant. I came up empty and hit the wall with both hands, pushing back with all of my strength to get myself in to the open so I could fight. My vision cleared and I was able to find my assailant.\n\nJim had been right beside me as we reached the alcove and had did the smart thing and “cut the pie”, rather than edging the corner like I did. Huge mistake on my part, as the guy snaked a stiff jab from his hiding spot right in to the side of my head with enough force to rattle Jim’s teeth, and he didn’t even get hit. He quickly doused the guy with a quick shot of pepper spray and went hands on with a straight arm-bar takedown. He was wrestling with the bloody and very naked subject on the ground. He was snarling and fighting against the wrist-lock that Jim applied in a typical goose-neck fashion for handcuffing. It felt like a dream, with everything happening in slow-mo and the haze of the lights from other parts of the quad tugging at my blurred vision.\n\nI snapped back to reality and jumped on the attacker, placing one knee on his shoulder to pin his other arm and tried to wrestle his arm in to handcuffing. Jim was being tossed around like a rag-doll, the strength of the subject overpowering his skinny frame. I hit the panic button at that moment and screamed in to the microphone on my shoulder for backup. It seemed like an eternity of flailing arms, kicking feet, biting , snarling, spitting, and screaming before more units arrived on scene to pin the subject to the ground. After what was only 30 seconds but felt like five hours, we managed to handcuff him and called for a bus.\n\nSometime during the fray, the subject managed to miraculously calm himself to the point where he was able to formulate coherent speech. It was if he was a totally different person. Whatever he had taken, it caused him to temporarily lose his sanity for an instant before snapping back to a regular person.\n\n“So… Why are you naked?” Jim asked.\n\n“I took some acid and I just started tripping balls, so I just ran out. It never happened to me before… I thought you guys were coming to rob me so I ran back here and knocked the lights out with some rocks to distract you.” He said. The blood covering his legs was starting to dry, though none of the cuts were bleeding at that point. He stepped in the glass after he broke the lights and several small pieces of glass were still stuck to the bottoms of his feet.  He still had a wild look in his eyes and was sweating profusely, which usually doesn’t show up in LSD patients we’ve encountered before.  We chalked it up to him being on a PCP bender but he was very adamant that he didn’t take any of it when he “got it from his buddy”. \n\nOne of the other Tac guys managed to get an on-campus location for the subjects housing assignment and woke one of the RA’s to go in to the room. Sure enough, the unopened bottle of PCP was sitting on his desk along with several blots of LSD and cocaine. \n\nWe booked him for APO and Possession and hauled him off to CCB for medical evaluation and processing. I was sitting in the report writing room with an ice pack on my face where I was struck while Jim banged out the report. Several of the city police officers took shots at us while we were sitting there, congratulating us on a job well done and for getting our asses kicked.\n\n“Well, at least he didn’t rip your eyes out.” Jim said. He was typing away at the report while I lounged heavily in the plastic chair beside him.\n\n“Yeah… When we get the Tox from the doctors, we’ll see if he was lying. That guy was strong as hell…” I winced at the pain in my right eye. I was pretty sure I would probably get away with going home early that day, I would just have to prove to the supervisors that I couldn’t see with one eye which would affect my “targeting”. My cell rang and I answered. It was the Captain, having been woken up in the middle of the night to learn of our encounter.\n\n“Well, you guys did good. We got one of the bottles off the street at least. Shame you got hurt though. Can you still see?” I wanted to say that I couldn’t and wanted to ask if I could go home. Instead, I just grunted in to the receiver, and the Captain laughed on the other end of the line. “Go back to work. We got one more bottle to find.” \n\nWe finished up the paperwork and went back to the cruiser. It was nearly time for check-off and we were running on fumes at that point. I wanted to stop and get coffee, but I was too embarrassed to walk anywhere in public where people could see the angry purple bruise forming on the side of my head.  I sat in silence as we cruised back to campus listening to some old-school rock when something caught the side of my eye. Jim must’ve seen it too, because he suddenly locked the brakes on the car and squealed to a stop.\n\nOn the corner was an older male, about 6’ 5” tall, probably weighing anywhere from 300-350 pounds. What caught our eye was not just the size of the guy, but the fact that he was completely naked. Jim muttered “Fucking PCP…” and hit the lights on the cruiser. \n\nWe both stepped out and approached him. He was about the age of a young grandfather in his prime. His gut easily outweighed my own paunch by at least 100 pounds and thankfully dipped low enough over his waist that it covered his crotch. He took a drag off of the cigarette he had in his hand and nodded to us as we approached. I did not see a pack of cigarettes or a lighter on his person, so naturally I believed a well-meaning citizen offered him the smoke and light, free of charge.\n\n“Morning, Officers.” He said in a deep baritone that reminded me of Morgan Freeman. It was pleasant and calm, almost comforting. Jim looked at me and I glanced back, shrugging.\n\n“Hey, how you doin’, Sir?” I said as I approached his side. I didn’t want to get too close, but if he was being calm, I wanted to keep him that way as his size could easily have meant a tremendous struggle. He shrugged his shoulders and took another drag off his cig. \n\n“Good night for a smoke, eh?” He said. He was very nonchalant about the situation. I swallowed hard and pressed further “Um… Yeah. You know you’re naked, right?” I said motioning towards him. He regarded me cooly for a moment before looking down at his exposed belly and legs. “It appears I am.” He said. He took another puff off of the cigarette and stared down at us.\n\nA few minutes later, an ambulance had arrived to take him to the hospital along with the city police. Later, the city police told us the story. Allegedly, he bought what he thought was some Hash oil from “some kid on the corner” and wanted to get high while he was staying at a nearby hotel at a conference. Instead, he took a hit of PCP, and went wandering the city for a few hours before winding up on that corner where we spotted him. They ended up recovering the vial of PCP from his hotel room, which ended up being the missing vial from our previous bust. Small world, eh? He later ended up taking a plea for Possession and sent us a letter thanking us for helping him. \n\nJim and I look back on this every so often and think about that night. While it was crazy and we were pumped to be getting in to the dynamics of drugs we never dealt with, we always start out the story with a “Fucking PCP…”  and let the audience know that not everyone cracked out on PCP is going to rip your face off. Some of them just want a smoke.\n",

        "text": "Being a digital forensics guy, most of my LE life is behind a computer screen/tool of some sort. I love my toys and job, but it's not the most exciting all the time. The joy comes from helping - today that came from an unexpected place.\n\nWhile driving home, a call came over the radio about a missing 4yr old. I have a son who will be 4 this month - it instantly hit home. Over the next 3-4 minutes, I get all the info from the dispatcher:\n\n1. 4yr old girl reported missing, now for just under 2 hours\n2. Last seen by 16yr old sibling who was babysitting\n3. 4yr old \"wanted to play at the park\", but was told to wait by sibling\n4. About 15mins later, sibling unable to locate 4yr old. After looking for 30mins, calls parents and fesses up.\n5. Parents search for another 30mins, then call 911.\n\nDuring this time, my mind is racing. In my job, I see a lot of pictures I would rather not see, including of 4yr old girls. My mind goes to the worst (kidnapped?) during those few minutes of learning details. Then the location comes across: 2 blocks from where I am driving.\n\nI let dispatch know I'm in the area on the way home and will look around. I pull up the satellite view (go go gadget Google Maps!) and look for parks. None around within a number of blocks... but then I realize there is a school close by. My kids have gone there. They love the playground, and my 4yr old has called it a \"park\" before. My heart starts racing as I whip a U-turn and head for the parking lot.\n\nI hear a call for a heli come over the radio since daylight is dwindling. I park the cruiser and jump out. I don't hear or see anything, and all I know is it's a 4yr old girl wearing pink. I start jogging around the playground, looking in the toys and calling out if anyone can hear me. Nothing. =(\n\nStart heading back to the car with a feeling of defeat. Shit. The bike locker. My son LOVES it - they play \"cave\" in there all the time. I turn around and stare at it. The door is open. I walk briskly over and step in with a gentle \"Anyone in here?\"\n\n\"Stop!\" a small child whisper yells with a smile on her face. She's wearing pink. Smile forms on my face too. \"My animals are sleepy, you need to be quiet!\" She points at the bikes and helmets, all neatly arranged (as best a 4yr old can do).\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry!\" I whisper shout. \"Say darling, where is your mom or brother? Are they caring for some animals here too?\" She shakes her head no and says \"My mommy is working. &lt;Brother's name&gt; didn't want to play farm with me.\" I ask for her name and tell her I'll be right back. She nods with a smile and goes back to sorting helmets.\n\nI radio in the name for confirmation and give my location. I stay and play with her for the few minutes it takes until a uniformed officer arrives. We exchange a bit of info and I head back to my car. I radio dispatch the basics of what happened and head home with one of the better feelings I've had in a long time. I usually don't get to see kids happy after I help them, as it's mostly behind the scenes. feelsgoodman.jpg And I gave my 4yr old an extra-special hug when I got home.\n\n**::EDIT::** Hope you all had a fantastic day too. Mine was awesome. =) Thanks for your kind words, and the gold. I'm humbled.",

        "text": "I’m fortunate enough to know quite a few police officers, which means I get to hear all their crazy/funny/disgusting stories. This is one of my favourites, from John. He’s on the shorter side, but he’s got tons of muscle mass to make up for it. He’s quick on his feet, and has a cocky attitude to boot. Not someone I would wanna fuck with. And yet, some people still try their luck.\n\nIt was roughly 5am, and John was nearing the end of an arduous night shift. The sun was rising and the roads were filling with cars as people made their way to work. Right as John was preparing to return to the station, he was dispatched to a domestic partner dispute. He was the only available officer in the area, so he was forced to attend.\n\nHe pulled up to the house just as the boyfriend was coming out the front door. The guy was huge; roughly 6ft4 and build like a football player. Sort of like The Mountain from Game of Thrones. Massive, and scary. The BF paused in the middle of his lawn, panting heavily. John got out of the car, keeping his distance.\n\n“Fuck off!” the boyfriend called out. “We don’t need any fucking help from you guys.”\n\n“Look, I’m just here to talk.” John approached with his hands empty, slightly raised to show his submission. \n\n“I don’t wanna talk. I’ll fuckin’ fight you right now!”\n\nJohn stopped, watching as the beast of a man raised his fists, keeping them guarded in front of his reddening face. \n\n“Let’s go, man!” the boyfriend yelled, a vein bulging in his forehead as he began to pump himself up. “Fuckin’ fight me!”\n\nJohn realized at this moment that the situation was taking a dangerous turn. He took a few moments to collect his thoughts before trying out his tactic to deescalate the situation.\n\n“Listen, buddy. I’ll fight you if you want.”\n\nThe boyfriend wasn’t expecting that answer. He stalled a bit, but kept his fists clenched as John continued.\n\n“We can duke it out on your front lawn, in front of all your neighbours as they start leaving for work. I’ll probably even let you get a couple good shots to my face. But here’s the thing,” John said, bringing a hand to his holster. “I have a gun, and you don’t. If you attack me, only one of us is gonna make it out of this alive. And I can guarantee that it won’t be you.”\n\nThe BF wasn’t sure what to do at this point. His fists kept falling slightly, then jerking back up to fighting stance as the gears in his head clunked and turned, debating on whether a couple of punches to the cop’s face was worth getting shot.\n\n“Hey,” John finally said, interrupting the BF’s train of thought. “It’s pretty early. Have you had breakfast yet?”\n\nA look of utter confusion spread across the guy’s face. “N-No…”\n\n“Are you hungry? Did you wanna go grab some Tim’s?”\n\nThe BF lowered his hands at this point, and stood dumbstruck on his front lawn. “You’re shitting me.”\n\n“Nope,” John flashed a grin that was brighter than the lightening sky. “I'll take you out for breakfast, and I’ll even pay for you. All you gotta do is put some cuffs on and sit in my car for a bit.”\n\nThe BF was still doubtful. “Are you sure?” he said. “Like, you’re really gonna buy me breakfast?”\n\n“Yes, and if I have to explain this one more fucking time, I might change my mind.”\n\n“Okay, okay!” The BF turned around and stood with his hands clasped gently behind his back, checking over his shoulder every few seconds as John pulled his cuffs from his belt and slapped them on the BF’s beefy wrists. Then he went and sat in the back of the car, his face pressed up against the glass, watching the rest of the morning unfold.\n\nA few more officers arrived on scene. They spoke to the girlfriend and yup, she was banged up pretty badly, so her boyfriend would be going to jail. John returned to the cruiser and shared the news with his buddy in the backseat. He seemed unfazed. All he cared about was breakfast.\n\nAnd so, John took him to the Tim Horton’s drive-thru on their way to the station. He fed the BF timbits through the plexiglass partition, and then he went to jail happier than a pig in shit, his face dusted with icing sugar.",

        "text": "I grew up in Mayberry.   I knew many of the officers in town as my friend's dads, the chief was my football coach, and my dad was an alderman.  The main theme was \"don't fuck up, and don't be a bad person\".  Pretty simple, and honestly I was the most nieve kid you could possibly imagine. \n\nThis simplified existence came crashing down as it usually does when a 16 year old kid gets his first traffic ticket.   My downfall was dramatic, to say the least. \n\nWhat I was ticketed for was 42 in a 25 and operating left of center.   What I was doing was jumping railroad tracks with my dad's truck and impressing a buddy. This cop read me a riot act about being stupid and endangering our lives (typical scare the shit out of the kid type stuff).\n\nThat wasn't what I was worried about.   I was worried about home.   You see,  my state required minors to attend traffic court with their parent. To top it off,  my aunt and uncle lived with us at the time while their house was being built, and my uncle was a retired cop from Milwaukee that loved to rib the shit out of me. Fuck me, why now, why like this? \n\nI went home and went right up to my room and broke down because \"I'm now one of 'those' people\".  My old man came up and asked what was up, and I could only point at my tickets.   He pat me on the back and told me I fucked up, but we would get through this. \n\nWhat was revealed to me 10 years later is what happened next.   \n\nDad went to the town meeting and he bumped into the Chief.   Chief asked my old man what we should do about these tickets, as we could just make them go away. Dad told him to \"let it ride, the kid is scared shitless,  and that's not all bad\".  \n\nTwo weeks later, my old man bumped into the judge who happened to see a certain Abzug pop up on his court cases.  Again, what would you like us to do? \n\nThat's when my dad struck upon the the best decision he's ever made, and told the judge \"Do what you think is right, but scare the hell out of the kid so he doesn't end up wrapped around a tree\".  The trap was set and I was walking into it blindly. \n\nI still don't remember what that judge said to me as I barely croaked out \"no contest\" in a shaking voice, but I do remember him standing up and leaning over his desk yelling as big as God himself \"IF I EVER SEE YOU IN MY COURT AGAIN, I'M THROWING THE BOOK AT YOU!\".  *Bang* Reduced speeding ticket, dropped left of center ticket.  I nearly pissed myself with fear. \n\nThe funny thing is that was twenty-two years ago this month, and I still have yet to have another ticket. Turns out the old man did well in not raising \"that kind of guy\".\n\nThanks for listening, and to all of you LEOs out there, a little fear goes a long way. ",

And so the story begins!\n\nOn a moderately cold November night, I was driving my squad car eastbound on a certain road, when I got a call for service over the radio. I was to respond to an emergency situation, where a woman was caught stealing a can of baby formula, and when confronted she got belligerent. So I went from a silent run, to lights and sirens. I pulled up in the fire lane of the store, and all seemed normal. *Seemed* normal... I knocked on the security door to find the woman had punched the security officer of the store in the face, bloodied his nose, and gave him a black eye. She was in handcuffs at that time I knocked on the door, and she tried saying she did nothing wrong. After reviewing security footage, talking to a manager, and patting her down to find two other cans of baby formula in her jacket, I decided to hand her a ticket for retail theft. But not before arresting her for battery. ",

        "text": "JR and I met in high school and had been fast friends for several years. In addition to our love of drinking, smoking weed and Southern rock music we enjoyed getting outdoors, fishing, hunting and generally raising hell. We were your typical wild Texas quasi-redneck city boys. At the time of this incident we were in our early 20s.\n\nMy friend JR, his father and I had, for a few weeks, been planning a fishing trip to Fayette County Reservoir in Central Texas. Fayette County Reservoir is known for producing top notch largemouth bass and we were hoping to catch a few. To get to the lake from our side of town we would have about a 2 hour drive. Our plan was to get up about 2:30 AM, pick up JR’s father’s about 3:00 AM, hook up the boat then head for the lake hoping to be on the water before sunrise. The evening before we were due to leave JR and I headed out to the local Kroger to purchase provisions and load the truck. Once we had acquired all of the groceries we loaded the truck with fishing tackle, coolers, beer, the groceries we had purchased and various other provisions. All loaded up and ready we retired to JR’s apartment for the night.\n\nThe alarm clock sounded way too early for a couple of guys not used to getting up before the sun. We got up, threw on our fishing outfits (ratty shorts and t-shirts) splashed some water on our faces, smoked a wake up joint and headed out to the truck. I fired up the truck, pulled out onto the deserted two lane road and we headed off to pick up JR’s dad. As I rolled up to a stop sign I checked my rearview mirrors and noticed a set of headlights about three quarters of a mile back down the road. I did not really think anything of it, stopped at the intersection and proceeded on down the road. All of the sudden I noticed those headlights were now directly behind us and then I noticed the red and blue flashing lights. Crap! Being the good driver that I am I pulled off to the shoulder, turned off the truck and awaited instruction. One of the officers got me out of the truck, patted me down and started questioning me. Where were we coming from? Where were we going? What did we have in the truck? While officer one was quizzing me his partner was shining his light into the back of the truck looking at all of the bags of grocery items we had loaded. Did we have a receipt for the groceries? Uh, no, no receipt. I was more than a little confused as to what was happening until he mentioned that there had been a break in at the corner convenience store right by JR’s apartment. As the squad was rolling up to the scene they saw our taillights “leaving the scene of the crime” and gave chase. Once they explained why they had stopped us I was able to show them the sacks of groceries came from Kroger (think goodness for store branded products) and not the little c-store on the corner. We were quite relieved when they agreed that we were not the guys that had burglarized the corner store and allowed us to continue on to our fishing expedition.\n\nWe arrived to pick up JR’s dad about 20 minutes late and he started to give us a hard time for being late until we explained what happened, then he started laughing at the vision of two scruffy looking guys getting stopped and questioned by the police. We did make it to the lake before sunrise and had a good day fishing. Good times!\n\n\nEdit: I need to learn how to spell expedition.",

        "text": "Have a good flight /u/floatingfeathers!\n_________________________________\n\n\n\nJim cursed his computer and threw his head back in exasperation. He turned down the football game we had been listening to and gritted his teeth as he told me what had ruined his afternoon. \n\n“Getting sent to a nut! Damn it! There’s only, like, three minutes left in the game too.”\n\nI grimaced, more for Jim’s benefit than my own. I had every intention to hear how the game ended. “Damn dude, sorry. That sucks.” \n\n“You want to come?” He smiled, half-pleading. \n\nHe was pulling the “buddy card,” a dirty trick but one I had to honor. I silently cursed in the direction of my steering wheel. “Whatever. But you’re gonna owe me if I miss the game.”\n\nJim was satisfied with the arrangement and dropped his car into drive. I followed him as we weaved through traffic towards the high-rise apartment building where the complainant was requesting our assistance with her brother. Apparently he had been skipping his meds and was hallucinating. I already knew the tactic we would employ – “Is he a threat to himself or others? No? Well here’s the number for the out-patient mental hospital up the road. Feel free to take him yourself if you want.” Mentals were annoying and at times unpredictable, but usually they were an open and shut case. \n\nAs we pulled up to the front of the building, our team tied up the game. I could see Jim’s fist pumping from my spot behind him and took note of his hesitation to exit his vehicle. Then I noticed two other cruisers pull up behind us. Devon and Brandon had just cleared a call on the other side of the road and had come over to see what we were up to.\n\nI saw Brandon shaking his head dejectedly. It was his team mine and Jim’s was now tied with. “Whatever!” He said, preempting my opportunity to throw an insult in his direction. “We’ll come back. You guys don’t have it in you to close out anything.”\n\n“Five bucks says we win.” Devon was a fan of our local team too, and his wager was met with Brandon’s serious contemplation over whether he was willing to lose some cash.\n\n“No cash, loser takes the next report.” Brandon upped the ante. \n\n“No: winner *picks* the next report the loser writes.” Devon countered with an uppercut. All of us knew that could be a death sentence. \n\nBrandon squinted his eyes with steely resolve. “It’s on.” \n\nJim exited his car and walked to our group. “Let’s knock this BS out. We can get back in time for the two minute warning.” He started towards the lobby and I joined him, leaving Brandon and Devon bickering behind us \n\n“But no decomps, right?” Brandon asked.\n\n“Screw that, winner gets to pick.” Devon was having none of it.\n\nIn the lobby we met with the complainant. It was just as she had told the call taker: Her brother, who lived with her, was a full blown schizophrenic. He had been off his meds for a long time because “he was cured” and was in a particularly manic mood that afternoon. He was concerned about people spying on him through the walls and his neighbors being government agents – typical paranoia. The last bit was the kicker. “He can get violent with police. He doesn’t know you’re coming.”\n\nThat threw a monkey wrench into our plans. \n\nKnowing we had to make contact and not above asking advice from the person who would best know what we were walking into, Jim asked the woman what we could do to make everything go smooth.\n\n“We’re on the ground level, around back. Maybe if you walk up while he’s smoking a cigarette we can ease into a conversation and you can take it from there? I’m really worried about him.”\n\nWe agreed with her plan and made our way back to our cruisers to pull them around back. Devon and Brandon were still verbally sparring over the football broadcast. \n\n“Yeah, loser *could* double down on tomorrow’s game, or they could just take the CD.” Devon told Brandon.\n\n“What CD?” Brandon was confused. \n\n“See Deez nuts in your throat.” Devon cracked a rare smile thanks to his perfectly executed, if not juvenile, verbal trap. \n\n“We’re going around back, you donkeys.” I told them as I loaded up. “Dude’s going to take a smoke break and we’re going to talk to him on his patio.”\n\nBrandon’s team was driving down the field as I pulled my cruiser into a visitor spot near the complainant’s patio. They hadn’t exited the sliding door yet so I decided on practicality and waited in my idling car, my window rolled down so I could talk to Jim who was parked next to me. \n\nThe sliding door opened and the caller stepped out. She noticed us in the parking lot and threw her hands up, apologetically shrugging at the same time. Apparently she was having difficulties motivating her suspicious brother into his smoke break. Tim waved back, non-verbally indicating she could take her time. Our defense was giving up large chunks of AstroTurf on every play and he was fine with waiting to hear the resolution of the game.\n\n“I got the Taser if he fights.” I told Jim.\n\n“Cool. No spray, deal? I don’t feel like spicy food today.” Jim was as susceptible as I was to the noxious, non-lethal weapon. I agreed with him whole-heartedly. \n\nDevon and Brandon pulled up behind us and I could hear the radio blaring our team’s inevitable demise from Devon’s car as the two exited and began their verbal sparring match again. Jim and I exited too, but stayed near our cars in case the guy decided on taking his Marlboro break. The sliding door was still cracked open and the curtain inside fluttered in the breeze. We could hear the caller’s voice from inside, angrily lecturing her brother. We also heard the sound of moving furniture, or something being dragged across the floor. Still no visual sign of them however. \n\nSuddenly, “Interception!” Devon was jumping up and down, uncharacteristically enthusiastic and juxtaposing Brandon’s disbelief. \n\n“Yes!” Jim said, walking towards the pair to get a better listen of the game. I was turned towards them too, happy in Brandon’s depression. The explosion from behind me didn’t catch my attention as much as the oven tumbling through the parking lot and smashing into a parked taxi cab.\n\n“Holy crap!” Jim and I stared at an oven shaped hole in the brick wall of the apartment building. Flames were stabbing into the air from the new “window” and an orange glow was lighting the curtain which was now billowing out the cracked sliding door. We sprinted, all four of us, to the apartment. \n\nJim was there first and entered without hesitation as Devon went on the radio to start the fire department. A second later Jim exited, pulling the now unconscious caller out with him. Her hair and blouse were singed but she was otherwise unharmed. Devon inched towards the inferno, shielding his face with his forearm while Brandon and I tended to the downed woman. \n\nJim made his way back to the fire as well, joining Devon in his Nosferatu impersonation as they peered into the hellish interior. Devon had pulled the door open wide and the added oxygen seemed to have intensified the voracity of the flames. \n\nBrandon and I both looked up at the same time, peering past Jim and Devon and into the flames. A glowing figure paced back and forth, about ten yards inside the apartment-come-oven. Jim cupped his hands and yelled at the man, now fully engulfed in flames, to come towards them. \n\n“No! Not until I get my shoes on.” A voice called back.\n\n“Holy shit.” Brandon muttered. \n\nDevon and Jim looked at each other, forming a plan. Jim’s head bobbed, one, two, three, and the two charged in and grabbed the man by the wrist, pulling him so hard he was wrenched off his feet and jerked out the door before he could protest. \n\nDevon worked on beating out the flames and Jim held the man down to prevent him from running back in to his home. The man was struggling with him and I stood to assist. Before I could join him, Jim’s grip slipped and the man jumped to his feet and sprinted back into the flames. Jim was left holding the skin from the man’s degloved hand. \n\n“HOLY SHIT!” Brandon yelled from my former vantage back with the still unconscious woman. \n\nThe fire intensified still. All we could was watch as the man found his shoes and calmly exited again. Flames ate away at his shirt as he walked to meet us, smiling oddly and greeting us. “I needed my shoes. Can’t have them getting into the soles of my feet!” He was almost chipper and he didn’t seem to realize the skin on his arm was melting slowly to the ground. \n\nThe fire sirens were close and we guided the man, trying our best not to touch his sloughing injuries, into the parking lot to wait for medical personnel. Devon and Brandon took on the task of evacuating nearby apartments and Jim and I stood, dumbfounded, as EMTs rushed to assist our patient. He thanked us over his shoulder as he was ushered off to an ambulance en route to a medevac. He died an hour later in the burn center. \n\nThe caller came to before we left. She said she was trying to convince her brother to go out for a smoke but he was adamant there was a spy in the wall behind the gas oven. He jerked it from the wall, severing the gas line, and went to light a celebratory cigarette after completing his task, causing the explosion that sent the oven through the brick wall. She was knocked unconscious immediately and was spared the haunting vision of her brother walking around like the human torch, oblivious to his dire situation. \n\nAfter everything calmed down, we gathered for a debrief of the event. We were huddled together with several other squad-mates, discussing the craziness we had just witnessed when Devon joined us. \n\n“Well, we won Brandon. Guess what report you’re writing.” He was pointing to the still-smoldering cave that used to be an apartment to emphasize his decision. \n\nBrandon took in the sight with reverence. “Well, at least I don’t have to write the Bofa.” He told us all. \n\n“Bofa?” Devon tripped and fell into Brandon’s trap. \n\n“Bofa deez nuts in your mouth! OOOH!!” His laughter was out of place in the lingering odor of burnt flesh.\n\n“Oh! Burn!” Jim said, regretting his choice of words almost immediately.\n",

Cookouts, beer, fireworks, shooting guns, the whole nine yards. As it happens, our state had a bit of a tough stance on fireworks, and like most others, drinking and driving. I had heard tell of all sorts of checkpoints around the area, which is normal. I didn't expect to have any problems going through any of them. \nI was headed down a 2 Lane about a mile and a half from my house when I saw a pickup truck going 20 in a 45. In addition, this pickup had a car following about 3 feet behind it. Weird. After a few curves, I figured that the truck was probably towing the car which isn't exactly smiled upon. An oncoming car flashed their brights at us, my being about 30 feet behind the truck car combo in front of me. Oh shit. A checkpoint. I see the lights about 100 yards out, coming onto the straightaway. As we get closer, I wonder what the troopers will say to the folks in front of me. After a short conversation, the trooper motioned for the truck to pull to the side of the road. My turn. \nGoing back a bit here. I carry a concealed handgun, like most all of tftsc probably does. I carry in a iwb holster, about 430. This also happens to be where my wallet is, with chp and license. Knowing I didn't want to show up to the checkpoint empty handed, and tell a trooper that my wallet was next to my gun, I had it out and ready to go as soon as I saw the lights in the distance. Back to the present. \nI come to a stop beside the trooper. \nMe:\"Evening trooper.\"\nHim:\"Evening!\"\nI hand the trooper my license and chp. \nHim:\"You carrying tonight?\"\nMe:\"yessir\"\nHands me my cards. \nHim:\"Have a good evening.\"\n\nI went on home. \nBoring story, but police work isn't all laughs and adventures. I might share a few ride along stories this week. Hope you enjoyed this look into the other side of cops just \"doing their jobs\". Happy America day folks! ",

        "text": "Now, this title has your interest right? As I intended.\n\nDisclaimer: I type on a mobile,  so formatting might be off. Also, a  dutch mobile has dutch spell check so some words I miss might be a bit off ;)\n\nAnyway, to the story! A few years ago I was serving in the royal dutch army and I had just returned from a tour i  Afghanistan. \nAs we had some experience under our belts our unit was chosen to help with training other units in role play scenarios. \nA group of us were playing a scenario near an abandoned farm near one of the biggest bases in europe, we were pretending to be a group of either taliban or afghan police (switched per scenario, we had different ones). \n\nWe were encouraged to look the part as much as we could so we didnt have to shave for a full 2 weeks and our outfit was not regular. I was dressed in combat boots, desert camo cargo pants, a half long black coat with some charring (tried to burn it once, didnt burn and forgot to throw it away, but decided to use it again) and one of those arabian scarfs with a red and white pattern on it. Also I looked like an afghan with my tan and beard. So i looked the part.  \n\nOh ye, I was carrying an Ak47 to complete it all.\n\nSo one day between exercises I was standing near the road to keep watch and smoking cigarettes while everyone else was inside drinking coffee or whatnot. I had my AK on my shoulder and I just stood there. \n\nAll of the sudden a few cars (about 3 or 4 iirc) approached me, quite rapidly and came to a sudden stop about 20 meters from where I was standing. Doors opened and people came out of the vehicles pointing small arms at me! Great joy! \n\nNow these cars were civilian cars, not marked police cars. As the army used placeholder vehicles to simulate other vehicles (most operational vehicles were deployed..blame it on budget cuts) I thought this was another excercise! \nSo I raised my AK and we were in a stand off! A few police officers vs me shouting at each other. I had a strict protocol and could only stop pointing my weapon if they did everything right. Which ment they had to have a \"translator\" talk to me. So i was enjoying myself until my colleagues came outside to see what was happening. Among these colleagues was 1 sergeant in charge of the operation who was in uniform. As soon as he came out the situation defused and he sent us inside as he went to talk with the police. \n\n\nApparently, some civilians had called 911 because some scruffy looking dudes with guns were walking around. The police reacted in sending cavalry thinking us to be criminals or worse, terrorists. \nHad the sergeant not come out I would have kept to my role and stood there as a typical afghan with a gun: hysterical and waving it around. Orders were to escalate if they didnt do as they were supposed to.\n\nI would have been shot at some point. \n\nafterwards we laughed our asses of. Great fun!\n\nSidenote: military police and special forces were also included in the exercise, so there was nothing off about their vehicles or gear. \n\nAnd yes, higher ups did inform all the needed parties, including police.\n\nSo that is how I almost got shot. Best joint exercise ever!",

        "text": "Another fun story from my collegiate days in the criminal justice department.\n\nSoon after the horrific tragedy of the Virginia Tech shooting, my local county sheriff decided that they really needed to revamp their active shooter procedures.  I'm sure this meant hours upon hours of meetings between experts and high-level brass, but for everyone who could potentially end up on the wrong end of a shooter's gun barrel, it meant training scenarios.  Hooray, a week of running around a school shooting sims!\n\nOf course, these kind of training need to be as realistic as possible.  Enter myself and the CJ frat, as we were asked to come down and act as survivors, victims, and bad guys.  Ooooo, this is going to be fun, it's Big Boy Paintball.  My little sister decided to tag along as well, seeing as how she likes stuff like this and had a free week.  In all, there were about 20 of us role players, to help train about 200 deputies and officers from the surrounding smaller municipal agencies.\n\nIt went very smoothly, except for one hiccup that no one at the sheriff's department thought about:  The training was held in the high school that my sister and I had attended.  We knew every locker, every hallway, every room.  We knew our way around the labryinthine bowels of the theater.  This was home turf, and damn if we weren't going to give everyone a run for their money.\n\nIf my sis or I were the bad guys, scenarios tended to run long.  They couldn't catch us.  They'd go into a room that they'd seen us enter, only to find we'd disappeared.  Then suddenly, we're behind the contact team, opening fire on them from the hallway.  Oh yeah, guys, that door that looks like a closet is actually a connecting hallway to a teacher's work area, which also opens on the classroom next door, which is how I circled around you and emptied an entire magazine at you without taking a single shot.\n\nThree days in to this, the higher-ups found out that their trained and much-vaunted deputies, some of whom were 20 year vets, were getting scragged by a couple of 20-somethings who were giggling like little kids.  So after some yelling behind closed doors and possibly threats to facility administrators, the floor plans for all schools, public buildings, and shopping malls were loaded into a big file and put on the shared drive that all area officers could access.  It wouldn't do a ton of good for the guy on point for a contact team who's already in the building, but at least everyone could spend a few seconds and familiarize themselves with the layout of a place before entering.\n\nThis would become a real-life necessity about 2 years later, when a distraught 22-year-old walked into out big mall with an AR-15 and opened fire, killing two and wounding a third before killing himself.  It was the guys and gals who I'd help train who responded, some arriving less than 60 seconds after dispatch announced the aituation.  I'd like to think that maybe just a tiny bit of the reason that they were able to contain the situation so fast and keep the body count low was the run-around that my sister and I gave them over spring break.\n\n----\n\nNow, for some funny.  My sister isn't a big person, less than 5'3\" and maybe a buck-o-five soaking wet.  But she's tenacious and witty.  On the last day of the scenarios, she was the only other role player to show up.  So she was given the big AR sim gun and ran every scenario as the bad guy, which was a new and exciting experience for her.\n\nHowever, it wasn't 100% enjoyable.  She took a lot of fire in those events, and one round somehow round it's way directly into her gluteus maximus, whcih really hurt.  She limped back to the staging area, where about a dozen officers were hanging around waiting for their turn.  Her limp attracted some attention:\n\n&gt; Officer 1:  \"Hey, you okay?\"\n\n&gt; Sis:  \"Yeah, just got tagged in the ass.  Who does that, shoot someone in the ass?\"\n\n&gt; Officer 1:  \"Well, we ARE trained to shoot for the biggest target.\"\n\nCue some chortles and smiles from the surrounding officers, all laughing at the fact that he'd 'got her.'  But like I said, she's tenacious and witty.  Without losing a beat:\n\n&gt; Sis:  \"SO I guess that means no one's going to be aiming for between your legs, now are they?\"\n\nHave you ever seen a dozen fully-geared officer fall down laughing?  It's a rather impressive sight.  Officer 1 could only offer a lame \"Hey!\" as a rejoinder, as my sis turned and walked away, verbally triumphant and held to a new level of respect by the other officers and deputies.",

We'll let the community hit the orange ups and blue downs for a while, and in the end I'll pick whatever I think is best anyway. :) \n\nIf I completely had my way, the Snoo would be two Snoo's, dressed as cops on either side of a water cooler. (do people still use the water cooler reference?)  Maye one is a blue uniform and one in green or black?  Like two cops swapping stories.  And the banner would be a collage of different sized closeups of cop stuff. Boots, radio mic, traffic vest, gun, cuffs, skid marks, light bar, etc. But closeups so its not a pair of boots, its like the side of a pair of Danners that fills the frame.

        "text": "There are strange dichotomies in every job, I’m sure. Maybe those in law enforcement are similar to those in, say, retail. But I doubt it. \n\nI huffed down the hallway, making my way back to my cruiser parked in the secure lot of the station. The news I wouldn’t be getting a max raise for the year was really putting a damper on what was otherwise a beautiful day. \n\nI kept running over what my lieutenant had said: “You’re the best criminal cop on the squad, EMR, but you need to write more tickets. Keep up the felony stats but I’ll need more citation stats if I’m going to justify giving you the full raise. You should be proud of how you’re doing though.” \n\nI passed by Ned who was walking into the station and kept the pleasantries brief. He was the kind of guy who, even though he’d been on the job for twenty years, would still “get lost” on the way to back you up on a call in his area. He did write a couple more tickets than I did though. Oh, and he always got max raises. It was hard not to be resentful and I was glad to close the door to my car and have a moment to breathe it out before returning to the street. I called my wife to vent as I pulled out of the parking lot, but that didn’t help. \n\n“Well, I guess you need to write more tickets then.” She was shockingly on the side of my supervisors. \n\n“Wha-?! But I pull in the best criminal stats in the station! Don’t you think they should be happy with the fact I’m locking up drug dealers and rapists and not getting complained on by soccer-moms who didn’t fully stop at a stop sign?!?” I was incredulous at her lack of shock at our lack of raise.\n\n“I’m just saying they’re the ones who tell you how to do your job. Maybe you should do it the way the say?” Where was her anger? Her ‘stand by your man’ instinct?!?\n\nThe urge to vent was suddenly replaced by need to go prove my boss wrong and write some stupid tickets. “Yeah, maybe you’re right. I’ll go write some now.” I told her I loved her and hung up before reluctantly making my way to the only traffic trap I could tolerate enforcing. \n\nMy trap was the intersection of a large road with that of a much less traveled one. The small road dead ended on the big road and was controlled by a stop sign. Because traffic plagued that section of town, there were three signs indicating it was unlawful to make a left turn. Usually the people I pull over would begrudgingly accept guilt when I showed them these three DOT approved traffic markings, especially when I give the out that maybe they just missed them accidently. \n\nI get set up and right out of the gate I get a candidate. It was almost painful to watch as my soon-to-be victim of a citation slowly parted traffic to make the illegal maneuver but I had a job to do and a raise to earn during my next evaluation cycle. I pulled the car over and it was clear as soon as I approached that I was in for a treat. \n\nThe woman behind the wheel already had an expression indicating her extreme dissatisfaction with my intrusion into her daily routine. She regarded me with contempt as I leaned down to give my agency mandated introduction speech. \n\n“Good afternoon. My name is officer EMR and the reason I pulled you over is because you made a left turn onto Oak Street from Elm even though there are three signs saying that only right turns are permissible.” Her head recoiled back slowly, serpent like, as my soliloquy progressed before she struck out.\n\n“Awwwww hell no! You just pulled me over because I’m black!” She put a fake-nailed finger in my face and shook it back and forth to accentuate her accusation. “I’m going to need to see you supervisor, now!”\n\nIt was exactly why I didn’t write tickets. I called my boss and explained the complaint, asking if he could hurry so I could get on with my busy day of ticket writing. He agreed, but added a cliff hanger. \n\n“I’m en route but it’s a good thing you called. Lt. Thompson just called about you. I need to talk to you about something.” Supervisors – don’t do this to your troops please. The entire time I waited for him to show up I was mentally reviewing anything I might have done recently to garner the attention, presumably negative, of the second in command of our intelligence unit. \n\nLt showed up and quickly resolved the complaint (he was black also; it kind of deflated her accusation) before asking me to write her a ticket and then meet him at his car. I concluded my encounter with the angry woman and bid her ado before strolling over to Lt’s window, acting as though I truly didn’t believe I was about to be terminated for whatever it was I did. \n\n“Lt. Thompson said one of his guys has it from two confidential informants that there is a hit out for you in the barrio.”\n\nI was more impressed than frightened. “Really? For me? What did I do to deserve the honor?”\n\n“Apparently you locked up their boss, some coke dealer named Jose or something. There is a group of guys who deliver for him and they are upset you took away their sole method of making money.”\n\nI reviewed my mental Rolodex of “coke dealing Joses” but I couldn’t place anyone who may have had it in for me. “Ok, so, what do I do?”\n\n“Well, you’ll finish your shift there today but I’m taking you out of the area until we build a little more on these guys. If you feel up to it and think you can trust them, maybe reach out to some of your contacts in the neighborhood and see if they’ve heard anything. Just make sure to have someone else there with you and don’t do anything stupid.” \n\nThat sucked. I was at home in my area. “Ok, I’ll call Lopez once we’re done and meet him at the school.” I told Lt. \n\nWe parted ways (he never even gave me a pat on the back for writing tickets!) and I called Devon, asking if he’d cover me on an interview before dialing Lopez’s number. He picked up on the third ring. \n\n“EMR! Wassup dude? I was just gonna call you, homes. There’s rumors!” Apparently he’d already heard. \n\n“You already heard about my hit and hadn’t called me yet? Thanks a lot, man.” I tried to sound genuinely angry with him but don’t know if I pulled it off. \n\n“Well, I figured you cop dudes would already know. I’m not the only dude snitching out here, c’mon!” He was right but I didn’t tell him as much. Instead I made an appointment and he agreed to meet me in our spot behind the elementary school in the barrio.\n\nDevon was busy writing a report when I told him the news of my death threat.\n\n“Cool.” He said without even glancing up from his report. \n\n“That’s it? I mean, I could be in some dude’s cross hairs right now man! You don’t think that’s a big deal?”\n\n“Let me know if you see any floating red dots on your forehead so I can roll up my window first. Don’t want any brains getting on my larceny report.” Devon was a jerk.\n\nLopez slinked up a moment later and eased into my passenger seat. \n\n“So,” he whispered, even though there was no one but the heartless Devon within earshot, “these two dudes, Chompira and Vampiro, they want to ambush your ass. They’re pissed you locked up La Sombra last week. He was paying them five bucks a delivery and now they got to go work the day labor site again.”\n\nThat was why I hadn’t remembered the name. La Sombra was how I knew Jose the coke dealer. His street name was how all the guys in the barrio referred to him and it wasn’t until after I had caught him holding an eight ball of rocks that I learned his true name. \n\n“Chompira and Vampiro? Sounds like Count Chocula’s less successful brothers. You have any more on them?” \n\n“Nah, man. They’re drunks, I don’t even know where they’re laying down at. Chompira's got a girl 'round the way though. They were talking mad shit about you, El Chele, last night. Trying to get dudes to help them off you but no one wanted to help.” \n\n“Well, thanks for not wanting to kill me. That’s a testament to our friendship, huh?” I laughed and punched Lopez’s shoulder.\n\n“Yeah man. That and you are the only cop who pays around here.” \n\n“Gee, thanks. I love you too man.” I then realized I didn’t have anything to pay Lopez with as a thank you for the info. My narcotics detective connection was late on giving me more pay funds. A scratch outside Lopez’s door distracted me from the problem at hand. \n\n“Dude! It’s a dog!” Lopez opened the door and a small, scraggly mutt jumped in and sat on his lap like it belonged there. “I think he likes me!”\n\nI put my hand out for the dog to sniff and checked for a collar. He had none, nor did he have an ear tattoo. “Well, if you want him, consider him payment for the time being. Go get him a collar and some food.”\n\n“Really? I can have him?” Lopez was elated.\n\n“Yeah, sure. He doesn’t have a collar, probably lives on the street. He seems nice enough, just needs a bath is all. Have at it!”\n\n“Hell yeah! Thanks dude.” He hopped out of the car and started walking away, trailed by the mangy mongrel. “C’mon Pepe, let’s go chase a cat!” The two disappeared around the corner. \n\n“Did you just pay a CI with a stray dog?” Devon asked.\n\n“Easier than waiting for the animal warden to come pick it up. At least it has a home now. And there’s no paperwork!” I was proud of my resourcefulness. \n\n“Damn, that’s pretty good.” Apparently Devon was impressed too.\n\nSeveral days passed and I heard no new info on the threat. I was getting antsy in the new, slower area I had been assigned and went to my boss to complain. \n\n“I need to get back to work in the barrio. My mojo is off.” Austin Powers had just come out so everyone was using words like “mojo”… right?\n\n“Well, I haven’t heard anything from Lt. Thompson. I’ll make some calls. You can reach out to your guy too; meet him if you have to.” I was dismissed for the boss to make his calls. I made my own on the way to my car. \n\n“Lopez: meet me at the spot.” \n\nI made my way to the school via a route that took me through the barrio. It felt like I was trespassing there, as though everyone I passed knew there were a couple guys looking to track me down and do me harm. That feeling was quickly usurped by dread when I noticed a sign taped to a telephone pole:\n\n“Lost Dog – Answers to Cocoa – White, Small, Mixed breed. Reward.” The poster was punctuated with a photo of Pepe and a phone number to call if anyone found the missing pooch. Lopez wasn’t going to be happy.\n\nDevon backed me up again and I was asking him how my area had been doing in my absence. “It’s the same, man. It doesn’t matter you’re not here.” He’s a realist if not the most sensitive of friends.\n\nLopez came lopping up to my car and took his spot in the passenger seat. “When did you get them?” He asked.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Chompira and Vampiro. They’re gone. You didn’t lock them up?” Lopez was giving us more credit than we were due. \n\n“Not that I know of. Can you dig more info up on them? Get me a picture or something at least?” \n\n“I’ll try, man. They’re gone though. Don’t know if I’ll get anything.” Lopez went to leave and I stopped him.\n\n“How’s Pepe doing?” \n\n“Man! That little asshole pisses all over my house, man. Fuck that dog. I love him though. He’s cute as shit.” \n\n“Well, I guess it sucks you’re going to have to give him back to his owner then, huh?” I broke the news maybe too bluntly but waited for Lopez’s reaction.\n\n“Huh? Oh, you mean the signs. Nah, man; Pepe’s happy with me. I’m gonna keep him. His owner should’ve been better at keeping him safe.” Lopez crossed his arms and shook his head, resolute in his decision. \n\n“You can’t keep him. He’s someone’s pet. Besides, they’re offering a reward.”\n\n“He is someone’s pet. *Mine*.” Lopez made to exit the car. \n\n“If you don’t give him up, I might have to call the owner man. I’m not keeping someone’s lost pet from them.” \n\nLopez waved a dismissive hand back at me as he walked away. “I’ll think about it!”\n\nDevon looked to me from his cruiser as I pondered my next move on both the death threat and found dog fronts. “You kidnapped a dog and paid a CI with it.”\n\n“No crap.” I replied, angry my avoidance of paperwork had led to this moral dilemma. “And shut up.” \n\nLopez called me an hour later. “Dude. Those guys are gone. They ran to Mexico or something. Chompira’s girl said he was scared you were coming for him. She said they knew you knew they wanted to kill you. I think I’m gonna hook up with that bitch tonight.” Lopez was always on the prowl for easy sexual prey and if he was going to hook up with my adversary’s girlfriend, odds were probably good he was really out of the area.\n\n“Awesome news, thanks for digging. Any decisions made about the dog?” \n\n“Oh, I took that dickhead back right after I got home. He ate my fuckin’ Jordan’s man! Them shits were expensive!” \n\n“Sorry to hear that man, but you did the right thing. Did you get a good reward?” I was proud of the grown-up decision of my ward.\n\n“Nah, man. His owner’s this crazy old lady, saggy tits and smelled like cigarettes. She gave me five bucks and a coupon to Applebees. I was gonna press her for more cash but I was afraid she was gonna try and mount me like a stallion.” He laughed. “I got the hell outa there before I had to call you and report a rape!” He had a very high opinion of himself.\n\nI was about to apologize for not having more pay funds for him when some movement out my windshield caught my eye. A twenty dollar bill was tumbling over the asphalt and ended up getting caught on a piece of garbage in the gutter. My internal light bulb went off again. \n\n“Hey, you remember that twenty bucks you accidently dropped the other day?” I asked, hoping he’d pick up on my “wink-wink” cues over the phone.\n\n“My what? Twenty bucks?”\n\n“Yeah, the twenty bucks that just blew past my cruiser and is stuck to a Big Gulp cup a block from your house. You know: the one I don’t want to have to write a found property report about. That twenty bucks you lost that you could just come over real quick and grab. You remember, right?” I hoped I wouldn’t have to spell it out for him.\n\n“Ohhh, yeah! My twenty bucks! Yeah, I do remember losing that. I’ll be right over and grab it. Thanks for “finding it” for me, officer.” \n\nIt was another perfect resolution for both of us. I always looked out for everyone’s best interests. \n",

        "text": "This happened a few months ago and I have wanted to share this with you; however I have been quite busy and involved with my work.\n\nI work in a small but dense city in Washington State with a high military population and low crime rate. It was an exciting night for me, I was off FTO and I was eager to prove that I was ready to be on my own. I still had a shadow officer on duty to assist me if needed, but if I could avoid calling him I wanted to. The day had been really slow and I was unable to find anything interesting. I had written a single ticket for speeding and gone to a call for a stolen bike. Almost 9 hours into my 12 hour shift I had still not managed to find anything. It was just dead… Tuesday night in a small town I guess.\n\n0255, it was past DUI o’clock and I was frustrated that I had not been able to test my metal on the first night. I was just waiting at this point for the night to be over so I could go home and try again the next day when I saw a single light coming down (main road). At first I thought it was a busted headlight and was excited to make a stop when I realized it was a motorcycle. Disappointed I slouched down into my seat and waited for it to pass.\nI was parked off the road with all my lights off and partially hidden from view. Because of this the cyclist obviously did not see me and as he rounded the corner onto the long straight stretch I was watching, he gunned it and quickly doubled the speed limit. Ecstatic I jumped into action and began to chase down the motorcycle. \nI caught up to him about a half mile down the road at a red light. I run his plates and the bike comes back clean. When the light turns and we clear the intersection I activate my overhead lights and he stops immediately. \n\nI call out “Unit11 radio”.. \n\n“Unit11” the radio chimes back. \n\n“ I will be out with Adam Boy Charles 123 on (main road)”\n\n“0259” they confirm.\n\nAt that moment the driver gets off his bike, takes two steps toward me and stands at parade rest with his helmet still on. And for the first time since I believed in monsters under my bed I got a feeling in my stomach. A feeling of pure terror and anxiety. I didn’t know why all I knew was that I did not feel right about the situation. I still don’t know if it was my arrogance or just my ego, but despite the feeling I decided not to call my shadow and make contact anyway.\n\nThis guy was big too, Easily 6’3 and 250lbs. I used the PA system in my car to ask the driver to keep his hands visible and to remove his helmet. He brought his hands up and folded his arms while walking back to his bike and began leaning on it. Helmet still on. I then stepped out of my car and again asked him to remove his helmet. He waited about a second and a half and then complied. I approached the man very cautiously and asked him how he was doing. He ignored the question and just stared at me as if he was looking right through me.\n\nI decided to skip all the pleasantries and said “Hey I watched you take off back there and you got going really fast. In fact you got over double the speed limit.” \n\nHe groaned and asked “So can we just get on with this?” \n\nI just kinda chuckled and said “Sure, License, registration, and proof of insurance please.” \n\nHe said “I don’t need insurance for a motorcycle” \n\nHe was right and embarrassed by my mistake I corrected myself. He shuffled through some paperwork he had in a box on the back of the bike for a few moments then stopped and said “Listen I don’t think I have my license but here is the registration”. \n\nThen the nightmare began. As I reached for the paper in his hand he grabbed my left wrist and swung something at my chest with his left hand. I only saw a quick glint of what I assumed was a knife. It hit me hard and cold right below my armpit. I didn’t feel any pain and didn’t think I was even cut. Immediately I pushed into him to gain control of his left hand I missed it and was struck again. This time I felt the blade deep in my right arm. It struck me just above my elbow. It stung with a white hot heat. \n\nI thought at that moment that I might die there. All I could think of was how stupid I was not calling for backup. I could not reach the emergency button on my radio and I knew that no backup was coming. I was alone and had to live. I couldn't die there, not now, not like this!\n\nI managed to grab his left wrist, him and I began to battled over the weapon. We turned and struggled for what felt like a lifetime but were about 4-5 seconds. We had moved a few paces toward my car and I finally felt the knife slip from his hand. At that moment I tried to break from his grip and go for my gun. Luckily I was left handed and my gun arm was uninjured. As I broke free he pushed me hard and I lost my footing falling backwards. There was a shallow ditch to the side of the road that I fell down and rolled over. I rushed to get back to my feet and felt like he was going to be right back with the knife. \n\nWhen I rose up I drew my gun and tried to acquire him in my sight picture, but couldn’t see him. I hadn’t even heard the bike start but I heard it as it roared out of there. He left at a high rate of speed and I ran to get back to my car. Now the only thing I was feeling was pure rage and my adrenaline numbed any pain I might have otherwise been feeling.\n\nI finally got on my radio and yelled “I need help! I’ve been stabbed” I slammed my car in drive and began to chase after him. I radioed “I am in pursuit of a black Harley headed south on (main road)”. I heard “Unit8” answer the call. Unit8 began to ask me if I was okay. I told him I was fine and after sharing some expletives explained that I was not going to let this asshole go. \n\nI could still see the Bikes lights about 3-400 yards ahead of me. I was gaining on him as he wound through the narrow street. We approached the center of town and as he went to blow through a red light a silver car pulled out in front of him. It was unreal how fast his body disappeared over the car. It immediately blended with the dark night sky and was gone. I locked up my breaks to stop in time. I radioed “He had stuck a vehicle on (main road) and (cross street)”.\n\nI got out of my car and ran to the aid of the driver that had been hit. He was fine but he gave me a look that made me realize how not fine I was. I looked down at myself and immediately realized that I was not in a good place. My right side was covered in my own blood from my armpit to my shoes. I looked down the road for the biker’s body and couldn’t see anything. Sure he was dead I walked back to my car and sat down next to it leaning on my door. I radioed for and ambulance and said that I was hurt bad. \n\nNot 20 seconds later Unit8 arrived. I will never forget the look on his face when he saw me. It was the look my father gave me once when I broke my arm. It was a look of helpless fear. I told him that I couldn’t find the suspect. I told him he must be dead. He told me not to worry about it just to sit still and keep pressure on my wounds. In no time the entire area began to light up. Units form the County, State Patrol, and neighboring cities began to pour in from everywhere. They began looking for the suspect and tending to the victim who was struck with the bike. \n\nThe ambulance soon arrived and I was taken to the nearest hospital. Things kind of go fuzzy for me from there, but the jest of it was I received some blood and a bunch of stitches. No vital organs were struck but the knife did puncture/miss my vest just under the armpit. The stab wound was 2.5 inches deep and did not hit my lungs. The wound to my arm was bad looking, but superficial. 38 stitches later I was stable and spent 2 days in the hospital. My mom was so mad at me for scaring her. I can’t imagine how scared she was when she gets a call around 4am saying that her son was in the hospital with serious stab wounds. \n\nI got the rest of the story when Unit8 came to visit. Apparently they had begun to think that the driver had escaped because they were not able to locate his body. K9 units were brought in and they couldn’t find him either. 3 hours passed before the sky got light enough to find him. This is the truth I shit you not. He had flown about 300feet down the road and hit a telephone pole. He had impaled himself on the post used to climb the pole and hung there. It was only when it was light enough out that an officer finally found him. \n\nThat was the scariest night of my life and I have learned a lot from it. I wish I could say I am sad that the dude was killed, but I feel no remorse for the asshole who tried to take my life. I do however have regrets about that night. I was stupid to let my ego affect my decision that night. I should have called for backup. I also wish I had listened to my gut and not approached the man alone. I had every opportunity to get backup and the decision not to call almost cost me my life. I just count my lucky stars that I got out if it with nothing but scars and 2 weeks medical leave. I am back to work now and off shadow. I would like to think I am more rounded, but only time will tell. \n",

        "text": "Brandon is a quirky dude. \n\nHe’s paranoid to a fault, can take a joke with the best of them, and if you allow him to, will spend hours regaling you with stories about building boats while growing up in upstate New York. His multiple buttons are so tempting to push and paranoia so great, that my current means of messing with him consists solely of normal, day-to-day conversation. Inevitably he’ll wonder what I’m up to (nothing) and glance around nervously waiting for me to spring whatever prank I’m planning (I’m not). \n\nI’ve mastered the art of tormenting Brandon, but I’m not the original king in the category. No, I’d have to give that honor to Ryan and his various schemes to drive Brandon up the wall. Of all his ventures into the world of applying mental anguish upon Brandon, my favorite was Mr. Bob. \n\nBrandon hated Mr. Bob with a passion, much to the joy of Ryan and me. It was the utter absurdity of the situation I enjoyed best: Brandon’s ire was directed at Ryan’s hand, specifically when it bore a particular [accessory]( http://www.gagsuperstore.com/images/finsp121.JPG) and was mouthing along to Ryan’s donated falsetto voice. It was a sight to behold, Ryan – a huge, beast of a man, hulking in his cruiser with a mischievous smile he couldn’t hold back – would slowly protrude his hand puppet out his window and into the general vicinity of Brandon’s upheld newspaper. \n\n“Hey Brandon, what’cha reading?” Somehow, Ryan’s voice hit an octave that would have made a eunuch soprano jealous. \n\n“Not now, Mr. Bob. Leave me alone.” Ryan would ignore anything Brandon would say if it wasn’t addressed to Mr. Bob. \n\n“Oh, sorry to bother you. Just thought you might be reading something interesting.”  Think Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo’s voice. Ryan’s impersonation was very similar. \n\n“Dammit Mr. Bob! I’m just reading about the stock market. Leave me alone!”\n\n“Oh, ok. Yeah, the recent market drops have been keeping me up at night. I’m concerned for my retirement portfolio.” Mr. Bob lamented.\n\n“You’re telling me. My Microsoft shares crapped the bed last week. I’m thinking about dumping it for some – goddammit Mr. Bob, shut up!” Frequently these exchanges ended with Brandon angrily speeding out of the parking lot trailed by uproarious laughter from me and Ryan. \n\nThe climax of Mr. Bob’s annoying career occurred one winter morning. Immediately following roll call, Brandon had to retire to a bathroom stall for some personal time. The odiferous cavern was a place no normal man would go to wreak torment upon a friend or colleague, but Mr. Bob was normal man. Slowly, a googly-eyed hand rose overtop the toilet stall. \n\n“Heeey.” It came out more creepily than I can describe here. It was as though Mr. Bob was channeling Senator Larry Craig just before his scandal in an almost identical environment as the one Ryan was tormenting Brandon in. \n\n“F off, Mr. Bob. I’ll fling my own crap at you, I swear!” The aggression rolled out from under the metal walls thicker even than the foul scent of Brandon’s digested dinner. \n\nMr. Bob recoiled at the threat, only to reemerge a moment later, this time peering up at Brandon from underneath the toilet paper dispenser. Brandon was lightning quick though, and due to the disadvantage of a lack of being able to see what his pooping target was doing, Ryan was unable to prevent him from snatching the plastic puppet from his finger. \n\n“NOOOOOO!!!” Mr. Bob’s disembodied voice echoed in the small, tiled bathroom. \n\nContemptuous laughter erupted from the stall and Ryan and I made a hasty retreat from the smell, no longer having a reason to endure it. \n\n“Dude! He’s got Mr. Bob! What are you going to do now?” I asked Ryan, worried the gag had come to an end.\n\nRyan just smiled and casually put his hand in his pocket, a moment later pulling out an identical set of googly eyes. \n\nLater, Brandon pulled up to us while we were working on reports. “Hey guys!” He had the original Mr. Bob on his hand but was doing a much inferior job at applying a surrogate voice. “Guess who’s going to screw with *you* now?”\n\nRyan’s hand shot out with the new and improved Mr. Bob. “Who? You? Nice to meet you, hot stuff. My name’s Mr. Bob.”\n\nBrandon raged and peeled out of the parking lot. \n\nA few minutes of patting Ryan’s back on a prank well executed and I was back into the routine of working the street. I was just about to self-dispatch on an accident in a neighbor’s area when I heard Brandon on the radio.\n\n“4Alpha60, foot pursuit!” He was a ways from me but I immediately hit my lights and siren and sped in his direction. \n\n“4Alph60, one… Hispanic male… blue shirt… blue jeans… heading North… towards Oak!” His choppy due to his sprint and I gunned the Crown Victoria’s engine, weaving through traffic to help my partner however I could. \n\n“Alpha2, start K9 and helicopter. 4Alpha60, advise charges when you can.” Sarge was calm and collected on the radio.\n\n“4Alpha60… at this time… possibly gang… activity.”\n\nI pulled up to Brandon’s cruiser and scanned the area north of me for any indication of where exactly he might have run. \n\n“4Alpha60. We’re in a patch of woods… he’s bedding down in here somewhere.” Brandon panted into the radio. \n\nRyan pulled up a moment later, then Devon, and together, after securing Brandon’s cruiser, we took off into the small forest in the direction Brandon had indicated. A sign at the opening of a trail indicated this stretch of trees in the otherwise urbanized area had a name. \n\n“Heh heh,” Giggled Ryan as we jogged up the path, “Birdcock Forrest. Did you guys see that?, heh.”\n\nWe found Brandon a few hundred yards in, peering into the brush, and he coordinated his plan to loop us around in a human net and catch his hiding suspect. K9 was still a good ways off and with only vague gang charges they’d be unable to deploy with any real effect anyway.\n\nWe were about to start wading through the brambles when Brandon stopped us and addressed Ryan. “Wait. Should we try it?”\n\n“Try what?” Ryan whispered back.\n\n“The K9 trick!”\n\n“Oh, yes. Yes we should try that.” Ryan giggled like a school girl as he stepped back onto the trail then hid behind a tree. Brandon positioned his hands like a cone around his mouth.\n\n“Come out now or I’ll send in the dog!” He yelled in the general direction he thought his bad guy might be hiding. His order coincided with Ryan’s dead on impersonation of a frothing-mad German shepherd.  \n\nA second later, snapping twigs drew our attention to the fleeing man. He was making a break back towards the road. Brandon was closest and immediately gave chase, quickly catching the guy and tackling him into the remnants of a snow bank a plow had left on the shoulder of the road. He was quickly cuffed and Brandon gave him a pat-down. \n\n“Man! You all bitches didn’t even have a dog?!?” He was angry to be the first victim of a trick that had never worked on anyone before. \n\n“Ryan’s part terrier, if it makes you feel any better.” I told him. \n\nBrandon pulled a smushed snack cake from the guy’s pocket. “Was this your lunch?” \n\n“Nah, man. I don’t know what that is, pig. I didn’t steal nothing.” He spat back at Brandon with contempt.\n\n“I never said you *stole* it. Feeling a little guilty are you?” Brandon looked over the package and found an orange price tag, similar to those used by the convenience store up the street. “Well, right now you’re being detained for disorderly conduct and I’m going to find out where you took this from.” He stood the guy up and put him in his cruiser. \n\nBrandon explained what had happened prior to the foot pursuit. He had been traveling up the road and noticed the runner walking on the shoulder of the road in the same direction. The guy was employing his “thug march” and was throwing gang signs at an apprehensive man walking from the other way, trying to avoid contact with the aggressive pedestrian but unable to cross the road due to traffic volume. Brandon pulled up alongside the gang member and asked what was going on when the guy took off. \n\nRyan and I followed Brandon to the convenience store and kept watch on his prisoner while he tracked down a manager to review the surveillance tape. \n\nThe guy in Brandon’s car was yelling incoherently and I told Ryan not to worry about it as the in-car video was recording the whole thing. His eyes sparkled for a moment and the mischievous grin he bore indicated he had just had an epiphany. He scampered to the driver’s door and sat down behind the wheel. \n\n“Hey dude, you going to calm down?” \n\n“Nah, man. I aint even broke the law! You all punk asses just looking to hold me down.” It was all spite and venom from the back seat. \n\n“Well, you can’t be walking down the road throwing gang signs at people and walking up on them all threatening like. Also, probably not a good idea to run from the cops.” \n\n“Shut up, faggot. I don’t gotta talk to you.” The man puckered his face into a grimace and turned to look out the window.  \n\nSlowly, a large hand with white googly eyes rose up to stare at the gang member through the Plexiglas partition. “You don’t need to talk to the officer, but you can talk to me.” Mr. Bob told the man in a kind, high pitched voice.\n\n“Get that shit out of here, man.” The thug addressed Ryan, clearly forgoing the rules of engagement deployed by Mr. Bob. \n\n“What? Don’t feel like talking? That’s cool. I can sing a song if you like.” \n\n“Nah, man. Get that thing out of my face!” The man was getting agitated.\n\n“Oh, ok. I can take a hint. Why are you so mad though? You seem really angry at me.” Mr. Bob’s psycho-analysis side was coming out. \n\n“No shit I’m mad. You bitches locked me up for no reason.” The man was now addressing Mr. Bob. \n\n“Aw, shucks. Sorry about that. You shouldn’t be breaking the law out here though. If you had just talked to the cop, I bet you’d already be home. You have a home, right?” Mr. Bob was on the verge of a breakthrough.\n\n“Nah, man. I live on the streets. I ain’t even allowed back home.” The man hung his head with the revelation.\n\n“Oh, that’s terrible. Are you having family troubles? Your girl kick you out?” Mr. Bob’s falsetto had a magical ability to break through the man’s crusty exterior. \n\n“Yeah, man. She kicked me out after I hit her. I was wrong, y’know, but she pissed me off. I ain’t never had a stable house to live in. Came here when I was twelve and had to learn the ropes myself.” He was sniffling now, and wiping his eyes on his oversized winter coat. “It’s hard out here, man. I only stole that shit ‘cause I’m hungry.” \n\nRyan’s eyes went wide as he realized he had just elicited a confession from the man via the use of a hand puppet. “Dude,” he hissed to me, “I didn’t even read him Miranda!” \n\n“I just want to go back home and see my mom. I got nothing left here in America. I’m tired of all this bullshit; fighting with those 18th street punks, sleeping in laundry rooms, police messing with me. I’m done!” The man was now openly crying and spilling his soul to Ryan’s still raised hand. Ryan made an [expression that clearly showed he wanted the guy to stop](http://misterimmortal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/UHOh.jpg).\n\n“Just take me to jail, already. I did it. I stole the HoHo’s.” He was now addressing me and Ryan but Mr. Bob still stood tall, eyes wide with rapt attention. \n\nRyan cleared his throat. “Uh… ok. I’ll go get Officer Brandon.” He looked to me with concerned eyes as he exited the cruiser. \n\nJust then, Brandon came bursting out of the store. “Got him! I’ve got the tape. He stole the HoHo’s, I’ve got proof. They’re going to prosecute too.” He was taken aback by our lack of enthusiastic response. “What?”\n\n“We uhh… we know. He told us.” I said. “Well, he didn’t tell *us*, per se. He told… someone else.” \n\nBrandon looked confused but that quickly turned to anger when he noticed Ryan’s hand. “You sons of bitches.”\n\nThe thug got his wish – combined with his previous convictions, the theft of the $.99 snack cakes rose to a level where his plea of guilt equaled a jail sentence long enough to send him packing to his home country via our friendly ICE agents. \n\nBrandon was able to elicit a proper confession, under Miranda, on the way to jail. I’d like to think that wouldn’t have been possible, however, without the assistance of his favorite hand puppet breaking the ice first.\n",

        "text": "I’m going to break some ground here and be the first to use the [Suspect] tag! \n_____________________________\n\nI was an average student in high school. Well, maybe average is an overstatement. I was an *OK* student in high school. Something in my brain hadn’t clicked during puberty and the idea of actually studying was as repulsive to me as the thought of actually showering in gym class with all the guys exploring the depths of their new found hormones. \n\nHomework? Homework for me was figuring out what excuse I could come up with the next day to get partial credit for something I scribbled down just before class began. Somehow, even with all my self-imposed hurdles, I managed to graduate with a low “B” GPA. Anyways, if it wasn’t obvious by my aforementioned feelings towards school in general, I’ll put it bluntly: much to the chagrin of my parents, high school wasn’t about getting an education for me. High school was all about the sports.\n\nOh, I still think about my high school athletic career. I’ll be sitting in bed at night, unable to sleep after working a long evening shift, and reminisce, AL Bundy-like, over my years on the football team. Or maybe about my time throwing shot-put or discus, or my stint on the wrestling team or gymnastics team, or when I did the high jump on varsity track and field. Those were the good old days: when the gaudy patch on your overly-expensive letterman jacket gave you status; when you were high-fived in the hallways on Fridays because you were one of the chosen varsity football starters who was allowed to wear their jersey throughout the school day; when you held court at the day-long track meet because your event was over in the first twenty minutes and you had the foresight to pack a grill and hamburgers and flirt with the girls hurdle team. It was after a long practice session of shot put that this story takes place. \n\nMy buddy, Snatch, usually didn’t need a ride home. His usual ride, however, had been absent from school that day, so he asked if I could assist him with getting home. I was old for my grade, having a fall birthday, and was one of the few people in my class year that had a car. Snatch was two years ahead of me and had many of the same interests in sports and extracurricular. We were fast friends but I was always on the lookout for ways to impress him for want of gaining status with the upper-classman. \n\n“This is your car?” He asked, taken aback by the visage that was presented by my 1986 Ford Thunderbird. The navy blue paint was flaking off all over it, revealing an ugly yellowish primer sub-coat. One of my friends had scratched a curse word into the passenger door with a rock and I wasn’t in any rush to fix it. There was a deep dent in the hood from a time when I had tried to dive across it, 70’s cop show style, to impress some of my friends. The interior was all stained cloth and deteriorating, sun-faded paneling which had the autograph of almost every passenger I had driven scratched into it somewhere. My Blaupunkt CD player was the most expensive accessory in the car and it pumped out too-loud Beastie Boys and Tribe Called Quest tracks with a frequency akin to a New York hip-hop station.  My pride and joy was an electric horn I bought out of a JC Whitney catalog that included several animal noises and a microphone connected to a PA so you could talk to pedestrians. \n\n“Yeah.” I told him, not sure if his slack jawed visual inspection was a good thing or a bad thing for me socially. \n\n“Awesome.” He finally concluded, and jumped into the passenger seat.\n\nBefore we could pull out of the lot, another buddy flagged me down. “Dude! Pat, that dick, just left me behind, man. Could you drive me home?” Chad was another “thrower”, the term we used to differentiate us field event participants from the runners. I couldn’t leave him in a time of need. \n\n“Sure, hop in.” Snatch didn’t exit, only leaned forward enough to provide a gap in the rolled-down window for Chad to slither through in to the back seat. \n\nSoon, we were charging down the road, windows down, sunroof open, and Notorious B.I.G. angrily filling our ears with lyrics about Glocks and large bottomed women. Snatch was the first to notice my strange cargo at his feet. \n\n“Are these… Are these bottle rockets!?!” He held up the pack of fireworks, illegal in our jurisdiction (but fuck the po-lice, amiright?) and turned them over in his hands. \n\n“Psh, yeah! Of course they are!” I can’t remember how I obtained them, but that didn’t matter at the moment as Snatch looked at me with reverence in his eyes. \n\n“Can I shoot ‘em?” He asked, hanging in the air for my reply. Being the son of a cop, a warning bell went off in my head urging me to be the stick in the mud that my father would be proud of. Peer pressure had the upper hand however. \n\n“Of course, yeah, sure you can shoot them. That’s why they’re here, right?” Play it cool, EMR, you have this guy eating out of the palm of your hand. \n\n“Dude! Use this wrapping paper tube!” Chad passed forward the launching vessel from the back seat and waited eagerly for the show. \n\nSnatch dug around in the grocery bag that he had found the bottle rockets and located the lighter I had packaged with the ordnance. “Ready?” He asked us. I nodded; Chad gave a loud “WHOOP!” The bottle rocket screamed from the cardboard tube and spiraled into the air before exploding in front of us as we drove down the residential street. \n\n“Awesome.” Chad remarked from the back seat. I just smiled and went along with the shenanigans. \n\nThe party continued as we dropped off Chad at his home. Snatch shot a rocket at him as a farewell gift and erupted in to laughter as we pulled away. We waited for a light to turn and let us back onto the major road Chad lived off of. Our stock of explosives was dwindling. “I’m going to shoot them all at once, cool?” Snatch asked.\n\n“Yeah man, whatever you want.” I knew I had won some brownie points with the upperclassman and would gladly cash in on my new-found popularity the next day.\n\nThe light turned just as Snatch successfully lit the remaining rockets and they shot off at an angle half way through my turn. “That was so cool. You’re going to need to give me a ride every day.” He told me as he leaned back in his seat, content with his day’s ration of exploding things. \n\nI didn’t answer his request because I had noticed a car speed up from the stop light and begin to tailgate me. “Look at this jerk.” I said as I changed lanes from the right to left to allow him to pass. He followed suit, though, and shadowed me into the left lane. I signaled and changed lanes again, and again, he followed. I then noticed his angry expression in my rearview. He was yelling into a cell phone. \n\n“I think this guy’s following us.” I told Snatch. He spun around and stared at the middle-aged man who glared back and continued to yell into his phone. \n\n“He looks pissed. “ Snatch remarked. “Pull off here and we can take a back way.” \n\nI did as he requested and the man followed suit, staying close enough to my bumper that I couldn’t make out his front tag in my mirrors. “He’s still following us!” I was getting nervous now. \n\n“Turn here, now there!” Snatch was getting into a state of fear as well and began guiding us through the now-foreign to me streets. The man kept following. \n\n“Pull over here.” He indicated a driveway and I did as I was told. He jumped out the door and took off sprinting back the way we had come, cutting through a yard and hopping a fence before I realized what had happened. I was alone now. \n\nI gunned my engine which caused the passenger door to slam shut and made my way through twisting residential roads, praying I’d come to a landmark I recognized and finally making it to a light onto a road I knew would lead me back to my house. I was waiting nervously in the right turn lane as the man pulled up alongside me in the left turn lane. He stared at me, anger burning in his cold, black eyes, and he flicked me off before pulling into traffic, running the red light and causing a car to blare its horn at him. \n\nAt least he was gone. \n\nI made my right turn and pulled out onto the road that would lead me home, glad my tail was finally gone. A moment later, however, I checked my mirror – still nervous from the prior encounter – and noticed a cop car following. \n\nUp to that point in my life, my interactions with cops had been purely in the “good” category. I had tagged along with my dad to the station, met his co-workers, been to the holiday parties, was the first kid to be fingerprinted in the department’s program to pass out those “Who Am I” cards in case I went missing, and so on and so forth. I knew this time was going to be different and my stomach dropped as I noticed the blue-and-red overheads light me up. I immediately pulled over. \n\nIt seemed to take forever for the cop to make his way up to my window but when he did, I greeted him with the package from the bottle rockets. “Here. There aren’t any more. I’m sorry for being stupid.” I knew I was had, why fight it. \n\nThe cop just stared at me through his Ray Bans, face stern and jaw jutting out in an intimidating fashion. It was a moment of utter discomfort and I could feel myself physically balling up in a defense mechanism triggered to just make it stop. Finally he spoke.\n\n“Get the hell out’a the car.” It was more of a growl than something a human would use to communicate but I obeyed without hesitation. The cop stepped back to let me out and I exited my door, cars zooming past on the forty-five mile per hour roadway. He grabbed me by the shoulder, angrily, and turned me to the rear of my car before shoving me with both hands in my back and sending me stumbling to the trunk. He sighed in indignation as he forced my wrist onto the trunk and spread my feet with a swift kick to the ankle. He pat me down roughly and when he was done, spun me around to face him. \n\nHe put his nose so close to my own that it felt as though I was only breathing in his exhales. “You stupid, worthless, sack of shit. Do you know how good of a man your father is? Do you know what his entire squad just did when they realized the lookout for the felony vehicle was *his* car? Do you know your bullshit antics might cost him his job if not definitely some respect?”\n\n I hadn’t even thought that I might be driving through my dad’s patrol area. He was, at the time, the street supervisor for a group of about ten cops and apparently my tailgating parasite had provided my tag which was broadcast as a lookout. I didn’t know how to react to the situation. An angry, abusive cop in my face telling me I might be the downfall of my father’s career and cause of my family’s economic failure. In shock, I slipped into super-passive mode and averted my eyes, a shit-eating grin spread on my lips and I could feel the blood draining from my face.\n\n“Why the fuck are you smiling?!? You think this is funny??!” The veins on his neck bulged as he screamed at me and bits of spittle flecked onto my face. I know how marines feel in boot camp when they step out of line. \n\n“N-no…” Is all I could reply.\n\n“I should drag your scrawny ass down this ditch and kick the living shit out of your worthless ass so your dad doesn’t have to. You’re not worth him scuffing his boots! I’ll stomp you until you shit blood and pray for the mercy of death!”\n\nHe shoved his finger into the gap just below my collar bone and was breathing heavier than a sumo wrestler in the home stretch of a marathon. \n\nSalvation appeared suddenly in another cop. The screaming, wannabe drill sergeant was tapped on the shoulder and he wheeled around to confront whoever it was that was so rude as to interrupt his verbal assault. \n\n“Smitty, take a breath man. Chill.” The new cop seemed much nicer and I found the ability to once again make eye contact with another human being.\n\n“No, Harding, no! Screw that! This piece of shit dishonored his father! I should kick his ass!” I was left to listen in on their conversation while my arm regained feeling after Smitty’s pressure point application. \n\n“I got it, man. Lt is on his way. Go back to your cruiser.” Harding looked to me with raised eyebrows as Smitty, fuming, resigned to stomp back to his cruiser. \n\n“Don’t worry about him. He’s a little hot headed.” Harding said as he approached me. “So, fireworks, huh? Bet that was awesome.” He smiled at me and I felt some of the color return to my face.\n\n“It was stupid. I’m an idiot. Sorry to be causing you guys trouble.” I mumbled.\n\n“Bah! No biggie, it’s dead out here tonight anyway. Hopefully your dad doesn’t go apeshit when he gets here.” Harding looked back towards his cruiser. “Well, guess we’ll find out in a second. Have a seat in your car and I’ll talk to your old man.”\n\nI sat back behind the wheel and watched Harding walk up and talk with my dad. Surprisingly, he was smiling and the two spoke for a few moments before Smitty joined them. Smitty gestured to my car then made a Homer-Simpson-strangling motion to which my dad waved a dismissive hand. The three then turned to the car and my dad must have thanked them and bid them farewell before he started his walk towards my shame. \n\nI braced myself and looked straight ahead. \n\nMy dad leaned down into the window but didn’t look at me directly. “Go straight home. Now. Don’t you dare stop on the way, just go. Now!” He told the ground. \n\nI didn’t reply, just put the car in gear and slowly pulled out into traffic. The drive home was hell. I had no idea what was in store for me and automatically began theorizing the worst. I pulled up in front of my house and saw my mom was home with my sister. I almost broke down to tears as I walked in, not wanting to break the news that we were about to lose our home due to some of my sophomoric games. My mom knew something was wrong immediately. \n\n“What? What happened? Are you ok?” She rushed to me to offer support. I told her everything in a long, unbroken, voice-quivering sentence. \n\nShe was quiet for a moment, deciding what to say. Finally, “Well. Your dad will be home for his dinner break in a few minutes. We’ll talk it over, ok?” \n\nNo, that was not ok. I was about to be murdered, I could feel it. I waited in sullen anxiousness until I heard the door open. My mom and dad spoke in quiet murmurs before he made his way to me. \n\nI’ll spare the details; it was mostly incoherent screaming anyway. The best illustration to the intensity of my ass chewing was our ancient spaniel-mutt-dog being so distressed by the commotion and tangible anger in the air that she vomited up her dinner and refused to re-ingest it, instead seeking shelter under the dining room table. \n\nYears later, I now work with Harding. He’s a cool guy but will never let me live down that terrible day. Smitty ended up getting fired for a verbal tirade spewed at some hot-shot attorney’s trophy wife. It was the final straw in a career-long list of complaints about similar incidents. \n\nThe murmurs between my mom and dad that day were actually chuckles: my dad knew he was going to lay the wood on me but felt the entire situation was actually pretty damn funny. He could have fooled me and should have won an academy award for his performance. \n\nMy big take-away was to never, ever be like Smitty. Treat people with respect and they’ll do the same. It’s still, to this day, my personal creed.\n",

        "text": "This story is from a while ago when I was an explorer for my city. I thought I could handle it all. I made sure to write it down because I will never forget it. It really opened my eyes to some of the shit you have to deal with as an officer.\n\nThe time of year was when the trees started to turn to deep pigments of color that transforms the skyline from a green pasture to a colorful collage. This day was abnormally warm as it was October and the high was expected to be in the upper 70’s. The weather was clear as a summer day, not a breeze. The temperature, color, time of day, or weather doesn’t change the job at hand. It was time to get to business.\n\nWe were assigned to the south beat, the most populous region of the city. This beat, besides its size, is quiet and calm in terms of crime. Most of the calls came in the form of medicals. It was routine for us to grab the bag, put on the gloves and start taking notes. All medicals followed the same procedure but they also all had their unique twist to them: a hurt back, sprained ankle, bleeding from limbs, etc.  If it wasn’t for another officer that day, we would have been running medical to medical. \n\nI will never know the other officer’s name, but he was taller, white male with a shaved head and spoke in a deep voice much like Morgan Freeman. It was at shift change that he called us to take charge in his case. I wasn’t given many details about where we were going or what the call was about, but the officer I was riding with did ask me if I had two pairs of gloves.  When he asked me if I had a second pair of gloves, I knew something was going to be gruesome. I recall the location being a low-density single family neighborhood near a busy street, and I distinctly remember the sight of people. It had taken us a good ten minutes to travel across the city to arrive where the other officer was. \n\nAt last, we arrived at the house. It was an off-white with dark brown trim; split level, but small. In the garage, was a black Chrysler 300, so clean you could eat off the trunk. Next to the car sat four people: two older males, a middle-aged female, and a child approximately 14 years of age. Before we got to talk to the people outside we had to talk to the officer. He greeted us with a notebook filled with barely legible notes about what was going on. The officer that was speaking was pale in his face as if he had just seen a ghost. I didn’t take much notice of it, kept my mouth shut, and did as I was told.\n\nAs we slowly walked up the black driveway, it became apparent that the four people sitting near the car had been crying for some time. All of them had a stagger in their voices and all but one was uncomfortable talking. We made some small talk with them, but didn’t ask them what was going on. While we were doing that the medical examiner arrived. This is when it struck me. We were at a death scene and the other officer needed a reliever. We informed the examiner of the information the other officer gave to us. He reviewed it carefully and with great detail explained what was about to happen.\n\nWe entered the house with extreme caution, careful not to displace any items that we saw. We were escorted down to the basement, through a narrow staircase that had many fragile items lined up around the sides of them seemingly waiting to be knocked down. When we finished our decent into the basement, a wave of extreme heat hit us. The temperature in the room was well over 80 degrees and had the smell of something so unique that you can only describe it as death. We walked slowly into the room where the body was located taking mental pictures of where items were located and what the contents of the house were. \n\nWhen we entered the room, the sight of a motionless, stiff, pale, and the obvious sight of a lifeless human became forefront. He was an older male still dressed in his pajamas and had his arms locked tight against his chest like mummy would. Upon entering the room I was quickly directed to put on a pair of gloves and then put the second pair over that pair. I was later told that even though we would have one pair of gloves on that the smell of death would still penetrate the black synthetic material and will leech onto your hands.  After putting on the second pair, I was also told that the second pair is for a mindset – they also did not do anything to prevent the smell of latching onto your hands.\n\nBeing there for the experience, I quickly asked if I could help with the examination. The medical examiner took aim at me and said in the most serious voice that you could ever imagine, “are you sure?”\n\n“Of course I’m sure,” I responded with a quiver in my voice. \n\nWith my quick response and not a thought more, we embarked on the body. We first started with a general inventory: where the body laid, where the blood pooled, and temperature. The body was stiff and cold, just as you see on TV. However, when touched, the body quickly folded in on itself as if it had been pickled. \n\nThe medical examiner did his job as he normally would, but had me doing all the physical aspects of it: moving, poking, and touching. I thought that I had done everything that a young boy could do with this body as an Explorer – I was deeply mistaken.\n\nThe examiner looked at me for a good five seconds, and then proceeded to reach into his clipboard and pull out a large needle and a vile. Little to my knowledge at the time but this was for the eye. He spoke in a soft voice to instruct me that I will not be doing this procedure as it involves invading the body. however, I was permitted to watch.  Watching this act was nothing short of a large mistake.  It started with him carefully inserting this rather large needle into the eye, under the lens and straight into the pupil. You could visibly see the needle in the middle of this man’s eye. After getting the needle inserted, he began to do something that neither of the people I was with explained to me: He started to suction out the fluid from the eyeball. While he was working, he explained to me that this is normal and easy. This time it was neither. He was trying with all his might to get this fluid out of the eye, but was unsuccessful. \n\nAfter trying again, a very loud and audible tone came screeching out of the eye. I can only describe it as a vacuum trying to suck up water. It was neither good to hear nor nice to watch some man’s eye collapse on itself just as a popped beach ball does. I cannot remember what happened next other then everything went silent (or near it), my bones became Jell-O, and my eyesight transformed into tunnel vision – I was on the verge of blacking out. I recognized that I am in a tight spot and tried to make it out the back door to get some air. Unfortunately, that plan did not go as planned because as I started to make my way to the back, I started to slam into the wall, collapsing. I don’t remember anything after that but I do recall awaking outside the home on the rear patio with the two men hovering over me making sure that I was okay and that I did not need any further assistance. \n\nA period of time had passed before I was tapped on the shoulder and was told that it was time to leave the residence, and to go back to doing our job. The body was ruled natural death, and was taken to the funeral home pending an official time.  I was relieved that I had made it out of there alive and lived to tell about it. They say you will never forget your first dead body, especially at age 16, and it’s true. I will forever hold the image of the house and body engraved in my head for the future to come.\n\nTLDR: Fuck dead bodies. I now know what to expect.\n",

        "text": "I knew that shenanigans were going to happen. I knew that I was at the bottom of the totem pole, but I did not know it would be like this. A bit of foreword here: now that I'm off FTO and on my own, I'm still figuring out what this job actually entails. We operate in the gray area between a CSO and licensed... we're like a paid fulltime reserve program.\n\nEveryone starts their shift the same: come into the office, grab a radio, grab a cell phone, and grab keys to a vehicle. Sign them all out.\n\nI get into work and sure as shit theres only one radio left (normally theres 3+). I grab it. Notice theres no antenna on it. \"Lovely\" I thought, I'd just run down to the shop and grab an antenna.  I grab the only cell phone. Not an issue, they all work. However, this one did not have a carrier for my belt. \"Well this sucks.\" I put it in my uniform pocket and grabbed keys to a vehicle. It was nice, they left me one of the new squads. \n\nGet out to the car and its dirty. Noticeably dirty. We work in the county so at the end of shift you're supposed to wash your car and fuel it.  Mine was dirty and had half a tank in it.. not good. I go through 5/8 of a tank a shift. \n\nI knew I was the rookie so I expected this. However, I was not expecting to get into the car to find no computer, no throw bag, and no med bag.\n\nFixed the latter by moving equipment from other squads going to the shop for repairs, but the computer I did not fix. As most of you know, the computer is one of my greatest tools I have. \n\nI called my FTO up and told him what was going on.. he said to \"you're the new guy, just gotta live with it for a while.\"\n\nand thus I went on with my 10.5 hour shift with no computer. Made good use of the dispatchers so I hope they still like me... :| It was a flash to in the past too with handwriting tickets\n\nI still live by the greatest advice given to me in training: read it, hear it, speak it, learn it, love it, abuse it, hate it, and protect it, but dont fuck up.",

        "text": "[Complete Transparancy: I wrote this circa 2006. But it is mine, and I did write it.]\n\nSome people believe in fate, or influences from God. Others in coincidences, or happenstance. I believe...that I'm a shit magnet.\n\nI was walking out of work last night. Thinking to myself, I should really change out. Leave my gear here. I like to keep low key to my neighbors, and not trot around in the garage in full uniform. But it was late, and I was tired. I walked straight to my truck, took my outer vest off, and slung it in the seat next to me. I'll just change at home. I'm too tired.\n\nI start driving, on the freeway, music on, and cigarette in mouth. I want my bed. Or at least my new book. I exit off on to my 16 mile stretch of deserted desert road that leads home. Two lane highway, if you will, with a gully for a median, and speed limits of 65. Although you'd be hard pressed to find anyone under 80. I begin to head west.\n\nThen, I get that click in the back of my brain that says \"Hey, something ain't right here.\" I try to focus my tired eyes. I see headlights, then tail lights, then head lights, then tail lights. Looks like someone is doing a three point turn in the middle of the lanes. Foot covers brake. I sit up. Try to come up with a rational conclusion. Now all I see is brake lights. \"Hmm, maybe someone pulled out of a canal access road I didn't know about.\" Now I can see, the car is headed west, just like me. But slower. And to the left of me. \"Wait a second!\" I'm in the #1 lane. \"There is no left of me!?!\" Holy shit fuck! He's driving west in the eastbound lanes. This is bad!\n\nInstinctively, or because I'm tired, I reach for my over head lights. Then my computer. But, oh yeah, I'm in my personal truck, which does not have such equipment. Fuck! I reach for my radio. Wait, I'm way of my city, and god knows if it will even work. I need to do something, ANYTHING, and now! I slow to pace the other car, about 20-30 feet in front of them, in my lane. I flash my brights just as fast as I can muster, and honk my horn intermittently. I figure, If i can make eastbound traffic go \"What the fuck is that guy doing?\" Maybe they'll slow for me, and then avoid a head on with him. And it works. We pass 12 cars, or rather they pass him. Two of which are semi trucks. They all move to the #2 lane to avoid what would have to be a fatal.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, he stops. Right in the lane (well, wrong in the lane would be more accurate, but he was IN the lane) and he sits there. I lock my brakes, slam it in reverse, and I'm pretty sure I hit 40 going backward. Drop it in park, grab my outer vest carrier, sling it on, and jump out of my truck.\n\nSimultaneously, I am on 911. \n\n\"911, do you have an emergency?\" \n\nYes, I have a wrong way driver headed westbound in the eastbound lanes of long country road, off of the freeway. (locations omitted because it's none of your business) \n\n\"Hold please.\" Click click click. \n\n\"State Agency, what is your emergency?\" \n\nYes, this is off duty Officer /u/Forensicunit. I have a wrong way driver stopped just west of freeway on long country road. I am an off duty officer, and I am going to make contact. \n\n\"Hold Please\" Click click click.......beeeeeeeeep. \n\nFUCK! 911 hung up on me. They are so fucking worried about who's god damn jurisdiction this is, they can't fucking send me backup?\n\n(Break to car) I have my vest out, my flashlight in one hand, and the butt of my gun in the other. I approach, like any other traffic stop. City Police Department! Show me your hands. He looks over, at, and through me. Sammy Davis Junior had less glassy eyes! \n\n\"Gimme your keys!\"\n\n \"Huh?\" \n\n\"Gimme your fucking keys.\" \n\nHe hands me his keys. Finally, something in my favor. But this guy is toasted. I mean 17 sheets to the wind, and he is big. Much bigger than I am. I'm also standing in the middle of the fast lane of a 65mph highway, wearing the blackest uniform you could make, at one o'clock in the morning.\n\nI key up my radio \"My badge Number.\" At the same time I dial 911 again. Both answer at the same time. \"My badge number, go ahead.\" \"911, do you have an emergency?\" \n\n\"Yes! This is Officer /u/forensicunit, I stopped a wrong way driver on the long country road, 1/2 mile west of the Freeway. I called 911 and they hung up on my. I have one driver detained. I need a marked unit.\" \n\n\"Long country road? Isn't County Law Enforcement Agency's jurisdiction?\" \n\n\"Look! I don't care who's jurisdiction this is. I need a back up officer NOW! Just send me someone, please!\"\n\n(On the radio)\"My badge number, did you need assistance?\" Yes. I stopped a wrong way driver on the long country road, 1/2 mile west of the freeway. If you have a City Police Department officer anywhere near by, I have the driver stopped, and he is becoming agitated with me.\"\n\n(On my phone) \"Ok officer, I am letting State Agency and Indian Community Police know, we will send someone out.\" Thank you! She disconnects.\n\n(On the radio) \"My Badge Number, I have units enroute to assist you. Again you are 1/2 mile west of long country road, west of the freeway?\" \n\n10-4!\n\n(From the car) \"What's the problem Officer?\" \n\n\"You were driving the wrong way!\" \n\n\"No I wasn't\" \n\n(???WTF???) \"Yes you were! Look, there's the road, there's the median, and you are here.\"\n\n\"No. I wasn't\" \n\nWhatever.\n\nAnd the wait. I can see 4 miles west/southwest, and 1 mile east. I can see the Freeway 3 miles in each direction. All I want to see is red and blue lights. Please. From any direction.  I don't know if you've ever had to wait for the cavalry. Not just cops, civilians too.  Have you ever been in that 'Oh shit, out of control, this is above my pay grade moment' when you call 911.  Maybe you witnessed an accident, or were the victim of a mugging.  You call for help, and you wait. And for a few minutes it feels like eternity and to some degree you feel helpless.  But then you hear it.  The distant wail of sirens.  And eventually you see flashing dots of red and blue lights on the horizon and you hear the steadily increasing sound of sirens.  And god damn, when you need it, if that isn't the sweetest sound there is.\n\nI figure I'm safer if he's in the car, cause I don't want to have to fight him, and I don't want to have to shoot him. I stand by the rear quarter panel, and alternate lighting him up and waving my flashlight at traffic so I don't get run-the-fuck over. And I wait. And I look.\n\n\"So, what's the problem officer?\" \n\nYou are driving in the wrong lanes of traffic. \n\n\"No I'm not.\" \n\nAgain, this is not debatable. You are, in fact, driving in the wrong lanes. \n\nHe points out his windshield. \"What direction is that?\" \n\nIt's west. \n\n\"Yeah, I;m just trying to get home.\" \n\n(To myself) I bet you are, buddy. I bet you are.\n\nAnd I wait. I search the black horizon for anything that resembles a friendly. And he continues to argue the fact that he did nothing wrong. And I just want to keep him in the car, and me out from under a car.\n\nFinally, a unit shows up. Red and blues, my favorite colors. We grab the guy and throw him in cuffs. They ask for a written statement, and I oblige.\n\nAdrenaline starts to recede. Nerves. Quiet back down. Digestion. Starts again. I want a smoke!\n\nThe last time I saw a wrong way driver was on an elevated stretch of freeway many years ago.  I was fresh out of high school working as a driver for a statewide pharmacy. It was 4 am, I was 9 hours and 55 minutes in to a 10 hour shift. The guy was in my lane, coming at me. I swerved, and our rear view mirrors missed literally by inches. I can still remember watching the driver pass me in slow motion. 2 feet from my window. At a combined speed of 140mph. I look in my rear view, and the tow truck behind me couldn't swerve. Bang. Dead on into each other. I stopped my truck and ran backward to the vehicles that were now on fire. I opened the passenger's door as a Semi driver put the fire out. The driver had the steering wheel in his chest. I mean that as literally as you can imagine it. The passenger was covered in blood. I pulled him out and laid him on the ground. I covered him with my denim jacket (so long ago that they were still cool!). The driver died. The passenger had stitched from his hair line, down, over his eye, to his chin. I saw him in the hospital the next day. The driver's funeral was a few days later. I will never forget those images. And I did not want to repeat that again tonight.\n\nI stayed on a call a bit late tonight. I chatted at the gas pumps 2 minutes longer than I needed to. I made a wrong turn heading in to the station. I checked my email before leaving work. I didn't change out. I brought my vest, my belt, and my flashlight home. And all of that led up to me being exactly where I needed to be, when I needed to be there, with the equipment I needed. Timing, fate, or coincidence? I don't know. Did I save a life tonight? A family? Who knows. That's the thing. It's always hard to guess if you've prevented a crime or a tragedy from happening. Maybe they would have swerved on their own. Maybe not. But, besides the shakes, and the feeling that I was going to pee myself, I feel good. I feel good about being able to be where I was needed, when I was needed. Even if I wasn't on the clock at the time. Everyone made it home safely. Including me. And that's a damn good day in my book.\n\n",

        "text": "Ryan has been described by /u/El_Mono_Rojo in these two stories:  \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/23vnwi/crazy_town/ and http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/24d4mw/scavenger_hunt/\n\nEMR did a good job of beginning to explore the depths of Ryan’s unique personality and at times ludicrous behavior. Ryan and I went to the academy together and have worked together on and off for many years. He is a massive man but has quickness like an alligator. His favorite past times include farting in my locker and playing with sock puppets. EMR will delve into some of that more in another story. He is also a great cop and very creative. He is very light hearted and like EMR he takes great pleasure in pushing my buttons.\n\nRyan and I had been out of the academy for about a year when we got a call for a middle aged man making out with a four year old girl in a secluded area of a shopping center. We had been parked in a lot not far from the scene so we got there pretty quickly. I wanted to walk right up to the suspect and handle business. Ryan, on the other hand, decided we should take a more tactical approach. \n\n“What if we go up in the adjoining office building, watch for a bit, get an idea about the situation and then confront the situation?”\n\nAs I said, Ryan is a massive guy but he is smart and very good at sneaking up on people. At times this is scary because he has used that ability to scare the shit out of me. No 300 pound man should be able to hide in the places he finds. \n\nWe went up into the office building and got an aerial view of the scene. Sure enough a middle-aged man was making out with a young girl. We couldn’t believe our eyes.\n\n“Maybe that’s a midget?” I remarked, hoping that my eyes were lying. \n\nWe saw enough so Ryan, doing his best Beverly Hills Ninja impression and I approached the couple. \n\nThe man, a foreigner, spoke broken English and appeared pissed off that we were interrupting his make out session. \n\n“Why are you interrupting my time with my wife?”\n\nWe were stunned. We were young and new, we had not seen something this horrible yet. \n\n“She is my new bride and is promised to me.”\n\n“So you admit you were making out with her? Where are her parents? Do they know about this?” I asked.\n\n“Yes, they set up the marriage and I am allowed to be with her.”  \n\nRyan and I were besides ourselves and exhibiting a great deal of self-control. \n\nWe dug into the case a bit more and met the girl’s very pleasant parents. They were mad at us for detaining their future son in law. \n\nWe knew we had to take this guy to jail. We also were fresh out of the academy so we knew the code sections like the back of our hands. We couldn’t find an appropriate charge. Our sergeant came to the scene with the big codebook and spent time looking too. We called senior detectives and prosecutors. No one had an answer. \n\n\nThat’s when Ryan had a light bulb moment. \n\n“Excuse me sir, have you been drinking today?” I knew where Ryan was going with this and, yes, he called him sir. Ryan is exceedingly polite. \n\n“I have had some vodka.” \n\n“It appears to me that you are intoxicated in a public place.”\n \nBrilliant. Ryan locked him up for public intoxication, which would give the lawyers time to figure out a charge. \n\nThe man was released from jail a few hours later. A few days later the lawyers and detectives figured out a charge. It was a catch all charge for being a shit head to kids. \n\nRyan and I were given the honor of serving the warrant. At this point I should point out again Ryan’s size. He played Division I football on the D Line. \n\nRyan and I approached the house and noticed a fed ex package on the porch. I saw a glint in Ryan’s eyes and a smile begin to spread across his face. \n\n“Just go with this.” Ryan picked up the package and approached the door.\n\nHe held the package up to the peephole and knocked on the door.\n\n“Fedex” He could hardly say it because his smile was so large. I couldn’t believe this was about to happen.\n\nThe man opened the door. He had a smile too because he thought he was about to get a special delivery. The smile quickly turned to fear when he saw the giant at his door, the fucking insane giant with a huge grin beginning to take his d line stance.\n\nThe man turned and began to run towards the back door. Only one of us could fit through the door frame at a time and I did not want to get in the way of Ryan. He flung himself like Lawrence Taylor on the heels of Joe Theisman. This man didn’t stand a chance. It was over before it started. \n\n\nThe man was convicted of a misdemeanor and CPS got involved with the family. The law in our state was changed to help cover these situations. \n\nPlease do not try to guess the culture or background of the suspect. It does not matter. Shit bags will use anything to explain their bad behavior. \n",

        "text": "My 40th post here at TFTSQ! I thought I had a dozen or so, tops, but they keep coming to me. Thanks again to everyone for all the kind words and encouragement to keep writing. I'm still noodling over the possibility of a book but need to do some recon with some department entities to check on the restrictions in doing so. - EMR\n\n_____________________________\n\nOne of the downsides to working for “The Man” is the expectation you’ll be stuck working Holidays, weekends, overnights, etc. Crime never rests! So why should we? \n\nThanksgivings were particularly tough for my family. My dad, a retired cop, had to work one Thanksgiving when I was in high school and to change things up from our usual family tradition of putting aside some of the breast meat and letting him heat it up when he gets home after midnight, we decided it might be cool to go out to a restaurant. We dragged the whole extended family, about twelve of us, to one of the few places open, a diner in my dad’s patrol area, and were seated promptly. We perused the menu while awaiting my dad’s arrival (he informed us he may be tied up on a domestic – the most common and annoying of holiday crimes) and most of us decided on the turkey special. \n\nMy mom grew slightly impatient and, not wanting to make everyone wait, ordered my dad the special as well. She made sure to tell the waiter he was still coming, but held up. The wait staff knew my mom and dad by face – they frequented the diner while he was off duty – and most also knew his line of work. When my dad arrived eventually, the waiter promptly brought over his plate which had been staging under the heat lamp for him. \n\nAs soon as he lifted his fork and knife, the manager came scuttling over and leaned down close to my dad. \n\n“Excuse me sir. Pardon the interruption but could you, maybe… assist?.. with an unruly customer?” He nodded back over his shoulder and those of us in hearing range glanced down the aisle to see what the problem was. It was obvious who the problem child was almost immediately: a clearly drunk, middle-aged man was teetering on the edge of his bar stool, swaying with an imaginary breeze and glaring at passing waitresses. \n\nMy dad sighed as he placed his utensils down. “You just want him out of here? Or for him to go to jail?” \n\n“Oh, just removed. He doesn’t even need to pay, just get him out.” The manager responded quickly. \n\nMy dad looked over at us and shook his head in resignation. “Ok, no problem. I’ll be right back.” He told us as he stood and straightened his uniform. \n\nHe walked over to the man and out of earshot but I watched the interaction with rapt interest. It started off rather calm, he spoke to the man and had a smile on his face. The man contemplated my dad for a moment, mouth hanging open and eyes darting around at the attention he was suddenly receiving from the few customers in his vicinity. Then it took a turn for the worse. I heard him bark something, in-articulable to me but clearly rude judging by my dad’s quick change in body language. My dad made the face I so often saw when I screwed up big time at home and for a moment I felt compassion for the drunkard. That dissolved quickly however when the man stood up and got in my dad’s face. \n\nMy dad once again, this time louder, told the man to leave and I could see the subsequent reaction on the drunken patron’s part coming from a mile away: he pulled back a clenched fist and wound up like Roger Clemens. His pitch never made home base, however, as my dad intercepted it and rolled the man onto the ground. He struggled for a moment and several people at my table as well as others let out cries of amazed shock. A moment later and it was over. My dad stood up, straightened his uniform again and looked to us across the restaurant, shaking his head incredulously. He gave a little wave as he dragged the now limp offender out the front door and out to his patrol car.\n\nWe all settled down and murmured to ourselves about the scene we had just taken in. My dad’s full plate sat in front of an empty chair for the remainder of our meal. We weren’t quick enough to tell the waiter to box up his food and when we asked if he had done so on his own, he apologized for having discarded it. To add insult to injury, the bill came and they charged us full price for his meal. My mom was dumbfounded: They had let the drunk guy go, no charge for the meal and several drinks he had consumed, but felt it necessary to charge us for the uneaten and discarded meal for my dad. (I’m not saying we expected to be comped, just that the dichotomy was astounding.)\n\nI don’t think my parents returned to that diner until a change in management occurred. \n\nFast forward several years and I found myself working patrol on a gloomy Thanksgiving Day. I had just cleared a shoplifting call from some Asian grocery store and made my way to the nearest source of caffeine – the local 7-11. Almost every other shop was closed in the area and the 7-11 was a beacon of alcoholic hope for the lonely derelicts that lived in the low-income apartments nearby. On entering, I noticed they were making a killing on beer and cheap wine sales. The line stretched beyond the Big Bite counter and around to the milk cooler. \n\nI was greeted by the female cashier. “Hello, my king. Happy giving thanks day!” I have no idea why she called me her king and, quite frankly, it kind of creeped me out. Maybe it was a layover from her home country in Africa from whence she had recently immigrated. \n\n“Hey Abena. Busy day, huh?” I replied to her smiling face. She was ignoring an impatient man who was clutching a Coors light six pack to greet me. \n\n“Oh, yes my king. Very busy. Many people need beer today.” She smiled and nodded to me and I nodded back, not knowing where else to take the conversation. \n\n“Oh, my king? The bathroom is broken. So sorry, so very sorry my king.” She bowed her head in resignation at the bad news, worried I might make a royal decree to call in a guillotine for her lack of plumbing ability.\n\n“Oh, no problem, thanks.” I left her to her customers and made my way to the coffee island. Now, this is where I made my second mistake, hindsight being twenty-twenty and all. As I perused my options, I noticed the then newly released specialty brew offered by 7-11: “Fusion Energy” blend super-caffeinated coffee. I was never one to turn down a challenge and I filled the largest cup there with the dark liquid. \n\nNow, backing up, my first mistake was the large, three cheese and sausage omelet with extra bacon and three cups of coffee I had consumed with some squad mates after roll call. As you might predict, the two fateful choices would later come back to ruin my day, but at the time I wasn’t doing the mental threat assessment. \n\nI queued up behind a guy buying three bottles of Wild Irish Rose and waited dutifully for my turn at the register. Abena greeted me warmly again as I arrived in front of her.\n\n“Oh, my king. It is so nice to see you here on this giving thanks day. Please, no pay, no pay.” She waved me on, confused by my attempt to soil my royal money by putting it in her till. \n\n“You sure? It’s just a coffee; I think I can swing it.” I never expected the favor but tried to show gratification when I got it. \n\nShe insisted. “For you my king, please, no pay.” She bowed her head and I glanced around at the others in line behind me. An elderly Hispanic man managing to hold four Olde English 40oz bottles shrugged his shoulders at me, acknowledging the awkward silence caused by Abena’s gesture.\n\n“Well, thanks again Abena.” I shoved a couple dollars in the Ronald McDonald House charity jar and quickly exited before I could accidently insult Abena further. \n\nI went to one of my hang-outs, a parking garage overlooking a usually bustling shopping center. The odd silence was fine by me as I read over a free newspaper I had picked up to pass the time and sipped my strong brew. It took a few moments for the rumbling to begin. It was easy to ignore at first, nothing to worry about. \n\n“3Bravo60. Hold me out with a wreck, South-bound Oak Street at Elm. Roll Fire my way too, there’re going to be injuries.” Nick broke the silence on the radio. I contemplated his traffic for a moment though.\n\n“If he’s starting fire for a wreck on Oak, I wonder if I can get by if these rumbles turn into something more?” I mentally pondered. I decided not to tempt fate and pulled out of my parking spot, headed for his wreck to see if I could help or at least get past it to the station for a possible 10-200 (cop 10-code for going number 2). Oak was the only major road that connected my area to the station. If I had to take an alternate route, it would tack on a couple minutes that could mean the difference between success and disaster in the pants department. \n\nI soon pulled up on Nick’s accident. He had clearly, vastly underplayed the severity of it on the radio. Scattered pieces of wreckage littered both lanes of the road and two still-smoldering, twisted mini vans were joined in a violent metallic embrace directly on the double yellow line. \n\n“Dude, crazy, right?!” Nick said as I exited my car. \n\n“Yeah man… you need help?” I offered even though the rumbles had started once more. \n\n“Shyeah! You mind setting up a flare pattern and turning around traffic for me?” \n\n“Ok.” I was hesitant but knew it was the right thing to do. The rubles returned, mocking me as I bent over and lit a full box worth of flares. I donned my traffic vest and walked to the turn-around I had crafted and began waving along the few cars that were out and about, the drivers slowing to stare at the spectacle Nick was attempting to work. \n\nOne particularly nosey driver stopped when it was his turn at the front of the line. “Everyone ok?” He asked, indicating the occupants of the two cars who were now being tended to by rescue. \n\n“Yeah, they’ll be fine.” I told him before waving him on more persistently. I was no longer worried for their safety. The deep cramps and copious guttural noises from my stomach gave me something new to worry about. I knew then I’d need to get out of there. I looked around for Nick but caught him just as he entered the back of one of the ambulances. Crap.\n\nA few minutes passed and a thin sweat formed on my brow and lip. If the wreckers didn’t show up soon I knew I‘d have to make the trek back from the direction I came to use an alternative route to the sanctuary of the station. Finally, a friendly face pulled up.\n\n“Damn! Nick really underplayed this one, huh?” Ned called from his cruiser. \n\n“Yeah… hey Ned – would you mind taking over for me for a few? I’ll be just a minute.”\n\n“Oh, sorry, I’m heading in to the station to start the turkey fryer.” He began cranking his wheel to turn around but I stopped him.\n\n“No… Ned… seriously. I need your help.” I clenched my lower muscular system as another round of cramps hit me. \n\nNed looked at me in concern for a moment. “Well, I really need to get the thing set up and – “\n\n“I’m about to crap my pants!” I finally put it out there in black and white for him. \n\nHe reacted by quickly dropping his cruiser in park, flipping on his rear lights and jumping out of the car to take my spot. “Go on, brother.' He pat me on the shoulder, \"Go do what you gotta do.” He then began waving traffic for me as I waddled back to my cruiser.\n\nI began pulling away as Ned exited the ambulance, throwing his arms up in confusion as I tore out of his accident scene. I was on a mission and could explain later.\n\nNed stopped traffic for me as I sped down the road. Sitting in the cruiser had put me in a position not as functional for stopping a bowel torrent as I had had while standing in the roadway and the cramps and groans from my stomach seemed to know they now had the upper hand. I smashed both of my feet down into the floor board in an effort to use any obscure muscle I had left to stop the inevitable. I knew then I was facing defeat and would not make it back to the station. \n\nI scanned the roadway for anything that might offer solace. A few homes and housing developments branched off the road, but I wasn’t about to go knock on a strangers door asking permission to destroy their commode. Then I saw it, illuminated by the heavens via a rare break in the otherwise overcast sky: a church. Oh, but not just any church, it was St. Luke’s, a place famous for its hospitality towards the community. Surely they’d have an open door, would be supporting the local homeless on this holiday, and would be offering sanctuary to tormented souls like me in our time of need.\n\nI pulled in to the lot and realized there were few cars parked there. No matter, I figured as I exited my car without bending at the waist, the clergy lives on site and two thirds of their parishioners live in walking distance.\n\nI waddled to the first door – locked! I kept going, door after door, and was quickly realizing how dire my circumstances were: every door was locked. I was in deep, I realized, and couldn’t even get back to my car. My stomach churned, telling me the demon within was ready to be born into this bleak world at my expense. I looked around frantically for at least some form of cover when I saw the only option - a low brick wall constructed to beautify the church’s trash cans and recycling bins. \n\nI made my within, and made sure no one was around before frantically dropping my gun belt then pants. An up-turned lid with some left over rain from the night before was the obvious target for my shame and as soon as I turned around, the foul liquid exploded from me, splashing trash can water and other unmentionables. I didn’t care though; such was the effect of the sweet release. \n\nI finished quickly due to the amount of time I had had to prime the pump, so to say, and I came to another awful realization: I had nothing to wipe with. A search for anything within arm’s reach turned up no viable candidate so I did the only thing I could. I manned up, pulled up my pants gingerly, and, after dumping the make-shift shitter into a half full trash can, waddled over to collect my gun belt. I made my way to the cruiser, this time in less discomfort than when I had started and checked the glove box. Of all the days I could have used a 7-11 napkin, this was tops. But to my astonishment, I had none. It was akin to a doctor’s waiting room without the ubiquitous year old periodicals – usually overlooked but truly missed when they’re missing in a time of need.\n\nMy astonishment was interrupted by a friendly knock on my window. A man dressed in a priest’s collar smiled at me as I rolled down the window. He didn’t seem to notice the uncomfortable yoga position I was in to prevent my rear from touching the seat. \n\n“Everything ok officer? I’m just coming in to open up the church for our Thanksgiving feast.” He smiled but glanced at his holy house with a little concern. \n\n“No, no. Everything’s fine father. I was just… checking doors.” The half lie felt dirty but I felt I had done my due diligence in disposing of my “refuse.”\n\n“Oh, God bless you officer. Thank you very much. Enjoy your holiday.” He turned and walked to the nearest door to go about his Godly duties. \n\nI eventually made it back to the station and cleaned up. I was forced to go the rest of the day commando, but I felt it was a small price to pay. I lived with the weight on my shoulders of my ill deed for a few days before I felt I had to confide in someone. I picked the wrong guy, though. To this day, Brandon still laughs uncontrollably whenever this story comes up. \n\nTo punctuate the story even more, a few weeks after the incident, Sarge read an “Extra-Patrol” request from St. Luke’s. It seemed, the request read, one of their homeless clients had been defecating in the dumpster area during the overnight hours and the clergy there was asking our assistance in keeping tabs on the building just in case we could catch one in the act. Brandon raised his hand and the Sarge called on him to my chagrin. \n\n“EMR can take that assignment. He’s familiar with the grounds there.” \n",

        "text": "Another story of excitement from one of my conferences.  In fact, the very same conference that [this story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/28r85f/ride_along_quiet_drinks_in_a_hotel_bar/) came from, only two days later.\n\nThursday is always the free day of our conferences, giving the attendees a chance to wander around and see the sights of whatever city we were in.  Since I'm a raving nerd, I had taken the opportunity to rent a car, grab three fellow nerds, and drive down to Cape Canaveral for a full day of utter geek-gasming over the manned space program AND a wildlife refuge.  It was like the Discovery Channel and NatGeo rolled into one.  One of the best days of my adult life.  [Here, bonus pic of me with the Space Shuttle in the background.](http://i.imgur.com/lEiYzto.jpg)  We even got a guy busted for DUII on the way back.  Brain-fried, excited, but tired, we returned to the hotel and went our ways back to our respective rooms.  I grabbed a bottle of the only micro brew we could find in the city (seriously, 12 different stores before we could find Sam Adams), and headed for bed.\n\nNow, I should point out that we do a lot of room swapping/sharing at these conferences.  Many of the attendees are college students, so money is a big deal.  Four to a room is pretty much standard, so when one chapter is only bringing one person and another chapter is bringing 7, we'll pair them up to save costs.  This was the case with me, I was the only person from my chapter to attend this conference, and had been paired with a chapter out of a community college in the LA area.  I knew several of the members already from previous events, so I felt comfortable.  I walked into my room, said hey to the two guys who were trying to find something unsmelly to wear in order to go out on the town, and crashed on my ~~bed~~ couch with a thin blanket over me.  I opened my beer and proceeded to put my thoughts of the day into coherent order while bragging to my roommates about what I'd seen and done.  About this time, Roommate #4 entered the room.\n\nNow, while I had been away, Roommate #4 had had an interesting day of his own.  He was only 21, and at this point in his life believed that drinking didn't mean \"having a few cold ones with friends while you socialize,\" it meant \"getting as drunk as possible as quickly as possible on cheap booze and trying to score with whatever happened to be around and willing.\"  Several hours earlier he had gone up to the rooftop pool with a 14\" knife that more resembled a Roman Gladius than it did any sort of usable edged tool, and tried to impress the girls there by using it to knock the tops off beer bottles and allowing them to fall over the side of the roof, to shatter spectacularly 14 floors below.  Needless to say, hotel security was informed, who in turn informed the conference director, who in turn informed several of the present law enforcement officers.  They went upstairs, disarmed Roommate #4, and told him to wait in his chapter advisor's room for the chapter advisor to get back.  Roommate #4 was apparently willing to do this for a while, but got bored/angry/tired of waiting/simply forgot, and came back to our room.  He was very angry, still quite drunk, and trying like crazy to tell his inebriated side of the story to us in order to gain sympathy/character witnesses for the coming interrogation.  I did my best to ignore him, intent on organizing the photos in my camera, while surreptitiously getting 911 dialed into my phone and my mag light out from my bag and hidden under the blanket.\n\nDid I forget to mention that Roommate #4 was an amateur boxer with a known temper?  I did, didn't I?  Yeah, that's kind of an important detail.  It's why I had the mag light out, there was no way I could deal with this guy hand-to-hand if he decided to get violent.\n\nAfter an ill-remembered amount of time, in walks the chapter advisor, cool as a cucumber in a Health-Department-Approved refrigerator.  We'll call him Craig.  Craig was a veteran of the LAPD, some 30 years on the job before retiring and going to work as an instructor at the aforementioned community college.  He'd been through the Watts riots, he'd been through the Rodney King riots, he'd shot and been shot at several times.  He'd dealt with everything from biker gangs to white supremacists to gangs of all kinds to white-collar criminals.  So Roommate #4 was nothing new to him.  It was almost beautiful to watch as Craig used his 5th-degree Black Belt in Verbal Judo to talk Roommate #4 down from a rage so great he was punching defenseless furniture and making some pretty terrible threats, to a quivering, crying, blubbering mess that, while still a good 6\" taller than Craig and at least 50 pounds heavier, looked like Quinton Aaron from The Blind Side when he was getting scolded.  Craig told Roommate #4 to come with him, they needed to talk privately.  As the door to the room opened I spotted Byron (from the previous story) and another officer in the hall, batman belts on, faces impassive and serious.  Roommate #4 meekly went with them, as Craig came back in, packed Roommate #4's stuff, and followed them out.\n\nRoommate #4 was not seen again at the conference, he was immediately booted from the event and the hotel, and told he would need to find his own way home (that chapter had elected to drive out, a feat I found rather impressive) as he was no longer a part of that chapter and therefore could not ride in the vans they had rented.  How he got the money for a plane or train ticket back, I do not know, but he was apparently there when the chapter got back.\n\nHowever, this isn't exactly the end of the story.  About a month later I got a call from the dean's office of that college.  They needed me to come down and testify at the explusion hearing for Roommate #4, would I be willing to do so if they flew me down and put me up in a hotel?  Despite the fact that Roommate #4 was my frat brother, he had made the association look bad, put people in harms way, and damaged private property.  Yes, I would come down and do so.  So the next week, there I was, in LA on an impromptu vacation, hanging out with that chapter and another chapter from a nearby school.  My testimony was just a way to confirm what Craig and Roommates #2 and #3 had said.  Roommate #4 was expelled from the college, required to pay back a scholarship that he'd used for some of his classes, barred from campus, and fined a fairly substantial sum of money.  As far as I know, he's never been seen again.\n\nTL;DR - Alcohol and stupidity are bad, m'kay?",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/28uqix/officer_the_voyeur/",
        "text": "This one is a good example of our relationship with the city police. They have a much greater pool of resources than we do and can get more done than we can. We don’t have a fancy crime lab or cyber division or even a detention center, so we have to rely on them a lot.\n\nWe had just received a report of a woman finding a camera in a bathroom on campus that was pointed directly at a place where women undress. Awareness bulletins were posted and several days later, several more reports of cameras in bathrooms popped up everywhere on campus, sometimes in dormitory rooms.  We took them for analysis and discovered one of them was unique enough (won’t go in to much detail) that it led the investigation back to a student.\n\nThe city police had gotten involved at some point (kid lived off campus), and I was put in charge of obtaining an arrest warrant for the guy. It was a misdemeanor voyeurism violation, but the District Attorney we presented the case to said we could possibly upgrade to a felony depending on the content of the video or pictures.  The city police were nice enough to assign us some guys from Vice to help since they did warrants all the time and this would be my first warrant case.\n\nAfter getting the warrant swore out, we decided to skip the route of notifying the Warrant Squad since it was a minor case. Our director, along with a city police commander, gave us permission to operate jointly and we decided to make the visit in plainclothes with some uniformed backup from the city. I was excited, as this was big for our department to obtain and serve our own warrants, and it was unfamiliar territory.  I like action so, this would be a great change to the usual monotonous crap.\n\nWe did a bit of digging through Social Media and developed a small pool of people we used to track him down and developed a bit of a profile on him. Mr. Voyeur was known to drink, was a bit of a recluse and computer nerd, worked for the University (the position gave him access to dorms and rooms on campus), and abused prescription medication in the form of grinding pills of amphetamine salts and other anti-anxiety medication and snorting them (we call it booger shooters but I’m sure there’s other names for it out there).\n\nPrescription medication abuse is a much more prevailing factor in college drug use than ever before, and some say it’s more abused now than marijuana by a huge factor. With over 50% of the student population on some type of depression/anti-anxiety/anti-psychotic medication, it’s slung around more than dirty laundry, and is almost impossible to track the trends of abuse. We have dealt with tweakers, dealers, pushers, buyers (recreational and heavy abusers), and everything you can imagine under the sun with prescription drug use and its various forms of ingestion. One thing I learned: people who don’t simply pop the pill and swallow tend to be more violent.\n\nSure enough, our guy had a history of violence including a pending APO that was influenced by Drugs or Alcohol.\n\nLovely.\n\nWe ended up getting a tip a few days later that he was at the apartment. It was late, and so we managed to get a few Vice and city guys to meet with us and we rode over there. I felt like an undercover DEA agent with my simple jeans, t-shirt, and tactical vest I had to front the money for since we didn't really have a plainclothes unit. It was pretty badass.\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n“You think he’s in there?” Josh whispered to me. He was on the hinge side of the door frame we were standing at. I was on the opening side with one foot forward to stop the door from closing if it suddenly opened. I listened at the door, hearing nothing indicating there was any life inside of the room. \n\nI looked down the hall to the two plainclothes city police officers standing at the door to an adjoining room to the suite we were standing in front of. The rooms shared a common bathroom that connected the two rooms together. The building was small with narrow hallways, maybe five to six rooms per floor. I was unfamiliar with the building because it was off campus, but was a favorite option for students since the rent was much cheaper than student housing  and the building had been converted by the owner to accommodate the student clientele he advertised to: cheap, affordable housing and away from the University’s eye.\n\nThe bigger one, Nate, looked like a Viking with his huge ratty beard, cargo shorts, black t-shirt under his load-bearing vest, with one hand on the Glock tucked tightly against his chest. The female with him, Steph, was an attractive blonde fresh out of prostitution and was transferred to the Vice unit we were with. She was standing with her back to the outer wall with her own gun drawn but at her side, waiting for the action to begin with a nervous look in her eye.\n\nNate caught my eye and shook his head, indicating there was no movement in the adjoining apartment. Josh took a deep breath and banged on the door again “Police! Open the door!” Again, no response. \n\nJosh took a few breaths and clicked the PTT on his wrist-mic “Anything?”  A raspy voice on the mutual aid channel reported nothing in the lobby. Josh shook his head again. A keyholder had been requested by the city police to respond to the location when we first got the tip; however, he did not live in the building and was coming from a different part of the city. The two city police officers started to put away their weapons and slowly came towards us. We were going to call it and try again the next day.\n\nAt the end of the hall, a door opened and a female poked her head out. All of us turned towards her and she quickly darted back in to the apartment. The sound of the deadbolt being thrown sounded throughout the hallway. \n\nAs Josh went to turn back to me, a stream of red liquid shot out from the door we were standing beside, splattering across his face. I had no time to react from the momentary distraction caused by the female, and the door slammed just as I went to slide my foot in the door frame. I was greeted with sounds of heavy objects being thrown around inside the room causing a great commotion from behind the door. Josh instantly fell backwards and grabbed at his face “The mother fucker sprayed me! Kik! The mother fucker sprayed me!” \n\nThe blow-back from the pepper spray the guy just discharged in to the hallway immediately hit me like a cloud of angry bees. Wiping snot and tears from my face, I attempted to radio to ground units to get up there ASAP when I heard a *whump BANG!*  *whump Bang!* Splinters shot from the center of the door and a small metallic spike poked through the fresh holes in the door and retracted. Over and over, the object smashed the middle of the door sending showers of wood in to the hallway like rain. The sound was deafening and it threw all four of us in to chaos. \n\nThe earpiece in my ear screamed “Specter833! Specter833! Subject has a weapon! Officers need assistance!” Nate was at the end of the hall on one knee, radio in hand screaming in to it, gun in the other, with Steph angling to shoot at the door. \n\nThe series of bangs had stopped, leaving a cluster of holes in the door and it was quiet again. I caught one look at Josh, opened mouthed and breathing like a carp right next to that door. I’m usually pretty calm, but at that moment, a switch instantly flipped in my head. I was angry. Angry at this like shit bag who just scared the ever living fuck out of me and my comrades over something as stupid as a misdemeanor warrant. Not only that, but he hurt my friend. My comrade. My brother. \n\nTrue, he wasn’t dead or dying and hadn’t been shot. But his pain for that moment was my pain. Quite literally, as my face was contorted in to a hard mess of streaming tears and snot from the discharge and I was visibly shaking like a psychopath strung out on methamphetamine.  \n\nIn less than a heartbeat I had my own weapon and flashlight in my hand, took one sidestep across the plane of the door, and picked my strong foot off the ground. With every ounce of muscle in my body, I slammed the heel of my foot in to the door just below the door handle.\n\nNow I’m not sure if any of you have ever kicked in a door but let me tell you: that shit isn't like it is in the movies. I had on a crappy pair of dark gray New Balance cross trainers I used for biking and about 170 pounds on me.  We learned in the academy the best way to do it is to stand with your back to the door and kick backwards with your strong foot. We always did it with two man teams so that the lead “kicker” or breach officer could step back and get back in to position while someone else took lead and point entry. \n\nWhatever the guy had that he was using to smash holes in the door, I didn't want that to end up in the back of my skull. So I opted for the movie star role of doing it the hard way. The door flung open with such force that the knob and cylinder broke out of the door and flung backwards towards me, barely missing my crotch area. The frame of the door miraculously held, so I didn't have to combat wood as I entered at the ready position. The door flung in to a short dresser Mr. Voyeur tried to place in the doorway to keep us from opening the door and it had toppled over, on top of Mr. Voyeur.\n\n I stepped on top of the dresser and stood over my prize like a triumphant champion of Justice and said “Mr. Voyeur? I’m Officer Kikujirimori with the University Police Department. I have a warrant for your arrest.”\n\n Later, I would learn that I didn't so much say as much as I gagged the words due to the effects of the pepper spray. In my SNS induced state of euphoria, I did not notice that my face was swelling slightly from the pepper spray and my boiling blood pressure. I also found out the next morning that I had broken one of the small bones in my foot from kicking in the door, as I had looked down at my sore foot and noticed it had turned an interesting shade of purple when I woke up. We recovered the weapon he used to beat the door up: a Halligan bar about two feet long that he stole from a city fire department station (serials matched the query, of course the city declined to press charges).\n\nWe ended up arresting him for one count of Felony APO, Possession of a Dangerous Weapon in Commission of a Crime, and the Voyeurism Warrant. His computer turned up no actual evidence of any photographs or video from the cameras, but had the software he used to obtain the video whenever he decided to go back and recover the cameras. We used the software to recover the video and images from the devices, which turned up several women primping in mirrors but not actually in a state of undress. \n\nHe ended up pleading out to Privacy Violation charges under the Voyeurism statute and one count of misdemeanor APO since none of us were severely injured. Standard slap on the wrist sentencing later and he was back at school to face disciplinary hearings from our Student Judiciary Committee where I served as the star witness for the school. They require less proof or evidence than a regular court, therefore after less than an hour of interviews they expelled and barred him from the school for life. He was stripped of his degree status and all credits towards the program he was in.\n\nSome of us say that even when you lock them up and the charges get dropped or the case gets thrown out, it can still be worth it, as the school can royally fuck them over worse than any court can. Likely, he will never get in to another institution for higher education with his record. Sometimes, a win can come out of a loss, even if the guys in the department make fun of you for breaking your foot trying to play superhero.\n",

        "text": "Frank\n\nFrank was a mess. Every time I saw him in a public area (walking through a busy downtown area for example), people would be staring. He’d be ambling down the street, angrily talking to himself with clenched fisted determination, and the sea of fellow pedestrians would part for him. He was a huge man, Six foot four at least, three hundred plus pounds of mostly muscle (save the beer paunch) and cast an intimidating shadow on anyone unlucky enough to not get out his way when he had a mission. \n\nUsually, Frank’s mission was to roam the neighborhoods of older, single-family homes where the large portion of our elderly community resided. Mostly comprised of original purchasers when the homes were built in the sixties, the elderly people became easy prey for Frank’s routine of coercion and intimidation and would usually fold quickly to his demands for payment on “work rendered.” He rarely actually did any work of course; it was more closely related to a mafia shakedown. Frank would pound on the door of some long widowed old lady and when she answered he’d inform her that her trees needed trimming, or her gutters cleaning. He’d tell her he’d take care of it, no problem, and wouldn’t take no for an answer. When the unsuspecting homeowner would leave Frank unattended, he’d usually find his way either to a shady spot to rest or, in some cases, into a garage or kitchen to pilfer beer or foodstuffs. Then, having waited his predetermined time, he’d pound on the door once again, saying he was done with the task and it was time to pay up. He’d put out his enormous mitt and if it wasn’t quickly filled with currency, he’d become enraged. Needless to say, Frank was a pain in the collective butt of the community. For every victim that had the chutzpah to call the police on Frank, there were probably ten that figured it was just easier to give him a twenty and get back to Jeopardy re-runs.  \n\nIt was one of those civil complaints I was responding to one spring afternoon, when I had my last run-in with Frank. You get a sort of sixth sense for calls when you have worked an area or population long enough, but it didn’t take some superhuman intuition to hear the dispatch and realize who my suspect was. \n\n“Caller advises a tall, black, male wearing dirty clothing will not leave her door. Caller stated he is demanding money for cleaning her yard but advises she never requested assistance. Suspect is further described as having a large scar on his forehead, 1225 hours.”\n\nIt was more like a golf divot than a “scar” and the rumor floating around when I was a rookie is it was left over from Frank’s drunken encounter with a pickup truck while jaywalking across a major four lane roadway. His forehead Grand Canyon didn’t seem to bother Frank though. I guess he figured “why fix it?”\n\nAs I scanned the neighborhood for Frank, my cell phone rang. It was a call from one of the station detectives, Jason. \n\n“Hey dude, just making sure you know that’s Frank you just got sent to.” Jason had a long, adversarial history with Frank. The story goes, Jason was sent along with a second unit to Frank’s mom’s apartment to work a domestic. Frank had been drinking and apparently his mom said something he didn’t agree with so he slapped her. She was cowering in the apartment building entrance when Jason and his backup got there and had the bruises to back her claim. The two cops had their marching orders and bravely entered the dragon’s den. They encountered the beast almost immediately. \n\n“Ok, Frank. You know the drill: you hit your mom, you gotta go to jail.” Even back then, Frank was a repeat customer. Jason used the direct approach with him, hoping to avoid another fracas with the Frankenstein-like brute. \n\n“Nu-uh, no way Jason. You ain’t takin’ me nowhere. We gunna have to fight it out.” Frank was tense with aggression, ready to start throwing ham-sized fists at badges. \n\nJason, not much over five feet tall but built like a fireplug, nodded to his partner – the sign to go hands on. I guess he figured his years of high school and collegiate wrestling might give him an advantage over the giant. \n\nJason’s backup tells the next part best: they went to grab Frank’s arms, one to each side, but Frank saw that move coming a mile away. He grabbed Jason and lifted him off the ground, military pressing him over his head. The backup unit, surprised by Frank’s brute ferocity, could only stand back and watch as Jason was hurled across the room and into a closet through its two slatted, wooden doors. The backup guy was torn between rendering aid for his partner and saving his own skin as the hulking Frank wheeled on him. He called an officer in trouble on the radio and drew his baton, which did nothing to calm the enraged Frank. He rained down blows on Frank’s calves and shoulders as they parried across the room but they had no effect. \n\nJust before Frank, having closed the distance on the backup guy, let loose a potential haymaker in the direction of the cop, both men stopped fighting due to a strange noise emanating from the shattered remains of the closet. Like[Gimli fighting a cave troll]( http://i.imgur.com/pu6phgY.gif) in Lord of the Rings, Jason rose from his shadowy resting place, cursing a stream of obscenity and brushing splinters of door off his uniform. He made eye contact with Frank and lowered his head, bull-like, before charging across the room full speed. The backup unit, again, could only stand back and watch and Jason clung to Frank’s torso with one hand, the other raining blow after blow down on him with a continual punctuation of curse words. \n\nWhen he couldn’t shake Jason free, Frank realized the gravity of the situation and got to his knees, arms raised in surrender. The backup unit had to hold Jason back while another swarm of cops came in and placed Frank in cuffs. \n\nEver since that incident, Frank and Jason had regarded each other similar to how two alpha male wolves from different packs do – fearful respect but aware they could come to blows at any moment. Jason wanted to know if this would be the day.\n\n“Dude, if you need anything, I’m just down the street. I’ll be there in two seconds, just say the word.” Jason reassured me over the phone.\n\n“Thanks man, but I’ll be ok.” I had dealt with Frank on several occasions and knew how to keep in his good graces. “I’m  not going to lock him up for knocking on some old lady’s door, just shoo him along across the line.” Frank had recently moved to another jurisdiction that happened to be within walking distance to our current location. My plan, having been successful in the past, was to urge him to find new turf closer to his home. \n\n“Good call. I’ll be listening though.” Jason bid me goodbye just as I spotted Frank ambling up the road. He was oblivious to my presence as I pulled up and rolled down my window.\n\n“Hey Frank. Not fining much work today?” Keep it light and not-at-all adversarial, that’s the tactic. \n\n“Oh, hey EMR. Nah, man. This bitch back there didn’t pay me for picking up the dog crap in her yard.” He held up a plastic shopping bag, heavy with something resembling excrement. \n\n“Oh… bummer?” I wasn’t about to go advocate to the old lady on his behalf but I didn’t want him to think I wasn’t compassionate to his cause either. \n\n“Yeah. I think I’ma knock on some more doors then get back to my hood.” He nodded up the street in the direction I had hoped to corral him. Perfect. \n\n“Yeah, that’s not a bad idea man, what with people over here not OH MY GOD WHAT’S WRONG WITH YOUR HAND?!?!?” I had just noticed the hand that wasn’t clutching the bag of dog crap. His thumb was swollen to three times its usual size and the nail was missing. A deep gash ran the length of it, from tip to second knuckle, and it was oozing a green pus. The whole finger, in fact, had a green tint to it. \n\n“Oh, this? This ain’t nuthin’. I cut it last week.” He pondered the infected wound as though it was a hangnail. \n\n“No way, man. That’s frickin’ gangrene Frank! You need to get to the hospital.” I couldn’t tear my eyes from the infected appendage. \n\n“Nah, man. Screw the hospital. It’ll be ok, look.” He pulled out a large bottle of peroxide from a cargo pocket and poured a stream over it. The liquid quickly bubbled into a yellowy-white foam which he flung to the ground with a flick of his wrist. \n\n“See? It’s all good.” He held it up for me to inspect again but it almost made me vomit. A stream of peroxide, infected pus and some pinkish fluid flowed from the deep cut down onto his wrist and along to his elbow. The stench of it also hit me as it wafted up from the pile of flung-off peroxide foam.\n\n“Seriously, Frank, I’ll drive you right now.” \n\n“Naw, man, but thanks. I’ll just go home and rest. It’ll be better tomorrow.” He nodded, believing in his prognosis. \n\nI was hesitant to let him go but what could I do. “Uhhh… ok man. If it’s not better soon, do me a favor and call an ambulance, cool?” \n\n“Sure man, sure. See ya.” He clenched a fist around the dog-poop bag, furrowed his brow into an angry expression, and stomped away as I watched. “Bitch should’ve paid me. I picked up this shit and I’m not even gettin’ no money…” His mutters faded with each step. \n\nI called Jason almost immediately. “Dude; if you want round two with Frank, you might want to book it soon. I think he’s about to lose his thumb if not his whole arm. Or die maybe… Yeah, he’s probably going to die.”\n\nFrank is still kicking today though (I just checked – he recently got locked up for peeing in an old man’s yard and gave the address “’tween here and there” when asked by the cop). He never lost his thumb either. Whatever black magic luck charm he’s got is working for him while he continues to terrorize the elderly and make our jobs a little harder every day.\n",

        "text": "It was the middle of winter, and it was absolutely pissing it down. But that didn’t matter; I was only about three weeks out of the academy, still fresh face, wide eyed, and constantly excited for any call that came through. No mere rain could put a damper on my enthusiasm!    \n  \n  \n  \nI was working with two senior guys when a job came through for an absconder from a small mental health hostel next to the local hospital. I later learnt that it was a pretty common and sometimes even daily occurrence to have mental health absconders walk out from the hospital itself. They had limited space on their locked wards, and patients frequently walked out. It didn’t help that staff would ‘test’ patients to see if they could trust them by getting them to stroll down, unsupervised, to the nearby shops and pick up a pack of smokes. Needless to say, a lot of them chose not to stroll back, which was when we’d get the call to hunt them down.  \n  \n  \n  \nTechnically, the job was out of our patch, but we picked it up anyway. There was a little bit of urgency with this one; apparently the girl that had gone missing, Faith, had disappeared on previous occasions and made off hand comments about killing herself before, but this time she’d left behind a suicide note, which detailed her plan to drug herself and jump off a bridge. Her carers were extremely concerned, and were worried that she might be experiencing a psychotic episode.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe three of us jumped in the car (4WD with a secure pod on the back for undesirables and people you think might make a mess of the upholstery) and took off, patrolling around for our target.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt was dead. I mean, absolutely fucking dead. Winter, around eleven o’clock at night, still bucketing down; cats, dogs, emus, you name it, it’s coming down out of the sky, but there wasn’t a single soul on those streets apart from us. I don’t think we even saw another car. As we sat on top of one of the local bridges, one of the boys pointed down to the base of the pylon plunging into the river a good sixty feet below.  \n“See that bit of concrete sticking out?”  \n“Yeah?”  \n“Saw a guy that had jumped and landed on that, feet first. Didn’t kill him, but shattered everything up to his pelvis.”  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I took this bit of information in, I pondered what to do next. We’d been up and down every street, checked all the bridges, and still nothing. I tried giving her carer a call to see if she could shed any light, and as I did, a thought popped into my head; did she have a phone? It turned out that she did, and the carer had literally just received a single word text message from her; ‘Goodbye’. Well, at least we knew she had her phone with her. I decided to give it a crack, and dialled her number.  \n  \n  \nRemember at the start how I said I was fresh out of the academy? We’d done a little bit of mental health training, scenarios and the like, but having an actor pretending they can see someone in the corner is no comparison to trying to talk to someone who’s having a full blown psychotic episode. I was completely out of my depth. Twenty minutes might not sound like much, but when you’re trying to convince someone that you’re not an auditory hallucination, and begging them not to hang up and to tell you where they are, well, then twenty minutes is a damn long time.  \n  \n  \nIt was honestly twenty minutes of her babbling incomprehensible nonsense, of screaming and crying and wailing down the phone at me, of growling and snarling threats all before breaking into insane laughter that wouldn’t have been out of place coming from a six year old girl in a psycho head-spinning green-pea-vomit-spewing horror movie. Occasionally I’d get brief glimpses of sanity, but it was rare.  \n  \n  \nI tried everything I could think of to get her to tell me where she was. Counselling, coaxing, bribing; anything. Finally, *finally*, she gave me the name of a nearby suburb. Five minutes and we were there, but she wouldn’t tell us exactly where she was. I started asking her what she could see, and she slowly gave me just enough to figure out that she was hiding in an empty car park behind a string of shops.  \n  \n   \nAs we rolled in, I could see a figure standing in the rain, and her voice became frantic on the other end of the phone;  \n*“I have to go, they’re here, they’re coming for me!”*  \nI jumped out, waving the phone and telling her  \n“No, it’s ok; it’s me, from the phone? See? We just want to help you.”  \nThe boys stayed next to the car, seeing if I could coax her in and also doing their best to be good policemen and not get wet.  \n  \n  \nShe paused, and tilted her head to the side. As I got a bit closer, I got a good look at her eyes. I’d always heard about ‘crazy eyes’, but that was the first time I’d seen it, and I’ll never forget it. Maybe it’s a combination of mental health issues, and medication and whatever else, but there’s this look that sends shiver down your spine, when someone just stares straight through you, unblinking for what feels like forever. Faith certainly had crazy eyes alright.  \n  \n  \nShe was a pretty heavy girl. Probably a couple of inches taller than my gargantuan 5’4 frame, but she would have easily weighed in at ninety kilograms, or around two hundred pounds. She was wearing jeans and a pink hoodie, and was absolutely soaked. Her hands were tucked up inside the sleeves of her jumper.  \n  \n  \nI got about thirty feet away from her, and it was like standing near a wild animal. I could see that she was so unsure, and wanted to turn and run. I noticed she had a bit of an egg on her forehead with a decent split on it. The rain was helping it to flow down and cover her face.  \n  \n  \n“Are you alright? Your head…?”  \nI gestured to my own forehead, and nodded towards her. She looked confused for a second, and raised her hand to the cut, before bringing it back down to examine the blood on her finger tips, and then…  \n  \n  \nShe smiled, and told me “I did it to myself” and then shard of jagged glass hidden in her sleeve flowed down into her hand and fuck fuck fuck there’s a big crazy girl having a psychotic episode with a half a foot of glass standing a bit too close for my liking, and she’s grinning at me. Well, at least she wasn’t pissed at me, but still. I don’t think I’ve ever been so hyper aware of where my gun and taser were on my belt.  \n  \n  \nI asked her to put the glass down, but she was reluctant and her face scrunched into a scowl as she started to get upset. I told her that I didn’t want her to hurt herself again, or hurt me, and she thankfully agreed that she didn’t want to hurt me either. I managed to compromise with her, and get her to just place the glass at her feet. That way, she couldn’t hurt me, but it was still there if she wanted to pick it up.  \n  \n  \nI started trying to talk to her about getting help, and that her carers were concerned from her. She started telling me about why she was there. I hoped it was just the psychosis talking, but later found out it wasn’t.  \n  \n  \n“My parents raped me when I was little, you know. They took me, and fucked me, and raped me and they wouldn’t stop for years and years, and then they let their friends use me and rape me and I have demons in my head and I-“  \nShe went on and on, rocking backwards and forwards, fists clenched into little balls.  \n“I want to kill them. I’m going to kill them for what they did and then I’m going to kill me to make the voices stop and-“  \nAnd so it went on.  \n  \n  \nI tried to talk to her about going back to the hospital and getting help, and making the voices stop, but it was pointless, and she was having none of it. Just before she said she was done and turned to walk away, she looked me in the eye and growled out   \n“How am I supposed to kill them if I’m in hospital?”  \n  \n  \nWe were done with talking at that point. As she looked to walk off into the rain, the boys were out of the car and we each took a hold of her to guide her to the car. She went off. Fighting, kicking, screaming, biting; anything to make us let her go. Even with the three of us, we struggled to control her; it was like she had superhuman strength. I don’t think we could have got cuffs on no matter how hard we tried. We hauled her over to the car and I searched her quickly, making sure there was no more glass for her to hurt herself with then heaved her into the secure pod and shut the door.  \n  \n  \nIt took us ten minutes to get her to the hospital. Faith had been quietly sobbing to herself the whole time, but when we got there, she started firing up again, but it was no longer our problem. My last view of Faith, after we handed her over to the staff, was her in wheelchair, given enough sedative to knock a rhino out for a week, arms held down, ripping out an impressive world cup worthy kick that swung high over her head and smacked a security guard in the nose, knocking him arse over tit.  \n  \n  \nAnd that was my real, on road introduction to mental health jobs.\n",

        "text": "So since there's no tag for criminal justice conferences, I have to go with ride along, since this incident happens while surrounded by current and former law enforcement officers.\n\nThe year is 2009, and the place is Jacksonville, Florida.  I've been a member of a national criminal justice fraternity for about 2 years, and I'm in this very flat and warm locale in the last week of March for our national conference.  These are wonderful events, as the competitions we have are quite challenging, the training classes we get to take are intensive and often hard to find, the company is fun, and it's a week's vacation from school under the auspice of \"class related.\"  It was Wednesday evening, and six of us are in the hotel bar.\n\nI should describe the group:  Me, 26, a community college CJ student and at the time, wildland firefighter with the federal government.  Allie, a retired director of adult corrections for a county in California.  Byron, a parole officer from Sacramento.  Greg, a retired Chicago police captain.  Matt, a SWAT sergeant from Missouri.  Steve, a patrol officer from Tennessee and former Marine EOD tech.  And Lori, a paramedic supervisor from the east coast.  I'm the youngest at the table by at least 10 years, as these people are the \"high and mighties\" of the group, members for decades in some cases, and connected to law enforcement officials high and low all across the country.  They're my friends, my frat brothers and sisters, and also USDA Grade A resume reference material.  The liquor is flowing, and war stories are being told amid bouts of laughter.  A good time is definitely being had.\n\n'Round about midnight, as we're all contemplating going to bed so we can be semi-functional for the hand-to-hand training scheduled for the next morning, we notice that the bar has gotten louder, but only in one very specific area.  Everyone else has gotten quiet.  We look around and spot the source of the profanity-laced noise, and individual who is leaning heavily on the bar and loudly denegrating the bartender.  His appearance, well, let's just say it didn't fit with what one would normally consider the clientel of a Hilton Hotel.  Dirty, desheveled, torn, he looked like he'd been tossed from a moving train and into a large patch of blackberrys down wind from a coal plant.\n\nIt's pretty obvious he's drunk, and the bartender has done something to become the subject of his ire.  A few minutes of quiet eavesdropping reveals this to be the audacity to make this fine man pay for the nearly $150 in drinks and food he's had.  Really, who does that, demand people pay for their food and drink?\n\nAbout this time, the one waitress comes around, and says she's asking for all the patrons to leave, for their own safety.  A sensible precaution, but the badges that get produced convince her that we can take care of ourselves.  Also offers of assistance in case things get violent.  And a request for a round of water, it's time to sober up.\n\nShe tells us 911 has already been called, that we don't need to stay, but by this time our main character's behavior has us all seriously worried.  He's making threats to the bartender, the hotel, and the cops, stating he'd \"already killed five of those fucking pigs, I'll kill any more that show up!\"  At least, that's what I think he said, he was really drunk, his words sounding like a 75 album on a 33 1/3 player.  We're not gonna leave until the local cops show up and take control, just to be sure.\n\nSoon enough, they do.  I cannot remember for the life of me what the first deputy looked like, but the image of the second deputy shouldering his way through the door is etched into my mind's eye.  Think Michael Clarke Duncan, only taller, broader, looking pissed off, and wearing the tan uniform of the Jacksonville County Sheriff.  Even the jaded Greg was looking at this guy in awe.  If he went swimming in the ocean he could be classified as a small island nation, and be given funding for a team to compete in the Olympics.  The kind of guy who looks like he can one-punch a camel.  I hope you get the picture.\n\nThe suspect certainly noticed, because his bluster and ranting drained away about as quickly as the color in his face did.  He barely came up to mid-chest on the deputy, if that.  A deep bass rumbled sounded, and it took me a moment to realize it wasn't the wrath of God coming down to smite the sinner, it was the deputy asking what kind of trouble was going on that would cause him to be called down at such an hour.\n\nThe suspect visibly gulped, and began answering the deputy's questions.  But after a few back-and-forth responses, his drunken bravado returned, as he suddenly reached back behind the bar, grabbed a pint glass, and swung it at the deputy's head.  While maybe not the best weapon, had it connected it probably would have done some serious damage.  However, despite his incredible size, the deputy was surprisingly fast.  He took a step back, causing the glass to pass in front of his face by several inches, and then a very large step forward, slamming into the suspect like a Peterbuilt slamming into a Honda Civic.  The suspect rebounded off the bar and hit the ground, followed quickly by both deputies.\n\nWith the usual speed of such events, the cry of \"KNIFE! KNIFE!\" came from the non-descript partner, followed by Matt, Steve, and Byron leaping to their feet to run in and assist, followed by a much deeper \"TASER, TASER\" and the stuttering clack of the suspect beginning his ride on the electric rhino.  Then a very quiet \"holy shit,\" which I believe came from me.\n\nThe fight now out of him, the suspect was cuffed and brought to his feet.  The six of us at that point spontaneously burst out in applause, along with a few cheers.  The deputies then lead the suspect out of the bar, asking for an ambulance over the radio and telling us to stay there so we could fill out statements.  Now laughing with the broken tension, we sat back down, ordered a celebratory round, and waited for someone to come take our statements.\n\nI have a couple more stories from these conferences, if anyone is interested.",

        "text": "I am a police cadet in England. I am one of my forces first modern cadets.  There were no cadets for about 30 years and they decided to bring them back. I was lucky. I had always wanted to be a cop and this was the perfect opportunity. I was 17 when I went on this patrol and I think I will remember it for a long time.\n\n\nOne day I was patrolling with a special Constable (volunteer officers that carry the powers of a normal officer but don’t get paid) and another cadet. We started the shift, leaving the police station the officer said \"let's just go and check something. Stay back though because this guy doesn't like me\" he them informed us of a heroin addict that was living in the bushes by the entrance of a swimming pool. We had some calls from unhappy parents as it isn't a pretty sight when a junky is coming at you and has a needle sticking out of his neck. We get to the swimming baths, the officer deploys his baton to move the bushes out of the way. The guy isn't home. Me and the other cadet (let's call him Cadet B) were really excited as we had never been on patrol with an officer. Normally it's with PCSO's (Police Community Support Officers. They Deal with low level crime and hand out leaflets in the area where they work. It can get really boring) the officer calls us over to look at his home. It was next to the heater for the pool so he had warmth, there was a blanket and a very thin mattress. He was also covered from rain as there was an umbrella stuck in the ground covering his bed. The officer told us that this guy would spend around £50 a day on drugs. We walked away and continued our foot patrol and made our way to a nearby park, making sure there were no anti-social behaviour happening. We started to walk towards some steps to leave the park. Nothing was going on it was clearly very quiet, it was during the week and about 2 in the afternoon. People were at work and kids were at school. So we started to walk past the job centre, under some tunnels to bring us out near a retail park. Then we started to walk around and some Asian lady approaches us praising us for our work in the community. She was clearly very happy to see us and it was nice because it isn't normal for someone to praise us. Then finally a job; a female approaches us. Her exact words are \"there is a guy on X street in a grey jumper and with two girls threatening to bite peoples noses. He's clearly drunk and needs to be stopped\" so we noted the description and we made our way towards the suspect. Someone matching that description exactly, passes us and we approach him and his two friends. We informed them someone matching their description was threatening people and we asked if it was them. They weren't happy and thought they were being setup. He then told us that someone was threatening people further down the road.\n\n\nWe arrived and there was a guy sat there very drunk. Believe it or not he was with our little homeless friend. He was sat with a bottle of Stella Artois in his hand, half empty, with a box of 23 empty bottles next to him on a bin. He had wet himself and he was just sat on a bench. The officer then proceeded to speak to the man \"what's your name mate?\" no response \"what's your name\" for the purpose of this story we will call him Steve, as I cannot disclose his name. \"can you tell me your name please?\"\n\n\"Steve\"\n\n\"Steve what?\" \n\nHe just mumbled words that were supposed to be his name. The officer then asks whereabouts he lives. He informed us that he lived in a hotel in a nearby town. Behind us were two taxi drivers having an argument and we thought we'd leave it; until the female taxi driver shouts at the other taxi driver.\n\n\"Shut up or I'll smash your fucking face in!\" \n\nThe officer turns around and does a quick risk assess. You could see it in his face. He looks at the drunk, and back at us, and says \"watch him, let me deal with them a minute.\" He walks off to the taxi drivers to tell them to shut up and calm down. \n\nMe and Cadet B are watching Steve and he suddenly stands up. Never being in a situation like this made it suddenly very scary. I was always a very quiet child and never went out with friends. So me and Cadet B steps back. I could feel in my stomach that something wasn’t right. He then looks at me and starts to walk towards me. It's now getting very scary, my hearts racing, doing 100 miles an hour. His shoulders are broadened and his fists clenched. His eyes are locked onto me. He gets up in my face so I take a step back to get out his way. My mind was saying \"don’t turn your back on him\"; he continues to walk towards me. I pushed him away from me and he stumbles back. Big mistake. It was like waving your hand to try and hit a wasp, angering it making it want to hurt you more. I honestly thought the guy was going to hit me. I am only a cadet. I carry no vest, no baton, no CS spray, no cuffs, I have no powers, nothing. I didn’t stand a chance. I told cadet B to get the officer and the guy turns on him has him backed up against a wall. Cadet B was my best friend. I would sooner the guy punch me then him. So I started to walk up to him. \n\nI have no idea what I was going to do. \n\nThe officer then turns around and walks back towards us. \n\nSteve turns around and makes his way towards the officer. \n\nThe officer then pushes him; palms to shoulders.\n\nHe tells Steve \"mate go home or you will be arrested for drunk and disorderly in a public place\" \n\nSteve walks back to the officer, both are standing in the middle of the road, the officer then shouts \"GO HOME OR YOU WILL BE ARRESTED FOR DRUNK AND DISORDERLY\" at this point me and Cadet B are stood watching thinking we are about to see our first arrest. We would have been perfectly happy with a straight forward arrest. But no. \n\nThe officer then decided that he needs arresting. \n\nHe drew his handcuffs.\n\nHe attempted to make the arrest. \n\nThe guy then snapped and swung his arms, knocking the handcuffs out of his hand; causing them to skid along the ground. \n\nI then heard a shout \"grab them handcuffs!\" \n\nI rushed in picking them up. In complete shock, still recovering from the thought of being attacked, for the first time in my life. \n\nI offered them to the officer. The officer is in a headlock and does a leg sweep in an attempt to get the suspect to the floor. Suddenly the officer is on the floor with the suspect still holding the headlock; but now he was angrier he was tightening his grip on the officer; trying to kill him by the looks of things. \n\nThe panic button had been pressed and we were getting tons of abuse. People passing by, not caring that the officer is going to get killed, shouting \"you waste of tax money! Get a real job!\" The officer then gets out of the headlock and a brave taxi driver steps in and asks if we can let him help that officer. \n\nI thought \"go for it\". My inspector has told us we aren't allowed for \"insurance purposes\".\n\nThe taxi driver was about to help, until I saw the officer get out the CS spray. \n\nI then told the taxi driver \"stand back CS is being deployed!\"\n\nThe officer turns his head away from the suspect and sprays the suspect in the face. \n\nThe wind blew some of the CS back and it went up my nose and down my throat.\n\nIt burnt. \n\nIt was like having acid in my throat. Luckily I didn’t get it to bad, otherwise things could have gotten worse.\nAfter that I turned around and saw a guy walking on the path shouting at us \"Police Brutality!\" \n\nThe insults were getting more frequent and more unhappy civilians gathering. I turned around to check if the officer was okay. He had got out of his headlock predicament and was on top of the suspect trying to get his hands behind his back. They were on the side of the road so I figured it would be safe to get cars moving. I started to let the cars through. The road eventually cleared and just in time. \n\nA police car came flying down the road, responding to the panic button that had been pressed a few minutes before. Two officers jump out of the car and assist the officer they managed to get cuffs on. Another five cars appear out of nowhere and more officers arrive.\n\nThey got the guy in the back of a car and started to go to custody. Me and Cadet B are stranded and two officers said they'd take us back to the station. We got back to the station and went straight to the canteen to sit and reflect on what had just happened.\n\nThe suspect got 6 weeks imprisonment for common assault, assault on a constable, and drunk &amp; disorderly. No doubt he'll be out before that.\n\nAll the police officers on reddit, Be safe. You never know what's around the corner.",

        "text": "Since my last story had some positive reception, I'll share another.\n\nMy first ride-along with the state troopers started off slow, even on a rainy Friday night shift. Two minutes on the road we stopped for a stranded motorist and ended up waiting an hour for a tow truck to show up, mostly just listening to whatever new Katy Perry song was on the radio. I tried to think of questions to ask the officers to keep us entertained but wasn't coming up with much.\n\nWhen the truck finally showed up, we headed off to our beat on the Interstate. As we crested a hill, we spotted another officer helping a stranded pick-up. We spotted it too late to stop and assist. One of the officer's asked, \"Is that Kimmel? Why's he over here?\" We took the next off-ramp and circled back.\n\nBy the time we got back the other officer had left (probably to head to his beat), but the truck was still there on the shoulder. This was a construction zone, and the shoulder was barely the width of one vehicle, with concrete barriers on the edge. You couldn't pull over any further even if you wanted to.\n\nWhen we pulled up we spotted the problem: flat tire. Then we spotted the bigger problem: the driver was changing the flat tire, while sticking 3 feet into the 65mph lane. Cue the expected response from one of the officers, \"What the hell is this guy doing....he's halfway into the road! Quick, stop the car but keep it a little to the left so this guy doesn't get hit.\"\n\nWe had the lights to the rear on, trying to alert drivers to the hazard. Like I mentioned earlier, this was just over the crest of a hill. Any warning drivers were going to have was going to be a late one.\n\nThe officer in the passenger seat got out, walking up to the guy changing the tire. He busted out his flashlight to try and wave passing cars away while the guy with the flat kept working. The other officer driving stayed in the car, periodically relaying his concern. \"This is bad.\" \"Look at how close that car got!\" \"Jesus, that was close...\" I stayed in the car as traffic whizzed by us so close the cruiser was rocking.\n\nAfter a few tense minutes, the driver of the pick-up finished the job and took off. The other officer hopped back in. \"Man, that guy was changing his tire without a care in the world. He was completely oblivious to how dangerous that was. And you!\" He was talking to his partner. \"What did you do? You just sat in the car, not helping at all!\"\n\nHis partner shot back, \"I was helping!\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, what were you doing? I was out there trying to wave cars off and get the guy to hurry up.\"\n\n\"I was...sitting in the car...with the lights on. I was a barrier, man!\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure. A highway patrol officer afraid to get out on the highway. Imagine that.\"",

        "text": "A few months into my department's hiring process, my Background Investigator told me, \"If you haven't done a ride-along yet, you probably should. Some people find they think being a police officer is what they want to do, and the ride-along completely changes that.\"\n\nFollowing his advice, I called that day for a ride along. I scheduled it for a night shift, coincidentally on the first rainy night of the year in a place where water from the sky is foreign concept. The Sergeant at the time let me know I \"picked one hell of a night for a first ride-along.\" He was right.\n\nNight shift means two officers, so I sat in the back. The first few hours were just cruising around, pulling people over for equipment violations, checking for DUI's mostly. We headed over to a spot near some local bars to increase the odds of finding a DUI. As we were leaving the area, we got a call in: Code 2 11-80 (Urgent; Accident - Major Injury).\n\nAt the time we were on a side street doing 25mph and I didn't think much of it. Maybe someone got a little tap and fell over. The officer in the front passenger seat turned around and explained the call, with some obvious adrenaline in his voice, \"Pedestrian vs. vehicle. If you don't want to see a dead body, don't get out of the car.\" I realized when you're on a ride along with state troopers, there are no gentle pedestrian vs. vehicle accidents.\n\nCode 2 was pretty much one step below officer in distress, so we booked it to the location. One thing I picked up: full lights, sirens, and horn going does not mean people will see you.\n\nWe started a traffic break as we arrived on scene (stopping the freeway by swerving across all the lanes while slowing down). We stopped completely in the middle of the highway to set up road flares. The officers both got out and told me to stay in the car. A couple seconds later one asked the other, \"Should we be closer?\" So they both hopped back in, moved up a few hundred yards, and stopped on the shoulder closer to the accident. Two other troopers were already on scene, as was a firetruck and ambulance.\n\nSo began the flare work. I became the flare box holder while one of the officers laid them down. My directions were, \"Walk backwards and keep one eye on traffic. People like to run the flares.\" A few seconds later I spotted a driver use an on-ramp as an off-ramp to avoid the traffic. Incredible.\n\nAs we approached the scene, flares in hand, walking backwards, a firefighter came up to us. \"Watch where you step. There are...pieces all around here.\" The officer shined his light down near us to reveal some brain matter near our feet. He panned it towards the middle of the road and we could see it was pretty well spread out.\n\nWe walked back and forth twice, laying down 4 overlapping flares, tiptoeing as we went. By the time we finished, the Sergeant on duty showed up. He asked me, \"Have you ever seen a dead body before?\" Nope. \"Do you want to see a dead body?\" I thought for a second before telling him not really. \"Good answer.\"\n\nThe road flare officer went to the car to grab some equipment, so I tagged along with the other officer. \"Let's head up to the front.\" We walked up past the firetruck and ambulance. There was a tarp in front of the ambulance with the victim underneath, some pieces hanging out. We asked the firefighters if they knew what happened. It turns out the victim was somehow on the center divider, and he suddenly darted into traffic. The first car clipped him with his side mirror while trying to avoid him, causing the victim to fall over. Another two cars ran over the victim, apparently not having enough time to react.\n\nThe officers started their accident investigation, marking important points like keys, cell phones, skid marks, etc. Once the coroner showed up, the tarp was removed to take pictures and load the body. The injuries I saw suggest the victim died pretty quickly.\n\nTraffic was able to flow by in one lane at this point. Every car with a passenger had their cell phone out the window, trying to take pictures or record video. While I can understand the fascination, this was probably something most of them didn't want to see. Two of the officers held up a tarp up, blocking the view of the cameras. One of the officers holding the tarp motioned to me, \"I bet you didn't expect to see that on your first ride-along.\"",

        "text": "Continuing my series “Profiles of Interesting Characters” is today’s entry: The Legend. He’s another homeless guy (or was) but his story isn’t nearly as sad as Felix’s. \n\nIn my department, and probably others as well, every district has those one or two guys who are the constant pains in the rear for every shift. In the district I worked as a rookie, my “guy” was Pineapple. \n\nI’m not sure how he was gifted the moniker (nor do I truly want to know, what with my understanding of homeless guy’s propensities for putting things in bodily orifices that shall go unnamed) but that was how everyone knew him: Pineapple. He was a short, stocky guy, with a beer-belly he proudly showed off most days by flipping his shirt up over its mountainous expanse and strutting around the day laborers like a peacock. He always had a long Fu Manchu mustache that he would sometimes braid or wear split into multiple spikes like some drunken demon whose favorite pastime was public urination. \n\nFor some reason he insisted on other people calling him “Cuba”, and if you let him, he’d regale you with an ever-evolving story of his harrowing escape from the island nation and his drift across the sea to Miami. Sometimes he’d depart after a fist fight with Fidel Castro (“Joo know Castro, si?”) and other versions would have him fleeing an angry husband, chasing Pineapple with a machete after discovering his wife in an affair with the troll-like man. In one of his drunken moments of brilliance, he carved the word “Cuba” into his arm with a kitchen knife. It was thenceforth used as a prop to demonstrate the validity of his wild claims of citizenship and subsequent defection. He was a true wordsmith, painting vibrant mental images with his usually slurred, gravelly voice. \n\nMy first encounter with Pineapple was also my first day on the job. My trainer decided I needed to pop my “physical arrest cherry” and he knew just where to find a willing subject. We pulled into the barrio and he began scanning the small patches of grass and well-worn shady sitting spots underneath evergreen landscaping trees. Finally, he spotted his prey.\n\n“Stop! Over there.” He pointed to a small hill behind a graffiti improved brick wall behind the local 7-11. There were three mounds of humanity laying supine on the grass, empty beer cans scattered around them like a stone hedge devoted to drunkenness. (If you were to observe the scene on the solar equinox, they say the sun rises directly between two crumpled Heineken cans and aligns itself perfectly with Pineapple’s exposed navel.)\n\nWe got out of the cruiser to make our approach and I silently pressed my door shut so as not to rouse our quarry. My trainer, however, had no silly qualm against such startling noises and slammed his door harder than usual. He smirked and looked to me, “See?” he said, before shaking his head and walking briskly up to the men, his hand resting on the hilt of his long cocobolo baton. \n\nWe stood over them a minute, taking in their splendor. On either side of Pineapple, who was lying flat on his back – sun battered face exposed to its adversary once more, a man lay on his side, facing Pineapple and snoring quietly so as not to wake their hibernating king. Pineapple himself was emitting a “grunt-bellow” call with every breath, sleep apnea taking its toll on his oxygen intake. If there were any amorous moose in the vicinity, I’m sure they would have been waiting in line to meet this seductive Don Juan. \n\nMy trainer pulled his baton and poked Pineapple in the belly. It jiggled but Pineapple didn’t respond immediately. He poked him again, harder this time, on his shoulder. Pineapple sleepily swatted it away and rolled over on one side, now face-to –face with one of his worshippers. \n\n“Get up Pineapple.” My trainer angrily commanded. I noticed Pineapple’s eyes slowly part at that. He rolled back to his previous position and took us in with squinted eyes. \n\n“Hold on, hold on.” He said as he reached in to his back pocket. I tensed, remembering my training from the academy and that hands going where I can’t see them is a bad thing. I relaxed a second later, however, due to the contemptuous head shake and sigh from my trainer. \n\nPineapple pulled out a wallet from his back pocket and flipped it open for us. A shiny silver police badge glinted up at us with reflected sun. \n\n“What the hell is that?” My trainer asked, genuinely surprised by Pineapple’s reveal. \n\n“I’m police.” Pineapple replied simply before collapsing back into his beer coma.\n\n“Jesus.” My trainer reached down and snatched the badge from Pineapple’s non-resisting hand. “How the hell did this moron get a hold of this thing?” The badge was from a neighboring jurisdiction and had a badge number etched over the shield. \n\n“You lock him up; I’ll start working on this mess.” My trainer instructed me over his shoulder as he walked back to the cruiser. \n\nMy time had come. I was finally going hands on for the first time. Months of academy tests and practical scenarios led to this moment. I put on my latex gloves and then my black batter’s gloves on top of those and reached down, grabbing Pineapple’s shoulder and giving a good shake. \n\n“Get up.” I tried to sound official. \n\nPineapple’s eyes rolled as his lids reluctantly parted again. “You don’t arrest other cops, mang!” He was perturbed by my lack of professional courtesy. \n\n“No, really, get up. It’s time to go.” I stepped back as he, slowly and with much effort, bent at the waist to sit up straight.\n\n“C’mon, mang! Only drunk! Pleeeeeease?” I looked over my shoulder to ensure Pineapple’s begging went unnoticed. I was unsure how to deal with this, the academy had forgotten to brief the scenario of a pleading, homeless, drunk. \n\n“Nope, stand up, we’re going.” I pulled my cuffs out as he rose to unsteady feet. \n\n“Hold on, hold on.” He reached into his front pocket and pulled out a toothbrush. He then began scrubbing his teeth, his lazy eyes looking around with no concern from my presence. I stood statue-like, handcuffs in hand, trying to noodle out how to resolve this and not get chastised by my trainer.\n\nPineapple pocketed the toothbrush but put up a single finger, “Wait,” he said, before diving back into his other pocket. He pulled out a cellophane wrapped, red-and-white mint and popped it into his mouth. He dropped the wrapper absent-mindedly towards the ground and it came to rest on the forehead of one of his still-sleeping subjects.\n\n“Ok.” He turned around and presented his hands behind his back in a perfect cuffing posture. It was something I knew how to work with, exactly as I had been taught in the academy. I quickly employed my speed-cuffing technique and double locked them before stepping back to admire my work. \n\n“No, no, no. All wrong, mang.” Pineapple said as he wriggled one of his hands out. “Too loose. Use the chain ones, mang.” He presented his hands again, this time one of them dangling my failure from a wrist. I glanced back at my trainer who was now on the phone, animatedly explaining what we had found to whoever was on the other line. He hadn’t noticed my flub and I quickly swapped out my hinge cuffs for the smaller pair of chain cuffs.\n\n“Good!” Pineapple approved of my second attempt and began to walk to the cruiser door.\n\nAfter a search and resolution to the badge issue (the cop hadn’t even realized he was missing his credentials so we just swept it under the rug for him to save face) my trainer asked me how it went.\n\n“No problem. He’s… cuffed and searched.” I stared straight ahead and felt his eyes boring into my temple. \n\nA thud from the back caught both of our attention. “He did good, mang!” Pineapple hollered from the back. My trainer nodded in approval and took out his notebook to record my first arrest for posterity.\n\nFor years, Pineapple roamed the streets of the barrio. Stories of his kookiness would trickle in and be shared over beers at cop gatherings:\n\n“Once, I rolled up on him and he was wearing a hard hat, cut-off jeans, and a reflective vest. That’s it. He saluted me before I put the cuffs on.”\n\n“Oh yeah, were you there the time he made that hat out of spoiled fruit from the bodega? He pranced around like the Chiquita banana lady and sang some crazy Spanish song until the stink and flies made him throw it away.”\n\n“I missed that one but I rolled up on him doing bench presses in front of the 7-11 at three in the morning. Still not sure where he found a bench and weights…”\n\n“What about when he found that old guitar somewhere. I think it only had two strings left but he dragged it all over until he ended up smashing it on some dude’s head. Classic!”\n\nWe even made a station calendar commemorating him with twelve pictures of his crazy costumes and get-ups. I still have it somewhere; I need to dig it out.\n\n\nPineapple’s antics came to an end one blaring summer afternoon. Someone called in a drunk complaint, (“A man is mooning passing cars!”) and we all immediately knew who the culprit was. When I arrived, it had already gone to hell. Pineapple had seen the incoming cruisers and instead of his usual “Give-up” attitude, he had made a dash for a small tree planted in the median of the shopping center. Somehow he had scampered up, baby-bear-like, before the first officer could grab him. \n\nThe spindly tree swayed with the burden of his weight and he clung tight, three stories above the crowd of awestruck cops and day laborers. There was nothing we could do, really. A boss showed up and took in the spectacle.\n\n“Call rescue, get a truck out here with a bucket. We’ll go up and get him if he doesn’t want to come down.” His solution was offered King Solomon like and he retreated to his air-conditioned car to watch the show.\n\nFire board rolled up and we explained our plan: three cops would be lifted up to Pineapple’s perch. Two would be on grab-and-pull duty; the third would have a Taser on the ready. Pineapple would be snatched from the tree and shoved into the cramped bucket to be lowered and ferried off to jail again.\n\nThe plan started out well, Pineapple stared down at the ascending arrest team as they rose from the sidewalk. Just as they were about to grab him, Pineapple let go his iron grip. He began to plummet and we all let out a gasp of surprise below. The two “grabber” officers did their duty though, and were able to catch him and pull him in. He immediately went against his normally passive standard and began struggling with the three cops who were quickly being dropped back to sea level. They spilled out in a wrestling match and several of the waiting cops piled on. \n\nIn the end, Pineapple was charged with disorderly conduct, drunk in public, three counts of assault on an officer, and felony exposure (the original complainant had her three year old in the car who saw all of the glory of his nether-region while they passed by). He was finally going to get his return trip to his home country. While justice was technically being served, his absence definitely changed the flavor of the neighborhood for the blander. \n\nSeveral months passed and I was making a pass through the barrio. As I drove by the day laborers, I noticed a large crowd had formed around a central figure. It was Pineapple, returned from the dead. I was amazed and went to join the fray of people listening to his gravelly story of escape and vindication. To hear him tell it, his skills as a potential international spy had been recognized and immigration deputized him to invade Cuba. He double crossed them, however, and made his way back to the humble streets of the barrio. \n\nOf course I checked with my ICE contact to really dig up what had happened. Apparently, Pineapple had continued his insistence of Cuban residence while in Ice custody. He had no ID (never did as far as I could tell) and he was held pending deportation while ICE tried to figure out what his real status was. Cuba denied having anything to do with him. They refused to receive him and said they had no record of his birth or citizenship. On a whim, he was courted to several other countries to try and find out the truth. Eventually El Salvador, of all places, admitted to being his native land. \n\nSomehow, Pineapple battled within the system and had his felonies all dropped to lesser crimes. His appeal against the deportation was won due to a lack of conviction of a crime of “moral turpitude”, and he was given a free government ride back to the barrio and a friendly boot once they arrived. \n\nHis long stint in jail enabled Pineapple to shed his alcohol dependency. He sobered up, became a regular, run-of-the-mill day laborer, and to this day, still resides in an apartment in the barrio with some of his Salvadoran buddies.\n",

        "text": "Had received a few messages a while back when I posted this in /r/protectandserve for some details on this. Didn’t think anything of it until I saw this sub. Read a few of EMJ’s stories and was inspired enough to share one of my crazier calls and the events leading up to it. This happened about 4 years ago and has been one of those things that stuck with me like a bad dream you can’t quite shake out of your mind.\n\nBit of a backstory: I work for a University Police Department in a large metropolitan city. We have a fairly large campus that’s integrated in to the city; that is, you can’t tell where the city ends or where the university begins. It offers a unique mix of usual college shenanigans (alcohol, drugs, petty theft) along with the crime and cultural uniqueness of an urban college. Like most urban colleges, we get a large amount of homeless around as well, adding another unique twist to the culture (University wants us to get rid of them, city says they can stay, etc. etc. etc.). \n\nIt’s not exactly a dangerous area, but has a fair mix of stuff ranging from simple drug possession to shootings. Like I’ve heard from some of my friends who also are University LEO’s, it’s not a unique place. Fairly typical and routine, and generally just boring as all hell. We receive our police powers from the city government (same arrest powers as the city police), and our jurisdiction is anywhere that is Cleary reportable: any owned or leased property to the university, and any sidewalks or adjacent streets to the property. Most of the city police are pretty cool and they don’t usually give us a hard time. We need them to do transports for us for our prisoners since they run the jail, so sometimes things get tough when we get a lazy officer or someone who doesn’t think University Police are real police.\n\nI just came off of my weekend and was working overtime on day work. It was the middle of February on a cold and clear day, perfect for a good bike ride around a college campus that was recovering from its own weekend of binge drinking and massive parties. I went to roll call with a slight headache from my own weekend exodus, and was starving for a large and greasy breakfast. I was told this was a thing on day work, with their crew having the luxury of enjoying breakfast at the university hospital cafeteria that we evening folk did not have the pleasure to engage in.\n\nI sat next to my buddy Josh in the roll call room. Josh is about my height (average) but much bulkier; a byproduct of good old Irish genes combined with a love for massive amounts of greasy beef, potatoes, and whiskey. I started in the security sector of the PD and was promoted to Police Officer around the time he came in. At the academy, we hung out and quickly became close after getting thrown on to the evening shift together. He was a jokester and the forefront of office gossip, but had enough common sense and book smarts to make a fine police officer when he wanted to apply himself. Most of the time, he passed off the routine calls to the rookies and generally didn’t do much until something serious popped off.\n\n“How was it?” He asked in a hushed tone. There was another of our friends in roll that day that was unable to attend our weekend outing due to last minute girlfriend issues and he did not need to overhear our conversation. \n\nSam was probably the most book smart of any of the people that came through the doors of the PD. Ask him a question, he had an educated opinion and answer within seconds and could solve any issue with pure brain power. He was rail thin and tall, but had a natural athletic ability that won him points in the academy for sheer determination and willpower. Right at that moment, he was staring at us from across the room with a look of pure hatred, possibly for the torment we gave him for skipping out on our planned evening.\n\n“It was great. The most epic party EVER. Shame that SOME OF US could not attend.” I said in a slightly higher pitch so that my voice carried across the room. I caught Josh’s attention and flicked my eyes towards Sam, who was visibly fuming for not being included in the conversation. Josh rolled his eyes at him and started a school-girl giggle fest with me that lasted until the Sergeant stepped in.\n\nThe usual BOLO’s rolled around and several issues with accountability of equipment were discussed by the old-timer. Sergeant Cookie was pushing 30 years on the job, had lost the majority of his hair from a career of overworked/underpaid hardship, had a full belly that poured over his belt, and drank no fewer than five Diet Cokes a day. With all the sodium and artificial sugar running through his veins (as well as his age), he was a walking mass of paranoia, high blood pressure, and complexes that ran deeper than any of us could begin to fathom.\n\n“Kik, South patrol. Josh, take West. Fitz, North with the auxiliary (students going through Forensics and needed police experience to complete the course). Paul on East.” I turned to Josh and gave him a poke as we were assigned to our favorite patrols and could immediately run to the hospital for breakfast, then to the “spot” for some general debauchery. \n\nSam poked his hand up “Hey, Sarge?” Sergeant Cookie went to his clipboard and looked it over for a moment before turning back to Sam and shrugged his shoulders. “I dunno. Relief? I thought you were on leave today…” Sam groaned, very loudly. Relief units were the quintessential clean up unit that checked on the fixed posts and security officers to see if they needed anything, and generally were used to fill whatever spot gets taken due to incidents. Normally, it’s a foot beat, since the cruisers were usually filled by patrol and with the recent weather, it can mean the difference between frostbite and a nice warm cruiser cabin. \n\nRoll Call ended with a start, and Josh and I ran towards the equipment room to check out bike keys and radios. I checked my gear one last time as Josh signed out his equipment. Today, the nylon rig I had was slouching ever so slightly to the right under the weight of the equipment and was throwing my balance off a bit. I had recently lost some weight from my wife’s pregnancy (sympathy weight, GO!) and hadn’t quite adjusted my rig to comfort level.\n\n“Got a limp today, I see. I told you guys about playing Tarzan in the bedroom at night.” Josh flashed me a cocky grin as he made fun of our recent addition. I gave him the finger and laid out the battle plan “Let’s hit the hospital and go to the spot. I’m liable to cook the glue out of my shoes and eat the rubber it if we don’t do this soon.”\n\nWe checked our bikes out and did the quick maintenance checks that IPMBA mandates before patrolling on a bike. Usually we skip this, however, several of the guys reported some asshole was returning patrol bikes with flat tires and not changing the tubes out. Eventually, they stacked up until oncoming personnel were forced to change out a flat before shift, which took them off the street for extended periods of time. After ensuring we had fresh batteries for the air horns and light riggings, we took off at a brisk pace towards the West side of campus and the Hospital. \n\nThe streets were quiet, with little to no traffic. The outgoing shift started to filter in and we stopped to chat with some of the guys from Mids. Some of them were older guys who still clung to the glory days of rip-roaring and riding dirty while chasing drunks down the middle of Main Street and getting in to fistfights at the corner pub that attracted dozens of underage hooligans looking to score cheap beer at a place that was notorious for carding with folded up five dollar bills. \n\nRay was a younger guy who had just gotten out of the Army. He had a buzz cut and was well groomed, as if he was fresh out of boot. The ribbons on his chest plate glistened in the morning sun. Most were Outstanding Achievement ribbons due to the various arrests he had in his short time on Mids. He was a go-getter and hungry for action, much like I was when I first came to the department. Time hadn’t taken its toll yet and he was still as lean and frosty as I remembered him a year ago when he first stepped in to my cruiser for FTI.\n\n“Sup, Kik. How’s the wife?” I kept my eyes on the road behind his cruiser for oncoming traffic. “Still kicking. How’s yours?” He breathed in sharply and pulled his sunglasses off his face. “She’s adjusting. Midnights has taken me away from her at night and she misses me. She’ll get over it…” He turned towards Josh. “I see you guys are taking the easy life on days. Don’t get caught with your zipper down writing up a babe.” He laughed then and I had to smile. \n\nJosh was constantly making fun of day work guys for being too complacent and living the dream out in the sun. He got caught by one of the day work guys held over on a detail with the bottom of his blue shirt poking out from his unzipped pants while stopping one of the fresh blonde hotties for a drinking in public offense. The day work guy took a picture with his cell phone and it circulated around the department like wildfire under the title: “Evenings can’t even dress themselves properly without the Admin.” Day work says Admin keeps their people in line and squared away, and evenings bumbles in a sloppy mess from lack of sleep and lack of administrative supervision. \n\nWe said our goodbyes and headed to the hospital. Stopping at the cafeteria, we skipped the prepared meals section and fruits/veggies cooler for the cooking station and ordered eggs, bacon, homefries, and toast. After dropping the brimming Styrofoam containers in to our trunk bags, we made for the “spot” on the South side of campus.\n\nThe “spot” was a driveway that ran under one of our academic buildings and spilled on to an on-ramp that lead to a major artery that cut through the South side of campus. It had high walls containing a parking deck that was open on two sides, giving you a full view of the surrounding suburbia. It was a nice place to relax and have a smoke out of the public eye, and was a good place to shoot the shit while still being close enough to respond to calls if needed. The entrance was on the opposite side of the building and we rode through the gates, waving at the security guard who never even bothered to look up from his PSP as he shot a wave towards us.\n\nWe pulled up to the back side of the parking deck and laid out our prizes on the wall overlooking the on-ramp. There was light traffic moving down the strip and the sun began to warm the air slightly, taking the steam out of our breath and making the day more comfortable. Just as we began to dig in and sip the hot coffee we put in our travel mugs, I noticed the front of a vehicle sticking haphazardly out of the cape of the ramp.\nThe cape of the ramp is open on both sides to allow the merging vehicle to get a look at oncoming traffic before pulling out. There’s a short acceleration lane built in to the right side of it that is big enough for one car to squeeze through if another car is parked right next to the wall. There, a city police cruiser was right next to the wall, leaving just enough room for one car to squeeze through. The number on top of the car verified my suspicions of the identity of its occupant, and I sighed on the inside to prepare myself for the coming hassle.\n\nOfficer Smith was a college boy who graduated from the same university I was working for and made it in to the city police. He was a bit taller than I am and significantly skinnier than the average skinny person (all bones and elbows). He ended up getting assigned to the district that encompasses our campus (much to his dismay). His superiors cited that because he knows the area, he’ll be a good resource for the University Police and could work towards improving the ties between the city police and us.\n\n His dismay of being assigned to an area he was trying to get away from was exasperated by his disdain for our small police force (he was a notorious YouTube lawyer). He questioned every stop, every move, every hard look any of us gave him during patrols and contacts. He almost landed himself in jail once or twice for some pretty brazen acts of exercising his rights, though the University decided to protect him instead with slaps on the wrist.\n\nHe was leaning out of the driver’s side with a radar gun in his hand. The short wall and bend of the exit ramp of the garage made it a good spot to pull radar for speeders rocketing on the merging ramp to catch up to traffic on the main thoroughfare. We had many complaints of speeders in that area, and during rush hour, several members of the community complained to the city that the speeders would not allow the exiting cars to merge on the ramp due to their speed and they occasionally assigned a cruiser to PSA the area.\n\nI made my way down the ramp slowly and came up behind the cruiser with Josh in tow. Smith was leaning so far out of the window that his body covered the side mirror and he was pointed away from the building to his back to catch distance on the approaching vehicles. I slid along the wall, the sound of my nylon jacket muffled by the rush of vehicles passing by and approached the back of the cruiser. I had pulled the airhorn assembly off the front of my bike (powered by a 9v battery) and held it in one hand while reaching out with the other to push the back of the cruiser. Just as I made contact with my hand, I gave it a hard shove to make the back of the cruiser bounce slightly as I hit the horn.\n\nSmith jumped and quickly turned around towards me. Due to his position, he nearly fell out of the window of the car and almost dropped the radar gun. Laughing, we hung back towards the rear of the car and allowed him time to fumble about trying to get back inside the car so he could open the door and come to the rear towards us.\n\n“I should arrest you for improper use of a signaling device.” He spat, his gums packed with what looked like an entire can of dip making his bottom chin jut out at a funny angle as if he was just punched in the face and it was swelling in to a baseball. The tobacco laden spit landed at my feet just beside my shoe and colored the white concrete dark brown. \n\n“Civil offense. Non arrestable. Spitting at an officer is APO, though. That IS arrestable.” I grinned at him and did my best to look serious knowing I had backed him in to a corner. He sputtered something about jurisdiction and removed the huge wad of chew from his mouth and slapped it on to the side of the building. It stuck where it landed and the juices streamed down the side of the building about a foot off the ground.\n\n“Building and cape are University property and the roadway is adjacent, thereby making this my jurisdiction as well. What else, Smithy?” Josh was crying at this point. He was definitely putting on a show for Smith, but it was still funnier than the conversation we were having and I made it a point to thank him afterwards as Smith could have easily called his Sergeant to come down and tear us a new one.\n\nSmith looked a bit disheveled from his fight with the cruiser door and started to adjust himself. He laid a hand across his belt, resting his elbow on his gun and tucked his thumb in to the front buckle. I could tell he was getting extremely annoyed, but I didn’t let up as I didn’t want him laying around waiting to cite one of our officers for something stupid because he was bored; he gave one of our guys a seatbelt violation ticket as he was sitting in the cruiser, parked, on the side of the road, filling out paperwork. He was that type of asshole.\n\n“Whatever, man. You guys need to get lost. I’m busy…” His voice trailed as the radio crackled and a call was sent out over his mic. It was a disturbance call a few blocks away on the outskirts of our campus in the residential section and Smith quickly marked he was in the area and would take the call. Without even acknowledging us, he jumped in to the running cruiser and threw it in drive, skidding the tires as he peeled out of his position. Gravel and dirt kicked up from behind the cruiser and peppered us. \n“What a dick…” Josh said. I nodded in agreement.\n\nThe rest of the morning proved uneventful, with some minor door alarms and a few lost property reports. These were common after weekends, and Sunday/Mondays were the days when students awoke to discover they lost their phone during the night time shenanigans, left their wallets at the bar, got robbed, got in to fights, discovered fresh black eyes or used condoms on their floors, etc. Day work was notoriously busy on these days. Evenings, you never knew when you could get in to something. Midnights was dead until Friday and Saturday when the drunks came out to play.\n\nI broke off from Josh around 1100 to check another dorm alarm and rode down the South-side strip near the building we were at earlier. I came to an intersection and stopped at the red, catching a quick peek around for Smith in case he was tucked away waiting for one of us to do something.\n\nOut the corner of my eye, off to my left across the street, I spotted a small boy standing on the corner. There was moderate traffic, but it wasn’t enough to block my view of him. Kid must've been two or three years old wearing a small blue backpack. I marked myself out at the corner with him and rolled up to him. He was small, fairly skinny, wearing a medium weight red Spiderman jacket that was way too light for the weather, blue jeans, and a pair of Timberland boots. Well dressed for a little guy. I looked around hoping maybe mom or dad were just not paying attention and were right down the street, a common tourist tactic with parents who have small children who can walk but not quite fast enough to keep up with awe-struck parents. No one in sight.\n\n“Fuck.” said my brain. Parenting skills kicked in as I mentally swore and not verbally. I dismounted and kneeled down beside him. I learned a long time ago to establish rapport with kids and sick people, you had to get down to their level and speak to them face to face.\n\n“Hey, buddy. Where’s your mommy at?” He turned towards me. He had been crying recently, a small amount of snot dribbling out of his nose and his eyes were rimmed with tears. \n\nI thought back to when my nephew had turned two and remembered at that age, he was just learning to formulate sentences and understood basic speech. “Cup”, “Banana”, “Up”, were common words that were beginning to associate with objects and actions. Not quite on speaking or understanding level yet. Nevertheless, the word “Mommy” instantly brought a sign of recognition across his little round face. He understood what I said and what I meant, a good sign. He then just looked around for a moment and shrugged his shoulders at me, offering no help at all to the current situation.\n\nI marked on the radio for a supervisor to respond and requested the city police to be notified for a lost child. In the middle of doing this, a perfect look-a-like of George from Seinfeld came rushing up to me. I’ll spare the gritty details, but he was wearing a t-shirt and a robe over shorts and flip-flops. Instinctively, I reached for my pepper spray, as this was the usual attire of one of the local homeless in the area whose favorite pastime was to run at officers while screaming like a banshee. I relaxed as the gentleman broke stride about twenty feet away to catch his breath. He puffed as if he just ran a marathon and stumbled up to me.\n\n“Hey officer! Just thought I’d let you know this kid had been standing out here for the better part of an hour. I was watching him to make sure, you know, no one tried to snatch him or anything…” He turned around and waved a hand towards a few townhouses nestled between our large academic building and several smaller offices across the street. The front door was left open in his haste.\n\nI had a moment, just then. A moment of me imagining taking my ASP out, or pistol whipping this guy with every ounce of strength in my body for not calling the police sooner. It’s one of those incredulous things I’m sure all of you have encountered before. Just had to vent that moment to you guys…\n\nBefore I went to jump in Mr. Concerned Citizen's shit for not calling the police an hour ago, I thanked him through my gritted teeth,  took the kid by the hand, and walked down the block a bit to a shelter for battered women to get him out of the cold. It's a run-down dilapidated government building on the edge of campus. It’s where victims of Domestic's and female witnesses can stay on the government’s bill till trial or they can be relocated. There's always at least one security officer on duty there and a manager, but neither were in the lobby. \n\nI marked the new location on the radio and tried to make conversation with the kid. I was banking on the kid possibly staying here with his mother or something, as it was common to sometimes see kids or entire families staying in this building. Josh pulled up a few minutes later along with the Sergeant. We talked for a bit about possibilities and wrestled with knocking on some doors though we were technically outside of jurisdiction, but they agreed the kid might be staying in the building. Sarge went to make some phone calls while I instructed the other patrol units to keep an eye out for lost families.\n\nThe city sent us two officers and an official to our location. Smith was one of the responders, and he begrudgingly went about the task of making notifications to Missing Persons and Juvenile Services. “The real police are here. We can handle this.” Smith said to us as he walked by, cell phone working the numbers furiously. The official who responded with him was an older gentleman named Brisk, who shook his head at Smith’s back as he walked away and leaned in closer to me “You guys did a good job. Stay here. Might need you to speak with the kid since he seems to like you.” I nodded, knowing that we were in it for a long one, and turned back to the kid to chat with him a bit more.\n\nAbout an hour in to it, the manager came back from god knows where and said he recognized the kid. Turns out he was there with his mom and she was in a room on the third floor. Me and Jeff, along with Smith and the other city officer went up to make contact and got that smell that tugs at your insides a bit. \n\nWe hit the door (open and unlocked) and found her supine on the bed. Both eyes were open and her belted arm immediately told the tale: the hypodermic was on the floor amongst piles of old clothes, stale cigarettes, and general filth as were the common conditions of the run-down building.\n\nShe OD'd on heroin and had been there for a few days. No one went to check on her, no one noticed the smell, no one saw the little boy leave the room, nothing. Broke my heart to think that kid had been there in that room with his dead mom for days with little food or water and was unable to wake her up. CPS arrived on scene and helped the city cops as they took our statements and took custody of the kid. As the CPS worker gathered his few belongings and picked him up, he turned towards me, tears in his eyes. I reached out for him and touched his hand as he walked by and the walked out of the building. He never broke eye contact with me. As if I had betrayed him, my little friend with the blue backpack, he continued to look at me even after they belted him in to the small seat in the back of the CPS wagon and drove off.\n\nNever knew what happened to the poor kid but did know he had a grandmother that would take care of him since his dad was already in jail for domestic and his mom was dead. Think about it every so often so just wanted to share that one that gets me every time. \n\nThanks for reading and stay safe out there.\n",

Originally, my idea was to have this be only LEO stories. Told by the officer that experienced. However, now we're getting posts by relatives of officers, officers telling other officer's stories, and rude alongs sharing what they experienced. \n\nNow Im getting pm's on both side of the fence. Those requesting to post, and those saying they should be removed. \n\nIm a pretty relaxed mod. So, Im interested in input from the readers here. The way I see it we have a couple different options. \n\nFirst, we could have a hard fast rule of stories by officers only. 1st person stories by the person that was there so questions can be asked and answered.\n\n2nd, we could tag our posts [Officer] [Friend] [Ridealong]. That way the reader knows what they're getting in to.  \n\n3rd, we can just leave things alone. \n\nSo there you go. Let me know what you think. ",

        "text": "This past weekend, I went on a ride-along with the local dept.  It was the Saturday weekend shift.\n\nImmediately after roll call (before leaving the lot) the officer received a call for some shoplifters attempting to leave at a big chain store in the city's \"bad\" area (store is henceforth known as \"Ghettomart\").  We went over there code 2 with some other units to try and intercept the shoplifters but Ghettomart security already had them in their office for us.  So the extra units part the scene and return while the officer I was with stayed to figure out what was up.  Since the security office was so small, I stood outside so I really don't know what went on in there.  Eventually, the store employees totaled up the amount of stolen goods to be around [a lot of money].  Enough for police to get involved.  The officer would have taken two (the third was taken by another unit) of the suspects but they happen to have a child with them, so he took their information and we returned to the station for, what else, paperwork! (He did the paperwork and I watched the world cup :D ).  Anyway, during that time (which took ~4 hours) we heard another call for shoplifters at the same store that ended up running down the highway nearby.  So of course, we laughed at the guys who had to take that call.  That would come back to bite us.\n\nOnce paperwork was wrapped up, we got back in the car and the officer marked himself in service.  Dispatch had a call already and I was thinking to myself \"oh good, something exciting please?\".  Nope.  Nopenopenope.  \"Unit, we've got a call for three shoplifters at Ghettomart\".  I looked over at the officer who put his head of the steering wheel and was just sitting there silent (I was laughing).  He took the call and we went back over there code 2 (apparently they were getting rowdy, but apparently some of the store employees had said some stuff that got the shoplifters all mad or something).  When we got there, I was let into the room this time to watch.  There were three adults in the room with three children (come on, children?  really?).  However, once it was discovered they only tried stealing ~$15 of food, we were not needed.  Ghettomart ended up just banning them (as far as I know).  \n\nAfter that call, things were relatively quiet.  We ended up in this really bad area of town for a disturbance call.  Some kids were accused of breaking a window by a neighbor.  We wrap up there pretty quickly, and stay in the area for a little bit.  Shortly after, it started to smell like shit.  We both thought it was coming from outside the car so we rolled up the windows hoping it would cancel the stench.  Nope.  It only got worse.  I reached down to grab my shoe and check it (terrible idea).  I had stepped in dog shit apparently and never realized it.  So we ran back to the station to clean that off.  \n\nOnce back in service, we were called to a supposed hit-and-run (which the officer apparently really hated.  Luckily though, we roll up to discover the caller was actually a witness and neither party was around (the car that was hit and the car that ran).  So we cleared that after just taking down the witness information.  At this point, it was ~ 9pm and we headed off to find something to eat.  Before we could get anything, the officer received a call about a public disturbance.  He told dispatch to send the info.  I think you can guess where we had to go... Ghettomart!  There was a report of someone getting hostile about change at the cash register.  We pull up with another unit and attempt to sort out the situation.  That's when we get a call for shots fired.  The officer I was with looked at the other officer and said \"see ya!\" and proceeded to run back to the car.  (Woo!)  We sped to the area lights and sirens and all that good stuff only to have the call cancelled because the shots turned out to be fireworks (Still, we did get away from Ghettomart).  \n\nTo wrap up the night, we were sent to a bar near the edge of the city about a drunk man who drove away (and did not turn on headlights or whatever).  As we approach the intersection near the bar, a teenager in a nearby fast food parking lot flagged us down.  He couldn't get his car alarm to shut off.  The officer asked the teen if he shut it off and turned in on again (lol).  Just as the kid went to try that again, we heard over the radio that the drunk man was not stopping for the other unit and initiated a chase.  So while that teen was still fixing his alarm we sped out of there and attempted to catch up (that was awesome).  We got told to back off eventually since they had the suspect in custody.  Once that was called off, we turned around and headed back for the station to wrap up the night.  ",

        "text": "Waaaaaaaaaay back in my early years as an Air Force cop, our career field was divided into two groups - Law Enforcement (who manned the gates and drove standard patrol on the Mayberries that AF bases are) and Security (who guarded the aircraft/classified facilities at Garrison and did Air Base Ground Defense army like anti-terror stuff deployed). The careers are joined/mixed now. I entered the military as a Security guy.\n\nSo, it was a quiet afternoon on a weekend, and my buddy and I, who were posted for the day out walking in circles around two different airplanes, had been relieved by a 2-man mobile patrol for lunch. This meant we were to drive to the chow hall, get meals to go, and drive right back... the NCO's of the mobile patrol didn't want to be on the birds too long.\n\nNow the quickest way to the chow hall cut through housing. Suddenly the radio squawked with our dispatch announcing a violent domestic in progress, with order for nearest and all available patrols to respond. (\"Control/LED\", joint dispatch for both LE and Sec, also acted as the base 911 operator, alarm monitor and maintained the 24 hour running blotter of events). My buddy, driving, chimes in, \"hey... that right at the end of this street...\"\n\nNow... let me make note here, as I said, we were split career fields... We security cops could deal with terrorists, conduct squad level infantry actions, handle heavy weapons and explosives, etc, etc, etc... That said, we never got ANY law Enforcement training... no ticket books, no running radar, no verbal judo (real Krav Maga though), no \"how to\" on any of the myriad grey situations LEO's deal with.\n\nSo... we proceed to break just about every rule of responding to a domestic that has ever been written.\n\nI respond on the radio to Control that we are on it and arriving now (which got an rather amazed/upset response that a Security mobile patrol was there), flipped on the lights and siren and pulled up right in front of the house. We exited, taking our rifles with us (we were armed with M-16's {the original, tri-prong flash suppressor, Full-Auto, no forward assist M-16} and 120 rounds of 5.56 in a 5/1 ball/tracer format).\n\nAs we ran up the walk toward the house we could see the the screen door was closed, but the door was open, giving us a view down the entry hall of the house to the living room, where we could see a large male perp straddling a female who was screaming her head off. The male was yelling intelligibly, his left hand wrapped in her hair, beating her head up and down on the tile floor... each time he pulled her head up he was punching her in the face.\n\nMy buddy didn't stop; he ran right through the screen door, with me about two steps behind him. We used our highly practiced rifle strike drills to \"convince\" him to get off her, lay flat, and allow himself to be cuffed. As my buddy was standing him up, I turned to the female, who was curled in a ball crying, told her \"don't worry, an ambulance is on it's way, were taking this bad guy away so he can't hurt you any more.\" A quick radio call was sent to Control to let them know we had the perp in custody and were removing him to our vehicle.\n\nWe then followed our Security training... bad guy is cuffed, you run him \"out of the area\" then search prior to putting him in a vehicle for transport. Of course, we had the dual issues of A) \"now that he is in cuffs, we are responsible for his safety and security\" and B) After our \"convincing\", he was rather slow on the mobility scale.\n\nSo, as we got him out on the porch (other patrol cars pulling up nearby), my buddy goes first down the three steps built into the walkway, then turns to catch if needed. I've got the perp by his cuffs and his hair; I remember my foot touching the second stair...\n.\n\nI came to, laying in the grass next to the walkway, my head in horrible pain. I was surrounded by my buddy, 2 other cops and a EMT who had been taking my pulse and was now shining a light in my eyes... I was able to mutter something along the lines of \"whahappen??\"\n\nMy buddy, with the amusement in his voice only fellow cops might have, explained, \"Dude... she came from behind you with a rolling pin, yelled 'You ain't taking my Man!!! ', and then she home-runned your head!\"\n.\n\nTurned out, I got really lucky... she had her choice of wooden or marble rolling pins, and went with wood...\n\n\nAnd thus I learned my first Law Enforcement rule... **NEVER** trust the woman at a domestic, **NO MATTER WHAT**.\n\n\nHandily, after this incident, all of the Security cops on base started getting LEO training...\n\n.\nTL;DR - Wasn't trained, Didn't Know, Turned my back on female at a domestic and almost got killed with a rolling pin.",

        "text": "From my experiences, there’s a social hierarchy among the different shifts and jobs in police work. It’s similar to high school in that most people settle into their shift place and feel it’s the best spot out there. The midnight guys look down at the day-work guys (they don’t do any real police work), evenings guys look down on midnights shift (they do, like, four hours of real work then get to sleep) and so on.  It’s all stupid though, in the end, because police work is anything but predictable.\n\nRoll call started in an uneventful fashion. Some of us were fighting to keep our eyes open; others were nursing their coffees like they were consuming manna from heaven.  No one noticed Luke in the back until the sergeant called our attention to his presence. \n\n “Luke has transferred from mids for the school year so he can help his wife with the kids at home while she attends college. Everyone welcome him and show him how we do things on day-work.” Sarge was always way too peppy in the morning and we met his enthusiasm with grumbles and nods in the general direction of the sulking Luke. “Luke, you have anything to say? Want to talk about your skill-set and how you’ll fit in?”\n\nLuke rolled his eyes and sighed, letting his cheeks puff out with the exaggerated exhale. “Well, I don’t want to be here.” He started. “I’m going back to my old squad as soon as I can. My wife is going to owe me big.” He looked around for someone to meet his statements with dissent but instead found we were all too tired to care. “Oh, and I’ve taken a big pay cut to come here so don’t expect me to go out to lunch with you guys.” \n\nI shrugged my shoulders and turned back to the front of the room. If I didn’t think Luke was a jerk before, he was making a good attempt to win me over with that speech. Sarge wore a fake half-hearted smile but his eyes looked concerned. “Ohhh kay. Well, here’s the area assignments: area 1- Nick, area 2-Byron, area 3-Brandon, area 4-devon, area 5-Luke, area 6- EMR, area 7-Biggs, area 8- Pedro, area 9 will be Billy held over from Mids, field is Ned and station is Stan.” \n\nEveryone stood but I leaned back in my seat in despair. Not only had Sarge changed me from my usual area, but I was going to have to work next to Mr. Congeniality. Sarge pretended to organize some paperwork at the desk but called me over once everyone had exited to go load up their cruisers. “Hey, c’mere.” I obeyed and sulked over to his desk.\n\n“Try and talk to Luke. He’s a great cop and we would really like him to stay if he wants to. We just need to show him we get into the good cases too. He thinks we’re all “school crossings and mental transports.” Show him what day-work is all about.” He punched my shoulder to emphasize the last point and smiled enthusiastically awaiting my eager acceptance of the role of squad pep-rally coordinator. \n\n“Ok, whatever.” He deflated a little with my lack of returned enthusiasm, but I wasn’t feeling up to the challenge. Why fake it? I started to walk out and Sarge called to me before I made good my escape. \n\n“Oh, hey, hold on. I forgot one thing. Tell Biggs he’s got those three school crossings.” I nodded and took another step. “Oh, and tell Devon I forgot to assign the mental transports. Have him take one and tell him to pick someone else for the other.” I nodded again and took another step. “Oh, and ask Ned how long he’s going to be in court. I’ve got an afternoon assignment for him to walk some boy scouts around the station.” I nodded again and jogged out of the room. Day-work was pretty damn exciting at times. \n\nI made it to my cruiser and marked in service only to be greeted by an immediate dispatch to an alarm the midnight squad had graciously left on hold for me. To top things off, Luke was my backup. I pulled up to the house a few minutes later and filled out my false alarm notice, assuming that I’d find nothing remarkable. Luke still hadn’t arrived by the time I got out and started to walk around the house’s perimeter, making sure all the doors and windows were secure and there were no signs of foul play. As I rounded the last corner, Luke’s cruiser pulled up and he regarded me with a confused look from the driver’s seat. \n\n“Dude, what are you doing? He asked as I taped the notice to the door.\n\n“What do you mean? Putting up the false alarm notice.” I didn’t understand his confusion. \n\n\n“No, I mean why are you walking around the house on your own? And why wasn’t your gun out? There could’ve been a burglar lying in wait for you.”  He was genuinely dumbfounded by my lack of tactical approach which was foreseeable since he was a part-time member of our SWAT team. \n\n“I go to, like, ten false alarms a day. If I waited for back up and pulled my gun out for each search I’d not only waste the whole day on alarms but I’d probably also freak out some elderly residents who don’t understand how to work their alarms.” I guess they did work stuff differently on midnights. \n\n“That’s just plain dumb, dude. This is why I need to go back to my squad.” He really was making a good argument for me to side with him on the issue. “That coffee is working double time and my crap schedule is all off. I’ll be 10-200 at the station, cover my area.” He sat back in his car and was still shaking his head in disgust as he pulled away. Sarge’s assignment was going awesome.\n\nAs soon as I cleared the alarm, I was dispatched to Luke’s area for a larceny from an old folk’s home. My day kept getting better and better. I begrudgingly marked en route and arrived a few minutes later to be greeted at the front desk by a nurse. \n\n“Oh dear, did Ms. Smith call again? You’re here for the necklace, aren’t you sweety.” I told the rotund woman I was and asked if she could show me to the room. She agreed but first pulled me aside. “Ms. Smith has been … slipping?... lately. The dementia is coming on stronger of late, poor woman. She thinks someone took her diamond pendant but it’s locked away in her locker for her own good.” She explained as she keyed open Ms. Smith’s locker to show me the “missing jewelry.” \n\n“Ah, so there’s no reason for me here then?” I asked hopefully.\n\n“Well, if you could, y’know, convince her you took a report I’d be very grateful. I’ll keep your card and can show it to her if she starts with the thievery allegations again. It’d be a real swell thing if you have the time, honey-pie.” She batted chubby eyelids bedecked with false lashes in an effort to come off as coy but only succeeded in making me want to get through with the task at hand faster. \n\n“Ok, I’ll help out.” It was day-work, after-all, this is what we did. \n\nMs. Smith was a fragile looking octogenarian. She was wrapped in multiple quilts and had on a hair net when she opened the door to answer the nurse’s knock. “Well good morning Ms. Smith!” The nurse’s early morning enthusiasm rivaled the Sarge’s but she talked to the old woman like she was a two year old or a puppy, almost like she was happily surprised Ms. Smith had survived the night.\n\n“And look who I have here!” She presented me with up turned hands, Vanna White-like, if Vanna white had consumed the entire dinner course at the Sizzler.  “Here’s an officer! You know you shouldn’t be calling 9-1-1 from your room Ms. Smith!” She mock-scolded the old woman and shook her finger at her in a playful manner. Ms. Smith and I both regarded the nurse with confused, critical expressions. \n\n“Ah, officer, thank gawd!” Ms. Smith had a thick New York accent and she still talked as much with her hands as with words. Her wrists flapped around as she continued. “The service here is atrocious and…” she paused and glanced conspiratorially around, “I think they are stealing from me.” There no was need to whisper as she did, Nurse Marie Calendar was close enough to make out what she had said and her bright, toothy smiled dimmed a bit. \n\n“Well, I’m here.” I broke the awkward silence caused by Ms. Smith’s allegations. “What’s missing?” I dutifully flipped open my notebook and began scribbling. The next twenty minutes or so went like a NASCAR race; we circled endlessly from topic to topic and back again. The description of the chain led to the type of clasp, led to the description of the pendant, led to the style and cut of the jewel, took a side track to discuss her dearly departed husband, led to her good-for-nothing daughter-in-law, led to the description of the chain. By the third lap I was ready to end my charade. I was relieved when the radio crackled and I excused myself to listen.\n\n“Ummm, Zebra four ninety. I think there’s shots being fired?” It was the voice of a notoriously lazy officer from the shift opposite of mine. She had earned her reputation shortly after being denied a school liaison position and had decided she would do her best to avoid all work like the plague. She was working a secondary job and, like the rest of her police skills, her radio traffic was terrible. \n\n“Zebra four ninety – did you say shots fired?” Asked the confused dispatcher. \n\n“Y-yes? I think there’s a unit across the street shooting.” She couldn’t have sounded more confused if she tried. The subject matter she was reporting seemed as mundane and run-of-the-mill as marking out on a traffic stop. \n\n\n***Continues in comments (10000 characters isn't nearly enough, amiright?)***",

        "text": "I’m going to profile some of the more notable “clients” I worked with over the years. Two of the three were homeless (I guess interesting personalities sometimes go hand-in-hand with homelessness?) and the third was just a maniac. \n\nFelix was an enigma. Some days he’d be the kindest, most respectful person you’d ever meet. Others, he’d be the first to spit at you as you walked past and threaten to kick your ass when you turned to confront him. He had a permanent scowl (from a severe beating he took but refused to point out his assailant) and a terrible limp (from being hit by a car). He bore his scars with pride and on a good day would talk as long as you’d listen about where each one came from. He was epileptic and diabetic – both conditions exacerbated by his inability to turn down any offer of malt liquor. His favorite brand was “Cobra” which was only stocked by one store in the region – a little bodega on the outskirts of a largely Hispanic slum zone. \n\nFelix appeared to be Hispanic himself, at first glance, but he couldn’t speak a lick of his neighbor’s native tongue. In fact, Felix rather despised those who lived in the towering apartments around him, often getting into fights with the day laborers who waited for work on the same turf Felix panhandled for beer money. The former Navy vet was a staunch proponent of immigration reform. He made no friends during the annual ICE round-ups, standing on the curb as the white, government owned van, filled to the brim with illegal immigrants, slowly made its way out of the barrio, chanting “USA, USA!” as he pumped his fist in the air. \n\nThe closest thing Felix had to friends were a group of black homeless guys that stayed in the area to pry into the day labor work their Hispanic counterparts dominated. The term “friend” is used lightly though (as will become clearer later in the story) and I’m pretty sure it was one of them that beat Felix to within an inch of death, permanently disfiguring his face.\n\nOne of my best friends, Greg, once got into a scuffle with Felix while arresting him for disorderly conduct. The drunken Felix had been cursing and throwing bottles at passing cars and Greg was left no choice but to take him into custody. His back up, a waifish female rookie, apparently enraged Felix with her mere presence and he decided he would assert his machismo by trying to assault her. Greg was having none of it. He tackled Felix and the two wrestled on the ground while the rookie tried to grab a hand and apply the cuffs. Eventually they got his hands secured and he was stood up and restrained against the back of a cruiser so his pockets could be turned out in preparation of arrival at the jail. As Greg pressed against Felix, he noticed a warm sensation creeping down his thigh which was pressed against Felix’s backside. Felix’s low chuckle confirmed he had just pissed himself on purpose and Greg was forced to make a quick trip to the station for a wardrobe change. Felix was that guy. \n\nOne morning I was driving along when I noticed a group of guys standing on a corner not usually used for day labor. They were all staring at a mound of what appeared to be dirty clothes, sitting in the middle of the right lane of a heavily trafficked three lane road. I pulled up and made my way through the crowd, shaking my head in an exaggerated expression of annoyance that I had to be the one to clear the obstacle. The pile of clothes turned out to be Felix: he had suffered a seizure just as he was trying to cross the road and collapsed in a convulsing heap. The gaggle of onlookers had such malcontent towards him, they gathered for the show, the thought of helping the destitute man never entering their minds. I pulled Felix from the street and into the shade of a nearby tree. He awoke a few minutes later and was irate. \n\n“Get yer hands offa’ me!” He growled up at me, still not recovered enough to regain full use of his arms. \n\n“Jesus, Felix. You’re going to get killed out here, either from a seizure or from cooking in your clothes. It’s, like, ninety degrees. Why do you have all those layers on?” I backed off, giving him space. He had on at least three shirts, all long sleeved, and a few pairs of pants. He also had on the fluffy, red, thermal vest that had become his trademark. \n\n“Because I’m cold, you idiot. If I didn’t wear them all, these Spanish feller’s would take ‘em, the thieving bastards.” He had regained the strength to prop himself up on his elbows and glared angrily at the departing day laborers. \n\n“I don’t think anyone wants your dirty clothes Felix.” I knew my presence would not be tolerated much longer but wanted one more poke of the bear before I left. \n\n“Well, I don’t want your help, asshole.” His hacked up, phlegm-filled, gob of spit came well short of me but I took it as my cue to exit. \n\nSoon after his collapse in the road (which was hardly momentous, multiple officers had saved Felix’s life in the same manner), a stray dog took a liking to Felix. I have no idea why – at first Felix swore at the thing more often than he fed it. The two became inseparable though and I shoed away the animal control officer working the beat on a few occasions, explaining Felix seemed more even tempered and thus better for the community with his pet. I don’t recall what he named the mongrel, but Felix showed affection for him openly. He even bought him a tag at the nearby pet store, a remarkable feat for a guy who only saw cash as potential beer. Every once in a while I’d bring him a pull tab can of fancy dog food and Felix was appreciative for it. \n\nI was working early one morning when I rolled up on Felix curled into a ball on the corner of two neighborhood roads. I got out to check on him, thinking he may be suffering another seizure but when I got near I found something much worse. Felix was crying over the curled up body of his dog. I squatted down just outside hitting distance in case he was in the mood to fight and quietly called his name. He looked up at me, his one eye swollen shut from a recent fight, the other dripping a river of tears. \n\n“Sunovabitch ran him over. He ran him over and took off like a coward.” He looked out into the busy road, the apparent escape route of the dog killer. We sat silently for a few minutes before I called for animal control to come take the body away for Felix. He kept the tag and wore it on a cheap chain around his neck.\n\nOne morning, close to Christmas, Jim and Nick were sent to a trespass call in one of the laundry rooms of the barrio apartments. The maintenance man had found a homeless person sleeping in the large subterranean room, a common occurrence during the winter months as the dryers provided enough residual heat to take the edge off the biting cold. When they arrived, they saw that ubiquitous red thermal vest. \n\n“Damn it, Felix! You’re not supposed to be on this property. I banned you last week!” Nick yelled from across the room. Felix didn’t stir. As Jim approached, he noticed four empty tall boys of Cobra malt liquor on the ground, a fifth still unopened on the plastic six-pack ring. \n\n“Wake up Felix.” Jim said, angry he’d now have to take the man to jail. The sheriffs had recently imposed a special “Felix Rule” where they’d refuse him for medical reasons based on his history alone. Jim knew it was going to be an ordeal. \n\nNick expanded his baton and poked Felix. “Get up, man! Time to go!!” Still no response. Neither officer wanted to go hands on with him for fear of transmitted some noxious substance onto their clothing. Felix always smelled of stale beer and body odor. \n\n“This is crazy.” Jim said, fed up with the lack of respect to his authority. He made to roll Felix over by nudging him with his boot. Felix’s entire body, stiff with rigor, lifted from the ground and slid away, falling back with an odd thud.\n\nThe two cops stared at the corpse. “Aw, crap.” Jim muttered. \n\nI arrived a few minutes later, summoned from the task force I had been assigned to assist in locating a next of kin. Nick and Jim had recounted the story of their discovery to me while crime scene techs went about the business of documenting the scene. We were all silently contemplating the loss of the unofficial mascot of drunkard, homeless, epileptics when another of our friends, Bobby, pulled up and asked from his cruiser window if we needed anything. We told him we were fine and Jim broke the news of the death along with how they found him.\n\nBobby seemed surprised and at a loss for words, shaking his head and looking up the road out his windshield before turning back to us. “Well,” he began, “you know what they say.”\n\nWe did not get what he was implying and shook our heads to indicate such.\n\n“Felix navi-dead.” He sang before peeling out of the parking lot, laughing like a maniac. We were in awe of his nearly perfect CSI opening line that played off the local population’s favorite holiday song.\n\nNot a minute later, an eruption of obscenity rose from the laundry room. An irate crime scene detective came stomping up, cursing with the skill of a sailor who just found his brother sleeping with his wife. “It’s my God-dammed last effing week! This was supposed to be a typical effing DOA sunovabitch! Not a mother-effing, God-dammed effing murder.” He stomped past, tearing off his jacket and hurling it to the ground like a tantrum throwing first-grader. \n\n“A what?” Jim’s luck had taken a full trip around the spectrum. He started at a long day in the ER getting an angry drunk medically cleared, then departed for a basic report on a natural DOA, and now looked like it was about to rebound to a long day maintaining a murder scene. He looked as though he’d be ill.\n\n“A mother-effing MURDER!” the veins on the crime scene detectives neck bulged as he spat the answer to Jim’s question at him. “He’s got three God-dammed holes stabbed in his mother effing back!” He spun around and stomped to the door to his truck, angrily dialing his cell phone for his supervisor. \n\nWe all took turns standing in the cold awaiting the arrival of homicide and maintaining the crime scene log. When they arrived, they asked us for any potential leads we might know since we worked the area. I immediately thought of the group of black homeless guys and told the detectives as much. They asked me to go hunt them down.\n\nI found the group around the block, sitting in a clearing in the middle of a hedge separating two apartment complexes. Jim and Byron backed me up on the stop and we quickly realized the group was more contemptuous than usual. \n\n“Why are you harassing us?” One of them yelled at me from the stump he was sitting on. “We didn’t do anything.” \n\n“I know you didn’t but I have a few questions. Where did you guys sleep last night?” The man I directed the question to was taken aback and looked to his companions for help. \n\n“Uhhh… we slept where we always do. Why do you care?” His surprise conceded to contempt again. \n\n“Oh, just looking into something that happened last night. Felix said you guys might know something about it.” I bluffed.\n\nThe man’s eyes got wide but this time he made sure not to look to his friends. They were all pretending not to hear our conversation, silently making themselves busy inspecting their fingernails or the debris at their feet. “Is… Is Felix ok?” He asked.\n\nI found the question interesting because, for all they knew, Felix was at his morning appointment to drunkenly curse at day laborers up the street. “Sure he is. Why? When did you last see him?”\n\nThe man was still hesitant to answer and he looked around for inspiration to grant him an answer truthful enough to get me off his back. “We saw him before he went to sleep. We were drinking over by the 7-11.”\n\n“What time?” I was going to paint him into a corner, knowing the autopsy would give us an approximate time of death. \n\n“Oh, like, eleven thirty or so. He was real drunk, didn’t seem to be feeling too good. Had a bad cough or something.” All the contempt over our “harassment” had miraculously dissolved into a cooperative, if not hesitant, answering of my questions.\n\n“Ok, well. I’m going to have some detectives come over to us and ask you a few more questions. You have any weapons on you?” The man stood and lifted his hands to invite me to do a pat down. In his jacket pocket I pulled out a Cobra malt liquor tall boy can. Gotcha.\n\nThe detectives did eventually talk to the group, but almost immediately dismissed them as suspects. I still haven’t gotten a clear answer as to why they discounted them and believe the suspects know much more than they told us that morning. A few years later, I saw one of them in another neighborhood (they moved on immediately following the murder of Felix) and I approached him to ask how his life was going before transitioning into Felix. What had started as a congenial conversation quickly devolved into a verbal tirade in which I was labeled a racist and a bully. He stormed off before I could attempt to gather more information. \n\nThis case still sticks with me and I hope I have the opportunity to be around for its resolution before I retire. I can still see Felix, angrily glaring at day labors in his red thermal vest in the hot August air. I hope to put him to rest.\n",

        "text": "Like most of my stories, this one starts while working a foot beat in one of the derelict neighborhoods of my former patrol area.\n\nI was a member of a new team developed to target the 10% of the population that did 90% of the crime. The team consisted of me, Biggs, Moose, and Amanda, and we had just cleared a subject stop on several gang members when the area unit was dispatched to a suspicious noise complaint call in the general area we were working. Moose jumped on the radio to advise we would handle it and was met shortly afterwards on a side channel by the guy who was initially dispatched. \n\n“Thanks guys, but I think I can handle my own patrol area. You keep doing whatever it is you’re doing.”\n\nMoose’s face turned red with a boiling rage but I urged him to let it go, it was only a suspicious noise call. I reasoned we could find another evil-doer while Mr. Cocky took care of the mundane call for service and was right – we soon found another person in need of our attention. \n\nHalf distracted with keeping an eye on our surroundings, I made mental note as the area unit cleared the call as unfounded, telling dispatch there was nothing in the area and he didn’t hear anything unusual. I made a guess he didn’t even exit his cruiser, probably just rolled down his window as he sped by the address – super-effective community policing, that is. \n\nAfter releasing out latest arrestee on a summons, we continued our patrol. Moose was still reeling from getting called out over the radio and made the decision for our group to head to the area of the earlier noise complaint – hopefully to find more than Mr. Cocky had on his “thorough” investigation. A short walk later and we arrived to find nothing out of the ordinary. It was getting late and a couple of us were complaining about being hungry in a semicircle in front of the apartment building when we heard it. \n\nSNAP-WHIIIIZ\n\n“What the hell was that?” Amanda scanned the area nervously. \n\n“Probably that suspicious noise Mr. Cocky didn’t find. “ Moose said as he too scanned the buildings and thin tree line around us.\n\n“It sounded like-“ Biggs was interrupted by another SNAP-WHIIIIZ, this time the trailing “whiiiz” passed right over our heads. \n\nWe dove for cover between two cars. “Shots fired, Elm and Oak. Get us some more units here!” Moose yelled into his shoulder mic. “Biggs, EMR, figure out where that came from. Amanda, keep an eye on our six. We all had instinctively pulled our weapons but there was no target to cover down on. We were stuck in a parking lot located in a low valley between several looming apartment buildings. The brick walls had played tricks with the sound but I made a quick guess that the shots were fired from the building where the earlier complaint had been called in from. \n\nI poked my head above the driver’s window enough to take in the front of the building through the windshield, two layers of angled automotive glass serving as cover. I saw a dark figure run into the building and up a flight of stairs. The person paused to look out the window on the terrace then hurried into the apartment to the left of the window. All the lights were quickly turned off and I called out to the others what I had seen as the kitchen drapes were slowly parted and the window opened, leaving a six inch gap into the dark interior of the apartment. \n\nMoose took my reports and again made the executive decision. “Cover down on that apartment. Amanda and I are going to run to a better vantage so we’re not all sitting here in the same spot.” I took the order but realized the seventy-five yard shot would be near impossible to make with anything approaching accuracy. I got down in a low prone position, using the curb under the front of the car as a rest to get my elevation correct before giving Moose and Amanda the go-sign. They quickly sprinted away from the building, leap-frogging each other from car to car before making another dash to the cars lining the street in front of the building and each taking up a cover position behind their chosen vehicles. \n\n“That was definitely a gun shot.” Biggs, a former Marine, told me as I still stared at the apartment with the open window. “Sounded like a small caliber. That last one was definitely aimed at us.”\n\nSirens approached and the radio was filled with overlapping chatter from incoming patrol units. Moose told them to shut down the roads leading up to our position and we would hold the interior scene until we had enough units to relieve us. \n\nThe sun was setting behind me, bathing the building in an almost tranquil orange light. People were still filing home from work and other apartments were already host to oblivious occupants, going about their nightly duties. “This is crazy.” I told Biggs. \n\n“I know, right?” He noticed a man approaching our position on foot, a day laborer by the looks of him, who hadn’t notice the two cowering cops with drawn guns squatting behind the Toyota Corolla right in front of him. He was totally enthralled by the loud conversation he was having with the person on the other end of his cell phone. \n\nBiggs yelled to him. “Hey! HEY! Don’t come over here. Someone’s shooting a gun!” He then pointed his left index finger and flexed his thumb in a mock pistol while making “Pew-Pew-Pew” noises, foregoing any attempt to speak Spanish in favor of the crude sign language of \"Cops and Robbers\" playing youth across the world. The man’s eyes grew wide and he slowly dropped his phone to his side. He took in the picture we presented – four cops, guns drawn and looking angry, one of whom had just pointed to him and made the ‘I’m-going-to-shoot-you’ gesture. He exploded into a full sprint across the lawn of the target building, looking back at us over his should and hoping we wouldn’t dare shoot him in the back. \n\n“No, NO NOOOO!” Biggs yelled, but there was nothing he could do to stop the runner. \n\nMoose tried his own, loud “HEY!” That went ignored as well. The man arrived safely inside the landing but didn’t slow his pace until he entered his fourth story apartment. \n\nWe all stared in disbelief. “Smoooooth.” Amanda quipped over the side band channel. \n\nWe went back to covering the building in shifts, making sure not to make threatening gestures to anyone else who ventured into our perimeter. SWAT was being spun up and our watch commander had told us to hold tight until they came to retrieve us. \n\n“Well, this is going to be a long one.” Biggs reclined against the car, crossing his legs and shaking his head with the absurdity of our situation. \n\n“Not that long, right?” I tried to come across as optimistic but I fear it may have escaped with an air of sarcasm. SWAT was notorious for taking hours to act and I too realized we were in for the long haul. “Here, take my spot, I’m gonna call my wife.” I had looked around and not seen anyone approaching so it was as good a time as any.\n\nShe answered on the third ring with a groggy, “Hello?” Clearly she had been asleep.\n\n“Hey, baby. What’s up?” I started out, lightly.\n\n“I was sleeping.” I could hear the heaviness in her voice that told me she’d soon return to slumber when I was done bugging her. \n\n“Oh, sorry. So… everything good at home?” \n\nShe sighed and then answered, “Yeah. The kids went down no problem. I was watching TV but dozed off. You doing ok?”\n\n“Oh, yeah. Nothing crazy. Biggs and I are stuck behind a car waiting on SWAT to come get us in their tank-thing. I think we got shot at.” I grimaced as I braced for impact.\n\n“Oh, wow. That’s crazy... You think you’ll be home on time?” Phew! She took that extremely well, better than I had hoped.\n\n“Uhhh… yeah. I guess. I’ll send a text if I’ll be later than an hour or two, ok?”\n\n“Ok baby. Sounds good. Love you!” \n\n“Love you too!” She hung up after my reciprocated expression of affection. I then turned to Biggs. “Wow. I thought she’d be upset or something.”\n\nHe just shrugged his shoulders and kept staring at the target window. \n\nA few hours later SWAT arrived in their BearCat armored vehicle. Biggs and I joined Moose and Amanda behind it as it slowly made its way at a comfortable walking pace to a distant point of cover where we could finally stretch out and formulate our next plan. We met the watch commander there. \n\nHe sent us off to write a search warrant using the probable cause I had observed to meet the standard needed to issue it. A couple hours later, signed warrant in hand, we returned and SWAT made entry. It turns out the occupant of the apartment had been standing out front waiting on a phone call when he heard the shots erupt from the side of the building. He had fled his country years before due to a civil war and fell into a state of shell shock upon hearing gunfire again. He was so worried he’d be the next target he ran to his apartment and turned out the lights to hide. \n\nI apologized in earnest but he agreed he would have seemed suspicious to anyone watching him. He did validate Biggs’s theory about a small caliber round, saying he could recognize by report alone, the caliber of almost any gun.\n\nA search of the perimeter by Mr. Cocky turned up some old, spent firecrackers. They had obviously been there some time, deteriorated and weather-worn as they were, but it was all the evidence he needed to make the assumption we had been mistaken from the get-go. \n\nAfter debriefing with SWAT we made our way to the station to turn it in. As we walked in to the report room, we discovered someone's attempt at a joke: On the white board, someone had draw crude firecrackers exploding surrounded by several stick figures hiding behind cars. Their guns were drawn and their hands covered their ears. Each stick figure had a fearful frown and their eyes were all drawn like crude triangles (&gt;&lt;), clenched in fear. Each also had a puddle of yellow spreading from their crotch. \n\nMoose almost tore the board from the wall but eventually collapsed into a chair underneath our likenesses, as much in disgust of one of our co-workers as for exhaustion. \n\nAbout a week later we were contacted by one of our intelligence detectives. An informant had come forward and gave the harrowing tale that occurred at a party he had attended. He said a gang member whose supplier had been arrested by police the day before offered a hundred bucks and a gun to a drunken party-goer in return for him shooting a cop. He popped off a round to prove the gun was real then handed it over to the accepting accomplice. The party goer had leveled the gun at a passing cruiser but not fired any rounds. He was still lying in wait when a group of cops approached on foot and he fired upon them from the side of the building before running to the back and jumping the fence. \n\nIt was nice to be vindicated, but I still hold a grudge towards the anonymous station Michelangelo.\n",

        "text": "Like /u/El_Mono_Rojo I prefer to get out of my vehicle and walk on foot.  A few weeks before Christmas, Jim (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/27pi4z/the_right_place/) and I were on foot patrol in a commercial district. The weather was beginning to get cold but we decided to throw on our jackets and look for shoplifters and make contact with store managers and owners. Basically, we enjoyed community policing and getting in a bit of exercise. /u/El_Mono_Rojo had a few years more on than most of the squad and was an informal leader. The group of young guys looked up to EMR because most of the senior officers were checked out. EMR encouraged us to get out and walk and we would often come up with competitions, like drinking nine beers in an hour (off duty) or getting in the most foot chases. Jim, a former college athlete, and I liked working together and had been in a few foot chases over the years. Jim is and was much faster than me, but I never give up and I can run long distances, just not quickly. \n\nThe challenge for that weekend had something to do with most foot chases in a weekend and felony arrests. While we were bull shitting about a recent prank on our Marine squad mate Nick, Jim noticed a running SUV in the middle of the lot with the windows down. We were across the lot from the vehicle but my nose could smell the sweet sticky icky of Mary Jane from across the way.  We decided to approach the car and speak with the occupants. At the time, Super Troopers was a very popular movie.\n\n“Meow Sir, Do you know why I am talking to you today” I said with a straight face.\n\n“Uhhhhhhhh, no” Responded the pale, red eyed teenager.\n\n“Littering and…Littering and smoking the reefer” Jim retorted. \n\n“No officer, no we are just hot and rolled down the windows to get fresh air, you can search the car.” \n\nAt this point we had the two teens step out of the car. We separated and began to interview them. Jim and I knew this was likely a minor offense but we thought it was a good opportunity to take advantage of the prisoner’s dilemma and practice our interview skills.  \n\nEventually the kids admitted to marijuana being in the car and we located a small amount of marijuana. Both these kids were juveniles and respectful.  Jim and I had the kids sit back in the car and decided to have a side bar.\n\n“These kids were cool and it’s just a small amount of marijuana.”  I knew where Jim was going with this.\n\n“I agree and I don’t really feel like dealing with all the juvenile paperwork today. We have better things to do.”\n“Okay, but we can’t let them drive. If they smash into a bus full of nuns we will be SOL.” Jim and I were trying to figure out a way to cut these kids a break and to protect the public. We have a bit of discretion in placing charges for minor offenses and how we resolve the situation. I am sure Reddit thinks a minor marijuana offense is bullshit and a waste of resources. I am not here to debate the politics in legalization.  The private beliefs of many officers may surprise you. However, we have a job to do and ultimately that is to serve and protect the public. In many cases not charging someone in cases like this can mean more work.\n\n“How bout we call their father and have him take custody and make sure they don’t drive?”\n\n“I like it”\n\nJim called the father and we learned he was a local high school teacher and wrestling coach.  Their father showed up about twenty minutes later. We explained the situation to the father and our concern about them driving. He completely agreed. He agreed a bit too much.\n\nThis mountain of a man and seasoned wrestler grabbed his sons by their ears and dragged them over to our cruiser.\n\n“Do you have anything you want to tell these two heroes?” \n\n“We’re not heroes, this isn’t necessary.” Jim muttered. I began to wonder if we made the right decision. Jesus, it was only a dime bag.\n\nThe two sheepish boys responded “We’re sorry sir, this won’t happen again, can we clean your cruiser?”\n\n“That’s not necessary just be careful and don’t ruin your future over a stupid mistake.”\n\n“5Adam75, are you available for a robbery in progress in your area?” Our radios chimed.\n\n“We gotta go, sir!” The father heard our radio traffic and made his way back to the car with the two boys in tow. \n\nWe responded to the dispatcher and got a lookout for a robbery at a local shop about a hundred yards from our position.  The dispatcher gave a description and said he was armed. \n\nWe ran towards the store and a gangly meth head came bursting through the door. We were about fifty yards away at this point and standing between him and freedom. He was holding a knife and booking it across the parking lot. \nWe yelled for him to stop and marked in pursuit on the radio.  The meth head began to shed his clothing and hurdle shopping carts and cars. Jim began to pull away from me and close the distance. I hopped over the hood of a car, a la TJ Hooker. It was amazing, mostly because 9 out of 10 times I would fall on my face if I attempted the maneuver. I heard a woman scream and a man say something about it looking like an episode of Cops. It was strange because time seemed to slow down.\n\nI heard a car's tires screeching and I assumed back up was getting close. I could taste the justice we were about to dole out. The robber was still ahead of us but Jim was closing and I was not too far behind. I saw a car moving in my peripheral vision. The engine was roaring and it was on a path to intercept the suspect. YES!\n\nThe car screeched to a halt in front of the fast moving suspect. He ran into the hood of the car and flipped over it at full speed. To my surprise the father of the two kids we just let go was driving. He was pumping his fist in the air and yelling “JUSTICE”. His two baked sons were sitting in the back seat with their hands on their heads and in an utter state of disbelief. I imagine being involved in a police chase while baked is an interesting experience.\n\nThe gangly meth head (think Jonah from Veep) recovered quickly and ran into traffic in the middle of a busy road. Out of nowhere Nick did his best Terry Tate impression and laid the guy out. We all jumped on the suspect and handcuffed him.  \n\nNick, ever the observer, remarked, “I think he shit himself.”\n\nIn between heavy breaths, I took in a deep whiff, “Yep, Nick, you knocked the shit out of him.”\n\n“Meow, do you know why we tackled you today.”\n\n\"Hey EMR, I think we won this weekend\"",

        "text": "Two within 24 hours! I'll take a short break and try to get another up by the weekend.\n_____________\n\nLike I mentioned before, I’m a huge fan of ditching the cruiser in favor of hoofing it around your beat. Not only does it give you the tactical advantage of sneaking up on ne’er do wells on foot, it also allows an officer to get out and meet the people – the reason the job exists. The best thing about foot patrol is you never know when you’ll walk into the right place at the right time.\n\nJim, Rob, and I were just wrapping up a group walk of a rough neighborhood in our patrol area. It was a hot day and we were all thirsty so obviously we were talking beer. \n\nJim, ever the competitor, had just made an outrageous claim. “I know I can drink more than you two donkeys.”\n\nI was cut to the core. “Are you kidding me?!? You’re what, a hundred and sixty pounds on a cheat day? I’ve got sixty pounds on you. Not to mention you’re half Asian. You can’t metabolize alcohol well enough to get anywhere close to me and my Western European blood.”\n\n“Whatever, dude. All I know is I crushed all the guys in my frat.” Jim was firm in his beliefs, even when confronted with science. \n\nRob didn’t miss the chance to pick up on Jim’s verbal flub. “I *bet* you crushed all the dudes in your frat.” His homosexual innuendo was met with an eye roll from Jim. \n\nJim upped the ante. “I bet I can drink nine beers in an hour.”\n\nRob and I looked at each other, and then burst out laughing. “No way!” Rob declared. \n\n“I know *you* can’t,” I added, “but maybe *I* could. Actually, I think I have before.” I contemplated my previous party nights until I noticed a car driving in our direction. As it traveled down the crowded street which wove between the apartment buildings in the complex, bells started going off in my head. I recognized this car.\n\n“Heh, look at this car coming up. Isn’t that like the one Stan took the stolen report for this morning?” Stan’s lookout had been notable only due to the overly-thorough nature of it, typical of any Stan radio broadcast. I know I had been annoyed by it earlier in the morning but was, at least now that I was seeing the fruit of his efforts, for once glad for Stan’s anal tendencies. His description included the make, model, year, and the very detailed wrap on the car which identified it as belonging to the small fleet owned by a local auto parts company.\n\n“No chance,” Jim laughed, “That would be horseshoe-up-your-ass kind of luck.”\n\n“I don’t know.” Rob said, trying to get a better look at the car which was still several hundred feet away. “It’s the same model.”\n\n“I’m going to flag it down. I’m about to recover a stolen car!” I did a little jig for Rob and Jim’s amusement, not too confident in my claim but curious enough to follow up on a hunch. My two partners waited on the sidewalk while I stepped out into the roadway from between two cars, hand raised in an indication for the driver to stop and a smile on my face. \n\nThe driver looked like he had just seen Bigfoot preparing to hurl a boulder at him from the roadway: shock and horror. He jerked the car over the double yellow line and gunned the accelerator, rocketing past and missing me by inches.\n\n“Holy crap!” I yelled. “It’s him!!” Instinctively, maybe stupidly, I sprinted after the car, leaving my friends in a cloud of confusion behind me. \n\nThe car careened into an intersection controlled by a four way stop sign pattern. It attempted a hard left, wheels screaming in protest, and slammed into a vehicle that hadn’t noticed the oncoming maniac. I picked up my pace which had begun to slow due to the realization I was a coyote to his stolen car’s roadrunner. The door of the stolen car burst open and the thief stumbled out, regaining his composure long enough to see me bearing down on him, T-1000 style, half a block away. He took off on foot, running in the direction he had intended to turn his now disabled car. \n\nI lost sight of him almost immediately due to an apartment building blocking my view. Rather than run around to the front and follow his exact path, my High School football instincts kicked in and I made a left behind the building in an attempt to intercept him. I hurdled a short wooden fence and spun around some kids, Barry Sanders-esque, who were playing on the sidewalk as I approached the break in the buildings. Either my gamble would pay off or I had totally lost my quarry with my improvised course. \n\nJust as I crossed the point where I could make out the grassy void between the buildings, the bandit came hurtling into view. He was oblivious to my presence and, adrenaline pumping full force, I left my feet and blind-sided the fleeing felon, knocking us both to the ground and sliding to a stop with the left over momentum. \n\nHe immediately began fighting and attempted to break my bear hug around his waist. We wrestled on the ground and tumbled over each other. I noticed a crowd forming a loose circle around us and the bad guy began pleading for help in Spanish. \n\nNo way, man. This was my neighborhood, these were my people. I scanned the crowd for a familiar face and noticed a day laborer I had recently assisted in a civil dispute over back pay from his contractor employer. \n\n“Ayudame!” I yelled to him while jerking my slipping arm away from the chomping teeth of the would-be biter. \n\nThe day laborer snapped from his astonished trance and scurried over to me. He tried to pry the bad-guy’s now clenched fist away from his chest to help me get the cuffs on but the assailant made to bite him as well. Bad move. Clearly Mr. Day Laborer had been keeping up with his fùtbol skills. He took a step back, lined up his sights, and made a running penalty kick attempt right in the guy’s solar plexus, knocking the wind out of him as well as his will to fight. I quickly spun around and cuffed him as he gasped for air. \n\nOut of breath, dripping sweat, and uniform disheveled, I rose and thanked my tag team partner graciously. I could hear Jim and Rob’s sirens circling the block and that reminded me to tell dispatch and my backup where I was and that I was ok. A few minutes of confused radio chatter (“No, not that playground, the one off Elm Street!”) they finally tracked me down. I had regained composure and stood triumphantly over my prize as Jim and Rob came trotting up.\n\n“Did you just go into a foot pursuit… of a car?” Rob was astounded as he helped Jim pick up the detainee. \n\n“Guess so. Whoops.” I smiled. \n\n“Well, I guess you get to take him then. He’s not going in my cruiser.” Jim drew my attention to the guy’s pants and the large, wet stain that was slowly spreading from his crotch. “And, by the smell, I’d guess he filled up the back side too.”\n\n“Crap.” I said. \n\n“Literally.” Jim added.\n\nI ended up booking the guy for stealing the car, the felony hit and run (the old man he crashed into was injured but not seriously), and resisting arrest. He ended up getting deported after a way too long trial where I was given the opportunity to testify to my pursuit skills on several occasions.\n\nA couple weeks later we had a squad party at my house. I made it to eight and a half beers – a full three beers better than Jim - before I puked all over my newly re-finished hardwood floors. I guess we can’t all be winners all the time.\n",

        "text": "Brace yourselves, this is another rough ride. I lost my whole Sunday brooding over this. I think I finally hit the emotional points I was trying to convey and don't want to wait until tomorrow to post since I might second guess myself. Originally I titled this The Birth, but this new title seems more appropriate. - EMR\n\n___________________\n\nI tried to cultivate informants early in my career. It was a clumsy affair; I had to give out my personal cell phone number (I wasn’t assigned one since I only worked patrol), could never really compensate the informant (no access to CI funds), and had yet to be exposed to many of the depravities I’d witness later in life. In short, it was like trying to paddle up stream with a colander. Sure I made progress, but the amount of effort I put into it was hardly worth it. I did learn a lot about dealing with people and their emotions. It was rough going, but I persevered.\n\nI had met Angela on a gang stop. She was seventeen, and trying to get in with the local MS13 clique to fill the void left by her mother kicking her out of the house. She had been living on the streets or squatting in gang dens for several weeks when I met her, and she was full of spite towards authority. It made sense knowing the predominant authority figure in her life had abandoned her. I learned later she never knew her dad, had been molested by one of her mom’s boyfriends at age thirteen, and had begun to abuse drugs and alcohol at fourteen. One of the MS13 members I found her with was wanted for an attempted murder in another state – a testament to how far her life had spiraled out of control. \n\nI ended up taking her to the juvenile jail (against her curse filled protests) so the system could figure out what to do with her for the last four months of her legal childhood. After dropping her off and shaking the icky feeling she had instilled with her verbal barrage of hate, I quickly moved on with my duties and forgot all about her in a short time. \n\nSeveral months later, while getting a coffee at the local 7-11, I ran into her again. She was mopping the floor and not paying attention to the goings on around her. I had the feeling you get when you recognize someone but aren’t sure they’ll remember you. My inner voice contemplated, “Should I go say hi? Or will she still despise me for locking her up.” I opted to quickly make my purchase and exit as surreptitiously as possible. My plan was foiled, however, when I went to open the door to exit and she crossed my path.\n\n“Aren’t you the officer that locked me up?” She asked, studying my face. I couldn’t read her exact feelings toward me and was worried a slap might be forthcoming so I hesitated a moment before confirming her suspicion. \n\n“Uh… yes, yes I am. Angela, right?” I had remembered her name but her name tag would have helped me out if I hadn’t. “How are you getting along?” I tried to keep it light.\n\nShe sighed and looked away before responding to my nicety. “Oh, fine, I guess. I got out after a month. Met a roommate inside though. I turned eighteen last month so I got this job and now I’m paying rent on an apartment up the street.” She didn’t make eye-contact while she filled me in on her life. \n\n“Good for you. Avoiding those MS guys now?” I still couldn’t tell if she hated me or just was tolerating my awkward presence. \n\n“Oh, yeah. That was so stupid. Those guys are all assholes.” She looked up to me then. “Y’know, I didn’t even know how bad they were. If you hadn’t locked me up, I might be dead now. Or at least raped or something.” I could tell she was attempting to apologize but relieved her of the burden.\n\n“Ah, it was nothing. Sorry I had to lock you up. I’m glad you’re making good with your life.” I smiled and nodded and was about to attempt another escape when I remembered the informant thing. “Oh, by the way. You’re working here now, and living nearby. Here’s my card with my number. Call me if you see anyone that needs locking up. Maybe I can help you out if you ever get in trouble with the Po-Po gain.” I passed her a card and she accepted it with a smile.\n\n“Will do!” She then went back to mopping and I made my way to my cruiser and quickly moved on with my duties, forgetting about her.\n\nSeveral weeks passed before I received a call on my cell phone from a number I didn’t recognize. I answered with apprehension – at that point I never knew who might be calling for what emergency I needed to fix. It turned out to be Angela.\n\n“Hey, Officer. Do you remember me?” I told her of course I did and asked what was up.\n\n“Well, there’s these guys. They’re slinging dope in my building and I’m worried they’re going to bring some more trouble. I don’t want to expose my baby to that.”\n\n“Baby? You had a kid?” I was astounded because the last time I had seen her she didn’t look eight months pregnant.\n\nShe laughed, “No, no. But I’m three months along. I guess I can tell people now.”\n\n“Well, congrats?” I didn’t know if I should be happy for her or concerned she was bringing another life into her chaotic world. \n\n“Thanks! The daddy’s going to move down here when the baby comes. I’m so excited.” The call quickly turned from an informant call to an impromptu chit-chat session. \n\n“Cool!” I tried to sound enthusiastic. “So, anyway. These drug dealers?” \n\nAngela went on to provide info on several street level cases. She never wanted anything in return; just seemed happy to have someone in a position to help that would actually listen to her. \n\nAngela's calls stopped in correspondence to the arrival of her baby. A short time of getting back into the routine of the job and I forgot her again.\n\nWeeks later I was working a quiet morning. My wife and I had been arguing about something petty and we both finally hung up on each other in frustration. It wasn’t the best place to be mentally when you’re trying to find bad guys but hey, that’s life. My computer beeped the annoying tone I heard in my nightmares, indicating I was being sent to a call. The dispatch read the event over the radio so I wouldn’t have to.\n\n“3Bravo40, start for a service to the fire department. Caller advised his child is unresponsive, rescue is en route, requests PD presence per the LOI.” The LOI, of location of interest, had an entry for the building, saying it was rife with gang and drug activity. I recognized it as I pulled up as Angela’s building.\n\nAs I made my way up the stairs, my intuition began to cause my stomach to drop. I pushed open the door to reveal the EMTs performing CPR on the baby. It was surreal, all these giant adults looming over the tiny infant, seeming to impose violent acts on her in an effort to save her life. I was pulled aside by one of the EMT supervisors. \n\n“The dad is there.” He pointed inconspicuously at the father who was in a corner, bearing a worried expression and nervously pinching his lips while he took in the scene. “You’re going to want to keep an eye on him. I don’t think this is going to turn out well. “\n\nI went over to the man and made an attempt to gauge his emotions via some conversation about the event. “Hey, man.” I got his attention and introduced myself. \n\n“Oh, hi. I don’t know what happened. She was crying and then she just stopped. Is she gonna be ok?” He seemed concerned and shifted his gaze back to the life saving efforts of the EMTs. \n\n“I don’t know. Was she sick? Coughing or wheezing or anything?” I asked, trying to get his attention back.\n\n“No.” He didn’t offer any more information or look back to me. \n\nI made my way to a side room to call my supervisor. I needed someone there to help me out two-fold: one, for the scene – this had potential to be an investigations call out - and two, support - baby cases were the worst. He agreed and said he and Devon would be en route to me. I turned to approach the dad again but he was missing from his corner.\n\n“Anyone see where dad went?” I asked the EMT supervisor. He said he hadn’t noticed and went back to helping his guys. I checked the other rooms and couldn’t find him. That’s when I noticed a picture. It was crudely tacked to the wall and was obviously taken in the hospital. The subjects were the clinging-to-life child and, shockingly, Angela.\n\nI got on the radio. “3Bravo40, I just had a subject flee the scene. Have some more units start this way.” I then provided a look-out and ran to the window to see if I could observe the father from that vantage point. \n\nDevon and the Lt arrived and I was tasked with aiding in locating the father. The EMTs had loaded the child up at that point but informed us they had lost vitals again. They were doubtful the girl would make it. I let them pass and watched the lifeless, tiny body get carried away to the elevator. Then I ran for the stairs. I beat the EMTs down to the lobby and made it out to my car. I had been the only cop to see the missing dad so I had the best shot of recognizing him. I made my way to the nearby shopping center and spotted him almost immediately. My gut was telling me he was fleeing the scene of a murder. \n\n\n***Concluded in Comments***",

        "text": "After leaving the detective ranks, I was promoted to Sergeant. I was immediately assigned to a busy station on the midnight shift with an excellent Lieutenant.  At first it seemed hardly like a promotion because I lost a lot of detective perks and was stuck working the overnight shift.  I also was out of my comfort zone and away from my friends. Luckily I had a good crew and station. /u/El_Mono_Rojo did a great job describing the LT in this story: http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/23lzrg/you_robbed_the_wrong_guy/\n \nHe is the type of guy you would follow into a shitty situation without any hesitation or doubt. He is a born leader, great cop and goes out of his way to make sure the officers working for him are rewarded for good work and treated fairly. In many ways he is a mentor for me and /u/El_Mono_Rojo.\n \nOne fall evening around three in the morning we noticed a call on hold from another police agency from a more rural jurisdiction. The information in the call was unclear but it seemed that the other agency had a lead on a fugitive wanted on a double homicide. The fugitive had been wanted for over a decade and they had information he was at a location in our station's patrol area.\n \nSomehow this was treated as a routine call and placed in the dispatch call cue along with barking dogs and parking complaints. Typically, information like this would be passed from investigate entity to investigative entity so that we could get legal and safety information clarified and develop a plan. Calling a civilian dispatcher and saying “Hey there is a wanted murderer in apartment X, go check it out” is bad form and dangerous. This is a type of call that needs follow up and analysis. Just sending some poor midnight officer to knock on a door in the middle of the night is not safe and shows a lack of respect for the receiving agency.\n \nThe Lieutenant sees the call and sets up a plan. He has me call the agency back and get the story while he set up a tactical surveillance plan. I called the rural agency and learned that they got a tip a day earlier from a federal agency that specializes in apprehending fugitives. The case was a gang drive by and the suspect was an Asian male.  The feds explained that they had reason to believe the suspect was at a particular house and requested that the rural agency aid in the apprehension. Well, this rural county is less diverse and they just grabbed the first Asian guy they saw walking towards the house. Turns out it was a relative of the suspect. They interviewed the relatives and learned that the suspect may have been in our jurisdiction.  Then just to add icing to the cake, they let everyone go and didn’t tell anyone about the lead until HOURS later. Their poor planning created an emergency for us.\n \n LT had guys watching the place and it didn’t take long to figure out the place was empty.  LT and I set up at a command post, AKA a place for the bosses to figure out a plan and drink coffee. I used some of my detective skills and figured out two cars the suspect was likely driving. Lon, an officer on the squad with great computer skills, but horrible interpersonal skills helped me out. He started giving lookouts to the region for the two vehicles and we began to work up a background on the suspect and his family. Doing this at three in the morning can be difficult and Lon is very good at that type of work.  Lon is not the guy I would call in to talk his way out of a situation or give a tour to a group of cub scouts but if I need some quick record checks, he is the guy.\n \nWhile Lon and I were buried in computer checks, LT asked for the tag of one of the cars. After repeating the tag to LT, without an ounce of excitement in his voice, he said the car just drove by the command post. I told him to stop bullshitting and I got back to work. He repeated his observation and told me to look up. Sure enough it was circling the post.  We rushed to our cars and stopped the vehicle. Inside we found two female relatives of the suspect. We also found a bag full of male clothes, fresh from the store and two burner phones.\n \nAt this point I requested the assistance of certain technological devices to help narrow down the suspect’s location.  Sure enough we narrowed it down to a large apartment complex area. Lon found the other car outside the apartment and we shifted our surveillance team. We also called in the federal agency assigned to locate fugitives. As this was their case and lead they took over command when they got to the scene. \n \nWe all worked out a plan together and agreed to attempt entry into the apartment once the suspect was observed at the location. We wanted to strike before the suspect knew we were on to him and under the cover of darkness.  The group stacked up in anticipation of an entry and the rest of us set up a perimeter. The anticipation was exaggerated by the fact that only emergency traffic was allowed on the radio during this process.\n \nA few minutes into radio silence I heard Russ get on the radio. Russ is not the brightest bulb and Mono’s story of Russ does a good job of capturing his personality. http://www.reddit.com/r/elmonorojo/comments/26iypi/the_deer/\n \nRuss explained that he had a situation unrelated to the fugitive on the perimeter but needed help. LT ran over to Russ who was set up in the complex next to a high rise. He found Russ in a state of confusion and disbelief. Russ explained that he heard a loud pitched whistling and looked up only to see a large women heading towards the ground at a high speed.  She had decided that today was the day to end it and took a swan dive off her balcony 20 stories up and almost landed on a cop hidden in the bushes.\n \nLT said he would handle the body and for me to stay on the fugitive. The fugitive opened up the door and was surprised to see a group of LEOs in tactical gear ready to grab him. \n \nAfter the apprehension, I asked LT what happened. He laughed and said he put a sheet over the body and had the EMTs sneak through the perimeter to confirm her death. This was a tremendous feat as firemen never travel anywhere without an entourage of vehicles with sirens blaring and shutting down every road in sight.\n \n \nIt was a good capture but I was brought back to missing the detective ranks later that shift. The commander chewed us out for an hour because he would have called SWAT.",

        "text": "This one's less cop specific but if I ever write a TV show about my exploits, it will definitely be an episode. It's also a welcome to my good buddy /u/DetectiveBrandon who is a new contributor here in /r/talesfromthesquadcar and the main character in \"The Peach.\" I'll get back to some juicy \"being a cop\" exclusive stories in my next post. - EMR\n\n__________________________\n\n\n\nPrior to my arrival in the investigations section, my good friends Brandon and John had begun working on a string of car thefts where the thieves were targeting a specific group of vehicles that were not commonly stolen. A combination of good detective work and some serious good luck eventually concluded with them identifying the culprits. They discovered a group of guys that worked across multiple state lines to steal vehicles and clone them – that is, they’d alter the identifiers of the stolen cars with legitimate information – and then sell or export the pilfered vehicles.  I arrived just when things were really heating up in the investigation. \n\nA Lo-Jack equipped vehicle stolen from our jurisdiction was located a good five hour drive from where it was taken, across the border of a neighboring state. After much begging and pleading on Brandon’s part, the locals there eventually decided to dig a little bit and discovered a huge warehouse in the vicinity of the recovered car filled to the brim with stolen cars and car parts. We would need to go down there to assist, an idea that was sure to be dashed by the financial woes our jurisdiction was experiencing at the time. We knew we’d have to approach the task of being granted permission in a strategic way. \n\nOur direct supervisor wasn’t much help, claiming if it was up to him, we’d be digging through the warehouse at that moment. It was the commander, he told us, who really needed convincing. Christina, we’ll call her, had been in charge of our section for a couple years. She had vaulted through the ranks and arrived to her throne to rule over the fifty or so detectives below her with a MBA rolled up in one fist and An Idiot’s Guide to Management shoved firmly beneath her rump, giving her a high perch to stare down on us peons. Early on, she began managing the group more like a tyrannical IT manager than high ranking cop – she changed the dress code, messed with schedules to “optimize production”, and invented arbitrary rules concerning overtime and other general police functions that had gone unchanged for decades. Needless to say she wasn’t well received. \n\nOne day, Christina was making the rounds to see how her troops were carrying on without her eager-to-micromanage direct scrutiny. She came into our section right after Brandon, John, and I had just finished a heated debate concerning our preparations for the Zombie Apocalypse. John was adamant he’d be able to shoot-and-loot his way to success whereas Brandon and I were positive the ‘bunker down and protect your resources’ plan was the best strategy. It had ended abruptly on John’s insistence Brandon and I were a couple of hopeless nerds and Brandon took the dig hard, resigned to quietly sit at his desk and close some cases he had solved earlier in the week. Christina approached him, cat-like, and startled him with her enthusiasm.\n\n“Ooh! A peach! Is it peach season already?” She had spied the peach, a remnant of his packed lunch, sitting on Brandon’s desk and used it to shoehorn her way into a conversation. “I love fresh peaches.”\n\nBrandon was clearly taken aback. He had an inherent fear of authority already, but that combined with the fact this specific authority figure was so detested by his peers made any interactions with her prickly at best. “Oh, hi boss. I didn’t see you.”\n\n“Well, here I am.” She fingered through some of his files, feigning interest for a moment. “Are you going to eat that?” \n\nBrandon was dumbstruck. “Uhh, the peach? N-no. I’m n-not going to eat it… would you like it?” He picked it up and offered to it to her, his fingers straight so she wouldn’t bite them off.\n\n“Why thank you! You’re so generous!” She maintained eye contact with him as she took a too-big bite from the robust fruit, its juices dripping down her chin in protest. “Oh gosh, I’m such a mess.” She giggled as she wiped her mouth. She bid Brandon farewell as she turned and left.\n\nHe stood up meerkat-like and watched her walk away. “Guys!” He hissed to John and I. “Guys! Did you see that?”\n\n“I heard it, but couldn’t bring myself to watch. Was that as awkward looking as it sounded?” I asked a slack-jawed Brandon. \n\n“Holy crap, guys, that was crazy.” Brandon slowly lowered himself into his seat and stared blankly at his computer screen, trying to process what had just occurred. \n\nJohn piped up, ever the charmer. “She wants your D, Peachy.” Instantly Brandon had been donned a new nickname. \n\nThe next day, Brandon came rushing to his cubicle, sweaty and still wearing his workout clothes. \n\n“You two are not going to believe this.” He began. I couldn’t help but note the strange blend of shock and amusement in his expression. “It happened again.”\n\n“What did? Did you crap yourself again?” John posed flippantly from his cube, still typing away at a report he was working on.\n\n“No, that only happens when I’m really drunk. It was Christina. She was in the workout room.” John took notice then, joining Brandon and I in our gossip huddle. \n\n“Go on.” John urged, realizing with a fox-like smile that another moment to cause Brandon some humiliation was at hand.\n\n“I was getting off the treadmill, about to grab some free weights when she called me over to her. She had been stretching on the floor, doing some crazy yoga pose, and she asked if I could help her.”\n\nJohn’s grin widened and his eyes began to sparkle at the picture in his mind’s eye.\n\n“She said she needed someone to push down on her back, she wasn’t getting a deep enough stretch.” Brandon added, now looking away in a thousand yard stare as though the ordeal had been traumatizing. \n\n“And? Did you?” John’s lips were pulled thin across his face as he asked. \n\n“Well, yeah. I mean, she’s my boss. I kinda have to, right?” Brandon perused the mental HR manual in his head. \n\nJohn leaned back and shook his head in disbelief. “She’s all over you man. She’s a cougar on the hunt and you’re her poor little victim fawn. Ha!”\n\n“Dude, I’m married… and no. No way! I wouldn’t even consider it! She’s married, she’s my boss, she’s… her, y’know.” Brandon looked victimized as he pushed the mere idea of any kind of illicit relationship with her out of his mind. \n\n“You may need to do it,” John jabbed, while returning to his seat, “for the team. For your big case! We have a warehouse to search, Peachy, and it’s not getting any fresher down there.”\n\nBrandon looked around dejectedly for any sympathy to his plight. “Well, I mean, she obviously likes you, man.” My attempt to calm his nerves didn’t go over well and Brandon announced in a huff he needed to go shower. \n\nJohn called after him. “Be sure to put on fresh underwear, Peachy! You never know what’s going to happen later on. “\n\nBrandon replied with an extended middle finger held high in the air.\n\nOver the next few days we toiled in vain for any possible way to assure we would get to make the trip to the warehouse. We knew we’d discover a ton of evidence to help our case and Brandon had already briefed a federal prosecutor who seemed interested in taking it on. The clincher was a phone call from one of the local detectives down by the warehouse. He informed Brandon they had executed their search warrant and recovered another ten cars. He said there was too much to go over every last piece and his guys still didn’t have a full grasp on what “cloning a car” really meant, or even how it was a crime. Brandon realized if the case was going to be worked right, we were the ones who had to do the dirty work. He left the office with an aura of duty and returned a half an hour later.\n\n“What’s in the bag?” John asked, Se7en-like, as Brandon made his way to this desk. \n\n“Oh this? Nothing really. Just our ticket to warehouse-town.” He reached in and pulled out a large ripe, peach. “Wish me luck boys.” He added as he walked off into the sunset (or elevator lobby at least). John and I stood in a speechless awe as he walked away. Our champion.\n\nChristina was delighted with Brandon’s offering and immediately granted his request for the three of us to make the trip on the department’s dime. On the evening of our second day of inventorying the warehouse, after recovering another twenty or so stolen cars that would have been lost if not for our efforts, we sat in a bar. I bought Brandon a beer and thanked him for his sacrifice that led to our trip. \n\n“Aw, it was nothing.” He modestly sidestepped my praise. “I just gave her a peach. I think she’s lonely, no one likes her in the section.”\n\n“That’s how it starts,” John threw in, “you feel bad for them, they pay for a trip, next thing you know you’ll be smoking a Newport menthol in bed wondering how you got there.”\n\nBrandon rolled his eyes. “Never. I promise, I’ll never use my sexiness to further my career. Although,” The six beers prior to the one he was currently drinking showed themselves in Brandon’s new inability to prevent the spilling of too much information, “she did mention ‘seeing me in the workout room when I got back.’… Huh.\" He pondered, \"Strange, right?” \n",

        "text": "My aversion to working traffic details and obeying the All-Powerful Dispatcher made the plan to aim my career in the direction of detective work very obvious. After a few stints working in criminal-oriented specialty positions, I took the process for and was accepted into the Investigation Section. \n\nMy first stint was alongside many of my buddies in the property wing. There, cases of felony property crime – anything from credit card fraud to car theft – were investigated. It was the typical kicking off point for most detectives and a place to cut your teeth in detective work. \n\nI was assigned to a squad with Brandon, one of my best friends from the old patrol squad. Although he had less time on than I did, he had arrived in the Section several months before me and was happy to show me the ropes. He was enthusiastic about the job and especially interested in the technical cases, specifically those concerning auto thefts. He’d happily snatch up new car cases and was always eager to be on the cutting edge of theft prevention. \n\nAbout a month into my new job, Brandon approached me to ask if I’d like to sit in on an interview with a guy who was reporting his rental car stolen. On its face, it didn’t seem too unusual, but when he added, with a sly grin, the fact he was “positive the guy was making a false report” I was swayed to join him.\n\nWe met the “victim” in the lobby of our building and made our introductions during the elevator ride up to the interview room. The “victim” was a military man, stationed at one of the local bases and decked out in his fatigues. He was very courteous and didn’t strike me immediately as someone who would lie to police.\n\nWe sat down in the interview room, Brandon having already brought in a bottle of water for our guest, and began.\n\n“I’ve read the report and talked to the officer who wrote it but why don’t you run me through exactly what happened the day your car went missing?” From the start, Brandon was avoiding any verbiage associating with a legitimate theft. The man began his account, matching the narrative on the preliminary report:\n\nHe parked his car at a store in a busy commercial area and went in for some shopping. When he came out two hours later, his car was gone. He waited at the store to see if security had video of the theft and to see if the local tow-companies called in a fresh pick-up but had no luck on either count. He eventually called the police and here we were. \n\nBrandon took notes and nodded along to the version of events as presented by the man. He asked a few clarifying questions – Was there anyone suspicious in the area? Any other businesses checked for video? Were there any missing keys to the car? – and wrote all the innocuous replies on his legal pad. He then put the pad down and rubbed the bridge of his nose, his eyes squeezed shut with frustration. \n\n“Who would want to steal a rental car?” He asked, his eyes still shut and fingers still massaging away an exaggerated headache.\n\n“Huh? Oh, I don’t know.” The man was taken aback at the sudden change of social temperature in the room. \n\n“No one, that’s who. No one wants to steal a 2007 Ford Fusion with damage to the rear bumper and one hundred and twenty eight thousand miles.” He had looked up to the still surprised man to answer his own question. There followed an awkward silence while the two stared at each other; one with a confused expression, the other bearing one of annoyance.\n\n“If you’re saying I did something with the car, you’re crazy.” The man finally broke the silence. “What would I get out of saying my rental car was stolen?” He was genuinely curious, by the look of him, and I had to admit I couldn’t think of any good answer.\n\n“I’m not sure.” Brandon said flatly. “What I do know is that that specific car had a factory installed ignition immobilizer on it. All the keys are accounted for and unless you wanted to drop the two hundred plus dollars to have a new key made, there’s no way it was driven from the lot.”\n\n“What about a tow truck?” The man countered, now becoming agitated with the way the interview was progressing. \n\n“I’ve called the companies that work that area: no one has any matching cars on their lot.” Brandon forehanded back.\n\n“Doesn’t mean the tow truck wasn’t working alone. It could’ve been a guy with a truck.” Quick volley by the accused.\n\n“Again, who steals an un-drivable, 2007, damaged, high mileage Ford Fusion?” Drop shot by Brandon.\n\n“A thief!” The man stood up to emphasize his point. \n \n\nBrandon slowed down the match, shaking his head and chuckling to himself. “You know what I think?’ He pitched the ball into the air. “I think you were drinking at the bar across the street from where you called the cops.” The wind up. “I think you crashed it while drunk and got rid of it. You hid it somewhere to save your ass from the fees from the rental agency as well as any criminal charges from us!” Brandon rose from his seat as well, celebrating his ace.\n\nThe man became red-faced and his brow furrowed deeper than a Jack Handey quote. “I guarantee this car was stolen. If you prove otherwise, I’ll plead guilty to whatever BS charge you drop on me.” He almost spit the promise.\n\n“And if I recover it in possession of some dim-witted car thief, I’ll call you up personally to apologize.” Brandon replied calmly, diffusing the situation. “But that’s not going to happen.” He had trouble leaving good enough alone.\n\nThe mad straightened his camo blouse and breathed deeply. With eyes closed, refusing to meet Brandon’s gaze, he asked, “Are we done here?” \n\n“Yes. I’ll be in touch.” Brandon sat down again, pretending to review his notes as I saw the man back to the elevator.\n\nWe waited in awkward silence before the ding of the elevator marked its arrival. “If he thinks I had something to do with this theft, I’m going to prove him wrong.” The door closed before I could reply. \n\nBrandon was waiting, all smiles when I went back to the interview room. “Well, how was it?” \n\nI pondered for a moment. “Rough?”\n\n“Whatever, man. That car is next to impossible to steal without a key. He dug his own grave by insisting he had all the keys accounted for.” He walked back to his desk, content with the outcome.\n\nA few uneventful days passed. I was sitting at my desk one afternoon when Brandon’s phone rang. He picked up and I could hear his half of the conversation.\n\n“It was?’ He sounded excited. “Where?”… “No, that’s where it was stolen from.”… “Are you sure?”… “Well that doesn’t make sense. Take a picture and send it to me.”\n\nHe hung up the phone and looked over our shared cubicle wall. “That was Smith – he recovered GI Joe’s car. It’s in the same parking lot where he reported it missing. Either our guy returned it or the dude who took the report did a real crappy job of checking the lot.” His phone chimed the arrival of his picture message and he quickly reviewed it. “Sonuva!”\n\nI stood to see what caused his reaction. The picture was of a 2007 For Fusion with damage to the rear bumper. The windshield was littered with flyers and pamphlets, the types passed out to advertise new gyms or discounted auto insurance. Judging by the amount, the car had been parked there for some time. \n\nBrandon eventually made the phone call to the “victim”. I use quotation marks there because the only thing he was a victim of was a bad memory. It turns out he had parked his car at one door of the store, done his shopping, then exited a different door. For whatever reason, he was adamant the car was parked somewhere in the lot by the second door. It explained everything – the lack of surveillance video, the non-report by the tow companies, and the lack of willing thieves in the market for a well-used 2007 Fusion. It didn’t explain the screw-up by the cop who took the report and failed to notice the car sitting in the lot on his lap – one of the most basic follow-up details when taking a stolen car case.\n\nBrandon and the “victim” apologized to each other, even offered to meet to buy the other a beer. They agreed that if they did, they’d talk a mountain trash about that first cop’s ineptitude and place the blame of the spiteful interview firmly on his shoulders.\n",

        "text": "I’ll assume it’s like this in others lines of work as well, but I know it’s true in law enforcement: your co-workers become your second family. You have your go-to person, that one individual you feel comfortable enough with to wear your heart on your sleeve and bear your soul to. Then you have the close seconds – those who you would trust your life to when the going gets tough and then laugh about it over beers at the end of your shift. There are the tertiary guys, good people but not anyone you would usually associate with in a social environment. Then you have the dregs. There are always those one or two guys who you’re just embarrassed to be associated with at all. Here’s to the dregs!\n\nIt was a damp evening in one of the months where the heat began to give way to the colder months ahead. A light drizzle had been falling all afternoon and well in to the evening and though it was still early, I was having a hard time of it staying on point with my job. The grey skies had sapped me of my energy like Superman basking in the glow of a red sun and I found myself just staring at the cars that passed my supervisor-induced radar post, not even paying attention to their speed. \n\nThe tone from my radio jolted me from my trance. I was being sent to an accident on private property, possibly with injuries. Not the most exciting calls but it beat writing tickets any day.\n\nI made my way through traffic with no urgency, accidents not being considered a priority to our bosses, and noticed the fire truck and ambulance up ahead running full bore, lights and sirens, parting the sea of irritated commuters like Moses leading his people. Then the updates started.\n\n“3Charlie40, be advised: caller states the victim may not be breathing.” Uh-oh, that’s wasn’t good. I acknowledged the update and picked up my pace slightly, using the service road to cut past some of the backed-up traffic and cutting back in when able. \n\n“3Charlie40: Caller is now stating they will be attempting CPR. Caller states there is a lot of blood.” Crap.\n\n“I’m direct.” I told my radio. I was only a few blocks away now so I figured I might as well use my lights and siren to get there quicker. \n\nI pulled up and knew something was immediately wrong. The firefighters were standing inside a circle of curious onlookers, ushering them back from a body lying prone on the asphalt, covered with a white sheet. The battalion chief walked up to brief me.\n\n“It’s pretty obvious there’s nothing we can do. We’ll stand by until you get your people here to relieve us.” He broke the bad news as we made our way through the crowd and ducked under some hastily slung fire line.\n\nHe knelt next to the body and looked up to me, sighing and nodding his head in an indication I was about to see something heavy. He lifted the sheet, revealing the old man’s face. It seemed to be flattened, depressed in the middle and twisted into a scowl of sorts. The worst part was yet to be revealed. I had assumed the gore I saw while walking up was due to the man being dragged. It wasn’t though.\n\n“The truck ran over his face, popping the side of his skull and spraying his brain matter up the way.” The chief indicated with his hand the path of brain leading down the road a dozen or so feet.\n\n“Holy crap.” I said in a low, awestruck voice. \n\n“I know, crazy right?” The chief looked up at me, almost smiling before becoming serious again. “Be careful though, his wife is right over there.” He pointed to the small hill where the victim’s wife still stood. She was definitely experiencing shock as a female EMT tended to her. She was also coated in flecks of brain matter.\n\n“Holy crap.” I said again, in a low, awestruck voice.\n\nAnother firefighter approached. “Near as I can tell, they were walking down the hill when he slipped and slid under that pick-up. His head stopped right underneath the rear tire.”\n\nThe driver of the pickup was sitting on a curb near his truck, his head in his hands and body shaking with sobs as tears rolled down his face.\n\n“Holy crap.” I concluded in a low, awestruck voice.\n\nMy backup arrived as well as a supervisor. Lt had me run the crime scene log while we awaited the arrival of our accident reconstruction unit. Nick stood near me, talking about what he had learned from the recently widowed woman before he had been relieved by a victim specialist.\n\n“Married for forty-five years, man, just heading home from some light shopping and planning dinner, then WOOSH, it’s all over. Damn, dude, this sucks.” He was taking this one hard as he gazed into the horizon.\n\n“I know, right? Life’s a bitch sometimes.” I stared down at the crime scene log on my clipboard, the drizzle continuing to dampen everyone’s spirit as much as the awful event we were working.\n\n“Oh crap, here’s comes Tommy.” Nick pointed to our hefty co-worker as he made his way through the crowd. \n\n“Pardon me, excuse me, coming through.” You could make out his overly-loud voice from twenty yards away. \n\n“He’s the last guy we need here, especially so late into it.” I was not happy to see Tommy. He was the squad clown, always looking for a quick laugh and not really taking anything serious. He also lacked both compassion and people skills.\n\n“Howdy fellers! Let me check out the gore.” Tommy spoke with the back of his hand shielding his words from the crowd. \n\n“If you come in, you have to write a supplement report.” He was senior to me in rank but I didn’t give him the respect his position would normally demand.\n\n“I know, doofus. Just write my name down and let me go.” I gave in and wrote his name on the log, stepping aside and letting him enter. \n\n“What a dummy, look at him.” Nick said as we both watched Tommy waddle into the crime scene. \n\nSuddenly Tommy’s foot shot out from under him. He landed hard on his back and tried to stand up almost immediately, only to have both his feet shoot out backwards behind him as he belly flopped onto the pavement a second time. He took his time standing up and, once on his feet, realized the full horror caused by his fall. Tommy was covered in old man brains.\n\n“Awwwww, sick! Is this… is this brains? Ewwww, Jesus Christ! I’m covered in brains!” Tommy shook his arms and pieces of gore were flung to the ground, making little splatting noise on impact. “Holy crap! It’s everywhere!”\n\nNick stepped up. “Tommy, TOMMY!” He hissed. “Shut up! That’s his wife over there!”\n\n“Aw crap! I don’t even have a clean shirt back at the station!” Tommy hadn’t heard Nick over his proclamations of disgust. Luckily, the widow hadn’t noticed his buffoonery yet. \n\nNick walked up, quickly but not so quick as to draw the attention of the victim’s wife or our Lt. “Tommy! Shut up you retard. The widow is right over there!” \n\nTommy glanced to where Nick was pointing. “Aw, nasty! She’s covered too!” The truck driver had stopped sobbing and was now taking in the spectacle with moist, blood shot eyes. Our Lt had noticed too. He left the victim’s wife, turning her gently away from the scene so the victim advocate could keep her distracted.\n\n“You: out!” He walked over to Tommy with a purpose but came just short of jamming his finger into Tommy’s carnage covered chest. “Who the hell let Tommy in? Why is he even inside the perimeter.” Oh crap.\n\n“I did.” I raised my hand like a second grader with the wrong answer to an addition problem. “Sorry, boss. He insisted. He said he’d write a supplement.”\n\nLt. took me in for a moment then looked back to Tommy, who was still whining in the background. “Ewwwww, it’s even in my hair!” \n\nHe got closer to Tommy and leaned in. “I don’t care what you do or where you go but get the hell off my scene.” He angrily growled into Tommy’s ear.\n\nTommy went wide eyed and suddenly snapped out of his episode of disgust. “Ok boss, sorry man. I’ll go to the station and get cleaned up.” He then waddled past me and out of the perimeter again, this time more penguin-like than before as he kept his arms away from his body, frozen in mid-air so as not to spread the grime any more. \n\nThe truck driver watched him walk away then shifted his gaze to me. Not thinking, I mouthed the word “Sorry” and gave him a shrug. He immediately started balling again.\n\nNick came back. “I can’t believe that guy.” He said as Tommy gently loaded himself into his cruiser a few hundred feet away. “What a complete ass.”\n\nI ended up reading Tommy’s supplement report. It made no mention of his trip and fall, or subsequent crass reaction to the circumstances. I made sure to add a line in my report to reflect it though. You know, for evidence purposes. \n\nDénouement – The widow lived in her apartment alone for another year. Nick was actually the one to recognize her during the DOA call at her place. Following the accident, she ate less and less with each passing day. Neighbors hadn’t seen her exit her apartment in months and her rarely used car was covered in tree debris and had a dry-rotted tire in the parking lot. I guess she couldn’t continue after the loss.\n",

        "text": "Allow me to preface by saying, I am not LEO. I've been with this sub since the beginning and am in total favor of being this mainly LEO written stories, but I figured this was worth the share to some of you, as it was written by a Trooper, about his partner Kallie. (I also posted this to /r/ProtectandServe ) I hope you enjoy\n\nGood girl, Kallie. Free Time.\nOn this past Thursday, May 29, 2014, I had to make the awful decision to put down my partner, K-9 Kallie. It was very sudden and unexpected. The day before, at the end of our work day, I noticed that she was uncharacteristically lethargic; she was having trouble walking, and having trouble breathing. Just a couple of hours prior to that, she was working and seemed to be fine. I rushed her down to the New England Animal Medical Center to be examined, and she was ultimately diagnosed with “Hemangiosarcoma,” a type of cancer that I have since learned is very aggressive, very metastatic, and particularly common among German Shepherd dogs. The doctors found two tumors inside of her, one attached to her spleen and one near her heart. The tumors were causing massive internal bleeding, which was causing the lethargy, and the walking and breathing difficulties. They drained the blood that had collected around her heart and that relieved the immediate dangers, but that was only a temporary solution to a very large and serious problem.\n\nOn Thursday morning, after a second doctor had reviewed Kallie’s case, the opinion was the same: she had cancer, and it was bad. Surgery and chemotherapy were options, but even the most optimistic scenarios only gave her an additional six months to live, and her quality of life during that time would have been very poor. I didn’t think I could bear to see her labor through pain and discomfort every day for six months, only to die at the end anyway. I decided it was best to just let her go, peacefully and painlessly.\n\nAfter the decision was made, I sat down on the floor next to Kallie while the doctor administered the medicine. Kallie laid down, put her head on my lap, and went to sleep, forever.\nKallie was a good dog, a working police dog for the Massachusetts State Police K-9 Unit, and she worked hard for the Commonwealth for over seven years. She had a very successful career, and I think she deserves some public recognition for a job well done.\n\nKallie and I went through Patrol School together during the spring of 2007. We certified as a Patrol Dog Team on June 14, 2007, and we certified as a Narcotics Detection Team on October 25, 2007.\n\nFor the next seven years, Kallie and I worked together every day, patrolling eastern Massachusetts and responding to any community that requested K-9 assistance, from Salisbury to Cape Cod. Kallie tracked and located missing and lost hikers in the woods, fleeing felons, domestic abusers, B&amp;E suspects, shoplifters, and various other types of missing and/or wanted people. She found people hiding in thick bushes, in high weeds, in sheds, in swamps, up on roofs, in crowded bus stations, under overturned kiddie pools in back yards, passed out in drainage ditches along the side of the highway. I went to K-9 calls very confident that if someone was there to be found, Kallie would find him (or her, in some cases).\n\nKallie was not very large for a police dog; she was a female and weighed a little more than 60 pounds. Some of our big male dogs can weigh up to 90 or even over 100 pounds. But what Kallie lacked in size, she made up for in determination: she was 100% committed to the task, every single time. When she was on a hot track, she pulled like a freight train. If I wasn’t paying attention, she could yank me right off my feet, which she did more than a few times. I’ve taken some spectacular falls while trying to keep up with her on tracks through the woods and across snow and ice. I vividly recall one track during a bitterly cold January night when I was literally snow skiing at the end of the leash while she hauled me across a frozen baseball field. Again: she was a sixty pound female; I am a 200+ pound male, plus the additional weight of all my police gear. This was one highly motivated dog.\n\nHer real talent was narcotics detection. During her 7 year career, Kallie sniffed out a total of over 30 kilos of cocaine, 6 kilos of heroin, 369 pounds of marijuana, 123 grams of methamphetamine, and her narcotics alerts contributed to the seizure of approximately $1.6 million dollars in illegal drug money. She located hidden compartments containing illegal drugs built into motor vehicles, built into bookshelves in houses, and in furniture; she located drugs hidden up in ceilings, in the engine blocks and the bumpers of cars, in the headrests of car seats, in storage containers, in suitcases, in packages being shipped through the U.S. Mail, in the pockets of clothes hanging in closets. Words cannot describe the feeling of pride and satisfaction in knowing that your dog located illegal narcotics that most likely would have been missed by humans. A bad guy drug dealer might have been allowed to walk away free, but your dog found his drugs and now he’s under arrest. No better feeling in the world.\n\nKallie was very popular at our K-9 demonstrations. Because she was very social and had such a nice, calm disposition, she was always chosen to be the “meet-and-greet” dog, the dog that all the children could pet and have their pictures taken with at the end of the demo. I don’t think Kallie particularly enjoyed this duty, having a crowd of small children jostling around trying to pet her, but rather she merely tolerated it because she knew I wanted her to. Nevertheless, she always sat still long enough for every child to have a turn to pet her, and have a picture taken. I think there must be pictures of Kallie in hundreds of family photo albums all over the Commonwealth.\n\nShe was calm and quiet at home, great with my family. My neighbors often commented on what a nice dog she was because they never heard her bark; they often forgot that we even had a dog. But when she got in the cruiser with me to go to work it was a whole different story: she was all police dog, eyes open, ears up, and she barked at everybody. I had to keep telling her to shut up so I could hear the radio transmissions. Whenever we were driving to a call with the lights and siren on, she would go bonkers in the back; she very quickly learned that the lights and siren meant that we were going somewhere to do something, and she loved to work. I never had to build up her motivation. Sometimes the challenge was getting her to calm down a little bit.\n\nIn June of 2013, I was promoted to Lieutenant and I was lucky enough to stay in the K-9 Unit as the Unit Commander. I was also a little bit unlucky, in the sense that my responsibilities transitioned from being primarily a handler to more of an administrator. This meant I had to spend more time in an office sifting through paperwork, which cut into the time that I could spend with Kallie out answering K-9 calls. I kept her as busy as I could, answering as many calls as possible and always ensuring that she got alot work done at various K-9 training days during the week.\n\nOur last work day together, Wednesday May 28, was a good day. At 10:00 am we answered a patrol call in Walpole. At 1:30 pm, we answered another patrol call in North Attleboro. At both calls, Kallie was her usual self: motivated, enthusiastic, and happy. She came out of the cruiser like a cannon ball, put her nose to the ground and went to work. It was only after all the work was finished and we were done for the day that I noticed that something was terribly wrong with her.\nBy 10:00 am the next morning, she was gone.\n\nI’d like to thank Janet, Diane and everyone at the New England Animal Medical Center in West Bridgewater for their kindness and compassion during Kallie’s final hours. They allowed me to take my wife and young boys in after hours on Wednesday night to visit Kallie one last time, to say good-bye. For that I will always be grateful.\nKallie was 9-years-old when she died. She was getting ready to retire from police work. I had been looking forward to her retirement, so she could have some time to spend as “just a dog,” to be in the house with my family. I was disappointed that she never got to experience that. However, many of my colleagues in the K-9 Unit have suggested to me that Kallie may not have enjoyed that kind of sedentary lifestyle; she was a working dog, working was what made her happy, she loved it, she lived for it. And truly: she worked, and she was happy, right to the very end.\n\nI think my colleagues are right.\n\nGood girl, Kallie. Free time.\n\nSubmitted by Lt. \n\nYou can find the post and picture of Kallie [here](https://www.facebook.com/MassStatePolice/posts/640628759354444)",

        "text": "Working with informants is usually tedious. True, if you do it well you end up making some great cases and really make a difference in the community. But for every pat on the back from your supervisor for a job well done, there are twenty annoying phone calls asking for help with some trivial “tell my girlfriend to stop seeing other men” request. \n\nI was working with a reformed gang member (we’ll call him Lopez) who was trying to get on his feet in a very impoverished neighborhood in my usual patrol area. We had yet to build a complete trust for one another but we were well on our way. He would frequently call me to drop the dime on street level dope dealers, gang members looking for a fight, and guys on the down-low trying to hide from some form of court issued paperwork or another. I would in turn get him some cash and be his personal legal advisor. We had a good thing going.\n\nOne day Lopez called me to warn me he had some heavy info in the chute. He said he met a new girl and she had lots of information on a local crack cocaine ring that I had been trying to crack for several months. I was eager for the information but he warned me he would have to call me back because his girl was finishing up in the shower and he didn’t want her to know he was working with the cops. \n\nIt just so happened I was on foot patrol in the area of his apartment. I frequented his block so it wasn’t unusual I’d be there to the rest of the community. Not wanting to blow his cover, I made an effort to motor past his building without outwardly paying attention to it. As I passed his window I saw him inside, glancing out. He made eye contact with me and his expression made it clear he was up to no good. I paid it no mind and kept walking. \n\nJust beyond his building I was flagged down by the local ice cream vendor pushing his carts and ringing the bell to summon children. We were good acquaintances and made small talk for a few minutes before I told him I had to head off and see if I could find some bad guys. Just before leaving him, he looked quizzically over my shoulder. I turned to see what he was so curious about and noticed two thick, pasty white, feminine legs edging out Lopez’ window. The ice cream vendor chuckled and pushed his cart in the opposite direction while I chose to approach on foot, curious as to why Lopez’s visitor had chosen such an unconventional exit.\n\nAs I neared the window, the female’s gut finally won its battle against the window ledge’s friction and she squirted out like a greased pig. She uttered a surprised gasp as she began the eight or so foot fall to the ground. \n\nI don’t think she could have handled the fall any more awkwardly. One leg shot out backwards and perpendicular to the ground behind her. To prevent her body from twisting forward into a face-plant, she thrust forward her arms and overcorrected by thrusting her other leg forward, doing a sort of mid-air split. The outward shooting leg caught her just as she met the ground and a sickening CRACK was audible from my viewpoint ten feet away. \n\nI rushed over to her and immediately switched into first responder mode.\n\n“Don’t move it, I’ll get you an ambulance. Does anything else hurt? What the hell were you doing? Do you need water? I’ll get a blanket.” I drowned her in questions as she rocked back and forth, eyebrows peaked in the middle in an expression of agony.\n\n“Owowowowowowowow” She repeated, mantra-like, as she attempted to keep her leg stable. Mid way down the shin it bent in an ugly angle.\n\nI summoned the ambulance and a second unit before glancing back up to the launching pad from where the girl had just taken off. Lopez was leaning out, gold crucifix dangling between the two straps of his wife-beater. His eyes were wide in shock and upon noticing me he began to apologize. \n\n“Dude, I’m sorry. I didn’t know she would fall. Don’t arrest me bro.” He whimpered.\n\n“Shut up and get her some water!” He immediately ducked back in to the apartment to do my bidding. \n\n“What’s your name?” I asked the girl. She had begun shaking even though it was 90+ degrees outside. \n\n“Mica.” She answered, though it came out in a nasally cry. I told her again no to move.\n\nLopez joined us in the grass with a coffee mug of water. “What happened?” He asked, making a poor attempt to act surprised.\n\n“You jerk!” Mica stuttered through shivers. “Why’d you tell me to jump? He wasn’t even coming in!” She was still holding her leg aloft but had shifted her attention to Lopez, boring a hole into him with hateful eyes.\n\n“I didn’t make you! You said you didn’t want to get caught!” Lopez was incensed she would accuse him of any wrong doing. \n\n“Catch her for what?” I asked Lopez. He looked back to me, realizing he had misspoken. \n\n“Uhhh… nothing?” He replied. \n\n“What would I catch you doing?” I then asked Mica.\n\nShe rolled her eyes as she looked away from Lopez to meet my gaze. “Idiot,” She muttered “I’m a runaway. I didn’t want you to make me go home.”\n\nI took her in in an attempt to evaluate her age. Lopez was pushing 25, a convicted felon trying to make a late attempt at a normal life. Anyone near his age wouldn’t be considered a “runaway”, so she had to be much younger. She peered at me over chubby, childish cheeks. Her shirt bore some cartoon cat and she was wearing cut-off jeans way too short to still be considered decent. The pink back-pack she wore had her name written across the top in black marker.\n\n“How old are you?”\n\nMica looked to Lopez then back to me. She bit her lip as she braced herself to answer. “Fourteen?” She told me as though asking what the correct answer was.\n\nSirens were approaching as I looked to Lopez, now holding his head down and scratching the close-cropped hair on his neck. “I didn’t know.” He muttered to no one in particular.\n\nThe ambulance arrived and the EMTs whisked her into the back, leaving me alone with Lopez. “That was stupid, man.” I was irate as I grilled him.\n\n“I know, I know. Dude, what was I supposed to do? Just let her wander around here? She’d be robbed and raped before it got dark!” He had a point but I still wasn’t happy. \n\n“Stay here, I’ll be back to deal with you in a second.” I stomped off to the ambulance leaving Lopez kicking the dirt and cursing himself. \n\nInside, the EMTs advised me which hospital they were destined for. I was surprised they were bypassing the closest one in favor of a level one trauma center further away and asked why they had made that decision.\n\n“Well, juveniles with broken legs that are seven months pregnant go to the better hospital.” One of them replied sarcastically.\n\nMy appalled reaction and glance back at Lopez must have been picked up by the girl. \n\n“We didn’t have sex. He offered me his shower and I needed to get clean. Please don’t arrest him – I’ll tell you about Rocko.” She was teary eyed either from pain or the enormity of the situation. My curiosity was piqued by her offer but I had a few things to get in order first and told her I’d return in a second. \n\nI met Devon outside the ambulance and gave him the run down. I called Lopez over and quickly questioned him. “Were you going to tell me about Rocko?”\n\n“Yeah, dude! That’s why I called you.” He urgently whispered, eager to get off my naughty list.\n\n I turned to Devon. “Ask Byron to ride in the ambulance. He’ll need to call her parents and tell them what happened. You and I will look into Rocko.” I then turned back to Lopez. “I’m not arresting you – for now. You owe me though.” Devon and I left the grateful former gang member behind as we returned to the Ambulance.\n\nMica began immediately. “Rocko has guns and stuff, he showed me. I think he’s 18th Street. He made me deliver silver rocks for him so I could spend the night at his apartment.” She had no other information and confirmed Rocko lived in a building on the other side of the neighborhood. He wouldn’t have seen the commotion made by her botched escape attempt. \n\nThe ambulance took off a moment later with Byron inside conducting further questioning. Devon and I made our way to Rocko’s apartment and took up a surveillance post behind a nearby building. \n\n“No foot traffic but she was adamant it was third floor, on the right, in the back.” I told Devon. “You up to try a knock-and-talk?”\n\nDevon agreed and we approached cautiously on foot, peering into windows for anyone who may be acting as a lookout. We made it into the garden style apartment building and up the staircase to the third floor. We waited just outside Rocko’s apartment, listening for any sign of life from inside. There was music playing and the sound of someone shuffling dishes on a table but no voices – maybe he was the only one home. \n\nI knocked on the door (in itself a difficult task – you have to knock innocently, not like a cop) and heard footsteps approach the door. Rocko was peering out the peephole at us. We had ducked to either side of the door, backs against the wall outside of his view. He asked, “Quien?”\n\nI looked over to Devon and made a ‘what-do-we-do?’ gesture. He just echoed it back and I knew the ball was in my court. In my best Central American, nasally Spanish impression of a local immigrant, I said, “Jose.”\n\nThere was a pause at the door then suddenly the chain was being taken off and the deadbolt thrown. Rocko opened the door and stood in the threshold, staring at us with a confused look. Clearly we weren’t Jose. \n\nI introduced myself and asked if I could enter. Still in a state of shock, he allowed us in. He was shirtless with a pair of gym shorts on so I could see he wasn’t armed, calming my biggest officer safety concern. I bluffed again, saying a neighbor had called concerned about a young girl in the apartment that looked to be in distress. He was adamant no one else was there, insisting we take a look. I stayed with him, gathering his vitals while Devon did a quick sweep. Devon returned a moment later with a Ziploc bag in his hand with several small squares of tin foil and a straight razor inside.\n\n“What’s this?” He asked brusquely. \n\nRocko played the dumb card, just shrugging his shoulders and laughing nervously. I explained to him how I’ve seen similar items used in the sale of drugs and asked if he had any narcotics in the apartment. He denied that allegation as well, again insistent we check. I tried one last trick.\n\n“This is your last chance. If we find anything, I’ll be sure to charge you with it all. If you help us out, I can help you out too.” I then let the silence linger and just stared at him expectantly as he pondered my words. \n\nYou could almost make out the argument going on between the Devil and Angel on his shoulders as he stood vacillating. Finally he looked up to me, a thin sweat formed on his forehead. He wet his lips and cleared his throat before saying, “It’s there.” And pointed to the kitchen. \n\nDevon walked over to the small kitchen. “Where?” He asked. \nRocko pointed to the sink. “There, there.” He was a broken man, ready to accept his fate. \n\nDevon reached into the drain and pulled out another Ziploc, this one with several small silver pebbles inside. Each silver pebble was an individually wrapped rock of crack cocaine with a street value of about twenty bucks each. \n\n“Thank for the honesty.” I told Rocko. “Any weapons in here? Guns, knives, hand-grenades?”\n\nHe shook his head no in a dejected fashion. “No real weapons, just a BB gun.” He pointed to a closet and sure enough, there was a CO2 Colt 1911 replica on the top shelf, though it wasn’t illegal to own. \n\nRocko ended up getting booked for possessing crack cocaine and offered an opportunity to work with our narcotics division to get rid of his charges and stay in the country. He must have accepted because I would see him from time to time walking through the neighborhood. \n\nThe next shift I worked I got a call from Lopez. “You got him!” He made it as a statement more than a question, the street having provided him the answer long before he talked to me. “Now, how much you gonna pay me?” I could picture him on the other line, rubbing his hands together greedily in anticipation of his government payout.\n\n“Well, going rate for a drug dealer is a couple hundred.” He laughed when he heard the good news. “Buuuut,” I continued, “There’s the small matter of your fines.”\n\n“Fines?” His demeanor suddenly took a turn for the worse.\n\n“There’s the fifty dollar fine for harboring a juvenile runaway; another fifty dollar fine for lying to me about her being a runaway. Then there’s the fifty dollar fine for telling her to jump out the damn window and allowing her to get hurt.” I chipped away at his nest egg.\n\n“But that’s only one-fifty.” He was quick with the math.\n\nI thought for a second before replying. “The last fifty is for her ER co-pay. You owe her that at least. I think we’re even, what about you?” \n\nLopez sighed on the other end of the phone. “Ok, man, whatever.” He was quiet a moment longer before joining me again with more enthusiasm. “I met another hot chick last night! This bitch knows every gang member in the area! I’ll be getting you some good info soon, dude.”\n\nI realized then our relationship was going to work out just fine.\n\n***Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!***\n",

        "text": "Story time. It was mid-summer and I was 19. I had just gotten off work at my valet job around midnight. Another valet and I were invited to smoke a blunt at a receptionist's house. Right on. The other valet and I had went halves on a bag of that \"legal weed\" (most people called it spice) earlier that day, but you can't beat the real thing.\n\n\nWe go over to receptionist girl's house and proceed to get baked. After a nice, long smoke we realize it's getting late and decide to go to his house to crash. I'm driving us, following all the traffic laws. We drive through our small hometown on the way to his house when I see the blue lights in my mirror. Fuck. I pull into a parking lot and roll down the window.\n\n\n\n**Cop:** License and registration.\n\n**Me:** Here you go, sir.\n\n**Cop:** Have you been drinking?\n\n**Me:** No, sir.\n\n**Cop:** Do you have any illegal drugs in the vehicle?\n\n**Me:** No, sir.\n\n**Cop:** Do you mind if I search your car?\n\n**Me:** ... Do you have a warrant? (No idea why I say this. I blame 99 Problems)\n\n**Cop:** Step out of the vehicle.\n\n**Me:** Okay.. (Fuck.)\n\n\n\nThe cop then gives me a field sobriety test. Let's just say I don't ace it. Meanwhile, another cop takes my coworker to the other side of the car and asks him some questions.\n\n\n\n**Cop:** Why did you hesitate when I asked to search your car?\n\n**Me:** Alright, you can search it if you want but it would be a waste of time.\n\n**Cop:** Wait right here.\n\n\n\nAfter a short search, he walks back over to me with the bag of spice I had cleverly hidden in my center console. Meh, it's legal.\n\n\n\n**Cop:** How much of this have you smoked tonight?\n\n**Me:** None, sir. (Which is true. Only dat blunt.)\n\n**Cop:** Don't lie to me.\n\n**Me:** ... Okay, I had a little bit. (It seems like a decent plan B)\n\n**Cop:** Yeah, a lot. Where did you get this?\n\n**Me:** The hippy store in Xtown.\n\n**Cop:** Do you know they can put stuff in this which would make it a controlled substance?\n\n**Me:** All I know is I bought it legally, sir.\n\n**Cop:** Go sit in your car.\n\n\n\nI get back in the car and ask my coworker what was said. He was asked the same questions and neither of us admitted to smoking the real stuff. After several long minutes, the cop returns to my window.\n\n\n\n**Cop:** The reason I pulled you over is because your registration light is out. Here is a warning, and here is your bag back.\n\n**Me:** Thank you, sir. (I can't believe he gave it back!)\n\n**Cop:** Just get that fixed and be careful about what you buy.\n\n**Me:** I will, sir. Thanks again.\n\n**Cop:** Have a good night.\n\n\n\nMy heart was racing with excitement. So, we went to my coworker's house and rolled a celebratory legal fatty. It was enjoyable but still, there's nothing like the real thing.",

        "text": "I apologize in advance for this more somber story. Cop work isn’t all pranks and bumbling CI’s. \n\nAfter a six month academy, my agency sends newly sworn officers to one of several district stations. There, the rookie cops join their FTI, or field training officer, and set off for the real training: a six week ride-along session with seasoned cops where the new guy is gradually exposed to more and more police responsibilities.\n\n\nI was riding with a senior cop, Pat, and things were starting off as they normally did with a new trainer. \n\n“Your dad was a real asshole in the academy.” I gripped the steering wheel tighter and just nodded with Pat’s statement. My father, a cop on the same department, had done a stint as an instructor in our academy. He was known to be a real hard ass and I had already paid the price for it multiple times over in my short career.  \n\nPat continued. “A real asshole, that’s for sure, but at least he got things done. You can respect that. You guys had it easy in the academy compared to what I had to put up with.”\n\nI was happy Pat wouldn’t be holding my dad’s transgressions over me when it came time for my evaluations. My primary had already pulled that card, giving me zeroes for my driving ability one day because I avoided a speed-bump in an empty parking lot and justifying it by saying “It’s what your dad would have wanted.”\n\nI was still learning the area and Pat was getting annoyed by my lack of internal map. “What are you doing?!? You missed the turn!” He muttered obscenities to himself and instructed me to make the next right, as it would meet up with the street I just passed. I obeyed dutifully. \n\n“Alright, here’s the turn. After this alarm we’re going to park and you’re going to take a map test.” I shuddered. Pat’s map tests were only called that because he would consult a map to ask me questions such as ‘What road intersects Main Street a block before you come to Oak Drive?’ I’d have to bumble through with no materials to guide me. I knew I was in for a rough time. \n\nI made the turn onto the large through street I had missed and topped a hill. As we crested, I noticed red tail lights off to our right in a small wooded area at the bottom of the valley the road passed through. Something was off.\n\n“What’s that?” I asked, indicating the lights to Pat. He had missed them and looked on curiously. \n\n“You’re the cop, why are you asking me.” He replied dryly. \n\nI took that as my cue to stop and investigate. As we neared, a fine waft of smoke drifted from the car and I noticed a second vehicle nearby, its headlights not functioning after the obviously violent crash that had just occurred. I threw my overheads on and jumped from the cruiser, joined quickly by Pat. We ran to the closest vehicle, a mini-van with luggage piled high on its roof. The car’s driver side was pinned against a tree and had a deep triangle bent into the passenger area. The other occupants were just coming out of their dazes as we arrived to assess the situation. \n\nA middle aged woman, sitting wedged between the dashboard and the passenger seat, began moaning. “Is… is everyone alright?” She blinked to get the bitter smelling air bag powder out of her eyes and looked around the car. I opened her door and took in the gash on her forehead. She seemed tired and unable to focus as she collapsed out the door and onto the grass. \n\nA younger female was able to open the sliding door to my left. “Wha… what happened? Mom!” She knelt and tended to the woman lying beneath me. I entered the car and checked on a male sitting in the back. He was conscious but confused as well. Then I saw the boy sitting in the seat behind the driver. \n\nHe was probably twelve or thirteen, wearing a bright yellow Pokémon shirt, and had Down’s syndrome. He was slumped to one side, eyes closed as though sleeping, and blood was dripping from his nose and ears. I felt for a pulse but couldn’t find one. I checked again and began to hear my heart beat as my vision narrowed.  Finally I felt it, the faint throb in his carotid indicating he clung to life. I dared not move of rouse him.\n\nI checked on the man in the driver’s seat, the father of the family. The left side of his face was distorted and discolored. His tongue hung out the side of his mouth and one eye was open, staring blankly into the distance. Blood seeped from his nose and was quickly soaking into his white polo shirt. His glasses had pushed into his forehead, leaving an arching gash from the frame.  They still hung loosely from one ear. I felt for a pulse and again couldn’t find one. Resolute, I tried a second, then a third time. Nothing. \n\nHe couldn’t be dead. I was here to help him. I could do it. \n\nI exited the side of the car and ran to his door, prying at its handle with all the strength I could muster. Pat was tending to the woman on the ground and had requested rescue over the radio. \n\nThe door would open. It had to. I was strong, having finished near the top of my class in the fitness categories. I could open this door and pull out this man. I could perform CPR and bring him back. I pried at it with my fingers; ragged, bent metal cutting into my fingertips, but I ignored the pain. I extended my baton and used it for leverage, shoving it into a gap in the door and bracing myself with a foot on the running board, pulling with all my might. I could get this. My baton gave way and I stumbled back, unable to catch myself. \n\nThat’s when one of the women on the other side realized the true gravity of the situation. A bone chilling wail gave me another shot of adrenaline and I went back to the door. I saw Pat holding back the younger of the two women, not allowing her to enter the car to tend to her brother or father.  Her good intentions would only cause more harm. \n\nMy ability to reason dissolved and I tried to push the car from the tree, hoping some Herculean strength would allow me to aid the helpless victims and give hope to the grieving woman. My boots slipped in the soft mud and I fell. I rested on my knees for a moment, panting and trying to come up with more energy to continue battling with the pinned car. I felt utterly useless, helpless, powerless. \n\nIt wasn’t something I had been taught in the academy, that powerless feeling. We had always been told we could do anything. You get shot? Fight through it. Outnumbered in a fight? Go to your belt for another tool. Getting tired in a foot pursuit? The guy running from you (conveniently wearing a bright red suit of added armor) would slow so you could engage him. \n\nI stood and began ramming the car with my shoulder. Again and again I pounded it with no difference made. I was about to strike it one last time when Pat’s hand grasped my shoulder, pulling me off balance. I hadn’t seen him approach; I was only focused on the task at hand. He pulled me in close and with an urgency I had never heard in his voice told me, “The other car. Tend to it – NOW.”\n\nI nodded, my body and head throbbing as I turned to obey him. Everything seemed to be taking place on a movie screen, like I wasn’t actually living it, only a casual observer to the drama. A noise indicated my radio mic was activated and a stuttering, incoherent voice urgently told dispatch we needed rescue. I didn’t even realize it was me until after the dispatch assured me they were already en route. \n\nI acted without thinking and made my way to the second car. The driver’s door was open but there wasn’t anybody in the car. I scanned the area and noticed a man standing a dozen or so feet away. He was emptying his pockets and shoving the contents into a nearby tree that had a rotten void where a branch once hung. \n\n“Hey, are you ok?” I yelled to him. Sirens approached nearby.\n\nHe turned and saw me, his eyes widening in obvious fear, before returning his attention to the tree and stuffing more frantically. I trotted to his side and when he noticed my presence he spun and blocked my view of his cache. \n\n“I said, are you ok? Is that your car?” He didn’t answer, only looked at me with the same wide-eyed fear and darted his head from side to side, obviously looking for an escape route.\n\n“What’s behind you, let me see.” I ordered. He took that as his opportunity and tried to sprint away from the wreck. I caught him quickly due to his limp, a result of the accident, and tackled him to the ground. I wrestled his hands into cuffs as he screamed.\n\n“It’s not mine! I found it. I didn’t see them coming, let me go! I didn’t do it!” Pat ran to my side as I stood him up, rescue having arrived and relieved him of his caring for the other vehicle occupants. The runner reeked of alcohol and his words were slurred. I told Pat about the tree and he paced ahead of us as we returned to the scene. Pat met us at the man’s car. \n\n“You sonuvabitch! You were hiding your God-damned weed? People are dying because of you and you were hiding your weed!?!?! You’re a scumbag!” He punched the man’s car for emphasis as much as to blow off the anger that could have led to an IA complaint. I’m surprised he didn’t break his hand.\n\n“You watch this!” Pat swept his hand over the scene as firefighters extricated the son. “You take it all in! You did this.” He was beet red and the veins bulged on his neck during the order he issued.\n\nWe stood there and I watched through a numb fog. It was surreal; the urgency with which the EMS guys worked, the clear grief they expressed upon realizing the driver was too far gone, the raw emotion poured out by the driver’s daughter and wife. The son with Down’s was loaded into an ambulance and quickly left for a nearby trauma center. The male in the back – the daughter’s boyfriend – and the wife were taken eventually as well. The daughter was the last to leave. She was physically fine and had refused emergency services. Another family member had arrived to drive her to the ER and she had to be supported as she made her way to the car, distraught with her loss. \n\n***Continued in comments***\n",

        "text": "I was asked to delve into the rich history of how I became \"a kick ass cop\" from a \"socially inept 15 year old.\" (Their words, not mine). I'm feeling chatty, so this might work out.\n\nCirca 1997. High School. Me? Hair to my shoulder blades, died auburn to purple. Big baggie (I mean homeless people taking refuge from the rain under my cuffs, baggie) pants. Usually white, with a black and silver stripe down the side. Skin tight silver shirt. Was it gay or was it raver? Wow. I cant believe I wore that. I shopped exclusively at Mr Rags. A trendy raver store. My g/f wore vinyl pants, baby doll tops, had bleach blonde hair and bright fucking red lipstick. Life was awesomely awkward. I kept my hair in front of my face in the halls. I spoke to no one. I walked quickly. Being weird, to that level, was a way of not getting fucked with. I was a \"curby.\" One of the kids that went to the curb across the street to smoke. I dind't really give a fuck about anything. I made adequate grades, because passing ment not getting fucked with by teachers. I put freshman gym off till senior year, because that ment not getting fucked with by jocks. I didn't associate with, or piss off anyone. I had no enemies, but no allies. I had...no direction. (I know, so cliche, but it all adds up in a minute)\n\nThen I took American History. And the class was boring. I sat in the back, in the corner. And I screwed off. My teacher had a bookcase full of all kinds of books. One day, while avoiding learning, Im reading the book titles. One is called Dead Men Do Tell Tales. Now, a while back, the comedy genius Steve Martin made a little movie called Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid. A movie which I always thought was hilarious. \n\nOn a side note here, I grew up in Germany, and thus missed out on a lot of American colloquialism and phrases. I had never heard dead men don't tell tales as a phrase. I mean, I get it, but no one had ever said it to me.\n\nBack from rant. So some how I get the memory of Steve Martin making me laugh, and I see this book, which may also make me laugh, and I like to laugh. Seriously! Isn't ADD awesome???\n\nSo I ask my teacher if I may borrow the book to read it. And I do. And it's amazing! The book talkes about how science is used to solve crimes.\nA side note again. CSI Miami/Las Vegas/New York/Hoboken/Big Bear Lake/New Philadelphia didn't exist yet. Forensic Friday on Court TV didnt exist yet. Fuck, Court TV didnt exist yet. Crossing Jordan, The New Detectives, The FBI Files, Forensic Files, I, Detective, Body of Evidence, Extreme Evidence, Cold Case Files, Investigative Reports, Cold Case didn't exist yet! When I was reading this, forensics was a young and blossoming science. And I was captivated. This doctor was digging up bones, looking at them and determining manner, cause, and time of death. It was fucking unreal. Forensic Anthropoligist. That's what I wanted to be.\n\nSide note. Ask my friends how I go about new interests. The answer. Head over fucking heels. I thought I'd try racquet ball once. I bought two racquets, gloves, shoes, balls, an outfit, and played every day for like 4 months. Once I thought I'd try country music. I bought 8 pairs of Wrangler, cowboy boots, button down shirts, a cowboy hat, and a 1967 Chevy pickup. That's right, a mother fuckin truck to go with my music. Tired of being single, I met a girl, got married, had a baby, bought a new truck, and a house in the suburbs within 24 months. Boh fucking yah. When I decide to do something, I fucking do it. There is no half way for me. I digress.\n\nI found my new interest. And I start to read more. I go to the library, I find every damn book on forensic science I can, and I read. I find journals (real journals, like of medicine and science, no emo-blogs), text books, case studies. I found and bought the 1976 FBI field manual to crime scene processing. And I read them all. I absorbed the knowledge through every pore of my body. I had found a purpose in my life. I found....direction.\n\nI graduated high school, and told my parents I was tired of school and wanted to take a year off. They cringed, assuming I would never return. After about 2 months I went crazy. I figured there was learning out there to be had, and I was missing it. I called the local community college. The person I talked to should be shot, because they almost caused me not to go to school. Talk to this guy, take this test, register over here, meet these requirements....blah! So fucking complicated. No! You shall not stand in my way. I have found my calling. So I order the college catalogue, read it cover to cover, and find out that I can register for classes via telephone. And I do.\n\nI start going to college. Now I have torn jeans, t-shirts, bleached spikey hair with blue tips, and a couple tattoos. Still not standard cop material. And I learn something disheartening. Forensic Anthropologists are Doctors. Fuck. I don't want to be a doctor. Im dedicated to the cause, but I also got a real short attention span. I cant be in school for 10 years. But the bright side....starting on the west coast, there are civilian crime scene techs. No longer are detectives and officers processing their scenes, they have forensic knaves to do it for them. \n\nHmmmmm. I say to myself \"self, that sounds pretty good.\" So I start taking classes, and more classes, and more. I take 19 hours a semester, finish in 2 1/2 years, with 3 Associate Degrees. (No one told me three AAS's dont equal one Masters. My bad) Through my last year, I apply everywhere I can think of. Then I get a call from the agency I work for now. Interview? Next week? Sure! Oh, wait, FUCK! I have a fucking blue mohawk! That wont fly. So off to Sally's Beauty for some supplies. First, I cut it down, then bleach it. And it was white. Crazy doctor from Back to the Future white. Then I get some mouse brown with just a hint of auburn in it. We dye it, rinse, and.....DORITO ORANGE! Holy crap, only the red hues took. My head went from Dorito, to Cheeto, to Yellow. Looked like my head was on fire. Damn, seriously, the BEST color job I ever had. Only lasted 2 hours though, cause mouse brown went right over it again. \n\nI tested, and got hired. I graduated from college on a Friday, and started my new job as a crime scene tech on Monday. Some times you get lucky.\n\nAfter that it was a natural progression. I am what is clinically diagnosed as a \"shit magnet.\" Bad stuff finds me. And after chasing the 3rd or 4th suspect in my foresic van, my boss said \"Knock that shit off! You can't chase people without a gun.\" So I said \"Gimme a gun.\" \n\nAfter three years of Forensic work I tested and promoted to officer. I met my wife, who I guess wasn't my wife at the time, and said on our first date \"Look, I'm gonna be a cop. If that's cool with you we can go out again. If not, I had a great time.\" We married 15 months later, 2 months after I graduated the academy.\n\nSo, I guess I owe my current position to unmedicated Attention Deficit Disorder, Steve Martin, William R. Maples, and a lot of support from a lot of good people who helped me stay pointed in the right direction. Because shit, now I can steal a Dodge Neon or Saturn in under a minute. I've devised 50 ways to rob a bank or steal an ATM. I figure say it's a good thing the good guys found me first. \n\nSometimes all a kid needs is a little direction. ",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/270x7u/baby_mama_drama_from_another_state/",
        "text": "So, this is my first time posting in here, as I just found this subreddit.  I'm also posting from my phone so, bear with me.  Just needed a place to vent over this incident that happened yesterday.\n\nSo, yesterday I was called back to the PD to oversee a child exchange.  The baby daddy was picked up a few days ago for felony warrants over some type of child custody issue.  The baby had been staying with the baby daddy's brother (BDB).  This woman is coming all the way from multiple states away to retrieve her baby.  She was driving for 3 days.\n\nI arrive at the PD and talk to the social worker.  I'm all for the exchange bc I'm assuming the baby daddy is a piece of shit bc he got arrested for this felony warrant.  I come to find out, the baby and baby daddy fled the crazy baby mama bc she was supposedly smoking meth during her pregnancy and then attacked the baby daddy with a crack pipe and scratched his face as well as harming the baby.  The baby daddy came down here to get away from the craziness and her.  The baby mama got pissed and got child custody papers drawn up and then slammed the baby daddy with the felony warrant in their state.\n\nThis is sinking in for me when the baby mama shows up.  She looks the part of a piece of shit.  The social worker has to ask her questions before the baby can be turned over to her.  She asks who is with her.  The baby mama says her sister and a \"male companion\".  I'm thinking great, we for sure have a crazy woman here bc who really says that?  The social worker goes well, who's companion and baby mama goes mine.  The social worker goes alright, well do you have any other kids?  The baby mama goes \"yea I have ____ and he lives ____ (not with her)\".  The social worker goes \"alright, anymore?\". Baby mama goes yea, and gives the same answer - another kid not living with her.  Social worker goes \"that it?\".  Now baby mama is getting pissed.  She asking why she needs to know all this.  Social worker points to her sheet and says she has to ask.  Baby mama gives the same answer again.  So, we have a woman who has 3 OTHER kids, all not living with her.\n\nWhen this is done, BDB shows up with the baby.  Baby mama couldn't grab a hold of that kid fast enough.  BDB says that the baby needs to be changed and that he can do it.  He has diapers and wipes, etc in the bag.  Baby mama says no, she can do it.  She changes the baby while BDB watches with what looks like the beginning of tears.  The social worker goes alright, how about you let BDB say goodbye bc he was watching the baby for a few days and if it wasn't for him, the baby would be in DSS care.  Baby mama looks right at her and says no.  That he helped baby daddy get down here and won't let him near the baby again.  The social worker was floored.  I was floored.  This woman is the most rude, ungrateful bitch I had ever seen.  The social worker tells baby mama to follow her into another room but to leave the baby with BDB bc they have to finish some paperwork.  Baby mama leaves the baby.  I later learn the social worker did this just so BDB could say bye.\n\nWith paperwork done BDB leaves as does baby mama and her entourage (who looked just as trashy as her).  BDB was all red eyed.  After they leave, I go to the front desk with the social worker, where this all took place.  The lady that is working the front desk is bawling.  She goes I just hope that baby is taken care of.  Me, I'm on the other end of the spectrum.  I'm pissed.  I'm furious.  I wanted the baby stay with BDB, not some crack who're who won't give a shit about her, as told from her previous 3 kids not living with her.  I tell the social worker and front desk that everybody is suffering bc baby mama is a whore that can't keep her legs closed.  I mean seriously, she has ruined this man's life now with these felony charges.  She is on her way of ruining the life of that baby as well.  She is obviously an unfit mother after having 3 previous kids but none of them are living with her.  Why would she need to do this?  To prove a point?  You think she threw the previous 3 baby daddy's in jail as well?\n\nI just can't wrap my mind around it.  I'm usually a pretty upbeat guy, with an even temper, and I watch my mouth around people in the public (such as the social worker) but, I flat out called baby mama a whore in front of her as well as saying baby mama needs to keep her legs closed.  other swear words were thrown in as well.  I'm really wondering if baby mama is really fighting to get the baby back or, just the check that comes with her, which she can use to buy God knows what?\n\nFor what it's worth, BDB said that before baby daddy left, he checked ity the DA if he could leave and said that it was allowed.  Most of my work doesn't follow me home and people don't usually get under my skin but, this did.  Her home state DSS has already been notified and they already know who she is from previous encounters.  Let's hope the system can catch the baby.\n\nSorry for rambling and the wall of text but, thanks for reading.  Hope my story wasn't too long",

I use this place to vent, so hopefully, in 20 years, I don't suck start my Glock.\n\nI got sent to, kind of, a domestic call with my Boot (trainee). This 14 year old girl is having it out with her grandparents, whom she lives with. They basically claim that she's a little hellion, who runs amock, curses at them, hangs out with shady kids, and throws shit around the house. We continue to talk, and the grandparents can't single out a single incident in which a crime occured. More of just a general concensus that the kid is kind of a bitch, and they are at their whits ends.\n\nSo I meet with the skallywag. She looks like a 14 year old girl. Wearing Van's boat shoes with little stars, those rediculous skin tight tapered emo skinny jeans, a girl tshirt, with makeup and a semi emo haircat that hangs in her face a little. \n\nImmediately, she calls me by name. Yeah, she knows me from the mall. Not so much that we have interacted, but her friends have told her about me. (at least my reputation precedes me) She admitts to calling grandma a fucking bitch, and telling her to shut up, and sometimes not listening to them. But she also claims that Grandma changes the rules, mid rule, and gets confused about where she (kid) is, and when she's supposed to be back. Kid says grandma has told her she's not wanted there, and quite frankly, kid doens't really want to be there. But kid is smart enough to know that she has 3 1/2 years left before adulthood, and has to be there.\n\nI lay out the ground rules. She's a minor with rights and responsibilities. Unfortunately, the responsibilities greatly outweigh the rights. She can't swear at grandma. He room must be kept clean. She can not break ANYTHING in the house, for it ALL belongs to grandma. And finally, she can not leave without permission.\n\nThen, my Action Plan. Every time she leaves the house, she will write out where she is going, who she is with, when she will be back, and how to get ahold of her. And then she and grandma will sign it, and put it on the fridge. That way there is NO disagreement about when she was supposed to return, or where she was to be. It's a win win.\n\nDuring my long winded rant about families, kids, responsibilities, drugs, sex, and dangers, kid is generally happy. She is polite, smiles, and occasionally even laughs. I tell her that I am grounding her for tonight. She is to clean her room, and then read, write, or draw, in her room, until she goes to bed. The next day, she can leave the house. But tonight, she needs to stay in and clean her room. Having come to an agreement, we leave. Everyone is happy.\n\nAn hour later, I just started my lunch. I am 1 taco into my 3 taco combo. A suicide kicks out. Other units are going. Then I hear the address. I put my taco down. A 14 year old girl has cut herself with a razor. WTF?? We leave our lunch on the table and head to the car.\n\nSure as shit, it's the same girl. Un-fucking-believable. Boot drives back to the house.\n\nI walk in. Kid has her left arm wrapped in a towel. Her pants are soaked in blood. It's on the bed, her feet, the floor. I tell her to show me. She has about 40-50 superficial slices on her forearm. Not life threatening, but bleeding pretty good. Boot finds the razor blade on the floor. Broken disposable razor on the nightstand. I stare. In amazement. \"Well, you wanted attention. Here we are. What do you want?\" I ask. She starts crying. Says \"It's not about attention. I just want my grandmother to want me. I want to feel wanted.\" I asked her what she expected the outcome of this situation to be. She doesn't answer. I ask how we got from cleaning our room, to carving our arm. She doesn't answer. \n\nI ask her how I failed. What the fuck happened in the 60 minutes I was gone. How did we go from smiling and talking, and agreeing, and coming up with solutions, to this? How did we get from talking about making mature decisions, and thinking about consequences before acting to this? How, how the fuck, did I spend an hour and a half with your family, mediating 14 years of fucked up family life, and then leave, thinking I had fixed the problem? How did I get the wool pulled over my eyes that badly? How did I not see, hear, or feel a single fucking clue that this was going to happen? How did I Fail? She didn't answer. She didn't even look at me.\n\nIs she gonna die? Not from those cuts. Not unless she get's MRSA or something. But still. My job is to protect. No 14 year old girl should be carving herself up like that. Especially not 30 minutes after I talked with her.\n\nSo, I don't know what happened. I don't know how I didn't see it, or what I missed. I don't know what I said or did, or what I forgot to say, or didn't do. I really don't get it. But I'm seriously pissed. And I'm not quite sure how to get passed this one.\n",
