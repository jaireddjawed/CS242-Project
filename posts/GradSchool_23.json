I am applying for two degrees: International Political Economy and Environment&amp;Development. \n\nThe issue is, in my first year of college, i was having issues going to class because i couldnt make any friends and my anxiety was going bad due to this, so i withdrew myself from classes and eventually, i got a lot of grades on the scale from CC to FF. \n\nBut later, i convinced myself that even if i do not have an friends, it would be best for me to go to classes and I retook all these classes and i got AA from most of them, a couple BAs. \n\nI feel like I should mention this in my personal statement. And i think this situation can even be used to increase my chances to get an offer. But i dont know how to put it. Should I mention that because I was feeling alone and  due to my social anxiety I didnt put the effort into classes. I feel like this is too personal but i dont know what else i can say. Any advice would be great. Thanks already!",

        "text": "So 2022 was a strange year, and I kind of lost the momentum a bit. I am a part time MA student and I also work full time and have a family, so for all my coursework I have basically worked myself to the ground. Got good results.\n\nI am now writing my final thesis. It is relatively small - equivalent to 1 semester of full time studying in credit points, but the quality still needs to be good.\n\nSince I am part time, I have one year to complete it. But the previous semester was such a mess, and I struggled a bit with my mental health (mild, I just think it was a normal response to the pandemic) and found it impossible to find the adrenaline and discipline I had during the coursework part of my course. \nI have been at it continuously, but I basically haven’t spent enough time on my thesis.\n\nI also find it so hard to combine work, family and studying now. Work is suddenly more demanding (I started my degree as I was getting a bit bored - I am not bored now…), and my family situation is more demanding with me having fewer available hours after work due to the activities of my husband and children. \n\nAnyway, enough excuses. I am just wondering what all you seasoned academics think when I say I am maybe 70 percent done with my analyses. Maybe. Depends on how my supervisor judges the quality… The chapter needs to be restructured. I have a fair idea for the discussion chapter, but have only written notes. I have not written the theory chapter yet and have a lot of reading to catch up on. Which will of course affect everything else…\nThe methods chapter is under control in my head and partly on paper. \n\nI have never done this before, so I am so stressed, mainly because this is all unknown territory. The thesis is due in June and I feel really behind. \nI have the option to postpone it one semester, but I don’t really want to. However I also don’t want to break my neck or suffer burn out.\n\n(On a positive note, I am a professional writer, so I can produce decent text in a short time. This is probably why my results have consistently been good - I master the academic jargon and I can get a lot done in a short time as long as I know what needs to be said, and I am a ruthless editor… )\n\nBut yeah. Am I really behind? Where should I ideally be at this stage…?",

My colleague is pursuing PhD just like me, but unlike me, who is getting departmental stipend, he is funded partially by his company (where is a cofounder in this 4-people company) and some kind of research grant that is separate from the department. So, he is not getting any monetary support from our department or his PI. \n\nHe does a lot of business stuff and does a lot of networking over linkedin, which is how he has come to build his own company in a foreign nation. Why it is based on a foreign nation is kinda beyond me, but again, I don't want to dig into him too much. However, I have noticed that he has been out of his lab for a long time last year, and cumulatively, the time he was in the lab is shorter than the time he spent outside for his \"business\" activities. And I am not including winter break or holiday weeks in this off-lab time period. It's just baffling to me because if I had been 1/3 away from lab as much as he was, my PI would kill me regardless the reasons. To my knowledge, he plans to make this his last year of PhD, just like me, but he has not published anything. I had a casual conversation with his PI a few days ago and the PI off handedly told me that he wouldn't be surprised if my colleague decided to come back on this December instead of February. \n\nI helped a bit on his experiment in the past, and I m kinda worried for him. Knowing his \"intellectual property\" - which he somehow managed to register in his company's name instead of our school, but that's another topic - I know his lab techniques are far less than some MS students, or even BS students I know. My own PI is in his committee and expressed several times to me in private that he is not optimistic about my colleague's progress. \n\nIs this normal?",

It’s finally over. \n\nMy previous supervisor was a horrible and racist woman who has a history of infantilizing and tokenizing non-white students. On our first meeting she thought I was an international student, she would cut me off and correct me whenever I’d mispronounce things, and constantly belittle my feedback on a group project we were on. The list goes on. She was a horrible mentor to me as well, like she never helped me with grants, hardly showed up to meetings, and would never respond to emails. I spoke to my program about all this and they basically told me to walk it off and continue on. \n\nThe catalyst for me was when I was leaving a group project and we were introducing ourselves to a new member and she cut me off during introductions and had a conversation with the new individual. She then responded, “thanks for introducing yourself OP” and I immediately said “I didn’t say anything about myself at all, thanks for cutting me off.” She sent a flimsy apology email and made some interesting assumptions, which I responded to and didn’t accept her apology. \n\nAfter gathering some strength and information from my committee members, I finally contacted the Equity Office and lodged a complaint stating I couldn’t continue on like this. Few months later, I finally found a replacement supervisor. I am never tolerating bullying in any capacity.",

I have a good relationship with the faculty and we discussed the generalities of funding during the application process. I received notification that I was recommended for admission by my graduate program, but that a final decision from the graduate school was dependent on additional materials. It then listed an enrollment intention form and official undergrad transcripts as required materials. As it stated these items were needed prior to a final decision, I immediately completed the form and requested the transcripts. Later I learned from my program that if I accepting admission I limited the funding options open to me and that I shouldn’t have completed the intention form.  The program had asked me to contact them for next steps once I had a decision from the grad school, but I didn’t think I had an official decision as it said I needed to submit the materials for a final decision to be made.  Has anyone experienced anything like this?  I won’t be able to do the program without the funding and am very concerned that I inadvertently did not follow the program’s guidance and therefore blew up my funding package. Any insights on similar experiences would be very appreciated!",

But when I checked my student portal after the waiver went through their was a bunch of various campus fees totaling up to about to over a thousand dollars for stuff like part-time campus use. This all needs to be paid in a few days time or I’ll accumulate additional fees.I checked with all the other people with tuition waivers on campus and was told this isn’t avoidable. Uhhh, wtf? Has anyone else with a tuition waiver had this problem? I’m meeting with financial aid and have contacted my advisor, but I’m kind of freaking out.

But I've realised the modules offered in my programme are not enough for the said specialisation. I've completed one semester and second semester is ongoing right now.\n\nSo now I'm planning to withdraw my enrolment and apply for a MSc in Cyber Security in UK, because if I'm going to invest money and time in masters I'd like to invest them on something thats aligned with my goals. \n\nAnd I'd like some help with explaining this situation in the applications. I have explained the reason for withdrawing in my Personal Statement and also in my CV. But should I upload any documents related to my masters mentioning which exams I've passed and my grades? I only have details on the first semester where I've passed 3 modules and I'm not sure if I'll get an official transcript for that, but I can get a document stating which exams I've passed and confirming my attendance at the university. Also I can try to get a Letter of Recommendation from a professor at my current master's programme. \n\nSo should I upload any documents related to my current Masters or just upload the documents till my Bachelors?\n\nIf anyone here has been in the same situation, please guide me on how to proceed with my applications further. I'm eternally grateful for your help!",

        "text": "Hello lovely people. I'm not a very good writer, but somehow, my abstract got selected for a conference this summer. The conference is covering for my travel, stay and lodging. But, I recently got to know about a chancellor's grant that funds and covers expenses for those who are working on their own research for conferences. The website mentions that it can be used to cover research, travel, food and lodging. My research would involve reading a couple of books, which I already have access to, and my travel is already as covered as well. I'm very new to this entire system of research-conferences-grants and have no idea how it works. But is there some, errr, ethical way I could still apply for the grant, and use that money to maybe cover my rent or something else ? Or how about using the same grant to get a laptop or something, since the one I'm using currently to, \"research\" keeps running into issues ? I don't know if I'm asking the right questions here, but help please.",

It took a lot of work to finally get to the point of taking and passing the NCLEX, but we’re here. \n\nHowever, a huge, huge dream of mine, is to eventually practice as an Psych NP. \n\nI wanted to practice as a nurse for a year (as recommended) go to school full time, and be done within 2 years instead of 4. This trajectory would let me graduate at 29-31 years old. \n\nGetting my own place would make grad school difficult, no doubt. I’d have to cut hours in my job, pay my bills somehow, go to clinicals after work/do homework as well. It would just make life a lot harder\n\nIf I stayed, I wouldn’t have to pay rent. I could pay some chunks off my loans, go to school full time and work part time so I’d save cash. The stress of trying to survive and keep it all together wouldn’t be there, which leaves me more time to focus on school.\n\nHowever, that’s a long time with my parents. Everywhere I see, everyone advocates moving out and getting your life together on your own. I really can’t help but feel like a loser. \n\nBut at the same time, If I just stay an RN, I’m not making the money or living the life I want. I prob wouldn’t stay in the city I’m in and love and would move to somewhere more affordable. And this would be all for society accepting me for independence \n\nMy dating life and social life would prob suffer due to judgment from being home as well. I just don’t know…",

        "text": "This is the first semester that I’m dealing with physical disability, and I feel like I’m slowly but surely figuring things out. My accommodations are just about worked out. My part time class work now counts as full time. I can get through two classes in a day relatively painlessly thanks to one of my wonderful professors agreeing to store some medical equipment I had been lugging around campus. I’ve stayed on top of things, and even though I spent most of last weekend in a ball of pain, I turned in all of my assignments by the deadline.\n\nTwo years ago, this would have felt like the bare minimum. I was full time, a TA, and I helped run a nonprofit. Shit hadn’t hit the fan quite yet.\n\nI guess that’s why I’m having so much trouble accepting my current struggles. \n\nMore specifically, I’m having a really, really hard time with networking. And friends. And just meeting people in general. I don’t *know* anyone in my cohort. We were all virtual when we got started. I was already an oddball because I was the only non-engineering major in my cohort. I’m also like a decade older than everyone. \n\nI know networking is important for employment. And friends are good for mental health. So I do want to try.\n\nToday, for example, I decided I would go to a social. But I missed it. I couldn’t make myself take the half hour bus ride to campus. I was in pain. I wanted to keep lying down with ice and relax instead. Right after that was a seminar for someone’s research and then a happy hour. More sitting. Sitting hurts. I wanted to lie down with ice. I could bring a cushion but that’s weird at a bar downtown. Plus I can’t drink alcohol. I take too many medications.\n\nSo I didn’t go. The biggest obstacle is that I don’t want to do things that are physically painful. Usually this is normal. But if I always follow that instinct, I’m never going to get out. The other problem is that it’s really, really difficult for me to talk coherently when I’m in pain. I’m usually pretty outgoing, but if I hurt badly enough I will go to the bathroom and curl up on the floor. After sitting for several hours in class, I’m usually in a lot of pain. Like today. It was \ndefinitely a bathroom floor kind of day.\n\nSo this keeps happening. I miss events. Networking and socializing happen at night when I’m in the most agony and have the least mobility. I’m having such a hard time meeting faculty outside of my current professors, and it seems like students all already know each other. It’s difficult to slip into their conversations. I’m not in a lab at the moment (not until I get my undergrad prereqs), so I can’t meet people like this either.\n\nNot to mention i’m just proud when I make it through a whole day. Pain is exhausting. I hardly think about other people.\n\nUntil I remember once again that other people are how I’ll eventually get the connections for a job.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for grad school networking? If I plan to be here 3 years, is it ok to take this semester and kind of just get used to things first? I’m worried about what will happen when faculty and potential PIs realize I’m not exactly the same high energy powerhouse they accepted into their program anymore. I’m desperately trying to get back there. But… baby steps. And I still really want to do research : (.\n\nMy worst nightmare is that they’ll think i’ve become lazy. It just takes a lot more effort to do smaller tasks now!",

        "text": "So my advisor is quite old and has garnered quite a reputation from his haydays in our field. Now it seems he is able to use this prestige to get lots of funding for various projects. He also is extremely confident in his and his students' abilities, so he will claim in proposals that we are able to measure things without doing all the footwork and calculations needed to ensure it's possible. Of course quite a few of the projects are successful, but it seems that a many are also unsuccessful.\n\nWhen I joined the group I of course was not aware of this problem. I took on one small project during my first two or so years that was successful, and after that I inherited a project from a postdoc that was leaving the group. At the time the project seemed like it would work. Well now I am 3.5 years into this project and nothing is quite working out. We gave up on the original goal of the project after finding out it was impossible with the equipment we have. It took me a long time to convince my advisor that it wasn't possible as he mostly just implied that it was my fault. Eventually I provided enough evidence that with our equipment we simply could not measure what we originally intended to. We have since moved the goalposts but things continue to only marginally work.\n\nHe continues to apply pressure and somewhat imply that it is my fault that it does not work and that I just need to think harder about it or work harder and it will work out. He offers marginally useful advice but for the most part it is all up to me. I feel as though this project is just a shitty project.\n\nNow that I have been through this I see some of the projects in our lab with a different lens. There is another project that our new post doc inherited. I have watched this project pass through 4 different grad students and postdocs over my 6ish years so far and not one of them have been able to make it work with not a single paper coming out of it.\n\nNow one of the newer grad students is starting a new project based on a recently awarded grant our advisor received. I asked him some questions about it, some fundamental things that from my experience I would calculate before even considering if it was possible. He told me that our advisor said that they will \"figure that out when they get there.\" I feel concerned for him and have serious doubts about that project.\n\nI feel it is probably time for my advisor to retire. I just wanted to rant and perhaps see if anyone has been in a similar situation. I'm going to try to scrape together a paper from my project and finish my PhD but I'm concerned at how much longer this will take.\n\nTL;DR Advisor is old, has prestige, and overconfident so he gets funding for poorly thought out, borderline impossible projects that students and postdocs get stuck on.",

I started the program immediately after receiving my Bachelors degree. I did so because I thought it was the expected and natural transition. \n\nI will say that I didn’t quite balance my options during my last few years of undergrad. I again, just did what was “right” and expected of me. So here I am, back at square one, only this time I have a backup plan. \n\nI didn’t have a topic nailed down, though I knew what my more general focus would be. This is where I really found myself stumbling in the program: not really knowing how to apply the breadth of knowledge to my intended career. Couple that with the lingering stress of family asking what I planned to do after graduating, my stress and anxiety doubled (tripled). I became even more burned out, stressed, anxious, and quite frankly—lost. One thing that has absolutely stuck with me for as long as I have been in school, is the disappointment I have always felt from failing to perform. “What will my family think when they learn that I won’t finish xyz within the timeframe that I initially stated?”\n\nI am quite disappointed with myself about not performing as well as I know I could have. Yet, I know that I can always go back. The knowledge that I have so far has not gone anywhere, so I know that I can try my hand at this again. \n\nAnyone else experience having a dream deferred? I plan to re-enroll with another institution and complete the degree very soon, but I’m kinda feeling “eh” at this point. Being 20-something has been quite a journey for me…",

        "text": "Hello!  \n\n\nI'm a recent HBA graduate from from the University of Toronto. I'm interesting in applying to MPA programs (particularly Queens and Carleton), and I was wondering what my chances are like? My overall CGPA is a 3.6 with my last 2 years being around a 3.74. I have a ton of volunteer experience (VP of a club, student mentor, leadership roles in a few different organizations) as well as part-time work experience. However, I have no experience in policy-related work. How much of a chance do I stand?",

        "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI wanted some opinions on this:\n\nAs a grad student, do you prefer to date someone of a similar education level?\n\nDo you think it's shallow to prefer that since education level doesn't necessarily equate intelligence?\n\nI was curious since I'm currently pursuing a doctorate degree, and would prefer at least a bachelor's from someone, has a decent job, and definitely someone who is driven. A friend of mine didn't quite understand this preference, but for me it was never something I'd never given a second thought. \n\nThe huge difference in income is kinda scary to me too since a lot of arguments can come from finances (seen it first hand from my parents).",

        "text": "I am in a PhD Clinical psychology program and was summoned for jury duty. I heard from another student they were able to be excused by having the director of our program write him a letter saying he is a full time student. I tried this method, but for some reason for me, they responded saying this is not enough to be excused but I can postpone it for up to 6 months and to choose a date when I am on break. The issue is we are only in classes for 1 day a week at this point of our program, instead we are in clinical training year-round accruing clinical training hours for internship applications, which I need more of. I will have to postpone it regardless because I have interviews for my 4th year externship for the next couple of weeks. However, even if I postpone it for when my class semester is technically over, I will likely be missing the lest couple of weeks at my current externship which I really don't want to do since I am already missing some weeks for a vacation.",

While I had an ok relationship with my PI, and they included me in one of their small projects after my graduation, they did some things that seemed like red flags to me, such as giving my samples (that I had bought and prepared, and was promised to work on) to someone else to work on as their thesis project without asking me, breaking promises, or asking me to work on some of their projects with my name not being mentioned on the author's list.\n\nSo a long while after graduation, when our communication became less frequent, I had to change my phone due to problems and didn't give my new number to them, and we lost touch. The problem is they are suddenly trying to reach out to me through my relative's account!!! and I don't know what to do or how to react. (They emailed me the next day, asking me to call them).\n\nI don't know if not calling them would be ok/polite (or burning the bridges?), but I kind of don't want to get back to those times of getting weird requests from them or having false hope. Besides calling them and ingoring them later would also weird. \n\nWhat would you suggest? What would you do?",
