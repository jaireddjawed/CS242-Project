I had it for a total of 5 years but never put too much effort into it and didn‚Äôt really understand it.\n\nNow however, 2 years after I last had a course in spanish, I feel like learning it again. Maybe on my own terms this time around. I wanted to do a trip throughout the Americas. Speaking spanish would certainly help. \n\nI do use duolingo, not that I think it helps that much but just so I can do something language based daily. Being swedish, I don‚Äôt struggle with pronounciation. It is somewhat similar to spanish so I think I‚Äôll eventually get by just fine.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm seeking is tips and guides on how to continue from where I left off. It is of course hard for you to know my progress (IDK BX or CX level either). I also just found this sub so there‚Äôs that! \n\nWhere would you advice me to start off? Any certain techniques that would be useful?",

I see that Anki is the crowd favorite, but I want to know the exact why.\n\nGoldlist is intriguing to me, especially since I'm learning a language that uses a completely different alphabet than my NL and all other languages I have already learned. It would force me to use the alphabet of my TL, which seems good. \n\nAnki has proven to be ineffective for me, despite proper daily usage over 60 straight days. I'm still not absorbing the same set of words. And it's like 100 words. \n\nI admit that I'm neurodivergent and have a TBI, but my short-to-long term circuits seem to work just fine in any other context. And that's literally less than 2 words a day. I could learn them much faster by straight forced repetitive repeating.\n\nI'm personally so sick of hearing how Anki is god-like, but that might be just my frustration talking--and I'm wondering if Goldlist might be a better option for me. But I'm unclear about the science of either method.\n\nSo, please explain it like I'm a kid. Why Anki vs. Goldlist (or literally any other method for vocab)",

However for example on call of duty mw2 there are bits and pieces of spanish and my friends have been playing it and ask me to translate or in farcry 6 my friends would say \"what does this mean?\" \n\nNow most of the time I don't really know verbatim what it is but I could tell you at least a topic or what I think it means because I'm getting to a point where in context and from reading native speakers I get faint ideas of what things mean. For example \"√≥rale\" my friend asks me what does that mean and I say I don't know it sounds like maybe slang but I'd think it means to hurry up or something based on the context of mw2 or even in a song I have on they'll ask to translate it and sometimes I like to practice translating songs but I'm not very good at it but I can tell you the rough idea of a song. \n\nWould it be fair to say that it's not the most incredibly useful to know another language of you can't necessarily translate it?

Any tips?\n\nOn the other hand I've taken an A1 language class in German and I find it really difficult (I got an A in the course). German words are actually harder for my brain as Hungarian ones rely more heavily on vowels (Despite SZ for S sound, it seems Hungarian has less consostant clusters). In German I struggle with genders the most but also, despite not knowing but 2 or 3 words in Hungarian, Hungarian is easier to read than German and even Polish. I think knowing some light Turkish from TV soaps helps as well in terms of the way words are put together in Hungarian.\n\nMaybe it's in my blood as it's very possible Proto-Bulgar probably had a similar grammar structure to Hungarian. And maybe it helps I dig the culture, I find Budapest one of the most beautiful capital in Europe and *the* most attractive in Central Europe.",

        "text": "This is a story that happened right now 10 years ago, when I was in Dublin to learn English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was with a friend queuing at a caf√©, and my friend wanted to order a latte for he and his girlfriend. We had been in the queue for some good 20 minutes.\n\nWhen it was his turn to order, he realized that he didn't know how to pronounce *latte*. Being spelled similarly as *late*, he pronounced it as such (/le…™t/ instead of /l…ë.te…™/). \n\nSo he ordered *2 latte* like /tu le…™t/, raising the hand and making an V sign with 2 fingers for visual aid.\n\nNot only his pronunciation really sounded like \"*too late*\" (which was plausible, after 20 minutes in the queue), but we also didn't know that in Ireland (and other Commonwealth countries) one must do the V sign with the palm facing outward, because otherwise it can be considered an insult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the waitress readily interpreted the order as \"*too late now, f\\* off*\", which made for an extremely tense and uncomfortable minute, as the guard approached us with a very serious guard face. \n\nOnly the nervous smile of my friend, while pointing with the eyes to the menu behind the waitress, saved the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this happened to him and not to me for a very simple reason: I wanted a latte too, but because I didn't know how to pronounce it, I chose a tea instead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI derive 3 lessons from this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- First, even if at that point our English was quite miserable, we instantly became world experts in recognizing and pronouncing the word *latte*. My accent still leaves to be desired, but my god, do I nail *latte*... for some reason, everything that you learn in a highly emotional situation immediately sticks like nobody's business. \n\nEmotion is the single most effective memory hack in existence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Secondly, the waitress probably forgot all about it the day after, but I still remember it 10 years later.  In 99.99% of cases is only the one suffering it that makes a big deal of an embarrassing situation, and it is a such shame that the fear of making or saying something stupid stops us from learning more meaningfully.\n\nShould not be for my friend, I would still probably be ordering teas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The third lesson is the simplest: Smile. No matter what the situation, always smile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHappy learning everyone, and don't be afraid of *lattes*!",

I am applying to medical school in 1.5 years, and I want to add another language to my tool belt, not just for competitiveness but also for my personal development. Here are my options and thought processes: \n\n1. Mandarin. This is my first choice because I find the language beautiful and challenging, and it is incredible when non-Chinese people speak fluent Mandarin. I live in the Bay Area and hope to stay in this community for medical school and residency, and there is a more significant Asian population here. My partner and I talk about enrolling our kids (whenever we have them) into a dual language school where they teach Mandarin and English. This would be useful to have conversations with them as they grow up.\n2. French. My partner is Brazilian and fluent in Portuguese, French, English, and Spanish. He spent five years studying in France for his Ph.D., and we casually dream that one day we'll retire in France. I took a year of French in college, and I enjoyed it. Yet again, I find this language beautiful and would be proud to be a French speaker traveling in Europe.\n3. Brazilian Portuguese. Although they live in Brazil and we don't see them regularly, the only person I know I can speak Portuguese with is my partner. My partner's family only speaks Portuguese and no English. When we have kids, this might become a more significant issue since they'll probably be around, and I won't be able to communicate with them.\n4. German. I am half-German and half-Mexican. My name is G√ºnter, and I don't speak German, lol. Imagine introducing yourself as G√ºnter in Germany and don't speak any German. Not that I care, but it is a tad bit embarrassing. I have a German family, but not much. I could only speak German with some distant cousins, my dad and aunt.  \n\nI know this post is \"do what you want,\" but I am curious if anyone has some insight or advice to sway me in a particular direction. If you made it this far, thanks!",

Along the way I've used several different techniques such as extensive listening and reading (√† la Krashen), and also doing flashcards SRS style with Anki and Pleco.  I feel like each of these techniques has its own pros and cons, but I'm curious if anyone has used a similar technique like the one I'm about to describe that is sort of a mix of the two methods.\n\nSuppose you have some form on comprehensible input, this could be a movie, book or podcast, but let's go with a book for this example.  As for units to measure your progress, you could also use things like sentences, paragarphs, or chapters.  Let's use paragraphs for this example.  \n\nMy idea is that on day one you read paragraphs 1 through 5.  On day two, you read paragraphs 2 through 6.  On day 3 you read paragragraphs 3 through 7 etc.  Below is a table to help visual for what I am thinking. P(n) is the paragraph, and the X indicates what paragraphs you should read on that day.\n\n\n | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 | P6 | P7 | P8 | P9 | P10\n---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nDay1 | X | X | X | X | X |  |  |  |  | \nDay2 |  | X |X  |X  |X  |X  |  |  |  | \nDay3 |  |  | X |X  |X  |X  |X  |  |  | \nDay4 |  |  |  |X  |X  |X  |X  |X  |  | \nDay5 |  |  |  |  |X  |X  |X  |X  |X  | \nDay6 |  |  |  |  |  |X  |X  |X  |X  |X \n\nHas anyone ever tried a technique like this, and if so, did it help you acquire your language any faster than extensive reading or SRS alone?  \n\nI feel like this could be a good way to get repetition into your routine without having to endure the tediousness and boredom of flashcards.  It may not be a \"perfect\" methord according to the Anki SRS algorithm.  It's also not perfect according to the extensive reading model either, as the input becomes less and less compelling with each subsequent read, but in the end I feel like something like this could have positive results, even though I haven't tried it yet.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/10dt37t/fascinating_observations_regarding_the_silent/",
        "text": "I would like to preface by saying that my personality is that of wanting to know the whys of how things work, not necessarily looking for resolve. Meaning, aside from language learning, I enjoy connecting dots from a psych/sociological aspect in understanding why we do what we do. I know that folks online tend to thrive on the ignorant in that we tend to want to answer questions, rather than flesh out ideas from original posters. Also, I know that I came off pretty passionate in my previous post, so this time it's less about me, and more about the culture of language learning itself. The reason that prompted me to write this post is due to my wild experience this weekend visiting Mersin, Turkey, after having traveled from Istanbul. \n\nAs I said, I love to connect dots and understand the deeper meanings of social dynamics. As such, I'm heavily in tune with various subcultures such as fitness, nutrition, music, politics, cars, astrology, personality traits, current events, etc... In that, I have found a striking correlation between many of these groups. What I have noticed is that the deeper you get into a particular area of interests, you pass a certain threshold by where commonality no longer exists between the newbies and veterans of these spaces. With language learning, there seems to be more discussion on fluency, rather than the real world struggles of functional language learners. What's kind of frightening is that you have people imposing their views on others based on \"scientific research\". To be more specific, I have found similarities between the silent period (language learning) fasting/keto (fitness/nutrition) and NOFAP (period of no masturbating within men's self-help groups). I have literally read tons of posts/responses on delaying speaking, people discussing not breaking their \"silent period fast\" for over a year, and relishing on several months of no output. \n\nI find this extremely interesting that we have debates on whether to speak or not when it comes to language learning. Perhaps living in America has corrupted my idea of language learning because as so many immigrants arrive, they often must attempt to speak for the most part. This is not coming from a place of judgement, but more so of fascination. It is if we are promoting home schooling for language learning, rather than realizing that some people must travel and attend work or schooling abroad. \n\nThis is simply a working theory, but it seems as if the active online community has been overrun by language learners without an explicit need to learn a language. Therefore, their mindset is different to that of those who have to use it as a means to function daily. I have even read others telling folks, who experience passive bilingualism, that the reason why they aren't able to speak is because \"they don't have enough input\"- despite the person just simply not having practiced output enough. What is even beyond fascinating, but downright insane, was a person telling another poster to not necessarily worry about output for a few years when learning a language. That advice alone can seriously cause someone to question how we even got to this point... However, I do believe that sometimes we need to get out of our own ways and accept that people have experiences vastly different to our own. The concept of \"I have never experienced this, therefore it doesn't exist\" is highly prevalent amongst the online community. \n\nThe question then becomes- who are the points of reference for the common functional language learner just trying to get by in their target country? We give advice on preventing bad habits and fossilization, but who exactly are we targeting? Do we advise those who migrate to Mexico and India to delay their output?  If we have all these folks wearing their CEFR patches on their arms, giving advice from the comfort of their native home, it then becomes hard to relate to those struggling while living in their target country. Perhaps, those who are in their target country aren't online, but rather busy immersing their way to output.  Not to offend anyone but to me, it almost feels as if we have entered the world of Whole-foods vs your local grocery store when it comes to language learning. It's as if it all stems from the need to be fluent, rather than functional in your use of a language. You have those who can afford the luxury of spending months on input, tutors, and paid online software, whereas others have to rely on broken language just to get by day to day. For those that state that they never learned a language while living in their TL country, only means that the motivation wasn't there. This was my idea behind my previous post, but I admit that I came off a bit gunny with some of my choice of words. Again, this is not a matter of \"do what feels right\", but more so of this being much of the content that new language learners are presented with. \n\nFor me having to move to Germany in a few months, all the research regarding language learning is basically all about Comprehensible Input and less on immersion and output. For example, the same author of short stories that I have been consuming simultaneously has videos on why immersion isn't a great language learning strategy for beginners. I may be projecting here, but perhaps he is catering to a certain demographic of folk who have the above stated time and luxury. So, the question again becomes who are the people that we are using as reference- especially for those who need to use foreign language as a means to function... Seriously, type in silent period and you will find how many people are cozied up with their books and discussing whether to speak now or wait a year or two. So, that right there is extremely fascinating and I wonder what creates that mindset, as well as how much digitization has affected the way language learners socially interact. I can't even count the number of times I have heard or read people say that they \"developed a better accent as a result of waiting to speak\"... How does one even come to that conclusion? I am telling you that I have come across some interesting points.\n\nTo close with my own story from this past weekend, I had the hardest time in Mersin. In Istanbul, one can get by without even having to know Turkish for the most part. I decided that since I will only be here for one year, I wanted to fully engage in French and German via listening/reading. I have made no effort to learn the basic Turkish vocabulary whatsoever. This weekend was surely eye-opening. Shopping at the mall was a struggle, traveling by taxi, and even getting into some of the busier restaurants was challenging. It's not so much the struggle, but more of not knowing even the basic words such as right/left, food items, excuse me, etc...  Again, this is not me traveling to my TL country for the experience. I actually live here and have an address; this is my home for 12-15 months or longer, depending on if I want to renew my contract. I simply hate not being able to express myself freely and have dialogue with people. I enjoy asking questions and figuring things out. I remember living in Latvia around 2002 and was able to get around the city with only a few months of learning words/sentences. Had I introduced CI via reading and listening, I probably would have been having conversations after 13 months. What worked was picking up on vocabulary and using them daily. However, since I haven't lived outside the US since 2004, I haven't had to revisit the process of learning a language. To my wife's surprise, I still remember sentences, times, and numbers even after 20 years of leaving that country and never using Latvian. I suppose I have the learning gene as many of the diplomats in my family do.\n\nNonetheless, there was an incident this weekend in Mersin by where my party was greeted upon entering into a particular establishment, but when it was apparent that we didn't speak Turkish, it suddenly became \"reservation only\". Throughout the interaction, it was told to us that \"when we go to America, we have to speak English. When you are in Turkey, you have to speak Turkish\". I am not going to lie to you... That really hit me and I dwelled on that for a moment because for so many years, I have been hearing something similar while living in Miami, Florida towards the Cubans. \n\nI had a conversation with one particular restaurant owner who is originally from Belgium, but of Turkish parents and speaks English, Turkish, Russian, French, Flemish, and German.  We discussed how he learned English and my process of learning German. He told me that I have to speak. Yes, reading and listening is good, but I have to make mistakes and speak. He mentioned that during his days as a salesman in Bodrum, he had to learn the profiles of the customers in order to develop rapport for more sales. This was how he learned French, Russian and English as it was a matter of survival and repeating the same sentences over and over. Eventually he was having full conversations by simply listening to native speakers and repeating what they said. \n\nSo, this is not a criticism towards those who rather bathe in their silent period. I am not attacking anyone, so please do not take it as though I am trying to undermine anyone and I am not looking for a fight. This is simply a conversation of what I have been observing. I am still trying to find what will work for me, but what I do know is that I must acquire the basic German vocabulary for the next few months. I will then get out there with real people, take a few in-person courses, and interact with real folks when I arrive in Germany in June. As for French, I will continue reading/listening, and begin engaging with more French family members. I will of course use reading and listening to fine tune, but I can't afford the luxury of not \"breaking my silent period fast\". I have to literally go out and eat 6 meals a day or else I will be left starving when I visit my family in France come July, lol...\n\nFinally, if you have no interest in reading this lengthy post, taking the time to comment that you have no intention on reading this entire post says something about you... Just move on.",

Recognition is no problem, obviously, and even the reverse, when asked to produce target language, I know which language I'm supposed to supply out of the three.\n\nWhile this may be manageable with a relatively small deck, maybe it would be wiser to have separate decks, but I like having everything in one place. \n\nThoughts?\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "Bit of context: I was born &amp; raised in the UK, but my parents &amp; siblings were all born in India in a small state off the west coast called Goa. So I grew up with only my family speaking to me \"Konkani\" (our native language) and I only ever talked to other people in English. My siblings both speak fluent English with British accents, and my dad rarely speaks to me in Konkani. It's mostly only my mum that speaks to me in Konkani. I understand about 90% of the language, and I understand the language through context but don't know a lot of literal translation, which is where I feel like my problem is. Whenever I try and speak the language I often try and translate the words from English to Konkani because I'm not sure how else to formulate sentences without knowing the meaning of words. I can have simple conversational interactions, for example if I'm at a shop or if I'm greeting someone, but I can't have deep conversations or make jokes as I would in English. It's weird because if I hear a word, I'll know what it means, but if I'm speaking and trying to convey something I'll often forget the word. It's annoying because I also learnt Spanish at school from the ages of 11 to 16 and I literally speak that better than my native language. Any tips on how I can improve on my speaking skills? Its hard to learn with writing because we use the devanagari script, and because its use is limited, there isn't much content online to learn from. I feel like I could easily nail the language in 3-4 months if I had something to learn from because my pronounciation on words is pretty good. The only sort of \"education\" I think I could learn from is by watching movies in our native language from CDs I have at home.",
