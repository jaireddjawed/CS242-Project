        "text": "Ok. So the title will need some work before I submit this to an economics journal (haha!).\n\nI've been thinking about the problem of homelessness in the United States for a few months now. It bugs me that it should be an intractable problem, those should be rare and involve hard physics. It also occurred to me that if the problem were solvable for one city government or another, then the cheapest solution for other cities would be to buy one-way bus tickets to the city that solved homelessness. (Note: that already happens occasionally and those that do it go so far as to defend the practice.)\n\nIt's a variation on prisoner's dilemma.\n\nThis tends to discourage any municipality from attempting to solve homelessness. As soon as they succeed, suddenly they'd be inundated by new arrivals. It's difficult to estimate how many would arrive and over the course of how many years, but also rather likely that the budget margins for such a project will be thin enough that (for smaller cities) even just dozens more could endanger the viability of the program itself.\n\nParadoxically, homelessness might be more solvable if city and county governments can actually deny (some of) the homeless the benefits of the program. If they can turn away those who have been sent by other cities on one-way bus tickets, the homeless have no reason to agree to leave... they don't get much (or any) benefit from going elsewhere. They stay where they are and pressure that city to deal with their own homelessness problem.\n\nOf course, this doesn't actually give us any clues for how to solve homelessness itself (flaming truckloads of cash launched out of giant trebuchets), but it does make it a more manageable problem.\n\nNow this idea isn't without its own perils. If a city government can deny some, would it not be cheaper to deny all of the homeless? That's mostly what already occurs. So we'd have to also define just which homeless *are* their responsibility. And it's necessary to define it in such a way that they are responsible for almost all (more than 90% certainly, probably more than 95%) of their existing homeless population, excluding mostly only those bussed in from elsewhere (should that happen).\n\nHypothetical example city of 175,000 people. This isn't a sprawl city, rural townships with small populations here and there, but county governments take care of the rest. Let's say that they have 500 homeless (the city I'm from has a few tens of thousands more population, but fewer than 500 homeless). They're not the first to implement this policy in the United States, so other cities may already be considering sending a horde their way. They may or may not have a recent \"homelessness\" census to rely on (cities usually don't like to pay for that, considering that the results might be embarrassing). The qualifications for homelessness assistance need to look something like the following:\n\n1. The homeless person has inhabited in the city or surrounding area for a total of 18 months or longer in the past 2 years (as of the date of implementation)\n2. The homeless person was born in the city or surrounding area and resided there for at least 12 years prior to reaching the age of majority\n3. The homeless person's parents were both born in the city or surrounding area and resided there for 2/3rds or more of their natural lives, or if still living, 2/3rds of their lives as of the date of qualification determination\n4. The homeless person resided in the city or surrounding area for 2 years prior to becoming homeless through eviction, building condemnation, natural disaster, or similar circumstances\n5. The homeless person worked in the city or surrounding area for for 4 years prior to becoming homeless through circumstances relating to layoffs or employment termination without cause\n6. The homeless person is the legal spouse or dependent of another who qualifies \n\nThe first rule is important because many homeless people may not qualify in any city in the whole of North America, but shouldn't be ignored or otherwise short-shrifted. This obligates the municipal government to qualify even those who haven't ever had strong connections to any particular city or region, but disqualifies any who come in after the date.\n\nThe second and third rules qualify anyone with strong hometown ties to the area.\n\nThe fourth and fifth rules, of course, suggest that anyone who becomes homeless after having a home in the city is the responsibility of said city. \n\nAnd the sixth rule is necessary for those homeless families where otherwise some members would qualify but not others.\n\nAny of these rules by itself would qualify a person to receive benefits from a homeless program. If the homeless person would qualify in multiple cities, they still wouldn't be disqualified. With that in mind, there probably needs to be one more rule that disqualifies:\n\n1. The homeless person has arrived from another city where hypothetically similar rules would qualify them for benefits there \n\nI need to word the above better, but it's late and I'm groggy. Imagine cities A and B existed, with a homeless person who would qualify for benefits in either according to the above rules. B though buys them the bus ticket, sends them to A. City A then justifiably disqualifies them from benefits, as City B should never have stooped to sending them away. The homeless person returns to B (hitchhiking, hoofing it, riding the rails). City B can now disqualify them, as they have arrived from A.\n\nIf someone can formulate that a bit better to protecting against bussing without mangling the intent, say so. I'm generous with the credit.\n\nNow, with that in mind, the implementation can commence. The city that enacts these rules would need to conduct a proper census of the homeless. I'm not an expert on those (I'll leave it to the polisci nerds to have figured that out). The census should be as accurate as possible, and should pre-assess (when practical) whether the homeless person qualifies and by what rules. But also if they do not qualify, which rule is the closest to allowing them to qualify.\n\nYou see, if the example city has 500 homeless and only 320 of them qualify with the rules as I've written them, then the rules need to be adjusted. They need to be adjusted permissively to qualify all 500 people, or if that's not really possible, then at least 95% of them (very little wiggle room on that number). The nature of each rule wouldn't change, but the numbers can be adjusted to be more permissive... rule one would be adjusted to be \"6 months of the past 2 years\", if that will bump the 320 up to 460. Similar modifications of the other rules would be acceptable, in whatever combination gets them to within a few percent of the total.\n\nOnce these adjustments were made, no further modifications should be acceptable if those are less permissive. Having modified the second rule to be \"8 years of 18 as a child\", it is not morally acceptable to change it to \"16 of 18 years\" a decade later.\n\nAs for actual qualification, that's a function of wonderful red-tape bureaucracies for others to figure out. Probably enough paperwork that if the trees had been made into lumber instead that could have built sufficient housing to solve the problem. Social workers would be involved, obviously, but government seems to have already settled all the basic questions as to what evidence is sufficient (for example, I imagine arrest records for the homeless would establish when they were inhabiting the city for rule #1).\n\nIf most or all local governments were to implement these rules in good faith, it's still possible that some homeless people would qualify in none of them. Within the United States, I suggest that these people should be a problem for either the state governments to solve or perhaps the Federal government. \n\nI wish I had better ideas on how the problem of homelessness itself might be solved, but that's beyond me. As a libertarian I'm supposed to chirp \"free market yay!\" or some such other bullshit, but I haven't chugged enough koolade to believe that would actually solve the problem. I have no good ideas. This, however, is a good way to determine just which local governments are responsible for any given homeless person and I think that might make a difference.",
