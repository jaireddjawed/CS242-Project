Not gonna delete the entire question to avoid confusion with people who already took guesses. Apologies for the mistake i should have checked my riddle for errors one more time than i did. (Maybe the rhyme and wordplay scheme was a little ambitious for a beginner)\n\nAnyhow- fixed it now i think. So the riddle has a VALID solution and what was a close guess before is still close to the solution now. I know the second part was rather drastically restructured  but the underlying idea of the riddle remains the same. So here goes:\n\nSecond part:\n\nI'd already advanced to ask for a solution. But before passing on to this riddles conclusion: I have found that after a second inspection, the old form of this riddle was in need of correction.\nThis pleb here is sorry for all guesses wasted- with uploading this i should have just waited.

Its cold out there. \n2) Absolutely NO DIGGING required EVER !! \n3) Absolutely no CLIMBING required EVER !! \n4) We will NEVER put you in harms way .. ie nothing by the river (or water ) nothing in the middle of roads or on highways!! \n5) No climbing on buildings, over fences, and if there is a keep out or no trespassing sign ... you probably should not bother to look there !! ( ie not on private property)\n\nCLUES!!!\n\nCLUE #1\nThe Key chain is out there already waiting to be turned in.\nYou will find the key chain between something living and something that dyes!\n---location is in  saskatoon SK, canada\n\nCLUE #2\nLast year we talked of a circle of rest, 50 paces from there it did lay. However we noticed that circle was boring and hid it near circles of play!\n---last year it was 50 paces from a restroom near the river surrounded by trees. this year my guess it's near a play ground or near a baseball diamond,\n\nCLUE #3\nYou wont have to search on a lake or a by-land, \nI stood there behind and noticed a diamond!\n---what's a \"by-land\" google was no help; diamond is probably referring to a baseball diamond\n\nCLUE #4\nIf you Parked on the road no luck you would have.\nWe decided to make a visual clue, to keep this contest fresh,\nget out your maps and find my outline and you will get close to the stash ! (Look at picture 3 ) \n---visual clue https://imgur.com/a/rYh4zyW\n---here it is on the map https://goo.gl/maps/Rkai5Yy4Gqp Ive looked in all the parks where the red arrow was pointing to but I couldn't find anything\n\nCLUE #5\nI will never be found on private grounds, so please respect the land !! \nFoxtrot, India, November, Delta. Tango, Hotel, Echo. Sierra, Alfa, Delta, Delta, Echo, Sierra, Tango. o-o, ---, -o-o, -o-\n---decoded: FIND THE SADDEST RSCK. no clue what rsck is though\n\nCLUE #6 The Story:\nThe time is NOW said Hugh Jackman: \nbut was it:\n\n6:00 am or 6:00 pm or was it 6:15 for all he knew it could have been 930, but probably closer to 6:15. Although, if it was 9:30, the 6:15 train would not arrive until 9:45 if it even came at all. The crazy 6:15 train would NOT arrive at 9:45!\n\nAt 3:00 he noticed on the movie he was watching with Nicole Kidman, something about a witch casting a spell at a quarter to one. Or was it the Devil himself mister 666. That spell was cast as 12:45 the six stones were placed at the zero hour and Heath Ledger was trapped in a bubble. It took 1215 angels 645 hours to set him free!\n\nThe Zero hour was the name of a play I directed with 6 wonderful actors. 3 of them were male and 9 of them were female. That does not add up. Sorry if I am confusing the issue, I am not sure if it was 6 after all. In the Zero hour 3 of the actors were male and 9 were female. I have done it again. Maybe there were more than 315 males .. there may have been 9 females though, yes of that I am certain!\n\n---I have no idea how to decipher this\n\nCLUE #7\n\nIn all the world I did not think this still would not been found. \nTo find and reach the chain you need to be sly as a fox\nThe chain is not naked this year, but also not in a box.\nThis next clue will be times two, there's more things to decode\na helpful hint for clue 6 will also be told.\n\nonly a certain few have solved clue 6 as hard as it may be\n30 circles will surely help and make it ten by three.\n\nlove puzzles as much as us? Please do come on down, with 6 different escape rooms now, one for you can be found.\n\nlisten closely to these words and maybe I'll be true, that they will be hard to read oh what a thing to do.\n\neven simple things on here, as little as they seem, can be solved to give you an advantage for your team.\n\nyou will be closer only if you think about a song, did I include some lyrics somewhere hidden all along?\n\n---I don't know what to make of this either\n",

This one seemed to have people who would best be able to help!\n\nAs the title suggests, I'm participating in a scavenger hunt that takes place over an entire county. The way the hunt works is that the hosts put out 3 clues, each clue leading to a location with a different QR code. Each QR code links to a youtube video with a new clue. The clues from the youtube video lead you to find the location and access code for a safe. There are first comers prizes in each of the three safes, but two have already been found. Each safe also contains a clue to help find the \"Golden G\" which when found can be turned in for a reward. \n\n\nMy group has successfully found the first and second safe, but need help being the first group to find the third. The clue that was given for QR code #3 was a single picture. I linked the picture below. We have nothing else to go on other than that picture. \n\n\nPicture: https://imgur.com/YVeLljD\n\n\nThe hunt takes place in Utah County, Utah. The company that is hosting the scavenger hunt is a local escape room company. \n\n\nWhat we know about the picture:\n\n* The picture was taken in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, South Africa. \n\n* The picture went viral on Reddit and Twitter with the caption \"Who's playing Jumanji?\"\n\n* The picture originally posted online two years ago was 900x900, when the company uploaded it, they cropped it to 750x450\n\n* The Lion's name is Columbus, and is a tame lion from a South African lion preserve being used in a film production. \n\n\nWe've scouted out a bunch of leads but everything has led to a dead end so far. \n\nAnyone have any ideas on how to go about interpreting the picture?",
