He tells me he doesn't know and I should look it up on their web site.\n\nLater, when I did, I find most every location in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area was hit.  \n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that with most every restaurant in a major population center having been hit, the manager doesn't know if his was hit.\n\nA customer might elect to pay with cash that day, for example, or they might even decide not to eat there.\n\nBut, we've frequented this place since our honeymoon 8 years ago.  If anything is going to prompt me from going there, it isn't a credit card hack.  It's them not being up front about it.",

        "text": "So this past Christmas I got a couple gift cards to a fast-casual type Mexican restaurant that's very popular. Both of them $10. There was no food in the house (watching my parent's house while they're on vacation) so I decide to go there twice over the course of the weekend. No regrets.\n\n\nI'm there on my second trip, one gift card has like $1 left on it, the other one is still full. The restaurant is not really busy at all, it's about 2PM on a Sunday. I pay for my meal with the first one, still have a balance to pay, and hand the cashier my second gift card.\n\n\nShe takes my gift card, pauses, looks up at me, and says in I swear the most judgmental, sarcastic tone ever, \"OKAY then\". I even asked for no receipt. \n\n\nI was hungry and just wanted my food so I didn't even respond. But really? Don't plenty of people pay with more than one gift card?\n\n\nLater my boyfriend said I should have said \"Oh, I hope that second card swipe didn't wear you out!\" lol.",

        "text": "First time posting here. You know the drill.\n\nI was with my brother at $retailStore a little while ago, browsing the toy section with him while the rest of the family looked for dog food and other necessities. It kept him occupied, and I'm like 10 years old on the inside anyway.\n\nThis was a little later in the day, and as we were looking at various Lego sets and Nerf knockoffs (BuzzBee can suck it), we also noticed that a whole bunch of different packages were ripped open, mainly Minecraft figures. Upon closer inspection, we realized that there were even bigger things ripped open and thrown under the displays, including a toy gun.\n\nI don't think anything was really stolen, but I figured someone from the staff may want to know about it. I found a very nice younger gentleman we'll call $steve. We showed him some of the smaller ripped-up stuff and directed him to the affected aisles. We started talking about the situation (paraphrasing of course, this was a few months back):\n\n&gt; $me: \"Kinda stupid that this stuff happens.\"  \n&gt; $steve: \"This is because night staff doesn't do their job.\"\n\nThough I haven't had a real retail job, I've read enough TFR to know that this wasn't *completely* accurate. As he was walking away, I made a final remark:\n\n&gt; $me: \"No, it's because parents don't know how to watch their children.\"\n\nHe looked back at me. He seemed pretty glad to hear that.\n\n&gt; $steve: \"I'm not supposed to say that, but yes. Thank you.\"\n\nAnd with that said, we both continued on with their days. I still go to $retailStore pretty regularly and I usually try to tell someone if I see that stuff.\n\n**TL;DR: Parents, watch your kids. It's not the employees' jobs to babysit/clean up the boxes they ripped open.**",

        "text": "Earlier today, I ran out of gas. Without any money, trusted family to call, or friends in the area, I lurched into the parking lot of a so-very-common pharmacy and contemplated what to do and where to go.\n\nAfter writing a brief explanatory note that I placed under the windshield wiper, I entered the pharmacy to inform the manager of my situation. A manager or supervisor (which appears to me a difference in mere title but to him an apparent difference in status) was called up front, and I told him of my situation.\n\nCurt and offering the minimal assistance, the supervisor stated that I have 24 hours before the car will be towed. I informed him that I would call my insurance provider before another full day passes. I had just called the insurance provider (thank you, you generous reptilian provider... despite your bill) the day before for assistance, so I have been apprehensive about calling them again. I worry that my insurance rates would increase as a result, though perhaps it's an unfounded concern.\n\nDespite my assurance that the car would not be towed immediately, the supervisor continued with his abrasive tone. He wrote down my information, including the time (in case 24 hours passes so that the car will be towed).\n\nAfter the supervisor took my information, I kindly requested that he write and sign another piece of paper stating the same thing so that I would have a record of the pharmacy's policy. At this point, the supervisor became angered that I would ask for his name. He said that he, a supervisor and representative of the pharmacy, would not put his name behind what he stated. I responded by simply stating that it was for my own record and that I would never take issue (up the chain of command) with his help. Oddly enough, this angered the supervisor (who informed me that he's not a manager but a supervisor and that, essentially, a customer should know the difference and use the \"right\" label when addressing him) and he threatened to call the cops.\n\nWhich he did.\n \nDespite bearing myself as a man currently living out of his car and in need of help from nice people, the supervisor was threatened by my desire to know with whom I was speaking. He called the cops who later stopped me as I was walking around with a box of powdered food that I hoped either to sell or to give away in return for some gas or a hot shower.\n\nFortunately, the cops were understanding and offering of advice to further me along my journey toward the crossroad. The ones I have been skeptical of the most turned out to be the ones assisting me the most. The one I placed my trust in to provide soothing medicine in time of need turned out to be the one instigating the most discomfort.\n\nWhat is this fear in people that leads them to fearing those asking for just a little help and perhaps a bowl of warm soup? Most of all, what is this fear in people that leads them to fear helping the fellow man as he would want to be helped?\n\nNo, this one supervisor is not emblematic of all supervisors at this corporate pharmacy. Of course not. However, I do fear that this one supervisor is emblematic of the direction of this country.\n\nNow *that* scares me.\n\nBut I fear only One.\n",

I went to the store after work for just one quick thing. They didn't have the exact one I wanted, so I was standing there trying to decide which one to get instead. I noticed an employee standing behind me stocking the other side of the aisle. I turned and smiled at him and then went back to contemplating. He said\n\n\"I wish I had a real job like you.\"\n\nI was very taken aback by that comment and asked what he meant by it.\n\nHe kind of stuttered a bit and said \"You know. Because you're dress so nice. So you work in an office and probably make great money.\"\n\n(I do work in an office building and I don't dress super nice, but I do adhere to the 'business casual').\n\nMe - \"Well, I work in a call center. It's not glorious getting yelled at by angry people on the phone all day. Trust me.\"\n\nHim - \"It's better than doing this\" He gestured to the boxes he was working on\n\nMe - \"To be honest with you, I used to work at a grocery store stocking shelves. I liked that JOB way better than this one. Yeah, the pay is better now and the work environment and hours are more consistent, but the job itself? No, I much prefer stocking shelves.\"\n\nHe laughed \"Really?? Wanna trade?\"\n\nMe - \"No... But we are hiring like crazy right now.\" I told him the website to go apply and general rundown of the application process.\n\nHe looked like I had handed him a winning lottery ticket.\n\nI sighed and said \"A job is a job. And not every job is for everyone.\"\n\nI grabbed what I was going to buy and left.\n\nIt's amazing how little retail employees think of themselves and their jobs. No, the job is not glorious, but it's important. I'm not saying I would like to make a career out of stocking shelves, but I genuinely liked my job at the grocery store. It was decent money and honest work. It kept me in pretty good shape and I worked at a \"good for you\" kind of store, so I ate really well and cooked at home more often when I work there. I met some really awesome people and had some amazing coworkers while I worked there. Don't get me wrong, I understand the retail life. I promise. But the job itself is really not bad.",

        "text": "This spring a new place opened up in our small town of off Lake Michigan. I went with friends and it was really pleasant. Plenty of managers as well as  the owner were walking around to ensure happy guests. There was a place for playing bags. There was great beer selection and the food was good. And to top it all off, the building was AWESOME! It was an old farm \"resto-mod\" that kept the rustic feeling of the barn with modern features and cleanliness.\n\nI just revisited this winter. It's been hard to get there because  they are only open Friday and Saturday. Weird, but whatever. \n\nTo start off we are seated and are asked what we want to drink. I ask for a beer menu. *Strike 1*, no beer menu. I ask our server if they have an IPA. *Strike 2*, she has no idea what beer they have but they have bud light, and something local. I order the local beer. *Strike 3* I forgot that since they are hardly open the keg lines aren't clean or fresh. The beer kinda sucks. \n\n*Strike 4* we realize we are cold and the other group in our little area has their coats on. \n\n*Strike 5* We look up and realize that this place is too lazy to close the windows at the top of the barn. Yes, you'd need a tall ladder, yes you'd have to unscrew the speaker some dumbass installed in the way of the window, but it would take an hour *tops*. \n\n*Strike 6* Waitress hands us paper menus. She informs us that basically half of the menu is not available tonight. \n\n*Strike 7* on the menu it says \"We will be closed for February\" (and get this..) \"We return March 25th\"\n\nBITCH thats not just February...that's Feb. and March for fucks sake!\n\n*Strike 8* I get a burger that is cooked to perfection and juicy, but the toppings are useless. It is their signature burger named after the restaurant and it is supposed to have this white paprika sauce. They put barely any on there, and even the amount on there was not even flavorful. So close to being good but the toppings were a let down. \n\n*Strike 9* My friend got habenaro wings. He wanted buffalo, but out of their 7 wing flavors there was no buffalo...\n\n*Strike 10*  They served them as a basket of dry wings next to a pitifully small cup of habenero sauce. WTF? Who serves wings like this...and if you do at least make the sauce cup something they can comfortably dip into. However, similar to the burger, the wings were actually cooked perfect and were juicy, just the fixings fell apart. \n\n*Strike 11* I tried the sauce and it wasn't even mild heat. It was a sugar sauce. It literally tasted like someone knocked granulated sugar into it and didn't want to get in trouble so they left it as is. \n\n\n**Important takeaway!**- We both realized that we could fix this place in basically a day. They need a competent owner/manager.\n\n1- Print a damn beer menu, come on. They had a selection of about 8 beers, that calls for a drink menu. And train your staff on it. \n\n2- Clean your keg lines. \n\n3- Close the damn windows. You are wasting heat, and your customers are uncomfortable. Yes it might be a bit hard to reach but that is no excuse.\n\n4- Trim items off the menu.  Instead of making your servers/customers try to navigate the menu and remember what is available that night, print off a sheet of the actual updated menu. \n\n5- \n\n6- Update your sauces. Be honest about how they taste, feel free to order from outside too. Also add buffalo as a flavor for wings...I mean you have parmesean garlic and no buffalo? wtf. \n\n7- Oh yeah, when someone gets wings, toss them in the sauce. They aren't chicken nuggets. \n\n***TL;DR*** Restaurant is so close to being really good, just a few problems could be fixed and the place could be an amazing addition to the town. ",

        "text": "(posted this once before^i^shadow-banned)\n\nAs many people who have had their wisdom teeth removed, post-operation you is not always on top of it. For one, you are high as James Franco and Seth Rogen whenever they try to pop out one of their movies. And for another - well, mostly the first one. Yeah, definitely the first one.\n\nThis is my story.\n\nTen minutes after my operation, I persuade (\"Daaaaaddddd comeeeee onnnnnnn\") my dad that I need hangers from this dollar store down the street ASAP. Not entirely convinced, he takes me to the store anyways. When he's parked, he tries to talk me out of going but I am convinced that I am in tip-top shape. I am ready to arm wrestle a bear and make his mother a nice dinner. I am ready to eat a stack of pencils like a true delinquent and hold those really hot massage rocks (I relay this all to my father with an intense spaghetti motion of my arms). That ready. So I jump out the car and stumble to the store with my cash in hand.\n\nWhile perusing my possible clothing supporters, I tilt my head down to debate the positives and the negatives of felt versus plastic hangers. As I'm looking, I realize that small coin-sized drops of blood have been dropping from my mouth and onto the linoleum floor. \n\nPanicked and slightly delirious, I grab the first hangers I can reach for and rush for the cash register. There is a lone worker standing there, and as he sees me running up (aka, swerving around like a floppy overcooked noodle) he looks extremely bewildered. I try to flash him a smile to ease his nerves as I slam my hangers on the counter cause I'm suave like that, but mostly I showed him a gaping maw full of bloody cotton balls that probably looked like the entrance to the fifth ring of hell. As I speak to him, there is a slight gurgle and slur to my words because blood is starting to well in the back of my mouth.\n\n **Me**: *Heeyyyyyy*, how's it going, man? I gotta - uh, got a little blood on the floor in the back (here I flail my arm in swooping direction that basically points to the whole store), sorry. Hope it's not dried. \n\n **Him**: Are you... okay?\n\n **Me**: *Whaaaa*-aaat???? I'm like... super duper. Fine as hell. *flashes him a thumbs up and maybe a shaka, brah* Thanks, man, and sorry about the blood. \n\nSo then I walk out of the store with my stuff, feeling great and on top of my A-game. 10/10 shit here - this tooth removal stuff can't hold me down. I'm swinging around the parking lot until I finally get to the car. Immediately my straight-faced dad stares at me, motions to my face, and says I've got a little \"something.\" \n\nConfused, I pull down the mirror and see that I am COVERED in blood. It looks like a B-grade camp horror film has just taken a huge low-budget shit all over me. It looks like I had just stuck the lower half of my face in a vat of watery ketchup and lost the fight. Like a baby vampire who just had their first taste of blood and couldn't contain themselves. There is a stream of blood running down my throat and onto my shirt and my hair has fallen out of my bobby-pins and is doing their best overturned haystack impression. \n\n\"Oh,\" I say. *\"Oh.\"*\n\nLooking back, I really want to apologize for freaking out a normal guy just trying to do his job - It's not everyday you deal with a crazy blood-soaked weirdo.\n\n(I haven't seen him at the store since.)",

As I'm going through the parking lot this woman calls me over. I usually at least hear people out so I go over to her.\n\n&gt;Woman: Excuse me, do you have an ID?\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry, what?\n\n&gt;Woman: Do you have an ID? I need someone to return these items for me so I can buy food for my kids and I don't have the receipt. Apparently they have limits of how much money you can get back with returns and I hit my limit last week when I returned diapers I bought for my kids.\n\nIt was at this moment I noticed that she had a number of bottles of a more expensive brand of shampoo in her arms.\n\n&gt;Me: Nope sorry.\n\nAnd I walked on. I didn't believe a word she said as I didn't believe returning diapers would hit a limit on return money (I'm assuming there's a limit to how frequently you can do it without a receipt) and if that didn't hit the limit then it just meant that she returned things a number of times for the store to put a halt to her returns. The fact they'd basically need to run my ID was sketchy enough.\n\nIn the end I was going to inform the woman that was ringing me up but the woman from the parking lot was in the store now and she was definitely within hearing range. I couldn't bring myself to just call her out and put attention on her when she was so close by so I never mentioned it.\n\nTo anyone that works retail, would you have preferred a customer to inform you about people soliciting others to do returns for them? I felt like it was something I should've brought to staff attention but me being self conscious didn't want her to hear me calling her out to an employee.",

        "text": "So, after an interesting night of almost getting run off the road and trying to squeeze a bit of time with each other on our last night off together for a while, my lady and I decided to try a bar attached to a dinning establishment. We sat in back, by the pool table, and relaxed with our beers, not paying any attention to the rather hippyish looking lady and what I can only assume was her date for the evening. As we are about half through our beers, I look over and see the hippy lady pull what looks like a huge joint out of a leather pouch on her hip and start showing it to her date, talking about energies and what not. I'm about to just chuckle at the boldness of it, and forget it, I mean, weed is all over out here and most people don't have a problem seeing it around. That is, until she takes out a lighter and lights the wrapped herbs up, waving it all around her in wide arcs until the smell hits me; it's like pissed on bed sheets and burning paper. So we take our beers up to the bartender, a young woman talking to a couple at the bar, I do my best to politely get her attention:\n\nME: \"Ma'am, the woman back there is burning something and waving it around and it smells awful, it's really making it hard to enjoy our beers.\"\n\nBARWENCH: \"Oh, she's probably just trying to improve her pool game.\"\n\nAt that point, she turns and starts talking to her friends again.\n\nMe: \"Um, ma'am, excuse me...\"\n\nOf course, she continues to ignore me, at which point I chug the last of my beer and walk out, only able to muster an unimaginative, \"Fuck me, I guess I could have had my cig right at the table, didn't realize they lifted that silly smoking ban in CA.\"\n\nI'm not really sure how bad it is, but the smoke was nasty and really made me want to vomit, my lady also has asthma and having the area fill with smoke could have been dangerous had we stayed. What was worse was the bartender having complete disregard for her customers, probably not wanting to do her job by intervening in a clearly obnoxious and probably illegal activity in progress, then ignoring me completely. Am I over reacting in being pissed with that kind of treatment? I don't think I am.",

It was a great day if my gas tank was anywhere near a quarter full. I learned $2.00 in gas could get me to school back to my house, with enough gas to spare to just barely make it to the gas station the next morning (this was when gas was over $4/gal). That's what I was putting in daily, sometimes just in handfuls of change.\n\nI was a senior at this point, and I was allowed to go off campus for lunch. I had one of my friends who wanted to come with me, but I knew I just barely made it to school that day and I was running on fumes. My friend told me no worries, she had a few bucks to spare, so off we went to grab a few caffeine laden beverages for her and gas for me.\n\nMy friend found out once we got there that she accidentally left her wallet in her locker.\n\n Fuck.\n\nWell, luckily I had an old prepaid Amex in my wallet that I knew had a little over a buck on it. That would get us back to school at least. So I hand it to the clerk..\n\n\"Sorry, we don't take Amex here.\"\n\nFuck.\n\nSo I start digging through my purse and my friend does the same to find any kind of change. We come up with maybe 14 cents. Not gonna work.\n\nSuddenly the lady behind us goes \"put this $20 on her pump\". I almost didn't pay attention at first, not expecting any kindness. But eventually I looked up and see this older woman smiling at me. All I could squeak out was \".. For me? I would only need a couple bucks..\"\n\n\"I was your age once. Gas is worth its weight in gold. Don't worry about it.\"\n\nI literally starting tearing up and gave her a hug. Even the clerk was surprised. That act of kindness has never left me and has always been an influence on me. I didn't have to worry about gas for over a week! So thank you Random Gas Station Lady, I hope your act of kindness has been paid back to you tenfold.\n",

I’ll pay for separately for the other cup.”\n\n“I’ll give you the senior discount since it was my mistake.”\n\nShe gives me another medium cup, and charges $1.\n\n“Ah, I’m OK with the price, it’s what I paid before, but I thought you were giving me a senior discount?”\n\n“Oh, I did. Check your receipt. Before, you ordered a small, which is $1. We gave you the medium cup because we don’t have small cups.

        "text": "This happened a week ago and it still just aggravates me. I was at a store that sells mainly food items and then a rotating stock of products based on the season (for instance, in January they sell fitness accessories and snow shovels).\n\nI am in the product aisle and I go to the clearance section. In the clearance section they have all of the toys that they didn't sell from Christmas time. I see 3 products by the same brand: A doll high chair, a doll stroller, and a doll play pen. They were originally $7.99, but now the price sign reads \"$1.49 clearance\". I picked up a play pen because...for $1.49 why not? My daughter already has a doll high chair and stroller, so the play pen was all we really had use for. (The box on this toy reads: Play Pen. This information is important for later)\n\nWhen we check out, the cashier rings up the play pen and I check my receipt. It says \"$4.99\" was charged for the play pen. I walked back to the cashier (they don't have a customer service area at this store) and tell her that I was overcharged for this product. She didn't knowledge me but called her manager over the radio and said \"how much are these doll play pens?\" \"$4.99\" \nI said, \"Hm. That's not what your signage says.\" \nShe really didn't say or do anything, so I walk back to the product aisle real quick, look for the sign that says \n\n**\"Doll High Chair, Doll Stroller, or Doll Play Yard - $1.49 clearance\"** \n\nI snapped a picture of it on my phone, brought it back to the cashier and said \"Okay, I'm really not trying to be a pain, but this **is** what your signage says over there.\n\nShe goes, \"Ohhh wow. okay. *pause* Oh wait, no - the sign says play yard, your box says play pen.\"\n\nMe: 0_0 \"that's the same thing...\" \n\nHer: \"No, it's a different item.\"\n\nMe: \"Then can you show me what item exactly is $1.49?\"\n\nHer: \"We've probably sold all of them.\"\n\nMe: \"So, if I go get a high chair or a stroller are they going to ring up as $1.49 or will the box say 'elevated seating arrangement' and 'manually propelled baby transporter'?\"\n\nHer: \"I'm not sure what they will ring up as.\"\n\nMe: \"...maybe you should just charge what your sign reads or change the sign.\"\n\nAt this point I take the money that she already had in her hand when I came back from double checking the signage. I could tell she really didn't care about my business and I don't raise my voice to anyone in that sort of setting so I had to remove myself from the situation before getting overwhelmed.\n\n**EDIT** So I went back to the store last night to pick up some groceries and checked to see if they still had the items and lo and behold - they did and the sign was *changed* to say $4.99. So I did have the right product and the sign did say $1.49. I realize we're talking about less than $5 but just admit you're wrong and made a mistake. Don't tell the customer that there's no way a mistake could have been made. ",

But it doesn't.  \n&gt;Clerk: It should.  \n&gt;Me: You're welcome to try and prove me wrong, if you like.  \nClerk: It's got a thread.  \n&gt;Me: Yes, I know. But the problem is, it doesn't twist. It doesn't turn, it seems to be stuck.  \n&gt;Clerk: Have you tried using tools?  \n&gt;Me: Yes. I have. But it doesn't matter which part you hold on to and which part you twist, it doesn't budge. It seems to have some sort of residue here. I'm not too sure if that's normal or if they used some sort of adhesive when they put it together...?  \n&gt;Clerk: They shouldn't have used adhesive.  \nMe: Well, I don't know if they did. But if they did, it'd explain why its stuck, wouldn't it? Do you think they would have?  \n&gt;Clerk: No, they shouldn't have used any.  \nMe: Do you sell the pipes just on their own?  \nClerk: Yes, but they're not copper any longer, they're [some bendy type]. We also sell cisterns if you wanted to grab one of those while you're here. [*grabs one of each and puts them on the counter*]  \nMe: No thanks, I don't need a new one, I just need to remove this pipe from the old one. It's the one thing stopping me from installing the new one. The one which I've already bought. And am this close to installing.  \nClerk: And you've definitely tried unscrewing it?  \nMe: How much does the new pipe cost?  \nClerk: OK. [*type type type*] [*type type type*] [*type type type*] $5.95.  \nMe: Done. Sold. I'll take it.\n\nDid I try turning it? \"Oh gee, what a great idea!\"",

Now I didn't grow up with video games in the house. I'm 25 so this is a bit odd since all my friends had them but I was mostly raised by my grandparents and then my aunt and uncle after they became too old to take care of me. Not technology loving people I was lucky to get a computer in high school and that was only after a friend of my uncle pointed out I would need one for almost anything homework wise since times had changed. All this to say tech is a very special thing for me to own. I have slowly been upgrading my stuff over the last year so I can complete my degrees in college. New Mac book pro for classes, new smart phone since we don't have Internet at home but I have unlimited data. and this semester I didn't have to buy any books because of upperclassmen friends who are letting me use their stuff. \n\nSo I took the money I would have spent on my books and bought my very first gaming console. A Wii U and got a couple games for it got it home and hooked up. Then the problem started. The controller wouldn't stay connected. I would be half way through a race and no connection. Kept driving into and off stuff. Moved the sensor bar the couch the TV everything! Nothing helped. Went back to the store today hoping they might have an idea.\n\nThey did. Told me it was probably the sensor bar itself and asked me to just bring the bar and the receipt back and they would exchange it no problem. They also told me that if that didn't work they would exchange the whole consol. Got home hooked the new bar up and... YES IT WORKS! WOOT! The employees were awesome and I will definitely be shopping there for future games and other gaming related stuff.",

        "text": "I‘ve gotten three voice mails (and multiple calls that didn’t result in voice mail messages) this week from a company that apparently provides various web services (content publishing, site design) that I have never done business with.  It seemed like the company needed feedback from the customer in order to complete some services, so after the third call, I called back.  \n\nI navigated the menu to the best of my ability - not being a customer.  I let the rep know that I was getting calls because they  have a wrong telephone number in their records.  The agent told me that she couldn’t remove the number because there is not another number listed for the customer.  I recommended that she remove my phone number since I am not the account holder and put a note in to contact that client by another method (e.g. email) until the phone number is updated.  She asked me to hold because she needed to speak with her supervisor.  She wasn’t entirely sure how to handle it.  She explained that the phone number field is required by her system, so she can’t just remove the number.  \n\nHaving worked in the customer service arts &amp; sciences for most of my career (i.e., I have worked as an agent, but also as a system admin for multiple call center software packages), I understand required fields and agent rules, so this was not a problem for me.  It's worth my time to have my phone number removed from their system and to let the support folks who were trying to reach the client know that they're not going to get any feedback from this number.\n\nEight minutes later, she transferred me to the supervisor.  This woman was so rude!  Either the original rep didn’t explain the problem properly or the manager wasn’t actually listening to her.  I am guessing it was the 2nd, since I had to explain multiple times that I am NOT the account holder, yet have been getting multiple calls from their company.  At one point she said, “Well, If you don’t have an account, how on earth did you get the number to call us?”  I held back my sarcastic tongue and calmly said, “It was in one of the voice mail messages left at my phone number. It was someone named Xxxxxx who was looking for feedback from the customer on a service that's been performed. I thought someone should know that calling my number isn’t going to get that feedback since I am not your customer.  I suspect your actual customer is eager to work with your team and is concerned that they haven’t heard from your company for several days.”\n\nApparently she didn’t like that.  She seemed to be insisting that I must have something to do with this account if they have my phone number in their system. She started giving me details about the client seeing if it “rings a bell” (she provided me much more information about the account than would have made me happy if I were the customer and a stranger was calling about my account!). Each time I said I'd never heard of the (company, client, web address), it sounded like she was grunting in disbelief. I don't know how else to describe the sound she made.  I told her I’ve never heard of their company before (grunt), or the company that opened the account (grunt). I told her I do not require any site design or content publishing. When she said, \"You MUST have worked for them. Maybe they changed company names after you left, but you're still on the account.\" I advised that I've worked for the same company for 15 years and that this phone number is a personal cell phone which has never been associated with a business.  I've had the number for over a decade.  She grunted at me again.  I was trying to remain professional, but the repetitive guttural sounds made me a little irritable.  \n\nI went on the offensive and started insisting that someone must have typed it wrong in their system.  I asked if she could just replace the phone number with all 9’s or something to make the system happy.  She said she couldn’t do that, so they’ll keep my number until they get an updated one. That was my final straw... I told her that was not appropriate, since I am not and have never been an account holder.  She said she would “try” to get it fixed but didn't think it was possible until they got an accurate number.  I should have told her that I would start making the account decisions next time I get a call, since she couldn't be bothered to remove my information from the account.\n\nI’ve gotten two more calls since then, but no more voice mail messages. (I wasn’t able to answer either time because I was on a phone call for work.)\n\nIt honestly shouldn't be this difficult to call a company and say, \"Hey, you have a wrong number for your customer.\"  I shouldn't be grunted at and I DEFINITELY shouldn't be given account information when I'm claiming NOT to be the account holder.  I know that if I ever do need the type of services this company offers, I won't be giving them my money.  How could I ever trust that they wouldn't give out my details if an incorrect phone number ended up in my account records?\n\nI needed to vent about this experience somewhere.  My Facebook friends are sick of hearing my complaints about the sorry state of the service industry.  :)  Thanks for having this sub when I needed it. \n",

        "text": "**Background**\n\nI work as an Independent IT Contractor (read: fancy word for freelance tech support) for a very broad range of things including hardware repair for consumer electronics like desktops, phones, and game systems. I also like to tinker around with my own electronics and have a much different approach for client devices and personal devices.\n\nWhen working on client devices, I go above and beyond including anti-static gloves, wrist straps, high powered flash lights, magnifying glasses (because god only knows how bad my vision really is), and an utmost level of care to ensure safe, precise, and accurate work. When working on my own things, my level of cautiousness rivals that of a toddler who has just discovered a hammer for the first time when his parent's aren't around.\n\nThis is a story about how me acting as a self proclaimed IT wizard decided to completely disregard the IT professional who I contacted for help.\n\n-\n\n**Story Time**\n\nA busy semester in school saw me not giving my portable game system (PGS) much love, despite it living in my backpack every day. Now, one of the notorious problems with this type of PGS, especially ones that get jarred around sitting in things like backpacks, is that the wireless card likes to loosen up. This means any time you try to connect to WiFi, the system will crash. When this happens you simply open it up, plug the wireless card back in, and voila. Problem solved.\n\nAfter three months of no use, I turned it on to see this all-but-trademarked issue and knew what was wrong. I had a problem though, I couldn't for the life of me remember what screw driver I needed. Those little guys were so tiny that my horrible eyes couldn't even take a good guess. The internet yielded mixed answers, so I thought, \"I'll just call PGS Tech Support and ask them!\" \n\n&gt; **PGS Tech Support Guy (PTSG)**: Thank you for calling PGS Tech Support, how can I help you?\n\n&gt; **Me**: My PGS is crashing any time it connects to the internet.\n\n*Queue 5 minutes of generic first level tech support of \"Did you try turning it off and on again\" type solutions*\n\n&gt; **PTSG**: Well it seems this problem isn't something we can help you with over the phone, so you will probably need to send it in for repairs.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Well I think the wireless card may be loose, and I'd like to check that first before sending it in. Do you know what screwdriver is used to open it?\n\n*Coming from IT, I can already hear the hesitation in his voice that he doesn't want me to do the thing I'm about to do.*\n\n&gt; **PTSG**: Umm.. The PGS you have should use a 00 sized phillips... but this may void your warranty. I... uh...  recommend sending it in for repairs just in case.\n\n*Me, being in the state of mind of self-proclaimed IT wizard, especially since this was my personal hardware, was determined. I also know they don't want to accept responsibility for people like me.*\n\n&gt; **Me**: I understand and I accept responsibility for what happens, but I'd still like to try this. Can you hold for one moment while I try this?\n\n&gt; **PTSG**: .. umm.. yeah I can hold. We're not allowed to help you over the phone with hardware repairs like this though, so I still highly recommend sending it in for repairs.\n\n*I can only think what's going through this guys head at the moment, \"Abandon ship, abandon ship...\"*\n\n*So I take to quickly removing the battery, removing the screws, taking off the plate covering the PCB, and there she blows. A completely disconnected wireless card.*\n\n&gt; **Me**: I think I was right, the wireless card is completely unplugged, let me just plug this back in and turn it on so we can wrap up this call.\n\n&gt; **PTSG**: .. ok\n\n*This guys patience was very impressive by the way.*\n\n*So the PGS turns on, connects to wireless, and immediately starts updating. Success.... almost.*\n\n&gt; **Me**: It turned back on and is updating. Thank you very much for your help\n\n&gt; **PTSG**: Pardon me asking, but how did you put the PGS back together that quickly?\n\n&gt; **Me**: Oh, I didn't, it's still mostly disassembled.\n\n*Queue panic.*\n\n&gt; **PTSG**: PLEASE don't do that, that's very dangerous and you could damage the hardware or hurt yourself...\n\n&gt; **Me**: It's OK, I'll just put it back together now.\n\nSo here's the point where the difference in safety between client and personal devices really pans out. As I'm saying this on the phone, I was putting in one of the screws that holds the plate to the PCB, and used a liberal amount of force to help not strip the screw. Well the good news is, I did not strip the screw. In fact, I completely missed the screw.\n\nIf you don't know much about 00 sized phillips, they are very thin and very pointy. You can imagine liberal force behind a long pin-point metal object is not unlike a nail being hammered into wood. Except instead of wood, it was the systems PCB. \n\n&gt; **Me**: Oh ****.\n\n&gt; **PTSG**: Pardon?\n\n&gt; **Me**: What kind of replacement policies do you have for physically damaged PGS's?\n\ntl;dr: In the confines of my home and against better judgement of the IT professional I contacted for help, [my IT wizardry seems to be specialized in destructive magic.](http://puu.sh/mAPx5/3a4b95f458.jpg)",

        "text": "So I thought this was pretty funny, although it was mildly annoying at the same time.\n\nWent to a bagel shop this morning. Ordered a bagel sandwich and a coffee.  The cashier rings me up, but then a moment later tells me they are out of the ingredients for the sandwich I ordered and ask if I wanted something else, so I tell her that is no problem and order a different sandwich.  The sandwich I ordered was cheaper, so I stand there expecting her to initiate a refund on the difference.\n\n&gt; Cashier: You're sandwich will be ready soon (she says this with the polite \"okay move now I need to ring up other customers\" look)\n\n&gt; Me: Well what about my refund?\n\n&gt; Cashier: But you picked another sandwich sir, we can't refund you.\n\n&gt; Me: No, the sandwich I picked is cheaper.\n\n&gt; Cashier: *looks at prices* But you ordered a coffee and bagel.\n\n&gt; Me: Yes\n\n&gt; Cashier: But there is tax sir.\n\n&gt; Me: Yea...\n\n&gt; Cashier: So you don't want the sandwich anymore?\n\n&gt; Me: No I do. But I paid for the other sandwich first, which you're out of, and ordered a different sandwich. So I need the difference. \n\n&gt; Cashier: Sir they are the same price, the difference is tax.\n\nThe sandwiches were over a dollar different, also...wat? By this time the manager came over so I just spoke with her.\n\n&gt; Me: Hi, I paid for a sandwich that was 5.49, but then was told you're out of it, and ordered the sandwich that was 3.99 (show receipt)\n\n&gt; Manager: Oh no problem! \n\nThe manager then refunds the original sandwich plus tax then charges me for the new sandwich and I get my refund. She apologizes and I tell her no worries.\n\nNow this place gives you a coffee cup, which you fill up on your own. So I stand there another second, expecting my coffee cup.\n\n&gt; Cashier: (gives me another \"okay get out of my line\" look)\n\n&gt; Me: I just need my coffee cup.\n\n&gt; Cashier: But I saw she didn't ring you up for a coffee.\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah, she only refunded the sandwich, you charged me for the coffee.\n\n&gt; Cashier: Sir I saw her...(she says as if she caught me trying to trick her)\n\nSo I show her my receipts, showing I was never refunded for the coffee, and at this point I finally got a little annoyed. Assuming I actually was refunded on the coffee, why didn't she stop the manager from doing so to remind them i ordered one. Or sinply remind her to add coffee on the other transaction?  Somehow in her mind it was okay to be consciously aware of what I ordered, but deliberately ensure I don't get it.\n\nShe didn't really look at the receipts but must have gave up and then just handed me a coffee cup.\n\n",

Now this store had a huge selection. There were probably about 300 pops in the store and with the way they are organized and stocked it would have taken me forever to find a certain figure I was looking for, if it was even there at all. So instead of pilfering through all of them I thought I'd ask the store if they even had any, bringing along a similar figure to show them in case they didn't know exactly what I was looking for. I make my way up to the counter where I was greeted with the ever so enthused faces of 3 employees. I ask them if they could check their stock for the figure which showing them the similar one. The shortest one said \"aren't those two basically just the same one?\" with a bit of attitude in her voice but nothing to get worked up over. I told her that while they do look similar they are still different and I wanted the one I was asking about. As it turns out though they have 1 in stock. I look back over at huge stack of 300+ figures and say \"good luck finding that one I guess.\" Just joking a bit to ease the tension because it was obvious by now that they were annoyed by me just being there. Then the meanest looking one stamps the figure I used a reference down on countertop and says \"just hurry up.\" I know I may sound like I'm making a big deal over nothing and maybe I am but having worked in retail before I know how it can be but there's no reason to be rude to a customer.

All is well except when I get a call from his boss who wants to let him know his houses tomorrow have been changed. (He works home health care and sometimes the clients call canceling a bath or what ever they have set up.) I get confused but the boss has my number too since one of his old phones was very unreliable so I just figured he hadn't answered. So I try to call him. Busy signal. That's odd. (I'm sure most of you can gusset where this is going.) I type to text him and I receive the text. WTF? I call customer care and it turns out somehow our numbers were switched. Just the numbers not the simple cards not the phone plans (I have unlimited data he doesn't) nothing but the numbers. So I had to call his boss to let her know what's going on and we had a pretty good laugh. She did say she was confused as to why I was answering his phone when he was supposed to be at work. And just to make it better I keep texting my own number talking to him which is a very weird feeling.\n\nAlso I'm not mad at the phone guy and it should be easy enough to fix tomorrow when the store opens again lol.\n\nEdit: Update so finally figured it out. When they gave us new sim cards the numbers didn't go to the right ones lol. Quick simple fix and I learned how to download my videos to my mac so I didn't lose any of them yay!",

So I start to look at the bags and I picked up one which was particularly beautiful, I can't have been in there more than 2 minutes before a sales assistant comes right up behind me and without even saying hello or acknowledging me in anyway she says \"That one is £220, the sale bags are over there\". I couldn't believe it like I literally was so shocked, I just looked at her and said \"Right?\" and sort of awkwardly left the store, I was mortified. Now, I appreciate it may seem like I was overreacting but the tone in her voice and the pure look of judgment on her face was enough to let me know she OBVIOUSLY didn't think I could afford this bag. Granted, I was wearing a large coat and carrying a sports store bag, but how dare she. What was ironic is that I already have that bag in a different colour, and the matching purse. Bitch.\n\n",

Ultimately we got the best rate from a certain hated nation-wide cable company for a bundle that included internet, cable, and a landline. We didn't really want a home phone, but the price was still better with it included and since there was no reason we would *have* to use it I figured we were good to go. Frustratingly, they said it would take them about two weeks to get out to us, but we at least had a date and time all set up: 11:00am on a coming Tuesday.\n\nOn the day of the installation, 11:00am rolls around - no cable guy. No sweat, I think to myself. I'm an easy customer, and I'm off work today anyway. I can wait.\n\n11:30am comes. Now I'm starting to wonder...but my inner Zen master urges patience. So, again, I wait.\n\nNoon comes, I have a little lunch, and I decide enough is enough, so I call the customer service line. \"Oh, sorry, they are running just a little behind today. If you would please be patient he should be there within the hour.\"\n\nIn case you haven't picked up on it yet, I'm a pretty easygoing guy. I can wait a little longer, not a big deal in my mind. Annoying, but maybe the tech is having a worse day than I am. So...I wait.\n\n...\n\n1:00pm comes and goes. I wave as 2:00pm sails right by as well.\n\n3:00pm comes and I am done waiting. I decide its time for another call. \n\nI tell them that enough is enough, and that they need to either get their tech out to me or I'm tempted to just go with a competitor. Their response?\n\n\"Oh, I'm glad you called! The tech assigned to you has been trying to contact you all afternoon! You weren't answering your phone, so he assumed you weren't available. Let me see if there is a time to get him back out there...\"\n\nMe: \"I have been here all day with my cell phone on. I haven't gotten any calls. And why would he assume that means the appointment is cancelled?\"\n\nCS Rep: \"Well, our schedules are very busy so you do need to be available for contact. Let me see...yep, it says right here that he tried calling you at the (###) - ###-#### phone number. That is your number, correct? It has that number assigned to your address.\"\n\nMe: \"..........You mean the number that your company is providing?\"\n\nCS Rep: \"Yes, of course.\"\n\nMe: \"So, the technician who is coming to install cable, internet, and a PHONE LINE today, was trying to contact me via the PHONE LINE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO INSTALL?\"\n\nCS Rep: \"Do you have an alternate number you'd like to give that you use more often?\"\n\nMe: \"Cancel my account.\"\n\nMy next call was to a different regional provider, setting up an account and installation. They had someone out the next day - on time.",

        "text": "So me and a friend went to this bar we were regulars at about two weeks or so ago I was just reminded of it. \n\nWe were sitting at the bar watching a game. Went into like three overtimes. We were running late by the time it ended and were rushed to leave. We payed and got our change and I left just stuffing the money in my pocket. We drove twenty minutes, rushed to our meeting for an hour, and went our separate ways. \n\nWhen I got home (it had been close to three hours by this point) I took the money out of my pocket. I saw that my change was supposed to be $7 but she gave me $52 instead. Not sure how. Maybe the 5 and 50 got switched in her mind. I wasn't sure what happened but I figured I would make up for it when I went there three days later. \n\nMe and friend get there, go to our normal spot with our normal waitress. She flips out before even coming up to us. I can hear her in the back screaming. \n\n&gt; Those idiots who stole from me are back. I cant f-ing believe it. They have to be f-ing kidding me. f--k it. I am not serving them. \n\nSo another server comes over. I ask to speak with the waitress. She refuses. I say its urgent. She refuses. We order, wait. Takes close to 40 min for our food (usually takes 10 at most. Its not exactly fine dining. Its a pizza place. They just have to cut the slices.) \n\nWe see her in the kitchen pointing to us and talking to the chef. I am legit worried to eat my food. \n\nI eat it anyway, finish my drink, and try again to talk to her to give her her money back. \n\nShe refuses to leave the kitchen. In fact, when serving a different table across the room on multiple occasions I can see her pointing at us and stuff. At one point I can actually hear her say (loudly, from 6 tables over) \n\n&gt; Yeah they just stole my money and left\n\nAt this point I was absolutely done with her. \n\nWe get our bill and there is a note on it saying\n\n&gt; I better not see you in this place again. I wont be so forgiving.\n\nAnd she is staring at us thru the kitchen window. \n\nI write on the back of the bill telling her what happened after we left that day. Afterward I added\n\n&gt; We sat in your section and tried talking to you four times to give you the money back. I don't appreciate the treatment. You couldn't pay us enough to come back after the way you treated us. I am sorry you screwed up but I am more sorry you reacted like this. \n\n\nWe left after that. Have not been back since. Our group goes to another bar right next to it now. Just as good and after two weeks or so they're starting to recognize us on our way in. \n\nWhat do you all think? Was I at fault? was she? how should I have handled that?",

I just want to make sure they can't take the money back or mess with the terms or something like that.\n\n-\n-\n\n\n**Me venting: Not necessary to read below i just have to vent.**\n\nI can't even count the number of times the loan officer assured me that we only have one more item to address and we can close. The number of times he has \"verified with the underwriter\" that there were no other items, and then a week later we're still dealing with more items.\n\nThe worst part is that this bank has an exclusive agreement with the co-op so that they are the only ones who can finance this place. But during the process I found out that the minimum the bank will finance is actually $500 more than the co-op will allow you to finance. So, technically, it's impossible to actually get a loan. We've been granted a series of exceptions because, as my loan officer told me, we are the first loan to ever make it this far in the process.\n\nI've been a member of this bank for over 10 years and I'm closing my personal accounts with them as soon as this is over. \n",

Now, keep in mind that I have a phone in this country I was going to visit, so the call I made was to just see if there was any convenient offer for me to save me money in case of an emergency.\n\nI called them, and this representative told me that if i activated the basic roaming plan I was gonna pay phone calls at the same rate thats applied to me when I call abroad from the US (I think it's $0.15 a minute).\n\nI was like, fantastic! thats so great, I can use my phone when I need to! Thats is exactly what I did, I used it to coordinate with friends mostly, so very short phone calls (where are you/ what time are we meeting up) and some longer ones with my wife (one or two 20 minutes phone calls, because we facetimed over wifi mostly).\n\nEverything went well until the day I was leaving when I got a text about my charges being over 200$!\n\nI called immediately and I was told that it was not my mistake because the representative that helped me even wrote down on what he told me! \n\nI thought to myself, thank fucking god there is evidence, otherwise I was just gonna sound like a desperate person trying to get those extra charges removed.\n\nThey told me, someone will be in touch.\n\nSo, today they finally called me, and guess what?\n\nnot only, there was nothing they could do, but the only way to bring my charges down a couple of dollars was to pay for the highest roaming plan for additional 120$.\n\nI wanted to scream on the phone at the guy, but I didnt.\n\nI have had similar problems before, if it's my fault I know I have to pay..\n\nThis time is different, I feel robbed of my money and I dont understand why I have to pay for a mistake someone else made.\n\nI want to know your thoughts on this reddit, is it my fault at all? Shouldnt they have to pay for those charges? Or at least offer to reimburse the cost of the plan?\n\nAny suggestion on how to go about this?\n\nthanks\n\nUPDATE:\nThank you so much for the usueful answers and suggestions. They were very helpful.\n\nI called them three times and finally I found someone who did the right thing and actually explained me the charges! So they dropped all costs of calls for $200+. However, there was a charge for data roaming of 80$ that I am responsible for .\n\nI will have to pay that... in order to avoid that charge I would have had to lie.. \n\nSo i am ending up paying 100$ more than usual between the passport plan and the roaming charges.\n\nstill unfair, but much better than before\n\nthanks reddit!\n\n\n",

Our server couldn't have been a day over 16 and I *really* hope for his sake that he was new.  \n\nSince the meals are a bit large for my kids, we ordered one to share; a hot dog and fries, and asked him \"please add a chicken nugget\" which according to the menu is a dollar upcharge or so. He writes it all down in his little pad (with a crayon, mind you).  \n\nWhen the kids' meal comes out, it's incomplete.  \n\"Oh, we also ordered a chicken nugget\" I remind him.  \nHe stammers and throws the kitchen under the bus.  \n\"Oh, uh.. I don't know why they didn't put that on the plate.\"  \nAnd then stands there, waiting for me to prompt him. He waits silently, as if hoping that I'll say \"never mind, don't worry about it\".  \n\nInstead I ask \"Could you please go *get* it?\"  \nAnd with a half-hearted \"Oh, uh.. um, yeah, yes right away.\" he was off into the kitchen.  \nFive minutes later, when we start to wonder what's going on, he returns.  \n\"Um.. sir, they don't have chicken nuggets.\"  \nI glance down at the children's menu which very clearly shows a picture of a chicken finger with a sign saying \"+99 cents\".  \nAnd with perfect sincerity, not a trace of sarcasm, he delivered this zinger:  \n\"No, they like.. uh, don't serve that here. I can get you a chicken *finger* if you want.\"  \n\nMy jaw dropped a bit. Fucking seriously?  \n\nI mean, yeah I said nugget instead of finger.. but seriously is that not close enough to get you into the mental ballpark where you might make the connection? I mean, \"add chicken something\" is on the menu right there, it's not a crazy modification request.  \nAnd to just shrug it off and wait until the food is already *served* before acknowledging the issue.. just wow.  \n\nAnyway I felt bad for the kid so we didn't stiff him or anything but it just blew my mind. It sucks being the new guy's table.",

To set the scene, it's noon on a Saturday, and I decide to stop by the money center at Big Box Retail to get my rent check made while my husband gets his haircut down the street.\n\nSince they're open 24 hours, I usually like to come do this in the wee hours of the morning to avoid lines, but it's noon on a Saturday, so whatever. There's probably six other people in line, and only one cashier working the desk; she's doing her best and things are moving relatively quickly, but I settle in for a wait. Right in front of me there's a woman with her young son (maybe 2-3 years old) waiting to do a return; every time someone walks by, this adorable little boy asks his mom what the stranger's name is so he can say \"hi.\"\n\nI fiddle with my phone, the line inches forward, and I'm now third in line. Out of nowhere some guy wanders up to the counter with his little daughter sitting on one shoulder. Let's call him Rude Dude.\n\n&gt; RD: Excuse me, I don't want to interrupt, but I need to send some money to my friend in the next town over. Can I do that on the machine over here or do I need to stand in line?\n\nSo far so good, but something about this guy seems a little off; the cashier tells him that he can't do it on the machine so he should fill out his form and get in line. At this point I've been here for about 15 minutes, the mom in front of me is finally at the counter processing her return, and RD is getting kind of antsy. He starts talking to the Older Woman in front of him.\n\n&gt; RD: So how long have you been here?\n\n&gt; OW: Excuse me?\n\n&gt; RD: When did you get here? I just, I think I was here first, I've been waiting here for thirty minutes (yeah okay dude) and I have things to do today.\n\nOlder Woman is giving him a perturbed look, but remains polite.\n\n&gt; OW: I have things to do too, you weren't in line when I got here.\n\n&gt; RD: I just want my spot back! God, what a c---. Why do you have to be such a f---ing b----? Jesus, just f--- off.\n\nI didn't see this coming. At this point a second woman in line has audibly gasped, and everyone has turned to stare while this guy throws a tantrum- my jaw is about on the ground. The poor cashier is standing there looking kind of shell shocked.\n\n&gt; OW: Excuse me?\n\n&gt; RD: Yeah, you heard me you b----!\n\nHe huffs and turns to angrily stop away, when Mom, my new hero, speaks up. She's furious. Rude Dude stomps back over.\n\n&gt; Mom: Excuse me, that was uncalled for!\n\n&gt; RD: Did you hear what I said?\n\n&gt; Mom: Yes, and that was completely inappropriate. I have a small child with me- YOU have a small child with you! What makes you think that's an acceptable way to behave?\n\n&gt; RD: Yeah, whatever b----.\n\nRude Dude turns and leaves, his little daughter still perched silently on his shoulder; she wasn't phased at all, and I feel terrible for her. Older Woman thanks Mom for her heroic words as the cashier finishes her return, and as she's leaving her son pipes up.\n\n&gt; Son: Mommy was he a bad guy?\n\n&gt; Mom: Yes, he was a *very* bad guy, let's hope he doesn't come back.",

        "text": "This all occurred at a Jann Taylor Factory store down in the sunshine state, specifically the magic city.\n\nme, my mother, and another customer were standing in line for about 5 minutes waiting for someone to appear at the register since there were no associates in site. Slowly there was a line forming behind us. A manager finally appears and helps the customer ahead of us. The manager finishes the transaction and then helps my mother who is next. Another associate sees that there is a line forming and comes from the back of the store and opens register #2 and then checks me out alongside my mother. My transaction ends rather fast and then I proceed to stand next to my mother who seems to be having an issue with the e-gift card I gave her for Christmas. \n\n\n\nI should add that my mother has never shopped at Jann Taylor and ever since I gave her an outfit from Jann Taylor for her birthday which was July of 2015 all she wants to buy now is clothes from Jann Taylor, Jann Taylor Factory, Floft etc. She tells me that Jann Taylor clothing fits her great and she always had a hard time buying pants from other stores because they never seem to fit her right. unfortunately due to what occurred, me and my mother will unfortunately never ever shop at Jann Taylor ever again. \n\n\n\nSo to continue, the manager immediately without taking even a second look at the e-giftcard starts shaking her head in an exaggerated manner, extends her arm, tells my mother they do not accept this and she doesn't know what this is, tries to give my mother the e-giftcard back to her. My mother standing there still in her work clothes, tired, feet sore, trying to enjoy our little after work shopping trip to take our minds off of work looks confused and extremely disappointed and obviously sad. I am standing next to her, a rush of embarrassment and confusion courses through my body, I calmly tell the manager that the paper is an e-giftcard and should work like a regular gift card. The manager tells me no, they do not accept the e-giftcard, and that it is a fake e-giftcard from a fake website (I am not kidding). I couldn't help but laugh at what This dumbass said because it was just too absurd not to laugh. I then start reading the e-giftcard word for word out loud to her which states the following: \n\nUSING YOUR E-GIFT CARD IS SIMPLE: (Not really) Redeem In-Store 1. Print this page 2. Bring it into any FLOFT, FLOFT Outlet, Flou &amp; Gey, JANN TAYLOR FACTORY STORE in the United States and Puerto Rico and present it at the time of payment. \n\n\nEven though I read what the paper is stating, The manager still said no in her rude manner and still said it was from an invalid website! Basically accusing me of creating a counterfeit gift card! Meanwhile not only am I embarrassed to the core because my mother is extremely extremely stressed at this point and there are customers witnessing this crazy exchange that me and The manager are having. Me just reading off the paper and telling her that I purchased the gift card through the janntaylor.com website, printed it and now im there and her telling me out loud in a nasty manner that it is a fake gift card, from a fake website and that the whole thing is invalid! Now that the whole store assumes I'm a criminal thanks to Ms. Incompetence, i'm standing there quietly in awe of This idiot and her accusations. \n\n\nShe then orders me to call the number on the paper. I am now calling the number on the certificate. I get someone on the phone, she immediately sounds helpful (such a contrast to the idiot) too bad I didn't catch her name due to my state of mind at that point. I tell the lady on the phone that I am at the Jann Taylor Factory Store, the associate who is apparently a manager is absolutely refusing to accept my e-giftcard and I need someone to verify for her that it is in fact a valid certificate! The lady on the phone is immediately confused and starts chuckling in disbelief, she then asks what my name is, and what my email is, I tell her, she finds the e-giftcard immediately she tells me she wants to speak the manager, I pass the phone, she gets on my phone (remember she ordered me to call the number from my phone) tells the lady right away that the certificate is invalid and she has no idea who she is talking to, The idiot manager does not want to talk to the lady helping me over the phone. She tells the lady in an extremely rude manner that she needs her to call her store. The lady on the phone asks The manager what her store number is, she refuses to divulge any information about her store to the lady on the phone! The idiot hangs up on the lady on the phone because she thinks that i'm fabricating some sort of scam or something. She tells me again that it is an invalid certificate and she is not accepting it, period. Meanwhile while this is happening the associate who is in the back of the store folding clothes is laughing at my direction which angered me even more because now I feel like the whole goddamn staff is mocking me and this is all one big fcking joke. I tell The idiot angrily to get someone else here quickly because at that point any patience I had left is completely gone and I'm real close to going apeshit on her. \n\n\n\n\nAnother lady comes out from the back, she seems seasoned, actually looks like a manager in other words COMPETENT, I ask her if she is the manager, she tells me that they are both managers, I explained to her everything that has occurred in the past half hour, she gets the certificate, scans it or enters it manually and it went through. \n\n\n\nDid I mention that the idiot never attempted to enter the certificate manually? Did I mention that The idiot never tried to actually help me? Did I mention that The idiot never apologized to me and my mother after it was proven that the certificate is A. Valid and B. Went through?! After everything my mother and myself were both on the verge of tears, I am not joking. I was at numerous times about to cry because I felt embarrassed at the fact that there I am just trying to do something nice for my mother and it doesn't work out for me. \n\n\n\nTl;dr: \"Manager\" Jann Taylor accused me of trying to pay with a counterfeit gift certificate even though I showed its all completely valid. People are crazy. \n\n",

        "text": "So I went to a rather well known mall with my mother to do some shopping last weekend, and a post I read today reminded me of the most bizarre attempted return I've ever witnessed. \n\n\n\nThis \"return\" was attempted at a small store that hasn't been opened long, and sells lingerie and bras. It was early afternoon so there was only myself, the mother parental unit, two workers of the store, and a woman with three teenage children. Also note one of the the mall security stations is two doors down across from the store. So I was helping my mom decide between two bras when one worker rushes past me and quickly pulls down the shutters to the store, effectively blocking the view from outside. Of course my mom and I go wtf and look to where the registers are, only to see something that honestly burned to look at. The lady who was with her kids *had taken her shirt and skirt off, standing only in her bra and underwear!* I immediately looked away towards the worker who had closed the shutters, who was talking to security through the shutters while her coworker tried to get the woman to put her clothes back on. NL- Naked Lady, C- Cashier\n\nC- Ma'm, please put your clothes back on!\n\nNL- No! I want to return this bra, I have the receipt so you have to give me a refund!\n\nC- I would be willing to ma'm, but please put your clothes back on!\n\nBy this point security had slipped in and the woman argued with them about returning her bra, thankfully putting her skirt back on but kept her shirt undone, *going so far as to trying to take her bra off to return it.* It was by then her kids finally jumped in and convinced her not to, the cashier looking so relieved as a security guard put his jacket over her and they escorted the whole family out. On the bright side my mom got the employee discount on her stuff, and I went a few shops down to buy them coffee, because no one should ever witness something like that.\n\nWhy *on earth* did she think wearing the item she wanted to return and then trying to strip in the store *was a good idea?!*",

(It's kind of our thing.)\n\nMy grandparents had given me $100 before we went shopping and it was burning a hole in my wallet. After spending $50 of it on gifts for my husband, the rest of it was going toward art supplies for myself, so to Big Craft Store I went.\n\nAfter I spent a while picking what I wanted while mum playfully complained that I was taking too long, she went to the car to wait for me while I checked out.\n\nThere was this lovely cashier who began ringing my items up, and as she rang up one item, I realized I would be over and I said, \"Oh, sweetie, please take that off, I won't have enough.\"\n\nShe *apologized* for it being too expensive for me.\n\nI said to her, \"Don't be sorry, you don't set the prices.\" Because seriously, they don't... and *who* in Oblivion yells at a cashier over craft store items?\n\nShe then had a 50% off coupon which she used on my order for me, great! And continued ringing my things through, but everything *still* came up too much and I was about to tell her to take some things off, but then she had a 25% off coupon and used it as well! In which it came to under just five dollars and some change out of my $50.\n\nI was *unbelievably* happy and I really did thank her from the bottom of my heart and wished her the happiest of holidays, because in all honesty, she never had to do that for me and I know that. But now I'm the happiest newbie artist there ever was.",

He said \"I'm trying to think if there's a way I can give you a credit over the phone.\" I then offered to return to the store, since I live fairly close by. He said okay, and gave me the name of an assistant manager who could give me a form to fill out. \n  \nJust then I decided it wasn't worth it. \n\n\"Well, I've had time to save money, so if it's something less than ten bucks, I'm inclined to just let it go and take the charge.\"\n\nHe suddenly recalled how to fix it on the phone and was very polite, calling me sir several times in the ensuing convo. It was taken care of in one minute tops. \n\nI realized he'd tried to sandbag me into going back to the store so he could fob it off to an underling. Sure, managers are busy, so they are trained to delegate lower priority tasks, but an extra minute of his time was nothing.   ",

This may be true to some extent, but nothing prepares you for collective judgement of stupid people. In a spontaneus thirst for outside Adventure (With snow, storm and -4°C, around 24,8° Freedom Temperature Units) I set off with hunger for breakfast in mind and the phone in my hands. As avid Ingress player, any excuse to go outside fits to play the game. \n\n\nAs the journey progressed I thought it would be a fitting idea to shop my stuff at a different store than the usual discounter I get my stuff from. How I could fool myself. How could my mind be tricked to betray the nice people at my regular store (where I completed my shopping trip, so it was not betrayal, but ... well ... lesser betrayal). Because what I survived was a collective judgement of customers and store clerks.\n\n\nI had a bit of crunch time the past days, I'm self-employed (shameless shoutout to my game Sirius Online!) and occasionally do pooptons of overwork to hit certain deadlines. This comes at the cost of my face, in particular too tired to shave at early mornings and evenings, and do my hair. So I've grown a fluff of a beard and got a rather bright hairline. This in your mind, I went and got todays Lunch, Milk, and a specialty: liquid gouda. Stayed a little to browse through the weekly changing offers, a lot of office stuff, but alas, I lined up at the checkout. \n\n\nA nice older man (OM) in front of me, a huff lady (HL) behind me. Two checkouts open, I got the Sweet Cashier Lady (SC), other one is a former classmate (FC). FC looks at OM and gives SC an annoyed look. Sure the Old Gentleman is taking his time unloading his cart, but we'll all get old one day, and some patience does not kill anyone, right. And I wasn't in a hurry at all, so, go on Sir, take your time! The OM finishes his unloading, and actually is pretty well in packing his stuff rather fast. And then...\n\n&gt; OM: Oh my, I seem to have lost my wallet.\n\nWhich promply causes FC to proclaim \"It has rather been stolen!\" shooting a piercing look at me. HL loses her temper and throws a minor tantrum:\n\n&gt; HL: I knew it. I knew this guy is a thief. Look at his beard. *points at me* He can't be anything else than a thief!\n\n\n&gt; Me (calm): Excuse me, miss...\n\n\n&gt; HL: Don't you dare talk to me. You have that mans wallet in your hand!\n\nI look at my own wallet, made out of onion leather. Every time I look at it, tears are shimmering in my eyes. \n\n&gt; OM: That looks nothing like my wallet. *continues to look through his pockets*\n\n\n&gt; HL: Are you sure? You're old, you must have alzheimers. This is yours. *tries to rip my wallet out of my hand*\n\nSC seems to shrink in size. She clearly does not want to be part of this. My body type clearly says \"Hard to abduct, will bounce back if shot at\" (tackling that currently, being overweight is not cool, and causes health issues!), and my brain automatically mistakes *running* with *attempting muscle suicide*\n\nThe entire Store is now watching me holding my wallet, ready to pay for my stuff, and that Lady, gesturing like a wild yeti at me. I hate situations like these, where everyone is glaring at you and hating you for something you didn't do, and I feel warmth creeping up into my face. What now? Give in, let the lady take my wallet? I'm stumped. Why Brain, why can't you handle this like others can?\n\nBut then, relief. OM has finally found his wallet, in his inner pocket. \n\n&gt; OM: I'm sorry about that. This lady must be very embarrassing to you. \n\nSC is smaller that the chair now while FC is a bit pissed off that she can't frame me for something (never got along in school). I tell the old gentleman that its okay, it wasn't that big of an issue (it was for me, but, man, I really HATE these situations!), and pay my stuff. I want to get out of here. SC and OM apologize again, and as I leave the store I hear FC say \n\n&gt; \"Don't be sorry, people with beards always are suspicious.\"\n\nWith the Lady agreeing loudly. \n\nHumans. \n\n\n_______________________________\n\n\n(Please excuse Typos, Formatting (Still not getting the hand of it apparently) and wrong translations, english is not my mother tongue)",

So my plan of action on entering was to make a beeline right to the men's room to do my business before I actually did my shopping proper.\n\nBy coincidence, I happened to walk through the entrance directly behind another customer (female), who was apparently interested in browsing through the children's book section.  That section incidentally happened to reside right next to the first-floor restrooms where I myself was headed.\n\nSo picture the situation:  customer #1 (the woman) walking directly to the kids' area, followed very closely by me, aiming myself to the same vicinity -- she got the impression that I was following *her* personally, for nefarious purposes unknown.\n\nShe got creeped out enough that she decided to protect herself by walking into the women's restroom, where I of course would not be able to follow without breaking a law or two.  Problem being, she was so distracted by stranger-me walking so closely behind her that she neglected to read the sign on the restroom door -- and she herself walked right into the men's room.\n\nWhen I followed right behind her, suddenly with a confused expression on my face, she wheeled around and was obviously gearing up for a world-class scream-and-slap... until she noticed the two men standing at the urinals across the room, doing their own business.\n\nShe blushed, hightailed it right out of the room -- and when I was finally done with my own business (sharing a chuckle with the other occupants of the room in the meantime), I don't recall seeing her in the store after I started shopping on my own.\n",

        "text": "I went to a popular burger fast food place last night. I ordered a chicken sandwich (the sandwich can either be a burger or chicken), medium meal with a large sweet tea. I glance at the screen - correct sandwich, no tomatoes, no onions, and see a .20 drink upcharge. Looks good. Pay, go to the next window, girl has this sour look on her face and hands me a medium sweet tea. I let her know I had ordered a large, no you ordered a medium. Oh, well I had asked for a large, there's even a drink upcharge on my receipt (I'm fumbling in my purse looking for it) and she tells me no, that's the tax. Extremely rude the whole time. I find me receipt and it does in fact say M sweet tea, but has the .20 drink upcharge. That makes no sense since I ordered a medium meal. I'm trying to show her and explain this to her since maybe there is a glitch in her system and she is straight up ignoring me. I said MA'AM? She then tells me you're getting a large sweet tea for free, so I don't know what you want. No, I'm not getting a large sweet tea for free, I paid a .20 upcharge. I tell her she didn't need to be rude and asked where her manager was. She rudely tells me RIGHT THERE. The manager comes up and I explain what was going on and she was just as confused as I was why it rang up a M sweet tea with a .20 upcharge. I let her know I was just trying to tell the other girl that maybe there was a glitch and she was being rude for no reason and ignoring me. The manager never said sorry, nothing. If you hate where you work so much that you're going to ignore customers, not smile, act like you hate the world, then please just find another job. \n\nThe kicker, when I got home and opened up my sandwich box, it was the burger instead of chicken. The receipt on the box even said CRISPY CHICKEN. -__-",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/3zn5s2/i_hate_buying_cds_on_release_day_now/",
        "text": "I've been buying most of my new CDs on release day (or at least release week) for the past 7 years or so and it's become a big pain in the butt in just the past few months.  (Starting in August) At least 5 of the last 6 CDs I bought on release day/week I've had to ask a sales clerk for it because it wasn't stocked on the shelf at all (some didn’t even a spot for it on the shelf).  (assumingly) The stock/inventory people aren't doing their job by putting new releases out when they're supposed to (or not re-stocking the shelf when the shelf clears out, or the individual chain store is not ordering enough) and I'm then forced to ask someone to check on them (which I hate doing).  What should take 15 minutes to do (a quick in and out if the registers aren't packed) takes like 30+ minutes to do now, including waiting a whole other day to go to another store.\n\nRetail chain store 'T' is one I've had the most trouble with.  3 of the last 6 new CDs I bought (one was as recent as this past Friday) I've had trouble with.  I go to the 'T' nearest where I live and they tell me to go to the other 'T' in the city (which I also hate doing because I hate driving on the street where it's located).  2 of the 3 that I just mentioned the other 'T' store had on the self.  The one I bought this past Friday, the other 'T' had behind the counter and the guy actually admitted to me that they were behind that day due to it being New Year's).\n\nI think allot of this started when the US adapted to 'new music Friday' sometime last year.  I don't remember having problems like this when new CDs came out on a Tuesday.  I'm now limited on buying the CD either that Friday or Saturday b/c that's how long the sale price is good for.  \n\n(Specific story at 'T'): January 30, 2015: I go to the local 'T' to buy the deluxe version of a CD that was released that day.  They only have the standard one on the shelf.  After wasting about 10 minutes with someone from the electronics department, they send me to customer service.  I spent maybe 15+ minutes there just to have the person tell me that the deluxe version is only available online, which turned out to be complete BS because I had someone else buy the same exact one from another 'T' in another city the next day.  I'd rather them tell me they didn't know what the hell they were doing then have them work on how well they could BS to my face.\n\nI do eventually get the CD I want every time, but it's such a big unnecessary rigmarole to get it.\n\n(Please don't diss on me because I still buy physical music instead of downloading.)\n",

The old manager was notorious for not answering the phone, so I wasn't expecting to get there right away, even though there's apparently a new one.\n\nAnyway, I get transferred twice more, before T picks up the phone.\n\nHer: Hello\n\nMe: Oh, I haven't gotten an answer yet, may I be transferred just once more please?\n\nHer: a manager isn't available to talk to you. I transferred you three times already.\n\nMe: I understand. I'll just call back. Is there a good time to call then?\n\nHer: No. /hangs up\n\nI understand transferring is annoying, but 2pm generally isn't that busy at the location, and I was very polite the entire time.\n\nWhat if I had been a customer instead of a former employee trying to update?",

        "text": "So this happened maybe 3 months ago. \nA fairly popular sandwich shop had just opened up in my town and I went down there with my friend.\n Now we decided we wanted to walk. But since it was really hot out we decided I would call my other friend and he would drive us down their and we would walk back.\n So I called him up and he drove us down their. After we got out he asked us \"do you need anything\" we told him we were fine and we went inside. \n\nAfter we ordered the cashier told us our total. $10.50. I reached in my pocket to pay when I realized. \nI had forgotten my wallet at home. I was mortified. \nI then decided I was going to call my friend and ask him to pick up my wallet and drive down there. I then remembered something horrible. \n\nI had forgotten my phone as well. I was then really scared as they had already started making our food. I didn't know what I was going to do. I asked the cashier if I could use her phone (of course I was embarrassed to ask) she then said that she didn't have her phone as they weren't aloud to use it during work hours. \nThe manager then walked up and offered me his phone. I gave him a million thanks and called my friend. I asked him to pick up my wallet and drive over here, he obliged and he was there in a few minutes. I was really happy. Then it happened.\nThere was no money in my wallet. I was about to burst out in tears when the manager said \"don't sweat it, this one is on the house\" I looked up at him \"really?\" \n\n\"yeah it's fine\"\nhe also gave us a 2 free bags of chips and 2 free drinks.\nEvery time after that when I go there I always give a huge tip\n\nTL;DR manager lets us use his phone and then gives us a free meal ",
