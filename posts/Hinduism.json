This is called 'Cosmic Inflation'.\n\n Think of a balloon that expands when air is pushed inside. Whatever exists on the surface of balloon uniformly expands along with surface of the balloon.  So if energy\/matter that was constrained and then expanded, then matter should be seen uniformly spread across the spacetime.\n\nBut what we see in Universe today is different. There is a huge AkAsa, empty space of vacuum, everywhere. Then there are clusters of galaxies and matter sprinkled non-uniformly or non-homogenously  in this AkAsa. \n\n How did this variation come about..? Can just bending of spacetime (gravitation) and the fusion reactions triggered by gravitation alone explain this non-uniform distribution of matter with huge empty spaces in-between..?\n\nBaryonic Acounstic Oscillations - praNAva - OmkAra\n\nScience says the current structure of Universe is explained by Baryonic Acoustic oscillations or Cosmic sound. Vedas and Upanishads say it is caused by OmkAra or praNava.\n\n The early Universe, was an Universe of hot, dense, plasma of dark matter, baryons, electrons and photons. This hot, dense plasma with dark matter bends the spacetime it occupies and produces gravitational warping that compresses matter. But the baryons and electrons are charged and the electromagnetic forces repel. Hence they push back the matter.\n\nThis is like pebble dropping in a pond. An oscillating wave of photons pushes the baryonic matter to the edges. Actually it is like multiple pebbles dropping in a pond. Multiple oscillations carried by photons push the matter differently in different directions.\n\nThese oscillations are mechanical, acoustic waves or sound waves. These sound waves of photons travelling in multiple directions (as in multiple pebbles being dropped in a pond) aggregate matter differently and create 'anisotropies'. Basically they have aggregate differently in different directions.\n\nThese oscillations are called the Baryon acoustic oscillations. They are the praNava. pra means first. Na is 'sound'. PraNava is the first sound produced in the Universe. It is the baryonic acoustic oscillation.\n\nWhen Universe's spacetime expands due to dark energy, these anisotropies also get inflated along with it. The spaces between the aggregated matter which were smaller in the early Universe, became huge when spacetime expanded hugely. Universe spacetime gets filled with aggregated matter with huge AkAsa or empty space between them.\n\nAgain think of a ballon which originally had some ice-cream drops aggregated on it. When this balloon expands, the drops become much far apart.\n\nBut the initial anisotropy was created by praNava, the baryonic acoustic oscillations.\n\nPraNava - The basis of matter and beings\n\nThe Baryonic Acoustic oscillations or praNAva, creates the accumulated matter, thereby creating the 'gravitational seeds' of galaxies and stars. The molecular clouds that were aggregated became galaxies, spawning several stars. These stars, by different types of stellar nucleo-synthesis created different types of elements and compounds. These also created the planetary systems.\n\nThose compounds with carbon then became of basis of long chain molecules, organic seeds of life and living beings.\n\n Thus the praNava, the cosmic sound at the origin is the one responsible for the evolution of matter forms and life.  This means no new elements, compounds and life could have formed without this pranAva or OmkAra.\n\npra means first. Na is 'sound'. PraNava is the first sound produced in the Universe. It is the baryonic acoustic oscillation.\n\nPraNava - The OmkAra- The cosmic sound\n\nThe Cosmic sound or baryon acoustic oscillations are produced by photons travelling in different directions and aggregating the baryons and electrons, creating anisotropies.\n\nWhen pebbles drop in a pond, it produces 'harmonic' waves. Harmonic waves are waves with a frequency and its positive integer multiples. In this case, matter is pushed towards the edges at a specific rate or the multiple of it.\n\n A simple harmonic wave, to the human ear appears as 'rigkhA' which means motion of a pendulum (which indeed is close to simple harmonic motion). It produces a 'mmmmm..' sound.\n\nThe early Universe situation was that photons were pushing the dense baryonic matter in all directions, creating these harmonic motions. At the same time gravitational force (spacetime warping) also acts on the matter and tries to pull them inside.  This would have lead to occasional flare-up of matter being pushed back and forth. This is more than harmonics. This is the sound of 'Om' where occasional flare-up sounds are followed by harmonics.\n\nOm-kAra means that which is created by Om. The Universe is indeed Om-kAra, created by OM, or baryonic acoustic oscillations or praNava, the first sound.\n\nShiva is called Rudra. Rudra means howler the one who makes that sound. Rudra means Om-kAra, the OM who creates. In tamil Shiva is called 'Ongaaran'. This song captures that essence of Shiva being OmkAra and by invoking that OmKara, the shiva in us being brought out.\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/peMAUjH\\_ryA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/peMAUjH_ryA)","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678599579.0},{"title":"Aesthetic Shree Krishna Artwork","author":"Snotohp","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/4j7cwxrjr5na1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678543481.0},{"title":"Unveiling the 16 greatest Qualities of Rama - *5 Minute Gyan*","author":"Srirekhapr","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/lkHh6k2jEzQ","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678591673.0},{"title":"Shiva, Parvati, Ganesha and Skanda travelling with their vahanas and an attendant.

I tried it for a couple of days and I legitimately found myself waking up in the morning and going like \u201c yo, thanks man \u201c (I can\u2019t seem to find a way to explain it, but I hope you know what I mean) \n\n\n\nI hope you understand where I\u2019m at.

Most of the time when the word Dharma is being used, it refers to the Dharma you must uphold as a human. Here, rising above our animal nature and acting not out of compulsion but out of conscious intent is defined as \"Dharma\". It is basically the movement from Matasya Nyaya to a civilised society where people share everything. Matasya means fish. Matasya Nyaya is the law of the fish i.e., big fish eats small fish. Matasya Nyaya is what westerners would call the \"law of the jungle\", or \"might is right\". In Hindu scriptures, it is called Matasya Nyaya.\n\nTo elaborate, the Gods and Goddesses have given human beings the gift of thought, the capability to think beyond our basic needs and then act on these thoughts. Our thoughts and actions should be used to better the world. That is the path of Dharma. So, the most basic Dharma is sharing what we have. In the uncivilised environment, everybody, take animals for example is territorial. Nobody shares anything. Not their land, their dwelling, or their food. Sharing water, food, dwelling etc. is hence the most basic Dharma. It is the reason why, in Indian houses, especially traditional houses, anyone who comes, is offered water without them even asking. You offer people food. You never deny food to anyone who asks for it. Atithi Devo Bhavah, guest is akin to god. If you fail to follow this basic thing of sharing the most essential things, you are an Adharmi, no matter how educated or civilised you are. Sharing is what proves that you don't live by the Matasya Nyaya anymore. That you follow the basic Dharma.\n\nThe above is by the way, the main reason that the Kauravas are Adharmi in the Mahabharata. They have an empire, but they are unwilling to share even just 5 villages with the Pandava cousins. If they can not share with their own family, how will they share with the common people. What kind of rulers will they be. Hence, Krishna as the God Vishnu on earth destroys them.\n\nSecondly, there is the Dharma of your relationship. In this case, it is the duty you have to those you call your own, your family. Your duty as father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, husband, wife etc. This is where for example the Pandavas fail Dharma. They bet their wife and don't protect her. So Krishna has to protect her instead.\n\nThirdly, there is the Dharma of your profession, your ashram and what you do. If you are a warrior, your Dharma is to protect the weak from the strong, to protect good from evil. By violence, if necessary. If you are a Brahmin, your Dharma is to impart knowledge and wisdom to society after having learned it, to be the light of knowledge, in the darkness of chaos. To carry the cultural burden of society. So on for every profession. The Dharma of a student is to learn.\n\nFourthly, the Dharma you carry out as a member of society. You stand with the good and oppose the bad. You stand with the victim against the bully. You speak the truth. You stay humble and treat others with respect. You don't commit violence unless absolutely necessary. You cause as little damage to nature as possible. You repay your debts and remember the kindness bestowed on you. For example, you do not kill a cow. You drank her milk to survive. She made your body and her milk is your flesh and blood. She fed you her milk, hence she is akin to your mother. Killing her or contributing to her death in any way is as big an adharma as killing your own birth mother.\n\nFifth, the most difficult Dharma, the Dharma of a ruler. Of a King. For a king, all other Dharma comes later, the Dharma to his people and his kingdom comes first. Only exceptional people are able to follow this Dharma. Vishnu comes to earth as Ram to carry out this Dharma and to set an example of how it is done.\n\nHe leaves for the forest for 14 years, so that people may understand that the word of an Ayodhyan King can always be trusted. He chooses to suffer for that. The people do not follow their Dharma, they mistrust their innocent queen Sita without evidence. Ram knows Sita is innocent. It breaks his heart, but he exiles Sita, because people should not be ruled by a queen they do not trust. The Dharma of a King has to supersede the Dharma of a husband, a son, or a father. Sita knows why Ram has to exile her. She is the only one who understands. So, she never hates him. Ram lives a tormented life. As soon as his sons are well equipped to rule, he sheds all his kingly robes, walks to the Sarayu river, chanting the name of Sita, and drowns himself so he may meet her again in Vaikuntha. The Ideal King.\n\nThe Ideal ruler or king must always choose his Raj Dharma, his Dharma as a king, above any other Dharma he must carry out. Ram is the Ideal King, the epitome of Raj Dharma. He is worshipped. Bhishma on the other hand, chooses his personal Dharma, his Svadharma, his Dharma as a son to his father, above Raj Dharma, when he vows Brahmcharya and vows not to rule. He does not know if the unborn son of Satyavati will be a good king or not but he has already given up the throne to him. This is adharma. A King\/ruler can not choose anyone over his people. An ideal king sacrifices everything for his people. He must sacrifice his own soul, his own ideals if need be, for the welfare of his people. Like Ram.\n\nAt last, the highest Dharma, the Dharma of a devotee, a bhakt, to surrender everything, his desires, his pride, his ego and become one with the Divine.\n\nThen there is an additional Dharma, the Dharma that society must never forget, the Dharma of protecting Dharma itself, by any means necessary. \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u094b \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u093f \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u0903\n\nI hope you get some idea now.

I\u2019m not at the end of the spiritual path for sure but for once in this journey I do feel that I understand what the ultimate thing is. \n\nI do love the practice and know the highest happiness is from that place within. For most of my day to day life i try to have a sattvic point of view from the things I do. Try to see the highest perspective when interacting with people and what I do. Howvever my actions and surrounding seem so contradictory to this inner truth. \n\nMy life I partake in porn, inactivity, desires for success, depression and senseless social media. Stuff that is tamasic and rajas. I have tried to just \u201clet it be\u201d and i wouls be happy but these negative karmic occurrences would just be kind of a night mare situation. Where I feel as though I\u2019m sitting-on god\u2019s lap and the devil is just spreading it\u2019s ass on my face. This paradox is sometimes jus too much for me. \n\nI personally feel like i touched on the higher teachings too soon and did not do enough preperstion with basic purification. Heck I sometimes i feel I should\u2019ve skipped the whole spiritual trip all together and transformed myself from a lazy loser to a wallstreet andrew tate like dick head before partaking in the truth. I just feel like such a spiritual phony, aspiring for the ultimate while partaking in the profane.\n\nYeah, sometimes I think I just need to humble myself and work on the basic purification stuff too while doing the inner practice. Trying to move from tamas to rajas while loving sattvic is like having to fly from hell 1 to hell 2. How can i even be motivated to do that trip?

This isn't the view supported by scripture or tradition.\n\n> MS 12.95: **Those \u2018revealed texts\u2019 that are outside the Veda(i.e contrary to the Veda), as also all the false theories, are useless**, even when carried to perfection; as they have been declared to be founded on \u2018darkness.\u2019\n\n> \u015arimad Bhagwatam 6.1.40: The Yamad\u016btas replied: **That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion.** The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamar\u0101ja.\n\nIn the Gita, Lord Krishna himself says the same thing.\n\n> Gita 4.39: The man with \u015braddh\u0101, devoted to it (Knowledge)  and master of his senses, attains (this) Knowledge. Having attained Knowledge, he goes without delay to the Supreme Peace.\n\nIn line with the scriptures, Bhagvatpada **Adi Shankaracharya defines \u015braddh\u0101 as \"devotion in the words of the Guru & \u015a\u0101str\u0101s(Hindu Scriptures) \" - (Vivekacudamani 26) there is no liberation without \u015braddh\u0101.**\n\n> Gita 4.40: The ignorant, **the man without faith(\u015braddh\u0101)**, the excessively skeptical man, (everyone of these) **goes to destruction(does not attain liberation)**;(and) for the excessively skeptical person, there is neither this world, nor the next, nor happiness(for he remains ever doubtful of everything).\n\n(Before hitting me with Gita 9.23 etc. they specifically talk only of **Devatas** not non-hindu gods, kindly don't  distort Shri Krishna when everything taken contextually points to the non-acceptance of Non-Hindu philosophies as truth)\n\nThroughout history all Acharyas have followed the same no-compromise stance with respect to other religions, that they're incorrect. Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya etc criticised (& even mocked) multiple non-Hindu philosophies, **Madhusudan Saraswati said that no other religion is even worthy of consideration.** I have more quotations from the Srimad Bhagwatam, Skanda Purana & the Mahabharata but I wish to keep the post relatively short.\n\nRadical Universalism is an idea filled to the core with contradictory notions of ethics, philosophy and even God.

I was going to get married with a girl in the next 1.5 months. Our marriage was arranged and fixed 4 months ago. \n\nIn the first meeting, of course I told her I was never in relationship with anyone and asked her the same and she said no, she was never in relationship with anyone before. After that we were not allowed to meet in person.\n\nSo, we used to talk a lot over phone. I was not ready to meet her in person with no relatives or my family around us. But there was definitely an urge to meet from both of us. But she convinced me somehow to meet. So, we met and l left. Second time, we met and kissed. Third time, I met her in her hostel and we had sex. Then, we met 4 times and we had sex.\n\nFast forward, one day her boyfriend who was still in relationship with her called me and told that they have been in relationship for the last 7 years. He even sent me the screenshots of their chats, call recordings to prove. \n\nThe girl called me so many times and told me that he was very emotional with her and she just didn't want to hurt that person so she had chat with him, calls with him so he didn't take extreme steps.\n\nBut yes, the call recordings, screenshots and everything show that they were both in relationship.\n\nNow, our marriage has been cancelled of course because she was still in relationship with him and never told me about it even after I gave her ample opportunities. \n\nI'm in depression because I'm not going to marry this girl and I also had sex with this girl. I had sex with her because I was so in love with her and knew that we would get married one day. None of our family members know about our sex even after cancelling this marriage. They only know that she was in relationship so it got cancelled.\n\nHave I committed a sin according to Hinduism?

Lord Vishnu.  He spent all his days sleeping in the coils of a large cobra.  The cobra was floating in a giant, and turbulent black sea, which spread from nothingness to nothingness.  Slowly a sound started to be heard.  That sound drove away the nothingness and a Lotus flower began to grow from Lord Vishnu\u2019s belly button.  The lotus grew bigger and bigger until it opened up and revealed Brahma, sitting inside it.  Vishnu instructed Brahma to create a world.\n\n\tBrahma calmed the wind and the water. (I've also read that it was milk??)  He took pedals from the lotus and transformed them into the Heavens, the Earth and the skies.  But the Earth was bare so Brahma created the grass, the flowers and all types of vegetation.  Then he filled the earth with animals and insects, the sky with birds and the waters with fish.  He gave these animals the ability to move, as well as touch, see, hear, smell and taste. Soon the world was full of Brahma's creations.  And when the time comes for God to destroy the world it will be Shiva the Destroyer that does it.\n\nSo we don\u2019t have three, we still have one.  This is called the Trimurti, they are all the same God, but we use different names when he does different things.  Brahma is the Creator, Vishnu is the Preserver and Shiva is the Destroyer.\u201d\n\nAlso, is Manu kind of like Adam and eve.

Or at the very least, a glimpse of what I created  and experienced within my dimension of consciousness.  \n\nIt involves a powerful deity kali. \nNot only through the source of her energy was I able to connect with her.. but physically in human form.\n\nFor a few years I studied Hinduism and meditations.. not so deeply enough to study all stories and teachings. Although at this time in my life I was struggling for a way to find my own truth of existence .. it wasn\u2019t long after worshiping kali and becoming more and more aware and conscious of the power behind her, did I begin to not only see change in my life but I could feel change within myself. Soon everything in my life was so simple, at least the answers to my questions were ..  i felt this powerful connection to kali ma.. I found every single thing living on this earth to hold so much significance to me and to this universe .. for 2 weeks at least I was in this state of purity. I would worship to kali and pray to her\u2026 she was driving me and showing me ways to control my energies and emotions like she gave me the keys to the kingdom and let me walk free ..I felt unstoppable.. \n\nthere came a time shortly after when I was admitted to a psychiatric clinic  for there I was isolated from the outside world. for a moment I could breathe and feel the space between myself and this physiological world grow bigger.. \n\nSoon enough after a week or so I was able to go outside on the grounds to get fresh air.. to me this was wonderful. I had been submitted to be inside that building all hours of the day so to see sun was a gift on its own.. and to breathe the air, yes. \n\nIt was in this moment when I went outside and sat on a bench on the southeast corner of the compound to hear the city moving all around me.. people doing people things .. society making its mark with the sound of new construction and traffic. Through the sound of the world around me I felt at peace , despite the noise in the streets I felt the wind across my face biting me with its pinching cold teeth, the sun beating down on me pulverizing my skin into a warm ecstasy of feeling. The feeling of being alive in this vessel I\u2019ve been driving was at a peak. \n\nWithin these moments of time.. there was a woman who looked as if she could be homeless. Careless\/ carefree and ragged (but in the most beautiful way) yet she held something in her that illuminated everything around her..  this woman sat beside me as if she had known me as long as I\u2019d been breathing. Her eyes pierced  into mine like a laser beam.. those eyes held so much knowledge in them \u2026 the way she looked at me was as if she and I had shared something in common. As if this moment was happening and we both knew it. I had an apple I was eating.. she said \u201ccould I have that apple \u201c and I said yea.. she eats the apple carelessly. During this whole scenario she is acting as if there is not a worry in the world..  She looked at me and spoke words.. for a minute or to after she began to tell me things.. she told me she was my mother \u2026. She said You are my son, your eyes are filled with love.

I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening and I don\u2019t think I fully understood it at the time) regardless it was a powerful moment I will never forget . \n\nThe fact that she told me she was my mother. The fact that she confided in me that she was not only my mother but thee mother.. the mother of creation and destruction.. it had me so amazed as troubled all at the same time..like a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nShe asked me to go to the river with her which was 10-12 blocks away from the hospital residents .. and myself as a admired resident I wasn\u2019t able to leave the ground so I Refused the offer..\n\nLooking back now I feel like I had missed an opportunity or I had failed a test and proved I was not ready for whatever it was the she wanted to tell me or show me. Or maybe that\u2019s what was supposed to happen..\n\nA few minutes later in shock and disbelief I started walking back to the door of the building. As I grew closer to the entrance I look back behind me and there she is about 20 feet behind myself following me.\n \nI go inside and walk down the long hallway to the door of the area I was living in and I look behind me once more .. there she is \n\n\nShe looked at me.. through the glass of the door. \n\nThis is my story and my experience with the great mother.

But it's something that weighs on my heart from time to time.\n\nI'm a Hindu who comes from what I can only describe as a non-traditional background. I'm not Indian, was raised in the West, and under a different religion at that.\n\nAs an adult, I discovered Sanatana Dharma during some of the lowest points of my life and it has been nothing short of life changing.\n\nIt's like these truths were always inside me, just waiting to be ushered forth to the surface and remembered.\n\nI devote every day and all of my actions to God. I have a close relationship with Bhagavan. I do puja daily, read my Gita, read other texts to broaden my knowledge and keep this path. I even started learning Hindi so I could read some books that don't have English translations.\n\nMy identity as a Hindu is important to me. That's not to say I identify with the self or \"religion\" in a bad way, as some would warn against. It's just that I don't ever want to consider myself a \"half-hearted\" Hindu, or someone who borrows some ideas but never sticks with it. A lot of people do that in the US, and while you could make arguments for or against this, it's just my personal choice that I would not be afraid to call myself a Hindu and carry on Vedic tradition.\n\nBut so many things are new to me. I know when it comes down to it, God is understanding, ie Krishna will accept a flower with love. But I still feel a pang that some things don't come natural to me, that I didn't grow up with them. What things to use for puja, which mantras to recite, etc.\n\nI believe the quest for knowledge is important and every day, I try to learn more and devote this learning to God. That the effort would be enough.\n\nAnd inside, I do feel that sincerity of heart is most important, that these rituals are of man and that dharma takes precedence, not worldy rituals and ways of life.\n\nBut there is the confliction I still face, perhaps it is passion obscuring my true vision of what is good.\n\nI often ask myself, am I good enough? \n\n(I won't go into detail here, but I've posted before that a few months ago, I was in a severe car accident. I survived quite fortunately, totally unharmed. In that moment, I felt Krishna's love ingrained in my soul. The soul does not forget its connection to God, it is pure and cannot be destroyed. And I didn't feel that I wasn't enough, or that there was any measure of enough or too much. Just love, uninterrupted.)\n\n\nEven so, this thought plagues me from time to time. I try to push it away, but still... \n\nWould love to hear other's opinions on this, or if you ever felt it as well. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd49\n\nEdit: Wow, just logged on after making this post sometime last night before I went to bed.

But who is God? Where is God? What is God? Most of us have our personal Gods. It maybe Shiva or Ganesha, Krishna or Jesus. But are all these Gods really God?\n\nWe go to a temple or a church and we pray. We search for our God without realizing that God lives in the temple of our heart. Some of us even believe in many Gods without realizing that God is one. God is SIP, the Supreme Immortal Power. God has no name or form. God has no birthday. The Supreme Power is immortal. SIP is birthless and deathless, beginningless and endless. But because we do not go on a quest for God, we do not realize that God is SIP, the Supreme Immortal Power everywhere, in everything.\n\nShivoham literally means Shiv Aham, I am Shiva, I am God. How can I be Shiva? The name Shiva here does not personify only Lord Shiva, but any God whom we pray to. When we yearn for God so much and when our yearning takes us on a Divine quest, then we realize \u2013 Who am I? Am I this body? No, one day, the body will die. Am I the mind? No, where it is, I cannot find. If I am not the body and mind, how can I be the ego? When we realize that the true self is not the body, mind and ego, but rather that Spark Of Unique Life \u2013 the SOUL that gives us life 9 months before our so-called birthday, this Self-Realization makes us realize that I am not 'I'. I am the Soul. The Soul is none other than SIP. Therefore, I am SIP. I am Shiva.\n\nShivoham, thus, is not just another Hindu mantra. It is God- Realization. It is the Realization that all the mythological Gods, hundreds, thousands or even lakhs of Gods, are not really 'God'. God is nameless and formless. That God lives in the sky is nothing but a lie! God is the life that throbs within. God is SIP and SIP manifests as the Soul, in you and me, a butterfly, a bee and a tree, even a dog and a frog. Anything alive, anything that has a Soul, has a spark of Divine energy within. This is God. This is Shiva. This is SIP. Shivoham, thus is a mantra or a chant of one who is God-realized. It reveals that one has found Shiva, God or SIP within, in their heart. It not only shows that a person has passed the phase of Self- Realization, realizing that he is the Divine Soul, but has also reached that state of God Realization, realizing God is SIP, the Supreme Immortal Power within.\n\nThousands of years ago, the ancient Hindu faith was known as Sanatana Dharma. It was not a religion. It was Dharma, a way of faith, a philosophy of life. The original Hindu faith was Sanatana, which means the eternal truth, which should be a way of life, a moral duty and an ethical philosophy. Thereafter, Sanatana Dharma got diluted into a mythological religion like any other, with scriptures, rituals and dogmas. In the original teachings of Sanatana Dharma, there was no God with a name and form. But then, how did one pray to God? People started praying to God in the form of nature, as the Sun God, the Wind God and the Rain God, to name a few. Then, these Gods were picturized and people gave these Gods attributes, names and forms and these are the Gods that have evolved into the Gods and Goddesses that we believe in today.\n\nSomewhere in the scriptures and in the Hindu faith, came the word, Shivoham. It is generally attributed to Adi Shankara in the 8th century when he recited the Nirvana Shatakam with the line, Chidananda Rupah Shivoham Shivoham. When young Shankara went in search of a Guru and he was asked, 'Who are you?' and 'Why are you here?' he is said to have recited this answer. The young boy had realized that he was a manifestation of God.\n\nWe may believe in Krishna, Ganesha, Hanuman or any other God. But we think that God is separate from us. Unfortunately, we don't realize that we too are a part of God. We grow up believing in the myth and we live and die with it. We believe that God is somebody who lives in Heaven and one day, we will meet God to settle our Karma. Very few of us, like Shankara, realize that the Power of God is within us. The Vedas and the Upanishads state this truth in the Mahavakyas, the principal statements \u2013 Aham Brahmasmi \u2013 I am the Lord, and Ayam Atma Brahma \u2013 This Soul is a Power and part of the Supreme.\n\nUnfortunately, although this was revealed to us thousands of years ago, we have, over the centuries, diluted the truth and have lost sight of God. God is not far away. God is here. God is now. God is SIP, the Power within. Realize who you truly are, Tat Twam Asi, Thou Art That. Realize the truth of Shivoham.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1677927699.0},{"title":"Concentration","author":"msrinivasan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/hinduism\/comments\/11i9ciz\/concentration\/","text":">Converging the faculties of the mind to one point is concentration.

I am a Hindu. I want to talk about afterlife. You start to discover about it when either you have lost a close loved one or when you yourself are close to death. I have read about Hindu's concept of afterlife, but most concent and answers on the internet are from the Westerners (folks from western Europe and North America) who have experienced near death experience (NDE) and their outlook on life and death. \n\nI personally find Hindu's concept of afterlife harsh. But before that I would like to talk about their concept. It is believed that if you have had good deeds, after leaving your body, you feel immense pleasure and warmth with a glowing white light infront of you. Almost like devine is embracing you himself. You start to see you passed away loved ones moments before you death. Almost everyone have described their NDE like this. It is believed that the ones you love never leave you, they always remain by your side and ultimately they come to take you to heaven with them when you are dying. The pleasure they felt after their death was so immense that they often refuse to return back to life but when they do, their outlook on life completely changes because now they know what's waiting for them on the other side. \n\nI personally don't seek moksha because it's and unknown state and nobody has enough knowledge about it nor do I seek reincarnation.

I know how that sounds when  read as-is. To expound, I've always been a voracious reader. Everything I  can get my hands on, in all subjects you could think of or name - so  I'm always willing to read or hear anything anyone has to say.\n\nSecond,  I have a deep love of all people, and most of my religious studies have  been based around communicating better and accepting other viewpoints,  and learning how I can best serve others.\n\nBut  a specific religious alignment I've never had. My spiritual practices  align most closely with Buddhism, and I'm particularly drawn to the  beliefs and culture of early Buddhism and Hinduism around that period. I  could be totally misguided as every reading, every exposure, every  communication will necessarily be different from person to person.\n\nRecently, I've been inundated with events and circumstances that have steered me toward the specific deity, Saraswati.\n\nI've  done a good bit of searching - googling, YouTube, lessons, etc - and  although I'm very early on in this, I'm trying to hone and focus on  learning about Saraswati.\n\nAre  there any books (available in English, preferably) that would give me  more information in one place, to start on a journey like this? When I  say early on, I mean it's only been a few days, but this has become an  intuitive leap of spirit.\n\nI would  go further into saying that I've sat in Zazen for 20 years now, and over  the past two years things have opened up in a way that I can't properly  explain.\n\nHow does one worship  Saraswati? How do I learn more? How do I know if I'm somehow receiving  communication or that Saraswati is showing up for me? As much as I know I  have to figure these things out for myself, I would like the input of  those more familiar with this deity, and any helpful input would be  appreciated, considered, and focused to the extent I'm capable.\n\nThank you so much, I appreciate your patience with my own clumsy communication style.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677641396.0},{"title":"Bhagvad Gita in one sentence - what I understanding.

What is the\r\ndeity or up&sya devatd in the sandhya worship ?\r\nH. H.: Before we consider that, please tell me\r\nwhat you understand ordinarily by the sandhya\r\nworship ?\r\nE.\\ By sandhya worship we mean the worship of\r\nthe rising Sun, the setting Sun or Sun in the mid\r\nheavens.\r\nH. H.: Quite so. Comprehensively speaking, you\r\nmean worship of the Sun ?\r\nE.: Yes.\r\nH. H.: You tell me that sandhya. is the worship\r\nof the Sun and yet you ask me what is worshipped in\r\nthe sandhya. Don\u2019t you think it is an unnecessary\r\nquestion ?\r\nE.: Put so, it may seem an unnecessary question,\r\nbut my real question is, what is the Sun that is\r\nworshipped ?\r\nH. H.: What do you understand ordinarily by\r\nthe Sun ?\nE \u2018 We mean the bright celestial orb in the sky.\r\nH. H.: Then it is that bright celestial orb that\r\nis worshipped.\r\nE.: But that orb is, according to science, mere\r\ninert matter in a state of high combustion and is\r\ncertainly not worthy of being worshipped by intelli\u00ac\r\ngent beings like ourselves. It can neither hear our\r\nprayers nor respond to them. I cannot believe that our\r\nancestors were so ignorant as to address their prayers\r\nto a mere burning mass of matter.\r\nH. H.: I quite agree with you. They could never\r\nhave been so foolish.\r\nE.: What then did they see in the Sun to justify\r\ntheir prayers being addressed to it ?\r\nH. H.: You said just now that addressing of\r\nprayers to inert matter cannot be justified by reason.\r\nE.: Yes.\r\nH. H.: What then must be the nature of the entity\r\nto which a prayer is addressed ?\r\nE.: The primary condition is that it must not be\r\nmere inert matter, but must be endowed with\r\nintelligence.\r\nH. H.: And the second condition ?\r\nE.: That it must be able to hear our prayers and\r\nbe powerful enough to answer them.\r\nH. H.: Quite so. If our ancients were not fools\r\nand yet addressed their prayers to the Sun, their con\u00ac\r\nception of the Sun must have been quite different fromthat of mere inert matter in a state of high com\u00ac\r\nbustion.\r\nEYes, they must have also postulated of it\r\nintelligence, the capacity to hear us and the ability\r\nto help us.\r\nH. H.: The \u2018us\u2019 including not only all those who\r\nare now living to raise their hands in prayer to the\r\nSun, but also all the generations, past and future, in\u00ac\r\nfinite in number though they may be ?\r\nE.: Of course.\r\nH. H.: The entity that is worshipped as the Sun\r\nis therefore one whose intelligence or ability knows\r\nno limitation of space or time.\r\nE.: It must be so.\r\nH. H.: You have now got your answer to the\r\nquestion as to who is worshipped in the sandhya ? It\r\nis an intelligent Being, omniscient and omnipotent in\r\nthe matter of hearing and responding to its votaries.\r\n2. THE INNER REALITIES\r\nE.: Your Holiness then means that it is a deva\r\nwho has his habitation in the solar orb ?\r\nH. H.: Quite so. He has not only his habitation\r\nthere but the solar orb itself is his physical body.\r\nE.: Your Holiness means that the deva enlivens\r\nthe solar orb, just as we do our physical bodies ?\r\nH. H.: Just so.\n136\r\nDialogues with the Guru\r\nE.: If then he is embodied just like us, how does\r\nhe happen to have such high intelligence or power as\r\nto merit our obeisance ?\r\nH.H.: He attained that status by virtue of the\r\nappropriate karma and updsana done by him in a pre\u00ac\r\nvious life.\r\nE.: Does Your Holiness mean that he was at one\r\ntime just like ourselves and that he attained that\r\nstatus by his endeavour ?\r\nH. H.: Yes.\r\nE.: Then he is no more than a Jlva, which I also\r\nam. Why should a Jiva, make prostration before\r\nanother Jlva, howsoever superior ?\r\nH. H.: Why should your son or pupil respect you\r\nand why should you show respect to your superior\r\nofficers ? Are not both of you Jivas ?\r\nE.: No doubt we are. But we respect our\r\nsuperiors as it is in their power to help us or injure\r\nus, if they so desire.\r\nH. H.: That is a very low kind of respect. Any\u00ac\r\nhow, taking even that kind of respect, we must res\u00ac\r\npect Surya devata if it is in his power to help us or\r\ninjure us, if he so desires.\r\nE.: Of course.\r\nH. H.: Being a Jlva as much as your superior\r\nofficers, he will help you if you appeal to him for\r\nhelp or injure you if you ignore or despise him. In\r\nyour own interest then, you are bound to worship\r\nhim and secure his good will.\nE.: But I need not court the favour nor fear the\r\ndispleasure of my superior officer, if I carry out the\r\nduties of my office faithfully.\r\nH. Hr. Quite so.\r\nE.: If I preserve that attitude, there is no reason\r\nwhy I should propitiate my superior officer.\r\nH. H.: Certainly not.\r\nE.: Similarly, if I carry out strictly the duties\r\nenjoined on me by the Sastras, I need not propitiate\r\nany other Jlva, be he the highest deva.\r\nH. H.: Quite so.\r\nE.: Then, should I not give up the worship of\r\nSurya devata ?\r\nH. Ii.: Certainly you may, unless of course such\r\na worship is part of the duties enjoined on you by\r\nthe Sastras.\r\nE.\\ How can that be ?\r\nH.H.: It is true that an honest and strict officer\r\nin performing the duties of his office need not mind\r\nthe pleasure or the displeasure of his immediate\r\nsuperior. But the mere fact that he thinks it necessary\r\nor obligatory to perform those duties properly, shows\r\nthat he has as the ultimate end the pleasure, or avoid\u00ac\r\nance of the displeasure of a still higher officer who is\r\nsuperior to him as well as to his immediate superior.\r\nEven if he has no personal acquaintance with that\r\nhigher officer, he always has in the background of his\r\nmind, an undefined power, call it the King or the Government, when he performs the duties of his office.\r\nAnd that power has the ability to benefit him by a re\u00ac\r\ncognition of his services or to punish him. by taking\r\nnote of his delinquencies. Further, that power rules\r\nboth him and his immediate superior officer. If there\u00ac\r\nfore that power requires him to behave in a particular\r\nmanner towards his superior officer, he cannot afford\r\nto disobey that injunction, for if he disobeys no| only\r\ndoes he incur the displeasure of that officer but also\r\nof the higher power.\r\nE.: That is so.\r\nH. H.: Similarly if a power which rules both\r\nyou as well as Surya devata requires you to conduct\r\nyourself in a particular manner towards that deva, you\r\ncannot afford to neglect that injunction, but must con\u00ac\r\nform to it or take the risk of incurring the displeasure\r\nof that deva as also of the higher power.\r\nE. It is no doubt so. But in that case in prostrat\u00ac\r\ning myself before Surya devata, I shall be really\r\nworshipping the higher power even when my worship\r\nmay seem addressed to the Surya.\r\nH. H.: What of that ?\r\nE.: If I am able to conceive of such a higher\r\npower who rules even the Surya, that power is really\r\nthe worshipped entity although to all appearances the\r\nworship is addressed to the Surya only.\r\nH. H.: Quite so.\r\nE.: But Your Holiness said that it was Surya\r\ndevata. who was worshipped ?\nH. H.: Yes. It is correct so far as persons who\r\nare not able to conceive of a higher power are con\u00ac\r\ncerned. To those however who can conceive of that\r\npower He is the real upasya. That power is called\r\nHiranyagarbha. He enlivens and ensouls not only the\r\nSurya, but all devas. He enlivens and inhabits not\r\nonly the solar orb but all things. He is the cosmic\r\npersonality who is the soul of all things.\r\nE.: I suppose, just as we have the sense of T\r\nin our physical bodies, so does that cosmic personality\r\nhave the sense of T in the entire cosmos.\r\nH. H,: He has.\r\nE.: If so, the difference between Him and me\r\nlies not in the presence or the absence of the sense of\r\nT but only in the degree, the range or the magnitude\r\nof that sense. Mine is restricted ; His is extended.\r\nH. H.: It is so.\r\nE.: If it is the sense of \u2018I\u2019 that is responsible for\r\nthe concept of a Jiva, he must be as much a Jiva as\r\nmyself.\r\nH. H.: Quite so. In fact He is called the First\r\nBorn.\r\nE.: Then, even if this higher power happens to\r\nbelong to the category of Jivas just like myself, the\r\nsame objection which I mentioned against the worship\r\nof Surya devata holds good in his case also.\r\nH. H.: What then would you like to worship ?\r\nE.: A transcendent power which is not a Jiva.\nH. H.: Have it then that it is such a transcen\u00ac\r\ndent power that is worshipped in the sandhya. We\r\ngive Him the name of Isvara, the Lord, or the\r\nantarydmi, the inner ruler.\r\nE.: But I have heard it mentioned that the\r\nterms \u2018Lord* and \u2018Ruler\u2019 are only relative terms which\r\nare used in regard to Him when we want to describe\r\nHim in relation to the universe, which is \u2018lorded over\u2019\r\nor \u2018ruled\u2019 by Him.\r\nH. H.: Yes, it is so.\r\nE.: It cannot be that we can have no conception\r\nof Him apart from his relationship of some sort to the\r\nuniverse. His relationship to the universe can at best\r\nbe only an extraneous circumstance. In His essence,\r\nHe must have an independent existence quite unrelat\u00ac\r\ned to any thing else.\r\nH. H.: You are right. We call that unrelated\r\nessential existence Brahman.\r\nE.: If it is so, that must be the real object of\r\nworship rather than the relative aspect called Isvara.\r\nH. H.: It is even as you say. It is really the\r\nunqualified Brahman that is worshipped in the\r\nSandhya.\r\n3. THE RECONCILIATION\r\nE.: I cannot really understand Your Holiness.\r\nYou first said that it was the solar orb that was the\r\nobject of worship ; but when I pointed out that it\r\nwas only inert matter, you said that it was Surya devata that was the object of worship; when\r\nagain I pointed out that he was only a limited Jiva\r\nlike myself, you said it was Hiranyagarbha, the cos\u00ac\r\nmic soul, that was the object of worship ; when once\r\nagain I pointed out that he was after all a Jiva how\u00ac\r\never cosmic his sense of T may be, you said that\r\nIsvara the Lord and Ruler of the universe was real\u00ac\r\nly the object of worship ; and lastly when I said that\r\neven he is but a relative aspect of Brahman, you said\r\nthat the object of worship was Brahman -itself.\r\nH. H.: I did say so.\r\nE.: But I fail to see how all these statements can\r\nbe reconciled.\r\nH. H.: Where is the difficulty ?\r\nE.: The object in a particular worship can be\r\nonly one. How can it be the solar orb or the deva en\u00ac\r\nlivening it or Hiranyagarbha or Isvara or Brahman\r\nat the same time ?\r\nH. H.: I never said that it was the solar orb or\r\nthe deva and so on.\r\nE.: Does Your Holiness mean to say then that\r\nthe object of worship is the solar orb and the deva\r\nand Hiranyagarbha and Isvara and Brahman all put\r\ntogether ?\r\nH. H.: Nor did I say anything of that sort.\r\nE.: How then am I to understand Your Holiness\u2019\r\nstatements ?\r\nH.H.: When did I tell you that the upasya was\r\nSurya?\n\nE.: When I mentioned that the physical mass of\r\nburning matter cannot be the object of worship.\r\nH. H.: Before you mentioned it, I said that it\r\nwas even that mass that was the upasya.\r\nE.: Yes\r\nH. H.: I never mentioned that it was the solar\r\nbody or the deva as an alternative. To one who cannot\r\nconceive of an enlivening soul, the'upasya is the phy\u00ac\r\nsical mass ; to one, however, who declines to accept\r\ninert matter as an object of worship, I said the upasya\r\nwas Surya devatd. The upasya is ever one but its\r\nexact nature varies with the competence of the wor\u00ac\r\nshipping aspirant. The upasya gets further refined\r\nwhen even the concept of a deva does not satisfy the\r\nenquiring devotee. We say then that it is Iliranyagarbha. When even such a concept seems meagre or\r\nunsatisfactory, we tell the devotee that he is really\r\nworshipping the Supreme Lord himself. When he\r\nbegins to feel that even the Lord-ness is a limitation of\r\nHis essential nature, we tell him that it is the infinite\r\nBrahman itself that is really worshipped. Where is\r\nthe difficulty ?\r\nE.: Does Your Holiness then mean that it is not\r\npossible to definitely say what the object of worship\r\nin the sandhyd is, except with reference to the mental\r\nequipment or intellectual advancement of the wor\u00ac\r\nshipper ?\r\nH. H.: How can there be an object of worship if\r\nwe ignore the worshipper ? The nature of the wor\u00ac\r\nshipped necessarily depends upon the nature of the\r\nworshipper\nE.: How ?\r\nH. H.: Take me for example. All of you show me\r\nrespect. But the object of respect, though it is,\r\nroughly speaking, myself, does differ with each one of\r\nyou. Ordinary people respect me and like to see me\r\nsurrounded by a glittering paraphernalia ; their atten\u00ac\r\ntion and respect are claimed by those articles rather\r\nthan by my personality. Such people will show the\r\nsame respect to others who have similar para\u00ac\r\nphernalia. Their homage is not therefore really paid\r\nto me but only to the paraphernalia. Some others\r\nrespect me for the position that I hold or for the\r\nAsrama in which I am. Such people will equally res\u00ac\r\npect others who are or may come to be in such a posi\u00ac\r\ntion or in such an Asrama ; their homage is therefore\r\nnot paid to me but to my position or to the Asrama.\r\nAnd some others may not care what position I hold or\r\nin what Asrama I am, but give me homage wher\u00ac\r\never I go and however I may be ; their object of res\u00ac\r\npect is my physical body. A few others will not mind\r\nif my body is dark or ugly or even diseased, but will\r\nnevertheless give me homage if by purity of mind\r\nand character or by the power of my intellect and\r\nlearning or by any spiritual merit that I may possess\r\nI command their respect. Very few indeed will respect\r\nme for the spark of divine intelligence which inheres\r\nin me, as it does in all of you.\r\nE.: Of course it is not possible to say that all the\r\ndevotees that approach Your Holiness are of the same\r\nmental equipment.\r\nH. H.: Quite so. But ordinarily all these peo\u00ac\r\nple, whether they really tender homage to the para-phernalia or to my status and Asrama or to my body\r\nor to my mind or to my intellect or to the divine\r\nspark in me, prostrate before me to show their respect.\r\nCan you tell me, apart from any reference to the\r\nseveral devotees, to whom or to what they prostrate ?\r\nE.: It is no doubt very difficult to answer.\r\nH. H.: Similarly with every kind of worship.\r\nExternally viewed, there will be no appreciable differ\u00ac\r\nence between the one who respects me for the para\r\nphernalia and another who respects me for the divine\r\nspark in me. Externally viewed, there will similarly\r\nbe no appreciable difference between the devotee\r\nwho in his blind faith is content to address his pray\u00ac\r\ners to the luminous Sun and another who turns to it\r\nas a visible symbol of the infinite Brahman. The\r\nquestion as to what is the upasya in the sandhya wor\u00ac\r\nship can therefore be answered only in this way.\r\nE.: I now understand how in the simple worship\r\nof the Sun all possible stages in spiritual perception\r\nhave been provided for.\r\nH. H.: It is not only this, for you will find, if you\r\nconsider the matter still further, that all the three\r\nways known as karma, bhakti and jnana have been\r\ngiven places in the daily worship, but that is a differ\u00ac\r\nent matter. Simple as the sandhya worship seems to\r\nbe, it is sufficient to help us on to the highest stages. It\r\nis as useful to the highest aspirant as it is to the be\u00ac\r\nginner. It is a folly, therefore, to belittle its value or\r\nto neglect it in practice","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677489939.0},{"title":"Need to identify what Mandir this is","author":"gamerslayer1313","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/6p4rb1qsemka1.jpg","text":"This is in my hometown in Pakistan, and is a beautiful focal point in the middle of the old city center.

I am Aiden, I'm from Kolkata. So to give you the context, we need to go back to 2016. My father (34), tells me and my mom about a strange dream that he had encountered. He was an atheist but that dream changed his and our lives forever. He saw Goddess Tara, she commanded him to be worshipped by him and his future generations. Few weeks later, he saw that same Idol of Tara that he encountered. He asked the shopkeeper about it, to which he replied the idol was booked already. But, the moment he was present at the shop, the one guy that ordered that idol called up and cancelled it. My father that day only bought it home. Since\u00a0then, we have recieved many comments about Tara turns home into cremation ground. But, my father didn't listened and used to Puja everyday on his own and during Kaushiki Amavasya and Kali Puja, we used to have a Brahmin come over and do Puja whole night.\u00a0\n\nCut to: 28 August 2020, My father returned from his office and suffered a cardiac arrest. We lost him. My mom was totally depressed and we went to our house in the towns, we returned after a year. Anyways, from last year I'm worshipping her, I'm doing Puja and the other things. But still, there are many people who are commenting on it. Even few people said \"His father is already gone, his turn is next\". Is this Tara testing me? Should I continue the worship? I see her as my mother. Many people have told me to give that idol away to a temple, throw it away in the river. I really can't. It's like a giving a piece of my heart away.

Namaste **\ud83d\ude4f**\n\nI wanted to talk about the reason why I became vegetarian.\n\nMy story of being vegetarian is based on my religion.\n\nI'm Hindu and I believe that ahimsa, the law of noninjury, is the Hindu's first duty in fulfilling religious obligations to God and the world as defined by Vedic scripture.\n\nI believe that eating meat without necessary reason is unethical and a sin. Many Hindus do eat meat, but unless it is necessary for them based on medical, environment based (like it's hard to get vegetarian food in a specific place) or occupation based, I think they shouldn't eat meat Same goes for non Hindus.\n\nI don't judge anyone who eats meat though. I ate meat until last week since I had no choice. (long story) I believe everyone is responsible for their actions and their lifestyle.\n\nMany animals are sentient creatures and we should do our very best to minimise harm to them if possible. They deserve to live happy and free from suffering.\n\nI am SO happy I made this vow finally. I have wanted to be vegetarian since 8 years old, and when I started practicing Hinduism, meditation and yoga, the desire just grew stronger. The desire to eat meat was always weak for me, but now it's just gone.\n\nAre you a vegetarian?

One is that all gods and goddesses are depicted and described as beautiful\/handsome. There are scriptures which go into detail about their beauty. On the other hand all the demons\/asuras and basically bad\/evil creatures are depicted as ugly with details describing their ugliness. For example Alakshmi is the goddess of misfortune, laziness, poverty, jealousy all the negative attributes. While I\u2019ve observed this over and over again, it makes me think that everything positive, pure and good is always associated with good looks. Everything that is essential dark and evil is associated with ugliness. So even when good looks has such value and importance in this ancient religion, of course people will form negative opinions about who they perceive to be ugly. Even the description of Alakshmi is described as \u201cthin as a stick and tall, thick lips, beady eyes, big crooked nose, big face, rough hair). A lot of these are for example description of how I look even, and no matter what I cannot change these certain features. I don\u2019t think I am such a horrible person but I have definitely been treated badly because of the way I look. If humans can bully people for their appearance then obviously good looks do matter and they always will. Good looks aren\u2019t solely important as other good attributes matter as well, but I haven\u2019t heard of a evil goddess described as beautiful looking or a good goddess described as ugly looking. When Alakshmi and Lakshmi emerged from Samudra manthan I find it interesting that Alakshmi is automatically the evil one and banished, she doesn\u2019t even have a husband or anyone who cares about her. She was put into existence automatically as the evil one. Lakshmi Devi on the other hand is the complete opposite.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1677347860.0},{"title":"Is That True...

I've heard already how organic materials like cotton are great for prana to flow, and how colors can have an affect as well and that white clothing is pure and recommended. And that all clothing should be properly prepared and not all in a wrinkled mess. However what about the form of the clothing itself? The typical clothes of a devotee or yogi will he a shawl, kurta, and dhoti. Since the first time wearing these, the loose way which they fit the body felt natural and great. And so knowing that often things that are traditional within our Sanatana Dharma actually hold a scientific reason and benefit, I was wondering if the same goes for clothing. I've heard in general the certain fit and looseness of yogic clothing is beneficial and is connected to prana, but not much else.

I've read a lot of about different philosophical tendencies, mainly advaita Vedanta. I've read a lot about Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Yogananda. I've read a lot *about* different things, but I've only just recently started reading the Gita, and actually looking into the more religious side of this. Before now, it has mainly been a mental\/education\/semi-secular endeavour. \n\nI'm a Christian, raised in the southern US. I've just started reading the Gita, and some of the lines in it are, for want of a better term, scaring me. When Arjuna describes seeing Krishna turn into Vishnu,  he mentions seeing the soldiers chewed in Vishnu's \"awful mouth.\" Krishna says he \"is become death, destroyer of worlds,\" he talks about how Arjuna is his weapon to kill all these people. \n\nI know that a lot of this is metaphor, that kurekshetra was a situation that, ultimately, could not be avoided by this point, and it needed to happen. Even the good people who had aligned themselves with the Kurus had chosen a path against dharma, and that due to the nature of the soul none of them really die, because they are not their bodies. \n\nBut... It scares me. Kali scares me, with the demon heads. Shiva sometimes scares me, too. \n\nI am also aware of how weird that is, considering my own religion frequently talks about eating the flesh and drinking the blood of our human incarnation of God. We often use imagery of Him on a cross, nailed to wood, bleeding and wearing a crown of thorns. I am not, in the slightest, suggesting that Hinduism or Indian culture is scary. Just that... For some reason, these particular things are sticking out and scaring me. \n\nAre there any former or current Christians here who felt similar in their journey?\n\nI've been reading about and learning about philosophical concepts in Hinduism for a long time now, long enough that at this point I definitely consider myself a nondualist, or at least nondual adjacent.

They don't directly explain this in the Upanishad, however they indicate it has to do with the soul after death. The 11 gates I've assumed then act as our automated judgement process for our souls after death.  \n\n\nAs I was listening to an audiobook version of the Upanishads is clicked, it seemed to be describing gates (kind of like logic gates in a computer) in which the soul has to travel through upon death. Each of these gates are within the body, and are a part of our \"judgement\".  \n\n\nThis is perhaps why the sins are considered 'deadly', and Baha'U'llah's birds of prey, are those that prey on the soul (The Soul being a Bird in a Cage).  \n\n\nEvery thought we think, every word we speak, every action we enact, every moment of our existence, every second, all go through these gates. The gates ensure purity of the soul in the divine realm, such that we don't bring any sinful behaviour, any corruption, or selfish desire into Heaven. The more virtue we employ, and subsequently the less attachment and sin we habitually practice, the more of our experiences, knowledge, friendships and existence we can bring into the divine realm.\n\nWhen we die, our soul and all our experiences will go through these gates.\n\n**The Seven Deadly Sins**  \nAny experience of wrath, will not get through the **Gate of Wrath**.  \nAny experiences of pride will not get through the **Gate of Pride**.  \nAny experience of gluttony will not get through the **Gate of Gluttony.**  \nAny experience of envy will not get through the **Gate of Envy.**  \nAny experience of sloth will not get through the **Gate of Sloth.**  \nAny experience of greed will not get through the **Gate of Greed.**  \nAny experience of lust will not get through the **Gate or Lust.**  \n\n\n**Four Birds of Prey**  \nAny fear will not get through the **Gate of Fear**.  \nAny attachment will not get through the **Gate of Attachment.**  \nAny desire will not get through the **Gate of Desire**.  \nOnly the knowledge we have obtained will pass through the **Gate of Ignorance.**\n\nEverything else will remain a mystery.\n\nWhat is left of our soul, is what we bring to the divine realm. The rest of our life experiences are purged, or erased, unable to pass through the gates.  \n\n\nWhat this means, is that if we want more of our life's experience to come with us into the divine realm, we must focus on the **700 virtues (Kindness, Patience, Justice, Mercy, Love, Wisdom, Knowledge, Charity, Chastity, Steadfastness etc)** and practice them daily as Jesus exemplified having being created to be in the perfect image of God, and have been exemply practiced by the other manifestations of God; The Bab, Baha'U'llah, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, and Muhammad (to the degree he could given the culture he was born into).\n\nIf we practice these 700 virtues daily, we need not worry as much about the 11 city gates, however we should always practice the virtues of being **watchful** and **vigalent** of the Birds of Prey **(Attachment, Fear, Inattention, Ignorance)**, and the Deadly sins **(Pride, Wrath, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Envy, Sloth)**.\n\nAs each of our experience that are embodied by a virtue will pass through the gates, to the degree they aren't tainted by the deadly sins or the birds of prey.  \n\n\nSo when we pass on from this realm, and are reborn in the Divine Realm. If we have worked hard, and brought many lessons, we can bring forward many attributes, qualities, and be more human.  \n\n\nIf we have lived a life of sin, selfishness, attachment, then we with so much of our experiences stuck at the gates, we might go back a stage or two, becoming a divine animal, a divine tree, or a divine rock.\n\nAs the Ruhi Book 1 mentions, in the world of the womb, we develop our limbs and senses, but we don't need those limbs and senses in the world of the womb. We need them for the Earthly World.\n\nSo too in the Earlth World, we develop our virtues and understanding, such that we can increase our capacity to know and serve God. We don't 'need' them in this realm, but in the Divine Realm, if we haven't developed them. It would be akin to not having developed eyes, ears, nose, or limbs. Or worse, we might regress in our development and become a divine animal, divine plant, or divine rock\/mineral.  \n\n\nIt's up to you where you direct your souls infinite energy in this life, toward selfish pleasures and sin, or toward the development of character, understanding, capacity to serve and the subsequent joy that follows.  \n\n\nThe 7 deadly sins and 4 birds of prey beget a life of pleasure.\n\nPracticing virtue, developing knowledge and wisdom, and serving others, will bring a life of joy.\n\nThis can all be summarised by a quote by Jesus that took me a long while to understand what it meant.\n\n**Matthew 7:13-14**  \n*\"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.\"*\n\n**The Narrow Gate** is that of selfless service to humanity, to all of God's children, and to become a truth seeker, to seek to understand God.\n\n**The Wide Gate** is that of Desire, Attachment to this Physical Realm, Pursuit of Passion, Greed, Lust, Excessive Pride, Willful ignorance. That's why Jesus said the gate that leads to destruction is wide and the road broad, as many will unconsciously follow it. Now given our obsession with our phones, we are losing our capacity to pay attention, and without attention, we cannot focus on what will benefit us in the divine realm.","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1677053443.0},{"title":"Beej mantras vs Shabar Mantras?","author":"numerousidentitty","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/hinduism\/comments\/118ixhq\/beej_mantras_vs_shabar_mantras\/","text":"Where to begin?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677023079.0},{"title":"Which mantra is this?","author":"stickytreesap","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/hinduism\/comments\/118kwib\/which_mantra_is_this\/","text":"What mantra is this?

This faith as we practice today has stood its test against time. Once it were the great philosophers like Shankaracharya or Ramanujacharya who through their scholarly wit reformed and revived Hinduism, then it were the brave Rajput and gurjars and Southern India kings who resisted the Arab invasion in 8th century. But perhaps, the greatest test for Hinduism during the 1600s-1700s, when the Mughal empire became more orthodox and Aurangzeb became the king. The Rajputs were also subdued. In South, the vijayanagar empire got defeated and the Nizam sultanate, Qutub Shahi and Adil Shahi sultanate were dominant. These kings were bigoted to core and treated Hindus like infidels. The polytheists were their enemies and they swore to destroy all our temples and idols. This was very much rampant, but hadn't been for this person, the religion we today are practicing would be very much non existent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1g5tktk7b4ja1.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70d37e583a442ce3209a84e998f399781252be31)\n\nOn 19th February, 1630. A ray of hope shone on us. Shivaji Bhosale took birth in Shivneri fort to Jijabai and Shahaji Bhosale. Since birth, he showed signs of being a great king. Nurtured by his mother, he learnt several scriptures like the puranas, Ramayana and Mahabharata. In his teenage years only, he swore to protect his land from invaders and instill swarajya or self rule. At the age of 16, he conquered his first fort which is Torna. Slowly, slowly he gained the trust of people around him and of course, of the common people. As time passed, his glory and strength increased. Having defeated Afzal Khan, with an army much smaller than his, he created his first breakthrough. He was a force to be reckoned. Slowly, he started to challenge the hegemony of Mughal Empire. Although he was defeated in the battle of Purandhar, he went to Agra and stood up bravely against Aurangzeb. Something like that had never happened. Aurangzeb humiliated Maharaj and had him under home arrest. These were dark times, he had lost quite the number of forts. But this didn't stop him, he with his extensive network and immense intelligence, escaped the house arrest. He went back to his kingdom and recaptured all the forts within a year. On 6th June, 1674. he was crowned as the Chhatrapati (sovereign king) in raigad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f8xd3h5tb4ja1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d7a4047b33507a7b722277b638d5ee95e294df33\n\nHis coronation happened according to vedic rites, something that hadn't been done since centuries. \n\nMughals weren't his only adversaries. He subdued the adil shahi and nizam of hyderabad. His empire was not only surrounded by Islamic bigots, but also by the foreign, European powers. If one end, he had to take care of the mughals, in the coast, he had to take care of the Portuguese, Dutch and the English. Shivaji Maharaj was the one who saved the Hindus in Goa from getting converted forcefully to Christianity and saved all the temples there from the vile Portuguese who terrorized the local Hindus there. He is also probably the first person to sense the wicked nature of British and their intentions on this land. \n\nShivaji Maharaj was also one of the first kings to realise the importance of a strong navy and naval bases not just for trade or offense but also for defense. He created such a strong navy along the western coast of India that it intimidated the European invaders who were forced to follow Shivaji Maharaj's rules. That's why today, he is known as the father of Modern Navy in India. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/50vwjvoid4ja1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1baf151e304739b42c4c9c8db7762344a34a1999\n\nAs I said, he is the protector of Hinduism and Hindu culture. If he wouldn't have been there, all our temples and idols would probably destroyed. He rebuilt many temples and patronised them as well. He reconverted many others back to Hinduism something that was seen as a taboo. He replaced Persian with Sanskrit or Marathi as the court language. \n\nHe was known as \"Jantachya Raja\" which means king of the people. He abolished Jagirdari and many oppressive taxation and made policies for the farmers. He cared for his subjects deeply. This is probably one of the reasons, he was loved by everyone. Even a child was ready to die for him, for Swarajya. He was also the person to stop slave trade.  \n\n> ***\u201cIn the days of the Moorish (Muslim) govt, it was allowed for you to buy male slaves and female slaves here, and to transport the same, without anyone preventing that. But now you may not, as long as I am master of these lands\u201d*** '\n\nShivaji Maharaj deeply respected women. During those times, it was very common to take females as war booties and prices. He clearly instructed his armies to not take children and women as prisoners. His enemies were relieved of getting captured by Marathas as they knew, Shivaji would treat all their sisters and mothers as his own. Once one general in the Maratha empire molested a woman, and when Shivaji Maharaj like an Ideal king, had him expelled as soon as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zz3tfn1nf4ja1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=61a6ffbc820ac0b1ea39d94fd1f3f818fe36f98a\n\nShivaji Maharaj was probably the closest king to Maryada Purushottam, Shri Rama. He had the intelligence of Chanakya with the bravery of Maharana Pratap. He never discriminated against anyone on the basis of their gender or caste. He was the protector of the Brahmins as well as of the Shudras. Shivaji Maharaj died in 1680 but his successors carried on the message of Swarajya and didn't succumb to Aurangzeb. He served as the inspiration not only to the entire Maratha Empire, but also to the freedom fighters against British. From Rabindranath Tagore to Lokmanya Tilak, all revered Shivaji and his ideals. \n\nThere is a quote by Kavi Bhushan,  ***\u0915\u093e\u0938\u0940\u0939\u0941\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0932\u093e \u0917\u092f\u0940 \u092e\u0925\u0941\u0930\u093e \u092e\u0936\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u092f\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0935\u093e\u091c\u0940 \u0928 \u0939\u094b \u0924\u094b \u0938\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0924 \u0938\u092c\u0915\u0940 \u2018***   which means  **Aurangzeb destroyed temple of Kashi , he also converted temple of mathura to mosque. But If Shivaji was\u2019t born , Every one might have got converted to Islam.**\n\n**Our** deepest respects to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who not only saved Hinduism but also gave us ideals to strive and aim for. He is the symbol of resistance and self respect. I would like to end this long post by a poem dedicated to him \n\n \n\n>\u0907\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u091c\u093f\u092e \u091c\u0902\u092d \u092a\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0935 \u091c\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0902 \u0905\u0902\u092d \u092a\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u0935\u0928 \u0938\u0926\u0902\u092d \u092a\u0930 \u0930\u0918\u0941\u0915\u0941\u0932\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0939\u0948\u0964   \n>  \n>\u092a\u094c\u0928 \u092c\u093e\u0930\u093f\u092c\u093e\u0939 \u092a\u0930 \u0938\u0902\u092d\u0941 \u0930\u0924\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0939 \u092a\u0930 \u091c\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0902 \u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u092c\u093e\u0939\u0941 \u092a\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091c\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0939\u0948\u0964   \n>  \n>\u0926\u093e\u0935\u093e \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0941\u092e\u0926\u0902\u0921 \u092a\u0930 \u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e \u092e\u0943\u0917\u091d\u0941\u0901\u0921 \u092a\u0930 \u092d\u0942\u0937\u0928 \u092c\u093f\u0924\u0941\u0902\u0921 \u092a\u0930 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0943\u0917\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0939\u0948\u0964   \n>  \n>\u0924\u0947\u091c \u0924\u092e-\u0905\u0902\u0938 \u092a\u0930 \u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0939 \u091c\u093f\u092e \u0915\u0902\u0938 \u092a\u0930 \u092f\u094c\u0902 \u092e\u0932\u0947\u091a\u094d\u091b-\u092c\u0902\u0938 \u092a\u0930 \u0938\u0947\u0930 \u0938\u093f\u0935\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0939\u0948\u0965   \n>  \n>which means   \n>  \n>**Like Lord Indra against the demon Jambhasur, like Underwater volcano over the Ocean, like Lord Ram of the Raghu clan against the boastful Ravan**  \n>  \n>**As strong winds scatter the clouds, as lord Shiva destoyed Rati's Husband (kaamdev),  like Lord Parashurama destroyed Sahastrabahu**  \n>  \n>**Like fire which burns woods, like a cheetah on a herd of deers, like a tiger on a group of hogs,**  \n>  \n>**Like a ray of light dispels the darkness, Like krishna upon kansa, so upon the clan of Mllecchas( Invaders), has descended King Shivaji, the tiger.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5027l66mk4ja1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82959346c42f6e145e76e6f5b49fbd0d7828b45d","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676803725.0},{"title":"Can I read Hanuman Chalisa in the evening if I ate non veg in the afternoon?

We have heard how if other religions are food items than Hinduism is a frickin 100 page menu , you can choose literally any form you want including atheism, it's restricting like Islam , while being free at the same time . Sometimes it feels like some dude or a group just put their own beliefs out there ,Hinduism don't have a founder or a keeper to see what is going in and out . Even modern concepts like nihilism are addressed here . It's surprising the way it describes human emotions and habits , because the way it does give strong collage textbooks vibes rather than religious ( there are some which involves gods and rituals ) and the contradictions feel like different opinions from a debate . \n\nIt's good how broad minded this term Hinduism is , funny how i can call myself hindu and atheist at the same time , if i am a mentally strong guy then it's thanks to Hinduism ( reading bhagwat gita and philo scripts really helped me to face people in reality)\n\nBeing so open does have its disadvantages, like anything can become part of Hinduism just take things like sati , child marriages and caste system. Places like Europe and Japan too had their version of caste system, but they were able to completely demolish it , while here it got assimilated in peoples religion, so people couldn't really let go of it . \n\nAlso so many contradictions made me feel like, if there is a god he doesn't care about humans \/ he is not serious","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676825788.0},{"title":"Greatness of Lord Shiva - Mahashivratri \u0950","author":"Devinco001","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/h68rlsfy51ja1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676762401.0}]
