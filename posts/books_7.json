But it made me want to check other books and I forgot that I had 2 fairy tales Home University volumes.\n\nIt kinda made me feel slightly sad that its value is so much lower than its quality. It's leather bound, with really pretty illustrations, the printing quality is good too, and the fact that it withstood like 80 years, it's something. If it were reprinted today, with the same quality as it was, it'd be worth at least 10 times more.\n\nBooks are like people I believe, a Colleen Hoover book might mean differently to different people, its value depends entirely on who's holding the book and appreciating them. And it kinda makes me sad that it's gonna be hard to find a new owner for the books because idt anyone I'm related to would be able to fully appreciate them (including me bc the subject is not my cup of tea). I really REALLY should cut down on purchasing physical books tbh",

        "text": "Hello! I stumbled upon a FANTASTIC book of all of Alexander Pushkin’s drawings that he did over the course of his writing career. Unfortunately, this copy was $95  ($75 bc of a sale) at the rare book seller I found it at. Way too over budget for me! I am dying to see if this book is available anywhere else, but I can’t find it!! I have photos attached below. It was published in 1999, and I think the publisher is Voskresen’e. Please help!!\n\n[Book photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/QBQ2PWB)",

        "text": "Early reflections:  about 20% done, I just finished Auerbach’s Celler for those that remember the scene. \n\nFirst of all Faust is a play written as rhymed verse and presents itself essentially as poetry.  I am reading it aloud to myself each night which can be loads of fun because Faust is highly entertaining, and often quite hilarious. \n\nThere are passages that can be hard to parse, but then a character will come out and say just that, so don’t worry, you’re in good hands with von Goethe, he knows the path he’s taking you down. \n\nI’m surprised by how readable and funny it is.  If you’ve read The Master and Margarita you’ll get the same feel here, a romp with the devil, which is only natural as it was Bulgakov’s inspiration. \n\n\nI’m reading the George Madison Priest translation. \n\nAnother bonus is the Illustrations, a beautiful Franklin Library Edition (the green on from 1981) which can be had at a pretty reasonable price.",

I remember what's written in the book for a few days, if I try to recall what was in the book after a few weeks it's even harder for me to recall the story's main character's name. What can I do? Also, I feel that I am not reading any books in a proper way. I just read it for the sake of reading (if I could put it that way). what are the techniques you folks follow to get the most out of the book? \n\nI know that reading can change my life but I don't find it interesting to read, probably I don't know the proper way of reading. So, that's why I have reached out to you guys.  Help this poor guy by sharing tips, techniques, and wisdom.",
