I also understand that we can see our own galaxy but from a more linear position due to where our solar system is located. However, if our planet was in a more densely populated corner of the universe, could we potentially see the giant spiraling dust and star formations of another galaxy? \n\nHopefully I’m wording this question correctly.",

And if life developed on a planet with similar conditions to Earth, wouldn’t it just look very similar to life here? That would be pretty boring to be honest.\n\nUnless the criteria we using looking is only for planets that support just OUR conditions, then it would make sense if there were other planets that don’t support our conditions, but support their own conditions &amp; therefore life there would look different.\n\nBut Idk I have been wondering this for a while and couldn’t find an answer on the internet.\n\nLmk what you think, thanks!",

        "text": "It was sometime during my Freshman year of college, which was 1998-1999. I was in Jackson, Tennessee. I am not sure what time of the year it was or even what time of the day it was. I know that it was late enough to be dark outside, but it could have been 8pm or 5am.\n\nSomeone told people to come outside, because there was a \"meteor shower\" going on. A few of us rushed outside of our dorm (more like an apartment) to check it out and it was like nothing I had ever seen up that point of my life and I still haven't seen anything close since then. I had seen a \"meteor shower\" once during a cruise and I had spotted a few random \"shooting stars\" before and those all looked similar to each other. They were just quick, very tiny, streaks of white light that lasted not even half a second. They were always so quick that you would never have time to point them out to anyone else that may have not been paying attention. If you blinked, you missed them. I had also seen the Hale-Bopp comet, but that seemed like it was visible for weeks straight (maybe longer?) and was basically just a stationary white light with small tail in the sky. This particular \"meteor shower\" was different though!\n\nThese were slow moving colorful streaks of light that spanned the entire length of the sky. The streaks were as wide as my thumb held at an arms length away from my eyes. It seemed like the streaks took approximately 3 seconds to go across the entire sky and they stayed visible for another couple of seconds until they would fade away starting with the point where the streak began in the sky and finishing with the freshest part of the streak eventually fading away. I saw maybe 5-10 of these streaks and they ranged in color from red to green to blue.\n\nAt the time I remember thinking that the previous \"meteor shower\" I had seen must have been a REALLY lame one, because this one was a real site to behold. I have seen several meteor showers since then and they are always equally as lame as the first one I saw on the cruise. Some of them have a higher frequency or more \"shooting stars\" to see, but they are always the same very quick white streaks of light that don't last any time at all.\n\nWhy was this meteor shower in college so impressive and visually unique from anything I've ever seen in the sky? Was it a rare occurrence? Was I lucky to see it once in my life or will I have a chance to see something like it again? What exactly was I looking at anyway? I have never heard anyone else describe anything like this before. I have tried to describe what I saw as best as I could, but if you have more specific questions I can try to explain in better detail.\n\nFwiw, no drugs or alcohol were involved.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "It can be argued that a telescope and a microscope are the same tool with  opposite targets. One focusing on the small and the other large. They  both work on magnification. General relativity addresses large objects  and the fabric of spacetime. Spacetime gets distorted and even produces  waves that travel across the universe. Quantum Mechanics addresses the  very small and makes predictions using the wave function. Please note,  there are waves in both areas of study which is where they are similar.  As with sound, radio and light: they are waves and as such, are subject  to interference, both destructive and constructive. Recently LIGO  observatory has detected gravitational waves which warp space and time.  Destructive waves are used in noise canceling headphones. With all of  these wave types permeating the universe, there is bound to be such  interference. These can potentially produce anomalies. When measuring  the universe via massive telescopes we do see anomalies. They have been  coined dark matter and dark energy. What if these anomalies are caused  by interference? Space does seem empty, yet it is full of waves. Waves  of light, gravitational waves, radio waves, microwaves and subatomic  waves. There are many ways to learn physics. Some are visual, such as  tree felling or use of Popsicle sticks and some are mathematical. I  personally am a visual learner. In physics, the term entropy is used. It  has been argued successfully that entropy, disorder or heat change will  reach equilibrium eventually. AQUAL hypothesis has some ground. What I  am proposing is dark matter is not real, nor is dark energy. People much  smarter then I am are also challenging this assumption. I am proposing, the very  beginning of an idea, to take in consideration wave interference to  address the discrepancies observed. The true shape of our  universe has been argued over. I might be missing some relevant information but I have spent a lot of time (many years of collecting knowledge) to reach this thought. Wave interference has been proven.",
