        "text": "We're nothing like the the Slashdot-ers of yore. We're *positive*, not *toxic*, about Linux because we want to encourage everyone to use Linux.\n\nOur expectation (and pitch) for Linux is that it is a quasi-orgasmic, quasi-religious desktop experience where stars have aligned (developers, who?) to give us the most perfect, most secure, most free (as in freedom) desktop OS.  For beginners to the most advanced users alike.\n\nAnd when our expectations are not met, when minor wrinkles begin to show themselves, we know the answer -- we can just Karen about it on Reddit, because it's the internet and snaps are awful, amiright?  \n\nBecause what is really most toxic is the reality, that Linux is just the modern and free incarnation of Unix.  That like Unix its composable, not polished.  That mostly well-meaning companies and people like developing and believe in free software, but also don't mind making money.  Because they are mostly not totally impractical psychos.  That free software has been a marvelous boon but also can be and has been a disappointment in many ways. That it's cheap and the economics of cheap are not as good as were those of expensive.\n\nBut, cheer up, this is the internet!  Of course, we can live the fantasy.  Because it makes us feel like little Che Guevaras.  Each complaint about snaps reads like a transcription from guerilla radio... but also a station that's perfect for even your grandmother.  She would probably love Linux Mint...",

I know there is a thing called WINE that can run windows, but lets give an example of what I mean. I use RivaTuner for gaming to get the framerate and frametime where I want. But would you be able to do that in WINE easily since its a windows program interacting with another windows program? Or would you just have to run a virtual machine?

        "text": "ZTGPS is a Linux+KDE native PIM application satisfying the same purpose as Garmin's \"BaseCamp\" software, which does not run on Linux. ZTGPS provides sophisticated query and sorting capabilities for GPS tracks. It is targeted at cyclists, runners, hikers, and anyone collecting GPS tracks from handheld units, particularly if you prefer data storage on your own computer to cloud based storage. A feature description and FAQ is available on the web site below. Binary packages for several popular distros are available under the Downloads tab.\n\nVersion 1.13 includes Version 1.13 includes usability improvements for UI and documentation searchability, direct speed editing in tracks, new track editing options such as time reversal, improved track and point merge feature, map pane interactivity improvements, and various bug fixes.minor improvements.\n\n* [ZombieTrackerGPS web site](https://www.zombietrackergps.net/ztgps/)\n* [gitlab source repo](https://gitlab.com/ldutils-projects/zombietrackergps)\n\nThe web site's first gallery image is a UI screenshot which you can click to get a bigger version, if you want to quickly see what you're in for.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecent changes:\n\n**Version 1.13**\n\n* Usability: The in-app documentation browser now supports searching. The standard ZTGPS query language is available, e.g, with booleans, parentheses, and regular expressions. The page browser will subset to the patches matching the query, and matching items highlighted. Return moves to the next match.\n* Usability: Similar search functionality is available in the program configuration window. The configuration UI elements will be searched.\n* Editing: Point speed is obtained from collected per-point data or calculated from locations and timestamps. It is now possible to directly edit point speed, which will change the timestamps of all subsequent points in the track. See the new documentation page under Track Editing/Changing Speed for more information.\n* Editing: Measured point speed can be unset, falling back to the distance vs time calculation.\n* There is a new Reverse Track edit feature which does what it says on the tin.\n* The track line pane was not updating when point data changed for the track being displayed. Now it does.\n* Fixed handling of backslash-escaped quotes in query strings. Other minor fixes to query tokenization.\n* In rare circumtances, it was possible to cause a crash with out-of-time-order points in a track.\n* The Merge feature has been improved and expanded. Selecting multiple segments in a PointPane will merge those segments. Selecting multiple points will merge the points into an average of the selected points. Points cannot be merged across segments. The old \"Merge Segments\" feature was a subset of this improvement and has been removed.\n* Track points are displayed during point selection (e.g, in a Point Pane) even if \"Draw Track Points\" is disabled in the Interactive Movement Behavior setting. That means you can see which point(s) you have selected even if points are disabled during map panning for performance reasons.\n* Added missing units indicators for HR, Cad, and Temp, while editing data in a PointPane.\n* If a track segment (not the points within) was selected in a Point Pane, the Zoom-To feature was was broken. It now works correctly.\n* Minor improvements to map pane behavior after certain edit operations.\n* Improvements to end-of-segment point data, to prevent speeds and distances from carrying across segments. Segments now fully divide the track.\n* Removed TZ dependency from test suite.\n\nFor older changes, see the [History](https://zombietrackergps.net/ztgps/history.html) page.",

Simply typing\n\n`$jinbe COMMAND`\n\nwill run COMMAND at system boot. \n\n`$jinbe list `\n\nlists all your startup scripts and you can add or remove them easily.\n\nThe same developer has also created another handy utiluty called [Joker](https://github.com/txthinking/joker). \n\nIt allows you run any command in backgrond and turn it into a daemon. \n\nManaging background tasks is very easy just type:\n\n`$joker list`\n\n`$joker stop`\n\n`$joker restart`",

        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zorjwi/linux_interrupt_handling_overview_part_1/",
        "text": " After talking in general about the concept of interrupts ([https://medium.com/@boutnaru/computer-architecture-interrupts-9d0dc849c1e5](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/computer-architecture-interrupts-9d0dc849c1e5)) now we are going to deep dive into how they are handled under Linux.\n\nIn order to handle an interrupt we first need to register it using a call to “request\\_irq” which adds the handler ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/include/linux/interrupt.h#L165](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/include/linux/interrupt.h#L165)). In order to remove a handler we call “free\\_irq”. Fun fact, “request\\_irq” is referenced in 1280 files in the source code of the Linux kernel (version 6.1). \n\nOverall, we can think about two major use cases when we are handling interrupts. First, interrupts that are designed to execute quickly. Second, interrupts which have to do several operations to complete (meaning they won’t execute quickly).\n\nDue to that, interrupt handling has two phases (by the way it is true not only for Linux). We have “Top Half” and “Bottom Half”. The main reason for the split is the fact that we can’t perform large operations in interrupt-context (when interrupts are disable). So, what “Bottom Half” allows us is to defer work for later. For more information I suggest reading [https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Interrupts/linux-interrupts-9.html](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Interrupts/linux-interrupts-9.html).  \n\nWe can sum up the phases of a “Top Half” as follows: ensure that the interrupt was triggered by the correct hardware (in case of line sharing), clearing interrupt pending bit on the hardware (if needed), does everything that needs to be immediate (like reading/writing to/from the device) and schedule the “Bottom Half” (if needed).  As an example we can see the interrupt handler for a floppy ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/drivers/block/floppy.c#L1712](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/drivers/block/floppy.c#L1712)) that calls the deferred work in the following line [https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/drivers/block/floppy.c#L1765](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/drivers/block/floppy.c#L1765). \n\nThus, “Top Half” runs in an interrupt context, which is used for quick responses to external events and it is responsible for creating the deferred work for later (the “Bottom Half”) - as we can see in the timeline diagram shown below.\n\nLastly, We have three types for the category of “Bottom Half”: workques, tasklets and softirq ([https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596002130/ch04s07.html](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596002130/ch04s07.html)). We will dive into each one of them in future writeups. By the way, there are also timers and normal regular kernel threads that can be used for deferred work but they are less natural for interrupt handling so I won’t go over them in this series. \n\nNext we are going to start diving into workques, tasklets and softirq. See you in the next writeup :-). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/hugh712.gitbooks.io\\/embeddedsystem\\/content\\/Images\\/RealTime\\/RT006.png](https://preview.redd.it/b0qdysk4kl6a1.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e09b42b02aeb56b093b9a9af1eb32b90a92217e)",

Though, I really like ideas behind Rust language, I think it introduces great risks to Linux future: Rust's learning curve is very steep, so in a few years we might end up with more and more developers deciding to go away from Linux kernel to some new fancy Google kernel. Nowadays Linux is pretty simple, written mostly in C and ASM, and it is REALLY enjoyable to use. Since I am on my own not a professional Linux kernel dev, I won't bother with learning Rust. And if there is Rust code in my module of interest, I will just take something else (*BSD or some RTOS) to use in my project. So, I am wondering will there be Rust-free versions?",

Well, I threw an SSD in it a long time ago and recently set it up with Ubuntu Server. My kids wanted a Minecraft server so I watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIHiRW4QH6I&amp;t=1636s) and followed the instructions..... but that kind of opened a can of worms. Now I want to explore more but I'm not sure how to find the answers I'm looking for. I hope I have come to the right place and please forgive me if this is a stupid question. \n\nSo the Minecraft server is up and running but I was looking into adding a NAS to my home network too, but I do not have another spare PC lying around to install TruNAS on or any other NAS software. Is there a way I can install a NAS OS or NAS software as a docker container (not sure if that's what it's called) so the Minecraft server and the NAS software are running together? I know that it'll be pushing the limits of this PC as just running the server has the CPU usage at 80%, but I at least want to try and this is all I have now. I have a spare 10 GB hard drive and I want to try to experiment with linux and see if I can make it work. I'm not going to be putting anything on this NAS that's critical because I won't have a true backup, nor will I be running anything in RAID. \n\nAny information will be greatly appreciated!",

Sadly the audio quality sucks donkey shit. Spicetify is god sent and Spotify really taps into each and everyone taste in music. Plus, with a while collections of songs, it's great right? Nope\nRemember HiFi Spotify? Remember 2021 when it's supposed to be out? Remember the atrocious 19.99 dollars a month for that crappy shit? Remember now it's 2022 and nothing to be seen? I just hate and love Spotify at the same time. At least I have music while chilling on my PC\n\nApple Music, the ecosystem. Never like Apple though I agreed and admired them at some points. And Apple Music is one of them. With the mere price of 9.99 you get up to 24/192 khz, Dolby Atmos which is not something I would call \"excellent\" but it's a plus. It even gets more ridiculous with students discount. The selection of music is plenty and UI is decent. What a steal, but I have to create an Apple ID and they made me hand out my birthday which I lied and now after some \"oh shee, what is my password again?\" My account is now disabled and I have to fill in the FUCJING birthday which I MADE UP. So fuc you Apple, you little sht. Apple Music on Tux huh? May I introduce you to....CIDER. It is so good, it's bad. No lossless quality so...again why does everything has to be suck\nApple music on Windows?? No fuc you, wait until next year so we can say, oops it's gonna be out in 2023, promise. \n\nTidal, this is the end game. 19.99 a month heh? Tidal what the heck? Tidal heh? Not available in some countries?? Doesn't even have most songs. Even with students discount, its laughable. Tidal on web sometimes work, sometimes doesn't in terms lossless quality. There are clients for the Tux though. \n\nI'm left with...let see........NOTHING. \nIt's 2022 and music streaming still sucks. Meanwhile, movies streaming is laughing at us like fools. You can even buy Blue-rays which are widely available. Pricing is good and you and torrent the vast majority of things.",
