        "text": "So, a while back I did switchboard for a major luxury apartment management company. Basically, whatever anyone needed from management, or one of the buildings, I'd direct them to the right person, or solve their problem if I could.\n\nThe family that owns the company have NY history, and a lot, lot, lot of money. They've donated whole wings to local hospitals, and they own a lot of businesses, and stock in even more businesses. They're a pretty big name in real estate here.\n\nAnyway, the CEO had been on the board of some medical research company, mostly because he was a major provider of money for that research company, not because he personally made decisions for them or even with them. However, the company was sold and the board dissolved, and the researchers had to give up 20something chimpanzees that were being kept for medical testing. Their conditions as test subjects were probably really great, but now that the research was over, the chimps might end up 'homeless' and were being sent to zoos or something I don't remember. The reason I don't remember is because in no way is the building management division of the CEO's holdings involved in any way with medical research or rehousing chimpanzees.\n\nBut when the news broke, a lot of people were very, very personally offended by my CEO's \"decision to get rid of the monkeys\" and there were some protests at his home, and several of his workplaces. \n\nHere's the rub - when you google the company name, which is the CEO's name, you get my desk number. Right up front and first. This was usually only an issue when people wanted to call their front desk and were too lazy to look at the signs in all of the apartments, hallways, and notes on all the building documents ever to find the number, and instead would just search for the company online and call the first thing that showed up. I'd kindly let them know that this was the office, not their building, and that I have no effect on their dry cleaning delivery/ roof rental / internet connectivity, and then give them their desk number and boom - job done. \n\nHowever, on this day, I was held personally accountable for the sufferings of multiple disenfranchised chimpanzees. My favorite call was this: \n\nCPL (crazy peta lady) : IS THIS MR. REDACTED? \n\nMe: No, sorry ma'am, this is a condo management association.\n\nCPL: I FOUND THIS NUMBER LOOKING FOR MR. REDACTED, HE IS KILLING CHIMPS.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, while he is the owner of this company, he is never, ever in this office and certainly not sitting at the reception desk. \n\nCPL: GIVE ME HIS CELL NUMBER.\n\nMe: Even if I had Mr. Redacted's personal cell number, I would not be allowed to disseminate it. \n\nCPL: YOU ARE KILLING CHIMPS. WHY DO YOU HATE NATURE?\n\nMe: Ma'am, I assure you that not only have I never seen or harmed a chimpanzee, I have literally never seen one in person. I am sure they are great.\n\nCPL: MURDERER! \n\nAt that point I hung up, and the phone IMMEDIATELY rang again. The next 9 calls I got were all primate-related, although most people were willing to accept that Mr. Redacted didn't run his chimp-killing operation from the reception desk of a condo building and apologized (but some did not). I got permission from my supervisor to not answer the phone for external calls for the rest of the day when the DOOR swung open and I kid. you. not.\n\nIt was crazy peta lady. \n\nCPL: Where is REDACTED. HE IS KILLING ANIMALS.\n\nMe: Holy shit...(pressing the panic button under my desk)\n\nCPL: ARE YOU THE GIRL KILLING MONKEYS?\n\nMe: Lady I have NEVER met a chimp, let alone harmed one. Please stop screaming. We rent apartments here. \n\nCPL: FROM YOUR PROFITS FROM CHIMP KILLING\n\nAt which point concierge from next door carefully removed her. ",

        "text": "Yesterday I flunked one customer survey and partially flunked another one. This is unusual for me, last month all of my surveys were perfect.\n\nDuring the required coaching session my supervisor said that I sounded monotone and bored in one call, that I didn't express enough empathy in the other and I didn't build rapport with either customer. I apologized and said that I was having an off day that I'm already come back from it because I passed two other surveys and that the previous day was an anomaly. She said that it doesn't matter and that I need to make sure that every call is done right each time. Honest question, is that really possible?\n\nDisclaimer: I sometimes wonder if I am psychotic because I have no empathy for a customer who's phone isn't working correctly. It's my job to help them and I'll do it to the best of my abilities but I do have to force my self to say empathetic statements. Also I do have a naturally monotone voice so I do have to force myself to add emotion and tone for the customer to hear. On certain days I will not be in the mood to inflect my voice and I might legitimately forget to acknowledge customer's emotions. But I'm still going to do my job and help the customer as much as possible and always be polite. I've literally never failed a survey because a person didn't like me, it's always because they wanted something that I couldn't give them. \n\nIn the year that I've been with my company 3 of my supervisors were rude on a daily basis and 2 others  would intermittently have days where they were rude to the entire team. Is it really reasonable for a supervisor to expect me to be perky, empathetic and to \"connect\" with each and every customer all day, everyday, five days a week when they can't seem to do the same to their team?",

        "text": "Background of my current job. I work in a call center where I take 401(k) calls from employees of companies who use the company I work for as a Recordkeeper. As part of my job, I have access to very sensitive information. Callers have to use a user ID and pin through our IVR system to come in authorized where we don't have to go through so much information. If they don't, we need them to provide the last 4 of their SSN. As you all know, it's to protect that sensitive information. \n\nSo, today I received the following call:\n\nMe: thank you for calling (company name) my name is (my name), can I please have the last 4 digits of your social security number?\n\nCaller(who btw has a British accent): My name is (gives full name) did all of my information come up there?\n\nMe: no ma'am, you came in without any information. I need you to provide me the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number and your last name for me to proceed and pull up your information. \n\nCaller: *yells over to her \"partner\"* hey honey can you grab my purse, my social security card is in there. *back to me* well what if I give you my address?\n\nme: Sorry ma'am but as per (company name) policy, I need you to provide me with either the last 4 of your SSN and your last name, or your full SSN for me to be able to proceed with this call and to pull up your information. you did not come in verified with any information, so I need you to provide this. \n\nSo, she keeps going on about how she's in England, says some b/s about how she supposedly went to school with Adele (I call b/s on that stuff), asks where I'm from, and starts talking about British shows and that I'm so patient and calm. I thank her and she then tries to give me some numbers\n\nCaller: let me think *after trying to get her \"partner\" to get her gucci bag* xxx-xx-xxxx\n\nMe *after entering this \"number\" into the system and no results come up* I am sorry ma'am but when I enter this information in, it comes up with no search results. \n\nCaller: please bear with me. *silence for a couple seconds* maybe it's yyy-yy-yyyy. \n\nMe: *enters this into our system, no results show up* Again, I am sorry ma'am but it appears that this does not come up with any information. \n\nCaller: Well, I would like to speak with a manager, I really need to get into this account, I need to buy a buggy. a black porsche\n\nMe: *thinking... welp here's some b--ch trying to steal identity* Well.. I can see what I can do ma'am, but for us to continue or pull up this information, as per our company policy and to be able to proceed and protect our participants' information, we do need you to provide us with the last 4 of your ssn and last name, or full SSN. This is all per our security protocol. \n\nCaller: Well, this is why I moved to England, they're a bit more... lax on their security policy. I would still like to speak with a manager or someone. \n\nMe: ok Ma'am, If you don't mind holding, I will see what I can do. \n\nSo, I place her on hold and am about to type something in our group chat in Lync to try to explain this to my supervisors to get someone higher up than me to explain how we CANNOT do anything unless she can provide us this information because we don't know if she's trying to steal some poor sap's identity. Say to myself \"I have no idea what to do with this one\". While I'm typing something in chat... She hangs up. \n\n\nSeriously, I've been doing this crap for over a year. Good luck getting past me with this. Thanks lady, you gave me a story. ",

We ended up back to back, which doesn't surprise me with how we didn't have phones for nearly 4 hours. \n\n\n\nThen I had a damn panic attack. It's been a while since I've had one, so I asked my manager to let me off the phones. My question to you all is: if this is a frequent enough occurrence, do I need to get a note from my doctor about it?

SHOULD I SUE YOU?\n\n*(at this point, I've handed in my notice. So you can sue me all you want, buddy. I won't even be here in 3 weeks. But I'm still here now, so I ask him the problem. it turns out his main gas supply pipe has water in it and his gas has been turned off until the water has been cleared out because this can be dangerous. This is nothing to do with us and *supplier needs to attend to clear out the water and turn the gas back on. I advise him of this, which does not go well)*\n\n&gt; Buttface: This needs to be fixed now!\n\n&gt; Me: I see, has *supplier attended your property?\n\n&gt; Buttface: No!\n\n&gt; Me: Okay, well if you call *supplier they will arrange to attend and solve this issue for you. Unfortunately, there's nothing that we can do for you from here at the moment.\n\n&gt; Buttface: Well let me tell you something, they have attended! And they said they won't do anything! I'm not calling them again! **YOU** need to do it!\n\n*sigh*, I don't know why he lied to me in the first place about whether they attended. It makes no difference to me at all.\n\n&gt; Buttface: Is this your boiler, or is it mine? Because if it's mine, I'm going to rip it off the wall and throw it out of the window!\n\n&gt; Me: Okay Mr Buttface, but I have to advise that you would be liable for any damage caused by those actions. If you do not wish to call *supplier again, I can call them on your behalf and - \n\n&gt; Buttface: NO! YOU WILL CALL THEM ON YOUR OWN BEHALF!\n\n&gt;Me:  Mr Buttface, I am not the one with the gas supply fault. Now as I have offered, I can call them on your behalf and arrange for them to attend *(this is not my job, and it's his own responsibility, but by this point we have been on the phone for around 7 minutes)*\n\n&gt; Buttface: Is this your boiler or is it my boiler? BECAUSE IF IT'S MY BOILER I'M GOING TO KICK IT TO DEATH!!!\n\nAt this point, I laughed. I'm pretty sure that's not how a boiler works, and the problem isn't with his boiler, it's his main gas supply which is not dealt with by us. At this point, he proceeded to go on a rant for another 5 minutes, but I just took off my headset because I was 100% done. Every time he paused, I repeated\n\n&gt; Okay Mr Buttface, I will call *supplier on your behalf today.\n\nEventually, he hung up. But not before telling me\n\n&gt;Buttface: You're useless, you're all useless. I hope you know I'm recording this call and I'm going to use it when I sue you! *(all calls are recorded)* \n\nI called the supplier, who advised that they have attended a few times this week and **he would not allow them access to carry out the work**. Nevertheless, they arranged to attend within a few hours and by 4pm he had his gas supply back on. I didn't even get a thank you for going out of my way to help someone who was such a twatwaffle. ",

        "text": "One of these days, I'm gonna compile the stories I've documented for the past 3 years of call center work (in 2 different call centers) and post a bunch of them for the amusement of all you fine folks, but for now, you get a new story from just the other day.\n\nAs I've said in my previous story, right now I work in a call center for medicare supplemental health insurance plans. Because of this particular line of work I get all kinds... from the providers who only follow a script and are lost if you break it to the angry children who don't understand what privacy is for or why it's necessary.\n\nThis particular caller was calling because she wanted to enroll in one of our plans. Now, I am not a sales agent myself but what I am supposed to do is verify their eligibility before transferring them to a sales agent. It's a real quick and precise hand off, all the information carries to the agent and they don't have to re-explain anything.\n\nSo she wanted to enroll and I went into my usual breakdown of what we need to do. So I go through her eligibility to enroll. This woman had been on medicare for years and still wasn't even 60 (general enrollment requires age 65 but in some states you can enroll before 65 under certain circumstances). \n\nSo as she did not meet the exception criteria, she was not eligible for one of our plans. Ohhhhhhh boy did this piss her off.\n\n* **Caller:** I was told there would be an exception for me because I lost coverage!\n\n* **Me:** oh ok so when did you lose coverage?\n\n* **Caller:** In 2010!\n\n* **Me:** ... There is no infinite window here. It's 6 months guaranteed acceptance, not 6 years!\n\n* **Caller:** That is not true! I have it in writing that I would get a plan for blahblahblahblah\n\n* **Me:** Ma'am, there is NO record of us sending you ANYTHING at all.\n\n* **Caller:** I spoke to a supervisor who said there would be an exception for me!\n\n* **Me:** There's also no record of a supervisor call on your account.\n\n* **Caller:** ... So what am I supposed to do now?!\n\n* **Me:** That's up to you, but you are not eligible for one of our plans at this time. \n\nHer tone shifted once I caught her in each of her lies and she became pleasant before hanging up gracefully. After she hung up I went to drop notes on her account, only to find she had called almost exactly a year earlier for the same reason and was told the exact same thing.",

        "text": "Based on a previous post, there was a lot of bashing of call center managers. Speaking as an ex-manager at a call center, we do have a clue as to what is going on. We see both the agent and the corporate side. The problem is the job/company is so ridiculously corporate that we have to follow and enforce the rules to an exact T.\n\n\nIt doesn't matter what the excuse was, if you missed work it went against your attendance. Ran to the bathroom for an emergency and it wasn't your break time? Against your adherence. Everything was set in stone and black and white. Now, cases might be different, but as a manager you had to follow exact disciplinary actions. There were very very few instances you could just fire someone straight away . Take attendance for example. Let's say you were allowed 10 absences before being fired, and you got 1 back every month.\n\n\nSomeone called in sick or left and used up 4 absences. That's a verbal warning. Sign and document. They call in 2 more times, that is a write up, 2 more times your on your final warning, then at ten you are fired. What would happen is you've had your final warning and then your car broke down, or your babysitter called in sick and you couldn't come to work. I hated these, because it made me look like the biggest asshole on the planet. No I don't want you to lose your job, I don't want to fire you, but it's your tenth absent so there's nothing I can do.\n\n\nNow that person goes around and tells everyone the call center or even my self hates babies and they got fired just because their babysitter called in sick. I hated hearing that shit. That's not true at all. They may have been the day that got them the 10th absence, but they had plenty of warnings and write ups and other days they used up.\n\n\nIf the manager wasn't organized and on top of things, they even got more days. Miss 3 days and get your verbal, then miss 7 more days? Your not fired, because your manager is required to give you a written and a final warning.\n\n\nThe purpose behind the black and white rules, and the low pay/salary cap for agents is simply because corporate believes desk agents are very replaceable. Been an agent for 10 years? Cool your capped at 12 bucks an hour, because we can bring Joe off the street and train him for 2 weeks and he can do the same job you've been doing for 10 years.\n\n\nWe had our center close because corporate refused to pay our agents more. You'd come to work and pass Taco Bell paying 13 an hour , Walmart paying 15, DQ paying 12...to go to your 9.50 an hour paying job of being a call center agent. We had meetings because we couldn't keep people employed and we had to come up with ideas to keep employees retained. They came up with games, candy prizes and other shit. Every meeting I stated, we need to pay people more. The cost of living here is higher. If we don't pay more, we won't have employees. Well corporate wouldn't do that, closed that center and switched to work at home and opened a center in a different state with a lower cost of living.\n\nSorry for the ramble, but just giving you the side of a call center manager. Most of them had a fucking clue, but they couldn't do a fucking thing about it. Feel free to ask any other questions you have. I'll gladly answer away.",

        "author": "throwaway256k",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/4n3hre/the_time_has_come_to_say_goodbye_from_a_former/",
        "text": "4 years with DirecTV under the Asurion contract. The time has come to say goodbye. I was handed termination papers today. Because I work at home and had to take shelter during a recent tornado. I failed to exit my phone properly and so I was in an undefined state (we use aux codes for everything, ie, aux 1 for break, aux 2 for lunch, 3 for sup meetings, etc) for a long period of time. So I was accused of call avoidance. That said, a few things I wanted to share, in case anyone happened to miss them. Directv is expensive. Overly so. Mike White was paid $12m in 2014. Just 2014. That's insane. But easy to figure when you think about the 20m customers, and how they pay $7 per receiver, even if you purchase your own RVU TV and add it to the service. Let me repeat that. You own the TV. It's yours. For some of you that means you make the credit card payments. Either way, it's not a DirecTV product. And they charge you $7 a month for the privilege of connecting it. And that's in addition to the $50 they charge you to install/connect that TV.\n\nNew customers. You have no option but HD equipment. And therefore you'll have an 'all included' package that's priced higher than the standard packages, or you pay an extra $15 advanced receiver fee that includes HD, dvr and whole home. Whether you use them or not. You'll also get promised visa cards and they'll get left off. Nothing can be done. But you're under contract. \n\nAll customers have a 'heart value'. This is calculated from time with us, payment amount and if you pay on time. It ranges from 0 - 5. This primarily controls how much we can give you for credits, recurring or otherwise. 5 hearts, we can sometimes give you $30 off for 12 months if you sign a 12 month agreement. 0 hearts... We can't even credit a service call. \n\nI worked in the protection plan dept. We had insane numbers to match. We had to get 2% of callers to buy the premier plan (for $12 additional per month) or we got in trouble. It wasn't easy. Figuring 60 callers a day, that's 24 a month. The issue was in that it began (when I was hired) at 5 per month. Then someone needed a new car so they upped it. So do my former coworkers a favor. Accept it. Wait a week then cancel it.\nOne thing to keep in mind, if you pay the $7.99 a month (or more), you will end up speaking to a protection plan specialist, who WILL push the premier or the premier with ADH (accidental damage from handling). We are/were required to. \n\nWe had callbacks. Oh lawdy the callbacks. Say you call in, ask about a new receiver because yours is bad. Then you wait 6 days, call back to order a pay per view. Unrelated, long time, but DTV does not care. That's a callback. Better yet, you call back twice, that's two callbacks. We have to stay under 30% and managers always push for less and less.\nThe line is 7 days down to the minute. You wanna mess with someone who mistreated you? Call back. And again. And again. \n\nCredits. Front line agents have an average credit per call of 25 cents or less.  Sups were around $10. So you want a credit of $10 off for 12 months? That agent (or sup) just took a $120 credit hit on that call. Keep in kind most people, regardless of position, take roughly 60 calls in 8 hours\n\nWhen you ask for a sup, it's not a sup. It's a slightly better trained agent with a higher credit limit and usually more patience. That's it. Oh, you want that sups manager? Well fine. It's actually one of the 'assistance queue' agents just like the sup you talked to. No joke. You hit a wall, and go no higher.\n\nYou have 14 days from the date of install to swap one (1) piece of equipment. Unless you are speaking with a 'sup' then it's 30. There is no override for this. And if you want to cancel, you have 24 hours. Despite what sales may tell you, it's 24 hours. Not 15 days, not 30, 24 hours. And just because the state of Florida has lemon laws does NOT mean they apply. Directv does business from Colorado. The laws apply from that state. Only. \n\nAs far as canceling, there's rules. Fun ones. One of the easiest ways is if you are within the first 30 days, it's a known issue (internally called a CADIES), you've called 5 times and had a minimum of one service call. We can waive the cancelation fees. Or if you move to a nursing home that doesn't allow directv. There's others, I don't recall them. \n\nWhen you introduce yourself by either:\nA) interrupting my greeting (which is specifically worded and required by quality assurance), or\nB) telling me how long you've been a customer, \nI lose respect. I will, at that point, be doing the minimum to get off the call. And 99% of my peers agree. We take angry calls for 8 hours a day for pay that isn't worth it. So cool it.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau. Oh my favorite three words. At the time of this writing, DTV had 'no rating' with the BBB. But it used to have a D. There's a long list of complaints. The problem is, people assume the BBB is an agency that can do something. They hold information. Nothing more. They don't control businesses, they don't help you in court... It's a reference. Kind of like Google maps has a review feature. So please, report us. Doesn't matter. \n\nFinally, service call dates. Omg. I do not care that you have a house full of people to watch a movie, and have been with us since 1967, and find this situation 'unacceptable' (internally, we used to joke about the top three things we heard, regardless of call content. The first, the customer would almost always repeat how long they've been with us. The second, that they've never been late on a payment. The third, that they \"find this situation unacceptable\"). There is not a damn thing I can do to move that date up from tomorrow or even 4 days from now. Hell, if it's over 7 days (over, mind you. Not exactly 7), I can escalate to our field office and wait list you. And due to recent idiocracy from some higher ups (may go into that in another post), we can't even call you back when we promise to 'monitor' the account. Nope. If we are in a queue, we were forbidden from doing so. We were told we have to ready in (ready to take a call) for 30 seconds and if we're lucky enough to not get one, we can call you. And when we aren't In a queue, it's most likely after 9 pm, and we can't call you back. Sorry. However, the only (ONLY!) position thing the ATT merger brought was that if you have a can be reached number on the account, we can call you whenever. Again, only if we aren't queued to the hilt. \n\nOne last thing: we have a set greeting. We do not choose it. We are REQUIRED to say certain things. And honestly, I do not care that you hate ATT, I am still required to say 'My name is throaway256k and I'm a supervisor with AT&amp;T'. You can demand I never say those letters again. I will have to. At the end of the call: 'Once again, my name is throwaway256k and thank you for choosing AT&amp;T'.  I'm sorry. I truly am. If I don't, I get bad quality assurance scores.\n\nI'm happy to answer questions. Or comments. I don't care about the karma, so vote as you please. I'm just a bit angry that my 4 years with this company was thrown away because I had the audacity to try to save my own life (and accidently chose the wrong aux because of the fact the tornado siren that is 500 feet away from my house was going off).",

There were a few moments today alone where I thought some agents were about to cry, which I've never seen here before. I can see some people rapidly burning out and I'm worried they will quit, which we absolutely can't afford right now.\n\nWe need to improve morale and maintain organization, but I'm at a loss. Lately I've been working after hours at home to complete their work for them, just so customers don't get pissed. Obviously that's not a good solution but it's a stopgap measure.\n\nWhat would you suggest for helping people to feel less stressed and improve their work environment?",

        "text": "Okay. First post here, please forgive any trespasses against grammar and all that. Started in a call center a year ago and practically had a full on panic attack the morning we got on the phones after training. I am talking visualizing a dinosaur ripping the roof off and carrying me away. I told myself, \"man up, and get on that phone\" .\n     So here we are, 4 seasons later, and whilst the anxiety has decreased by perhaps a fraction of a miniscule, I feel like absolute rubbish. Every.day. The customers go absolutely mad about this and that, \"If you do not fix this issue immediately, I will chop my limps with a machete and smash this bloody TV set with a hammmmmer\" and how does one respond to that exactly? \"Oh please, ma'am, please do not hack your limbs with a machete??? I will crawl through this phone line if I must\"....oh yes. That happened.\n    Being told that I am an idiot and simply tell customers things they already know is quite the repeat, \"Oh and if so, why are you ringing me if you are already aware??\" \"I, ma'am am simply informing you of why your bill is X pounds, due to the fact there was no payment received in 6 months. You rang us.\" Nonsense.\n      Let us not forget call reviews. \"If you had done this, this customer would have been thrilled!!!!!! Happy Christmas\" Oh yes, we know for absolute certain had I told customer \"XYand Z\" they would have become so elated they would have transformed into a chocolate chip cookie, sprouted legs, and skipped off to happyville. Never to phone again!!!!!\" Yes, absolutely. We have no clue who this person is, yet had I done \"XY and Z\", they would have every predicament they shall ever face instantly solved. Let's not however forget, that had I done \"XY and Z\", I did not do \"AB and C\". So one is never enough. All whilst ensuring that the call duration is no longer than 9 minutes, and utilizing Star Wars force to ensure they absolutely never once phone back in again. Shall they ring back in, the sky will break open and rain upon us blood-sucking trantulas!!!!\n  Alas, a customer told me he wanted to see my.....and stick.....things...that's it. Due to quality, I sat there listening to the perversion trying to envision anything but what I was hearing, including a band of singing hippy carrots. I was desperate.",

Took an escalated call the other day from an irate woman demanding that her warranty replacement device be delivered that day (it was already late afternoon on a Friday). Obviously not possible, so I offered to overnight it to her when we re-opened on Monday so it would arrive Tuesday morning. This wasn't good enough. She then started demanding a refund, which was impossible for multiple reasons in this case.\n\nI should pause here to give you a better idea of this interaction. I've been in customer service for a while and have developed a pretty thick skin after having dealt with all sorts of customer issues. Sometimes I get irritated, but I swallow my pride and try to find the best solution, something I'm sure you can all relate to. We've all had our share of angry, rude, harassing customers. Let me tell ya, never in my life have I encountered someone so vitriolic and entitled. The things she said weren't just rude, they were borderline abusive. I was shocked that this amount of raw hate over something so trivial could come from one person. Also fun fact, she runs a daycare and kept yelling at the kids in the background to shut the hell up. A real class act, this broad.\n\nSo I tell her that I know this is frustrating and I'm so sorry for any inconvenience, etc., even though we as a company did absolutely nothing wrong. She replies, \"No you're not; I don't believe that for a second! You're just saying that because I'm angry!\"\n\nI mean...yeah.\n\nSo then she keeps screaming (and I do mean *screaming*) that she's going to contact the Attorney General and sue us, blah blah blah. \"I'm gonna rip you apart with the Better Business Bureau!! What is the name of your company's BBB rep???\"\n\n\"Ma'am, that would be me.\" ...long pause...\n\n\"If that package is not in my hands on Tuesday morning, you're going to have a huge problem on your hands. Do you understand me?? DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME??!!\"\n\nAnd she hung up.",

Long-time reader, first time poster and all that jazz.\nSo, I work as tech services in a call centre for a large brewer, I take the calls from customers to try and fix the issue over the phone but I also plan work as well. Planning is me calling customers to get a date sorted for one of my engineers to arrive and get a new brand installed in their pub, club hotel whatever it may be. Now, one of my guys recently called in sick which meant I had to replan a lot of work; the conversation went as follows, \nMe- Me, C-c Customer\n\nMe: Good afternoon my name is Bubo_bubo, I’m calling from bigbrewery$$ with regards to your installation works for BIGbrand$. I’m really sorry, but unfortunately my engineer has taken ill and is unable to attend so I need to reschedule the works. \n\nC: Well, that’s not good enough. I need BIGbrand in here now.\n\n**Me:**  I know, I’m very sorry it’s just that he’s called in today and our engineers do not carry all of the necessary equipment for installations without prior notice as there simply isn’t enough room on their vans. I’m really sorry; I really do know it’s a huge inconvenience to you and your customers. *(It is, they sell through whatever brand we’re replacing, so if they wanted our brand in place of fosters, they sell all through their fosters and are left with no beer until we arrive. So I get it’s a pain in the ass.) *\n\n**C:** Well it’s not good enough, I want them here now.\n\nMe:** I can by all means get someone to you, but as I’ve said they simply will not have the equipment needed to carry out the works for you. I really do apologise I know it leaves you in a bad situation but I just cannot get the equipment needed to you today. \n\n**C:** Well, you need to give us more notice when someone’s ill. This isn’t enough notice, it’s not good enough.  If no one is here today cancel the job.\n\n*Now, my engineer called in at 8 am to say he was sick I called the customer when I started at 9 am. I have no chill for idiocy, my manager knows it lord knows why they still let me deal with the customers on a daily basis. I cannot tolerate a fool, customer, my co-workers both in the office and our sales reps. I just can’t. And if someone wants their job cancelling I am happy to oblige, its less work for me to do at the end of the day. *\n\n**Me:** As useful as it would be, I cannot predict when a person will be sick, my engineers are only human, and so they do unfortunately get sick. I will cancel the job now for you, thank you for your time. \n\n**C:** *After a moment of silence when he realises threatening to cancel a job won’t get anyone there sooner. It’s worth noting we have the number one selling brand of beer in our country, so it’s a bad one not to have in your pub in terms of customers wanting it* Fine, when  can you get here, but I’m not happy., you need to know when they’re going to be sick\n\nAt this point I just went through to process of rebooking him in for a few days time whilst wondering what to do with the super power I apparently should have.\n\n\n**Tl;Dr** – I should know when people are going to be calling in sick before they do call in. Even if they were fine the day before it seems. ",

This means we get a lot of weird calls that normally don't fit our typical sales consultant role... But we still have the same metrics as before. As such, a lot of my job is trying to have conversations with people who don't want to have conversations. \n\nCase in point: I recently had a lady call up (through the retail line) with questions regarding our products. Great, I tell her, that's exactly what I do. No, she says, she wants to talk with a real person (not a call center flunky, as the implication goes). \"That's ok ma'am, I'm a real person too\". She laughs it off, saying that the only reason she waited 15 minutes to talk with me was to ask if she could stop into our retail store and ask someone else a question. I laugh with her, bitterly, secretly hoping that she waits even longer at our famously busy stores. Our call ends in 2 minutes, putting another ding into my metrics. \n\n",

I no longer work there, though, thank god.\n\nAnyway. The story. When I received this call, I had only been working there for maybe two months. A woman with a southern accent calls in. Because I was new at the time, my calls took a lot longer to complete (we did not have to meet any standards when it came to call length). She wants to report a claim for her family of nine people, and between them there are 4-5 households. Each claim must be set up per household. So I gather everything I need from her and ask her if she can bear with me while I get all the claims set up.

We exchange greetings.\n\nMe: So, did you get the snake?\n\nLady: No, my brother shot at it with a gun, but he missed and it got away.\n\nMe: *curling lips inward and trying not to laugh* Oh, well, at least it's out of the house now.\n\nAnd we continue the claims process.\n\nYeah, definitely one of the strangest calls I ever took.

        "text": "I have been working at this call centre for almost 4 months now. It has been stressful since day one, but it has never been quite as bad as it is now. Where I work, I have already worked in 3 different departments as they like to train you in a new thing after a few weeks of you taking calls in what you're trained in. Because of this, I've never gotten good at any of the departments because I'm constantly learning new processes and procedures and new content. To top it all off, the management sucks- the people who do the rosters are constantly messing them up, I spent 6 weeks chasing up overtime pay which I didn't even ask to do the overtime they made me do it by rostering me to do it, the people marking calls are extremely harsh, at least 70% of the trainers have never even taken a call in what they're training people to do, and my supervisor is an ass hat. \n\nThe past week or so I have just entered yet again a new department, taking calls that are completely new to me. One of my calls got marked in May (2 days into new department) and they gave me a fail for it. My supervisor took me into a room and made me listen to the call with a note pad and write down everything I did wrong. The reason was honestly quite pathetic, and given I was so new to taking these calls, it was rather reasonable that I failed. Then this month I thought things would get better because I've really been trying my best since then. Then yesterday I got another fail. For something even more petty and ridiculous on my call that affected the customer is no way at all. It was simply that I read scripting a little bit differently. Turns out that a bunch of people from my team have been marked already this month and 100% of them failed! Because my supervisor is so horrible, he thinks it's all our fault. But he's offering no help at all to any of us and instead if anyone else fails this month they're getting a formal, written warning for it which will \"effect our employment here and any chance to advance within the company\". We also have our break times monitored and our call times. We get an hours worth of unpaid breaks a day and if we go to the toilet or go get a drink while we're not on a break it's timed and then if we go over a few minutes a week doing that we get told off by my supervisor.\n\nThe job is bad enough as it is. I get abused multiple times a day, and in fact yesterday after I got that failed call I had a woman abuse me for 30 minutes. Apparently me asking her questions to confirm her identity was me \"starting with her\" and \"giving her attitude\" and she was calling about a refund she apparently didn't recieve and she had 'forgotten' her bank account details so I couldn't even confirm them. Ugh.\n\nI got home last night and burst into tears. I don't know if I can do this anymore!\n\nI think I'm a pretty good agent given that I'm constantly changing departments, constantly learning new content, have the worst supervisor in the building to deal with and I'm a fairly awkward person socially as it is. This job has definitely made me more confident on the phone and more confident speaking with customers. I dont like to be abused obviously but I can handle it. It's the management that are making me want to leave.\n\nThe hardest part is I could quit if I wanted to. I live with my mom who said she'd support me till I find something else if I need her to. I'm in my early 20's and have no debts to pay off, I don't even have a car and I have a lot of money in savings.. but if I can, I want to find something else before I leave. But I don't know if I can do this until I find something else. For the past year I've been unemployed on/off for the entire time. Ive done 2 volunteer positions and had another job as a gardener (which was even worse than the call center, physically though not mentally). I've been applying to jobs for the past few weeks and I'm scared I'll never find another job if I leave. I'm scared they're going to fire me because I keep failing my calls.. and then if I fail again, I'll get a formal warning from my supervisor. It's just too much! \n\nI need a supportive supervisor but he doesn't care about staff at all. We're just a number. We don't even have our own desks, they rotate as do our rosters. I've been on the later shift lately and I've had to search high and low to even find a seat and then I've had to wait 30 mins for the computer to load up so I've had to get there half an hour before my shift. Their turnover rate is pretty high at least 50% of the people I started with have already quit and I haven't met many people who have stayed at this place more than a year. If they have they have been promoted off the phones. I commute 3 hours a day in total there and back, so it's a 12 hour day instead of an 8 hour one. At this point, my life is basically get up, exercise, go to work, come home, have dinner, go to bed, repeat. On my days off I'm too tired / exhausted to do pretty much anything. I often just lay in my bed all day and watch movies.\n\nAt this point, I'll be happy to take any other job. Part time, casual.. Mcdonalds or a pizza place are even looking pretty good right now... anything just to tide me over until I find something else. I am unsure what I should do. Half of me wants to keep coming in until I find something else and the other half of me wants to put my resignation in first thing Monday. My friend was lucky enough to just find something else as she signed up with a recruiter a few months ago who has been helping her. I'm going to do the same and hope for the best. With the way things are going, Im going to need to start seeing a therapist to stick this job out if I stay here long enough.",

At the end of this tale after the TL;DR I will put the links for them if you want to read them!\n\nPrior to working in my current role, I use to loath and despise call centers - however after working in my current role I have grown a huge respect for all call centre workers and now when I need to call then for pesonal reasons I alway's go prepared with account numbers, security questions etc... so alway's make the transitions easy!\n\nPet Hates I have in call center:\n\nAccount Questions\n\nCustomer calls up....\n\n&gt; [g33kman500](https://www.reddit.com/user/g33kman500/submitted/): Hi you are through to $isp_desk my name is **me** how can I help?\n\n&gt; generic_user: Hi, my e-mail address / online account / webhosting is not working, I am LOOSING BILLIONS OF POUNDS every second!!!!!

WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY MY BILLS!!!\n\n&gt; [g33kman500](https://www.reddit.com/user/g33kman500/submitted/): We offer you a service, which you requested we provide to you (phone, broadband or what ever else you purchased) and in doing so payment is required for them.\n\n&gt; generic_user: WELL I AM NOT GOING TO PAY! SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO!\n\n&gt; [g33kman500](https://www.reddit.com/user/g33kman500/submitted/): If your services are that important for you, you need to pay for them, as mentioned you are loosing money because of this. We will cease the account if payment is not received, put it this way $user - I see that your $company does $product if I was to come and purchase something from you, I would assume you would like payment for it.

Then, attempting to get to the purpose of the call, began, \"So, Ms.- *Doctor-*\"\n\nThe catch apparently came too late for the good Doctor, who screamed audibly into the phone for a good five seconds before hanging up. \n\nWith the only license to my name being one to practice insurance, I spent the rest of the day jokingly insisting all my coworkers refer to me as *Agent* FlyingGuineaPig.

I understand that this countries economy is fucked beyond all belief and that people have issues making ends meet.

Can't pay your rent, but want to take a loan application? Don't waste my time on something that will be declined. You had a death in the family? Stop talking and get off the phone, and so forth.\n\nI guess it comes from a company paying you at a low rate, making your job crappier everyday, and then expecting you to care about other people's problems when you have a multitude of your own they don't care about.

She then explains again how the other two 'weren't her fault\" because she \"forgot\" so blah blah.  I again tell her that forgetting or whatever still doesn't change the facts.

He then went to say that the world is a small place, and he might \"see\" me in it.  \n\nUsually shit like this would piss me off, but I was so surprised I giggled and disconnected the call. \n\nI need a new job ASAP.\n\nTL;DR wasn't able to do what customer wanted me to do and he threatened to \"see\" me in this small world.

        "text": "Today I had a call that lasted over 30 minutes.  I say this because our metric is to have a call average under 3 minutes.  So this guy tanked that metric for me today.  Why?  Because he accused us of stealing his money. I've worked in lots of call centers for many years and I currently work in a bank call center.  Today this guy called in and after I greeted him the first words out of his mouth were \"You people stole my money!\"  No greeting, no name, nothing.  He then goes on a tirade about how he wants his money back or \"you people\" will pay, etc.  Five minutes in he takes a breath and I'm finally able to get him to identify himself so I can look at where this supposed theft happened.  In his diatribe he kept mentioning a loan he took out.  In his profile I see no loan, neither past nor present, no previous applications neither denied or approved, and no pending applications.  I tell him this and he tells me what day he applied and how much he was approved for and that we're now asking for payment but he never got his money.  So I look again and realize that on the date in question he opened a credit card, not a loan.  The rest of the call was spent with me explaining the difference between the two and how when you get approved for a credit card you do NOT get a lump sum deposited into your checking account. The call ended with him calling me a damn liar and hanging up.  Some people.",

I work for a large cable company and was receiving all tech support calls and have been working here for a year now. One call in particular had me in tears at the end because of the way this idiot decided to treat me due to some tiling/pixelation on the TNT channel where the NBA game was taking place. Mind you, he was calling about 20 minutes before the game started and began the call by immediately asking \"can I please have your operator number?\" Great. I already knew this was a \"good\" start to the call. So we casually go through the troubleshooting process and he's calm and oddly polite, although he kept stressing how important this basketball game is for him \"it's the most important game in nba history... Blah blah blah.. I need this to work\" okay, so we rebooted his box. After the reboot was done, he still has pixelation issues and at this point there was only 10 minutes left until the game began and he started to personally attack and blame me for this happening when all I've done was try to help get this to work. He began to insult my intelligence AFTER I offered him what he considered an insufficient amount of credit for this inconvenience and called me some very rude names and requested to speak to a supervisor. I didn't hesitate to get him over to one. I was sobbing at the end of this call and even while I was escalating the call because I have finally had enough. I know I shouldn't take these people seriously and usually I don't, but I think I just finally hit my breaking point and am beginning to look for a new job. I don't think any of this bs is worth my sanity, no matter how much they're paying me to be there.",

I just happened to stumble here and can bring over my tales I've been sharing to facebook for the last 2 years!\n\nI work in a medicare call center, so the majority of the customer base I speak to is elderly, with the occasional family and providers sprinkled in. This story is from last summer and remains one of my favorites.\n\nThis was about a month after I began working from home and I had a friend staying with me for a week at the time. She would play video games while I worked so at least when I was waiting on a call I'd have some entertainment.\n\nSo my phone rings and I do my usual spiel. Can't hear the caller at all. He has me on speaker phone and is in another room. Finally he comes back to the phone and goes off on a rant about how small his social security check is and how everything else goes up but that doesn't which allowed him to segue into Obamacare which he said \"they need to repeal\". \n\nAt this point I was thoroughly confused because Medicare is not the same thing as the Affordable Care Act. I said \"..... who needs to repeal Obamacare?\" \n\n**Caller:** The black lady and the movie star! They need to repeal Obamacare\n\n**Me:** w-who?\n\n**Caller:** Oh I don't know! I'll remember their names in a moment!\n\n**Me:** Sir, I have no idea what you're talking about. Medicare is not the same thing as Obamacare.\n\n**Caller:** You don't know what I'm talking about? *(as he's scoffing)* Tell me, what type of education do you have?\n\n**Me:** My education has nothing to do with this. There's no reason to insult me.\n\n**Caller:** I'm not insulting you, it's a question.\n\n**Me:** *(while sighing)* I am college educated.\n\n**Caller:** I bet have more education in my finger than you have in your entire body!\n\nThis continued on for awhile before finally he realized I couldn't help him with his jihad against the affordable care act and he told me he was hanging up on me. It's a shame though that in his more advanced education than what I have, he never learned how to properly hang up a phone.\n\n*edit:* forgot to include the bit where I asked him who the hell the black lady and the movie star are. included it now where it belonged in the discussion. sorry bout that all.",

Pretty easy mistake to make; she probably just checked the wrong box. The difference in the premium was a whopping $2 for a *higher* coverage than she'd intended to purchase, so really; the complete opposite of a big deal. I relay this information to the customer, because I'm helpful.\n\nThe customer gasps loudly to show me how appalled she is. \"*Why* are you saying things that are *untrue?!?!* That absolutely *did not* happen; there was no *application!* Why are you saying these *things!?!?!*\"\n\nOkay...so I should've steered around the crazy. Oops. She'd been perfectly happy believing that we were just a bunch of crooks and scam artists. Never mind how it happened; I'll just put the coverage back where you want it.\n\n\"*Why* are you being so *dismissive* now!?! That's just...it's like you don't care at *all!* And the things that you're *saying...*\"\n\nWell...okay...sorry if reality is confusing. We don't need to talk about that anymore.

I can enroll you over the phone using the large credit balance you have on the account so you don't have to pay anything at all right now.\n\n&gt; Guy: I'm still going to be charged the fee, right?\n\n&gt; Me: Yes...but you have a cre-\n\n&gt; Guy: Then ok. I'll mail my payment in.\n\n&gt; Me: You don't want to use your credit balance?\n\n&gt; Guy: Why use the credit balance when I can send in my payment and pay the exact amount needed?\n\nAt this point, I just gave up. I gave him our address and ended the call.\n\nIt brings me back to a saying that one of my old supervisors said to me.\n\n**\"You can explain it to them, but you can't understand it for them.\"**",

I used to work in a tech support call center back when DSL was just taking off and 3mbps considered \"fast\"... \n\nMy question is, what is the proper etiquette when it comes to asking to speak to someone with an american accent ?\n\nNow before you guys go off and jump on me for racism, etc, it has nothing to do with that, the truth of the matter is I have severe hearing loss and understanding someone with an accent I'm simply not used to, unless I've spoken to them at length for a long time (over months and months) is near impossible.\n\nI've tried explaining to the agent that it was simply a language barrier issue and the issue was me, not them (sounds like a bad breakup line) but more often than not it still seems to offend the person I'm speaking with. Which I feel horrible about as I know exactly what they're job entails and the crap they have to put up with on a daily basis.\n\nThoughts ?\n\n\nThanks!",

Just discovered this subreddit, so obligatory FTP, and I have a few stories to tell.\n\n\nSidenote: It's been a few years since I stopped working in call centers, and while I do consider my time with them to be a growing experience, it was most definitely the WORST jobs I've ever held. So much so that I swore never to work at one again, regardless of circumstance. Anyway, onto the tale!\n\n\nPreface: I worked in the customer service area for a phone service provider that offered one of the cheapest rates on the market and no background or credit checks. As you can imagine, a percentage of our client base was less than savory, to say the least. When you logged a call, the system alerted you to 2 different assistance groups (General or Financial), so you had an idea on what to expect. Note that financial assistant usually meant people calling in to get an extension on their payment date.\n\n\nDL= Dollar Lady, ME= me\n\n\nME: \"Thank you for calling 'COMPANY'! How can I help you today?\"\n\n\nDL: \"Yeah hi, I wanted to get an extension on my payment date please.\"\n\n\nTo get an extension you could log into the website or through your phone and pay $1 minimum though we always asked for 50% first and worked down, or setup an echeck to be cashed at midnight, or pay directly at one of our many locations.\n\n\nME: \"Sure thing! (Got her account info. and read spiel on conditions) Would you be able to pay $$?\"\n\n\nDL: \"I don't have that much.\"\n\n\nME: \"Alright, how about less $$?\"\n\n\nDL: \"No, that's too much.\"\n\n\nME: (starting to get annoyed) \"Ok, would you like to setup an echeck for later then? I'd just need some bank information.\"\n\n\nDL: \"I don't have a savings or checking account.\"\n\n\nME: (visibly getting annoyed) \"Ok, then you can go to one of our locations and pay at least $1 there.\" \n\n\nDL: \"It's too far away and I don't have a car.\"\n\n\nME: (facedesking) \"In that case I'm sorry miss, but we need at least a $1 payment or the system rejects the extension and you get a fine on your account.\"\n\n\nDL: \"Oh, but I have dollar! Can I take a picture of it and send it to your corporate email and get my extension?\"\n\n\nME: ...(WUTFACE)\n\n\nDL: \"Hello? Are you there?\"\n\n\nME: \"...yes, I'm sorry we're having some phone issues right now (TRYING HARD NOT TO LAUGH). No, it doesn't work like that. Unfortunately those are the options available, I can't offer any alternative methods. May I help you with anything else?\"\n\n\nDL: \"No thank you, I'll see what I can do.\" -click-\n\n\nI was struggling so hard not to laugh I didn't notice my supervisor standing behind me. He immediately marks me as logged-off, takes me to his station and bursts into laughter. Turns out he'd been ghosting my call and was amazed how I kept my composure. Even gave me a Milky Way for my 'Stellar' performance.\n\n\nI immediately logged off to take a break and get a smoke. By the way, I DON'T SMOKE!",

I've figured out that this whole hospital situation is going to be a recurring thing so I need to make sure someone else has access to make payments when this happens again. I get that it's totally my fault. My bills don't stop just because I'm in hospital it just didn't really enter my mind. \n\n\nAlthough in saying that I'm actually transferring my balance to another credit card with less interest and that will set up direct debits fortnightly for whatever amount I choose.

I logged the phone call as normal and wrote a lengthy description of what had happened and why I had to get firm with the customer.

So terrible *sniffs and huffs*    \nM: What can I help you with today?    \n\nC: I just spoke to a colleague of yours *sniff sniff* and *whimper* he just called me a whore and a bitch. He told me to shut the fuck up and treated me terribly. He said he'd make sure *cough, splutter, whimper* that I never got my internet back and that whores like me should stop going on whore vacations.    \n\nM: (at this point I was struggling not to laugh) Oh dear, that's awful (she didn't realise it was the same person) I'll get management on that straight away! Is there anything else I can help you with?    \n\nC: Can you turn my internet back on?    \n\nM: No...    \n\nC: You fucking fuck! *no hint of crying or sniffing or sadness*    \n*CLICK*\n\nI did actually have to send that one to management.

She is **super** paranoid. I, for obvious reasons, cannot do this. If she has an issue with her card, we need it there to be able to verify and help. Said woman doesn't like this and wants it removed.  What should have been a 5 minute call turns into a 20 minute call because she won't shut up about having a \"clean\" account. I finally remove her street address and put her in a no mail category. Cue another 10 minutes of \"clean\" account tin foil hattery.\n\n* Woman calls in because she was not able to leave a store with a basket full of unpaid groceries while her sister rang up and paid for another basket. The cashier had the audacity to stop her from leaving the store. Customer talked to store management and got the \"We'll talk to the cashier\" line. Wasn't happy about it and decided to complain to me. When store line is repeated and that the store's management and district management will be told of her unhappiness, said customer was not happy with my service either.\n\n* Store calls in to add rewards to customer's account. Want's 8k reward points added. I don't ask, they don't offer.\n\n* Nationwide outage on store loyalty system. Slight uptick in calls due to issue, mostly from people who are understanding but happy to get things fixed. The asshat I got thought we were trying to cheat him out of 10¢ and wanted an explanation as to why we were trying to cheat him.\n\n* \"I didn't know I had to have the coupon to get the discount.\" ***VERBATIM***.\n\n* Last call of the night is a gentlemen who does not want to have me fix his issue, he wants me to talk to him. His issue is fixed in 3 minutes but he's got me on the phone for another 10 telling me what he had for breakfast on Sunday morning, 15 years ago.\n\n* Remember basket lady? The one who tried to walk out without paying and was pissed off she couldn't? Asked for her information at the beginning of the call. Refused to give it. Told her that because it was a store issue call that I didn't need it. Fill out her case and ask her if there was anything else she wanted to add. Said \"Don't you want my information?\" Told her that she didn't have to give it to me if she felt uncomfortable doing so. Told me that I wasn't interested in helping her and hung up.\n\nThere were more, but they tend to blend together. Happy Monday.",

        "text": "You'd think that ten years would be a long time, but it frequently just feels like a blip.  I mean, I work four days a week on third shift.  I write my book, play video-games, talk to friends, and collect my paycheck.  The job is just a job.  I do it because it doesn't take away from the rest of my life.\n\nStill, I've picked up a few useful tidbits in ten years and they do kinda apply to life in general.  I thought I'd share some.  \n\n1.If someone asks for a manager at the beginning of a call, they're an idiot.  This is 100% of the time the case.  If someone appeals to authority before finding out if there's anything the person in front of them can do for them, they're not looking to be helped, they're looking to be catered to.  \n\n2.The seven best words a person can say to a support representative at the start of a call are 'What information do you need from me?' \n\nStarting a call with a long, winding explanation is the worst thing you can do.  Yes, we might say 'How can I help you?'...about two thirds of the time we don't mean that.  What we mean is 'Please summarize so I know you're talking to the right person'. \n\nAlso, if we ask you to verify your information, try to keep yourself to about three syllables per second.  Nobody likes repeating themselves because you were in a hurry and it actually uses more time than speaking at a reasonable speed.\n\n3.Learned Helplessness Is A Thing - There are entire sections of the populace who are completely helpless.  They do not help themselves in any way, shape, or form.  They go and seek out authority figures to help them, even if the authority is some poor shmuck at the end of a telephone line.\n\n4.I cannot diagnose your problem by having you hold your phone up to whatever is making the buzzing/crackling/snapping/gushing noise.  EVER.  \n\n5.Nobody is more dangerous, unpleasant, or difficult than rich house-wives and doctors.  If you could hear how doctors treat the people who work for them over the telephone, you'd be terrified to go to the hospital.  \n\nI've worked for hundreds of doctors in my ten year span.  About two thirds of them are maniacs, emotional cripples, drug addicts, or sociopaths.  Or several of of those things simultaneously.\n\nRich housewives mix an all-powerful entitlement complex with extreme boredom and almost unlimited time to exercise both.\n\n6.Treat customers like mushrooms - Feed Them Shit, Keep Them In The Dark.  Revealing the internal mechanisms by which your company operates makes people think they have a handle on things.  This makes them think they have power.  Power in the hands of a customer sounds great on a marketing campaign, but in the real world it's actually a *massive* impediment to getting things accomplished.  \n\nWe WANT to help people for the most part.  If nothing else, it gets them off the phone. \n\n7.Almost everyone who works in a call center comes in one of three flavors: \n\nThe squishy, who cry and take things personally.  \n\nThe duck, who treats everything like water off their back.  \n\nThe monster, who enjoys it when people yell at them.  \n\nI am, freely admitted, a monster.  Nothing makes me happier than someone who shouts, because I never have to feel bad for anything I do to them after that.  \n\nYou *do not want a squishy person* taking your call. Squishy people will spray you with useless information that won't actually solve your problem.  They're just trying to avoid making you mad, not fix the issues you need fixed.  They are the *least* competent people in any call center.\n\nA duck doesn't care about your call.  They're just trying to get you off the phone.  \n\nThe monster is who you want to take your call.  If you're nice, you will find an almost endless supply of help, discounts, and quick calls from technicians.  Nice people get precisely the opposite reaction from the monster that assholes do.  It shuts off our latent sadistic tendencies when somebody is nice.  \n\n8.Just because a company says they have '24 Hour Customer Support' doesn't make it true.  It looks amazing to put that on your website or product manual, but tech support people go home at 5:00 PM everywhere besides the medical industry.  Yes, there might be after hours maintenance available, but it will be slow and someone will have to get their pants on.\n\n9.Nothing is ever gained by handing the phone to your spouse.  \n\nMarried couples who let the wife make the phone call, then tell me what the problem is and then pass the phone to the husband when I attempt to explain the problem will *never* stop being infuriating because I am required to explain simple shit twice.  \n\nNobody likes explaining simple shit twice.  Simple shit is simple so you can explain it once.  \n\n10.Anyone and everyone who offers you a deal on something that is 'going to happen soon' is lying to you.  EVERYONE.  Iraqi Dinar pushers, car salesmen, preachers, fake abortion clinics, presidential candidates, investment counselors, realty consultants, relationship counselors...\n\nIf they offer you a deal and whatever is meant to happen hasn't happened yet, you are being shitted on.  \n\nPre-ordering anything is opening wide and puckering up.",

        "text": "So this is my first time posting here, have worked as a CSR for a TV provider for a little over a year now.  For the past month I have been repeatedly told that one of my metrics is incredibly low and that it is really making me look badly to management.  The metric in question is basically how often/well we follow a flow to solve a technical issue.  Honestly i thought it was 100% my fault, because of how long i have worked there (1 year may not seem like a lot, but only 1 other agent on a team of 12-14 agents has been there longer than me), I honestly don't bother to use the flows sometimes.  It's a useless metric in my opinion.  It is intended to help lower call time and prevent repeat calls by solving problems, and I understand that, but my stats for those areas are always excellent, far far above average.  Yet for the past month i have been hounded to start using these flows correctly.  Found out today that a certain tool we had that tracked how many people were in the queues would bring the metric down a ton if you had it open.  And i would basically have it open all day, as i like to keep track of how many people are waiting.  \n  \nJust annoys me to be hounded for a useless and broken metric for over a month.",

        "text": "I (SIWY) work for a large ISP and TV company that we will call **company**. \n\nA quite high profile football star (soccer, to the Americans here) calls in. I won't and can't say who he is (obviously), but he's an above average player who plays for a mid English Premier League team. (No guess games please - cos security and I know him by name. \n\nSo his call comes through, and he's wanting to cancel the account because he is moving abroad (I will let you infer from that what you will). And right away I spot the name, and the little tag under his name stated as 'VIP' and put two and two together.\n\nI say my greeting and go through security with him and he's happy...\n\nNow we have a specific department that deals with VIP accounts. They are highly paid and trained in all aspects (tech support, billing, cancels - you name it). And **no matter what the call is**, when a VIP label comes through, you have to transfer it as soon as they are verified. NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nSo I try to explain this to the footballer who shall be called **footballer**\n\nSIWY: Okay, thanks for doing that for me Mr.Footballer, I would be happy to help you with your query, but I can see that you're registered as a VIP on our system and we have a specific department who deal with VIP queries, and unfortunately I do have to transfer you across to them as per our company guidelines\"\n\nFootballer: *audible sigh* \"Come on mate, look I know you're just doing your job an all that but I just want to cancel. Can't you just do it for me?\"\n\nSIWY: \"I appreciate that, but we do have very specific guidelines to follow here, and for several confidentiality and security reasons I am not allowed to even have access to your account (they are locked to non VIP agents, all you can see are their name and address). But our VIP team are highly capable and can help you with your query.\"\n\nFootballer: \"I don't really care about your procedure mate. I know I'm coming across as a cunt mate, but I'm kinda in a hurry, I don't fancy another 20 minute wait on hold for them\"\n\nSIWY: \"The VIP department doesn't deal with a great amount of volume, they have a wait time of under 1 minute right now. And I really cannot help you. Our guidelines prohibit it and I my system won't allow me too anyway. I am sorry. Can I transfer you now?\"\n\nFootballer: \"I will give you 2 grand in your pocket for you to do it for me right now\" (Quite how he expects to be able to give me £2000 in my pocket over the phone when I am many miles away, I don't know)\n\nSIWY: \"Thank you for the offer, but I am not allowed to take personal tips or money. Additionally, it would do no good. No amount of money will unlock your account for me. May I transfer you now?\"\n\nFootballer: \"Fine mate, whatever... You just talked yourself out of two months wages\".\n\nSo I transfer him and hear no more about it...\n\nNow I want to be clear; he isn't the first celeb I have had, and he wasn't being rude or that much of a dick (a bit, but not much), and aside from his requests, seemed quite friendly.

Then, as everyone else files home, the usual 1-3 hours of back-to-back calls for nightshift turns into 5 or 6 hours of back to back calls.\n\n\nI keep telling myself it's a stupid thing to be angry about. I have no control over this and thus need to find a way to not be so upset about it. Still, after the 5th hour of back-to-back, I am seething with resentment.\n\n\nI just needed to get that out. I'm sure I'll still be royally pissed off by 9 PM tonight. But with luck, it'll be slightly less pissed off. ",
