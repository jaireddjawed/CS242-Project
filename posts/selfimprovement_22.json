        "text": "Hey guys. I currently wish to take up fitness to improve both my physical and mental health. I have a choice between doing workouts at home during the morning and evening before and after my uni. alternatively, I have access to the gym at my uni, and could push in at least one workout daily. The problem is that during the morning and the evening I tend to be tired and forget or neglect to do the workouts. When at school, I feel intimidated going to the gym because I feel as if I have no clue what I'm doing, and its usually really packed in there. \n\nwhich one do i choose?",

        "text": "I'm an oblivious guy, I trust easily when it comes to new people, and I fall for disingenuous behavior from friends and family. Guess you could say I'm too shy and forgiving. Things get even more complicated when it comes to the opposite sex, dating, and just trying to attract someone. \n\nI've always had this awareness in the back of my mind that things between people are much deeper and more involved. Like the game is way more complicated than I ever expected it to be, and I just ignored it. Everyone seems to be hyperaware (some are paranoid) to what people say or do, and that in itself has gotten me in trouble due to misunderstandings of things I've said. \n\nA lot of people I believe think I'm this oblivious idiot, but the reality is I think I lack the confidence to confront others. It's embarrassing how much I don't catch on to things, only to stew over every interaction I've had with a person trying to figure out what went wrong. \n\nI'm in my late 30's with a crappy simple job I'm not even good at enough to get respect in that department of my life. Every time I talk to a coworker and be friendly, it just seems like they aren't taking anything I say seriously or like they are gathering things from me to make fun of me later in conversation. \n\nGrowing up I can't tell you how many times a person asked me \"You thought we were friends?\" and laugh in my face. All that time I knew in the back of my mind something was up. \n\nStrange thing is, my intuition I found is very good in reading people and situations, but my hope or fantasy that it isn't true overpowers my common sense. I know these people don't really give a shit about me, yet I just fall for it, and end up embarrassing myself. It's to the point of delusion, where compliments from them make me feel confident about myself and my abilities for a short while until i realize it's all BS or a joke. \n\nThen there are the good people, who want to believe I'm mysterious and have some kind of hidden interesting character or talent, but when trying to help me or be my friend they tend to give up on me. It's so painful how slow rejection is, they want to see you less and less, and eventually it's as if they never existed in your life. \n\nMy intuition is good, I notice when things are off or bullshit, but not good enough to really put it all together until it's too late. This aspect of me is turning me into a bitter and sad person. I know socializing takes practice, but I'm just tired of embarrassing myself... \n\nNo one truly gets to know me, or has the patience, but I accept that. I have the motivation to do something about my issues, but I don't have the confidence that I'm smart enough. Even writing this took me forever and I still don't feel what I'm trying to get across is clear enough. \n\nWhat do I do? Where do I start? How do I get smart and socialize more without making an ass of myself or falling for bs? Or is that just a normal experience for everyone and I think the grass is greener on the other side?",

The only thing is, I don’t know if I should get rid of them; what if I’m not good enough to be happy with myself? \n\nFor instance, I’m ADHD, so I’ve become extremely inhibited in order to stop being so hyperactive, talkative, and silly. I want to let loose and be myself, but I a know how it will end, despite being much better at identifying people’s boundaries, picking up on social cues and reading the reading the room. \n\nI’m also not very attractive. This isn’t a matter of me being overweight, and having that hide some otherwise good features. I’ve always been lean, and athletic, and I’m as strong and muscular as ever. Why shouldn’t I be critical of my body language? Why shouldn’t I be critical of the way I dress? Why shouldn’t I be nervous around people, when they are more likely to dismiss me or judge me negatively due to my looks? Why should I feel comfortable if I know I won’t be okay? I know I won’t be judged fairly so I have to be great in all other visible aspects.\n\nNone of these things are irrational, they’re very real. These are areas I struggle in while everyone else coasts through without trying. “Chasing perfection” to me is just trying to be like everyone else. \n\nRadical self-acceptance can only go so far. Yes, don’t beat yourself up, but I think it’s dangerous to not be worried about these things, and I think it would be delusional to try and be happy with myself as I am. Not all uniqueness is good.",

        "text": "okay, more context than that.\n\nMy last relationship was so, so toxic. I was with an abusive man who took my daughter, publicly shamed me (it was lies, he deleted it but it was too late, this is a whole awful story in itsself) - it took so long for me to leave, when I finally did, I felt freedom for the first time maybe ever. I also grew up with an abused narc mother and fell into the same pattern with that guy. I've had to do a lot of growth to figure out how to break these patterns.\n\nMy best friend, we've been best friends since we were 15 years old. He'd never tried anything with me in that time - we've been with each other through relationships and breakups over the years, dark times and amazing ones. He's the only person on this earth I ever want to hang with, he always has been.\n\nBut the thing is, when he told me how he finally felt about me - I was not in any capacity for it. He essentially gave me an ultimatum. He couldn't just be my friend anymore. But I couldn't even see him like that at the time. I, for the first time in my life, was doing my own thing. I was sleeping with a few people and learning what detachment is. I was doing whatever the F%&amp; I wanted at the time, it felt great, and I didn't want to let it go. (This is not an excuse, just the truth).\n\nMy best friend and I ended up sleeping together together over covid. From that second on, he considered us together. I had to work myself into the idea even though I knew it would be the best thing for my family and I had to had to try. Probably a month into it, I went back to work after the lockdown, saw my manager I had been banging, let him walk me out to my car and we started to hook up but stopped. It just wasn't right. Around the same time I had been texting this dude that we randomly shared stories, but I wasn't into him. This doesn't need to make sense to anyone it just truly is what it is. I was dishonest, I disrespected his feelings, I was being selfish, and I was wrong. I wasn't ready and I should of listened to myself and because I didn't I disrespected someone else. \n\nIt took me a few months into my relationship to really start to fall for my best friend. It wasn't instant for me. I look back on it, and maybe it was, but I was so jaded - I just was having a hard time processing things. I eventually did stop, I put all of my energy into him, and we decided to start a family. I knew I was going to be alone for the rest of my life happily before him because I have a 6 year old daughter I'd never bring around anyone - but the thing is, he's known her since birth, and she's loved him since then. She thinks of him as her dad, and she calls him papa. She deserved that. \n\nHim and I are perfect. He treats me like I couldn't dream of being treated. He'd brush my hair with me, shower with me just to lather me with soap and feel that closeness to me. I cherished every single part of him and I that past stuff, wasn't even on my mind at all anymore. I knew it was just a weird time for me and I learned from it and moved on - but now I realize that's shitty of me for thinking I could get off that easy. The thing is, I'm human. I am very forgiving of human, non-malicious mistakes. I am very understanding when people wander because I think it's human nature. It's not human nature to lie or disrespect though, which I did. \n\nOn the day of our baby shower for our son, he read through old text messages on an old phone I had from years before and found out all of this stuff. The thing is, it felt like two separate times to him because he went through my phone two separate times, but it was all old shit from the end of the lockdown. That doesn't make it better for him, I understand. But I live my own personal hell everyday for the choices I made, and I told him that I know it would take work if he decided to stay with me but I'd do anything to prove anything to him. And I have since then. And he decided to stay with me. \n\nThe thing is, since then, he's grown a temper for me. And I know its out of resentment. If I pack a chair wrong, or if I pass the wrong gas pump he wants to go to, etc - he's even punched two holes in my door. This is NOT HIM! I feel like I broke him! And he's said it before too, that I ruined him. I do KNOW that I am not responsible for others actions, but I genuinely love him and I want him to move on and be happy with someone he wants. but he says its me - he just wont acknowledge his resentment towards me and he makes everything we're about to do a traumatic time. I am not making excuses for either of us - I genuinely want to know if there's a way to fix this, or I have to lose him and live in my own choices the rest of my life, even though I've been so great to him since then and while he's amazing to our family 75% of the time, that 25% is just so hurtful and deep ---- are we ever even? does it HAVE to be over?\n\nHe's only saying things to hurt me now.  He'll tell me I'm my moms seed just because he knows how abusive she is and how hard I try not to be her. He said he hates our family dog to our core, because I know he knew it would hurt me. He'll tell me I'm my moms seed just because he knows how abusive she is and how hard I try not to be her. I know that sounds so small, but how could you hate something your family loves? I'd never bash anything he loves. It gets way worse but these are just a few examples.\n\nI feel I'm manic, rambling right now, because this is all coming to a head. I've told him, the way he feels about me, I just think subconsciously he hates me, or doesn't forgive me, and I totally understand. But he says that's not the case. He left today, said I was the one who needed space so he could go out to lunch with his friends. Like, I'm sorry but say YOU need space! Now I'm over here being ignored because you acted like you were giving me space?\n\nWhat do I do right now? Is there ANYTHING OTHER than walk away? Our relationship was so pure, genuine and precious, I'd do anything to help heal what I've caused. I also don't want my daughter and son to get separated. My daughter loves him so much, I don't ever want her to feel separate from her brother -\n\nthis is just too much for me to bare, I feel in such a dark place - I cannot figure out how to move forward. It feels like I can't right my wrongs in this life.",

I really want to not exist, but I think I am getting better and that scares me. Last month I caught myself calling my mistakes \"Silly\" instead of repeatedly saying \"Idiot, stupid idiot\" and scratching my neck and arms. I immediately started internally berating myself 'Mistakes are not silly. Idiot. You think that was funny? Your mistakes harm others. It makes it harder for them.' I stopped calling them silly after that and felt relief.\n\nI used to feel like I was sinking. Now I feel like I am laying face down in the kiddy pool to scared to stand up and face the world. I think I want to get better now but every time I try I berate myself until I feel worse. I don't even know why I am sad. I have a loving home and have never been abused or anything awful. I just don't like myself.\n\nI have been thinking about that time 6 years ago. I don't know why I tried. I was sad, yes, but I didn't know why. I just sat over the railing and wondered why, climbed down and cried. I have much more reason to do it again now. If I wanted to I would, but I am feeling fine I guess. I have never told anyone about the attempt. Should I? I don't want to worry anyone. I think I am ready for help now but I don't want to tell anyone anything. I made this account today for a reason. I feel like I am in a kiddy pool. Just laying here thinking. Hoping someone else would just grab me by the limbs and force me up. I don't really have the energy to lead the way.\n\nI don't know what to do. I never thought I had depression. I thought I needed to have a reason. I think I did have one but it was dumb and I didn't even remember it back then. I think I want to feel better but I don't want to try. Can I ask you for advise?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI posted this in the depression subreddit but I think that was the wrong place. I am reposting here because I want advice.",

        "text": "\nI've had a traumatic childhood. The type that would break a person. I had to be my mother's emotional support system at the most tender age. My brain developed around emotions in a very weird way. \n\nI did not cry or let myself break for a number of years. Crying was not an option. \n\n\nOne day, i broke. I allowed myself to break down and cry. I was not able to recover after that. I lost all control over my emotions, after that. The easiest thing is to make me cry, now. \n\n\nMy husband is a great guy. He has been through alot as well, and he's a brave man. He's someone i look up to. He deserves a brave WOMAN. Not a girl. I want to become strong, i want to become brave emotionally. Blood and guts dont scare me, but the thought of losing him or him starting to lose feelings for me because of my horrible grip over my emotions, scares the hell out of me. \n\n\nHow do i become a strong woman? I believe I'm still young (19), so it shouldn't be TOO hard. Sure, i could ask my therapist, but I'd rather not drag it. Id rather not be told to do a number of exercises before starting the process of becoming a strong woman. \n\n\nHow do i NOT cry at the simplest things? How do i not overthink and scare myself of things that probably won't even happen? How do i stop being a lil fragile girl? \n\n\nI've promised my husband that I'd become someone he'll be proud of, someone he can lean on when he becomes weak, someone that will make sure he remains sane (and doesn't lose all the hair on his head due to stress lol). \n\n\nHow do i do it? Because a promise is a promise, especially one made to my husband. I HAVE to do this.",

        "text": "I just turned 29M and ever since I’ve been feeling depressed and lost. I want to do something about it. I don’t want to feel like a loser next year when I I’m 30.\n\nA lot to unpack. I’ve always been pretty unmotivated and lacked real ambition. I also tend to run away from my problems. I’m pretty narcissistic, and have a pretty low empathy level as well as being an introvert which makes it hard for me to connect with new people. I feel like I’m pretty toxic too, but never had the self reflection to really expand on it. Never finished college, no car, I want to improve my life but I don’t have a clear action plan.\n\nEven though I’m extremely introverted, I somehow have been blessed with a collection of extremely good friends. When meeting new people though, I never try to get to know them and I feel like I’m pretty boring to talk to unless I think we have similarities. This closes a lot of doors for me and I don’t know why I’m like this. I tend to just ignore people, even though they reach out to me and want to talk. I feel like I’m a bad friend at times when my friends treat me so well, like they always support me but I’m emotionally unavailable. \n\nIt’s not like I can’t talk to people, but generally I don’t want to and I won’t make an effort at all.\n\nWhen I dropped out of college at 23 (low ambition, fucked around all day) me and my current best friend  started a business together. I worked pretty hard at it, mainly due to my best friend always being there to push me and make sure I’m not slacking off. We actually came really far, from operating it in his garage with 3 machines to having a 6000 sq ft warehouse with 27 machines and 10 employees. We had to heavily reinvest any profits we made to make this happen, so over the years I haven’t pocketed a lot of money. I currently make about 65k/yr, but that’s due to this year being pretty rough. 2021 I made about 80k. \n\nLately though I’ve been feeling a little burnt out from doing this so long - I’m hoping I can find my focus and passion again. Like I’m currently at work writing this out because I’ve been feeling so detached and distracted. It feels like I have ADHD at times, because I can’t seem to focus a lot of the times.\n\nI have a substance abuse problem too - mainly weed and alcohol. I smoke very frequently through the day, and I drink a 6 pack a day when I get home. I am extremely fit as I’ve been going to the gym every day for the past 10 years, but I feel like I’m using these substances to escape something. I feel like being high makes me more introverted, but quitting both of these will be a big challenge. \n\nIn terms of relationships I’ve had a few over the years, didn’t work out. I’m not sure what I’m looking for and currently I don’t think my mental health is well enough to date. I have a small but close group of friends I see every two weeks or so, and I live with my best friend and business partner that I see every day so I don’t know if I’m lonely, even if I feel lonely. My best friend is an extreme extrovert, and is constantly trying to break my shell. I love him to death. I never speak about my problems though, I’m the type to just keep everything inside which is not ideal. My best friend doesn’t know about all of this, even though he might pick up on my sadder than normal behavior.\n\nThis year I want to be better.\n-\tI want to start taking a look at my mental health as well as understand my emotions more. Maybe a therapist would help?\n-\tI want to be more social and be easier to talk to\n-\tI want to be a good friend just like how good my friends are to me\n-\tI want to be more empathetic, and stop looking at the world from a narcissists POV.\n-\tI want to regain my passion to work on my business and better my future as well as make more money\n-\tI want to learn how to drive and ultimately get a car (I live in NYC so commuting isn’t terrible) main thing is a car is pretty out of my budget (my rent is 1700, parking where I live would be 400/month) if I stop drinking though I could probably save 5-700/month.\n-\tI want to stop drinking so much (quitting alcohol altogether might be hard, but I want to do better than a 6 pack a day)\n-\tI want to stop smoking weed as I feel like it’s making me more introverted and comfortable with where I am.\n\nEven if no one reads this, writing this out felt pretty good. It felt like the first step. If anyone has resources or tips for me, I would gladly take a look and would appreciate it very much.",

I didnt do anything special, i didnt really change up my shedule, i just started appreciating everything that i already have, and i stopped worrying abt the things that i want. This mindset helped me so much, and i literally cried bcs i noticed it was the first time in months maybe years that i felt happy while being alone. I had a genuine smile on my face, even tho im all alone atm. I just wanted to share this experience, and maybe motivate some other people. Bcs in the journey of my self improvement, mentally, i didnt think i could do it, and you reading this probably dont think so either. Only at the moment that u achieved what you were fighting for, then u will feel the happiness, and only then you realize it was all worth it.\n\nEven if you self improvement journey is more on the physical side, then i think its the same story. U will get there, everyone will. I believe in you and if anyone wanta to talk i will be here to talk",

During those 4 years, I’ve also battled with severe depressions during those times. The last year has been the light at the end of the tunnel. I’ve improved on myself drastically, but still have no social connections. During the last year I’ve been smoking an ungodly amount of weed (literally stoned 95% of the time, day and night), and I realize that if I stop, I will fall back into my depression. I don’t want to be smoking weed this much because I’m concerned about the health and memory effects, but if I stop for even a day I’ll be in a worse mood than usual, and eventually become depressed again. I would rather be smoking all the time than be depressed like I was, but do you think it’s possible to significantly reduce the amount of weed that I smoke, while not being depressed even if I have no social connections? I feel like the solution is to make friends obviously, but given my situation, I’m hopefull that I will make friends in the future, but I’m still on the solo road for now, and probably will be as I’m quitting my job soon and my job was my main source of socializing by chatting with my coworkers.",

        "text": "I am writing here, inspired by the community, and the generosity some of you have demonstrated in sharing  reflections, solutions and in holding space for those of us struggling. \n\nI am writing, desperate for a solution to my rage. I read a few threads before writing this, and I saw that some ppl had recommended rage rooms (which I'll be trying out) and singing at the top of our lungs in the car  (I do that sometimes ) but the issue here is a little deeper as I am recognizing a recurring pattern. \n\nEvery couple of years, for the past few years, when I'm accepted into a new job or a new study program, I begin to work, things are going ok at first, and then I quickly start to realize that certain things aren't going to be easy to deal with, like in my current situation: my supervisor having a bad temper and since we share a room, I'm exposed to her angry phone calls (literally from 10 AM to 5 PM for many days on end), or I'm being excluded from certain things at work because they would rather train someone else, or that my projects are being held back due to another team's inefficiency, so my work gets jeopardized, and somehow I keep being blamed for others' inability to deliver....as things pile up, my tolerance decreases. \n\nHow I react to these things initially is by remaining calm, breathing through the day and usually it works fine. However, given that much of these things are out of my hands, and I can't seem to find ways of resolving them, they gradually pile up. I tell myself this is supposedly 'normal' at any work place, but then I ask myself, what can I do to turn things around? I can't change my boss's temper, nor can I ask the management to include me in more things (I actually tried) and the others' inefficiency is really out of my hands. The only thing I can control is my reaction, so I usually focus on work, knowing that I am a hard worker and like to get things done to the best of my ability. After a certain point, perhaps when things aren't done and it's a few days before the delivery date, or we've reached a dead end somehow, eventually I become enraged, to the point that I can't handle my reaction. I snap at my boss, I cry, I talk to someone, the entire office knows that I'm not happy with how things are going,  and I have a deep urge to get the hell out of this place. Sure, I could quit (which is what I'll be doing in this case) but then the situation keeps happening again and again in different contexts, the parameters are different yes but the feeling is the same. Factors that are totally out of my control affect me so much that I become enraged, usually on righteous grounds: I am worried about the work for example, or I see something wrong and it has to be fixed, etc. \n\nI've done so much work on myself through therapy, somatic practices, etc. in the past few years, that I am very down seeing that a few months into a new job, so much of my anxiety is back, I can't sleep, nor eat properly, and I got into loops of obsessive thoughts about situations that happened, and my reactions to them. This weekend I wanted to disconnect and went to a forest with friends, being in nature I thought would help, instead, because of the obsessive thoughts, I had to sit aside and a shortly after we arrived, I left. I went home to cry and scream and all. It feels like an alarm in my body that won't go off. I'm tired. Help? Can rage become productive? How can it serve us? What is anxiety trying to tell us?",

I made my room somewhat cozy, but I still need to move, since I don't really like my apartment (finding another one is difficult though).\n\nWhen the evening has passed and it's really night, like 11 pm or later, the depression usually somewhat fades. Because then I chill on the couch, everything is dark except of some cozy lights, and I watch my favorite show.\n\nThe time in between is really hard. Even if the artificial light is bright, it feels always weird. But it's not summer, I can't chill on the couch from 6 pm onwards (it currently gets dark at 6 pm in my area).\n\nOften I come home around 8 pm and those 3-4 hours are really hard, and I have to cook for dinner either, when I just want to hide from the world.\n\nAny ideas?",

        "author": "joshias",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/11avhyw/how_to_actually_change/",
        "text": "You've probably encountered a lot of repetitive advice about how to get stuff done...and it never really worked. This is about what ***actually*** works.  \n\n\n# You change through learning, not action\n\nMost of the change happens without action. You are \"fighting\" with yourself; it's all *internal*. The action comes *after* you've changed. The brain circuits for change and learning are the same; personal change *is* learning.\n\nIf what you are learning is just something in your short-term or explicit memory (which is about information), it doesn't really change your behavior. It needs to be converted into your long-term and implicit memory (which is about understanding), and then it can change you.\n\nYou have to *understand* and recall it, *internally*; and not take it in externally over and over again. To understand it, you'll need to play and experiment with it. \n\nWhen you consume valuable content (video, book, article, post, etc.), take a moment to *pause* and give it time to sink in. Think about it; reflect on it. What did it say? What do you think about it?\n\nLet your mind play and experiment with the information. The more you recall and reflect on that information, the more you learn and understand it, which will make it impact you more and facilitate related change.\n\n# Feel your pain\n\nNegative emotions *are* change. The more you feel them, the more you allow them to change you. When you avoid them, you avoid growth.\n\nThe more negative emotions you accumulate, the worse you'll feel and the more you'll crave distractions. It also takes a lot of energy to suppress them.\n\nIt's really important to *feel, allow and accept* your negative emotions - because when you don't deal with them, they will deal with you until you deal with them.\n\n*Feel* your negative emotions; feel your pain. Let it guide you.\n\nIt becomes easier to change, and you'll naturally feel more motivated (and better!).\n\n# Process your emotions\n\nProcessing emotions allows you to unlock more energy, while also discovering how your negative emotions are affecting you, what's actually important to you, and what's actually wrong. It becomes easier to change, and you'll naturally feel more motivated (and better!).\n\nWe evolved with a lot of time and space; that's how we processed emotions. Allow your mind space, without a clear mental goal.\n\nYou can go for walks, hike, clean or organize something, cook, color a coloring book, puzzle, exercise, etc. **BUT** don't combine it with anything (no music, multitasking, etc.)\n\nYou can also journal and write about experiences that are emotionally engaging for you, whether positive or negative, or you can write about your day, week, thoughts you have or just anything you want to write down.\n\nIt's about giving your mind time and space to process, which it will do on its own, so there isn't really a right or wrong way to journal. Just write, without a clear mental goal.\n\nDo an activity like this regularly.\n\n# Limit your desires\n\nWe generally tend to move toward goals we set. Our mind remembers our tasks and reminds us to do them throughout the day; and because it keeps track of them, the more of them we have, the more our mind gets drained; it becomes more difficult to act on these tasks and on your conscious motivation.\n\nEach desire, intention, or goal you have is a psychological burden for your subconscious that pulls at you until it's completed.\n\nReduce the amounts of tasks your mind keeps track of. Focus on what you can and will do now. Do what you are putting off now, abandon it, or write it down.\n\nYou can also fix things from the past your mind might be burdened with. Forgive yourself for things you might have done wrong or failed to do. Apologize to people you didn't treat well. By doing so, you'll gradually unburden your subconsciousness and be able to do what your consciousness tells you.\n\n# Use your impulses\n\nThroughout the day, we often have impulses toward behaviors we would like to integrate. Try to notice and act on them. It'll make the behavior *easier* to start.\n\nYou encourage your mind toward the preferred desires with the proper inputs; the people or things you surround yourself with, the content you engage with, what you talk about, by thinking about or reflecting on things, etc.\n\nYour mind will create related impulses, which will make it easier to start doing it, to get the process started.\n\nYou might not do as much as you expected of yourself, and that's okay...but don't punish yourself! (more about it later)\n\n# Stop your addiction\n\nThe worse we feel about ourselves, the more likely we are to distract ourselves. We tend to use distractions for emotional suppression and not having to face our emotions. It doesn't just have to do with your laziness or lack of discipline, it's that you are suffering - it's about your internal emotional state. Then you get sucked into it and you blame yourself for it.\n\nWith that self-blame and lack of compassion, you set yourself up to repeat it again the next time.\n\nSo to reduce your \"addiction\" with social media, or other distractions, process your emotions and feel your emotions (as mentioned above), *and* don't fill yourself with negative emotions by punishing yourself for having engaged in it...\n\n# Don't punish yourself\n\nAfter we do something \"productive\", we often punish ourselves and don't reward ourselves, because we expected more of ourselves. If we punish ourselves for it, our brain will reinforce avoidance toward being productive.\n\nInstead of punishing ourselves, it would be helpful to cultivate ways for our brain to enjoy being productive.\n\nAfter having engaged in the behavior you want to cultivate, instead of punishing yourself and noticing what you did wrong, notice what you did right. \"I exercised for 5 minutes, it's great that I exercised :). Maybe I can exercise for 5 minutes tomorrow again, or maybe even 7!\" As you go through that, you are reinforcing the desire toward that behavior.\n\nAdditionally, practice gratitude. This is really helpful to cultivate the preferred desires.  \nIf the progress you make is met with negativity in your mind, you'll naturally feel inclined to avoid taking a step forward. When this happens, when your mind responds to your step forward with that negativity, practice gratitude. Acknowledge that there are negatives, and appreciate the positives. This will naturally incline you to do it again next time.  \n\n\n**TL;DR (+ MORE PRACTICAL ADVICE)**\n\n\\- Pause. Allow really valuable content to sink in.  \n\\- Feel your negative emotions, rather than avoiding them.  \n\\- Process your emotions, by removing distractions and allowing your mind space (going for a walk, sitting with yourself, etc.)  \n\\- Try to become aware of your natural impulses and act on them  \n\\- Try to be compassionate with yourself, don't hate yourself for not being where you want to be  \n\\- Practice gratitude  \n\\- Don't punish yourself  \n\\- Think things through for yourself; when you internally understand it, it becomes part of you  \n\\- Like, upvote, or save things you find *really* valuable to revisit it  \n\\- Unfollow everyone that doesn't contribute to who you want to become.  \n\\- Get Unhook (YouTube, for Desktop Browser)",

Utterly haunting.  I hit pause, and looked up the lyrics.  For better or worse, those words dovetailed perfectly with my feelings about this woman.\n\nThe rational part of my brain is struggling to tell me to get over someone I literally just met and barely know.  But meeting her was so intoxicating, as were the six weeks of flirty texts and the buildup to her hosting me at her home.\n\nThat damned song keeps going in my head, triggering the same messy melange of feelings - walking hand in hand with her all over San Juan, the mixed messages and bizarre inconsistent way she treated me at her California home, and the complete silence after I left.\n\nThis is how I'm dealing with it: I rediscovered one of my favorite songs - Woodkid's \"Run Boy Run.\"  Propulsive, upbeat, and triumphant.  The official video for it has killer imagery, too.  Every time I think of \"Song To the Siren\" I tell myself to \"stop it\" and substitute in \"Run Boy Run\", as I'm a DJ spinning records live, sensing the crowd's disapproval over a particular choice, then swapping something else onto the turntable.\n\nI even put the letters \"RBR\" on an index card which I'm going to tape to the dashboard of my car.  I'm a freelancer who drives between client sites, so I'll constantly see this reminder throughout the day.",

        "text": "# Which Door Would You Choose?\n\nImagine there's two doors in front of you. One is wide open, and you can see everything happening inside. And my golly, you are liking what you see. You see all your friends partying together, having a good ole time. Bruno Mars is in the corner moonwalking, money is falling from the roof, everything is perfect, and life is easy and fun. And since everyone you know and love is there, you wanna join them.\n\nBut before you do, you turn your attention to the second door, and the first thing you feel is coldness. The door is closed so you can't see inside, but the room's dark emptiness seems to creep under the doorframe, grasping at you. You press your ear on the door, just to get some sense of what's going on behind it –– but you hear nothing.\n\nNow, what door would you go through? I'm guessing you chose the open one.\n\nWhy would you go through the closed door when you have no clue what's behind it? On top of that, why would you grow through it when looking at it filled you with dread? Forget that. I'm gonna go where my friends are so I can join the party and get Bruno Mars to show me how to moonwalk.\n\nLife is so much easier when we know exactly what we're getting into, but not so much when we don't. When we don't know what'll happen, it's like standing right in front of that closed door. Feeling all that dread of going in, plunging into the cold darkness waiting for us. Most of the time, when faced with that door, we run.\n\n## Meet The Unknown\n\nThat door stops so many people from doing things they've never done but want to, from going after their dreams and changing their life. That door is the unknown, and until we learn how to take it on headfirst, we'll never reach our potential or the life of our dreams.\n\nThe unknown is why you quit before you try. And even if you do try, the unknown is why you give up because you aren't sure whether or not you'll reach your goals. The unknown is the biggest reason why your life never changes.\n\nSo, if you genuinely want to stop quitting before you try or to stop giving up when you do try, you have to embrace the unknown and all the uncertainty that comes with it. If you don't embrace the unknown, you're just gonna keep getting the same thing from life. You’ll stay in the known. You'll have that sense of familiarity and comfort, things will seem easy, and nothing major will surprise you.\n\nAnd that seems like a good way to live, doesn’t it? It isn't.\n\nSure, if you're exactly where you wanna be in life, and you don’t wanna change anything, then it is a good thing I guess. But, because you're here, I know you aren't where you wanna be. And I know that that gnaws at you. You know you're leaving so much on the table, you see the potential inside of you, and you want more than anything to reach the version of success you have in your head.\n\nBut... What if things don't work out? What if you give months, even years, of your time to get more from life, and you end up with nothing? What if you aren't as great as you think you are? These doubts swarm and attack you every time you set a goal. Whether it's to lose weight, start a business, or even to talk to that cute person across the room. You doubt yourself. You feel a chest tightness, a stomach drop, and struggle to to move forward and commit. You feel paralyzed from opening that door and embracing the unknown.\n\nInstead, you return to the open door, the known, and step back into it. You drive past the gym, clock in for another shift, and walk by that person. And your life, as you know it, stays the same.\n\n## Embrace The Unknown\n\nFor a while, it's nice and easy to walk by the unknown for the known, and for most people, that feeling lasts forever. Forget the unknown!\n\nBut for you, it doesn't. Because as you're sitting in the familiarity of your world, all you can think about is what's behind that closed door. What if you just went to the gym, started that business, or talked to that cutie? What would've happened? You don't feel good anymore. You feel disappointed, and you beat yourself up for not doing what you know you wanted to do. The unknown forced you to quit before you even tried.\n\nIt's time we say enough.\n\nIf you want anything in your life to change and reach ANY of your goals, you have to march to that closed door, yank it open, and march straight through. But how can you do that when it seems so intimidating? By getting to know it. See, the unknown has its own signature, and if you can learn to see when the unknown is trying to leave its mark, it's easier to embrace it. And that's exactly what I've had and still have to do every single day as I work to grow my YouTube.\n\nI have to step into the unknown, face its signature mark and not let it knock me down and keep going. And while sometimes it can feel overwhelming and every part of me wants to run and give up, I don't. I recognize this is just a sign of the unknown, which means I'm on the right path, and I've got to keep going. No matter what.\n\n## How To Embrace The Unknown\n\nSo how can you do this too? It all comes down to awareness of your thoughts, emotions, and why.\n\nMost of us have the same doubts and emotions when faced with the unknown, but hardly anyone analyzes them from an outside perspective. I'm asking you to start. Think about your goals and write down all your disempowering thoughts around them, plus the emotions you feel.\n\nSo for me, when I think of growing a following, I think, \"No one is watching my stuff. I'll never make it.\" \"What if I spend months doing this, and it's all for nothing?\" \"I'll never be able to support myself doing this.\"\n\nI also feel stressed, overwhelmed, sad and hopeless. And I feel/think these things every time I post something that gets low views, making me want to quit.\n\nThe past Faith would've quit too, but not anymore. Because when I feel those feelings and hear those doubts, I recognize them for what it is. That's not me; that's the unknown! I'm literally standing in the thick of it, and it's trying to push me out. So it floods my mind with doubts and my body with anxiety.\n\nOkay, so now I know what I'm feeling is part of building and establishing my new known in the unknown, but how do I stay in it long enough to do that? By bringing my why into my awareness and realizing that to reach my goals, I'll have to deal with the attacks of the unknown and keep pushing.\n\n## Ask Why?\n\nAnd that's what I do. When I feel that doubt and sinking feeling in my stomach, I ask why.\n\nWhy am I doing this? Why did I set this goal? Why am I pushing into the unknown?\n\nI'm doing it because I know I can help people like me, reach their goals. I'm doing it because there was no one to do it for me and because we need more voices to help others reach their greatness. I'm doing it because I want to be the person who changes lives and helps others unleash their potential, just like how others have done for me. And it wouldn't hurt to make a pretty penny from it.\n\nAnd just by going over my why, it's like a spark of light flashes in the unknown and drives me further in until I'm not even thinking about failure or feeling scared. No, my mind is focused on showing up, despite the lack of results and giving my best. Because I know as long as I keep showing up over and over, as long as I keep winning the battle against the unknown, and as long as I keep searching for that light switch to turn everything on, I'll finally change my life. And so will you.\n\n## TLDR...\n\nThe unknown will always get you to quit before you try. And even if you do try, the unknown will make you give up before you've figured it out. But you can take away the power of the unknown by recognizing when it's attacking, standing your ground, and returning to your why to continue down the path to greatness until you finally reach it.\n\nWrite down all your doubtful thoughts and emotions around your goals and mark those as progress triggers. That's a sign you've entered the unknown and finally making progress. Feel its heavy hand, but don't let it stop you. Keep going anyway with your shield of why pushing you forward.\n\nNow, remember, time is passing anyway. So you might as well start taking action, working on your goals right now.",

Just do what you can, and stop there.\n\nRefuse the feeling of not changing enough, it will only deter you from continuing to grow.\n\nRefuse the feeling of not making enough progress, that is only a negative comparison that uses your ego against you.\n\n1% progress is better than 0% progress.   \n\n**For example:** You want to get fit. Okay cool-- let's do push ups. \n\nAlright, I can only do 5 a day before my arms give out. Let's stop here. \n\nTomorrow comes-- okay, I can only do 5 push ups again. Let's stop here.\n\nPerfect! You did what you could and you made sure you executed. \n\nOver time, you will create progression and extend the limits of what you *can* do. Maybe you throw in some planking, some jumping jacks. \n\nDo you want to get off social media? Start small-- just turn off notifications. You wanna stop using Reddit? Remove the app off of your phone so you're not tempted to use it at work. Just use it when you get home-- this reframes the use of the site / social media as a reward rather than a dopamine hit. \n\nAVOID TRYING TO CHANGE TOO MUCH ALL AT ONCE. THIS WILL ONLY CREATE A HUGE GOAL THAT YOUR MIND WILL AVOID AND NO PROGRESSION IS MADE. FOCUS ON WHAT SMALL THING YOU CAN CHANGE, RIGHT NOW, AND REPEAT THAT EVERY DAY. IF YOU CAN DO A LITTLE MORE ON THE THIRD DAY, GO FOR IT!",

I can’t shake the sense that I am being left behind, and that his life is going to be tons better than mine (I live in a third world country, he’s moving to a first world country - better job, better life essentially better everything) \n\nI know the healthy thing is to stop comparing myself to him, but I can’t stop thinking about how easily he will move on and how fantastic his life will be. \n(These thoughts are constant!) \nI would like to stop ruminating about these thoughts and focus more on my journey. Any thoughts or ideas on how I can do this?",

My friend who is 15 will be writing his board exams (he's 15) this year. As I am from India, board exams for high schoolers are  \nconsidered very important. He doesn't believe in himself and thinks that he will fail the exams. I am good in my studies and i promised him that i will make sure that he passes in his exams. Now I have two choices- I can either join a gym or teach him. I also have also decided that i will be working a minimum wage job in my holidays. I have holidays for three months (March, April, may). I am not in shape and I am fat(I weigh 85kgs). I want to work and go to the gym. I also have to help my friend in his studies. So what do you think I should do?",

I made a fool of myself and now I feel he will always see this side of me. I'm so ashamed.\n\nLikewise, I've had these outbursts at work once and nearly lost my job. I've also lost other friends as a result from panic attack induced outbursts. After these events I regret my behavior and feel bad. My heart is so remorseful I cannot even begin to cope with this guilt, shame, and sadness.",

I've noticed that when setting boundaries, I often upset the person making a request or letting their expectations be known. It reveals to me that the person only valued me because of what I have to offer and not who I am as an individual. In essence, it forces people with selfish ambitions to drop their mask. It's scary at first, but I hope it becomes more comfortable with time.",

        "text": "I grew up with incredibly strict and somewhat abusive parents. I never got to do the things that so many other kids did. \n\nEventually, I put on a lot of weight and that pretty much ruined my confidence for years. I lost a ton during university, but gained it all back during Covid. I recently started going to the gym with a trainer and have been making solid progress. I think I can get to an ideal weight by the end of the year. \n\nAfter starting university and escaping from my parents, I had too much newfound freedom and ended up getting a substance problem. It’s been much better in the past year though and is almost a non-issue now. My grades suffered a lot for it though. \n\nDespite that, I still managed to get a very good, high paying job, but the hours are terrible. \n\nI have decent friends too and have traveled the world. I wear expensive, tailored clothes and eat at Michelin star restaurants but non of that brings any satisfaction anymore. \n\nI guess I just feel incredibly lonely. Given my strict parents and weight issues, a relationship was never on the table for me. Now though, I just lack the confidence. It really sucks to just miss out on such an incredible aspect of the human experience. I especially hate how some people treat it as if it’s equal to any other hobby like skiing or video games or whatever. \n\nI suppose I’m still better of now than I was a few years ago, and my confidence is better, but I still have an intense fear of rejection from my childhood (I’m in my mid 20s btw)\n\nI also have 0 hobbies other than the aforementioned which I guess makes me a boring person. I don’t blame anybody but myself for my inability to have a relationship. I mean, I wouldn’t date me. \n\nEven then, I’m not sure if that would bring me long term satisfaction. My parents hated each other. \n\nI sometimes wish I could just close my eyes and disappear. \n\nThat said, I would appreciate advice on how to increase overall life satisfaction. I can’t stop thinking about this, and it really brings me down a lot.",
