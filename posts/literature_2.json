        "text": "“Helping” (Robert Stone, 1988) is a woeful tale of Chas Elliot, a Vietnam veteran turned social work counselor who is battling his own demons and self medicating with alcohol. \n\nThe story begins with Chas in a period of sobriety - he has been without a drink and attending AA for a year and a half. The first indication that Chas will be sliding backwards is during a trip to Boston - he recognizes a kind of desolate feeling in the streets there that reminds him of his drinking days. \n\nHe returns to his work, and we meet a client that seems to irritate him to the point of rage - Blackenship. Blackenship is a homeless and mentally unstable man who frequently gets arrested committing petty crimes. He insists to Chas that he has flashbacks from his time spent in Vietnam, except that Blackenship never served there. While Chas bitterly fights this man’s false memories of a war he did not take part in, Chas’ descent quickens. The imagined recollections bring real ones for Chas, and he becomes unable to stop the thoughts from intruding. \n\nHe goes to the bar he frequented before his sobriety, and begins to drink. This leads to a bitter fall out with his wife, an unfortunate conversation with a neighbor and an emotional reckoning with his present life and future. While we don’t know the outcome, the future doesn’t look particularly bright. \n\nThis story would serve well as a cautionary tale to anyone in the habit of self medicating or struggling to maintain their sobriety. There is also a vocabulary lesson built in for the reader - I haven’t looked up so many unfamiliar words since the beginning of the anthology. I came away not only glad to have read the story, but with some new words to show for it. \n\nQuotable: “There seemed to be nothing but whirl inside of him. Unwelcome things came and went in his mind’s eye. His heart beat faster. He could not control the headlong promiscuity of his thoughts”.",

I enjoy the way he segues between scenes and transitions between moments seamlessly, so it flows like Benjy's thoughts.\n\nIt made me think about how (my preconceived idea of \"mainstream\") current readers would find the stream-of-conscious style strange, alienating or obtuse. Readers have had 100+ years of literature inspired/influenced by the modernists to get acclimated to these techniques (through Joyce, Kerouac, Woolf, Plath, and current authors like Charlie Kaufman). And yet these works are regularly deemed \"unreadable\", \"too challenging\", \"hoity-toity lit\", \"book nerd bait\", because the emphasis isn't catered around escapism or clear plotlines and escalating action.\n\nI'm mostly self-taught when it comes to literary history, theory, etc., and often I don't have a greater context for literary movements. My question is, how did readers react to the modernists? Were readers in the early 1900's as conflicted about more challenging works as current readers are? Were they immediately embraced as Important Works? Were the proponents in the minority and only proven right with time? Has there been an evolution in readers where people were less obstinate for experimentation in the past? \n\nI realize these questions are vague and the answers are probably big and sprawling and complex. I'm hoping that some Lit. nerds and maybe some professors with some free time can provide some context or info (or resources) to give me a greater context. How were these works received, both by general readers and critics?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/11ezv5t/ghost_bird_2019_by_lisa_fuller/",
        "text": "Today I’ll be reviewing the 2019 book *Ghost Bird* by Lisa Fuller, a Wuilli Wuilli woman who lives on Ngunnawal and Ngambri lands.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: In the interest of full disclosure, the author of this book and I are both part of the same writer's guild, although I've only 'met' her once in a Zoom session last year which is where I first learned about her book and decided to read it.\n\nThe author, Lisa Fuller, is an Aboriginal Australian woman. More specifically, she's a Wuilli Wuilli woman and is also descended from the Gooreng Gooreng and Wakka Wakka peoples. She's won a whole heap of awards, too. If you'd like to know more, her website is [www.lisafuller.com.au](http://www.lisafuller.com.au/) .\n\n*Ghost Bird* is the debut novel of Lisa Fuller. The book is a young adult horror/mystery novel set in a small Australian town that backs onto bushland during the 1990s. It deals with the realities of being an Aboriginal person in the modern era in a land that has been colonised. It also explores themes of racism  and sexism, and how a scientifically minded person navigates their traditional culture’s mythologies and beliefs in a modern-day environment.\n\nThe protagonist is Stacey Thompson, a young Aboriginal woman commencing her final year of high school. She lives with her twin sister Laney and their mother. Stacey is the responsible, studious daughter while Laney is the wild, rebellious one. On the first day of her final year of high school, Stacey covers for her irascible sister who sneaks out up to no good with her boyfriend while their mother is working a night shift.\n\nStacey has a bad feeling about it but puts it out of her mind. She has a bad dream about her sister being captured by someone or something. The next morning it's revealed Laney never returned from her evening adventure. Was Stacey's dream something more? While the extended family mobilises to try to find her missing sister, Stacey has to go through the motions at school while worrying about her sister's welfare, navigating family obligations and expectations, and the local community politics of a small town.\n\nOverall, I thought the whole book worked well. I found myself dreading the school scenes, not because they were bad or poorly written, but because they hit a bit too close to home for me. Not that I have experience going to school as an Aboriginal person, or as a girl, or in a small town, but I found the routine bullying, politics and lack of even-handed punishments and treatments by the teachers and staff rang a little too true to me. So, job well done by the author! Also, the lack of air conditioning in stinking hot classrooms (the only exception being the computer room) brings back memories, too.\n\nThis book is listed as a horror, but I wouldn't say it's horrific in the gory sense of a slasher movie, but it has the most effectively creepy atmosphere. Seriously, I dare you to read this and not feel creeped out. The mystery is well done because I didn't know exactly what was happening until it was all revealed. And the ending was well earned but kept me guessing right up until the very final chapter. Was her sister being held by people? By *something else*? Was she ever going to see her again? Would she survive her captivity?\n\nI thought Fuller's exploration of the extended Aboriginal family unit, and the obligations and responsibilities each person within feels, was very well expressed. The frustrations of knowing what the cultural expectations are and being torn between following them and doing what you personally think is the right thing. That tension was well explored. Also, the inter-family politics and inherent conflict between the descendants of the colonisers and those whose ancestors have been here for tens of thousands of years.\n\nAnd, while I don't have a personal or spiritual connection to Country (I'm not Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander), there are moments in this book where Fuller has written so effectively what such a connection feels like that it's the first time I've really had the sense of what it might feel like.\n\nI also think Stacey is a better person than I am because there's a harsh decision she makes in the book that haunts her but which I feel is completely justified and mightn’t personally feel guilt over. You'll know when you get to it.\n\nMy favourite character, though, was Rhiannon, Stacey's older and wilder cousin who I feel steals the show anytime she's on-page. She’s just so fun and carefree and reckless and hilarious. She’s great.\n\nAs an example of how effective the atmosphere is, the opening chapter begins with the two young girls learning knowledge of their people from their grandmother. Here is an excerpt from the end of the opening night-time scene at a campfire that really helps set the tone:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Turning to ask Laney, I have a second to register the glint of gold and a strange pendant around her neck before clawed, furred hands wrap around her throat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We both gasp at it pulls her backwards out of the firelight.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Laney!'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I spin to Nan, expecting her to move, but she's still looking into the flames.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Nan!'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She finally turns to look at me with shining red pupils. Stumbling, I feel hands grab hold of my shoulders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Be ready, granddaughter,' she whispers as I'm ripped back, screaming into the dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, this book was an effective mystery and a creepy horror. It felt very genuine, and I strongly recommend it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Discussion Points**\n\nNow for some discussion of points.\n\nFor reference, the two main groups of indigenous peoples of Australia are Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, but these two groups are not monoliths. Aboriginal Australians are based in the Australian mainland and the island state of Tasmania whereas Torres Strait Islanders live in the Torres Strait, a series of islands between the northernmost tip of the Australian state of Queensland and the country Papua New Guinea to the north (some also live on the northermost tip of Queensland, too). Some people identify as belonging to both groups. This book details with Aboriginal people only, but I'll mention Torres Strait Islanders throughout the below because many of the things I'm writing about apply to them, too.\n\nAt the point of British colonisation, indigenous Australians had been living in Australia for up to 65 000 years. Aboriginal culture in particular is regarded as the longest continuing civilisation in the world, although it took a siginficant hit when the British arrived just under 250 years ago.\n\nAt the point of first contact, there were *at least* 200 different nations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia, with different cultures and languages. For a very long time, forced assimiliation policies were enacted to compell the indigenous people of Australia to abandon their languages, cultures and beliefs. From 1910 to 1969 one-third of all indigenous children were stolen by federal and state governments and handed over to orphanages, church missions or fostered/adopted out to white families. Most native languages are going to become extinct within the next few decades. Much native culture has been permanently lost (but again, some cultures more than others --- the 200-odd different groups were not all affected exactly the same or to the same extent).\n\nIn the opening chapter, the protagonist's grandmother explains that her father told her lots of stories (including myths) that she would need to live safely in the land, but that he couldn't teach her their native language or she would have been legally abducted by the authorities to try to suppress that.\n\nA note on the term 'Country'. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders use the term differently to the traditional English language usage: Australia is a nation-state, but it's not a Country under this usage. Each group or people (of which there were more than 200) has a traditional land that they share a spiritual connection to which is their Country. The author is a Wuilli Wuilli woman who is descended from the Gooreng Gooreng and Wakka Wakka peoples, which means (as per my understanding, which could be wrong), she has heritage in three of those peoples' different Countries. But she doesn't live on her Country anymore, she lives on Ngunnawal and Ngambri lands (as per her website). I don't know much about the Ngambri, but I know I live on Ngunnawal land, too.\n\nWhen most people think of Australian history, it typically dates back to the hoisting of the Union Jack and the decalaration of British colonisation of the continent. This is seen in the book when the protagonist goes to the local museum to find information on the past, and the histories use settler history as the \"real\" history, with a few artefacts of the local Aboriginal people as curiosities only. The contrast between 250 years of \"history\" and the 65 000 years of oral tradition. There are stories told by certain indigenous groups in Australia that tell of long-extinct species, and which have been confirmed by the fossil record.\n\nThe book demonstrates the unequal treatment between a white schoolgirl and the protagonist when they both get in trouble: the other school essentially gets off with a warning and the character reflects on the fact that she would have been in much more trouble than that if she had been found to be the guilty party. When I was child in the 1990s, there was a special punishment in primary/elementary school that could only be carried out by the principal. It was called *the* *cane* and it involved whipping a child with a stick around the ankle. The only time I even knew of the cane being employed against a student was against an Aboriginal schoolboy. Now, maybe he was a known problem child and violence was necessary to contain him? No, he was the sweetest boy who never caused trouble. He was also falsely accused, so he didn't even do the 'crime' he'd been accused of. And what was he suspected of doing that was so dire that corporal punishment on a pre-pubescent child was warranted? Someone wrote an insulting note to another student. The principal felt his refusal to admit guilt or show remorse meant that violence was waranted as a fair and reasonable punishment. I disagreed then and I disagree now. I think racism was the sole reason for this punishment being doled out, and if I had been in his position a different, less violent and severe punishment would have been served up (if not a mere warning). The child ended up with a scar on his ankle, too, so I assume the cane drew blood.\n\nOn a final note, there are fantastical elements included in this story (such as the protagonist's dreams of her sister's plight) which are based upon the author's culture and traditional beliefs. It's not merely mythology and legend, to her people it's ancient religious belief.\n\nThat's all I have to say about that. I hope you found this interesting or thought-provoking. I certainly found the book to be.",

        "text": "Richard Ford’s 1986 story, Communist, is a coming age tale without any platitudes or wearied cliches. Sixteen-year-old Les is every child who was forced to grow up before their time. His father is dead, and he and his young mother, Aileen, are living off social security and waitressing tips in a desolate Montana town. \n\nAileen starts dating a man named Glen Baxter, a self described Communist and general transient. Les watches on as Glen enters and exits their lives with an almost clinical detachment. Glen arrives back after a three month disappearance with an insubstantial explanation of his whereabouts to Les and Aileen, and declares that he wants to take Les goose hunting. \n\nLes is thrilled with this proposition - his eagerness to participate in this activity with a man he barely knows and, up until this point, doesn’t care much about, indicates his very real need for male connection and an outlet for his repressed needs. \n\nAll three of them go on the trip, trespassing and poaching (Glen believes that no one should own land - Communism) and Les and Glen go on the hunt together. The scenery is magnificent - a huge flock of birds takes off into scattered flight as soon as the first shots are fired. The sights and sounds of the trip are what Les feels most deeply - though he kills two birds, his feelings about it are a mixture of disappointment and the clinical observation he utilized earlier with Glen. \n\nAileen joins them, and Glen highlights the kills for her. Les mentions one bird that Glen had shot but not killed that was still swimming in the pond. A fight erupts between Aileen and Glen about how to handle the injured bird, and the mood of the trip turns from sweet to sour. Aileen storms off, Glen realizes the relationship is done and asks Les if he would like to shoot him in the head, and Les reverts back to his clinical observations of his life: the momentary release of shared experience and living in the moment passes. \n\nBack at the house, Aileen asks Les to reassure her of her looks, and it’s at this point we know that Les has turned the corner fully into the bleak world of adults, and any youthful excitement about the prospects of life are likely behind him.\n\nQuotable: “Sixteen is young, but it can also be a grown man. I am forty-one years old now, and I think of that time without regret, though my mother and I never talked in that way again, and I have not heard her voice now in a long, long time.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I just finished A Clockwork Orange and I wanted to see some people’s thoughts about it! The slang was difficult to figure out as someone who had no idea what she was diving into, so I had to take a while with context clues and such to figure out the definitions of each word. \n\nAs such, I was wondering how everyone feels about the necessity of the slang. Does it add to the story? Does it enhance the message of the book?\n\nI’m not sure my thoughts right now, but I do know that it depersonalized me from the story. For example, I was so focused on trying to translate the actual words in the sentences that I didn’t quite realize how heinous some of the crimes Alex committed were until the final part of the book. I assume this was meant to be, but I could also just be slow and the slang was meant to have readers focus even *more* on the violent acts.\n\nIn the end, I think it added to the themes of the story, as it made Alex less detestable as a character. It highlighted, in my opinion, the philosophical ideas about good vs. evil and the causes of what makes one “bad” more so than enhance the reading experience. \n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "I just finished reading The Double and I wanted to see how everyone else interpreted the story.\n\nMy interpretation is basically that the story is about how society forces is all to eventually put on masks and become deceivers and flatterers to survive in it. Mr Golyadkin is portrayed to be a meek pushover, but in the end, is an admirably honest person without a single bad bone in him. His straightforwardness and honest nature naturally sets himself apart from a society that has built itself upon dishonesty and flattery and turns him into a loner.\n\nI don't think Mr Golyadkin's twin is actually real, but is only a personification of Golyadkin's darker side. The side of him which is tempted to become a bad natured flatterer who sucks up to everyone in order to gain advantage in society.\n\nThe ending of the book is the strongest part of it in my opinion. It represents the victory of Golyadkin's temptations to evil and dishonesty and the admission of his good natured, honest self as a symptom of madness. There's something genuinely horrifying about the ending that I can't quite put my finger on. The description of the Doctor's eyes as fiery and filled with hellish glee for some reason really sends a chill down my spine. It's also interesting to note that the doctor in the end is actually the double of doctor we see at the start, this double is fearful of Golyadkin because his honesty is a threat to the society that's built on dishonesty and is therefore very eager to immediately declare the honest Golyadkin as a mad man.\n\nAll that said, though I liked the ending I do think this is one of Dostoevsky's weaker works. Some parts of the books just kept dragging on for too long and it felt like a lot of section of the book just started to become redundant after a while. I get that we're supposed to feel the same way Golyadkin feels with how he's losing his mind, but sometimes I just felt my eyes glaze over the words quite frequently in this book. This was not particularly a problem in Dostoevsky's other works.\n\nWhat did you all think of the book? What are your interpretations?",

I absolutely cannot get enough of semi divine characters; people who seem to be more than human, who represent an idea. In the case of the two I mentioned, they serve as allegories for war and death respectively. They are highly intelligent, mesmerizingly charismatic, and wholly, utterly, infinitely evil.\n\nIs there another author who even comes close, or is Cormac the best to ever do it?",
