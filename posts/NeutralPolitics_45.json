Maybe I missed some of the nuance or how this EO will play with existing laws?\n\nSection 2 says this: \"In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury\"\nMaybe I'm getting lost on the long sentence structure, but it sounds like it's saying the DoT will not take adverse action against religious organizations when they talk about politics where that speech is not ordinarily treated as political campaigning. But it also says consistent with law. So what does that really mean? Isn't it already against the law for religious organizations to use funds to campaign? So what does this section really change?\n\nSection 3 (Conscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate) seemed the most concrete, but the language is written as \"shall consider\" - meaning that they don't have to implement anything from this EO. \n\nSection 4 just seems to be \"hey guys remember the first amendment when looking at laws, kthx\"\n\nSurely I seem to be missing something important here.

First time posting. \n\nFrom what I understand, this is a bill that was also pushed in 2013--here's an [NPR article](http://www.npr.org/2013/05/10/182910609/comp-time-or-cold-cash-which-would-you-pick) that outlines it in a relatively neutral way. [Here](https://www.law360.com/articles/432051/comp-time-bill-a-cruel-hoax-on-ot-employees-critics-say) are some criticisms of the bill. And [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1180/text) is the text of the bill itself.\n\nIs giving the bill more worker protections too complex, and something that would have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis? No Democrats voted in favor of the bill in the [House](http://www.natlawreview.com/article/comp-time-its-way-working-families-flexibility-act-passes-house) when it passed on May 2 2017. \n\nWhen I read the bill--and admittedly, I'm no law student--it seems like an okay idea, it just needs more work. Why has the bill not been added to and adapted to work with people's concerns? Is this a partisan issue or something more?\n\nAnd, repeating one of my title questions: what is the difference between how public sector workers are allotted flex time and this bill? Is there just more oversight since it's public sector? \n\nSorry if there are too many questions. Answer whatever you'd like, or point me in the right direction to find some out myself! ",

        "text": "We are getting a ton of questions about the AHCA and so we have decided to make a megathread on the subject.\n\nA few basic Q&amp;As to start:\n\n**What is the AHCA?**\n\nIt is the [healthcare bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) the Republican leadership in Congress has proposed to replace Obamacare.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nLots of stuff.  [Here's an article on the version of the bill first put forward in March.](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-healthcare-policy-expert-on-four-key-differences-between-the-aca-and-the-ahca)\n\n**What are the recent amendments to it?**\n\nThere have been a couple of amendments to the bill in the last few days.  The big ones are:\n\n* [The MacArthur Amendment](http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/) which would allow states to opt out of some essential health benefits requirements, as well as the requirement that insurers not charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n* The [Upton Amendment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/gop-eyes-8-billion-addition-to-win-a-crucial-vote-to-the-latest-health-bill.html) which provides $8 billion in additional funding over 5 years, with the intention that it be used for \"high risk pools\" for persons with pre-existing conditions.\n\n**What's going on with it now?**\n\nHouse leadership is currently planning a vote on the bill today.  If it passes, it would move to the Senate.\n\n**Edit 1:26 PM EDT** The New York Times is reporting a vote is expected around 1:30 PM.  [They have a live tracker of how members are voting here.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html)\n\nThe House of Representatives has a livestream available at [houselive.gov](http://houselive.gov/)\n\n**Edit: 1:59 PM** The House is currently voting on [HR 2192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2192) which would change a provision which had exempted members of Congress from the MacArthur Amendment.  It currently looks to be passing easily with support from Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\nThe AHCA vote is scheduled next I believe.\n\n**2:11 PM** THE VOTE IS ON.\n\n**2:19 PM** The AHCA has been passed by the House by a vote of 217-213.  \n\n\n\n---\n\nThis is a reminder in the comments to **please provide sources** for anything you're saying.  Even if your question is something like \"I heard X about the bill, is that true?\" Please link to where you heard X so people can see the context etc.\n\nBecause this is a megathread on a controversial issue, we will be stricter than usual on comment moderation.  And usual is pretty strict.  So please keep your comments civil, substantive, and well sourced.",

See [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) and also consider the recent proposed changes to coverage of preexisting conditions.\n\nOf course, he's rich and would have been fine either way. What would the outcome be for a poorer family in the same situation without health insurance? What about a family with health insurance? A family with preexisting conditions before the pregnancy? A family with high-deductible coverage? Etc.\n\nWhat are the major differences between how this situation would unfold under AHCA versus ACA?\n\nI understand that some of these outcomes depend on the state the family lives in and whether that state opts out of the preexisting conditions coverage clause.",

        "text": "In light of the current healthcare controversy in the US, I was wondering whether the general justification line of high drug costs - that it takes a lot of money to get a drug to market - is actually justified.\n\nFor instance, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/02/10/the-truly-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs/) has an article about drug R&amp;D with some pretty eye-popping numbers, into the $100 billion range. But this is over a 14 year period, and looking at the [annual revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_pharmaceutical_companies_by_revenue) for these same companies puts these R&amp;D costs into perspective - ultimately, they really don't seem that large a percentage of a pharma company's operating cost or expenditure. Some others have also noted that, despite the common line, [drug companies tend to spend more on advertising than R&amp;D](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/big-pharmaceutical-companies-are-spending-far-more-on-marketing-than-research/). [EDIT: Not actually true, see below]\n\nAre these numbers wrong? Can anyone else speak to, on average, how many cents-on-the-dollar of drug costs end up funding drug R&amp;D? Does that fraction bear out the argument that drug costs are high because of R&amp;D? (Generally asking in the context of US citizens, but would also appreciate international input as well.)\n\n[EDIT: I've cited a $10 billion advertising spend number below in several places. This is a [complete misinterpretation](http://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/does-pharma-spend-more-on-marketing-than-r-d-a-numbers-check) of prevailing data, and should be disregarded. Apologies in advance. Remaining question is, if both R&amp;D and marketing are not dominating cost factors, what does a pharmaceutical company actually spend all its revenue on?]",
