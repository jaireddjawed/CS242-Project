But the door was locked and even the master key didn't worked on that room. His head was pounding because of the sounds and at last while waiting for the door to open he slept outside the room.\n\nNext morning\n\n\nWhen the manager woke up, he saw that the door was open but the priest was not there. He rushed towards the main gate but the gatekeeper told that the priest left just a few minutes ago. He asked the waiter and the waiter told that before leaving he gave all the waiters of the hotel a very generous tip.\n\n\nThe manager was annoyed and he was determined to find out the truth the following year.\n\nNext year during march\n\nThe same priest came again and asked for room 39\nManager: yes you can get the room\n\nPriest:  send a  knife, a 3 inches black thread, and a 78g orange to my room\n\nAt night\n\nThis the manager didn't sleep at all and listened to the sounds coming from the room the whole night.\nIn the morning the priest opened the room and the manager went inside and said\n\nManager: What are you doing with these things at night? From where does the sound comes? Tell me quickly\n\nPriest: I will tell you the truth but you must not tell anyone.\n \nThe manager agreed\n\nBecause the manager was a loyal man he never told amyone what was going on inside the room and it remains a secret to this day.\n\n\n(Ps: I had to read the whole thing so you do too)",
